Of the total cases, 47 are currently under treatment at various hospitals in the district, health officials said.According to the officials, the blood bank at Child PGI hospital has reported a two-fold increase in demand for platelets. “In the last one month, the demand for platelets has increased to 10-12 units per day from 5-6 units. We are also getting demand for jumbo pack (having two units of blood) of platelets on a daily basis which is used for critical patients,” said Dr Satyam Arora, associate professor (transfusion medicine) at the hospital. Dr Arora also said that the hospital has been holding in-house and off-site blood donation camps to deal with the rising demand.Trilok Sharma, founder trustee, Rotary Noida Blood Bank, said that the blood bank is getting a demand for over 20 units of blood per day as against seven units a month ago. “We have been getting over 20 requests everyday for dengue patients asking for platelets, and have to arrange for donors for them from our team of volunteers. Besides, the demand for jumbo pack of platelets has also increased in the last two weeks,” he said. However, the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida, which also has blood bank with platelet facility, has not witnessed any sharp increase in platelet demand. “The hospital does not have critical patients of dengue. The daily consumption of five units of platelets at the hospital is usual and there has been no increase in demand so far,” said Dr Rakesh Gupta, director, GIMS. Of 462 cases, 382 were reported in October alone, showed the data. The first dengue case in the district was reported on September 6, while the district reported first dengue death on October 19. Meanwhile, Rajesh Sharma, district malaria officer, said that the cases are expected to decline in the next fortnight. “The peak season of dengue transmission is over now and we are expecting the cases to decline in the next 15 days. However, the health department is still on alert. We are carrying out testing in areas where new cases are being reported from and conducting extensive fogging and anti-larvae spraying drives,” he said.Dr DK Gupta, chairman of Felix Hospital in Sector 137, said that around 3% of dengue patients require platelet transfusion. “Some dengue patients require platelet transfusion as their system is unable to make enough platelets for the body despite proper fluid intake and medication,” said Dr Gupta. Hospitals prepare burn units ahead of DiwaliA four-bed burn ward has been created at the district hospital ahead of Diwali as a precautionary measure. “A team of doctors and ambulances have also been put on emergency duties which will be equipped to handle burn cases,” said Dr Sushma Chandra, chief medical superintendent of the district hospital. At Child PGI hospital too, three teams of doctors from each department have been put on alert to handle any emergency cases. “In anticipation of any kind of emergency related to burn cases and pollution-related breathing issues, all head of departments at the hospital have been tasked to ensure availability of manpower and resources (medicines and surgical consumables),” said Dr BP Singh, senior emergency medical officer at Child PGI.At Sharda Hospital in Greater Noida, a 10-bed burn unit has been created. “A special burn ward is ready that will have 10 beds. Besides, 30 beds have been kept in reserve for emergency. Also, a fleet of ambulances has been deployed for any emergency,” said Dr Ajit Kumar, director of public relations, Sharda Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/platelet-demand-rises-as-dengue-tally-reaches-462-in-noida-101635963962058.html

03-11-2021||Pune||PMC polls: Chopper rides, trips to religious places to attract voters||PUNE: Aspirant candidates come up with fresh ideas to reach out or appease voters during the election season. Helicopter rides, trip to religious places, sari distribution and cultural programmes are highlights in the run-up to the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) poll 2022, slated for February. Many political workers are also trying to encash festive season such as Diwali by announcing the killa (fort) making competition and other games. Some hoardings put up across the city by candidates have announced helicopter ride as prize for winner in the killa making competition. Mauli Darwatkar from Padmavati-Chavannagar area, a Shiv Sena leader and civic poll aspirant, said, “I have organised a competition for fort making and will give chopper ride to the winning kids. I had introduced this innovating prize a few years ago.” Darwatkar, who has been organising fort making competition for the past three years, gave helicopter rides to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s forts to previous winners. “We had organised programmes at Sinhgad and Sindhudurg forts. Former union minister Suresh Prabhu appreciated the event. Others are trying to copy it.” Yogesh Borate, another PMC poll aspirant from Warje, said, “During Navratri, I organised trips to various temples. It received a good response. I plan to organise Paithani sari winning competition.” However, not many have endorsed the move. Former Pune mayor and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Ankush Kakade termed these programmes as a wrong trend. “I have been observing the last eight to nine municipal elections. Earlier, contesting these polls was low cost. Now, money and muscle power are important. Every aspirant is spending huge money even before the ticket is announced. How much will the candidates spend once the elections are announced and ticket is allotted by their respective party,” Kakade said. During Navratri too many candidates across the party lines organised pilgrimages to religious places. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and Kasba peth legislator Mukta Tilak said that it was beyond her imagination to offer such sops. “In the name of helicopter trip, it would be cheating as only few will get the ride. Many voters do not turn up for sari distribution programmes in the city as they are fed up with poll gimmicks,” she said, adding that candidates should reach out to residents by meeting them and social work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-polls-chopper-rides-trips-to-religious-places-to-attract-voters-101635963360678.html

03-11-2021||Lucknow||Diwali diyas glow in the light of political symbolism in Uttar Pradesh||The Diwali diyas (earthen lamps) have a message apparently full of political symbolism in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh this time as they are being used to showcase the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) government’s continued focus on religious sites and marketing of government schemes like the ‘awaas yojana’ (housing scheme) under which dwelling units are provided to the homeless. With the Uttar Pradesh assembly election due in February-March 2022, the Bharatiya Janata Party is wooing potters, mainly Prajapatis (a subcaste among the Other Backward Castes (OBC)). The ruling party promoted its leader Dharamvir Prajapati as one of the seven ministers of the Yogi Adityanath government and started its caste conferences with one for the Prajapati community. The BJP is calling these caste conferences samajik pratinidhi sammelans or social representative meets.Now, this Diwali diya boost is also being marketed as proof of government’s focus on the potters’ community which used to suffer due to preference for Chinese lights over the indigenous ones earlier. The border stand-off with China and the BJP-RSS’s “swadeshi diya” push also seem to be changing the narrative. Consider the numbers: Nine lakh earthen lamps in Ayodhya, another 7 lakh plus in Varanasi and around the same number in Mathura. “In fact, the nine lakh ‘diyas’ lit up in Ayodhya on Deepotsav are actually with a purpose; each representing the housewarming ceremonies of as many people in urban UP. Additionally, another 45 lakh diyas are to be lit across the state – each of them representing the total number of homeless across rural and urban UP who got a house under the government’s ‘awaas yojana’ initiative,” said Dharamvir Prajapati, who until recently was the chairman of the state’s Mati Kala Board set up to promote the community. On October 5, during his visit to Lucknow for the Urban Conclave, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had tasked the UP government with the challenge of lighting a lamp for each of the people in urban UP who got a roof over their head, courtesy his and the Yogi Adityanath government’s housing schemes. Building on the theme, Yogi Adityanath had then directed the officials to ensure that along with Ayodhya, these diyas were lit at the homes of all those who got a house across the state, whether in an urban setting or rural. Additionally, over 30 lakh BJP booth-level cadres too have been sent Diwali gifts, which, among other things, includes earthen, lotus shaped lamps. “Kamal ka phool” or the lotus flower is the election symbol of the Bharatiya Janata Party. “It is our tradition to send gifts on Diwali. And, as a cadre-based political party, we are connecting with the cadres and sending them gifts. We believe that Goddess Laxmi comes riding on a lotus flower and hence, both for the prosperity of the cadre and our state, we believe the lotus is necessary in one way or the other,” said UP BJP vice-president Vijay Bahadur Pathak. The Muslim Rashtriya Manch (MRM), an outfit backed by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) to connect with rashtrawadi musalmaan (nationalist Muslims), too, is doing its bit to fuel the swadeshi diya initiative. “Diyas would be lit by the Manch in at least one lakh places across the state,” said RSS pracharak Mahirajdhwaj. Diwali melas at 217 places across the state too would shine bright in the light of the diyas. The main opposition Samajwadi Party (SP) is using the same diyas for a different purpose – to embarrass the government. It has directed cadres to light up a diya each in memory of farmers who died while protesting against the government’s three farm laws. “I would want each party cadre to light up a diya for farmers,” SP chief Akhilesh Yadav told his cadres. The potters aren’t complaining. Irrespective of the purpose that the political parties have subjected the earthen lamp to, in the end it is the potters’ community which is happy as, suddenly, there are far too many takers for their diyas. Rajendra Prajapati, a potter from Kanpur, said: “It is true that the business was never as good. At many places, the diyas got sold out in no time. Diwali is free from the Chinese influence this time.” He said, “From free clay to dyes to cast earthen lamps, the government has given us a lot of facilities. The government push for these indigenous earthen lamps has given the business a boost.”Potters from across the state like Ram Milan Prajapti from Gorakhpur, Sohan Prajapati from Azamgarh and Pratyush Kumar Prajapati from Kannauj said the business has picked up substantially. “Pottery work is labour intensive. We have to source suitable mud, turn it on the wheels and slow bake them in pits fired with wood and straw. But now, people upset with China over its foul play (border standoff) has renewed people’s interest in swadeshi stuff and given a boost to our local diyas,” they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/diwali-diyas-glow-in-the-light-of-political-symbolism-in-uttar-pradesh-101635961980497.html
03-11-2021||Pune||Five Maharashtra districts report lowest Covid vaccination rate as CM sets November 31 deadline||Five out of the 36 districts in Maharashtra have reported a lower Covid-19 vaccination rate, and were hence a part of the video conference held by Prime Minister Narendra Modi with the collectors of 40 such districts of across the country. The PM instructed the district magistrates to ensure that 100% of the eligible beneficiaries receive at least one shot of the vaccine before the New Year, while chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has set a November 31 deadline for all districts in Maharashtra. While metros such as Pune and Mumbai are already on their way to achieving 100% vaccination, there are five districts in the state where less than 55% of the eligible beneficiaries have got their first dose as of Tuesday.The said five worst-performing districts are Nandurbar, Akola, Beed, Buldhana and Amravati where 51.06%, 53.29%, 53.47%, 54.22% and 54.98% of the eligible beneficiaries have got their first dose, respectively. Also, less than 25% of the eligible beneficiaries in these five districts have got their second dose. Mumbai has reported the highest vaccination rate with 98.86% of the beneficiaries having received the first dose and 60.62% having received the second dose. In Pune, 94.09% of beneficiaries have got the first dose and 51.27% have got the second dose. Manisha Khatri, district collector of Nandurbar, said, “During the video conference, the PM instructed us to ensure that 100% of the eligible beneficiaries get at least their first dose. Nandurbar has been receiving a steady flow of the vaccine since August now and over the past two days (November 1 and 2), while we had set a target of vaccinating at least 50,000 people - we were able to administer 60,000 doses. As of now, we have a temporary shortage of syringes which will be sorted out soon. Despite a huge tribal population, vaccine hesitancy is not an issue for us.”However, connectivity remains a major challenge for the vaccination drive as most villages are not connected by proper roads. “We are now carrying out door-to-door vaccination because we have multiple small villages with 10 to 20 families or smaller hamlets located at faraway distances, and it is not a priority for them to leave a day’s wages and come for the sake of the vaccination. Road connectivity with these smaller villages is a problem. Also, most of these people are available only during evening hours after the day’s work and so we are planning the vaccination drive as per their convenience to meet our targets. We are also calling over 15,000 to 20,000 people daily through 50 or so of our staff members to follow-up on those who are due for their second dose. We have about one lakh people who are due for their second dose but have not taken it (both Covishield and Covaxin),” Khatri said.During the video conference, the PM instructed the district collectors and administration to avoid becoming complacent during the festive season and ensure that every eligible beneficiary is vaccinated. The PM interacted with the district magistrates of over 40 districts in Jharkhand, Manipur, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Maharashtra, Meghalaya and other states with low vaccination coverage. “We are now preparing to take the vaccination campaign to each household. With the mantra of ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ (knock on every door), every household lacking the security net of a double dose of the vaccine will be approached. Develop micro strategies keeping in mind the experience so far to go for saturation of vaccination by addressing the gaps at the local level. You will have to do your best to take your districts nearer the national average. You can take more help from local religious leaders. I have always found leaders of all religions to be great advocates of vaccination,” the PM said during the video conference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/five-maharashtra-districts-report-lowest-covid-vaccination-rate-as-cm-sets-november-31-deadline-101635961620958.html

03-11-2021||Lucknow||Retrieved from Canada, 18th century Annapurna idol to be installed at Kashi Vishwanath temple in Varanasi on November 15||An 18th century idol of Goddess Annapurna, stolen from Varanasi about 100 years ago and retrieved from Canada recently, is set to return to the Kashi Vishwanath temple in Varanasi and be installed there on November 15.The Uttar Pradesh government will take out a four-day Mata Annapurna Devi Yatra beginning in New Delhi on November 11, to take the idol to Varanasi.Chief minister Yogi Adityanath who, along with Union minister for tourism and culture G Kishan Reddy, spoke to media persons here on Wednesday, gave the detailed programme of the yatra that apparently provides an opportunity to the BJP government to reach out to the people ahead of the 2022 UP assembly election.Yogi Adityanath said senior ministers of the state government Suresh Rana and Neelkanth Tiwari will receive the idol at a programme in New Delhi on November 11. He said the ministers in charge of the respective districts will welcome the idol on the way and the yatra will reach Varanasi on November 14.The Archeological Survey of India (ASI) received the idol in New Delhi on October 15. The idol was part of the University of Regina’s collection at its Mackenzie Art Gallery when it was handed over by the university’s vice chancellor to India’s high commissioner to Ottawa (Canada) Ajay Bisaria last year.The chief minister said the idol passed through many hands before reaching the Canadian university and the Uttar Pradesh government was getting it back following the efforts of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.“Baba Vishwanath temple and Maa Annapurna have a unique connection. Maa Annapurna is believed to provide food to Baba Kashi Vishwanath and every pilgrim visiting the place gets the same as ‘prasad’ from there,” said Yogi Adityanath. Yogi said the idol’s journey will begin from New Delhi on Gopashtami falling on November 11 and the idol would be installed at the Kashi Vishwanath temple, Varanasi, on Devotthan Ekadashi falling on November 15.“I offer my gratitude to the Prime Minister for this. Gopashtami falls on November 11 and to receive the idol on this day will be auspicious. The yatra beginning from New Delhi will pass through Ghaziabad, Gautam Buddha Nagar, Bulandshahr and Hathras, and make a night halt at Soron in Kasganj. The yatra will then cover Etah, Mainpur, Kannuaj and stop for the night at Tapeshwari Devi temple in Kanpur Nagar. Next, the idol will be taken to Ram Janmabhoomi, Ayodhya via Unnao, Lucknow and Barabanki. After staying for the night at Ayodhya, the yatra will cover Sultanpur, Pratapgarh, Jaunpur and reach Varanasi on November 14,” said Yogi Adityanath.Yogi Adityanath also said with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s efforts India’s heritage has made a place for itself in the world. Besides the International Yoga Day celebrated on June 12, the Prayagaraj Kumbh has also made a mark, the chief minister said.He said Ayurveda has also received worldwide recognition during the Covid-19 pandemic.For his part, Union minister Reddy said, “We have received an idol of goddess Maa Annapurna Devi from Canada. We identified the idol through an Indo-Canada artist at the MacKenzie Art Gallery of University of Regina, Canada. Prime Minister Narendra Modi made efforts for getting the idol back from Canada. Our Prime Minister spoke to the Canadian Prime Minister on phone and the request for returning the idol was made as the idol is very important to us. External affairs minister S. Jaishankar and the Archeological Survey of India (ASI) also got in touch with the government of Canada to get the idol back from there,” said Reddy.“The Prime Minister wants this idol back at the place from where this was stolen. I spoke to chief minister Yogi Adityanath on behalf of the Union government,” he said.Reddy said the Union government has received 55 idols and paintings from abroad. A total of 42 out of the 55 idols, taken out of India in the British period, have been received after Prime Minister Narendra Modi assumed office in 2014, he said. The minister also said another 157 idols and paintings have been identified.“The Prime Minister went to USA recently and about 100 art works are in the process of being brought back from there,” he said. Reddy said other countries where the art works have been identified include Singapore, Australia, UK, Switzerland and Belgium.“Yes, we should definitely bring such idols back to our country. Taking out yatra is a good way to connect with the people ahead of polls,” said SK Dwivedi, former professor in the political science department at Lucknow University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/retrieved-from-canada-18th-century-annapurna-idol-to-be-installed-at-kashi-vishwanath-temple-in-varanasi-on-november-15-101635961141095.html

Yogi Adityanath, who annually celebrates Diwali with Vantangias or the community of forest dwellers, had first tweeted his request and followed it with a public appeal from the Ayodhya stage on Wednesday evening.In a press statement, he greeted the people of Uttar Pradesh on the occasion of Diwali, and said the illumination of 0.9 million earthen lamps in Ayodhya indicated the number of beneficiaries of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana who have been handed over keys of houses allotted to them under the scheme. He said 4.3 million houses were made available to the poor in urban and rural areas up to now.Yogi Adityanath also said that there are eight lakh (0.8 million) public representatives, party and government functionaries, along with about 20 lakh government officials in the state.“If all of them take it upon themselves, I am pretty sure that not one poor family would be left out of the celebrations,” he said.“Ensure no poor, Dalit, poor or backward is left out of the Diwali celebrations,” Yogi Adityanath had said earlier in the day.“May this festival of Diwali be very auspicious for the people of the state. May the blessings of Lord Ram be with you all,” he said.In Ayodhya, he also announced extension of the government’s free ration plan for poor till March 2022, the time by which Uttar Pradesh assembly elections would have been held.Industrial development minister Satish Mahana said he would spend Diwali with the poor as well as families of martyrs while state’s MSME minister Sidharth Sath Singh said he would spend time with slum dwellers in Noida. UP’s minister of state Dharamvir Prajapati was seen visiting slum dwellers in Agra with gifts and the state’s minister of state for minority welfare Mohsin Raza spent time with specially-abled children in Lucknow on Diwali eve.

The central railway (CR) has taken the decision to add the 229km route from the Solapur division to the Pune railway division. The process of handing over the rail route from the Solapur to the Pune division will be carried out soon. This will bring several benefits to passengers as new routes (Ahmednagar and Shirdi) will start for local or DEMU trains for them.Shivaji Sutar, chief public relations’ officer, CR, said, “This proposal is working out now and technical level works regarding handing over of the railway route and stations are being carried out. Soon, the final decision will be taken by the railways.”Currently, the Pune railway division area (531.15 km) is less than that of the Solapur railway division (981 km). After adding the route from the Solapur division, the Pune railway division area will increase to 739.43 km while the Solapur railway division area will reduce to 773.26 km. Also with this move, major railway stations such as Ahmednagar and Shirdi will be added to the Pune railway division.Shamsundar Mandhan, member of the Zonal Railway Users’ Consultative Committee (ZRUCC), said, “Once the new areas are added to the Pune railway division, there will be high chances of DEMU trains being started on a daily basis between Pune and Ahmednagar. It will also reduce the pressure on the Solapur division.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-railway-division-area-to-increase-24-stations-to-be-added-101635960600511.html
03-11-2021||Mumbai||Gangster Suresh Pujari booked in Rs50 lakh extortion case||Mumbai Police on Wednesday registered a fresh extortion case against gangster Suresh Pujari for allegedly trying to extort Rs50 lakh from a Santacruz based restaurateur. This fresh case against Pujari, who was arrested in the Philippines in October 2021, has been transferred to the crime branch. The complainant, a 51-year-old resident of Oshiwara in north-west Mumbai, owns a restaurant and bar in Santacruz (West). The complainant told the police one of his aides received extortion threats from Pujari in March this year. The gangster allegedly threatened to kill the restaurateur if he failed to pay Rs50 lakh. Fearing for his life, the complainant did not tell anyone, according to a police officer, who requested anonymity. “It was only when Pujari was arrested in the Philippines on October 15 by local intelligence services, that the complainant mustered the courage to report the matter,” the officer said. A complaint was lodged on Tuesday at Santacruz police station under Sections 387 (extortion by putting or attempting to put any person in fear of death or of grievous hurt) and 504 (Intentional insult) of the Indian Penal Code. The case has been transferred to the Anti-Extortion Cell of the Crime Branch for investigation. Pujari already has seven extortion cases registered against him in Mumbai, in addition to multiple extortion and firing cases in Thane and Navi Mumbai, a senior officer said. “He was on the run for 14 years.” In 2015, Interpol had issued a Red Corner Notice against him. Early in his crime career, Pujari was associated with underworld don Chhota Rajan and later with the Ravi Pujari gang, but branched off on his own in 2011. Both Suresh Pujari and Ravi Pujari stayed in touch and helped each other, a crime branch officer said. The officer added, “Pujari frequently used aliases such as Suresh Puri and Satish Pai. He returned to Mumbai in 2013, but left the country in three days on a fake passport.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/gangster-suresh-pujari-booked-in-rs50-lakh-extortion-case-101635959521734.html

The senior-level sources in the traffic division of Pune police stated that post-Diwali, gradually the alternate routes for the passage of the traffic would be undertaken. In the last week of October, a meeting of the Pune Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority (PUMTA) was held to plan the smooth passage of the traffic from the university chowk whenever the construction work of the flyover would start. The body drafted multiple measures to be undertaken by the various involved agencies. “In the meeting, the measures of smooth traffic passage were discussed. The SPPU chowk is one of the most important and busy chowks in the city. The Pune Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (PMRDA) has also put forward some recommendations. There is a need for infrastructure work on the additional routes planned,” said Rahul Shrirame, deputy commissioner of police for the city’s traffic division. A senior official from the Pune city traffic division requesting anonymity said that post-Diwali gradually the steps would be taken to open the additional routes through the area. According to the official, a formal notification of the change in the traffic routes could be issued post-Diwali. “After Diwali, the traffic division would start taking necessary steps. There is a heavy load of traffic at SPPU chowk and residents should not be inconvenienced especially during the festive season,” said the official. Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao on October 26 chaired a meeting with all the authorities from the various agencies included in PUMTA when a detailed plan was discussed for the traffic diversion, the opening of alternate routes, broadening of the roads and relocation of the Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) bus stops on the Ganeshkhind road that has been mired into traffic chaos.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/alternate-routes-to-open-for-traffic-post-diwali-ahead-of-multilevel-flyover-construction-work-at-sppu-101635957240021.html
03-11-2021||Gurugram||Air quality hits ‘very poor’ level a day before Diwali||A day before Diwali, air quality plunged to the ‘very poor’ category of the Central Pollution Control Board’s classification, with an air quality index (AQI) reading of 330 on Wednesday, after four consecutive days of ‘poor’ air. Residents and police officials said they will ensure that the blanket ban on cracker use is followed strictly even as instances of cracker bursting were reported from across the city on Wednesday evening.On Sunday, the Gurugram district administration had issued an order enforcing the state government’s order of a blanket ban on the sale or use of all kinds of firecrackers, including green ones, in the district. The order stated, “Any person found guilty of violation of this order shall be prosecuted and punished as per law under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code.”The city police have written to all residents’ welfare associations to monitor their respective areas and inform them if anyone is found violating the orders. Until now, 25 people have been booked in the district for violating the orders.KK Rao, the commissioner of police, said, “Special teams have been formed to keep a check on the sale and use of crackers in the city. All police stations have been directed to keep a check in their areas and to take strict action against the violators.”Prior to Wednesday, Gurugram reported ‘very poor’ air quality on October 16 and 17, when the air quality dipped due to a drop in temperatures. On Wednesday, neighbouring Faridabad also recorded ‘very poor’ air quality and Manesar reported ‘poor’ quality of air, with AQIs of 337 and 282, respectively.According to the forecast of the Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi, the air quality in the National Capital Territory is likely to deteriorate further on Thursday but remain in the ‘very poor’ category. The air quality is likely to reach the upper end of the ‘very poor’ category on Friday and Saturday, after which it is expected to start improving marginally from Sunday due to strong winds. Over the next few days, levels of particulate matter having a diameter of 2.5 microns or less (PM2.5) is expected to spike in the region.On Thursday and Friday, the mixing depth of pollutants is likely to remain at 2,000 metres and 1,900 metres, respectively, with ventilation indices of 8,000 m2/s on Thursday and 10,000 m2/s on Friday. A ventilation index lower than 6,000 m2/s with an average wind speed less than 10 kmph is unfavourable for the dispersion of pollutants. On these two days, the wind speed is likely to remain between 4 kilometres per hour (kmph) and 8kmph.Residents said that they have constituted quick response teams for patrolling their respective areas along with police officials to ensure that the ban on crackers is followed.Gaurav Wahi, a member of a ‘Suraksha’ team from DLF Phase-2, said, “We have eight quick response teams within our area who will be patrolling on bikes. If any resident is found bursting crackers, we will stop them ourselves; if they do not listen to us, then police officials will be informed.”Mahesh Kumar, the president of DLF City Phase-3 residents’ body, said, “In the whole of DLF-3, there are 14 quick response teams, seven each for day and night. Along with them, a supervisor will also be on rounds. All residents are already sensitised about impacts of the bursting of crackers and are supporting us, but still, the teams will be patrolling to ensure that it is stopped completely.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/air-quality-hits-very-poor-level-a-day-before-diwali-101635957183594.html
03-11-2021||Gurugram||500kg consignment of firecrackers seized from truck, two arrested||Two persons, including a truck driver, were arrested for allegedly smuggling over 500 kilograms of firecrackers into the city from Rajasthan, the police said on Wednesday, marking the first major seizure of firecrackers ahead of Diwali given a blanket ban in the region.The police said that the suspects planned to deliver the firecrackers to different locations across Delhi but were intercepted before crossing the border.Acting on a tip-off, the crime investigation unit (CIA) of Sector 10, found the truck parked outside a godown in Shivaji Nagar. Although it contained groceries at the first glance, crackers were found stuffed in sacks under the eatables, the police said. The truck driver and the co-driver were arrested from the spot.Preet Pal Sagwan, the assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that the consignment was to be delivered to dealers in five locations in Delhi, but the same was seized before they could exit Gurugram. “Sale of crackers was banned in the district and people were smuggling crackers from other districts and states to sell on Diwali in Delhi-NCR,” he said.The Gurugram administration banned the bursting of crackers after the state issued orders in this regard on Monday.The police said they have arrested at least 25 people in the last week who were allegedly selling firecrackers in the markets and residential areas.Sangwan said that in this instance, it was unclear whether the supplier of the firecrackers held a valid licence to sell such items, as it was from another state. “We will ask the supplier to join the investigation if required, “ he said.A case was registered under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code and sections 9B (1b ) and 3 of the Indian Explosive Act at Shivaji Nagar police station.On September 15, the Delhi government first announced a blanket ban on the sale, storage and use of firecrackers this Diwali. The pre-emptive ban was imposed because of the city’s deteriorating air quality over the past three years. In a separate order, the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) later extended the ban till January 1, 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/500kg-consignment-of-firecrackers-seized-from-truck-two-arrested-101635957181847.html
03-11-2021||Gurugram||MCG: Dues of ₹3.41 crore yet to be collected since 2017||At least 8,938 penalties issued by the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) since October 2017, amounting to around ₹3.41 crore, for various offences continue to remain unpaid and unaccounted for, officials said. These account for more than 85% of all challans issued by the MCG in the past four years, they said.MCG officials have now directed their staff to launch a drive from next week to start recovering dues for violations, which range from the operation of illegal meat shops, burning garbage and erecting illegal advertisements to water wastage. Officials said that the water and sewerage connection of violators will be discontinued if they fail to pay the fines.Four years ago, the MCG’s challan system came under scrutiny, as officials started receiving complaints that the civic body staff was collecting fines for violations of the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) without issuing receipts or challans for the same. To overcome the discrepancies, the MCG introduced a new policy wherein on-the-spot payments could no longer be taken by officials. Instead, the officials concerned were directed to note the mobile numbers and addresses of the violators, and the payment could only be made at MCG offices. However, in at least 85% of the cases since then, the violators have either given incorrect addresses or mobile phone numbers or have simply not turned up at the MCG offices to make the payments, with officials also failing to follow up on the matter. The matter came to light last week when deputy municipal commissioner Vijaypal Yadav held a review meeting regarding pending dues. “The non-collection of challans is a serious matter. People would stop taking the MCG seriously. From next week, the MCG will be launching a drive to recover dues from defaulters,” Yadav said.Yadav said that he has directed officials to focus on violators who owe the civic body most or those with a high number of violations.“The staff has been directed to compile a list of violators who each owe the MCG more than ₹5,000 in dues. We will first concentrate on people with heavy dues and then take action against the rest,” said Yadav. Yadav said that the MCG is anticipating people with even smaller dues to pay the fines as word of disconnecting water and sewerage services spreads.According to an official MCG document that has the breakdown of 19 types of challans and the corresponding pending dues, maximum unpaid violations are for pasting illegal advertisements, with payments for 1,848 violations yet to be made. Similarly, fines for 932 violations pertaining to polythene use and 863 violations of illegal meat shops are pending.“With on-the-spot recoveries abolished, there was little incentive for MCG officials to recover the dues. Most fines issued were of ₹500. The civic body would have spent more trying to trace an individual defaulter and getting him or her to pay the amount, hence, there was rarely any follow-up on part of officials and more than 85% fines have remained unaccounted for,” said a senior MCG official who attended last week’s review meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-dues-of-3-41-crore-yet-to-be-collected-since-2017-101635957180485.html
03-11-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram crime: Two snatchers suspected of 100 robberies held||The police on Tuesday arrested two snatchers who had allegedly targeted over 100 people since the start of the festive season last month, making off with over 50 gold chains and over 55 smartphones from South City, Sohna Road, Sector 14, Sector 56 and Golf course Road. The police said the suspects are repeat offenders and were part of a gang, six members of which were arrested and released on bail on October 10. The suspects were identified as Prem Sagar alias Yuvi, a resident of Chapra in Bihar, and Vikram Singh alias Vicky, of Kapashera in Delhi. The police recovered one scooter, at least 10 mobile phones and 10 gold chains from their possession. Preet Pal Sangwan, the assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that there are over 50 snatching gangs currently active in residential areas and that they engage in more crimes during the festival season due to the increased number of pedestrians on roads, especially near markets. “Three women were injured in South City -2, Sector 14 and Sector 56 after they (robbers) snatched their gold chains and dragged them for a few metres,” he said. Sangwan said there are 220 cases registered against unidentified snatchers and that the two of them account for at least 50 cases. “During questioning, suspects revealed that they used to conduct reconnaissance of the area and used to practise driving through congested lanes. Last Diwali also, they had snatched over 50 gold chains and mobile phones but were caught later, around Holi,” he said. The police said these suspects used to sell the gold chains to local goldsmiths for half the price and sold mobile phones in Delhi at throwaway prices. The police have identified the shopkeepers and are trying to trace them as most of them have given them the slip due to an increase in crackdowns.

03-11-2021||Patna||Remand home inmate dies, mob attacks police||A mob on Wednesday attacked police and damaged CCTV cameras in protest against the death of a boy lodged at the remand home for juveniles at Gaighat in Patna City.The remand home’s superintendent, Ajay Kumar, said, “A month ago, the boy was lodged here in connection with an Arms Act case. On Tuesday evening,four inmates were being released. The boy in question also came out of the gate and tried to escape after pushing police forces deputed at the gate. During the escape, he fainted and fell down on the ground. We took him to Nalanda Medical College and Hospital, where he died. The incident was recorded in CCTV camera at the gate.” After the incident, a mob laid siege to the remand home and attacked police force and damaged the CCTV footage. Some policemen were also injured in the incident, Kumar said. The boy’s father, Jitendra Kumar, said his son was fine on Tuesday morning, when he spoke to him. “But he complained about being assaulted by some inmates. I came to know about the incident around 8 pm on Tuesday evening. When I came to the NMCH, I saw my son had head injuries and was bleeding coming from the neck. He was dead by then,” he said.Child activist Krishna Deo Mishra, a former member of juvenile justice board, alleged gross negligence on the part of the remand home administration. “How it is possible that the inmate tried to escape in the presence of tight security? This is not the first incident. On October 6, an inmate had escaped from the home. Strong action should be taken against the officials concerned in this regard,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/remand-home-inmate-dies-mob-attacks-police-101635956939882.html

The boys had allegedly watched episodes of “CID”, a famous Hindi language true-crime television series, and drawn inspiration from it, according to a statement issued by the Pune police.The victim has been identified as Shalini Baban Sonawane (70), a resident of Sayali Heights in Hingane Khurd area of Pune. She was found dead in her living room on the night of October 30.The apprehended minor boys are 16 and 14 years of age. While investigating the case, policeman Ujjav Mokashi learned from a bunch of local children that on the afternoon of October 30, two of their friends had retraced their steps in a hurry on the way to eat paani-puri.“The footage (CCTV) of the two walking in a hurry towards their home added to the suspicion and based on it they were taken into confidence and questioned. The two kept a straight face and started replying rudely. One of them was known to be habitual of stealing from his own house. After more time under questioning, the two broke down and confessed to having killed the woman,” read the statement by senior police inspector Devidas Gheware of Sinhagad road police station.The two had plotted a theft two months in advance and had stolen the key to the woman’s house for it.

03-11-2021||Patna||Patna, Muzaffarpur record ‘poor’ air quality before Diwali||The capital city Patna and Muzaffarpur recorded ‘poor’ air quality while Gaya recorded ‘moderate’ air quality on Wednesday, a day before Diwali.Health experts believed this Diwali is particularly sensitive in terms of air pollution as those who have recovered from Covid-19 are prone to lungs and respiratory illness, if they inhale toxic smoke.As per the bulletin issued by the Central Pollution Control Board, the overall air quality index (AQI) of Patna, based on five monitoring stations across the city, stood at 239 which was classified as poorOf the five air monitoring stations in Patna, Rajbanshi Nagar, Samanpura and Shikarpur-based stations, which recorded ‘poor’ air quality with an index value of 273, 277 and 228 respectively. Two stations at Samanpura and Danapur recorded ‘moderate’ AQI where the index value stood around 200.Similarly, the overall AQI of Muzaffarpur stood at 244 which marked ‘poor’ air quality while Gaya recorded ‘satisfactory’ air quality with a 71 index value.Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) has imposed a complete ban on bursting firecrackers in four cities including Patna, Muzaffarpur, Gaya and Vaishali.BSPCB’s chairman Ashok Ghosh appealed to the residents to avoid bursting firecrackers given public health safety.“We need to be sensitive and careful this Diwali as toxic pollutants may put Covid-19 recovered people at high health risk and respiratory distress”, he emphasised. He said, “Diwali is a festival of lights, not firecrackers. The majority of crackers are manufactured using heavy metals like arsenic, barium, cadmium, nickel and tin which emit hazardous smoke harmful to the lungs. Loud crackers produce high decibel noise which is harmful to the ears over a long exposure.”Ghosh said the board also carried out an awareness drive at schools and public places for sensitizing children and the public for not bursting firecrackers. Last year, Patna recorded ‘moderate’ air quality on pre-Diwali day with an index value of 190.City-based pulmonologist Dr Vikas Kumar, said, “Covid-19 recovered people and patients suffering from respiratory ailment are at high risk if they come in contact with toxic smoke. During fireworks, they should stay indoors and wear face masks for avoiding contact with hazardous pollutants. Long exposure to loud noise and toxicants may cause breathlessness, severe headache and high heart rate.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/patna-muzaffarpur-record-poor-air-quality-before-diwali-101635956460133.html
03-11-2021||Patna||Firecracker ban order goes up in smoke this Diwali||People continued to use firecrackers on the eve of Diwali Wednesday, despite the Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB)’s blanket ban on their sale and use in four cities of Bihar. The BSPCB notified the ban last month in Patna, Gaya, Muzaffarpur and Hajipur, in light of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) order that put an embargo on the sale and use of firecrackers in cities where the average air quality index (AQI) was poor, very poor and severe, as per the assessment in November 2019. Patna, Gaya, Muzaffarpur and Hajipur came under the ambit of the BSPCB ban as they were the only four cities in Bihar then that had air quality monitoring stations, and their AQI was either poor (151 or higher), very poor or severe. Green firecrackers are, however, permitted in other cities, having AQI level better than “poor”, said a BSPCB officer. “Since ours is a regulatory body and not the enforcing agency, we inform the district administration about any violation of our orders and request it to take action. The Supreme Court has made the superintendent of police and station house officer of the police station concerned, responsible for any violation of its order,” said the officer quoted above, when asked about the violation of its ban order in the state. Meanwhile, BSPCB personnel have fanned out across the state to collect samples of firecrackers and check if they conform to the “green cracker” norms, prescribed by the Supreme Court (SC). Green crackers are the invention of the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) and they are similar to traditional firecrackers from sound to appearance, but when they burn, they produce up to 50% less harmful gases. The BSPCB action follows complaints that normal firecrackers were being sold under the garb of “green firecrackers”, said a BSPCB officer, refusing to be identified. “We have instructed our regional offices in Patna, Gaya, Muzaffarpur, Barauni and Purnia to collect samples of firecrackers. We shall send them for test to laboratories approved by the Central Pollution Control Board outside the state. Outlets selling green firecrackers, not conforming to norms, will be penalised,” said Prof Ashok Kumar Ghosh, chairman, BSPCB. As per specifications for green firecrackers, they should not contain barium nitrate and potassium nitrate and should be less in size, ash content and explosive raw materials, as compared to normal firecrackers. They are also supposed to carry Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR)-NEERI marking on them, another officer said. Four teams, comprising three members each, have been constituted in Patna, while separate teams have been constituted at the five regional offices of the BSPCB to monitor ambient air quality and noise level during Diwali. “The need for separate teams to monitor AQI level for 15 days — seven days before and seven days after the Diwali festival on November 4 — in addition to our continuous air quality monitoring stations at 11 locations, was felt because the sensors of our air quality monitoring stations do not detect the presence of heavy metals, which cause severe respiratory distress,” said Prof Ghosh. “The use of heavy metals, including strontium, lead, arsenic, cadmium, tin, barium and zinc, in firecrackers is likely to cause severe respiratory distress in Covid-19 patients or those who are gradually recovering from it, necessitating the ban,” added Prof Ghosh. The NGT had also directed that the licence for the sale of firecrackers be also cancelled in cities having poor AQI and the district administration should ensure effective implementation of the ban||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/firecracker-ban-order-goes-up-in-smoke-this-diwali-101635956290654.html

03-11-2021||Mumbai||Speed up vaccination drive, Modi tells Aurangabad district||Prime Minister Narendra Modi directed the Aurangabad administration to speed up the Covid-19 vaccination drive during an interaction with collectors of over 40 districts across the country where the inoculation drive is slow. Eight districts in Maharashtra, including Aurangabad, Nandurbar, Buldhana, Hingoli, Nanded, Beed, Amravati and Akola, are lagging behind, with respect to the pace of inoculation drive.In these districts, around 51% to 57% eligible population have been administered the first dose, while the state’s overall average is 73.7%. As of November 2, Maharashtra had administered 98,793,874 doses, of which 67,533,015 people have got one dose. Of the target population of 91.44 million, the state has inoculated just 67.52 million people till Tuesday. 31.25 million people in the state have been fully vaccinated. On Wednesday, Modi interacted with district collectors of over 40 districts in Jharkhand, Manipur, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Maharashtra, Meghalaya, among other states with districts having low vaccination coverage.Aurangabad district collector Sunil Chavan gave a presentation on the best practices followed by the district to boost the vaccination numbers. According to Chavan, the prime minister appealed to him to boost the immunisation rate of the district, which currently stood at 55.12%, as Aurangabad is a tourist district.While Mumbai, Pune, Bhandara and Sindhdurga lead the vaccination drive with percentage of first dose inoculation ranging between 89 and 99%, few districts like Nandurbar, Akola, Beed, Buldhana and Amravati lag much behind with the percentage hovering between 51 and 55% for the first dose. Of the 98.53 million doses administered so far, nearly 45% are in Mumbai, Pune, Thane, Nahsik and Nagpur. Thackeray took a review of the vaccination on Tuesday and appealed to the citizens to come forward and vaccinate themselves. “Vaccination tends to prevent infection and also blunts the effects of virus. Citizens should take both the doses,” said Thackeray. He asserted that citizens need to adopt to Covid-19 appropriate behaviour even though the cases may be decreasing. “Even though the cases have been coming down, still the Covid-19 threat still exist and we cannot let our guard down,” said Thackeray.Thackeray on Monday said that in wake of the drop in cases, the people are not coming forward for the vaccination. He has also directed the machinery to take up special drives for the vaccination.As part of interacting with the districts having low vaccination rate, Modi made the appeal to expedite the inoculation drive and vaccinate the population at the earliest while virtually addressing Aurangabad collector, in the presence of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray.“The prime minister heard the presentation and directed us to ramp up the vaccination drive as Aurangabad is a tourist district. From this week, we will implement a drive allowing vaccinated people at the tourist spots [in the district]. Besides that, I presented the reasons for the low immunisation numbers. The reasons include vaccine hesitancy, heavy rainfall and floods in the district, etc,” Chavan told HT. The collector added that he apprised Modi about the ongoing immunisation initiatives in the district including ‘Mission Kavach Kundal’, and ‘Mann Me Hai Vishwas’, which is being implemented in the district. “The vaccination has been increased by implementing the ‘Mission Kavach Kundal Abhiyan’ under the guidance of the chief minister. Similarly, ‘Mann Mein Hai Vishwas,’ a campaign involving religious leaders of all communities, has also helped increase the numbers,” Chavan said.He added that the district administration will take up initiatives at micro level including ‘Mera Ward One Hundred Per cent Vaccination Ward’ and a drive involving children to ask their parents to get vaccinated.According to the data of the state health department, the overall average for first dose is 73.7%, 22 districts of the 35 districts in Maharashtra are below the state’s average. In terms of the second dose, 34.06% of the eligible population are fully vaccinated, while 23 districts are below the overall state average for double doses.Chief minister Thackeray took stock of the vaccination drive in the state on Tuesday and had directed officials to administer at least one dose to all the eligible population by November 30, 2021. A senior bureaucrat said that the CM has directed district administrations to step up the initiatives including more information, education and communication (IEC) drives, involving religious and community leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/speed-up-vaccination-drive-modi-tells-aurangabad-district-101635955560551.html

Prices of cracker have also increased due to shortage of supply and many companies have started manufacturing green crackers.Despite a ban imposed by the state government, a variety of traditional crackers were available at the markets in the absence of enforcement by police and administration.Temporary cracker markets have been established at six locations in the city including the grain market near Jalandhar Bypass, Model Town Extension, Dugri Phase 2 near Dugri police station, GLADA ground on Chandigarh Road, Chaara Mandi on Hambran Road and the ground near Lodhi Club.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-heavy-rush-at-cracker-markets-ahead-of-diwali-101635955383630.html
03-11-2021||Lucknow||Syed Mushtaq Ali Twenty20 Trophy: Former champions Uttar Pradesh look to turn over a new leaf||A new captain, new coach and a new domestic season — it all sums up the trajectory of former champions Uttar Pradesh as they begin their campaign in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Twenty20 Trophy with their Elite Group E match against Chandigarh in Gurugram on Thursday. Ghaziabad’s Karan Sharma, who was the highest run-getter for the side with 168 runs in five matches last season, has been elevated as captain from vice-captain last season when the team couldn’t make it to the knockout rounds. Former Team India star Suresh Raina was the second batter to cross the 100-run mark last season for UP, whereas 17 others could not make an impression. Left-arm pacer Mohsin Khan was the highest wicket-taker for UP with five wickets. Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Shanu Saini had four and three wickets, respectively then. In the new season, both the captain and newly appointed coach Vijay Dahiya will have their task cut out for them. Uttar Pradesh have been drafted into the Elite Group E along with Hyderabad, Uttarakhand, Saurashtra, Delhi and Chandigarh. Besides playing against Chandigarh on Thursday, at the Gurugram Cricket Ground, UP will take on Saurashtra on the following day on November 5. This will be followed by their next match against Delhi on November 6, against Uttarakhand on November 8. After a day’s rest, UP will round off their league campaign in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Twenty20 Trophy with the match against Hyderabad on November 9. “UP (Uttar Pradesh) has been a wonderful domestic side and I am enjoying my stint with the boys, who are capable enough to turn the table on any given day,” Dahiya was quick to react when asked for his comment ahead of the season opener on Wednesday. “I have worked with so many other teams. The talent here has been fantastic. The guys are quite talented and putting a lot of efforts on the ground,” he said. On his own experience with the Uttar Pradesh side, Vijay Dahiya said that it was an opportunity for him to work with a bunch of talented players. “I was more than keen to get down with the boys. I saw the talent at the Challenger Trophy at Kanpur for first time and I realised that by the time the Ranji Trophy starts next month, the UP team would be somewhere in the reckoning for sure.” Led by the energetic Manan Vohra, hosts Chandigarh, which topped the Plate Group last season, will have the advantage of playing on home surface, and if their key players like Ankit Kaushik, Shivam Bhambri, Sarul Kanwar, Gurinder Singh and Arpit Singh get going, the local side would be a tough nut to crack for Uttar Pradesh. Chandigarh would miss the services of medium-pacer Sandeep Sharma, who shifted from Punjab Cricket Association to UTCA this season, and is down with dengue. But the side will also have the advantage of having the services of former Ranji Trophy cricketer from Himachal Pradesh, Rajeev Nayyar, as the team’s coach.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/syed-mushtaq-ali-twenty20-trophy-former-champions-uttar-pradesh-look-to-turn-over-a-new-leaf-101635955379770.html

03-11-2021||Mumbai||Dharavi had six zero-case days in October: BMC data||Dharavi, among India’s largest slum pockets and one of the country’s worst-affected communities during the first Covid-19 wave in 2020, recorded no new case for six days and just one fresh case each on 13 days of October, logging only 50 cases for the month, down from 66 cases in September, according to BMC data. The six zero-case days in October were on the 4th, 11th, 13th, 22nd, 25th and 31st. September had five zero-case days. Dharavi, with an estimated population of 850,000 spread over 2.4 sq km, has recorded 7150 Covid-19 cases since March 2020, and has 20 active cases until Wednesday, November 3. The highest single-day spike in October was seven on October 8. Neighbouring Dadar recorded over 200 Covid-19 cases in October, with Mahim reporting over 130 cases. Dadar’s total caseload is 10,382 with 83 active cases, while Mahim has seen 10,695 cases and has 85 active cases. In April and May 2020, when Dharavi became one of Mumbai’s first containment zones, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) rolled out Mission Dharavi to contain the spread of the infection. This included large-scale testing and contact tracing using fever camps, door-to-door campaigns, and mobile testing vans. As social distancing and home quarantine was literally impossible in Dharavi (the population density here is 354,167 people per sq km, the civic body began institutional quarantine of high risk contacts as well, apart from positive patients. Community toilets were cleaned and sanitised three to four times a day and food packets were distributed to homes as markets and shops were asked to shut down. As a result, June 2020 saw a decline in Covid-19 cases in the area. However, cases began to rise again in April 2021, coinciding with the second wave when it recorded 1460 cases. However, cases dropped to 349 in May, 70 in June, 77 in July, 47 in August, 66 in September, and 50 in October. Kiran Dighavkar, assistant commissioner of the G/North ward with jurisdiction over Dharavi, said, “During the second wave, Dharavi recorded a new spike, and we channelled efforts to contain the spread, like restarting mobile fever camps, ramped up testing and contact tracing. Other efforts were on-going, but we did not need a strict lockdown. We have been focusing on vaccination.” At present, municipal dispensaries and a few health posts provide free testing for Dharavi’s residents. BMC roped in NGOs to help with vaccination registrations in February, March and April. India’s vaccination drive began on January 16, 2021. At present, 89,808 eligible Dharavi residents have received their first dose, with 13,322 beneficiaries being fully vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/dharavi-had-six-zero-case-days-in-october-bmc-data-101635954480074.html

The men then tried to mislead the police by planting goat meat in a gunny bag with an alleged aim to discredit the police investigation, according to Krishna Prakash, commissioner of Pimpri-Chinchwad police.The deceased man has been identified as Bharat alias Bhushan Chorge (27), while the arrested men were identified as Lankesh alias Lankya Sadashiv Rajput, Arun alias Golya Kailas Rajput, both residents of Krushna Complex in Bavdhan and Sachin Tanaji Rajput, a resident of Kasaramboli in Mulshi area of Pimpri Chinchwad. The Rajputs own an illegal hooch production unit and have previous cases related to it against them. “Chorge was having an affair with Lankesh Rajput’s wife. He used to give her two missed calls when he was near her home and they would meet. On the night of October 21, the woman’s husband caught her when Chorge gave missed calls and started beating her. She ran away but Chorge reached the vicinity of their house. Rajput called his relatives and kidnapped him,” said Prakash.Chorge’s mother approached the police on October 22, a day after he went missing from their house, and a case of a missing person was registered. The police started searching for the man and learned that Chorge and Rajput had been in a fight on the night Chorge was caught near Rajput’s house.The mother then told the police that she found one of her son’s slippers near Rajput’s house. The police then discovered that the men had kidnapped Chorge, taken him to a flat in a residential building in Bavdhan and cut him to pieces.“They found Sachin Rajput while others were on the run and he told the police that the body was stuffed in two gunny bags which were near a canal in Urawade whereas the body was burning in their hooch factory. Upon testing the body parts, Hinjewadi police station officials’ team found that it was mutton and started conducting searches of Rajput’s hideouts,” said Prakash.“Some bones and a metal rod that was inserted in Chorge’s leg during a previous surgery was found in the furnace. The doctors confirmed it with the number printed on it,” said senior police inspector Balkrushna Sawant of Hinjewadi police station.The men have been arrested in a case under Sections 302, 364, 120(b), 201, and 34 of the Indian Penal Code registered at Hinjewadi police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/man-3-others-in-custody-for-kidnapping-killing-wife-s-lover-in-bavdhan-101635953339716.html

The work will include fixing the Mangalore roof tiles, checking leakages in turrets and attics, waterproofing the main dome structure, and fixing cracks in the heritage pillars of the building.While restoration work has been undertaken on the headquarters building many times in the past, it was always done in parts. A large-scale restoration project for the heritage building was also taken up 10 years ago on many internal and external parts of the building.Six months ago, BMC’s heritage department completed a structural audit of the building and had appointed Chetan Raikar, a heritage conservationist, for the task of restoration.Following the structural audit report, the heritage department had identified certain works for the building ‘suo-moto’ and drafted a comprehensive restoration plan for the building. The cost of the project is estimated to be ₹15 crore.The BMC building is a two-storey structure. However, above the second floor, as is accessible for staff, officers and visitors from public staircases and elevators, there is an attic level in some parts of the building, that is mainly used for storage or is lying vacant. The Mangalore roof tiles comprise the immediate roof of this attic floor. Over time, gaps and cracks have developed in these roof tiles, leading to rainwater seeping into the attic rooms. Pigeon nets will also be installed on all windows.A senior civic body official associated with the project said, “We don’t want to do patchwork repairs constantly. We want to do comprehensive restoration work so that we don’t have to worry about it for the next twenty five years.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-to-take-up-restoration-work-of-its-headquarter-building-101635952079443.html
03-11-2021||Pune||Two transgender persons in custody for killing man after soliciting, robbing him in Nigdi||PIUNE Two transgender persons were remanded to police custody on Wednesday for killing a labourer by luring him with solicitation into an isolated location in the Kalbhornagar area of Nigdi, according to Krishna Prakash, commissioner of Pimpri-Chinchwad police.The deceased man was identified as Basraj Bhimappa Itkal (38), a plumber labourer living in Chinchwad. The man was separated from his wife in 2010 and lived with his brother and his family in Anandnagar, Chinchwad.The two arrested were identified as Anjali Balu Jadhav (25) and Anita Shivaji Mane (26), both residents of Ekta Colony in Ganesh nagar area of Thergaon, according to the police. The two lured Itkal to the bushes by soliciting and then robbed of ₹4,000, according to the police. The money was also found in their possession.The marks on the neck led the police to believe that it was a murder and upon thorough investigation of the crime scene, the police found used as well as unused condoms on the spot. Two teams were formed under assistant police inspector Korde Amol and police sub-inspector Vijay Pawar and were monitored by assistant commissioner of police Sagar Kawade.“During our investigation, a third person had received an extra-judicial confession from two transgender persons who said that they had solicited a man and had left him unconscious and fled with his money,” said Prakash.The doctors have reserved the confirmed cause of death but they have opined that the death was caused by strangulation, according to Prakash.The man had left his house at 10pm on October 31 after telling his brother that he was visiting their sister. However, the next morning the local police called and informed the family that the man was found unconscious in the open grounds of a private company in Kalbhornagar. He was taken to Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial hospital in Pimpri and was declared dead on arrival.A case under Sections 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) was registered against the two at Nigdi police station and Section 8 of the Immoral Trafficking Prevention Act was added to the case.“In the case, the victim died and the act came to light. But many others who survived their robbery do not want to come forwards. Therefore, henceforth, if anyone is found soliciting, Section 8 of ITPA will be invoked against them,” said Prakash.Livelihood provision for transgendersThe Pimpri-Chinchwad police head has claimed to begin an initiative to help train the willing members of the transgender community with vocational training and help in finding work. However, the ones who are found indulging in solicitation and robbery may be prosecuted, he said.“The problem begins at home with the family. If the family abandons a transgender child, it is a serious crime under Juvenile Justice Act. Whoever is found doing this (handing over a transgender child to transgender adults) will face action. The transgenders who are found taking babies, with or without parents’ consent, will also face action. Furthermore, if the child is found to be sexually exploited, a case under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offence (POCSO) Act will also be registered. Alternatively, soft skills and vocational training courses for willing transgender people will be launched through the corporate social responsibility (CSR) fund,” said Prakash.The transgender community members will then be able to get jobs like plumbing, fitting, electrical fixing, industrial factory work, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/two-transgender-persons-in-custody-for-killing-man-after-soliciting-robbing-him-in-nigdi-101635951779653.html
03-11-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra prepares for 1.2 million active Covid cases in third wave||Maharashtra is preparing for an active Covid-19 caseload of 1.2 million during the peak of the anticipated third wave, according to projections made by the Centre and shared with the state. The projections are based on Maharashtra’s highest active cases recorded during the second wave and district-wise peaks recorded between March and June this year. In addition to strengthening existing jumbo Covid-19 facilities and hospitals, preparations include readying 531 oxygen generation plants and processing tenders to stock up on eight essential medicines used for Covid-19 treatment. The state’s peak active caseload – 698,354 – was recorded on April 25 this year. However, different districts peaked at different times. Considering the variation in the peaks, state officials estimate a peak active caseload of 800,000 and are preparing for a surge 1.5 times that number. “We are preparing for 1.2 million active cases in the third wave,” said N Ramaswami, commissioner, National Health Mission, Maharashtra, a vertical of the union health ministry that works closely with the state. Experts, however, are divided over the nature of the third wave. For instance, virologist Dr T Jacob John of Christian Medical College, Vellore, said in a recent online conference that the worst is over for Maharashtra and a third wave is unlikely. Physician Dr Jalil Parkar of Lilavati Hospital in Bandra said with the vaccinations and caution among people, the third wave will likely be a mild one and it will not stretch the state’s healthcare infrastructure like the first two. “But if the virus mutates to something worse, we don’t know how the wave will be,” said Dr Parkar. Dr Parkar said some doctors anticipate a stronger third wave, perhaps driven by a variant that will attack the unexposed and unvaccinated population such as minors and may be dominated by re-infections and breakthrough (post-vaccination) infections. “But it’s hard to be sure,” said Parkar. “We considered all scenarios and decided to not put any existing plans and preparations on hold. However, we are not encouraging any new projects,” said Ramaswami, adding that, of the 513 oxygen generation plants, 68 were donated by the PM Cares Fund. Of the 68 plants, 65 have already been set up. The state is looking at a 70:20:10 oxygen formula for each district which includes 70% oxygen supply through liquid medical oxygen (LMO) storage tanks, 20% through oxygen generation plants and 10% through other sources such as cylinders. Ramaswami said the state has also placed orders to ensure enough stock of eight medicines commonly used for Covid-19 patients, including repurposed drugs such as Remdesivir and Tocilizumab, steroids, anticoagulants, and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), among others. The state had also made a budgetary provision to procure monoclonal antibodies that have been found effective in patients with mild to moderate symptoms. However, the plan has been put on hold as the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) is yet to include the cocktail therapy in its treatment protocol. Infectious disease expert and state task force member Dr Om Srivastava said that a lot of thought has gone into deriving the projection of active cases. “There will obviously be talk about wastage of resources if the third wave does not occur. But it’s a wise strategy to be prepared for a disaster,” said Srivastava, who believes that a third wave is likely in December. According to Srivastava, based on the current situation, the third wave seems manageable. “But the situation might change. We didn’t anticipate a severe second wave, but it stretched each and every resource,” he said. High-burden cities such as Mumbai and Pune have been asked to stay vigilant and focus on vaccinations as well as strict implementation of Covid-appropriate behaviour. Mumbai, for instance, had the highest active case load of 91,100 on April 11. Going by the state’s formula, Mumbai active cases may peak to 136,000 during the third wave. “We go by the projections made by the state and the Centre,” said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani, who has been managing BMC’s Covid-19 response in Mumbai. “We have kept our jumbo facilities intact, and strengthened them with paediatric beds. We also have created more facilities in the western and eastern suburbs for a worst-case scenario.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-prepares-for-1-2-million-active-covid-cases-in-third-wave-101635950819524.html

03-11-2021||Mumbai||Suicide case: BJP demands resignation of Maharashtra minister||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has demanded the resignation of soil and water conservation minister Shankarrao Gadakh after his name cropped up in a suicide case of an employee associated with an educational institute headed by the brother of the minister. The BJP said that the youth who died was a personal assistant of the minister and he has held the minister and his two relatives responsible in an audio and video message recorded before he died by suicide. Gadakh has refuted the allegations, saying he was not his PA and he had no direct association with the person who died. He said he was ready to face any punishment if found guilty. “Of the 10 people named by the victim, seven have been booked, except three members from Gadakh family . There is a lot of pressure on police to not take any action against the minister and his family members. For a fair investigation into the suicide case, the minister either should resign or he should be sacked by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray,” said Keshav Upadhye, state BJP spokesperson. Upadhye said that the minister, his wife and brother have been named in audio and video messages. “He was being tortured and was forced to suicide. The investigation of Gadakhs is important to ensure justice to the deceased youth. Nothing has been done in last six days. If the local police failed to book minister and his family members, we will demand the investigation by Central Bureau of Investigation,” he said. Gadakh said that he has nothing to with the case and he was ready to face any inquiry. “Why only resignation as minister, I am ready to be hanged if I have done anything wrong. He was not my PA, but was working as computer operator at Yashavantrao Chavan dental college headed by my brother Prashan Gadakh. I have nothing to do with the person deceased. Police has started investigation and have arrested four of the seven accused. There is no question of me putting any pressure on the police. In fact I am requesting the police to take out all call records of the person died and mine to check if we have any association. I do not know why he has named me and my family members in the audio,” he said. In a video, the victim’s sister said that minister and his family has nothing to do with the case. “After recording the video on October 28, he had told me that he named minister and his family member in the spur of the moment and under the influence of liquor. We have no complaint against the Gadakhs and we are not under any pressure. We want the other seven accused to get punished as they had made my brother’s life miserable. They would threat him at gun point and ask to leave Maharashtra,” she has said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/suicide-case-bjp-demands-resignation-of-maharashtra-minister-101635950639555.html

03-11-2021||Lucknow||Pandemic takes the wind out of ‘patangbazi’ in Lucknow||LUCKNOW Amarnath Kaul and his friend Aamir Hussain, both in their sixties and residents of Old City, are preparing for the battle in the skies on Jamghat – the kite-flying festival the day after Diwali. But they are less enthusiastic this year as Covid has cast its shadow over the traditional ‘patangbazi’ in the city with no major competitions slotted for the day.“Due to corona, there will be no major competitions this year. But several private competitions will be organised either on the rooftops or away from the city limits,” said Kaul, patron of District Kite Clubs Association and eight-time national kite-tangling champion.He said, “The sale of kites, manjha and saddi has dropped considerably this year as compared to the pre-Covid era. Against the usual sale of around 4 lakh kites during Diwali, only 30% sale has been recorded due to the pandemic, rising prices of kites and cash crunch among the middle class.”Before the pandemic, over 95 lakh kites were sold annually in Lucknow, out of which 15 lakh were consumed by kite clubs of Lucknow, said kite makers. Om Prakash Agarwal, 65, of Channa Kite centre said, “I have been into the business of kite making for 45 years but never saw the sales dipping like this. Customers, who used to purchase 100 kites, are giving orders for 30-40 now. Another reason for low sales is the absence of any tournament by the kite clubs. There are around 80 registered and over 300 unregistered kite clubs, having around 21,000 members who used to assemble at various places for kite tangling. But this has not happened for the last two years due to the pandemic.”Kite making is a highly skilled job, but kite makers earn less than unskilled labour. The government must come out with a package for helping this business,” said Guru Dutt, 46, of Guddu Kite Centre in Chaupatian.However, Sanjeev Srivastava of Indira Nagar, who was there to purchase kites from Doctor Kite house in Hussaingaj, said: “Both my daughters and other family members are fond of kite flying. But this year, I have purchased only 22 kites against 60 to 70 kites in the past.”He added, “The prices of kites have increased and income has also reduced due to the pandemic.”“The tradition of kite flying on Jamghat was started by Nawab Asafuddaula for maintaining close relationship between Hindus and Muslims during his tenure. The Nawabs of Lucknow knew that the two communities will have to remain together forever and they require some common festivals. So they chose Jamghat in which Hindus and Muslims participated with similar enthusiasm, This bonhomie between the two communities has continued since then,” said Shobha Mishra, head of department, Navyug PG College.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/pandemic-takes-the-wind-out-of-patangbazi-in-lucknow-101635949499346.html
03-11-2021||Pune||Former sarpanch in police net in cheating case; 20 luxury cars recovered||A former sarpanch of a village in Khed was arrested and remanded to police custody for cheating over 200 people by taking their cars and mortgaging them further to people in different districts. The man cheated not only the owner but also the person he mortgaged the cars to, according to Krishna Prakash, commissioner of Pimpri Chinchwad police.The arrested man has been identified as Sagar Mohan Sable (34), a resident of Sabelwadi in Khed. He landed on the police radar when a man complained against him for cheating him out of the ownership of his car after he failed to return the car.A case for cheating and criminal breach of trust was registered at Bhosari police station.A team led by police sub-inspector Prashant Sable changed their looks and pretended to be locals in Beed in order to arrest Sable.He has cheated 200-250 people by taking their cars after telling them that he has good connections with industrial companies and that he could get them good rent money. He took possession of the cars through a notarised process. He then took the cars to agents and told them that I’ll give you these cars for heavily subsidised rates. The agents further mortgaged the cars to other people and falsely told them that the cars belong to people who are now economically weak and cannot pay their debts.“He would tell the people in other districts that they can use the car for a low price until the original owner pays their debt. In rural areas, high debt is generally considered as a lost cause after a while. Under this assumption, the people would pay for the cars,” said Prakash.The police have recovered 20 cars worth ₹1,96,00,000, according to the officials. However, over the past multiple years, the man has misused 50-55 cars from Khed, 20 from Baramati and Daund, 70 from Pimpri-Chinchwad, and 70 others from other places in the state.“The former sarpanch does not have any previous cases but he does have two accomplice agents who will also be arrested. He is in police custody for five days. It is people’s fault too for trusting that the cars will be available at such a low price,” said Prakash.The police are in the process of recovering other cars which were sold in the same way. The two agents are also on the police radar along with others who may have helped him mortgage the cars.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/former-sarpanch-in-police-net-in-cheating-case-20-luxury-cars-recovered-101635949439298.html
03-11-2021||Pune||Winter likely to be normal this season: IMD||PUNE The India Meteorological Department (IMD) officials have forecasted that winter will be close to normal or below normal minimum temperatures this season. A detailed forecast, officials from the weather department, will be issued by the end of November, giving more clarity on how winter will be this season.Dr Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director general of IMD, said that a detailed forecast for winter will be issued by November-end.“We give a detailed forecast for the winter season, that is December, January and February by November-end. Multiple factors affect the winter temperature,” said Dr Mohapatra.He added that the chill in the southern part of the country is due to snowfall in the north.“There was a western disturbance in the north by October end which led to snowfall in the northern part of India. This has led the cooler winds to travel to the southern part of India thus reducing the night temperature,” said Dr Mohapatra.Weather scientists note that La Nina is one of the components for cooler than normal temperatures during the winter. La Nina is also a major associated with above-normal rainfall during monsoon.As per the long-range forecast for November, at present La Niña conditions are prevailing over the Equatorial Pacific Ocean and neutral Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) conditions are prevailing over the Indian Ocean.“The latest global model forecasts indicate that the La Niña conditions are likely to prevail until March 2022 and neutral IOD conditions are likely to continue during the upcoming seasons,” said IMD officials.Speaking about the impact of La Nina on winter, Dr DS Pai, who heads climate research and services at IMD, Pune said that multiple factors affect winter.“Along with La Nina, there are other factors that affect the temperature in winter. All these factors and the detailed forecast will be issued on November end by IMD,” said Pai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/winter-likely-to-be-normal-this-season-imd-101635949079188.html

Earlier last week, 50-60 Covid cases were recorded daily within the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) limits. However, the testing has reduced to 800-1,000 tests per day, compared to 2,000-2,500 tests last month. Dr Pratibha Panpatil, epidemic officer, KDMC, said, “The testing has reduced as there has been a decline in the low and high-risk contacts. The positivity rate in KDMC is below 3%. The situation is under control.”On November 1, KDMC recorded 17 cases, which is the lowest; while earlier on April 4, 2020, when the pandemic hit the city, five cases were recorded in KDMC limits. The city reported 33 deaths in October. In September the total number of Covid testing carried out by the KDMC was 95,325 and a total of 1,972 positive cases were recorded, with a positivity rate of 2.06%. In October month, a total of 55,671 tests were carried out, and 1,603 positive cases were recorded. The positivity rate was 2.8%.

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has said that state and civic body-run 145 vaccination centres will remain shut for four days. However, the vaccination drive will continue at 145 private hospitals in the city.In a statement issued on Wednesday, the BMC said, “Vaccination drive at government and municipal centres in Mumbai will be closed for four days from Thursday, November 4 to Sunday, November 7. The vaccination drive will be resumed from Monday, November 8, 2021.”The BMC has, however, maintained that they have sufficient stock of vaccines and the drive is being shut owing to holidays, due to Diwali. The statement of the BMC added, “The BMC has adequate stocks of Covid vaccines. A humble appeal is being made to the citizens of Mumbai to cooperate with the BMC administration.”Further, owing to the festival season in October including Navratri, Dussehra, the vaccination had dipped drastically in October compared to September. HT had reported last week about the significant drop of 39% in inoculation in October, as compared to the previous month’s figures.According to civic body data, between September 1 and 29, over 2.6 million citizens were vaccinated, while the number dropped to 1.6 million until October 29. The data also shows that there has been no shortage of doses, as the civic body received 1.6 million doses in October against 1.7 million doses the previous month. This means that the civic body has surplus vaccine doses in stock.The BMC aims to vaccinate the entire 9.2 million adult eligible population by the end of February 2022. Currently, out of the 9.2 million eligible population, 96% are vaccinated with at least the first dose and 57% are fully vaccinated.

03-11-2021||Lucknow||Will ally with uncle Shivpal’s party, give him full respect: Akhilesh||LUCKNOW Ahead of the 2022 UP Assembly polls, Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav on Wednesday expressed his intent to forge an alliance with his politically estranged uncle Shivpal Yadav’s Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party-Lohia (PSP-L). Shivpal was trying for an alliance with the SP since before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, but Akhilesh had been non-committal.“It has been the endeavour of the Samajwadi Party to stitch an alliance with smaller parties. Naturally, we are going to forge an alliance with the party of uncle Shivpal Singh Yadav as well. The SP will give him full respect,” said Akhilesh in Saifai. He is on a visit to his ancestral village for the family’s usual get-together on Diwali.“Many small parties have joined hands with us. Recently, Om Prakash Rajbhar (president of Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party) held a historic programme in Mau and has allied with the SP,” he added. When asked about any merger of the PSP-L into the SP, Akhilesh said: “Alliance, not merger.”Reacting to chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s statement on Monday that he should apologise for comparing Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel with Pakistan’s founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Akhilesh said: “The BJP engages in the politics of hatred. It is always on the lookout for such chances. They do not talk about unemployment and development.” At an event in Hardoi on Sunday, Akhilesh Yadav took the name of the Father of the Nation Mahatama Gandhi, the first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Deputy Prime Minister Sardar Patel and the founder of Pakistan Mohammad Ali Jinnah in the same breath for working for India’s freedom. Since then, the BJP had been attacking Akhilesh over the comment.On chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s proposed visit to Etawah on November 6, he said: “Maybe he (Yogi Adityanath) is visiting Etawah to inaugurate some of the works that our government had done. He does not have any work of his to showcase. When he comes here, ask him what significant work he did.”Shivpal and Akhilesh Yadav had fallen out in August 2016, triggering a long drawn Yadav family feud for the control of the Samajwadi Party. Eventually, Akhilesh became the national president of SP in January 2017 and Shivpal eventually floated the PSP-L before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. He contested against SP’s official candidate and the then sitting MP Akshay Yadav from Firozabad. However, both lost as the BJP wrested the seat from the SP. Since the formation of PSP-L, Shivpal had openly talked about his intention to ally with the SP.Deepak Mishra, a PSP-L leader, said: “We had been saying that like-minded socialists should come together. Whenever socialists have come together, they won elections.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/will-ally-with-uncle-shivpal-s-party-give-him-full-respect-akhilesh-101635946259180.html

03-11-2021||Chandigarh||Pose and post, spread festive cheer without fake filters||The festive season is here, and it’s time to bombard our social media accounts with selfies, photos and more photos. After all, festivals are more about pose and post than anything else. Let’s admit it, it’s not just the festivals but for every click, we have that one mechanical smile and pout that makes us look happy for the rest of the world. Pictures and poses are only supposed to be happy and smiling and nothing else. Recently, I came across a photograph shared by an old PhD student of my father. The picture was taken after his viva with the examiner, so it was a joyous moment of PhD completion. It must be a 25-year-old photo with no smiling faces except the very young me and my grinning elder sister. There was a pattern where teachers were sitting in the front, and the students were standing behind. All the young chaps, who must be students and their class friends, were blank and too serious to be clicked. It was like no big deal; imagine completing a PhD today and the emotional pose and posts. Something caught my attention in that picture except my young father. Somehow, we tend to forget our parents were young too as we grow in life. To confirm my suspicion, I browsed through old family albums. Eureka! I was right, no one used to smile for photos and the poses have mostly the same pattern. The first picture I saw was my grandparent’s family photo. Dadaji was sitting on a chair with my Dadi with one child in her lap, the rest of the four children standing in shorts and staring straight at the camera with no smiles. My maternal grandparents had a similar family picture where everyone was serious. Next was my parents’ wedding album. Not in a single photo was my mother smiling, not even in her weird, shy bride poses! My father looked too serious to be getting married. My curious mind browsed childhood birthday pictures with a cap and a prominent safety pin holding a hanky in the front of my red frill frock. Of course, I was not interested in looking up or smiling but just staring at the cake and even crying in some pictures; phew! Today, my four-year-old nephew poses so well for any photo and chooses his clothes for birthdays. Looking at uncountable and unreasonable selfies and videos today, I wonder, have we rediscovered the art of smiling? No matter how shattered our lives and how much pain we are in, no one will post a picture without a big smile and a philosophical caption. A photograph today is no longer a memory. The camera doesn’t have a limitation of 36 shots. Photos were special memories at that time. They lacked the smile but had authenticity and reality without any fake filters to make it look beautiful. Technology has given us so much, but somehow it has also taken away the special occasion feel, worthy enough to be preserved and captured. The lonely selfies and fake smiles and the quest to showcase your best on social media have taken over family gatherings, the real feel and memoirs of a life well lived not just well captured. mudita.srvstv@gmail.com The writer is a Mohali-based communication professional||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pose-and-post-spread-festive-cheer-without-fake-filters-101635945058903.html

He also made a forecast that the wind speed will pick up on November 6 and 7.Meanwhile, the Centre-run System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR) showed that the overall Air Quality Index (AQI) of Delhi reached the ‘very poor’ category on Wednesday. The concentrations of PM 2.5 and PM 10 stood at 252 in the ‘poor’ and 131 in the ‘very poor’ category, respectively, as reported by ANI.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate', 201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal took to Twitter to post the air quality data for the national capital, which remained in ‘very poor’ category.Earlier in the day, Delhi's environment minister Gopal Rai said bursting firecrackers is “not a matter of religion" as it affects people's lives and urged the opposition parties not to jeopardise the wellbeing of children and the elderly for political ambitions.He also appealed to the Centre to issue an advisory to Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to mandatorily stop stubble burning during the Diwali period, news agency PTI reported.The Delhi government on Monday told the high court that it will not allow any firecrackers, including ‘green crackers’, to be sold and used in the Capital in wake of Covid-19 pandemic and the deteriorating air quality.At a press conference, Rai alleged that some people of opposition parties are trying to sabotage the AAP government's fight against pollution by linking firecracker bursting to religion."Bursting of firecrackers is not a matter of religion. It is a matter of people's lives. Some people want to fulfil their political ambitions... I appeal to them with folded hands to not play with the lives of Delhi's children and the elderly."There are many other issues for politics. Please let people breathe. Diwali means diyas (lamps) not firecrackers," he said.Rai said Delhi's air quality a day before Diwali was the best in five years. "Favourable weather conditions and people's support to the government's anti-pollution campaign are reasons for best October air quality in five years," he said."I also urge the Centre to issue a mandatory advisory to Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to stop burning stubble at least during the Diwali period so that people can breathe easy after the festival," the minister said.He said more than 13,000 kg of illegal firecrackers have been seized and 33 people arrested under the anti-cracker campaign.As part of the drive to check dust pollution, a penalty of ₹1.23 lakh has been imposed on 406 construction sites found violating dust control norms.Rai said Pusa bio-decomposer, a microbial solution that can convert stubble into manure in 15 to 20 days, has been sprayed over 1,700 acres of agricultural land in Delhi."The spraying of the bio-decomposer got delayed due to rains in October. The rest of the fields will be covered by November 20," he added.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/imd-warns-of-very-poor-air-quality-in-delhi-in-next-24-hours-101635938365424.html
03-11-2021||Chandigarh||Himachal apple growers upset BJP’s applecart in Jubbal-Kotkhai||The apple-growing belt of Himachal Pradesh has been the epicentre of the hill state’s politics for decades and Tuesday’s byelection verdict that went against the ruling BJP is being seen as a vote against the crash in apple rates this season. Also read: Bypoll results: What they reveal, what they don’tHimachal Pradesh’s apple belt is spread over Shimla, Kinnaur and Kullu besides parts of Mandi and Sirmaur districts, comprising 16 assembly segments. The state’s ₹6,000-crore apple economy has 1.75 lakh families dependent on it. The problems of apple growers were at the centrestage of the campaign in Jubbal-Kotkhai, the home turf of two former chief ministers Thakur Ram Lal and Virbhadra Singh, during this byelection. All three candidates, namely Rohit Thakur of the Congress, Neelam Saraik of the BJP and Chetan Bragta, a BJP rebel-turned-Independent, wove their campaign around the apple economy. The apple growers were upset with the Jai Ram Thakur-led BJP government for the way it handled the market crash this time. State horticulture minister Mahendra Singh Thakur and his colleague Suresh Bhardwaj, who was the BJP campaign in-charge of Jubbal-Kotkhai, infuriated the growers with their statements over the crash. It’s no surprise that the BJP candidate had to forfeit her deposit on Tuesday. Anger boiled over, says Rohit Thakur of Congress “There has been anger among apple growers this time. The BJP government made no effort to give them relief despite adverse weather conditions that hit their crop. They have been ignored for the past three years,” said Congress candidate Rohit Thakur, who wrested the Jubbal-Kotkhai seat from the BJP. “I have 10 months (before the assembly elections). I will try to do whatever is possible. The road conditions are bad in this belt,” he said. Barring Mahender Singh Thakur, the incumbent horticulture minister who belongs to the non-apple growing area of Dharampur, the government has always appointed a horticulture minister from the core apple-growing belt, which has produced some of the foremost leaders of the state, including two former chief ministers Virbhadra Singh and Ram Lal Thakur, besides Vidya Stokes and Satyawati Parmar, the wife of former chief minister Yashwant Parmar. Satyawati was state Congress chief from 1964-69 and she was a Rajya Sabha member. JBL Khachi was another tall leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/himachal-apple-growers-upset-bjp-s-applecart-in-jubbalkotkhai-101635942959991.html
03-11-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: Fire breaks out at spinning mill, no casualties||A major fire broke out at Kaur Sain spinning mills in Phase-8 of Focal Point around 3am on Wednesday. Though no casualty was reported, firefighting operations lasted for over seven hours. Leading fireman Rajinder Singh said the fire seems to have been caused by a short-circuit. “Labourers working in the mill managed to escape on time but material and machinery kept on the first and ground floor were completely gutted. As many as seven fire tenders were pressed into service and these had to be refilled at least 60 times. Water was arranged from a nearby factory and a hospital on the Chandigarh road,” said Singh.The mill staff refused to comment on the estimated loss in the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-fire-breaks-out-at-spinning-mill-no-casualties-101635942899757.html
03-11-2021||Mumbai||After delay in results, undergraduate medical aspirants await AIQ, state quota admission details||After facing weeks of delay to finally get hold of their results, undergraduate (UG) medical and dental aspirants are now worried about the slow pace at which admissions to state quota is underway. While the first round of admissions will have to start for the all-India quota (AIQ) seats, students and parents have highlighted how the state common entrance test (CET) cell has only now started the college registration process, which otherwise is completed before results for the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET-UG) exams are released.“Admissions to the 15% AIQ seats will be conducted by the Medical Counselling Committee (MCC), but admissions to the 85% state quota seats are conducted by state CET cell and as yet, we have no information about seat matrix. The further this process gets delayed, the amount of time we get to pursue our education also gets curtailed,” said a UG medical aspirant. NEET UG results were announced by the National Testing Agency (NTA) on November 1 this year, after weeks of delay due to a stay from the Bombay high court. As per figures shared by NTA, 15.44 lakh students appeared for the NEET-UG exam held in pen-and-paper format across the country on September 12. Of the 15.44 lakh students who appeared for the exam, 8.7 lakh candidates cleared the exam. This includes 3.75 lakh male and 4.94 female candidates and 8 transgender candidates.The state CET cell on November 1 released a circular inviting medical and AYUSH course colleges to complete the registration process. This includes colleges updating college info (if any), updating intake capacity and uploading all necessary permission letters. Following this process, the CET cell then releases a seat matrix and list of registered colleges for students to choose from at the time of filling their registration and choice filling forms.“Both the all-India and state admission rounds are looking lax at present; no brochures or seat matrix has been released. Even a basic circular on online registration for students has not started as yet. Students will end up losing some precious academic time because of all this delay,” said Sudha Shenoy, parent and activist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/after-delay-in-results-undergraduate-medical-aspirants-await-aiq-state-quota-admission-details-101635942539837.html
03-11-2021||Chandigarh||HP BJP’s slogans ring hollow after Pratibha’s win in Mandi||Himachal Pradesh chief minister Jai Ram Thakur pulled out all stops to campaign for party candidate Brigadier Khushal Chand Thakur (retd), who was pitted against Pratibha Singh of the Congress, on his home turf of Mandi but in vain. Also read: Bypoll results: What they reveal, what they don’tThe BJP slogan of “Mandi humari thi, humari hai aur humari rahegi (Mandi is ours and will remain ours)” was countered by Pratibha Singh on social media soon after she was declared victorious. “Mandi hum sab ki hein, hum sabki thi, hum sabki rahegi (Mandi belongs to all of us),” she tweeted after winning the elections. BJP campaigners had described the wife of former chief minister Virbhadra Singh as Majboor Mahila (helpless woman), which she responded with the slogan that she’s a Majboot Mahila (strong woman). Political observers say that the Mandi Lok Sabha byelection win on Tuesday has given a psychological advantage to the opposition Congress not only in Mandi but also in the entire state that will be going to the polls next year-end. Political significance of Mandi Mandi is a central district of the state and representatives of this constituency have vied for the post of chief minister. Karam Singh Thakur, a prominent leader from Mandi, challenged then chief minister Dr Yashwant Singh Parmar’s authority in the early ’60s but could not make it to the CM’s chair. Former Union minister Sukh Ram, close to then prime minister PV Narasimha Rao made several efforts to overthrow Virbhadra Singh to become the chief minister but the scion of the Rampur Bushahr royal family didn’t let the Mandi leader succeed in his mission. It was after a struggle of five decades that Jai Ram Thakur, who hails from Tandi village of Mandi district, fulfilled the aspiration. Jai Ram Thakur was the face of the BJP not only for the Mandi parliamentary seat but for the three assembly segments, too. He tried to strike an emotional chord but it didn’t work as Pratibha defeated Kargil war veteran Brigadier Thakur by 7,490 votes. During the campaign, the BJP camp raked up regional factors to secure votes, while the Congress banked on the sympathy factor following the death of Pratibha’s husband and former CM Virbhadra Singh in July. She accused the BJP of raking up regionalism for electoral gains and chose to focus on the shortcomings in governance. Convincing lead in Seraj Of the 17 assembly segments in Mandi, the BJP was defeated in nine assembly segments. Brigadier Thakur was able to get a convincing 21,659 votes lead from his home constituency of Seraj. The leads from Karsog, Sundernagar, Balh, Mandi and Sarkhaghat were marginal. The BJP got a thin lead of 956 votes from Mandi town, represented by Sukh Ram’s son Anil Sharma. The CM’s ties with Anil are strained after his son Aashray Sharma contested the 2019 Lok Sabha elections on the Congress ticket against the BJP nominee, Ram Swaroop Sharma. Anil, who had joined the BJP on the eve of the 2017 assembly elections, was forced to quit the cabinet. He was sidelined by the party since then and has been lying low. Infighting also cost the BJP dear. Ajay Rana, an aide of former chief minister Prem Kumar Dhumal, and Praveen Sharma, also a Dhumal loyalist who was denied the Vidhan Sabha ticket, were absent from the campaign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hp-bjp-s-slogans-ring-hollow-after-pratibha-s-win-in-mandi-101635942538582.html
03-11-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai court grants pre-arrest bail to four trustees of Mahim temple||Arrest has far reaching consequences, not only to the person arrested but his whole family, the Mumbai sessions court observed, while granting bail to four trustees of Dadoba Jagannath Religious Charitable Trust at Mahim. “Certainly the image of arrested person gets tarnished particularly when the persons like present applicants who are ailing and very old and have not a single criminal antecedent throughout their life,” said additional sessions judge MG Deshpanade, referring to the fact that one of the trustees was aged 91 years and two others were aged 88 and 78 respectively The accused —Jaywant Desai, Padmakar Sahani, Sanjeev Paralkar and Shaila Pathare — had approached the court for anticipatory bail, apprehending arrest in connection with a case registered by Mahim police station. The case is based on complaint lodged by one Prabhakar Thakur, who alleged that the trustees misappropriated some old stone idols from the Heritage II category temple of the trust. He said the trustees changed the old idols, saying those were eroded and despite pursuing long with them, they did not inform him as to where those old idols had gone. Therefore he lodged a complaint on July 5, 2019, with the Mahim police station. The police in turn had requested the office of the charity commissioner to look into the matter. Accordingly, the charity inspector carried out an inquiry and found that the idols of Parvati Mata and Mata Shitaladevi had been kept at Madh, at the farmhouse of the trust chairman, Ganpati Bhatte, and Sanjiv Paralkar had secretly brought them back and kept them in the office behind the temple. Inspection of the idols had revealed that there was no erosion. The FIR alleged that the trustees had misappropriated two more old idols. However, advocates Rajan Shirodkar and Nihar Ghag, who represented the trustees, submitted that the FIR was an outcome of a tenancy dispute between the trust and the complainant, a tenant. Main reason for lodging the complaint was the notice issued by the trust on April 16, 2019 to the informant’s mother for vacating a tenant godown, owned by the trust. The court accepted their contentions. “The conduct of informant prima-facie speaks volumes. In my opinion all that has been agitated is nothing but tenancy dispute given the colour of criminal prosecution,” said the court while granting pre-arrest bail to the trustees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-court-grants-pre-arrest-bail-to-four-trustees-of-mahim-temple-101635940258299.html

They'll decide, and they've decided. Hence I want to thank them for reposing their faith in us,” Kumar said.JD(U) retained both Tarapur and Kusheshwar Asthan assembly seats, defeating the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) candidates. First-time candidates Aman Bhushan Hazari and Rajiv Kumar Singh won by a margin of more than 12,000 votes and 3,800 votes from Tarapur and Kusheshwar Asthan, respectively.Kumar, who was garlanded by party workers in Patna on Wednesday, remarked that the people of Bihar have “given their verdict” by electing both representatives of JD(U).The bypolls were necessitated by the death of the two sitting JD(U) representatives, and a loss to RJD would have further eroded the strength of the party in the ruling coalition it has formed with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) after last year’s assembly elections.RJD supremo Lalu Prasad had campaigned for his party’s candidates in both seats after a hiatus of six years and although his rallies attracted a huge number of people it did not translate into votes for Arun Kumar Sah and Ganesh Bharti, the RJD candidates from Tarapur and Kusheshwar Asthan, respectively.RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav accepted his party’s defeat. “We accept the people’s verdict. The sympathy factor worked at both the places,” he said after the verdict was announced. His brother Tej Pratap Yadav, however, lashed out at state president Jagadanand Singh, besides MLC Sunil Singh, and Tejashwi’s key aide Sanjay Yadav, blaming them for the party’s defeat and demanding their expulsion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-bypolls-nitish-kumar-thanks-voters-for-reposing-their-faith-in-jdu-101635937588937.html

Also read: ‘Har Ghar Dastak’: Modi rolls out door-to-door Covid-19 vaccination campaignThe decision is aimed at mitigating the hardships faced by these workers due to loss of livelihood in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, an official statement said. The amount will be directly transferred into the bank accounts of the workers registered with the Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Board, it said. The board has nearly 3.17 lakh registered construction workers across the state, and the disbursement is likely to involve an expenditure of ₹90- ₹100 crore, the statement said. Earlier this year, another instalment of financial relief was given to registered construction workers in Punjab. Channi also asked all sarpanch and councillors to get construction workers registered so that they could benefit from welfare schemes extended by the board. The chief minister, who is also the chairman of the board, said his government was committed to helping those sections of society who did not have the means to fend for themselves. State labour minister Sangat Singh Gilzian said with improvement in the Covid situation, efforts are being made to accelerate the pace of construction activity across the state to ensure the livelihood of these workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/diwali-gift-punjab-cm-announces-3-100-each-for-construction-workers-101635936717997.html
03-11-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab elections: Capt Amarinder dying duck in a thunderstorm, says Sidhu||A day after Capt Amarinder Singh quit the Congress and announced the launch of the Punjab Lok Congress, state Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu hit out at the former chief minister, calling him a dying duck in a thunderstorm and asked him how many seats he had won the last time he floated a political party. Also read: Punjab politics: Sidhu aides Pargat, Warring gun for Capt Amarinder“Last time when he (Amarinder) formed a party, how many seats did he get? He is a fraudulent person. He could not win his own seat and now will his father make Punjab win?” a belligerent Sidhu told reporters in his home turf of Amritsar on Wednesday. “Neither the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) nor the farmer unions are willing to embrace the Captain. Who is he? Will they touch Paras (touchstone) or an empty cartridge? Whose nose was rubbed in the soil? Who was ousted? Now you are crying like a child. You went to Madam (Sonia Gandhi) with only 800 votes. Who made you president at that time?” Sidhu said, adding that “he (Capt Amarinder) is a dying duck in a thunderstorm.” Sidhu went on to allege that Captain Amarinder’s wife, Preneet Kaur, who is the Patiala Congress MP, was also not with him. “Will Preneet Kaur leave the party? Not even a councillor is with him. He never came out of his home in the last five years,” Sidhu said. Newfound bonding with CM Channi A day after meeting Congress MLAs in Chandigarh, Sidhu seemed to be on the same page with Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi. “It’s been only a month since Channi has become the CM. What else should he do in such a short span? Electricity rates have been slashed. The price of sand will be fixed. Everything will be done. Whatever could have been done in one month, we have done,” he said in reply to a query about the working of the state government. Sidhu was in Amritsar to inaugurate a beautification and development project of Ram Talai temple. Suggesting steps to increase the state’s income, he said, “In 2002, Punjab had been earning ₹3,000 crore from the liquor trade, while Tamil Nadu’s income was only ₹2,500 crore. Now, Tamil Nadu is earning ₹35,000 crore every year, but Punjab is still sitting at ₹3,000 crore. I am not in favour of liquor, but it’s income should be in the state’s exchequer.” Lauding the work of state transport minister Amrinder Singh Raja Warring, the Amritsar East MLA said due to the hard work of the minister, the income of the department had gone up to ₹50 lakh a day. Says fix the rate of sand to prevent theft Sidhu said he has been fighting for Punjab and will continue to work for its people. He urged the Channi government to fix the rate of sand for construction purposes to prevent its illegal mining. “The theft of sand will stop the day its rate is fixed. Be it ₹1,000, 1,100 or 1,200, but fix it,” he said. Lashing out at the Centre for increasing fuel prices, he said the price of petrol in some countries is ₹35 to ₹40, but people in India are forced to spend ₹110. “Discussions have been held with the new CM and soon new policies will be made not for a few months, but for the next generation. A roadmap will be given. Not 500 promises, we will implement only 13 points.” On his meeting with the new Punjab Congress affairs in-charge Harish Chaudhary, he said, “The state’s income will be increased and the VAT on petrol and diesel will be decreased in Punjab. It was also decided during the MLAs’ meeting on Tuesday that five to seven political functionaries will be attached to the CM’s office. They will hear the grievances of the MLAs over phone and all MLAs will stay in their respective constituencies.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-elections-capt-amarinder-dying-duck-in-a-thunderstorm-says-sidhu-101635930597786.html

Also read: Capt Amarinder quits Cong, accuses Gandhis of ‘midnight conspiracy’ against himPargat and Warring, considered close to Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu, attacked the two-time former chief minister who hurled accusations at the Gandhi family, former Punjab affairs in-charge Harish Rawat, ministers and legislators in his seven-page resignation letter in which he also announced the name of his new party, the Punjab Lok Congress. “What an irony - @capt_amarinder’s new party is neither for “Punjabis” nor for “Lok” and certainly not “Congress (sic),” Pargat tweeted, tagging former Congress president Rahul Gandhi, Sidhu and the Congress party. Warring laid into Capt Amarinder over his plans for seat sharing with anti-farmer BJP. “Dear @capt_amaridner Sahab, In ur letter to Hon’ble Congress President u cited @INCPunjab chief Sardar @sherryontopp ‘Hugging’ Pak Army Chief & Pak Pm as ur reason to leave the party. As u now r ‘Seat Sharing’ with Anti Farmer BJP Here r few pictures of ur new found BumChums,” he posted on Twitter, with old photos of Prime Minister Narendra Modi with then Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif. In his letter, Capt Amarinder, who was made to resign from the post of chief minister on September 18 following a long-drawn tussle with Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu, four cabinet ministers and several party legislators, wrote that despite his reservations and over the unanimous advice of almost all members of Parliament from Punjab, Sidhu, whom he called an acolyte of the Pakistani deep state, was appointed as the state unit chief. “Sidhu’s only claim to fame was that he would abuse me and my government on a regular basis. I am old enough to be his father but that did not stop him from using the filthiest and most vile language against me both publicly and privately,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-politics-sidhu-aides-pargat-warring-gun-for-capt-amarinder-101635913735532.html
03-11-2021||Delhi||Clear sky in Delhi even as air quality remains in ‘very poor’ category||Delhi is likely to have a clear sky on Wednesday with mist in the morning, India Meteorological Department (IMD) said even as the air quality remained in the “very poor” category a day before Diwali. The minimum temperature on Wednesday was likely to be 14 and maximum 30 degrees Celsius. On Tuesday, the minimum temperature was 14.5 and the maximum 29.6 degrees Celsius, a notch below normal. The IMD said mainly clear sky is also expected on Thursday which will change to partly overcast weather for at least four days from Friday.According to the Central Pollution Control Board, the hourly Air Quality Index (AQI) at 8 am was 302 on Wednesday. On Tuesday, the average 24-hour AQI was 303 in the “very poor” category. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.On Tuesday, the Union earth science ministry’s System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (Safar) said the overall air quality of Delhi was in the lower end of the “very poor” category. The quality was expected to improve but remain in the upper side of the “poor” range until Wednesday. “...stubble related emissions will remain marginal (<10%) in spite of higher fire count due to unfavourable wind direction. The share of stubble burning emissions is just 6%. The stubble burning induced impact in AQI is expected to increase significantly from 4th November onwards due to transport-level winds reaching Delhi from North-Westerly where large stubble burning hot spots are expected.”Also Read: “Delhiwale: Winter’s ambassador, eat itSafar said the air quality on Diwali (Thursday) will also depend on the extent of observance of the firecracker ban. “Under zero firecracker emission scenario, the level of PM2.5 is predicted to be at the in the upper end of very poor during 4-6th November. However, even if we consider 50% of additional firecracker related emissions of 2019, then AQI is predicted to degrade to the Severe category from 4th November night onwards and will remain severe until 5th November,” it said. “It is predicted to improve slightly on 6th Nov but will fluctuate between High-end of Very Poor to the Severe range. This is mainly due to the coincidence of all critical factors with a peak PM2.5 surpassing 300 ug/m3 on 5th November.”The stubble fire share in Delhi’s PM2.5 is expected to be between 20-40% from November 4 to 6 if its counts are assumed to be similar to last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/clear-sky-in-delhi-even-as-air-quality-remains-in-very-poor-category-101635911094708.html
03-11-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Winter’s ambassador, eat it||It’s just another tiresome evening in the Walled City’s Chawri Bazar. The entire road from the rear of the Jama Masjid to Ashok Chaat Corner is blocked by a massive traffic jam. Gradually the twilight hour arrives, and the light envelopes the dusty bazaar in a golden hue.Against this backdrop, Aadesh Kumar is sighted with a platter filled with what seems to be freshly fallen snow. This is Old Delhi’s most fabled dessert, and surfaces only in winter. “This time I started Daulat ki Chaat on October 19,” says Mr Kumar. A street vendor, he sells spicy golgappas the rest of the year.Much legend is attached to the making of the dish. The popular fairy tale is that the “pure” Buffalo milk is whisked with cream under a full moon sky, and it is the night dew—the oas—that sets the resulting froth. Mr Kumar clarifies that “these days we use ice instead of oas.” (Probably full moon night too is dispensable.)This soft-spoken man in black mask inherited the occupation from his “papaji”, Shri Khemchand, who is selling Daulat ki Chaat some streets away in Kinari Bazar. Every morning both father and son get up at three in their home in nearby Sitaram Bazar and whisk the milk with their respective “mathni” until a great froth builds up by nine. A typical platter holds 15kgs of the dessert. The golden layer on the top, Mr Kumar reveals, is made of kesar (saffron), pistachio nuts, and almonds. Priced at ₹80 a plate, the froth is garnished for the customer at the last moment with bhoora (ground sugar) and roasted khoya (condensed milk). Served with a wooden chammach (spoon), the first sensation on tasting Daulat ki Chaat is as if one had furtively licked a slice of someone else’s prized butter. The lingering sweetness is as airy as a gossamer’s gauze.Hawked amid the flies and fumes of Chandni Chowk, Kinari Bazar and Chawri Bazar, the dessert is veiled within a fine cotton cloth. “The business is very low so far,” confides Mr Kumar as he takes off his mask, flashing a smile. The dish will disappear by Holi, in March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-winter-s-ambassador-eat-it-101635898359764.html

According to them, they are only getting one-third of the cars and SUVs as compared to the demand. Booking on selective models, meanwhile, has gone up in last seven to eight months.Auto dealers said the situation will remain similar till June 2022 or when the production of semiconductors will be streamlined as all cars have a semiconductor chip installed in them. An auto dealer near Dholewal said they made deliveries on Tuesday, but the vehicles were pre-booked. He added that they used to have a stock of around 100 vehicles, but nowadays they have only 30 vehicles in the inventory.

03-11-2021||Chandigarh||Lacklustre sales dash hopes of Ludhiana jewellers on Dhanteras||Jewellers in Ludhiana remained a disappointed lot as they did not receive the footfall they were expecting on Dhanteras. The usual scenes of buyers flooding the shops for gold and silver were missing on Tuesday. Ravneet Singh, a jeweller in the Model Town market said, “Expecting a major rush, I had ordered a lot of jewellery items from Mumbai and Surat, but unfortunately not many customers turned up. In pre-Covid times, we used to get busy from the time of opening of the shop and had to request the customers to leave around 11pm. The pandemic has highly affected the spending capacity of the buyers.” He added that most of the people came to purchase silver instead of gold. “Silver ornaments or coins were majorly in demand instead of gold this time. A customer who usually spent around ₹50,000 to buy 10gm gold on Dhanteras demanded a 2gm coin worth ₹10,000 as a shagun on the occasion. Moreover, the price of gold is also high due to less supply from Mumbai,” he said. The gold rate on Dhanteras was recorded at ₹49,400 per 10 gram and silver price was ₹67,000 per kg. A staffer of a renowned jewellery store in Ghumar Mandi, on the condition of anonymity, said, “We saw a good footfall of customers at our shop for gold jewellery, but we couldn’t sell as many heavy sets as we usually sold on Dhanteras before Covid.”Meanwhile, heavy rush was seen at crockery shops where people bought copper and steel utensils on the occasion.Ram Gopal Chaudhary, owner of one such shop at Ghumar Mandi, said people started coming in the morning to buy utensils. Items like cookers, fry pans, glasses, bowls, jugs, and plates were majorly in demand, he added. “Unlike last year, when corona crushed the business completely, buyers reached us this time on Dhanteras. I am hopeful of doing a good business till closure of the shop,” he added. Sushma Mittal, owner of another crockery store in the area said, “It is an auspicious day and thus buyers tend to purchase some metal on the occasion. We got more buyers on Sunday instead. This time, the footfall is much better as compared to the last Dhanteras but less number of people turned up as expected. A few customers even purchased a single bowl or a serving spoon of steel as a ritual.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/lacklustre-sales-dash-hopes-of-ludhiana-jewellers-on-dhanteras-101635894290722.html
03-11-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana road cave-in plays spoilsport for shopkeepers this Dhanteras||At a time when festive fervour has taken over the city and shopkeepers appear joyful after witnessing heavy rush of customers in the markets on Dhanteras, those on the main Deep Nagar road are in distress as their business took a hit following the road cave-in incident. The road has been closed due to ongoing repair works after a major portion of road caved in on October 3 wherein three persons, including two students, had a narrow escape, after they fell into the crater. Shopkeepers could be seen sitting idle outside their shops on Tuesday. Ruing losses, they slammed the civic body for the ‘slow pace’ of repair work. They said the Ludhiana municipal corporation has failed to repair the damaged portion of the road in the last six days and another stretch has further been dug for installing a new sewer line in the area. A jeweller near the cave-in site, Sanjay Sood, said, “We witness heavy rush of customers on Dhanteras as it is believed that purchasing gold and silver is auspicious on this day. But this year, not a single customer showed up at the shop till afternoon as the passage has been blocked. This is the main road of the area and a large number of residents move use this. The authorities should have repaired the road at the earliest, but they are rather delaying the work, which is condemnable. Few shopkeepers in the area are not even able to open their shops which are situated adjoining the cave-in site.”Expressing resentment, the shopkeepers said the pandemic and financial crises had taken a toll on their business last year and when they expected it to improve, the apathy of the civic body compounded their misery. A garment shop owner, Akshit Khurana, said, “Every business witnesses a boost during the festival season, but no customer has stepped into our shops for the last three to four days. One side of the road towards Deep Nagar is open, but the commuters do not enter the passage due to blockage.”The road blockade has further added to the woes of those shopkeepers who are running their business on rented accommodation. “How will the shopkeepers pay their rent and bear the household expenses if they are not even able to do business during the festival season. The authorities should pay heed to the problem, but they are bothered about other issues,” said Amrik Singh, a furniture shop owner in the area. Despite repeated attempts, comments of MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal could not be elicited. However, one of the MC officials in the operations and maintenance cell said that apart from the repair works, they were also installing a new sewer line in the area to avoid any cave-in incident in the future. “The labour is working continuously at the site and the process might take around two weeks,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-road-cave-in-plays-spoilsport-for-shopkeepers-this-dhanteras-101635894110750.html

Drama over resignation of Punjab advocate general continues||There was more confusion over the resignation of Punjab advocate general APS Deol on Tuesday as a letter purportedly written by the state’s top law officer went viral on the social media, claiming that he had quit. The chief minister’s office, however, denied receiving any such letter and claimed that the AG had not resigned. The AG office said Deol had quit but his resignation was not accepted. “We have also received some calls (about the letter), but we don’t know if it is genuine or fake.

The petitioner Gurdwara Sahib Dasmesh Darbar had moved the top court against the October 18, 2021 communication of the Union home ministry which declined its proposal to allow a Jatha (group of people) of 55 pilgrims to visit Sikh religious places in Pakistan either from October 23, 2021, to November 1, 2021, or from November 1, 2021, to November 11, 2021. The ministry had said there have been certain restrictions on movement due to COVID-19 and asked the petitioner to consider joining the Jatha from November 17, 2021, to November 26, 2021, for visiting gurdwaras in Pakistan on the occasion of Gurpurb and asked it to send the proposal through State Government of Punjab. While refusing to interfere with the decision of the Centre, a bench of Justices S K Kaul and M M Sundresh noted that due to the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, certain restraints were put on the persons who wish to go to Pakistan. “In our view, the aforesaid forms part of the practical administrative domain of the government to spread the visit of jathas over a period of time. It is the say of the petitioner that they are older persons and they can be accommodated. They could have made a further representation if they are so pleased. It is not as if the petitioner is not being permitted to visit but their proposal is sought through the channel of the state government for the period in question. “We are thus of the view that there is no infringement of the Constitutional right for invocation of the jurisdiction under Article 32 of the Constitution of India which would enable us to interfere with the aforesaid process. The writ petition is dismissed accordingly,” the bench said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sc-refuses-to-entertain-sikh-devotees-plea-to-visit-pakistan-gurdwara-for-guru-nanak-s-551st-birth-anniversary-101635884690623.html
03-11-2021||Chandigarh||Poonch encounter: Local arrested from Nepal for providing logistical support to terrorists||Police have arrested a local, who was allegedly providing logistical support to terrorists hiding in the Nar Khas forests of Poonch district, where the protracted operation entered 23rd day on Tuesday. He was identified as Yasir Arafat, a resident of Bhata Dhurian. “The terror operative was detained a few days ago with two others from Kathmandu by a police team. They were trying to flee to a Gulf country on October 25,” said police sources. Ten people, including two women, were earlier detained for questioning during the operation in Bhutti Durrian forest. The operation started in Surankote forest on October 11 following the killing of five soldiers, including a junior commissioned officer, and was subsequently extended to Mendhar to neutralise the fleeing terrorists where another encounter took place on October 14, leaving four soldiers, including another JCO, dead. Pakistani terrorist Zia Mustafa, who was shifted from Kot Bhalwal central jail in Jammu to Mendhar on police remand for questioning in connection with the operation, was killed when the security forces accompanying him to identify a hideout came under fire from hiding terrorists on October 24. The questioning of Arafat revealed his links with Mustafa, who is the alleged mastermind in the March 2003 Nadimarg massacre of 24 Kashmiri Hindus, and his handlers across the border, the officials said, without giving further details. Arafat was detained by a police party from Kathmandu in Nepal along with Mohammad Noor of Gulhutta-Mendhar and Mohammad Rashid of Bhatti Durrian while they were on their way to Saudi Arabia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/poonch-encounter-local-arrested-from-nepal-for-providing-logistical-support-to-terrorists-101635884689344.html

In the name of fighting terrorism, these agencies and laws are being weaponised against citizens who hold a different viewpoint from the government.”Questioning the need to create a new security agency, the PAGD spokesman said there was no need to create another agency.“What was the need to add one more such agency, when already NIA and UAPA have created havoc among the people by gross misuse of these draconian measures,” Tarigami said.The PAGD spokesperson said J&K is a political issue and needs a political outreach. “What was required to be done was to provide relief and not any addition to such harsh measures which are bound to deepen their alienation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/state-investigation-agency-another-repressive-tools-gupkar-alliance-101635884208762.html
03-11-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab CM Channi, Navjot Sidhu go on ‘patch-up’ pilgrimage to Kedarnath amid tussle||Amid their growing unease with each other, Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi and state Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu travelled to the Kedarnath Temple in Uttarakhand on Tuesday to put up a show of unity. The two left for the shrine in a helicopter in the morning along with All India Congress Committee (AICC) secretary in-charge of Punjab affairs Harish Chaudhary and Punjab Vidhan speaker Rana KP Singh. The visit was planned by the leadership, particularly Chaudhary, to try for a rapprochement between the two leaders whose tense relations got the party worried and show that all is well in the state Congress. Both leaders have not been on the same page on senior appointments and allocation of portfolios. Sidhu has been adamant on removal of advocate general APS Deol who resigned from his post on Monday. However, there is still no clarity on whether his resignation has been accepted or not by the chief minister who declined to answer questions on the issue at press conference a day ago.A senior party leader privy to developments said the shrine visit has given the message that Channi and Sidhu are ready to work together. “Their inability to resolve their differences and work together with just three months left for the elections was not sending the right message. My information is that they both vowed to work together. If this does not work, the party will have to find some other way,” he said, requesting anonymity.The Punjab leaders first reached Dehradun and met former Punjab affairs in-charge Harish Rawat and videos of their meeting at the latter’s residence were also shared on social media. After meeting them, Rawat told reporters that all is well in Punjab and everything is running very smoothly. “Whatever challenges there are will be faced. I am confident this scenario will continue. And you will see Congress will win the elections. He (Chaudhary) will take the party towards victory in the state,” he said. Though Channi and Sidhu did not respond to calls, both posted photos of their visit to the shrine. “Life is fragile, handle with prayer...At Kedarnath, the heavenly abode of Lord Shiva …. Har Har Mahadev !” Sidhu tweeted. The chief minister also tweeted, “Paid obeisance at the Kedarnath Shrine in Uttarakhand and prayed for the progress of Punjab and prosperity of its people”. However, their “unity trip” drew digs from within the Congress. Former Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar tweeted: “Political Pilgrims But each one trying to appease a different Deity (sic)”. “United face of Punjab Congress...but why in uttarakhand why not in Punjab (sic),” party’s Ludhiana MP Ravneet Singh Bittu posted on Twitter with a photo in which Sidhu, Chaudhary, Channi and Rana KP were seen holding their hands aloft.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-cm-channi-navjot-sidhu-go-on-patch-up-pilgrimage-to-kedarnath-amid-tussle-101635883848890.html

03-11-2021||Chandigarh||Capt Amarinder quits Cong, accuses Gandhis of ‘midnight conspiracy’ against him||Former chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Tuesday resigned from the Congress and announced the formation of his new party, Punjab Lok Congress. In a seven-page resignation letter to party president Sonia Gandhi, the two-time ex- chief minister said the “midnight conspiracy” carried out against him at the behest of her and her children by calling a Congress Legislature Party (CLP) meeting over his head at the dead of the night and that too through Twitter was the most “egregious” act. “It was my prerogative as the CLP leader to have called the meeting if the AICC desired it. It was only early next morning that a colleague informed me that such an outrageous act has been committed,” he wrote. He said the crude manner in which the whole operation was executed “left a very foul taste in the mouth”. Amarinder said he felt deeply hurt by her conduct and that of her children who he still loved as much as his own, having known their father, since they were in school together in 1954. “…I hope that no other senior Congressperson is subjected to the ignominy that I was put through,” the letter read. ‘Concerned about state being given in inexperienced hands’ Amarinder wrote that he was quite concerned about the inexperienced hands in which the state was given. “It is beyond my comprehension as how these inexperienced hands will handle the security situation in view of the massive influx of weapons and explosives and narcotics. We are gravely threatened by narco-terrorism that our hostile neighbour is sponsoring against us,” he said. The veteran leader was made to resign by the Congress high command on September 18 following his long-drawn tussle with Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu, four cabinet ministers and several party MLAs amid fears that anti-incumbency arising from his style of functioning could hurt the party’s chances in the upcoming polls. Charanjit Singh Channi, who was among the rebel ministers, was picked by the party as the next CM of the state. ‘Rahul, Priyanka patronised Navjot Sidhu’ The veteran leader also stated that despite his reservations and over the unanimous advice of almost all the MPs from Punjab, Sidhu, an acolyte of the Pakistani deep state, was appointed as the Punjab Congress president. “Sidhu’s only claim to fame was that he would abuse me and my government on a regular basis. I am old enough to be his father but that did not stop him from using the filthiest and most vile language against me both publicly and privately,” he wrote. Amarinder said that rather than being reined in, he was patronised by Rahul and Priyanka, while she (Sonia) chose to turn a blind eye. “I told you that Sidhu is a person of unstable mind and you will one day regret this decision and it would be too late by then,” he wrote, adding, “I am sure you must be regretting it now”. ‘Cong MLAs involved in illegal sand mining’ Training his guns at his former colleagues over illegal sand mining, the former CM said that Congress MLAs and ministers, including an overwhelming number in the current government, were the offenders. “One of my enduring regrets would remain as to why I did not take some of them to task. The thought that it would embarrass the party held me back,” he wrote, declaring his intent to make public their names which were provided to him by the state government and intelligence from time to time. Besides listing his achievements during his second term, particularly the state’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, and record 92% implementation of election manifesto, he also recalled, in the letter, the circumstances in which he entered politics and his journey over 52 years of public life, including the tough stance taken by him at various critical moments in Punjab’s history. Formal launch of party, symbol later On his new party, Amarinder said the registration of the party was pending approval with the Election Commission of India. “Since I announced that I will be forming my own party, my team of lawyers is working on the process and has applied to the Election Commission for the registration,” he said. He said the Election Commission had no objection to the proposed name, Punjab Lok Congress. About the party symbol, he said the EC had given three symbols from which one was to be chosen. “We have submitted three symbols and the final one will be chosen from the set of six, three suggested by the EC and three proposed by the party,” he said, adding, “The party will be formally launched later and its policies, programmes, agenda and vision will be spelt out at the time of the launch.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/capt-amarinder-quits-congress-accuses-gandhis-of-midnight-conspiracy-against-him-101635883548543.html
03-11-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab CM Channi trying to befool people like Amarinder did: Sukhbir Badal||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Tuesday said Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi was trying to befool people in the same manner as his predecessor Amarinder Singh did and he does not have any intention of keeping the promises he has made. Addressing a press conference in Ludhiana, the SAD leader said, “The chief minister is indulging in political stunts just to garner votes. Channi admitted to this yesterday by saying that he only wanted consumers to get one power bill with reduced tariff. Even (Punjab Congress president) Navjot Singh Sidhu has exposed his own government saying sops were being given only for two months.”Sukhbir said Channi failed to tell how he would make good on his promise when his government’s corruption and mismanagement have virtually bankrupted the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL). Asserting that the state government did not have any roadmap to meet the financial requirements of the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL)., the Akali leader said the “mismanagement” would result in the closure of thermal plants, disruption of coal supply and inability to disburse salaries to employees. If the state government intended to cancel power purchase agreements (PPAs) with private thermal plants it should come out with an executive order instead of mere resolutions which would achieve nothing, he claimed.“The government should take into account the scenario of facing penalty of around ₹10,000 crore which it would have to pay if it scraps the agreements. Also, executive decisions should also be taken not to implement the three farm laws and refuse extension of the BSF jurisdiction in Punjab,” he added.Sukhbir said if the CM really feels for people, he can easily reduce the prices of petrol and diesel by bringing down the tax component.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-cm-channi-trying-to-befool-people-like-amarinder-did-sukhbir-badal-101635883189870.html

03-11-2021||Chandigarh||BJP’s defeat in Ellenabad bypoll is a good sign: Charuni||Reacting to the Ellenabad bypoll results, farm leader Gurnam Singh Charuni said on Tuesday that it is a good sign that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate Gobind Kanda faced defeat.“I don’t want to speak about who won the election as some farm leaders were in support of a contender. But it’s a good sign that the ruling BJP faced defeat,” Charuni said, during his visit to Karnal.Charuni was called by the one-member commission formed to investigate the sequence of events that led to police lathi-charge at Karnal’s Bastara toll plaza on August 28.He said he had brought his written statement to submit before the commission but he could not submit it on Tuesday as later he realised that the statement required some additions.“Now, I will submit my statement on November 10,” he added. He also slammed the government over shortage of DAP fertiliser and increasing prices of fuel and LPG.Justice Som Nath Aggarwal (retd), head of the inquiry commission, had earlier said that the commission will require around four months to complete the investigation.The statements of total 35 people, including Karnal district magistrate, superintendent of police, the then Karnal SDM Ayush Sinha, and other cops will also be recorded.The commission has already recorded the statements of six farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bjps-defeat-in-ellenabad-bypoll-is-a-good-sign-charuni-101635882110754.html
03-11-2021||Chandigarh||Ellenabad bypoll: INLD wins but BJP-JJP also gain||The Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) which scraped through on Tuesday to retain the Ellenabad assembly seat in Sirsa salvaged its reputation.The win would mean a re-entry for Abhay Singh Chautala, son of former chief minister Om Prakash Chautala, in the state assembly as INLD’s sole public representative.The ruling BJP-JJP combine did give a scare to Abhay, who had quit the seat earlier this year in protest against the three central agri-marketing laws. The BJP, in particular, will be happy to finish a close second in light of the strong Opposition it has been facing from the farm unions.The assembly constituency bordering Rajasthan has traditionally been a stronghold of former chief minister Om Prakash Chautala and was the only seat won by the INLD post a split in the 2019 assembly polls.Good and bad news for INLDThere was some good and some bad news for the INLD. The party managed to increase its vote share in this bypoll by 5.63% as compared to 2019 assembly polls which should warm their hearts.But its margin of victory came down from 11,922 in 2019 to 6,739 this time (a loss of 5,183 votes). The reason for decrease in Abhay’s victory margin was primarily due to the gains the ruling BJP-JJP made in terms of vote share.The BJP’s vote share saw a 9.1% increase in the bypoll as compared to the 2019 general elections.In fact, the Congress saw a 9.7% erosion of its vote share in the bypoll which arithmetically can be co-related to the 9.1% gain made by the BJP-JJP combine.“It seems that a chunk of Congress voters, possibly the Scheduled Caste, gravitated towards the ruling alliance. The JJP candidate in 2019 got about 6,500 votes and those too added up the numbers for alliance candidate Gobind Kanda, a moneybag,” said a political analyst.The BJP-JJP candidate scored well in the urban pockets of the constituency. This was evident from the outcome of rounds 8, 9 and 10 (urban pockets) of counting, the only three rounds of total 16 where Kanda led (by about 5,195 votes).Will INLD’s win give impetus to the farm stir?Prof Ashutosh Kumar, a political scientist from the Panjab University, Chandigarh, said Chautala’s victory may encourage the farmers to dabble in electoral politics, particularly in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh. “The bypoll result may have implications for western Uttar Pradesh,” Prof Kumar said.‘Silent rejection of farm protest’Prof Kumar said the fact that the BJP-JJP combine increased its vote share and unexpectedly performed well in the bypoll indicated that there were voters who may not be vocal but silently lend support to them.“One may perceive that the farm protest has a widespread appeal and support. But the lingering protest can also have a counter-productive reaction where people remain muted but express their rejection or dissatisfaction in terms of votes,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ellenabad-bypoll-inld-wins-but-bjp-jjp-also-gain-101635881928786.html
03-11-2021||Lucknow||Vantangiyas look forward to celebrate Diwali with UP CM||GORAKHPUR For locals in Jangl Tinkonia, one of 23 villages inhabited by the Vantangiyas in Gorakhpur, Diwali celebrations are incomplete without chief minister Yogi Adityanath who has shared a special bond with this forest dwelling community for many years as Gorakhpur MP.This time too, the locals are eagerly waiting for his arrival and are busy making preparations to welcome the CM on the occasion of Diwali on Thursday. Such is the popularity of Yogi Adityanath that even the elderly people said that they would not light ‘diyas’ if the CM doesn’t come on Diwali. “The district administration has completed all preparations for the proposed visit of the chief minister on Thursday,” said Vijay Kiran Anand, district magistrate, Gorakhpur.The Vantangiya people, who were brought here from Myanmar during colonial rule for afforestation activities, said they are grateful to Adityanath for declaring the 23 villages as ‘revenue villages’. A revenue village is a small administrative region with defined bordersAfter becoming MP in 2009, Yogi Adityanath always went to Jangl Tinkonia (in his parliamentary constituency) and celebrated Diwali with underprivileged children by distributing sweets, books and pencils among them. He continued to celebrate Diwali every year with them even after becoming chief minister.“After becoming CM in 2017, the first thing Yogiji did was to change the miserable conditions of Vantangiyas by ensuring that all basic facilities – roads, power, education and healthcare were provided to them. His government also accorded revenue village status to 23 Vantangiya villages for the first time since independence, paving way for locals to avail these facilities like any other citizen. Prior to this, the community was even deprived of their basic right to vote. This initiative has strengthened the bond between the community and Yogiji,” said BJP leader Jarnadan Singh. Under the Yogi Government, the picture of the entire village has changed – houses which remained in dark are lit up with electricity, schools are being set up for children, villages being connected with roads, health services are accessible by locals, benefits of schemes are reaching people and pucca houses have been built, he said. “The Vantangiyas had never celebrated such a joyous Diwali the way they have in the last four and a half years,” said the BJP leader. Banshu, 70, a villager, thanked the chief minister for the development work. “Whatever work you see in the village, has been done by Yogiji. Nobody else bothered in the past.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/vantangiyas-look-forward-to-celebrate-diwali-with-up-cm-101635881808348.html
03-11-2021||Pune||Pune’s air quality likely to deteriorate to very poor on Nov 5: Safar||PUNE As Diwali is here, the air quality index (AQI) is likely to deteriorate to poor on November 4 and very poor on November 5, according to officials from the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar). However, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast light rainfall from November 4 to November 6 with generally cloudy skies. Speaking about the air quality, Dr BS Murthy, director, Safar and scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), said that with Diwali falling in November this year when winter is already set in, with 50% additional firecracker scenario AQI will deteriorate.“Due to the low minimum temperatures between 18 to 19 degree Celsius, the mixing layer height is likely to be low and winds are expected to be calm leading to accumulation and hence, faster deterioration. There is a likelihood of rain during Diwali period, if it drizzles then it may further deteriorate the air quality, but sufficient rain will wash away pollutants and AQI will be better,” said Murthy.He added that if no firecrackers are burned then AQI will remain in the moderate category during the entire period“Citizens should take extra precautions during the early morning hours of November 5, but it will be back to moderate levels from the next day. Most polluted areas in Pune city on November 5 are likely to be Shivajinagar and Bhosari,” said Dr Murthy.As per the weather department, the city may also experience thunderstorms and lightning along with rainfall.Speaking about the forecast, Anupam Kashyapi, head of the weather forecasting at IMD PUne said that till November 3, parts of the city may experience thunderstorms and lightning with very light rainfall.“Between November 4 and November 6, the skies will be cloudy and light rainfall is forecast for the city. The day temperature will be around 30 degrees whereas night temperatures will be around 19 degrees Celsius during this time,” said Kashyapi.In the long range forecast for November rainfall published by the IMD on Tuesday, the weather department noted that there is a probability for above normal rainfall in many parts of Maharashtra for this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/punes-air-quality-likely-to-deteriorate-to-very-poor-on-nov-5-safar-101635880489885.html
03-11-2021||Dehradun||‘May Kedarbaba forgive them’: TS Rawat on being stopped from entering Kedarnath||DEHRADUN: Former chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat, who was prevented by priests opposed to the Char Dham Board from praying at Kedarnath shrine on Monday, said what happened in Kedarnath was not according to the values and identity of Devbhoomi Uttarakhand (land of gods).“May Kedarbaba forgive them (protesting priests),” the former chief minister and senior Uttarakhand Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader said on Tuesday.“Whatever happened yesterday (Monday) is not allowed by a civilised society…the kind of slogans that were raised…were not the ones that unite people…they were not right”, he told reporters here.On whether there is politics behind the Monday incident, Rawat said “There are some people who are into this due to political reasons…but some are into it due to their vested interests…and some due to mere carelessness...”. Rawat said the sentiments of crores of Hindus living across the world, who want to come to Char Dham, should be respected. “What they want should be respected. So I have said this that formation of Char Dham Board has been the most progressive decision in the 20-year history of the state”, he said “Some people will feel pain but we should care about people who come to Char Dham to pray for relieving of their pains”, he said.“It should be clearly understood that there are 51 more temples under Char Dham Devasthanam Board, apart from the four Char Dham shrines. There are issues related to the maintenance of these 51 temples. The priests and managers of these 51 temples are not opposing the Board. But their voice is not being highlighted. Only those who are protesting are being heard”, he said. Rawat said boards and trusts have been formed for the management of many temples and shrines in the country, where a lot of change has been witnessed after the formation of boards. “Such changes need to be studied. Colleges, universities and hospitals are being run by such boards and trusts”, he said.The former chief minister said two years ago Jageshwar temple trust was formed on the demand of the local people. “Now people in Purnagiri and Devidhara areas are making similar demands for temples there”, he said.Rawat compared opposition to Char Dham Board to the opposition by farmers to three farms laws. “Farmers are opposing but they are not ready to tell you what exactly they are opposing. ….similarly, here opposition to Char Dham is happening for the sake of opposition… This is not right… If the government bows now, in the coming time, it will create a lot of problems for future governments”, he said.Senior Congress leader and former chief minister Harish Rawat when asked about the incident, said he doesn’t agree with it and it should not have happened. “Baba Kedar forgives all…so in the land of Kedar Baba, all should be forgiven…But priests are angry over the delay…”.KK Kotiyal, president Char Dham Tirath Purohit Haq Haqooki Mahapanchayat said protesting priests stopped Trivendra Singh Rawat from having darshan at Kedarnath on Monday as they were very angry. “The state government promised that the stalemate over Char Dham Board will be resolved by October 30. But nothing has been done. It was Trivendra Singh Rawat whose government pushed the formation of the Char Dham Board. Those responsible for all this are not welcome here”, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/may-kedarbaba-forgive-them-ts-rawat-on-being-stopped-from-entering-kedarnath-101635880488246.html

03-11-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Gold shines but auto sales dip this Dhanteras||Markets filled up for the first time since the pandemic on Tuesday on the occasion of Dhanteras. The sale of jewellery of both gold and silver picked up significantly with jewellers reporting much higher numbers than the previous year even as automobile sales remained low due to the shortage in supply.Vinod Talwar, president, Jewellers’ Association, Chandigarh, said, “Last year our sales were dismal and this year we had sold more than twice just by the evening time. The situation has improved now.”Talwar added that the rates had also climbed high on Tuesday, but this also didn’t stop people. “The rate of 24 karat gold was around ₹49,500 for 10 grams. Silver was for ₹68,000 per kg. Both prices had increased in recent days, but still people waited till Dhanteras to make their purchases.”Speaking about which jewellery was the most popular, Chandigarh Jewellers Association president Rajeev Sahdev said, “Throughout the year silver sales are more than gold, but on Dhanteras we saw more gold sales. People buy gold either in coin form or in jewellery like necklaces, pendants or mangalsutras depending on their needs. The sale of silver coins also jumped on Tuesday.”It is also considered auspicious to purchase automobiles on Dhanteras. However, this year sales remained low. Vice-president of the Federation of Chandigarh Regional Automobile Dealers Ranjeev Dahuja said, “The overall sales have dropped from around 1,000 vehicles last year to around 500 this year due to the shortage of supply. The demand, however, remains high and SUVs continue to remain most popular in Chandigarh.”Explaining the shortage, Nitin Mehan who owns Autopace Chandigarh, a Maruti Suzuki dealership, added, “There is a global shortage of semi-conductor chips which has impacted the automobile industry. Our supply has also been affected.”Due to this, there were no attractive discounts on Dhanteras and the waiting period for popular cars has reached up to 1 year.The sale of two-wheelers also remained on the lower side. Senior vice-president of Platinum Honda for the tricity Sushil Dutta said, “The fact that Dhanteras was on Tuesday also affected the sales. Around 10-15% people who had booked their two-wheelers for Tuesday rescheduled for Wednesday and Thursday as they didn’t want to buy a vehicle on a Tuesday.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhgold-shines-but-auto-sales-dip-this-dhanteras-101635879711759.html

A private company will be running the buses against the advertisement rights on the buses.The issue of local bus service was hanging fire for the past decade.City mayor Amarjeet Singh Sidhu said, “We are in talks with the Chandigarh administration to allow us one special bus, which would run for the PGIMER and drop patients in the morning as well as in the evening so that they can come back.”On the other hand, opposition councillors opposed the move saying it should not be privatised and the MC should run the buses on its own.Deputy mayor Kuljeet Singh Bedi said the issue of local buses was hanging fire for the past decade and the SAD government failed to do anything and now they were opposing it. “Our main aim is to serve the poor by fixing the ticket of ₹10,” he said.Opposition councillor Manjit Singh Sethi claimed that the employees of the municipal corporation were taking bribes from rehri owners.On this, MC commissioner Kamal Garg said these were serious allegations and would be investigated.Speaking on the resolution regarding the extension of the Mohali municipal corporation’s sanitation contract, the mayor said due to the issue of recruitment of employees by the corporation, this work had been delayed a bit so the work of the old contractor company had been extended for three months. On the issue of non-issuance of experience certificates by the contractor to the sanitation employees, commissioner Kamal Garg said strict instructions had been issued to the contractor to issue experience certificates to these workers.Another resolution empowered Garg to set up an appellate authority in the case of street vendors.Simultaneously, a resolution was passed unanimously for the installation of about 100 cameras for the protection of women in Mohali. Another resolution regarding the supply of “parali” briquettes in the crematorium under the MC was also passed unanimously.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohali-mc-gives-nod-to-city-bus-service-101635879353814.html
03-11-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh withholds order of giving DC rate salary to NHM staff||Two months after the decision, the UT health department on Tuesday withheld its decision of giving salaries to the National Health Mission (NHM) employees in Chandigarh as per the DC rate and said the decision needed to be re-examined carefully.In the order, mission director, NHM, Chandigarh, said, “The aspect of pay to NHM staff as per the DC rate needs to be re-examined carefully after getting status from other UTs, Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. Till then the guidelines issued by the Central government for service conditions, including pay, will be strictly followed.”Meanwhile, the 178 terminated NHM employees threatened to go on an indefinite hunger strike from Wednesday to press for their demand for rolling back their termination orders and hiking their salaries on par with the DC rate without revising working conditions.The department had terminated 178 contractual NHM employees on October 28 after they missed their duties on October 27 to protest against the revised working conditions offered against a salary hike at the Government Multi-Specialty Hospital (GMSH), Sector 16. “We have been protesting against the UT administration, but they are not ready to listen to our demands. The orders of termination came only in two hours. However, to press for our demands, we will go on a hunger strike from Wednesday and will continue to protest even on Diwali,” said Amit Kumar, general secretary of the NHM union, while adding that the administration was ready to give more salaries to outsourced staff but was intentionally harassing the NHM employees.Meanwhile, UT health secretary Yashpal Garg said, “Even if the NHM will take legal actions, we are ready to face it, but there is no chance of rolling back their termination orders. They have put the lives of hundreds of patients at risk by going on an unplanned strike and for us, providing patient care to the needy and saving their lives is our foremost priority. Even if we continue with their services, they may again go on strike and we cannot trust them anymore.”Around 500 NHM employees, working under the UT health department as doctors, paramedical staff and managerial employees include nursing officers, pharmacy officers, auxiliary nurse midwives, lab technicians, dental technicians and other Group-4 staffers, have been working for salaries lower than the approved minimum wages since 2013. Earlier in August, over 300 NHM workers went on indefinite leave for 12 days to press for their demand for equal wages for equal work. Following the continuous protest, the UT administration had given a written assurance of salary hike and written, “The finance department has no objection to meet the additional expenditure of ₹3.92 crore annually from the state budget for paying salaries on par with the DC rate to the NHM workers.”The department then terminated 178 employees protesting against the government.The order which has been withheld on Tuesday means that around 322 NHM employees will not get a salary hike as per the DC rate and they will have to continue working at the same salaries as now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-withholds-order-of-giving-dc-rate-salary-to-nhm-staff-101635879351872.html

The arrested man and his associates had created fake websites of the company and cheated customers by making them believe that the services were provided by the original company, the police said.The arrested man, identified as Ashish Singh, earlier worked at the logistics company but lost his job last year because of the Covid-19 pandemic. This is the second arrest made by the crime branch’s cyber cell team that has been investigating the case. Earlier, the team arrested Deepak Goel, also an ex-employee of the company, said deputy commissioner of police (cyber cell, crime branch) Manoj C. During Goel’s interrogation, DCP Manoj said, police found that he would download data of the company’s customers from the official database and sell it to Singh for ₹18,000 every month. Singh went on the run after Goel’s arrest and police conducted raids at his possible hideouts.On October 31, the team received information that Singh was hiding in his village in Uttar Pradesh’s Amethi. The team raided the village and arrested him. “Singh disclosed that he passed the data shared by Goel to his co-accused, one Suresh. We are looking for him,” added the DCP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-man-held-for-creating-fake-website-of-logistics-company-duping-several-customers-101635879290798.html
03-11-2021||Chandigarh||Himachal bypoll: Infighting, inflation prove BJP’s nemesis||The bypoll results in Himachal have dealt a severe blow to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its ‘Mission Repeat’ campaign for the 2022 assembly elections, while the Congress has got a shot in the arm as it looks to wrest power after a hiatus of five years.The verdict is being seen as a reflection of the simmering public anger against inflation, primarily in the prices of fuel and other essential commodities. The much-hyped policies of the state government that have yielded little results and “misgovernance” are also being seen as the reason behind the debacle. The stakes for were high for chief minister Jai Ram Thakur as the polls were being seen as a precursor to the mood of the voters before the 2022 assembly elections.What went wrong for the saffron party?Though initially, it was the BJP’s own decisions that hurt it the most, in the later stages, ignoring the inflation issue cost it heavy. All eyes were set on the Mandi parliamentary seat, where the BJP had fielded Kargil war veteran Brig Khushal Thakur (retd) against former Lok Sabha member, Pratibha Singh, who is also the widow of six-time Himachal chief minister Virbhadra Singh. The seat, which is the home turf of CM Thakur, will now be used to gauge his ‘falling’ popularity graph. BJP tried to cash in on the army sentiments. Pratibha Singh was subjected to ruthless personal attacks over her statement on the armed forces, which she claimed had been tweaked by the BJP IT cell.Amid all the controversy, BJP tried to ignore the rising inflation and unemployment rates, which went on to harm its prospects.Irresponsible statements on these sensitive issues by the BJP leadership, including the chief minister and one of his ministers, contributed to saffron party’s ill-fate. Ultimately, the BJP, which had got a massive lead from all 17 assembly constituencies in Mandi parliamentary segment, lagged behind in nine this time. BJP couldn’t overtake the lead which the Congress got in the tribal districts of Kinnaur, Lahaul-Spiti and Pangi region of Bharmour as the lower regions didn’t vote as expected by BJP.In Fatehpur, Arki and Jubbal-Kotkhai, the infighting sank the BJP ship.BJP erred in ticket distribution in all three assembly segments. In Jubbal-Kotkhai, BJP denied ticket to Chetan Bragta despite him being active in the constituency right after the demise of his father, Narinder Singh Bragta. Bragta senior’s demise had necessitated the byelection.Also, the falling prices of apple crop was a major issue in Jubbal-Kotkhai but the state BJP leadership, including the horticulture minister Mahender Singh Thakur, and urban development minister Suresh Bhardwaj were reckless in their statements which irked the public.Chetan Bragta put up a stellar show but his silence on apple prices when he was in the BJP IT cell cost him dear. Also, Kotkhai belt did not vote as decisively as the party had expected. However, the BJP certainly learnt a lesson as its candidate couldn’t even touch the 3,000-mark and forfeited her deposit. In Arki, BJP again chose Rattan Pal Singh, ignoring a former two-time legislator Govind Ram Sharma, and paid the price. Though BJP claimed to have quelled the dissent, Sharma’s support base didn’t go with Singh.In Fatehpur, the saffron party committed the same mistake. It denied ticket to party vice-president Kripal Parmar, who had lost the previous elections by just 1,200 votes. The party fielded Baldev Thakur, who had rebelled against the party in the 2017 polls. A disgruntled Parmar and his supporters stayed away from the election campaign. Former MP Rajan Sushant, who contested as an independent, also harmed the party’s prospects here by polling nearly 13,000 votes. He mostly breached the BJP vote bank.Harish Thakur, head of the police science department of Himachal Pradesh University, said, “The Congress’ clean sweep in the byelections indicate public wrath against the BJP government and its failure to fulfill the promises. The anger was building up for long. The skyrocketing prices of essential commodities in the aftermath of rise in petrol and diesel prices added fuel to the fire. The ruling party needs to re-think its policies and their practical outcome.”In the Congress, in-charge for Himachal affairs, Rajiv Shukla had ensured smooth distribution of tickets while co incharge Sanjay Dutt had worked overnight to develope coordination in the faction-ridden CongressWhat the outcome means for BJP, Congress Though the election outcome will have no bearing on the stability of the government, this may fasten the exit of the incumbent chief minister. BJP leadership had reportedly at one point of time planned to replace him soon after the party changed chief ministers in Uttrakhand, Gujarat and Karnataka. However, the decision was put on hold till the by-elections.Also, the poll results set the alarms bells ringing for the BJP which was aiming to repeat the government in 2022.Congress, which has lost some big leaders including former chief minister Virbhadra Singh and former minister GS Bali, in the recent past, has got a shot in the arm.Such a massive victory will definitely galvanise the Congress cadres across the state. Pratibha Singh’s victory will also bring the focus back on Holy Lodge as in the next assembly elections, she would have a key role in allotment of ticket.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/himachal-bypoll-infighting-inflation-prove-bjp-s-nemesis-101635879228595.html
03-11-2021||Delhi||Deadline to apply for e-auto permits in Delhi extended to Nov 15||Transport minister Kailash Gahlot on Tuesday announced that the last date for applying for an electric auto-rickshaw permit, which ended on November 1, has now been extended to November 15. The transport department, so far, has received more than 16,000 applications for 4,261 e-auto rickshaw permits. But even though 33% — more than 1,400 permits — are reserved for women, only about 500 women have applied for permits till November 1, the government data showed. “We have extended the last date to apply for an e-auto permit till November 15. I request all those who are interested to apply within the given time period, so that we can do our best to curb pollution in Delhi. The e-auto scheme is also a means of self-employment for the youth and women of the city,” said Gahlot. The transport department also organised an “E-Auto Mela (fest)” from October 25 to 31 to spread the word about the scheme. At the exhibition, people got to see and even test drive all available models of e-autos in the Indian market. Interested persons were also advised about the best possible loan financing schemes, based on individual needs and capacity. Gahlot said the Delhi government will provide a subsidy of ₹30,000 to each new e-auto. The average cost of an e-auto will be around ₹2.7 lakh and, after subsidy, it will cost about ₹1.8 lakh, more or less the same as the price of a CNG auto in Delhi. In addition, a 5% interest relief on the loan for the purchase of the e-auto will be provided by banks that are empaneled with the Delhi government for the campaign. Currently, the city has about 95,000 registered auto-rickshaws, all of which run on CNG. There is a cap of 100,000 on the number of autos that can be registered in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/deadline-to-apply-for-e-auto-permits-in-delhi-extended-to-nov-15-101635879053145.html
03-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt stops subsidy for electric cars, to focus on two-wheelers||The Delhi government has stopped the subsidy on electric cars in the national capital and has no plans to extend the scheme any further, transport minister Kailash Gahlot said on Tuesday. Speaking to Hindustan Times, the minister said, “The electric cars segment has received the required push in Delhi. Our focus now is to tap the two-wheeler, freight and public transport segments of electric vehicles (EVs) as they constitute a major chunk of Delhi’s over 10 million registered vehicles. They also ply on the road more as compared to private cars, thereby causing more pollution.” Of the 10 million registered vehicles in Delhi, about 7.3 million are two-wheelers. On October 28, HT had reported that the Delhi government plans to only procure electric buses in the future, with an aim to increase the share of zero-emission vehicles in public transport to over 50%. According to the plan, the government will induct at least 2,300 e-buses into its fleet by the end of 2022, and upgrade all existing bus depots with EV charging infrastructure. According to the Delhi EV Policy 2020, which was notified by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)-led government on August 7 last year, the government had mandated subsidies for only 1,000 e-cars, on a first come, first served basis. Government records, seen by HT, showed that the administration has completed disbursing the subsidy to the first 1,000 e-cars and has not extended the benefit to any new e-car registered thereafter. The first 1,000 e-cars also got waivers on road tax and registration fee, in addition to a subsidy of ₹10,000 per kWh of battery capacity, with benefits being capped at ₹1.5 lakh per vehicle. For electric two-wheelers, auto-rickshaws, rickshaws and freight vehicles, the subsidy is ₹5,000 per kWh of battery capacity, with a cap of ₹30,000 per vehicle. These segments, unlike the e-cars, have no cap on the number of vehicles that can avail of the benefits, which are also being offered on a first come, first served basis. Delhi government data further showed that between August 7, 2020, and October 27, 2021, a total of 22,805 EVs were registered in the city. The total number of incentives paid out by the Delhi government so far stood at 9,633 and the total funds utilised for the purpose amounted to ₹34.31 crore. Of the 22,805 EVs registered during the above-mentioned period, 10,997 (48.2%) were e-rickshaws, followed by 5,246 electric two-wheelers (23%) and 3,845 e-carts (16.8%). Only 1,415 were e-cars and 309 were e-cabs. Overall, a total of 121,903 EVs have been registered in the city. Transport officials said there is lesser demand for electric cars/four-wheelers as compared to other EV segments owing to a lack of options in the auto market. “There are very few e-car variants that have an affordable price tag. Things may look up from next year, as auto manufacturers Tata and Hyundai are planning to introduce electric hatchback variants,” said a senior transport official, on condition of anonymity. “Actually, a subsidy is not required for e-cars as such because those who can afford to pay around ₹15 lakh for a vehicle do not care if the cost is ₹1-2 lakh more, sans the subsidy. Our aim is to provide the subsidy to those who need it the most, and they include auto drivers, two-wheeler owners, delivery partners and so on,” said Gahlot.With the Delhi government stopping its subsidy for e-cars, there will be zero subsidies in this segment as even the Centre’s FAME-II scheme cover only electric two-wheelers, three-wheelers, four-wheeled passenger vehicles and goods carrying vehicles. It does not yet offer subsidies for electric cars meant for personal use. With fuel prices touching an all-time high across the country, there has been an increased interest in electric vehicles for personal use. At present, very few variants of e-cars are available in the market and most of them are above ₹15 lakh. Tata Nexon EV ranges from ₹13.99 lakh to ₹16.85 lakh, Mahindra E-Verito costs between ₹12.67-13.03 lakh, Hyundai Kona electric ranges from ₹23.71-23.91 lakh, MG ZS EV is between ₹20.99-24.68 lakh and Mercedes Benz EQC costs around ₹1.06 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-stops-subsidy-for-electric-cars-to-focus-on-twowheelers-101635879052103.html
03-11-2021||Delhi||Protest secular, police charge sheet communal: Former JNU student Umar Khalid||Former JNU student Umar Khalid, arrested under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), on Tuesday maintained before a city court that the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protest was secular and termed the charge sheet against him “communal”. Calling it a “naked form of false implication”, senior advocate Trideep Pais, appearing for Khalid, told additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat that the charge sheet was a police’s “fertile imagination” and that the investigating officer was a scriptwriter who “literally wrote a novel”.“Not a single witness spoke that women were exploited, that there was a secular cover etc. In fact, you will see a number of personalities who are educated, working in different fields, associated with [anti-]CAA [movement]. Luckily, they were not accused. In fact, the shoe is on the other side. The protest was secular, the charge sheet is communal,” Pais argued.“You have a political person who speaks against the State and you want to frame him. It is a naked form of false implication. You (Delhi police) have fabricated a story to suit your narrative. This man is innocent. He has not done anything,” Pais submitted.Pais accused the police cooking up statements and using convenient call detail records to arrest his client. “No recovery, not present in Delhi, no violence attributed to me (Khalid), no traces of funding,” Pais pointed out.Khalid and several others have been booked under the UAPA, a stringent anti-terror law, for allegedly hatching a conspiracy to orchestrate the riots which had left at least 53 people dead and over 700 injured.He also said that had the Delhi Police been a fair investigating agency, it would not have attributed the “tukde-tukde” phrase from some other case’s charge sheet to the present one.Dismissing allegations that Khalid directed JNU student Sharjeel Imam and others to block the roads at Shaheen Bagh, the senior counsel argued that while the prosecution equated the blockades to a terror act, “it is not an offence and has been used by students, farmers and other agitations”.Besides Khalid, JNU students Natasha Narwal, Devangana Kalita, Jamia Coordination Committee member Safoora Zargar, former AAP councilor Tahir Hussain and several others have been booked for conspiracy in fuelling the riots.Delhi Police had earlier said the bail plea had no merit and that it will demonstrate the prima facie case against him before the court by referring to the charge sheet filed in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/protest-secular-police-charge-sheet-communal-former-jnu-student-umar-khalid-101635878868070.html
03-11-2021||Delhi||Crackers or not, Diwali to plunge air into ‘very poor’ range in Delhi||If no firecrackers will go off on Diwali, the air quality in Delhi will stay in the very poor range; but may slip into the severe range if half of the crackers burst during 2019 were used, according to two scenarios projected by the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (Safar) for spike in pollution expected on November, the day the festival of lights will be celebrated.To be sure, the Delhi government has imposed a complete ban on the sale, storage and use of firecrackers until January 1, 2022. Each year, bursting of crackers coupled with local and external pollution sources such as stubble fires cause a spike in air pollution on Diwali.The Safar forecasts mentioned that northwesterlies will bring in heavy load of pollutants from farm fires in Punjab and Haryana November 4 onwards, and their contribution in total pollution mix of Delhi may go up to 40%.The analysis, part of Safar’s Diwali forecast, said stubble burning coupled with likely bursting of firecrackers may push air quality in Delhi into the ‘severe’ category (average AQI of 400 or above) for the first time this winter season on the day of Diwali. It may stay in the same zone the next day too, the agency said, and added that a slight improvement can only be expected November 6 onwards. “We have identified three factors which could play a role around Diwali – number of farm fires touching 4,000 with an overall contribution of 40% on November 5, calm local winds over Delhi and the third is how many firecrackers are burst. If no firecrackers are used, Delhi’s air will be ‘very poor’, but even if some firecrackers are added, the air could be pushed to the ‘severe’ range,” said Gufran Beig, founder and project director at Safar.Environment Gopal Rai on Tuesday said that the Delhi government has given directions to increase vigilance across Delhi to check the sale, purchase and burning of firecrackers. Rai said till Tuesday, 12,957 kgs of crackers had been seized by the Delhi Police and 32 people have been booked during the anti-cracker campaign from October 27 onwards.“A special vigilance campaign would be run in the areas on Delhi’s border with other states so that people could not bring in crackers from other states and prevent illegal no purchase, sale, movement, and storage of firecrackers anywhere. In this context, instructions have been issued to Delhi Police and SDMs on behalf of the DPCC (Delhi Pollution Control Committee) today,” said Rai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/crackers-or-not-diwali-to-plunge-air-into-very-poor-range-in-delhi-101635878809543.html
03-11-2021||Chandigarh||Fire safety: Mohali MC sets deadline for factories||After issuing notices to around 160 units for fire-safety violations at the Industrial Area, Phase 8B, the Mohali municipal corporation has now set the deadline of November 30 for them to comply with the directions or face sealing of the premises. “In September, around 160 notices were issued to industrial unit owners to get no-objection certificates from the fire department. Now we have set a deadline of November 30. We will be sealing the units that fail to comply with safety norms,” said MC commissioner Kamal Kumar Garg. Even in February this year, 600 notices were slapped on violators across the district, with an ultimatum of 15 days. However, eight months later, no violating structure has been sealed. In fact, the corporation has been following this exercise for the past three years, but has not penalised a single violator yet.Through a survey last year, the fire department had identified various properties, including high-rise buildings and commercial establishments that did not comply with fire-safety norms. The violations included the presence of a single entry and exit point, which could be dangerous in case of an emergency. Among other issues, fire extinguishers were missing on many floors and those available did not have an ISI mark. Hose reels, smoke detection alarm system, and illuminated exit signs were also found missing in most buildings. Meanwhile, most showrooms in markets had loose electricity wiring. At several industrial units and housing societies, there was no underground static water storage tank of 75,000-litre capacity with pump, as required under fire-safety rules. Terrace water tanks with at least 10,000-litre capacity were also found missing. The absence of a fire control room and emergency lifts with firemen switch was among other violations. A factory manufacturing cardboard boxes was gutted at the Industrial Area, Phase 8B, in March 2019, leading to the destruction of machinery and products worth crores. In March last year, a fire broke out at a multi-brand retail store in Phase 5, turning readymade clothes worth lakhs into ashes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/fire-safety-mohali-mc-sets-deadline-for-factories-to-comply-101635878808208.html
03-11-2021||Delhi||Despite ban, crackers make their presence felt in Delhi||In spite of a ban on the sale and use of firecrackers, a black market has sprung up in various parts of the national Capital, a spot check by HT correspondents found, in what could allow people to violate the restrictions on Diwali and trigger an air pollution crisis.In at least six localities, HT’s correspondents were told by people ranging from local shop owners to auto-rickshaw drivers that they could help procure firecrackers and deliver them at the doorstep to minimise the risk of being caught. In two of these places, the people allowed the stocks to be inspected for purchase.Firecrackers have been banned in entirety by the Delhi government, and an older ban by National Green Tribunal (and endorsed by the Supreme Court) bans the sale and use of ones made with barium-based formulations in the National Capital Region (NCR). The ones without barium are known as green firecrackers, but their certification and veracity has been difficult to determine.In the week leading to Diwali, which is on Thursday, both types of firecrackers were available at multiple spots that HT visited: Kabir Nagar, Rohini, Ghazipur, Bhalswa, Tilak Nagar, and Munirka.In Kabir Nagar, an auto driver offered to get boxes of green varieties of “anar, phuljhari, and rockets” for a commission. The price quoted by the driver for two boxes each anar (flowerpots), two boxes of phuljhari (sparkles) and one box of rockets eventually came to ₹4,580 and the driver insisted on upfront payment. “I can deliver it to your house but you will have to pay the full amount in cash right away,” the driver said, asking not to be identified, before showing some samples.In Rajouri Garden, two men approached HT’s correspondents after they made enquiries about where firecrackers could be bought. The two made their way to a small grocery store where the shopkeeper said the items will be home delivered “the next day” with an option of paying later. The shopkeeper showed some samples and a handwritten rate card, but was not able to say if the firecrackers that he would deliver were of the “green” variety. The samples shown were in green packaging but did not carry any verifiable barcode comes with the CSIR-National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri) certification for green firecrackers.“What is Diwali without a few crackers? The government has completely finished Diwali,” he said.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on September 15 announced a complete ban on firecrackers till January 1, citing the annual deterioration of air quality crisis that happens during winter. On Tuesday, the air quality index entered the red ‘very poor’ zone for the first time and an analysis by government experts said that even if 50% of the amount of firecrackers burst in 2019 is used this year, air pollution levels will shoot up to ‘severe’.The ban on all firecrackers has been opposed by traders. A group of over 50 licensed firecracker sellers moved the Delhi high court against the ban on Monday, although their plea was turned down. Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva, while hearing the plea by traders seeking permission to sell the so-called green firecrackers in line with the NGT order, was told by the Delhi government its officials have seized over 11,000 kg of firecrackers till October 24 this year.“We are keeping a close watch on the instances sale, storage and use of crackers. But it has come to our notice that cracker bursting is being reported in some parts of the city over the last two weeks. The problem is that Delhi is a small city and because of its porous borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, it becomes easier for people to get access to these banned items. Since there are no such bans in these states, implementation of the ban in Delhi becomes a little challenging,” said a senior environment department official, asking not to be named.A seller at the Gold Star Patakha Godam in Gurugram said that the sale of green firecrackers was allowed in Haryana. “We are not doing anything illegal. Firecrackers are allowed here. If someone from Delhi is buying from here, that becomes their problem and the problem of the authorities there,” he said, asking not to be named.Delhi Police officers said that their action was largely dependent on intelligence inputs, manual checking of legal as well as illegal shops and warehouses, and of vehicles crossing in from Delhi’s borders.“We have the list of permanent as well as temporary firecracker vendors because they either hold licences or apply for one before Diwali. Keeping a vigil on them or their stocks is easy. But when people run an illegal business just during the festival, it becomes difficult. The only way we can catch such new players is either through intelligence inputs or manual checking. Checking every individual at the border is a tedious task,” said a senior police officer, who did not want to be named.According to police officers, all police personnel on duty across the city have been directed to enforce the ban and carry out a “massive crackdown” on people involved in the illegal sale and use of crackers.“We have held several meetings with market welfare associations and shopkeepers to update them about the guidelines on crackers and the legal actions they may face if found violating the orders. Apart from the regular policing, police personnel in plain clothes are also carrying out surprise checks,” said Sagar Singh Kalsi, deputy commissioner of police (north), adding that 17 people have been arrested in seven cases in which nearly 1,700 banned crackers have been seized by the north district police.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment, said Delhi cannot implement a successful firecracker ban because of close proximity and easy access in neighbouring states.“We have seen over the last few years that Delhi’s first big smog spell happens right after Diwali and this is primarily because of cracker bursting. The government has been implementing a ban but the impact will only come with large-scale public awareness and enforcement,” she said, before adding that unless a ban is implemented in NCR towns, illegal trade and firecracker bursting instances are likely to continue..Resident Welfare Associations (RWA) also agreed that the sale and purchase of firecrackers were happening discreetly in their areas.“The sale and purchase are definitely happening, but these bans should not be imposed because ultimately the religious sentiments of people are involved. What the government can do is educate people about the impact of bursting firecrackers and how it adversely affects our health. Ultimately, we are all dying breathing this polluted air. Once that awareness comes, people will stop bursting crackers themselves,” said BS Vohra, president of East Delhi RWAs Joint Front.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/despite-ban-crackers-make-their-presence-felt-in-delhi-101635878570750.html

03-11-2021||Chandigarh||Panchkula: Three workers killed in fire at furniture factory||Three workers, including two women, died while another is battling for life after a fire broke out at a three-storeyed furniture factory in the Industrial Area, Phase 2, Panchkula, on Tuesday. While the authorities pointed to suspected fire-safety violations at the unit, the owner blamed the deaths on the delay in the fire department’s response.The fire erupted at West Wood furniture factory past noon and took around 40 firemen over seven hours to bring it under control. Deputy commissioner of police (DCP) Mohit Handa confirmed the death of three factory workers. They have been identified as Mamta, 45; Sonali Devi, 30; and Avdesh Kumar, 20. Another worker whose details are not known is hospitalised with severe burn injuries.One fireman hurt tooFire officer Tarsem said they got a call regarding the blaze at 1:52pm and rushed seven fire tenders from Sector 5, Sector 20, Kalka and Barwala to the spot within minutes. Till evening, around 30 water tankers had been deployed.“Since it was a furniture factory and the entire material was combustible, it made things more difficult. The firemen had to break the glass because of which one of the men got slightly injured as well,” said the official.The fire started from the first floor and spread to the second floor. While other workers managed to escape, four were trapped. “We removed one dead body and evacuated three injured persons from the factory,” the fire officer said. However, by the evening, two of the three had succumbed to their burn injuries.Though the flames had been doused by late evening, the gutted goods were still smouldering and huge plumes of smoke were billowing from the building. Cause to be investigatedDCP Mohit Handa, who visited the spot, said: “It is too early to state the cause of fire. We are still gathering facts and our teams are still at the spot. Once the operation ends, we will turn our focus to finding out the cause behind this massive fire. Forensic teams are also present at the spot and will carry out a detailed investigation.”While the fire officer also refrained from sharing the cause behind fire, he said: “The preliminary visit to the spot shows that there are some fire-safety violations. A detailed investigation will be conducted on Wednesday.”Firemen were late: OwnerMeanwhile, West Wood owner Arjun Kakkar alleged that the fire brigade was at least an hour late in reaching the spot, which led to the death of three workers.Kakkar said the factory had all fire-fighting equipment and facilities in place, but it was not enough to control the massive blaze and a call was made to the emergency number 112 promptly.“The fire broke out at 12:30pm, whereas the first fire tender reached the spot at least 50 minutes late. By the time they reached, the fire had spread from the first to second floor. Their system is so lackadaisical that once water in the first tender got over, they started waiting for the second one before resuming the rescue operation,” he alleged.Panchkula MLA Gian Chand Gupta also the visited the factory, where family members of the deceased pleaded him for help and justice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/panchkula-three-workers-killed-in-fire-at-furniture-factory-101635878510740.html

03-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Woman falls from cycle rickshaw during snatching bid in Dilshad Garden||New Delhi: A 22-year-old woman working with a private company in Noida suffered injuries to her knees and hands as she fell from a moving cycle rickshaw while trying to fight off two bike-borne men who allegedly snatched her phone on a busy road in northeast Delhi’s Dilshad Garden on Sunday morning. The incident, which is the latest in a series of snatching cases in which the victims suffered fatal or serious injuries, is the second such crime reported in the city in the last 10 days.According to Delhi Police data, the city reported 5,108 snatching cases till August 15 this year -- 851 more than what was reported during the same period in 2020. Statistics show that at least one person became a victim of snatching every hour, and at least one robbery was reported every four hours in Delhi till August 15.On October 22, a 41-year-old woman from Darjeeling fractured her collarbone, and her 48-year-old friend and the driver of the autorickshaw they were travelling in suffered injuries after the vehicle overturned as she tried to fight off two men on a bike who snatched her phone on the Sarai Kale Khan flyover in south Delhi. In the latest case on Sunday, the woman, Lovely Gupta, left her Dilshad Garden home and boarded a cycle rickshaw to head to Jhilmil Metro station, from where she was supposed to board a Metro train to reach her office in Noida. She was near Sai Chowk in Dilshad Garden, nearly half a kilometre away from home -- when the snatchers targeted her around 7.30am.In her complaint to the station house officer (SHO), Gupta said the two men came on a bike from behind and started riding next to the rickshaw. “Suddenly, the pillion rider tried to snatch my phone. I was shocked by the sudden attack and tried to defend myself. But he pulled me by force, snatched my phone and sped away. Meanwhile, I fell on the road and yelled for help, but no one came to my aid,” said Gupta in her complaint filed on Monday, a day after the incident.Gupta’s mother, Radha, said that a gym trainer who was passing by stopped and helped her daughter. She used his phone to call the police, but left before they arrived as she had to rush to her office for an important meeting, her mother said.“My daughter also informed us about the incident using the gym trainer’s phone. When she returned home in the night, I asked her about her injuries and if she had visited any hospital. She had suffered injuries to her knees and hands. Her pair of jeans was also torn near the knees because of the fall... My daughter told me that she had taken medical attention at the office itself,” said Radha.Deputy commissioner of police (Shahdara) R Sathiyasundaram said that a police team reached the crime scene immediately after the call. Not finding the victim there, the police dialled the mobile number from which she had made the call and was informed that the victim had borrowed the phone.The next day, Gupta filed a complaint at the GTB Enclave police station. “We immediately converted her complaint into a first information report (FIR) and formed teams to identify and nab the suspects. We are contacting the complainant again to ask for her medical examination so that the nature of her injuries can be ascertained. Our teams are scanning the CCTV footage from near the crime scene. In one footage, the suspects are seen wearing helmets and riding a black bike,” said DCP Sathiyasundaram.In her complaint, Gupta said claimed that the streets have become unsafe: “It seems such miscreants have no fear of the local police. To avoid such situations, I never walk on the road and always hire a rickshaw, but we are not safe even then. I request you to kindly take note of my complaint and do your best to get hold of these culprits and my phone so that girls like me get some sense of security.”In a series on street crimes in Delhi in March, HT reported that most snatchers in the city are unemployed, illiterate or school drop-outs. Snatching is considered a gateway crime to more serious offences.Analysis of police data shows that of the snatchers arrested in 2020, almost 43.71% (2,840) were illiterate or school drop-outs (did not clear Class 5). In fact, only 10 of the arrested had graduate degrees. The data also showed that mobile phones were the most common item snatched — at least 71% (5,655) of the cases -- followed by gold jewellery (15% cases).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwoman-falls-from-cycle-rickshaw-during-snatching-bid-in-dilshad-garden-101635878448037.html
03-11-2021||Pune||Marathwada farmers seek odd jobs in Pune’s cracker industry||PUNE: With excessive rainfall and flash floods having destroyed farmlands, over 2,000 farm labourers from Marathwada have been forced to come to Pune in search of employment in its cracker selling industry. Most of them are now working as porters, cashiers and salesmen at some of the biggest cracker-selling outlets in Golibar maidan, Wanowrie and Kothrud among others.Gokul Koli, a salesman at a cracker-selling shop in Golibar maidan hails from the Latur district. “I have to look after my parents, wife and three children. I used to till the field and get paid by the farmer. But this year, my employer incurred huge losses due to the rains and relieved me from my work. There are no jobs available as I am uneducated. Through one of my contacts in Pune, I decided to visit the city and seek employment to support my family.”According to the trader community, Marathwada, which typically faces water shortage throughout the year, saw unprecedented rain at the time of withdrawal of the monsoon forcing many farmers and farm labourers to move out of the region in search of odd jobs to support their families.Farmer Atul Patil said that he used to cultivate soybean and basic pulses on his farm but the recent heavy rain destroyed his cultivation completely leading to huge losses. “One of my relatives is already working here in Pune and he helped me get the job. I will earn Rs15,000 to Rs20,000 in a month which will help me and my family,” he said.Santosh Bora - owner of Pune’s oldest cracker outlet, Bansilal Phataka mart and president of Shobhechi Daru Utpadak Kharidi Vikri Sahakari Sangh, a Pune-based umbrella organisation of firecracker outlets (registered in 1961) - has been helping distressed persons from the region. “Annually, 1,500 to 2,000 unemployed people usually come to Pune after Dussehra and work at temporary outlets set up during the festive season. But this year, over 2,000 people have come from Marathwada. Our organisation has decided to accommodate every person who arrives and has also made arrangements for food and shelter for the entire month. These people work very hard and are loyal and trustworthy. Since the local labour force is absent, we depend on them completely. Most of them are employed by traders because of their honesty and hard work,” Bora said.Sanjay Waghmare, a worker from Ausa in Latur said, “There is no work available at home and we have loans to pay and we have to support our families. The cracker traders provide all the necessary help to us and ensure that our stay is comfortable. This Diwali is an opportunity to do hard work and wipe-off debts,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/marathwada-farmers-seek-odd-jobs-in-pune-s-cracker-industry-101635878387996.html
03-11-2021||Delhi||Traffic crawls in Delhi as people throng roads for shopping on Dhanteras||Long traffic jams were seen across the national capital on the occasion of Dhanteras on Tuesday, as commuters thronged the roads for festival shopping. Delhi traffic police officials said that on several arterial roads, vehicles moved at a snail’s pace, doubling the travel time as compared to regular days. Senior traffic police officials said that while higher traffic volume was observed in many parts of the Capital on Tuesday morning, the situation got worse in the evening. They said that the snarls were particularly bad around major markets, where haphazardly parked vehicles ate up road space. “We had anticipated higher traffic volume today (Tuesday) because of the Dhanteras festival rush, so we deployed additional traffic officials to direct vehicles. We had teams that were specially assigned for markets to ensure that there was no crowding. We were also checking illegal parking, which usually becomes a reason for traffic jams,” said a senior traffic police official.Information received from the traffic police’s control room showed that the worst affected stretches on Tuesday were Green Park, Ring Road around Lajpat Nagar, near Hyatt Hotel (around Sarojini Nagar market), Outer Ring Road near Vasant Vihar, Rajouri Garden (near the Metro station), Ashram intersection, Lala Lajpat Rai Road, Sardar Patel Marg towards Dhaula Kuan, ITO crossing, Shankar Road, Nangloi Chowk, Dwarka Link Road, Pankha Road, and Raghubir Nagar. Other areas that saw crawling traffic on Tuesday were areas near the Chattrasal Stadium, Ashok Vihar, Old Rohtak Road, Moolchand, and Mehrauli-Badarpur Road. Many commuters took to social media to complain about traffic mismanagement. They also complained about unmanned barricades placed by the Delhi Police, especially around roads leading up to markets and shopping malls, which they claimed made the traffic jams worse. “To cover a 100-metre distance from Savitri Cinema to Greater Kailash-II, it took me 45 minutes. There were no traffic policemen to be seen on the roads,” tweeted Sanjay Singh, a commuter. Another commuter, Subodh Singh also complained about traffic personnel not being seen on the roads. “Rajender Nagar crossing was totally out of control and no traffic policeman is seen,” he said. A senior traffic official said that traffic jams are expected across the city on Wednesday as well, adding that additional police personnel will be deployed to manage potential bottlenecks.“Diwali last year had many restrictions, but this time we are expecting jams to be more than usual. The restrictions on the Delhi Metro will also impact traffic on roads. However, we are doing our best to manage the situation, but we would also like to request people to not plan their shopping trips during the peak hours of the evening. If they can, they should travel after the office rush hours in the morning or before the rush starts again in the evening hours,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/traffic-crawls-in-delhi-as-people-throng-roads-for-shopping-on-dhanteras-101635878327960.html

The robot is being hailed as the tallest e-waste sculpture in the country, officials said.The 30’ ft tall ‘ROBO’ weighs 3 tonnes and has been made out of PCB, printer, printer cartridge, RAM, keyboard, mouse, monitor, mobile, CD player, TV and VCR by the trainees from electrician, electronics and painter trade of the institute. The e-waste for the robot was collected from Berhampur city.Dr Rajat Kumar Panigrahy, principal, ITI, Berhampur, said through the sculpture, students at ITI Berhampur are urging people to reconnect with Mother Earth by being responsible in the scientific management of e-waste.“As e-waste generation is very high in the current age and they comprise many toxic elements, including copper, liquid crystal, lithium, mercury, nickel, selenium, arsenic and barium, the robo is an effort to spread awareness among the people for environmental protection and proper management of e-waste. When e-waste is not properly managed, the risks of air and water pollution become significantly higher,” said Panigrahy.Last year, an open-air scrap sculpture park in the same institute made it to the Asia Book of Records with the book declaring it as the largest open-air scrap sculpture park in Asia. The scrap sculpture park in ITI Berhampur spread over 10000 square metres has 20 sculptures, ranging between 7 ft and 70 ft.Some of the exhibits in the park include Giant Guitar, Iron Man, Terminator, Dolphin, Turtle, Helicopter, Chetak, Predator, Spotted Deer, Robot, Reindeer, Lizard, Peacock, Huge Cow, King Kong, Fishing Lure, Tank, Hanging Fish and Giraffe.Last year, the Odisha government streamlined the collection of e-waste across all municipal bodies by designating Saturday as the day when e-waste would be collected. While wet and dry waste is collected on all other days, e-waste is collected on Saturdays.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/odisha-students-create-30-ft-tall-robo-out-of-ewaste-101635878209196.html
03-11-2021||Delhi||Jawaharlal Nehru University VC appointed 9 without authority: Delhi HC||The vice chancellor (VC) of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) does not have the authority to appoint the chairpersons of the centres or special centres, the Delhi high court has said while restraining nine people appointed by VC M Jagadesh Kumar from taking any decisions in their official capacity.“We are prima facie of the view that respondent no.2 (VC) is not vested with the power to appoint Chairpersons of Centres/Special Centres. The statute confers the power of appointment on the Executive Council. Thus, clearly the appointment of Chairpersons of Centres/Special Centres by respondent no.2 is, as is evident at this stage, prima facie, without authority,” a bench of justices Rajiv Shakdher and Talwant Singh said in an order of October 26 that was uploaded on the court website on Tuesday. The court, while hearing a plea by a professor, challenging the Executive Council’s approval to the nine professors appointed by the VC as chairpersons of different centres, also said that the VC can only exercise such powers only in ‘emergent situations’, according to the university statute. Professor Atul Sood had approached the court on September 26, challenging the September 2 approval granted by the executive council to the nine appointments made by the Vice Chancellor in July. Sood, through his counsel, Abhik Chimni, had contended that the VC did not have the powers to appoint the chairpersons of the various centres, including the Centre for Political Studies, Centre for Media Studies and Centre for Historical Studies. Appearing for the varsity, central government standing counsel Monica Arora, contended that the VC exercised his power under the statute of the university. She also argued that since, from time to time, the centres require appointment of chairperson(s), the power is exercised by the vice chancellor which is, thereafter, ratified by the Executive Council.However, the court rejected the Centre’s argument and said that the VC can exercise such powers only when immediate action is required “on account of an emergent situation”, which then is reported to the concerned authority for obtaining its approval.The court also noted that the petitioner objected to the agenda for the 296th meeting of the executive council on September 2, and informed that the council ignored a letter by petitioner raising objections to the appointment, and ratified them. The court further said that after a single bench of the high court on September 28 refused to stay the nine appointments made by the VC, the VC went ahead with the appointment of another person as chairperson of Centre of Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and Latin American Studies under the School of Language, Literature & Cultural Studies on October 8, again exercising the emergency powers vested in him.The bench restrained the chairpersons from making any decision and said, “Pending decision in the writ petition, the nine (9) chairpersons, who have been appointed…will not take any major decisions, including functions relating to convening of selection committees and/or carrying out selection(s), concerning the centres/special centres”.The court also asked the single judge, before whom the challenge to the appointment is pending, to advance the hearing of Sood’s plea and posted the matter for hearing on November 10.The JNU vice-chancellor did not respond to repeated queries, seeking a comment. The union education ministry on January 22 allowed Jagadesh Kumar, whose term was going to end on January 26, to continue in his position “until further orders”.Kumar’s tenure as JNU VC had been marked by several protests and controversies, including the 2016 sedition row, and protests on hostel fee hike which was followed by an attack on campus by a masked mob in January 2020, which had left several students and teachers injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/jawaharlal-nehru-university-vc-appointed-9-without-authority-delhi-hc-101635878090028.html
03-11-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: Industrialists up in arms over rising prices of raw materials||Raising a hue and cry over rising inflation and unprecedented rise in prices of steel, nickel and other raw material, members of different industrial associations started an indefinite protest against the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) led Union government outside the office of United Cycle and Parts Manufacturers Association (UCPMA) on Tuesday. They demanded the formation of a regulatory commission at the national level to bring down the prices.With the assembly elections scheduled for next year, the industrialists carried placards and raised the slogans stating that they will only vote for the party which fulfils their demand. They stated that an hour-long protest will be staged outside the UCPMA office everyday till their demand is met.Representatives of industrial associations including UCPMA, Federation of Industrial and Commercial Organisation (FICO), Bicycle Research and Development Organisation (BRADO) and Sewing Machine Association participated in the protest.The industrialists stated that the prices of steel have increased by around 35% in the last two months and the skyrocketing prices of fuel and other raw materials have taken a toll on the sector. Former president of UCPMA Charanjit Vishwakarma and FICO president Gurmeet Kular stated that the industry, especially the MSME sector, will not be able to survive the frequent and unprecedented rise in prices.

There is no official permission for this fare hike and RTO has warned against overcharging. Last week, the association at a state-level general body meeting in Pune announced the hike. “We have not yet given authorisation or any kind of permission for the fare hike by the private bus and cars’ association. None of the passengers should be charged fares higher than the criteria of the state government. If we get any complaints regarding overcharging, then action will be taken on the bus and car owners,” said Ajit Shinde, Pune regional transport officer. At the annual general body meeting of the association last week, 500 representatives from across the state were present at Siddhi Gardens near Mhatre bridge. There are 16,000 small and big buses in Pune and 1,000 bus and car owners are who are association members. “For the last 19 months these vehicles were stopped due to the pandemic and there was no business. So already we are facing a financial crisis and top of that now the diesel hike. So to repair, maintain and sustain our vehicles this decision of a rate fare hike was taken,” said Rajan Junavane, president of the association. “Despite the Diwali festive season there is not much business, apart from that school buses and buses for the IT companies are at a standstill for the last two years. In such a difficult situation we are not left with any other option than to increase the fares,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/rto-warns-of-strict-action-if-private-bus-taxi-owners-hike-fares-101635878028765.html

03-11-2021||Delhi||Snag at Delhi automated parking lot causes 4 platforms to collapse||Four platforms of an automated tower parking facility in Green Park collapsed on Tuesday evening, allegedly due to a technical fault, damaging two vehicles, the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC), which runs the facility, said, adding that no one was injured in the mishap. Deputy commissioner of police (south) Benita Mary Jaikar said information was received at the Hauz Khas police station about electrically operated floor plates (that shift the cars) collapsing at the multilevel parking facility, damaging a few cars. “No injury or casualty was reported. The parking has been blocked and no entry is permitted until a complete technical inspection is carried out,” she said. While no one has been injured, the first such accident at an automated parking facility has raised questions about the safety and maintenance of these lots. Users whose vehicles got stuck inside also posed questions about the safety of their vehicles. “My vehicle is worth ₹21 lakh and it is now stuck at the facility. How can I go home and sleep? Who will guarantee the safety of our vehicles?” a parking user said, asking not to be named.South corporation officials attempted to downplay the incident and said only two vehicles sustained “minor damages”. Inderjeet Sehrawat, leader of the house, said a fault occurred in the automated facility as a result of which some of the electrical floor plates “got bent and caused minor damage to one vehicle”. “No one has been injured and the incident is being exaggerated by the Aam Aadmi Party. We will rectify the situation,” he said. A senior SDMC official from the engineering department said maintenance work was being carried out at the parking lot on Tuesday, during which a snag seems to have occurred and the empty platforms (used to move vehicles) collided. “The four platforms that collided were empty. Two cars have sustained minor damages. The operation and maintenance of the parking facility are carried out by a private operator. Prima facie, it appears that a few plates malfunctioned. There is no manual interference in the automated parking and so no one was injured. We will operationalise the lift at night,” the official said, asking not to be named. Prem Chauhan, leader of the opposition in the SDMC, said the collapse shows that corruption has taken place in the project. “Who will compensate the people whose cars were damaged? The officials concerned and BJP leaders should be held accountable,” he said. AAP MLA Somnath Bharti said the accident reflects the scale of corruption in the municipal body. “A big disaster has been averted. What would have happened if anyone was standing near the collapsed platforms? A probe should be carried out into this collapse,” he said.SDMC mayor Mukesh Suryan said a probe has been ordered. “The facility was opened in November 2020 and it has been operating smoothly till now. A technical problem occurred in one of the towers on the eighth floor due to which one plate fell. No one has been injured and no damage to property has occurred. Officials are present on the site and the facility will be re operationalized at night,” he said.Built with an estimated cost of ₹18.20 crore, the automated tower parking facility in Green Park consists of two towers. The first tower was inaugurated by Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri in January 2020 while the second tower was opened by Union minister RK Singh in November 2020. The 17-storey facility is 39.5 metres high and is spread over an area of 878 square metres. It was the first automated tower parking facility in the city and the two towers can accommodate 136 cars at a stretch. The SDMC has planned several such automated parking projects in the areas of GK1, GK2, Amar Colony, Nizamuddin, Punjabi Bagh and Sarai Kale Khan. Three automated parking projects have been opened in Green Park, Lajpat Nagar and Adhchini. The Adhchini facility was inaugurated just nine days ago, on October 24, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/snag-at-delhi-automated-parking-lot-causes-4-platforms-to-collapse-2-cars-damaged-101635877852316.html

Addressing a press conference at the party’s office in Gian Singh Rarewala market, the district unit of AAP demanded that the allowance be transferred into the accounts of unemployed youths starting from 2017, when the Congress government was formed in the state. AAP leaders including district president Suresh Goyal, Daljit (Bhola) Grewal and Kulwant Sidhu said that the Congress government befooled the public during the 2017 elections and have failed to perform at the ground level in the last 4.5 years. They added that the unemployed youth is being pushed towards drugs, as they don’t have jobs to make ends meet. Grewal demanded that the state government should also fix atleast 80% quota for the youth of the state in private sector jobs, as it has been done by neighbouring states. Also, the upper age limit for police recruitment exam should be removed, as the exam has been delayed for a long time and many of the applicants have now become overage, he added.Cong patronising transport mafia: AAPCiting a private bus parked near the party office, AAP leaders slammed transport minister Amarinder Singh Raja Warring over his alleged failure in tightening the noose around transport mafia. The owner of the bus, Sukhjinder Singh, however claimed to have a valid permit and accused the AAP leaders of defaming him.AAP leader Ashok Prashar Pappi stated that private bus operators are operating without paying fees to the government and are fleecing the public.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/aap-slams-punjab-govt-over-rising-unemployment-101635877849510.html

Earlier this year, the government issued public notices announcing that it has resumed.Under the scheme, students can avail free coaching at 46 empanelled private coaching centres -- and, under special provisions, some non-empanelled centres too -- for a wide range of competitive exams including UPSC, CDS, banking exams, medical and engineering entrances, prominent law university entrances and management school exams.In 2018, when the scheme was open only for SC/ST students, around 5,000 students enrolled. The next year witnessed enrolment of 15,000 students after the scheme was opened for OBC and EWS students, said Gautam.“Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s resolve to uplift the poorest of poor students gets strength... Under the Jai Bhim Mukhyamantri Pratibha Vikas Yojana (scheme), meritorious students belonging to SC/ST/OBC and EWS categories receive free coaching from private institutes for competitive exams,” said the minister.He further said, “It is the dream of CM Arvind Kejriwal that even the poorest of poor kids who want to become someone prominent receive assistance and support in fulfilling their dreams. If a kid from a family earning less than ₹8 lakh per annum is talented, they will no longer have to face the hurdles of poverty, the Kejriwal government will provide them free coaching. Other than tuition fees, we will also provide a stipend of ₹2,500 to the beneficiary students so that they do not face problems in their commute.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/15k-students-enrolled-under-delhi-govt-s-free-coaching-scheme-this-yearminister-101635877247756.html

Section 50 of the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) provides for the right to be searched in the presence of a gazetted officer or a magistrate. The FIR in the case was registered on January 22 at Kundli police station in Sonepat. The search in the case was done by the police party, which made the seizure and a magistrate or a gazetted officer was not involved. “No doubt, notice under Section 50 of the NDPS Act mentions the petitioner having been apprised of his rights, but the said notice is absolutely silent as to what rights were apprised to the petitioner, as also whether he was apprised of his right under Section 50 of NDPS Act, which to be searched in the presence of a magistrate or a gazetted officer. The said notice merely mentions the petitioner having been informed of his rights as also the option if he so desired to get his search conducted by a magistrate or gazetted officer,” the bench of justice BS Walia said, granting bail to the accused. The bench added that merely informing the accused that he had rights under the NDPS Act, without specifying what rights the accused had would not constitute compliance with the mandatory requirement under Section 50 sub-section (1) of the Act. “This not being complied with, and considering the strict punishment provided for an offence under the NDPS Act, the failure to comply with Section 50 of the NDPS Act renders the recovery of the illicit article suspect,” the bench added.‘NOT SEARCHED IN PRESENCE OF GAZETTED OFFICER’The court was hearing a bail plea from one Sunil. He, along with Mukdar, Arvind and Vikas were travelling in a car and 803gm of powder alleged to be heroin (commercial quantity) was seized by the Haryana Police. The accused had argued before court that since he was not informed of his right to be searched in the presence of a gazetted officer or a magistrate, there was non-compliance of Section 50 of the NDPS Act. Hence, he be granted bail.However, a consent memo was taken stating that he agreed for the search and that he was informed of the rights at the time of the search. The court had found that the accused was apprised of his rights, but the notice was silent as to what rights he was apprised of to conduct the search. The government counsel argued the petitioner was informed, of the apprehension of the police that he had some intoxicating material and that he was given option to get his search conducted by a magistrate or gazetted officer and there was due compliance with the mandate of NDPS Act. However, the court observed that in this case the requirement under Section 50 NDPS Act was not merely a technical breach.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/800gm-heroin-seizure-in-haryana-not-informed-properly-of-rights-during-search-hc-grants-bail-101635876648932.html

Officials of the district administration said that they have formed a committee, comprising a subdivisional magistrate, an assistant commissioner of police and members of religious organisations and civil society groups to hold a discussion on the issue. A meeting in this regard is likely to take place on Wednesday morning and a decision on prayer sites are likely to be taken, officials said.A release issued by the district administration on Tuesday stated, “It has been decided to form a committee comprising all the stakeholders which will discuss the matter with all communities to resolve the issue. It will be ensured that local residents don’t face any trouble due to this practice. It will also be ensured that no road or public place is designated as a site for offering prayers. The committee will also take consent from locals at the time of designating a spot for offering prayers.”Yash Garg, deputy commissioner, Gurugram said that all stakeholders are being engaged to resolve the matter peacefully. “Hectic discussions and meetings are being held daily with members of both Hindu and Muslim communities to resolve this issue peacefully. The proposed committee will engage with all stakeholders and finalise a solution that is acceptable to everyone. It has been agreed by both sides that ensuring peace and brotherhood in the city will remain their priority. The matter will be resolved through consensus in the next few days,” Garg said. According to a statement issued by the Gurugram police, permission for eight sites were withdrawn and a decision on the remaining sites will be taken by the committee. The eight designated sites for which permissions were withdrawn are located in Bengali Basti in Sector 49, V Block of DLF Phase-3, Surat Nagar Phase-1, outskirts of Kherki Majra village, outskirts of Daulatabad village near Dwarka Expressway, near Ramgarh village in Sector 68, near DLF Square Tower and Rampur village, in the direction of Nakhrola Road.Officials of the district administration said that the committee will ensure that namaz is offered at mosques or designated sites decided by consensus. It also directed that permission from the administration is required to offer namaz in an open or public place. They also called upon both Hindu and Muslim organisations to work in a coordinated manner to ensure peace in the city. On Monday, representatives of the Muslim groups and Haryana Waqf Board stated that they would refrain from offering namaz at sites where the public objected to the same and asked that the administration clear encroachments on 19 land parcels of the Waqf Board. Meanwhile, members of the Sanyukt Hindu Sangarsh Samiti, a Hindu organisation that has been protesting the practice, held a meeting with the district administration on Tuesday and reiterated their demand for ending the practice. “Our only submission to the district administration is that prayers should not be held in the open,” said Kulbhushan Bhardwaj, legal advisor of the Samiti. Mahavir Bhardwaj, the president of the Samiti, said that they will conduct Govardhan Puja and Annkoot Puja on a designated namaz site in Sector 12 on November 5. Members of civil society groups said that their constitutional rights were being violated as every citizen has a right to practice their religion freely. “I have come to know via media reports that eight spots of Juma Namaz have been cancelled by the administration. I hope that this information is incorrect as there is no basis on which administration can cancel these namaz sites. The administration must ensure that rights of citizens are protected and it does not succumb to the pressure and threats made by hatemongers in the name of religion,” Altaf Ahmad, a member of Gurgaon Nagrik Ekta Manch, said. Ahmad said that the decision taken by the Muslim Ekta Manch, a group representing Muslims in the city, on Monday to stop Friday prayers in public places is a step taken in its personal capacity, and it was not binding on all members of the community.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/namaz-row-admin-withdraws-permissions-for-8-sites-meeting-with-community-leaders-called-101635875990911.html

03-11-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana byelection: INLD’s Abhay Chautala retains Ellenabad seat||Indian National Lok Dal candidate Abhay Singh Chautala on Tuesday retained the INLD’s lone Ellenabad seat in the Haryana assembly by defeating his BJP rival, Gobind Kanda, by 6,739 votes. Abhay polled 65,992 votes, while Kanda got 59,253 votes and Pawan Beniwal of the Congress emerged third with 20,904 votes.This is Abhay’s fifth victory in the assembly elections and he has remained undefeated from this rural Jat-dominated seat since the 2010 byelection that was necessitated after his father OP Chautala resigned as he had won from Uchana Kalan in Jind also. This is the BJP’s second defeat in a Haryana byelection within a year. Last year, BJP candidate Yogeshwar Dutt was defeated by Indu Raj Narwala of the Congress in the Baroda byelection in Sonepat district. Farmer leaders backed Abhay The Ellenabad byelection was necessitated after Abhay resigned from the state assembly in support of farmers protesting against the three farm laws on January 27. This was the first byelection in Haryana after the farmers’ agitation reached Delhi’s borders. Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait had extended support to Abhay at a rally recently. “With the blessings of farmers, I have secured victory from here. The BJP had adopted all methods to influence them but they went in vain. Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar resign because this election was a referendum on the three farm laws,” Abhay said after he was declared winner. This assembly seat includes 35% Jat voters, a majority of whom are dependent on agriculture. Abhay said he will visit Tikri and Singhu borders to express solidarity with the protesting farmers. “If the farmers will ask me to tender my resignation again, I will do the same. The election commission has failed to take action against the ruling party leaders for violating the model code of conduct,”Chautala added.Congress nominee Pawan Beniwal lost security deposit and it seems to be a blow for party’s state chief Kumari Selja, who had inducted him into the party and fielded him in the fray ignoring senior party leader and former Darba Kalan MLA Bharat Singh Beniwal. In the last 10 days, Bharat had remained away from canvassing and had called Pawan as “weak candidate”. As per experts, internal rift was the main reason that Pawan lost his security deposit.Urban votes went to BJP: Expert A retired political science professor of Government College, Bhiwani, Anant Ram, said the results of the Ellenabad byelection are satisfactory both for the BJP and the INLD. “Before the start of the byelection, no one had expected that the BJP would give such a strong fight to the INLD. The Congress has performed poorly. The rural areas are dominated by Abhay but the urban voters have reposed faith in the BJP. So, it’s a win-win for INLD, BJP and protesting farmers. The Congress campaign revolved around state party chief Kumari Selja as the rival faction, led by former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, did not show interest,” Ram said. Overwhelmed by public support: Kanda 81.38% voter turnout was reported in Ellenabad on Saturday. In the 2019 assembly elections, the constituency recorded a polling percentage of 83.24%. BJP candidate Gobind Kanda thanked his supporters. “I’m overwhelmed with the public support. People have backed the development work initiated by the Manohar Lal Khattar government,” he said. Third bypoll victory, levels family record With this victory, Abhay has levelled the record of his father, Om Prakash Chautala, and his grandfather, the late Ch Devi Lal, who had both won three byelections in their political careers. Abhay had won the Rori byelection in 2000 and the Ellenabad byelection in 2010. Former deputy prime minister Ch Devi Lal had won the Sirsa byelection in 1959, Rori in 1974 and Meham in 1985, while OP Chautala had emerged winner from Ellenabad in 1970, Darba in 1990 and Narwana in the 1993 byelection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-byelection-inld-s-abhay-chautala-leading-in-ellenabad-101635834993507.html

The report did not say how many weapons China has today, but a year ago the Pentagon said the number was in the “low 200s” and was likely to double by the end of this decade.The United States, by comparison, has 3,750 nuclear weapons and has no plans to increase. As recently as 2003 the US total was about 10,000. The Biden administration is undertaking a comprehensive review of its nuclear policy and has not said how that might be influenced by its China concerns.The report does not suggest open conflict with China but it fits an emerging U.S. narrative of a People’s Liberation Army, as China calls its military, intent on challenging the United States in all domains of warfare — air, land, sea, space and cyberspace. Against that backdrop, U.S. defense officials have said they are increasingly wary of China’s intentions with regard to the status of Taiwan.“The PLA’s evolving capabilities and concepts continue to strengthen (China’s) ability to ‘fight and win wars’ against a ‘strong enemy’ — a likely euphemism for the United States,” the report said, adding that it makes China more capable of coercing Taiwan, the self-ruled island that China claims as its territory.Wednesday's report is the latest reminder to Congress, already leery of Beijing’s military ambitions, that the Pentagon’s frequent promises to focus more intently on countering China have moved only incrementally beyond the talking stage. The Biden administration is expected to take a new step by following through on its announcement in September of plans to increase the U.S. military presence in Australia, in addition to a controversial decision to help Australia acquire nuclear-powered submarines.China's military modernisation is proceeding on a wide front, but its nuclear advances are especially notable.The Chinese may already have established what is known as a nuclear triad — the combination of land-, sea-, and air-based missiles that the United States and Russia have had for decades, the report said. To its existing land- and sea-based nuclear forces China is adding an air-launched ballistic missile.The Pentagon report was based on information collected through December 2020 and so does not reflect or even mention General Mark Milley’s expression of concern last month about Chinese hypersonic weapon tests last summer that he said came as a troublesome surprise. Wednesday’s report only referred to the widely known fact that China had fielded the DF-17 medium-range ballistic missile, equipped with a hypersonic glide vehicle designed to evade American missile defenses.In remarks shortly before the report's release Wednesday, Milley told the Aspen Security Forum that the hypersonic missile test and other Chinese advances are evidence of what is at stake for the world.“We are witnessing one of the largest shifts in global and geostrategic power that the world has witnessed,” he said.The Pentagon report said China is pursuing a network of overseas bases that “could interfere with” US military operations and could support Chinese military operations against the United States. President Xi Jinping has said China plans to become a global military power by 2049.The Pentagon's wide-ranging assessment of China's military strategy and force development is the latest in an annual series of reports to Congress and in some respects was more detailed than previous versions. For example, it questioned China's compliance with international biological and chemical weapons agreements, citing studies conducted at military medical institutions that discussed identifying, testing and characterizing groups of “potent toxins” that have civilian as well as military uses.The basis of the Pentagon's prediction that China will vastly increase its nuclear arsenal is not spelled out in Wednesday's report. A senior defense official who briefed reporters in advance of the report's public release, and thus spoke on condition of anonymity, said the forecast reflects several known developments, such as China's addition of a nuclear bomber capability, as well as public statements in Chinese official media that have made reference to China needing 1,000 nuclear weapons.The report also asserted that China has begun construction of at least three new missile fields that “cumulatively contain hundreds” of underground silos from which ICBMs could be launched.The report provided no details on the new missile fields, but private nuclear analysts have reported that satellite imagery shows what appear to be vast new missile silo fields under construction in north-central China. In an update published Tuesday, analysts Matt Korda and Hans Kristensen of the Federation of American Scientists said they have seen continued construction progress and have discovered “unique facilities that appear intended to support missile operations once the silo fields become operational.”One of those facilities, they said, is a complex in the mountains surrounded by what appear to be four tunnels into underground facilities. The tunnels are under construction and there are large amounts of excavated soil dumped nearby. This facility’s function is unknown but “could potentially involve missile and/or warhead storage and management,” the analysts said.Other structures under construction may be technical service facilities and launch control centers, they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-expanding-nuclear-force-faster-than-predicted-pentagon-report-101635957331348.html
03-11-2021||World||Diwali Day Act introduced in US Congress to declare festival as federal holiday||Led by Congresswoman Carolyn B Maloney from New York, lawmakers on Wednesday announced that a bill has been introduced in the House of Representatives to declare Diwali, festival of lights, a federal holiday.“I'm very, very happy and excited to be introducing the Deepavali Day Act this week alongside members of the Congressional Indian Caucus, which will enshrine Diwali into law as a federal holiday,” Maloney said at an event at the US Capitol.The historic legislation is co-sponsored by a number of lawmakers including Indian-American Congresswoman Raja Krishnamoorthi,Krishnamoorthi has also introduced a resolution in the US Congress recognising the religious and historical significance of Diwali.Maloney said that Diwali this year symbolises the nation's continuing journey out of the darkness of COVID-19.“I am very proud to celebrate with you the victory of light over darkness, the triumph of good over evil and the pursuit of knowledge over ignorance as we do every day. It is truly appropriate that Diwali this year symbolises our nation's continuing journey out of the darkness of COVID-19 and the terrible effects that Democrat depended on the people of our nation,” she said.“Celebrations like Diwali speak to the core of what we all desire for our nation to be a beacon of happiness, healing, learning and light and uncertain times. My colleagues, Indian-American community leaders and I believe that there is no better time to enshrine Diwali as a federal holiday than in the wake of this terrible dark pandemic,” Maloney said.Powerful Congressman Gregory Meeks, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, supported the legislation.“This is something that should be shared with all of us In American society. It's a good day, because we're talking about light over darkness. And that's what this is about,” Meeks said.The House Foreign Affairs Committee will be supporting this and advocating and moving forward with this great bill, he said.Krishnamoorthi said: “On this holiday of Diwali, we should say, be the light you wish to see in the world. Be the light in your community that is needed to dispel the darkness. Be the light in this community that brings hope to the hopeless. Let us be the light that helps the last, the least and the last.”“That is what Diwali is about. And that is why Diwali needs to be a federal holiday,” Krishnamoorthi said, adding that Diwali is also about celebrating Indian-Americans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/diwali-day-act-introduced-in-us-congress-to-declare-festival-as-federal-holiday-101635960542868.html
03-11-2021||World||Myanmar court denies bail for US journalist Danny Fenster, adds new charge||A court in Myanmar on Wednesday rejected the bail application of Danny Fenster, an American journalist jailed for the past five months, and added a new charge against him, his lawyer said.Fenster had already been charged with incitement for allegedly spreading false or inflammatory information, an offense punishable by up to three years in prison.He is also charged with violating the Unlawful Associations Act for alleged links to illegal opposition groups, which carries a possible two-to-three year prison term.His lawyer, Than Zaw Aung, said a new charge of violating immigration law was added Wednesday, under a catch-all provision that calls for a prison term of six months to five years for violating visa conditions.The court's actions come during a visit to Myanmar by Bill Richardson, a former US ambassador to the United Nations. He said he is on a mission to discuss humanitarian aid to strife-torn Myanmar with leaders of its military-installed government.Myanmar has been mired in violence and civil unrest since the military seized power in February, ousting the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi.Protesters against the takeover who faced beatings, shootings and arrests have turned increasingly to armed resistance, and insurgents are active in many parts of the country.Richardson's visit raised hopes that he might seek Fenster's release because he is known for his past efforts to gain the freedom of Americans detained in countries with which Washington has poor relations, such as North Korea.The United States is highly critical of army rule in Myanmar and has instituted diplomatic and economic sanctions targeting its military leadership.Fenster, managing editor of the online news magazine Frontier Myanmar, was detained at Yangon International Airport on May 24 as he was about to board a flight to go to the Detroit area in the United States to see his family.It is still unclear why he was arrested, though the charges involve his work at his previous employer, another online news service, which he left in the middle of last year.His lawyer said his application for release on bail on the sedition charge was rejected Wednesday by the judge, who said it is not allowed under the law.Than Zaw Aung also said he cross-examined seven prosecution witnesses on Wednesday for the incitement and unlawful association charges, including police and airport security personnel.He did not provide details of their testimony.The hearings at the court at Yangon's Insein Prison, where Fenster is jailed, are closed to the media and the public. The defense has not yet presented its case.The judge ruled Wednesday that the court will hold sessions every weekday starting this Friday in order to expedite the trial, Than Zaw Aung said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-court-denies-bail-for-us-journalist-danny-fenster-adds-new-charge-101635961024292.html
03-11-2021||World||Setback for Joe Biden as GOP wins Virginia gubernatorial polls||Republican Glenn Youngkin beat Democrat Terry McAuliffe for governor in the Democratic-leaning Virginia state on Wednesday. It’s a major setback for US President Joe Biden as this was the first electoral battle fought by the Democratic party under his leadership.In other elections on Tuesday, Aftab Pureval, an Indian-American became the first Asian-American mayor of Cincinnati; Eric Adams, a former police officer, was elected the second African-American mayor of New York City; and Michelle Wu became the first woman and Asian-American mayor of Boston,Youngkin’s victory in Virginia, although by a slim margin, also presented the Republican party a way forward, on how to deal with former president Donald Trump who remains popular in the party but whose divisive politics and legacy had driven away scores of moderate Republicans. Youngkin won Trump’s endorsement and his base but kept him away from campaign and did not mention him even once in his victory speech, as ex-president desperately sought credit for it in multiple statements.The other key race - for New Jersey governor - remains too close to be called. Incumbent Democratic governor Phil Murphy is locked in a close contest with his Republican challenger Jack Ciattarelli. A loss here will be the second for the Democratic party on Biden’s watch.Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial races have traditionally been seen as the first test for a US president as they take place in the first year of their presidency and usually point the way to the mid-term and presidential elections. Virginia specially, as acknowledged by Vice-President Kamala Harris.“What happens in Virginia will in large part determine what happens in 2022, 2024, and on,” Harris said at an election rally in support of McAuliffe in Virginia last week. She was referring to the mid-term Congressional elections in 2022, when Republicans are hoping to wrest control of the House of Representatives and the Senate, and the presidential election in 2024.“This is a horrible result for Democrats, and for the White House,” noted Sabato’s Crystal Ball, a political blog from the University of Virginia. “If Biden’s approval rating is in the low-to-mid 40s next year, as it is now, everything we know about political trends and history suggests that the Democrats’ tiny majorities in the House and Senate are at major risk of becoming minorities.”President Biden campaigned for both McAuliffe and Murphy, but his own waning popularity - at 42% approval rating - may have not brought them much electoral benefit.From high approval ratings for his handling of the Covid-19 epidemic and vaccination, which were both mishandled by Trump, and economic recovery, Biden has seen his popularity dipping, triggered largely by the botched handling of the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan.His ambitious legislative agenda of a massive investment in infrastructure overhaul and expansion of social benefits and climate change measures have become stuck in an internal party fight between the progressive and moderate wings of the Democratic party, casting serious doubts on its ability and willingness to govern.Glenn Youngkin’s victory in Virginia was part of the Republican’s party’s clean sweep of the top statewide posts up for grabs - the Lt Governor and Attorney General, both won by Republicans, who also flipped the House of Delegates (their Vidhan Sabha).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/setback-for-joe-biden-as-gop-wins-virginia-gubernatorial-polls-101635960360356.html
03-11-2021||World||Indian-Tibetan Aftab Pureval elected Mayor of Cincinnati||Aftab Pureval, an Indian-Tibetan has been elected as Mayor of Cincinnati city in the US state of Ohio, making him the first member of the community to be elected for such a position.Pureval, 38, a son of a refugee Tibetan mother and an Indian father, defeated his rival David Mann to win the Mayoral election.“Words can’t express how honoured and excited I am to be the next Mayor of Cincinnati. Tonight, we made history! Let’s get to work!,” Pureval, who unsuccessfully ran for the US House of Representatives last year, said this after his impressive electoral victory.Aftab Karma Singh Pureval is the first Tibetan-American and the first Asian-American Pacific Islanders (AAPI) mayor in the city's history.Pureval, a Democrat, had formerly served as Hamilton County clerk of courts.“Today, AAPI Victory Fund celebrates Aftab Pureval’s historic win as the first Indian-Tibetan American mayor of a major city, who has a bold vision to move Cincinnati forward,” AAPI Victory Fund founder and chairman Shekar Narasimhan said a day after the historic election of Pureval.In March of this year, AAPI Victory Fund had endorsed Aftab as “a necessary progressive voice that has been able to achieve success with Democrats and Republicans alike” in its slate of mayoral candidates.“This is a triumph for not only Aftab Pureval but also for the AAPI community nationwide. Aftab’s victory is a major step forward for AAPI political representation. It is more important than ever to elect diverse leadership across local, state and federal governments, and Aftab will bring his unique experience to lead Cincinnati toward a more equitable, inclusive, and just city,” said Narasimhan.In a previous interview, Pureval had told PTI that his story is improbably American.“I'm the son of a refugee. My mom was born in Tibet and she was forced to flee her home country along with my grandparents,” he said.“My grandparents, my mother picked up and made their way through the Himalayas through Nepal and into India where she grew up as a refugee,” he said.His mother studied in a Mysore school and went to Delhi for college education, where she met his Punjabi father.“My (paternal) grandfather was in the Indian military (Brg. Ajit Singh),” he said.After marriage, his parents moved to the US and settled in Ohio where he was born in 1982. He has travelled to Tibet once as a child, but has been a frequent visitor to India, especially to Delhi to meet his grandparents, who passed away recently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indiantibetan-aftab-pureval-elected-mayor-of-cincinnati-101635958354221.html

Truman was today re-elected President of the United States of America for four years in one of the most sensational upsets in American history. His 46-year-old Republican opponent, Mr Thomas Dewey, Governor of New York, conceded his surprise victory in this photo finish election at 4-15 p.m., G.M.T., (9-45 p.m., I.S.T.)- after the world had been kept waiting for nearly 12 hours. Sixty-four-year-old Democrat, Mr Truman, the "hopeless chance," also swept his party to power in both Houses of Congress in one of the closest election races in U.S. history. Mr. Dewey said Mr. Truman was sure to win an Electoral College majority. From New York Mr. Dewey sent a congratulatory telegram to Mr Truman at Kansas City. The telegram said: "My heartiest congratulations to you on your election and every good wish for a successful administration and urge an Americans to unite behind you in support of every effort to keep our nation strong and free and establish peace in the world." Voting figures had run neck to neck through some 15 hours of counting before Mr. Dewey finally conceded. When Mr. Dewey conceded, Mr. Truman was leading in 28 States, carrying between them 304 electoral votes. Required to win are 266 electoral votes. Mr. Dewey was leading in 16 States with 189 electoral votes.The last Republican hope that Mr. Dewey might nose out the President in the electoral vote, even though he was trailing well behind in popular voting, apparently faded with the late California returns, which put Mr. Truman ahead in that State. The political prophets were completely confounded by the final out-come of the keen contest, though Mr. Truman himself had complete confidence in the result. Congress results were still not final, but latest returns indicated this line-up. Senate:-54 Democrats and 42 Republicans-required majority 49.House of Representatives: 246 Democrats, 188 Republicans and one American Labour-required majority 218. The Republicans had been in the majority in both Houses of Congress since 1946.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ht-this-day-nov-4-1948-truman-elected-u-s-president-101635956739306.html
03-11-2021||World||US 'black lists' Israeli maker of Pegasus spyware||US authorities on Wednesday put the Israeli maker of the Pegasus spyware on a list of restricted companies, taking aim at software central to a scandal over surveillance of journalists and officials.The company, NSO, was engulfed in controversy over reports that tens of thousands of human rights activists, journalists, politicians and business executives worldwide were listed as potential targets of its Pegasus software.Smartphones infected with Pegasus are essentially turned into pocket spying devices, allowing the user to read the target's messages, look through their photos, track their location and even turn on their camera without them knowing."These tools have also enabled foreign governments to conduct transnational repression, which is the practice of authoritarian governments targeting dissidents, journalists and activists outside of their sovereign borders to silence dissent," the US Commerce Department said in a statement.NSO did not immediately reply to a request for comment.Washington also targeted Israeli company Candiru, Singapore-based Computer Security Initiative Consultancy PTE (COSEINC) and Russian firm Positive Technologies.- 'Zero-click' attack -The companies' addition to the so-called "entity list" means that exports to them from US organizations are restricted. For example, it is now far harder for American researchers to sell them information or technology.An international media investigation reported in July that several governments used the Pegasus malware, created by NSO Group, to spy on activists, journalists and politicians."Today's action is a part of the Biden-Harris Administration's efforts to put human rights at the center of US foreign policy, including by working to stem the proliferation of digital tools used for repression," the Commerce statement said.Following the initial concern over Pegasus, a subsequent wave of worries emerged when iPhone maker Apple released a fix in September for a weakness that can let the spyware infect devices without users even clicking on a malicious message or link.The so-called "zero-click" is able to silently corrupt the targeted device, and was identified by researchers at Citizen Lab, a cybersecurity watchdog organization in Canada.UN experts have called for an international moratorium on the sale of surveillance technology until regulations are implemented to protect human rights following an Israeli spyware scandal.Israel's defense establishment has set up a committee to review NSO's business, including the process through which export licenses are granted.NSO has insisted its software is intended for use only in fighting terrorism and other crimes, and says it exports to 45 countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-black-lists-israeli-maker-of-pegasus-spyware-101635953853390.html

Thirty people suspected of posting “lies” have been referred to the judiciary for investigation, the statement said. The Turkish leader’s health became a hot subject on social media after a short video clip purportedly showing him walking with great difficulty went viral on Friday. Another video in July showed Erdogan dozing off for a few seconds during an address to members of his ruling AK Party, unleashing speculation that the 67-year-old president might be ailing. Aides have posted videos of Erdogan playing basketball and other sports to dispel what they say is pure speculation. On Wednesday, spokesman Fahrettin Altun shared a 13-second video on Twitter showing a masked Erdogan taking 19 steps away from a black limousine outside the presidential palace, followed by a military officer in line with protocol. The video title read: “Trust for friends, fear for enemies.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkey-begins-probe-into-twitter-posts-suggesting-president-erdogan-died-101635943956577.html
03-11-2021||World||Tennis star Peng Shuai’s #MeToo claim against retd vice-premier rocks China||A #MeToo allegation against a retired top Communist Party of China (CPC) official has sparked an online firestorm and swift censorship in China. Peng Shuai, 35, a former Chinese world number one in doubles tennis, has accused former vice-premier Zhang Gaoli, 75, of coercing her into having sex and subsequently continuing an on-and-off secret relationship with her for years.Peng’s allegations against Zhang, made in an emotional post on China’s Twitter-like Weibo on Tuesday night, is the first #MeToo allegation against a top CPC leader.Zhang Gaoli, the vice-premier, was among the seven members of the CPC Politburo Standing Committee, the highest decision-making body in China, between 2013 and 2018, under President Xi Jinping.Peng’s post, published at 10pm on Tuesday, was swiftly deleted but not before netizens had taken screenshots and shared it across social media platforms.Any search related to the topic including Peng’s name and the word “tennis” was banned from Weibo late on Tuesday night.The swift censorship indicated the level of sensitivity that the Chinese government attaches to any discussion on the top leadership’s alleged misdemeanours even if it involves retired leaders.Peng’s accusations made in Mandarin could not be corroborated.Neither Peng nor Zhang have made any public comments following the former’s Weibo post.The Chinese foreign ministry declined to comment when asked for a response on Peng’s allegations and the censorship.“I have never heard and this is not a diplomatic question,” foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said on Wednesday.Peng, who has played with and against Indian tennis star, Sania Mirza, has won the women’s doubles at both Wimbledon and French Open.In her post, that goes back and forth in time, Peng said she had sexual relations with Zhang when he was the top party official of Tianjin, a city some 100km from Beijing, between 2007 and 2012.She said he had first assaulted her after inviting her to play tennis with him and his wife.“I never consented that afternoon, crying all the time,” she wrote, not specifying when exactly the assault occurred, according to a translation of the post by the New York Times.Peng wrote that after that he was promoted to the Standing Committee in 2013 and during his tenure as a member of the party leadership, Zhang did not contact her.But after he retired in 2018, he contacted her and their relations resumed though his wife knew about it.Peng was invited by Zhang to his home at a time when his wife was present and was forced into a sexual relationship, the post says. Subsequently, they could often meet in secret and spend time with each other.The post suggests Zhang tried to end the relationship with Peng on Tuesday while saying he was afraid of leaving evidence such as recordings.“I feel like a walking corpse, pretending, pretending every day, which I am the real me? I shouldn’t have come to this world, but I don’t have the courage to die. I really want to live simply, but it backfired,” she wrote.“I know that for someone of your eminence, vice-premier Zhang Gaoli, you’ve said that you’re not afraid,” Peng wrote in her post as per the NYT translation, “but even if it’s just me, like an egg hitting a rock, or a moth to the flame, courting self-destruction, I’ll tell the truth about you.”Lu Pin, the founder of the now-banned Chinese online forum Feminist Voices, wrote on her Twitter handle why Peng’s post was important.“Peng Shuai’s revelation is very important. It allows people to see the real-life of China’s top leaders as never before. Behind the power-wrapped morality, their excessive abuse of power, corruption…” Lu wrote.“First of all, she has a lot of shame and self-blame, and she even talks about ‘love’. After all, everyone is poisoned by patriarchy. But the important thing is that, like other victims, she knows from the bottom that all that is unjust and that she is being bullied, even if there is no ready-made term to define what happened to her,” Lu added.“China’s quickly-stifled #MeToo movement has ensnared academics, journalists, NGO workers…but never had a high-level party official been accused. The burden of proof and the political pressure brought to bear will be huge. And Peng herself admits to having no evidence,” SupChina, a New York-based China-focused website reported.“So quickly are social media posts being censored on Chinese sites about this that people are resorting to using #tennis and #melon (meaning drama) in Chinese to talk about this…both terms are trending on Weibo now,” the SupChina report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tennis-star-peng-shuai-s-metoo-claim-against-retd-vice-premier-rocks-china-101635938998098.html
03-11-2021||World||At COP26, India & UK launch Green Grids Initiative to offer clean power to world||Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his United Kingdom's counterpart Boris Johnson jointly launched a new flagship international initiative late on Tuesday night at the COP26 World Leaders' Summit in Glasgow, backed by over 80 countries, to dramatically accelerate the global transition to clean powered world.Jointly led by India and the United Kingdom, the new initiative, called ‘Green Grids Initiative – One Sun One World One Grid’ (GGI-OSOWOG), is aimed at accelerating the development and deployment of interconnected electricity grids across continents, countries and communities, and improve energy access of the poorest through mini-grids and off-grid solutions.It features as one of the leading initiatives under the Glasgow Breakthroughs also launched at the clean innovation and technology event, part of a new joint plan that will see countries and businesses coordinate and strengthen their climate actions every year in polluting sectors to dramatically scale and speed up the deployment of clean technologies and drive down costs globally.Apart from India and the UK, Australia, France and the United States are also part of the steering committee of the 'Green Grids Initiative'.Modelled on the UK’s recent net-zero strategy, the Glasgow Breakthroughs will see countries and businesses coordinate and strengthen their climate actions every year in each sector to dramatically scale and speed up the deployment of clean technologies and drive down costs. The aim is for clean technologies to become the default choice this decade globally in each polluting sector and to catalyse the growth of a new economy built around new green industries and jobs globally.In launching the GGI-OSOWOG, the two Prime Ministers unveiled the ‘One Sun Declaration’ setting out a shared vision of harnessing the full potential of clean power globally through the much greater interconnection of electricity grids across continents, countries and communities, including mini-grids and off-grid solutions to ensure no one is left without access to energy.To meet the goals of the Paris Agreement and limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the world will need to transition to clean power, increasing the global reliance on renewable energy, like solar and wind power. Transitioning to this clean powered future will require developing an electricity infrastructure that is capable of coping with far greater shares of variable renewable energy, while meeting growing power demands securely, reliably and affordably.Speaking after the launch, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the ‘One Sun One World One Grid’ and ‘Green Grids Initiative’ is “an idea whose time has come." “If the world has to move to a clean and green future, these interconnected transnational grids are going to be critical solutions. I congratulate the International Solar Alliance and the UK COP Presidency for bringing it nearer to implementation,” Modi said.The GGI-OSOWOG will help make this happen, by bringing together a global coalition of energy grid stakeholders, including governments and businesses, to accelerate the expansion of energy grids across regions and continents and create the foundations for universal access to sustainable energy. This will ensure the infrastructure is in place for the whole world to be powered by renewable energy, as part of the global push to realise the clean energy transition. Echoing his Indian counterpart, UK's Prime Minister Boris Johnson said his country is working hand in hand with “friends in India to transform the future of the power sector” and ensure clean and reliable electricity is accessible everywhere by the end of this decade.“It’s fantastic that over 80 countries have backed our newly launched Green Grids Initiative, whose collaboration will not only see greater growth, jobs and investment in our global green future but also make sure no one is left without access to energy," Johnson said.Keeping 1.5 degrees Celsius alive means global emissions will need to be cut in half by 2030. Achieving this will require a dramatic acceleration in innovation and deployment of clean energy solutions, and on a global scale. The International Energy Agency’s recent analysis calls for a tripling in investment in grid expansion and modernisation from $260 billion to $800 billion annually by 2030.The initiative will help to mobilise financial and technical resources to advance grid developments, and also promote the sharing of existing expertise and best practice across the globe. This international collaboration will be key to making the clean energy transition faster, cheaper and easier for all.The new GGI-OSOWOG initiative combines the UK Green Grids Initiative with India’s One Sun One World One Grid programme. This joint programme will create a global coalition of leading actors in the green grids field, to accelerate the expansion of energy grids across regions and continents.As a leading new international initiative, the global GGI-OSOWOG will support the newly launched ‘Breakthrough Agenda’, and specifically the ‘Glasgow Power Breakthrough’, which aims to make ‘clean power the most affordable and reliable option for all countries to meet their power needs efficiently by 2030’.This initiative represents the strong historic bilateral relationship between the UK and India.

The company said that those employees have been put on unpaid leave."Our employees have done their part, with now over 96 per cent fully vaccinated. The employees who are not vaccinated or do not have a medical or other permitted exemption have been put on unpaid leave," ANI quoted the company's deputy chief executive officer, Michael Russo, as saying.This came after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, in October, ordered air, rail and shipping companies to establish vaccination policies for their workers.The vaccination requirement was also made compulsory for airlines as well as concession and hospitality workers.Canada has registered a total of 1,720,355 cases of Coronavirus (Covid-19) disease and 29,056 deaths for the entire period of the pandemic. The daily number of Covid-19 cases is currently decreasing, with 2,283 new cases registered per day. Canada has administered at least 58,756,154 doses of Covid-19 vaccines, which means about 78 per cent of the country's population has been vaccinated.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/air-canada-puts-over-800-unvaccinated-employees-on-unpaid-leave-report-101635926085364.html

It is a major step forward for our nation in our fight to defeat the virus.”The CDC said the vaccination of children could begin “as soon as possible”. Distribution of the paediatric vaccine has already begun and plans afoot to scale up to full capacity starting on November 8, CDC said, adding that vaccines will be available at multiple locations, including paediatric health care provider offices, pharmacies, Federally Qualified Health Centers (HRSA).“Together, with science leading the charge, we have taken another important step forward in our nation’s fight against the virus that causes Covid-19,” said CDC head Rochelle Walensky. “As a mom, I encourage parents with questions to talk to their paediatrician, school nurse or local pharmacist to learn more about the vaccine and the importance of getting their children vaccinated.”Pfizer’s paediatric vaccine was nearly 91% effective in preventing Covid-19 among children aged 5-11 years in clinical trials, same as for the vaccine fro adults and adolescents. Vaccine side effects were mild, self-limiting, and similar to those seen in adults and with other vaccines recommended for children, CDC said. The most common side effect was a sore arm. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had cleared the paediatric vaccine earlier. It’s the same Pfizer vaccine but the dosage is a third of what is administered to adults and teens. It will be administered in same regimen: two shots three weeks apart, but using a smaller needle.Covid-19 cases among children are known to result in hospitalizations, deaths, MIS-C (inflammatory syndromes) and long-term complications, such as “long Covid,” in which symptoms can linger for months, the CDC has said. The spread of the more transmissible Delta variant during past summer led to a surge in in Covid-19 cases in children. The CDC said that during a six-week period in late June to mid-August, Covid-19 cases among children spiked five fold.With the CDC clearance, the US becomes one of the few countries to be inoculating children. Among countries using other Covid-19 vaccines in children under 12 is China, which just began vaccinations for 3-year-olds, according to Associated Press news agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/major-step-forward-us-gives-final-approval-of-pfizer-s-covid-vaccine-for-children-aged-511-101635925076698.html

Taking to Twitter, Trump Jr. said that the Democrats had collapsed under President Biden.Also Read | US Election Day 2021: All you need to know“When Biden wakes up tomorrow afternoon, somebody's gonna have to tell him he is officially presiding over the collapse of the Democrat Party,” the 43-year-old businessman tweeted, as exit polls projected victory for Glenn Youngkin in Virginia and Jack Ciattarelli in New Jersey over Terry McAuliffe and Phil Murphy, respectively. When Biden wakes up tomorrow afternoon, somebody’s gonna have to tell him he’s now officially presiding over the collapse of the Democrat partyWhile Youngkin is projected to comfortably defeat former Virginia governor McAuliffe, the race between Ciattarelli and incumbent Phil Murphy in New Jersey is expected to be close, with a slight edge to the former.Trump Jr., meanwhile, also shared a statement from his father in which the former President congratulated Youngkin. “I would like to thank by BASE for coming out in force and voting for Glenn Youngkin. Without you, he would not have been close to winning. The Make America Great Again (MAGA) move is bigger and stronger than ever before. Glenn will be a great governor,” the statement read. Congrats to @GlennYoungkin!!! https://t.co/VfX2GIsOr5The New Jersey and Virginia gubernatorial elections, which, along with several other polls, constituted November 2's ‘Election Day,’ were held in the backdrop of the United States' chaotic military exit from Afghanistan, with American forces leaving the war-torn nation on August 30, nearly 20 years after arriving on the Afghan soil in 2001. Biden faced severe flak for the execution of the pullout, though he said there was "never a good time to withdraw US forces."The American exit from Afghanistan paved the way for the Taliban to seize power in that country for a second time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/when-biden-wakes-up-tomorrow-trump-jr-mocks-us-president-over-election-day-results-101635916818476.html
03-11-2021||World||In blow for Biden, Republican wins tight election in Virginia||The Republican candidate pulled off a stunning upset to win the governor's mansion in the US state of Virginia Wednesday, US television networks projected, in a race seen as an early verdict on President Joe Biden's first year in office.Newcomer Glenn Youngkin was 2.7 points ahead of Democrat Terry McAuliffe in the neck-and-neck tussle shortly after midnight, with more than 95 percent of the vote counted, prompting NBC, CNN and ABC to call the election for the Republican.A harbinger of the parties' prospects in next year's midterm elections, the race was initially expected to be a comfortable Democratic win but instead became a toss-up in the closing days of the campaign.A private equity multi-millionaire who has never run for office defeating a former popular Democratic governor will be seen as a disaster for Biden going into the all-important 2022 races that will determine who controls Congress."All right Virginia -- we won this thing! How much fun!" Youngkin, who poured at least $20 million of his own fortune into the race, told cheering fans after dancing onstage to Norman Greenbaum's 1969 hit "Spirit in the Sky."Calling his victory a "defining moment," he told the crowd: "Together, we will change the trajectory of this commonwealth. And friends, we are going to start that transformation on day one."The election, a neck-and-neck tussle for weeks, resonated nationwide as a proxy war between Biden and former president Donald Trump, who gave Youngkin his early backing.Youngkin's campaign will now likely become a blueprint for Republicans across the country as they strategize on how to leverage Trump's base while avoiding becoming tainted by his toxic brand among moderates in the midterms.Difficult yearThe Democratic faithful had badly wanted the race to be a referendum on Trump but in reality he had little to do with the campaign and was never likely to prove the galvanizing nemesis they had hoped for.Early in the campaign, Youngkin accepted Trump's endorsement and steered clear of criticizing the twice-impeached former president.But he also pointedly avoided standing next to the Republican leader, who is seen as beyond the pale among independents in much of Virginia, or presenting himself as a Trump acolyte.McAuliffe's loss will also almost certainly spook moderates on Capitol Hill and drive some away from supporting Biden's stalled $3 trillion vision for remaking the economy.The long delays on passing promised social welfare and infrastructure packages are an echo of 2009-10, when the Democrats suffered big losses amid gridlock in Washington.Elections were also being held in multiple other states, with voters overwhelmingly backing Democrat Eric Adams for mayor of New York and Democratic New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy just behind in a surprisingly close reelection battle he was nevertheless expected to win.But Virginia is where the battle lines had been most visibly drawn.Culture warMcAuliffe faced significant headwinds as he tried to mount a return to an office he held four years ago, with the majority party in Washington usually incurring losses during a president's first term.Youngkin had to perform his own high-wire act, as the vast majority of Republicans believe Trump's false claims that the presidency was stolen in a fraudulent election, making acknowledging the truth politically risky.He turned the conversation instead to local "culture war" issues like abortion, mask mandates and the teaching of America's racial history.McAuliffe took an early lead in the race but his seven-point cushion evaporated in the final days, with a polling average by political analysis website FiveThirtyEight showing Youngkin ahead by one point on election day.Leaning into his image as the establishment candidate, the 64-year-old McAuliffe sold himself as a former incumbent who brought back jobs after the worldwide financial crisis of 2008, and pledged to repeat the trick for the pandemic.But nine months after Democrats added the US Senate to their victory in the White House, Virginians sought a fresh start, handing Youngkin 51 percent of the vote and the Republican Party its first statewide office in the so-called Old Dominion in over a decade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-blow-for-biden-republican-wins-tight-election-in-bellwether-virginia-101635918030840.html

The group has been protesting against the Pakistan government for months, demanding the release of its party chief Saad Rizvi who was arrested in April this year.TLP is the same group that spearheaded the major anti-France protests after President Emmanuel Macron defended the right of a satirical magazine to republish cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed.“Some 860 TLP workers were freed on Tuesday. They were detained under section 3 of MPO (maintenance of public order). No case was registered against them,” the Punjab Home Department said in a statement, according to news agency PTI. Other detainees from the protest who have first information reports (FIRs) registered against them would have to obtain bail from courts, the report further said.Last week, thousands of TLP supporters began a march from the eastern city of Lahore to capital Islamabad. The protesters reached about one-third of the way before they called it off. However, the protests are still continuing with protesters staging a sit-in at parks in the city of Wazirabad. The demonstrators say that they will not withdraw their agitation until the Pakistan government fulfills 50 per cent of the terms of their agreement."In case any further arrests of the party’s workers or leaders are made, the agreement with the government will stand cancelled," said Tehreek-e-Labbaik's Mufti Muneeb Rehman, warning the Pakistan government, PTI reported. “If the government appears non-serious with regard to the agreement, it will have to face a more forceful protest movement,” Muneeb also said.Details regarding the deal between the group and the Pakistan government are not known yet.

The next one was about the Quetta attack on lawyers in which we also lost journalists. Here, the PFF did most of the work, which was also not easy as it required sensitivity," Dawn quoted Haque as saying."I don't usually do the writing and edits for our website but for this particular site, I personally sat down to do all that. The data, the stories of each fallen journalist is horrifying, it affects you," he said.According to senior journalist Ghazala Fasih, the figures shared by PPF show that 76 journalists have been murdered since 2002, Dawn reported.A report of the Freedom Network launched on the eve of the International Day to End Impunity for Crimes against Journalists, said that nearly two dozen journalists in Pakistan were charged in the last two years and most of them were prosecuted under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA), as per The News International.Despite being a democratic state, Pakistan continues to suppress free speech in digital spaces, stopping its citizens from participating in the working of the state by depriving them of a resourceful channel for vocalising their concerns.Report 2020 by Media Matters for Democracy (MMfD) says that the country performed poorly in all the indicators that determine free speech and that the Covid-19 pandemic further exacerbated the digital censorship in Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/website-launched-in-pakistan-to-highlight-govt-s-crackdown-against-media-101635913094086.html

The highly-infectious delta variant is hurtling across the country in latest round of spike despite the increasingly aggressive measures that local officials have enacted in a bid to thwart it.On Wednesday, China recorded 93 fresh cases of Covid-19, setting another daily record. Local infections have been found in 19 of 31 provinces. Eleven asymptomatic infections were also reported, according to National Health Commission, which are not added to the official tally.This is up from 54 a day earlier and the highest daily count since August 9 at the peak of China's last major outbreak. Beijing reported nine new local infections, the most since January 19.Three more provinces detected cases - central Chongqing, Henan and Jiangsu on the eastern coast.The fresh outbreak has so far been concentrated mostly in northern China. With the latest daily caseload, China has recorded 631 cases of Covid-19 between October 17 and November 2.Meanwhile, officials in China said they are committed to maintaining the zero-tolerance Covid policy despite the flare-ups that are coming faster, spreading further and evading many of the measures that previously controlled it.Temperature screening has been set up at entrances of shopping malls, supermarkets, hotels, cinemas and subway stations in Beijing, while a legion of personnel on the ground check the health codes of visiting individuals on their mobile phones.More than 33,000 visitors inside Shanghai's Disneyland were allowed to leave on Sunday only after their Covid test results came negative as one confirmed patient had visited the resort on Saturday.As of November 2, mainland China had 97,423 confirmed cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/93-cases-in-24-hours-how-covid-19-is-rearing-its-head-again-in-china-101635912858501.html

Siblings JJ Altobelli and Alexis Altobelli, whose mother, father and sister were killed, will share another $1.25 million.Bryant's widow Vanessa has also sued Los Angeles County, alleging that she and her family suffered emotional distress over the pictures. That lawsuit continues.An investigation into the crash found the pilot had probably become disorientated after flying the Sikorsky S-76 into clouds.Bryant is widely recognized as one of the greatest basketball players ever, a figure who became the face of his sport during a glittering two decades with the Lakers.He was a five-time NBA champion in a career that began in 1996 straight out of high school and lasted until his retirement in 2016.He was also a two-time Olympic gold medalist, helping spark the US squad of NBA stars to titles in 2008 in Beijing and 2012 in London.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kobe-bryant-chopper-crash-victim-families-win-2-5-million-over-photos-101635912019852.html
03-11-2021||World||'Unprecedented nuclear buildup': Concerns as China missile silos show progress||China has made significant progress at three sites, suspected to be missile silo fields, which have western experts concerned. The three sites are located near Yumen, Hami and Ordos in north-central China.Their progress is being monitored by Federation of American Scientists (FAS), a US-based non-partisan policy think tank. They have studied the progress at the three missile sites through commercial satellite images provided by Planet Labs and Maxar Technologies.These images offer the most detailed pictures yet of the three sites, where FAS believes China is constructing 300 new missile silos.The FAS researchers believe that the pace of construction gives them confidence that they are related to Chinese military's modernisation programme. The progress has been reported almost on a weekly basis, said FAS."For China, this is an unprecedented nuclear buildup," Matt Korda and Hans M Kristensen, the authors of FAS report said on Tuesday, adding that is raises questions and uncertainty about China's minimum nuclear deterrent and policies.The authors, however, added, "The apparent missile silo fields are still many years away from becoming fully operational and it remains to be seen how China will arm and operate them."Both Korda and Kristensen fear the rapid pace at which the silos are being constructed could increase nuclear competition and fuel worst-case planning in other nuclear weapon states.The first silo field was discovered in June this year. Another report a second field was discovered in July, prompting the US Strategic Command to tweet about "the growing threat the world faces and the veil of secrecy that surrounds it".FAS had then said that these sites signify "the most significant expansion of the Chinese nuclear arsenal ever". It added that this is the most extensive silo construction since the US and Soviet missile silo construction during the Cold War.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unprecedented-nuclear-buildup-concerns-as-china-missile-silos-show-progress-101635911023445.html
03-11-2021||World||Eric Adams wins in NYC, capping ascent from cop to mayor-elect||Eric Leroy Adams was elected the 110th mayor of New York City Tuesday, following a campaign in which he won the support of New Yorkers across class and racial lines with promises to restore the pandemic-ravaged city to its former glory.The Associated Press declared the 61-year-old Democratic Brooklyn borough president the winner over Republican anti-crime activist Curtis Sliwa. Adams had 67% of the vote with 65% of precincts reporting, according to the AP, which called the race 11 minutes after polls closed.“I’m perfectly imperfect, and the city is made up of perfectly imperfect people,” Adams said at an Election Night party at the Marriott hotel in Downtown Brooklyn. “That’s the combination that will allow us to create a perfect city where no one is left behind.”Flanked by family and supporters, Adams used his victory speech to highlight the resolve of blue-collar New Yorkers who helped propel him to City Hall. He also called for unity in a “divided” city, pledging to bring firefighters, police officers and other civil servants into the fold.The mayor-elect also targeted business leaders as partners in the city’s future growth, seeking to deviate from Mayor Bill de Blasio’s anti-business rhetoric. “We have to get this out of our head that the CEOs in this city don’t want to participate in uplifting our city,” he said. “It’s time to build bridges we’ve destroyed in the past. We need each other.” In another contrast with de Blasio, who clashed with former Governor Andrew Cuomo, Adams also used the moment to showcase his determination to work alongside Governor Kathy Hochul. Taking center stage in the middle of Adams’s Tuesday night speech, Hochul called her relationship with Adams the beginning of a “new era of cooperation.”Following the speech, Adams’s campaign said he was headed to an after-party at the members-only club Zero Bond in Manhattan, where billionaire Mike Novogratz and Wendi Deng were already in attendance. Adams’s election to what’s known as the “second-toughest job in America” catapults him to a national political figure at the center of some of the nation’s most intractable debates. He’s a reform-minded but tough-on-crime former police officer at a time of rising worries about crime and frayed police-community relations. He’s a moderate Democrat in an increasingly progressive party. And he’s proclaimed an end to “anti-business” rhetoric while demanding the city’s businesses better address income inequality and other social ills.Tuesday’s victory over Sliwa, founder of the Guardian Angels anti-crime patrol, was preordained in a city where Democrats outnumber Republicans by roughly 7-to-1. Sliwa tried to capture the city’s attention with TikTok videos and publicity stunts centered around a platform of public safety, tax reform and animal rights. Adams dismissed his challenger’s campaign as “buffoonery.”In a new era for city government, Democrat Alvin Bragg was elected Manhattan’s first Black district attorney and Democrat Brad Lander was elected city comptroller.De Facto Mayor-ElectAdams has conducted himself as the de facto mayor-elect since July, when a lengthy ballot-counting process ended with Adams atop a 13-candidate Democratic field. Primary election results showed that Adams won on the strength of Black, Hispanic and low-income voters in the city’s outer boroughs. After his victory, he was quick to proclaim himself the “face of the new Democratic party” and weigh in on vaccine mandates, school programs and other decisions made by outgoing Mayor Bill de Blasio.When Adams is sworn in Jan. 1, he will replace the term-limited de Blasio, whose eight-year mayoralty was defined by the coronavirus crisis, clashes over policing and an ill-fated run for president.“The policies I ran on, they were clear,” he said outside a polling site in Brooklyn Tuesday. “It’s about being safe. It’s about working on behalf of blue-collar people.”Incoming New York mayors have faced challenges before. Ed Koch inherited a crime-ridden city on the verge of bankruptcy in 1978. Former Mayor Michael Bloomberg was nominated in a primary election scheduled on Sept. 11, 2001 and had to rebuild a city devastated by the terrorist attacks. Bloomberg, founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP, has endorsed Adams.Adams will inherit his own set of problems plaguing New York: Race relations, violent crime, budget headaches, an exodus of work-from-home professionals and a series of union contracts up for negotiation. And Adams’s penchant for trying to be all things to all people -- coupled with vague or even conflicting solutions to some of those problems -- has left business leaders wondering how Adams will act once he shifts from campaigning to governing.Blue-Collar MayorThe second Black mayor in the city’s history, Adams calls himself New York City’s first blue-collar mayor. He was born in Brooklyn in 1960, and his family moved to Queens when he was 8. Adams often recounts how he joined a gang at 14, and was arrested and beat by police at 15. And at 24 -- inspired both to serve and reform the New York Police Department -- he joined the force.Over 22 years of law enforcement experience, Adams led groups of Black officers and rose to the rank of captain -- giving him a unique and often complicated perspective on policing. He was criticized during the Democratic primary for supporting stop-and-frisk policies, albeit a modified version.He first started plotting a run for mayor as early as the 1990s, and briefly registered with the Republican party before running for the New York Senate as a Democrat in 2006. He served four terms in the Senate and two as Brooklyn borough president, where he was all but unopposed.Borough presidents have limited powers, but Adams often used the position to fast-track residential development in Brooklyn while also railing against gentrification. In an interview with Bloomberg News, Adams said he would reverse the “uninviting spirit” that businesses found in the city over the last eight years -- but that begins with an emphasis on safety.“The prerequisite to prosperity is public safety and justice. If the city is not safe, if we don’t bring down gun violence, gang violence, if we don’t bring down those crimes, then our tourism will be impacted,” he said. “Businesses would be impacted. We can’t get employees back into the office spaces because people are afraid to ride the subways.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eric-adams-wins-in-nyc-capping-ascent-from-cop-to-mayorelect-101635911023196.html

His dining-account purchasing power less so, at least until a recent study released by the National Bureau of Economic Research.“He dined often and very well,” as revealed in the series of novels and short stories launched by Ian Fleming and continued by a number of successors, economists Lee A. Craig, Julianne Treme and Thomas J. Weiss wrote in an NBER working paper.The economists constructed data sets for both Bond’s estimated salary and the cost of meals at French restaurants that he went to. Analysis shows that the British secret agent’s purchasing power depreciated over time -- especially since the 1999 introduction of the euro, which has climbed versus the pound.“As measured by a luxury basket of goods that included a weekly dinner and wine for two at a French restaurant, Bond, early on in his career, i.e. during the Fleming era of the 1950s and 1960s, would have spent 18% (using current exchange rates) of his salary,” the economists said.During the euro era, that share would have climbed to 26% on average. By about 2019, Bond “would have needed a third of his salary to dine well regularly in France,” they wrote.To compile the estimates, the economists scoured the Bond books for names of restaurants -- 23 of which were in France, and all but two of those were included in the Michelin Guide. They then used Michelin Guide prices to cost out Bond’s meals.The sample includes a variety of restaurant types, ranging from two of the most highly rated restaurants in France -- Oustau de Baumaniere, located in Les Baux de Provence, and Grand Vefourn in Paris, both of which had 3 stars -- to bistros like Le Galion in Menton, Chez Andre and Terminus Nord in Paris, and La Rotonde de Montparnasse as well as La Rotonde in Nice.The authors said it was possible to chart the price of a typical meal for a sample of some 18 of the French restaurants going back to 1953.As for Bond’s salary, Fleming revealed in “Moonraker” in 1955 that he earned 1,500 pounds a year, nearly 3.5 times the average annual earnings in the U.K. at the time. A subsequent salary was estimated “based on that of someone in the same Civil Service grade as Bond,” which would have risen 6.3% annually on average through 2019 -- roughly keeping pace with meal prices, the working paper showed.A second series was estimated under the scenario that Bond might have earned a “risk premium,” or extra increases for his years in service.“Even at that higher salary, he would still have had to spend 21% of his income at current exchange rates on dinner for two in the 2002-19 period,” the authors wrote.” “While that may seem a little too steep for many of us, perhaps not for a bon vivant like Bond, who, after all, was not saving for his children’s orthodontia or education.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/james-bond-s-salary-hasn-t-kept-up-with-french-restaurant-costs-shows-study-101635902520943.html

A lot has been achieved in the fight against the disease, with many countries launching their own vaccines to counter the infection.However, the number of cases around the globe has crossed 240 million and the disease has claimed more than five million lives. But, the pace of the spread has slowed down in recent weeks.India, for example, recorded 10,423 new cases on Tuesday, the lowest in 259 days. The active cases too declined to 1,53,776, the lowest in 250 days. The daily rise in new coronavirus infections in India has been below 20,000 for 25 straight days and less than 50,000 daily new cases have been reported for 128 consecutive days now.And there are some countries which have been able to control the infection more effectively. The World Health Organization (WHO) hosts a list of all the countries and keeps updating it based on the number of Covid-19 cases recorded in last 24 hours.Some of these countries recorded zero Covid-19 cases in the last 24 hours, according to WHO dashboard. They are:• Canada• Argentina• Spain• Bangladesh• Belgium• Costa Rica• Sri Lanka• Ecuador• Myanmar• Honduras• Ghana• El Salvador• Cameroon• Maldives• LuxembourgThere are many other countries which have been able to stave off the pandemic, since these are islands in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. Some strict travel policies are also responsible for negligible spread of the infection in some geographies.For example, Switzerland recorded just three new cases of Covid-19 in the last 24 hours, according to WHO data. Similarly, Oman recorded eight new cases and Zambia five. Others to record 10 or less new Covid cases are Mozambique, Kosovo, Senegal, Malawi, Eswatini, Burundi and Madagascar.However, for countries which report zero or very less number of Covid-19 cases, health experts have in the past expressed concerns that some cases may fly under the radar. Accurate and updated data can be difficult to obtain from countries like North Korea and Turkmenistan, which drew international skpeticism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-spread-countries-which-reported-zero-cases-in-last-24-hours-101635902583163.html
03-11-2021||World||Islamic State claims responsibility as 19 die in Kabul hospital attack||At least 19 people were killed and 50 more wounded in an attack on a military hospital in Kabul on Tuesday, the latest atrocity to rock Afghanistan since the Taliban seized power.The Taliban's rivals, the Islamic State group, claimed responsibility for the gun and bomb assault in the centre of the capital.Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K) said in a statement on its Telegram channels that "five Islamic State group fighters carried out simultaneous coordinated attacks" on the sprawling site."The IS insurgents wanted to target civilians, doctors and patients in the hospital," Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said, claiming that Taliban forces had repulsed the attack within 15 minutes.As part of the response, he said, Taliban "special forces" were dropped onto the roof of the hospital from one of the helicopters that the group seized from Afghanistan's former US-backed government.The attack got under way when a suicide bomber detonated his explosives near the facility's entrance. Gunmen then broke into the hospital grounds, firing their weapons."Nineteen dead bodies and about 50 wounded people have been taken to hospitals in Kabul," a health ministry official who asked not to be named told AFP.Mujahid played down the death toll, but confirmed that two Taliban fighters, two women and a child had been killed outside the hospital.One woman who had been trapped in the hospital when the attack began told AFP how she and her friend "felt we were going to die, that our lives were ending"."There was a blast at the door," Rowana Dawari, a poet and lecturer, told AFP."Daesh came and started firing, we were stuck. We heard firing, glass breaking. We locked ourselves in a bathroom," she said, referring to IS by its local name."Later, Taliban came and we saw they were with our doctors, so we knew it was OK."Amanudhin, a 28-year-old cleaner at the hospital, pushed an elderly, frail and partially sighted patient, Mariam, away from the scene in a wheelchair."The explosion happened and after a while people started screaming 'Daesh is here'," he told AFP. "We heard a lot of firing."We were in the 7th floor and locked ourselves in a room. There were injured people everywhere. Broken glass."They hid until Taliban fighters came to rescue them: "They were special forces, professionals, they broke the door and got inside."Going 'room to room' The Taliban spent 20 years waging an insurgency against the ousted US-backed government.Now they face the struggle of bringing stability to Afghanistan, which has been hit in recent weeks by a series of bloody assaults claimed by the Islamic State group's local chapter."All the attackers are dead. The attack was initiated by a suicide bomber on a motorcycle who blew himself up at the entrance of the hospital," a Taliban official from the government media team said.Two explosions targeted the hospital area, he had earlier said in a statement.AFP staff in the city heard a second explosion some 30 minutes after the first was reported."I heard a big explosion coming from the first checkpoint. We were told to go to safe rooms. I also hear guns firing," a doctor at the Sardar Mohammad Daud Khan hospital told AFP while the attack was being carried out."I can still hear gun firing inside the hospital building. I think the attackers are going from room to room... like the first time it was attacked," the doctor added.Ambulances speeding through KabulThe hospital, which treats wounded soldiers from both the Taliban and former Afghan security forces, was previously attacked in 2017, when gunmen disguised as medical personnel killed at least 30 people in an hours-long siege.Although both IS and the Taliban are hardline Sunni Islamist militants, they differ on details of religion and strategy.IS have claimed four mass casualty attacks since the Taliban takeover on August 15, including suicide bomb blasts targeting Shiite Muslim mosques. The group regards Shiite Muslims as heretics.The 2017 attack was also claimed by the Islamic State group, and the Taliban denied responsibility.Pictures shared on social media on Tuesday showed black smoke billowing into the air after the explosions, the first of which went off at around 1:00 pm (0830 GMT).Roads close to the heavily fortified "Green Zone" where the buildings of several former Western embassies were located were closed off to traffic and Taliban guards scaled up searches.The US State Department condemned the attack, spokesman Ned Price said in a tweet Tuesday evening."We mourn those killed and offer our condolences to their loved ones," he said. "Targeting medical professionals and patients is abhorrent and has no justification."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/islamic-state-claims-responsibility-as-19-die-in-kabul-hospital-attack-101635902260741.html

03-11-2021||World||WHO urges vaccine against bacteria killing 150,000 babies each year||The World Health Organization on Wednesday called for the urgent development of a vaccine against a bacterial infection responsible for nearly 150,000 stillbirths and infant deaths each year.A fresh report by the UN health agency and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine found that the impact of Group B Streptococcus infection (GBS), which is estimated to live harmlessly in the intestinal tracts of up to a third of all adults, is a far bigger cause of preterm births and disability than previously thought.The report confirmed a previous devastating finding from 2017 that the bacterium causes almost 100,000 newborn deaths and close to 50,000 stillbirths each year, although it pointed to significant data gaps suggesting the true figures could be higher.And for the first time it quantified the impact on preterm births, finding that GBS is behind more than half a million early deliveries each year, leading to significant long-term disability.In light of such staggering numbers, the report authors lamented that more progress had not been made towards developing a vaccine."This new research shows that Group B strep is a major and underappreciated threat to newborn survival and wellbeing, bringing devastating impacts for so many families globally," Phillipp Lambach of WHO's immunisation department said in a statement."WHO joins partners in calling for urgent development of a maternal GBS vaccine, which would have profound benefits in countries worldwide."Professor Joy Lawn, who heads LSHTM's maternal adolescent, reproductive and child health centre, agreed."Maternal vaccination could save the lives of hundreds of thousands of babies in the years to come," she said, decrying the lack of progress since the idea of developing a jab against GBS was first raised three decades ago.On average, 15 percent of pregnant women worldwide, or nearly 20 million annually, carry the GBS bacterium in their vagina.But even though most of these cases show no symptoms, an infected pregnant woman can pass GBS to her foetus via the amniotic fluid, or during birth as the infant passes through the vaginal canal.Babies and foetuses are particularly vulnerable because their immune systems are not strong enough to fight the multiplying bacteria.If untreated, GBS can lead to meningitis and septicaemia, which can be deadly. Babies that survive may develop cerebral palsy, or permanent sight and hearing problems.Wednesday's report showed that the bacterium leaves some 40,000 infants each year with neurological impairments.Currently, women with GBS are given antibiotics during labour to reduce the chance of it passing to their baby.But this approach poses problems in places where screening and antibiotic administration during labour are less accessible.Tellingly, the highest rates of maternal GBS are found in sub-Saharan Africa -- which alone accounts for around half of the global burden -- and Eastern and South-Eastern Asia, the study showed.It suggested that a GBS vaccine that could be administered to pregnant women during routine pregnancy checkups and that reached over 70 percent of pregnant women could avert 50,000 infant and foetus deaths each year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-urges-vaccine-against-bacteria-killing-150-000-babies-each-year-101635900550693.html
03-11-2021||World||US gives final nod to Pfizer Covid-19 shots for kids aged 5 to 11||U.S. health officials on Tuesday gave the final signoff to Pfizer’s kid-size Covid-19 shot, a major expansion of the nation’s vaccination campaign.The Food and Drug Administration already authorized the shots for children ages 5 to 11 — doses just a third of the amount given to teens and adults. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends who should receive FDA-cleared vaccines.The announcement by CDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky came only hours after an advisory panel unanimously decided Pfizer’s shots should be opened to the 28 million youngsters in that age group.Millions of shots made by Pfizer and its partner BioNTech have already been shipped to states, doctors’ offices and pharmacies, to be ready for CDC's decision.An influential advisory panel on Tuesday recommended kid-size doses of Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine for all children ages 5 to 11, putting the U.S. on the brink of a major expansion of vaccinations. A final decision was expected within hours.The Food and Drug Administration already authorized the shots for the younger age group — doses just a third of the amount given to teens and adults. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention formally recommends who should receive FDA-cleared vaccines — and its advisers unanimously decided Pfizer’s shots should be opened to 28 million youngsters.If the CDC’s director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, signs off as expected, it will mark the first opportunity for Americans under 12 to get the powerful protection of any Covid-19 vaccine.“Today is a monumental day in the course of this pandemic,” Walensky told the advisory panel as it began its deliberations earlier Tuesday.She said while the risk of severe disease and death is lower in young children than adults, it is real — and that Covid-19 has had a profound social, mental health and educational impact on youngsters, including widening disparities in learning.“There are children in the second grade who have never experienced a normal school year,” Walensky said. “Pediatric vaccination has the power to help us change all of that.”Millions of shots made by Pfizer and its partner BioNTech have already been shipped to states, doctors' offices and pharmacies — in orange caps, to avoid mix-ups with purple-capped vials of adult vaccine.The American Academy of Pediatrics welcomed the vote as its members get ready to start the first injections into little arms as soon as they're given the final OK. The 5- to 11-year-olds will receive two shots, three weeks apart, the same schedule as everyone else -- but using a smaller needle.“Sharing this life-saving vaccine with our children is a huge step forward and provides us all with more confidence and optimism about the future,” said Dr. Lee Savio Beers, academy president.Many parents have clamored for vaccine protection for youngsters so they can resume normal childhood activities without risking their own health — or fear bringing the virus home to a more vulnerable family member. But CDC's advisers said they recognize many parents also have questions, and may be fearful of the vaccine because of rampant misinformation.The panelists said they want parents to ask their pediatrician about the shots — and to understand that they're far better than gambling that their child will escape a serious coronavirus infection. As for safety, more than 106 million Americans have safely gotten two doses of Pfizer’s full-strength shots — including more than 7 million 12- to 15-year-olds.“I have vaccinated my kids,” said CDC adviser Dr. Helen Keipp Talbot of Vanderbilt University, saying she wouldn’t recommend something for other families unless she was comfortable with it for her own. “We have seen the devastation of this disease.”In the U.S., there have been more than 8,300 hospitalizations of kids ages 5 to 11, about a third requiring intensive care, according to government data. The CDC has recorded at least 94 deaths in that age group, with additional reports under investigation.And while the U.S. has seen a recent downturn in Covid-19 cases, experts are worried about another uptick with holiday travel and as winter sends more activity indoors where it’s easier for the coronavirus to spread.Pfizer's study of 2,268 youngsters found the kid-size vaccine is nearly 91% effective at preventing symptomatic Covid-19 -- based on 16 diagnoses among kids given dummy shots compared to just three who got the real vaccination.The FDA examined more children, a total of 3,100 who were vaccinated, in concluding the shots are safe. The younger children experienced similar or fewer reactions -- such as sore arms, fever or achiness -- than teens or young adults get after larger doses.That study wasn’t large enough to detect any extremely rare side effects, such as the heart inflammation that occasionally occurs after the second full-strength dose, mostly in young men and teen boys. Regulators ultimately decided the benefits from vaccination outweigh the potential that younger kids getting a smaller dose also might experience that rare risk.Some of CDC's advisers said for some parents, deciding to get their children vaccinated may hinge on that small but scary risk.“The risk of some sort of bad heart involvement is much higher if you get Covid-19 than if you get this vaccine,” Dr. Matthew Oster, a pediatric cardiologist at Emory University, told the panel. “COVID is much riskier to the heart.”Last week, FDA’s advisers struggled with whether every young child needed a vaccine. Youngsters hospitalized with Covid-19 are more likely to have high-risk conditions such as obesity or diabetes. But otherwise healthy children can get seriously ill, too, and the CDC’s advisers ultimately recommended the shots for all of them — even children who’ve already recovered from a bout of Covid-19.CDC officials calculated that for every 500,000 youngsters vaccinated, between 18,000 and 58,000 Covid-19 cases — and between 80 and 226 hospitalizations — in that age group would be prevented, depending on the pandemic's trajectory. And CDC officials noted that Covid-19 has caused more deaths in this age group than some other diseases, such as chickenpox, did before children were routinely vaccinated against them.What about younger children? Pfizer is testing shots for babies and preschoolers and expects data around the end of the year. The similarly made Moderna vaccine also is being studied with young children. But the FDA still hasn't cleared its use in teens, and the company is delaying its application for younger children pending that review.A few countries have begun using other Covid-19 vaccines in children under 12, including China, which just began vaccinations for 3-year-olds. But many that use the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine are watching the U.S. decision, and European regulators just began considering the companies’ kid-size doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-gives-final-nod-to-pfizer-covid-19-shots-for-kids-aged-5-to-11-years-101635898353289.html

Modi’s visit to the Union territory comes amid a protracted encounter with terrorists in Poonch district for the past 24 days. The Prime Minister had last visited Rajouri in 2019 when he celebrated Diwali with the soldiers. “Though we await an official confirmation, PM Modi’s plan to celebrate Diwali with soldiers certainly boosts the morale of the soldiers,” an Army official said, seeking anonymity. The Union territory (UT) has lately been plagued by terrorist attacks.Five migrant workers were among 11 civilians killed in the region last month. At least nine soldiers, including two junior commissioned officers, were killed in an encounter in Poonch’s Chamrer and Nar Khas areas on October 11 and 14, respectively.The Indian Army has been conducting operations in the dense forests of the Rajouri-Poonch sector since October 11, trying to track down terrorists believed to belong to Pakistan-based terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT0 who have gone to ground in the area.Separately, an officer and a soldier were killed in a mine blast near a forward post, along the LoC, in Rajouri on October 30. In October alone, the army lost 11 soldiers south of Pir Panjal.In counter-attacks, at least 13 terrorists, including a top LeT commander, have been shot dead by security forces.Meanwhile, Army Chief General M M Naravane arrived on a two-day visit to Jammu to review the security situation and operational preparedness. General Naravane carried out aerial reconnaissance of forward areas in the Jammu region and was also briefed by commanders on ground on the prevailing security situation along the LoC.“General MM Naravane #COAS (Chief of Army Staff) is on a visit to Jammu region wherein he will be given an update on security situation & operational preparedness. #COAS will visit forward areas & interact with troops and commanders on ground,” the Additional Directorate General of Public Information (ADGPI) of the Indian Army had earlier tweeted.Earlier on October 18 and 19, the Army chief had conducted a two-day tour of the Jammu region and reviewed the ground situation and the ongoing counter-infiltration operations. Naravane also visited the border districts of Rajouri and Poonch, where a massive operation to track down terrorists hiding in the forest areas of Mendhar, Surankote and Thanamandi is underway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-likely-to-celebrate-diwali-with-soldiers-in-rajouri-101635962400574.html
03-11-2021||India||States announce petrol, diesel tax cut after Centre's excise duty move||After the Centre announced central excise duty cut on petrol and diesel on Wednesday, states too followed suit and Assam, Tripura were the first on Wednesday evening to announce tax cuts on petrol and diesel. Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma announced VAT reduction of ₹7 on both petrol and diesel with immediate effect. Tripura chief minister Biplab Deb also announced a ₹7 reduction of VAT on petrol and diesel, which will be effective from tomorrow. "A happier Diwali for the 37 lakh people of Tripura," the chief minister tweeted. After Assam and Tripura, Karnataka and Goa governments announced price reduction.Himachal Pradesh chief minister Jai Ram Thakur said the state government will issue a notification soon announcing a reduction of VAT on petrol and diesel prices.In Bihar, there will be a further reduction of state VAT by ₹1.30 on petrol and ₹1.90 on diesel apart from ₹5 and 10 ₹reduction on excise duty, Sushil Kumar Modi tweeted. Effectively, petrol will be cheaper by ₹6.30 and diesel by ₹11.90 in Bihar, he said. Union petroleum minister Hardeep Singh Puri said while the Centre's move will bring a big relief for fuel consumers, the state should also reduce VAT extending further relief to consumers. Union minister and former minister of petroleum and natural gas, Dharmendra Pradhan said the decision of the Centre to reduce excise duty on petrol and diesel sets the template for the state governments to follow suit. "Concrete action from state governments will lead to a further reduction in fuel price and more relief to consumers," he said.While the BJP-ruled states have announced VAT cut, the Congress has slammed the Centre's move by terming it as PM Modi's jumla. "In year 2021, prices of petrol were hiked by ₹28 and diesel by ₹26 per litre. After losing 14 bye-elections and 2 Lok Sabhas, reducing the petrol-diesel price by ₹5 and ₹10 is tom-tommed as 'Diwali gift' of Modi Ji! Hey Ram..." Congress leader and spokesperson Randeep Surjewala tweeted."Government of India has taken a significant decision of reducing Central Excise Duty on petrol and diesel by ₹5 and ₹10 (per litre) respectively from tomorrow. Prices of petrol and diesel will thus come down accordingly," the finance ministry said in a statement.This is the highest-ever reduction in excise duty and rolls back a part of the ₹13 and ₹16 per litre increase in taxes on petrol and diesel effected between March 2020 and May 2020 to avoid passing on to consumers the sharp fall in international oil prices, reports said.Based on April to October consumption numbers, the loss of revenue to the government due to the excise duty cut will be ₹8,700 crore per month. This totals to an annual impact of over ₹1 lakh crore, industry sources said. For the remainder of the current fiscal, the impact would be ₹43,500 crore, a PTI report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-tripura-announce-petrol-diesel-price-cut-after-centre-s-excise-move-101635960856804.html

He claimed that he returned the money to Shah Rukh's manager Pooja Dadlani through her husband.These claims take the case to a new turn as Prabhakar Sail alleged that he overheard KP Gosavi and Sam D'Souza discussing a deal of ₹18 crore. According to Prabhakar, Sam D'Souza was also present in the car where KP Gosavi and Shah Rukh's manager Pooja Dadlani discussed the deal. In his plea, D'Souza said he was not present when the discussion took place.Rahul Gandhi wrote to SRK when Aryan was in jail, said, 'Truth can't be held hostage'D'Souza left from the place to give Gosavi and Dadlani privacy and hence, was not part of their discussion, the application said, adding that when D'Souza came to know of Aryan Khan's arrest in the case the next day, he was shocked.“The applicant is an innocent person who has nothing to do with the alleged offence and he is falsely implicated by Prabhakar Sail,” it added.The plea, however, does not mention how he recovered ₹50 lakh from Gosavi and returned it to SRK's manager.According to D'Souza, Gosavi showed a list of names in which Aryan Khan's name was not present as no drug was found on her. Gosavi told Dadlani that he could have helped in the release of Aryan Khan as no drugs were found on him and when the negotiation took place, Aryan Khan was detained but not arrested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rs-50-lakh-taken-from-srk-for-aryan-s-release-was-returned-later-claims-man-linked-to-extortion-allegation-101635958529226.html

03-11-2021||India||'After losing 14 bypolls': Congress says petrol, diesel duty cut not Diwali gift, but ‘jumla’||Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala on Wednesday said the nation does not need jumlas as the Centre decided to reduce the central excise duty of ₹5 on petrol and ₹10 on diesel, a day before Diwali. "In year 2021, prices of petrol were hiked by ₹28 and diesel by ₹26 per litre. After losing 14 bye-elections and 2 Lok Sabhas, reducing the petrol-diesel price by ₹5 and ₹10 is tom-tommed as 'Diwali gift' of Modi Ji! Hey Ram..." Surjewala tweeted."In May 2014, price of petrol was ₹71.41, diesel was ₹55.49 but crude oil was $105.71 per barrel. Crude oil is $82 per barrel today. When will the prices equate year 2014?" Surjewala said. 3/3Pl see the Jumlas of “Modi-nomics”!In Year 2021, Price of Petrol were hiked by ₹28 & Diesel by ₹26/litre.After losing 14 bye elections & 2 Lok Sabhas, reducing Petrol-Diesel price by ₹5 & ₹10 is tom-tommed as ‘Diwali Gift’ of Modi Ji!Hey Ram…..#Petrol#DieselComparing the excise of petrol and diesel in the Modi government with that of the Congress government, Surjewala said the excise duty on petrol was ₹9.48 litre on petrol and ₹3.46 litre on diesel. After the reduction announced on Wednesday, the excise duty on petrol is ₹27.90 per litre and 21.80 per litre of diesel."Modi ji, Nation doesn't need jumlas. Roll back the draconian tax hike!" he wrote."Government of India has taken a significant decision of reducing Central Excise Duty on petrol and diesel by ₹5 and ₹10 (per litre) respectively from tomorrow. Prices of petrol and diesel will thus come down accordingly," the finance ministry said in a statement.This is the highest-ever reduction in excise duty and rolls back a part of the ₹13 and ₹16 per litre increase in taxes on petrol and diesel effected between March 2020 and May 2020 to avoid passing on to consumers the sharp fall in international oil prices, reports said.Based on April to October consumption numbers, the loss of revenue to the government due to the excise duty cut will be ₹8,700 crore per month. This totals to an annual impact of over ₹1 lakh crore, industry sources said. For the remainder of the current fiscal, the impact would be ₹43,500 crore, a PTI report said.Trinamool spokesperson and MP Derek O'Brien also criticised the announcement and said the excise duty of petrol was increased by 65% last year, while now the decrease amounts to 15%. "Between April to September 21, government's collection from excise on petrol rose 33% compared to last year. Collection of excise is 79% more than pre-covid levels," Derek O Brien tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-losing-14-bypolls-congress-says-petrol-diesel-duty-cut-not-diwali-gift-but-jumla-101635956361055.html
03-11-2021||India||Burnt our fingers, says MGP on alliance with BJP in Goa. There is fine print||PANAJI: Goa’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has reached out to the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) to explore the possibility of a pre-poll alliance ahead of Goa elections early next year but the regional party, which has twice helped the BJP form a government in the past, indicated it wasn’t inclined to rush into a deal.“Why should we go back to the BJP,” asked Ramkrishna aka Sudin Dhavalikar, the MGP’s only remaining legislator in the Goa assembly. The MGP won three seats in the 2017 elections and supported the BJP to form a Manohar Parrikar-led government. After Parrikar’s death, Sudin Dhavalikar made a pitch to take charge as chief minister but settled as deputy chief minister in Goa’s Pramod Sawant’s government. He was dropped from the cabinet within days of his elevation after two of his party’s MLAs crossed over to the BJP.As Union minister Nitin Gadkari, who has played a key role in sealing the BJP’s alliances with regional parties such as MGP in 2017 and later in 2019, was back in town this week. Gadkari and BJP’s election in-charge and former Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis held a series of meetings on Monday and Tuesday to solicit feedback from the party’s MLAs on possible alliances.At a media interaction, Gadkari called Dhavalikar his friend, with whom the friendship went beyond politics.“I have maintained political relations. But political relations are one thing and politics is another. I have helped them. Even if he is not aligned with the BJP, then we have personal relations,” Gadkari said on Tuesday, confirming that he was scheduled to meet Dhavalikar to “discuss and receive suggestions”.Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant went a step further and suggested that an alliance was necessary because “politics (in Goa) was leaning towards anarchy.” “I have said before also that given the type of politics that has begun to emerge -- for the first time some people have been leaning towards anarchy, then like-minded people have to come together on one forum,” Sawant said.“Regarding any possible alliance, our central leaders Amit Shah, JP Nadda, etc decide. A decision will be taken only in consultation with them. How many seats and other things, they (central leadership) decide. So, it would be wise if they (Dhavalikars) speak to them directly,” Sawant added.When asked whether MGP qualified to be a “like-minded party” Sawant said. “Of course. they were with us before.”The BJP’s focus on building alliances is seen to emanate from its Goa experience in 2017 when the party decided to go alone but ended up with just 13 seats in the 40-member house. That the BJP was still able to form the government was mostly credited to Gadkari and Manohar Parrikar, who died in 2019.The BJP is also mindful that any split in the votes between the BJP and MGP, which largely appeals to the same demography in crucial constituencies, will benefit the opposition.MGP was seen as a willing partner for the alliance on Monday when Sudin Dhavalikar declared that the MGP was willing to align with “whichever party was willing to give them 12 seats” where they have already started working on the ground and have selected their candidates.When later specifically asked about the possibility of MGP’s alliance with the BJP, Dhavalikar, who runs the party along with his brother Pandurang aka Deepak Dhavalikar who is the party boss, made it clear that their party didn’t want to rush into an alliance with the BJP.“It is true that we committed suicide (by aligning with the BJP) in the past. The alliance that we did in 2012, the BJP brought it to an end by dismissing our ministers in 2016. Despite that in 2017, we helped them form a government and again after one year or so, they had us removed. In such a situation, why will we go back to the BJP?” Sudin Dhavalikar said. But this did not mean that the Dhavalikar brothers were ruling out an alliance. Sudin left that option open, saying a final decision, which will be binding on all members, will be taken by the party’s executive committee.BJP leaders in Goa are in favour of an alliance.“We are moving in a direction in which we will be much stronger with the people... I had earlier too said that we need an alliance... but the party will ultimately decide,” state transport minister Mauvin Godinho said.The only time the BJP was able to win a majority on its own was when the party had a pre-poll alliance with the MGP back in 2012. Prior to that, the MGP was an alliance partner in the Digambar Kamat’s Congress-led coalition government between 2007 and 2012.To be sure, Dhavalikar has held meetings with Arvind Kejriwal of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) as well, but the conversations between the two parties have not materialised into much.Goa Congress leaders too have sent multiple messages to its high command on the need to have an alliance with like-minded parties. While top party leaders in Goa, who as recently as last week had visited Delhi didn’t reveal their ‘strategy’, some leaders indicated that the party has decided ‘in-principle’ to align with the Nationalist Congress Party and the Goa Forward Party, but no discussion has taken place on the number of seats or any seat sharing agreement.“We have apprised the party high command of our position and our views and until the high command takes a decision based on the discussions we have had, it would not be proper to discuss it with the media,” Goa Congress working president Aleixo Sequeira said. Elections in Goa are likely to be held sometime in February along with five other states with the BJP hoping to hold on to power while the Congress is hoping to return back to power after a gap of ten years as well as to stave of competition from the Trinamool Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party, who are both hoping for a foothold in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-hopes-to-patch-up-with-mgp-for-goa-polls-why-should-we-counters-dhavalikar-101635955621163.html

03-11-2021||India||India’s Abhinandan Varthaman, who downed Pakistan F-16, is group capt now||NEW DELHI: Abhinandan Varthaman, who was awarded Vir Chakra for shooting down a Pakistani F-16 during an aerial dogfight over the Line of Control (LoC) on February 27, 2019, picked up the rank of group captain on Wednesday morning, people familiar with the development said. A group captain is equivalent to a colonel in the army. The dogfight in which Abhinandan was involved took place a day after the Indian Air Force’s Mirage-2000s struck targets in Pakistan’s Balakot. On February 26, IAF’s Mirages hit three targets in Balakot with Israeli-origin Spice 2000 bombs with penetrator warheads that allowed the weapons to pierce through the rooftops before exploding inside to cause maximum damage. It was India’s response to the Pulwama suicide attack in Kashmir in which 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) men were killed on February 14, 2019.The following day, Pakistan’s air force retaliated.Abhinandan, then 35, scripted military aviation history by downing an F-16, seconds before his own MiG-21 Bison was hit by a missile forcing him to eject. Experts then hailed it as the first-ever kill of an F-16 by a MiG-21 Bison, fighter jets of two different generations. He was captured after he bailed out of his aircraft. Pakistan eventually returned him to India on March 1, 2019, after holding him captive for almost 60 hours. Also Read: A rare phone call, secret letter: How India got Pak to release IAF’s Abhinandan Abhinandan was a wing commander then, equivalent to a lieutenant colonel in the army.The fighter pilot is currently posted in the North-East, said one of the persons cited above. He was awarded Vir Chakra on Independence Day 2019. Vir Chakra is India’s third-highest wartime gallantry award, after Param Vir Chakra and Maha Vir Chakra. Abhinandan’s Vir Chakra citation, published in the Gazette of India in December 2019, said he courageously engaged the Pakistani aircraft package despite its “immense numerical and technological superiority,” and his aggressive manoeuvres forced the enemy aircraft into tactical chaos. In February 2019, Abhinandan was posted with a MiG-21 Bison squadron and was on ‘operational readiness platform’ duty at air force station Srinagar when a large Pakistan Air Force fighter aircraft package was detected heading towards LoC. The hostile jets were armed with advanced beyond visual range (BVR) air-to-air missiles and modern air-to-ground stand-off weapons.Abhinandan was scrambled to intercept this package five minutes after it was detected.“Displaying exceptional air combat acumen and knowledge of the enemy’s tactics, Abhinandan scanned the low altitude airspace with his airborne intercept (AI) radar and picked up an enemy aircraft that was flying low to ambush the Indian fighter interceptor aircraft… Abhinandan alerted the other formation pilots towards this surprise threat,” the citation said. “He then consolidated the riposte, by gathering his wingman in an offensive formation against the hostile Pakistani aircraft now dropping weapons on Indian Army positions. This audacious and aggressive manoeuvre forced the enemy aircraft into tactical chaos,” it further said. The citation said the wing commander pursued a retreating enemy fighter bomber aircraft and in the ensuing aerial combat, shot down an F-16. “However, in the melee, one of the enemy aircraft fired multiple advanced BVR missiles, one of which hit his aircraft forcing him to eject in enemy territory.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-abhinandan-varthaman-who-downed-pakistan-f-16-is-group-capt-now-101635951959563.html

On the eve of Diwali, the government decided to reduce the central excise duty of ₹5 on petrol and ₹10 on diesel, according to people familiar with the matter. The prices of fuel and diesel will come down accordingly across the country.The reduction in excise duty is expected to boost consumption and keep inflation low in a bid to help the poor and middle classes. The price cuts are also expected to boost economic activities across sectors - manufacturing, services or agriculture.“Today’s decision is expected to further spur the overall economic cycle,” the government said in a statement, urging states to reduce VAT on petrol and diesel to give relief to consumers.The government lauded the hard work of farmers during the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic which kept the economic growth momentum even during the nationwide lockdown. It said that the decision to reduce the excise duty on petrol and diesel will come as a “boost to the farmers during the upcoming Rabi season”. The global crude oil prices have witnessed a massive upsurge in recent months which caused a price rise of petrol and diesel in India.Amid massive price rise in crude oil globally, the world has also been witnessing a shortage of all forms of energy, especially coal. The government on Thursday said that it has made efforts to ensure that “there is no energy shortage in the country and that commodities such as petrol and diesel are available adequately to meet our requirements.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-announces-cuts-in-petrol-diesel-excise-duty-on-diwali-eve-101635950479403.html

The counter-terrorism operation is the longest in recent history and has entered its 24th day on Wednesday.“General MM Naravane #COAS (Chief of Army Staff) is on a visit to Jammu region wherein he will be given an update on security situation & operational preparedness. #COAS will visit forward areas & interact with troops and commanders on ground,” the additional directorate general of public information of the Indian Army said in a tweet.The Army chief earlier conducted a two-day tour of the Jammu region last month. Naravane reviewed the ground situation as well as the counter-terrorism operations in the area. He visited Rajouri and Poonch where the operation to nab terrorists hiding in the forest areas of Mendhar, Surankote and Thanamandi has been going on since October 11.The operation in Surankote forest began on October 11 after terrorists killed five soldiers which also included a Junior Commissioned Officer (JCO). The operation was extended to Mendhar in a bid to neutralise the fleeing terrorists where another encounter took place on October 14, leaving four soldiers, including another JCO, killed.In October, Pakistani terrorist Zia Mustafa was killed when security forces accompanying him to identify a hideout came under fire from hiding terrorists on October 24. He was shifted from Kot Bhalwal Central Jail Jammu to Mendhar on police remand for questioning in connection with the ongoing operation.The cops also arrested a terrorist associate who allegedly was linked to Mustafa and terrorist handlers across the border. They are also questioning a dozen others with connection to providing logistic support to the terrorists in the forest belt.

In a letter addressed to Shah Rukh and Gauri, the Congress MP extended his support to him and wrote, Truth cannot be held hostage for long."The letter was written on October 14, when Aryan Khan was lodged at the Arthur Road prison.It's not easy to see a loved one in such a situation, Rahul wrote adding that he was meaning to write to SRK for something. "I know that you are compassionate and created goodwill in the community. That's why I can see widespread support for your family," the letter read, according to people aware of the development.Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala, however, said if there is any such letter, it can't be made public as it was a personal exchange between Rahul Gandhi and Shah Rukh Khan.Aryan Khan was arrested on October 3 after the Narcotics Control Bureau raided a Goa-bound cruise accusing that drugs were being used at the party. Aryan Khan was invited to the party and no drugs were found on him. After spending about 22 days in Mumbai's Arthur Road Jail, Aryan Khan finally walked out of the prison on October 30, two days after the Bombay high court granted him bail on October 28.The drugs case snowballed into a major political controversy after the Nationalist Congress Party threw its weight behind Aryan Khan, with NCP leader and Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik bringing a series of allegations against NCB Mumbai zone chief Sameer Wankhede.NCP supremo Sharad Pawar and Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray too slammed the central agency for running after Bollywood. NCB is only interested in catching celebrities, clicking photos and creating some noise, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had said.On Tuesday, Rahul Gandhi tweeted in support of Virat Kohli who has been facing the wrath of social media following India's defeat against Pakistan and New Zealand.

The two flight tests have been conducted with different configurations based on satellite navigation and electro-optical sensors.The first of the two tests was conducted last Thursday. The ministry of defence said in a statement that an electro-optical seeker based flight test of this class of bomb was conducted for the first time in India. The second flight test, launched by an IAF aircraft from Chandan ranges at Jaisalmer, was conducted today."The electro-optical configuration of the system is equipped with Imaging Infra-Red (IIR) Seeker technology enhancing the precision strike capability of the weapon," the ministry added.Meant to disable airfield runways, SAAW is capable of hitting ground targets up to a range of 100 kilometres. It can carry a warhead of 125 kilograms. The defence ministry said that the weapons were smoothly released and ejected by a newly adapted launcher and the intended target was hit with high accuracy.The telemetry and tracking systems captured all mission events throughout the flight.All mission objectives were achieved in both flight tests, with advanced guidance and navigation algorithms, software performing as per the mission requirements, according to the ministry.Defence minister Rajnath Singh complimented the "synergistic efforts" of DRDO, IAF and the teams associated with the mission. Dr G Satheesh Reddy, secretary, department of defence R&D and chairman DRDO, congratulated the team saying the performance and reliability of the weapon has been proved.DRDO had last tested the anti-airfield weapon in January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drdo-iaf-conduct-2-flight-tests-of-smart-anti-airfield-weapon-within-a-week-101635943485182.html
03-11-2021||India||'Diwali of Aatmanirbhar Bharat': Health minister hails PM Modi for Covaxin's WHO approval||As Bharat Biotech's Covaxin got emergency use approval from the World Health Organization, Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Wednesday praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership and said this will be self-reliant India's Diwali this year. After a long wait for months, the emergency use approval has been granted to India's first home-grown vaccine against Covid-19, just a day before Diwali."This is a sign of capable leadership. This is the story of Modiji's resolution. This is the language of the faith of Indians. This is the Diwali of a self-reliant India," the health minister wrote thanking WHO for granting emergency use listing to Made-in-India Covaxin.The WHO approval is a major recognition of the work of the Indian scientists as this is the first vaccine against Covid-19 developed and manufactured in India. Following WHO's decision, many countries are likely to open their doors for people vaccinated with Covaxin. At the same time, it will allow Bharat Biotech to export Covaxin.Bharat Biotech started sharing data with WHO from early July and a decision was expected in October. But a delay in the process created uncertainty over Covaxin's international status.Bharat Biotech's vaccine is the seventh to win WHO backing following two mRNA shots from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, adenovirus vector vaccines developed by AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson, and China's inactivated vaccines from Sinovac Biotech and Sinopharm.The WHO's approval may also clear the way for India to commit supplies to the COVAX global vaccine sharing effort, which is co-led by the WHO and aims to provide equitable access to shots for low- and middle-income countries, Reuters said.“WHO has granted emergency use listing (EUL) to #COVAXIN® (developed by Bharat Biotech), adding to a growing portfolio of vaccines validated by WHO for the prevention of #COVID19. The Technical Advisory Group, convened by WHO and made up of regulatory experts from around the world, has determined that the #Covaxin vaccine meets WHO standards for protection against #COVID19, that the benefit of the vaccine far outweighs risks & the vaccine can be used. #Covaxin vaccine was also reviewed by WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE), and recommended use of this vaccine in two doses, with a dose interval of four weeks, in all age groups 18 and above. Available data on vaccination of pregnant women with the #Covaxin vaccine are insufficient to assess vaccine safety or efficacy in pregnancy; studies in pregnant women are planned, including a pregnancy sub-study and a pregnancy registry,” WHO tweeted.External affairs minister S Jaishankar said the move is a global recognition to PM Modi's vision of an ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’.Welcome @WHO’s decision to grant Emergency Use Listing to #COVAXIN. It facilitates travel for many Indian citizens and contributes to vaccine equity. Also a global recognition to PM @narendramodi’s vision of an #AtmanirbharBharat. A Happier Diwali.WHo director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus expressed his gladness to see another vaccine getting emergency use listing by the WHO.

The Uttar Pradesh government will take out a four-day Mata Annapurna Devi Yatra beginning in New Delhi on November 11 to take the idol to Varanasi.Chief minister Yogi Adityanath who, along with Union minister for tourism and culture G Kishan Reddy, spoke to media persons here on Wednesday, gave the detailed programme of the yatra apparently provides an opportunity to the BJP government to reach out to the people ahead of the 2022 UP assembly election.Yogi Adityanath said senior ministers of the state government Suresh Rana and Neelkanth Tiwari will receive the idol at a programme in New Delhi on November 11. He said the ministers in charge of the respective districts will welcome the idol as the yatra makes its way to Varanasi on November 14.The Archeological Survey of India (ASI) received the idol in New Delhi on October 15. The idol was part of the University of Regina’s collection at its Mackenzie Art Gallery when it was handed over by the university vice chancellor to India’s high commissioner to Ottawa (Canada), Ajay Bisaria last year.The chief minister said the idol passed through many hands before reaching the Canadian university and the Uttar Pradesh government was getting it back following the efforts of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.“Baba Vishwanath temple and Maa Annapurna have a unique connection. Maa Annapurna is believed to provide food to Baba Kashi Vishwanath and every pilgrim visiting the place gets the same as ‘prasad’ from there,” said Yogi Adityanath. Yogi Adityanath said the idol’s journey will begin from New Delhi on Gopashtami falling on November 11 and the idol will be installed at the Kashi Vishwanath temple, Varanasi, on Devotthan Ekadashi falling on November 15.“I offer my gratitude to the Prime Minister for this. Gopashtami falls on November 11 and to receive the idol on this day will be auspicious. The yatra beginning from New Delhi will pass through Ghaziabad, Gautam Buddha Nagar, Bulandshahr and Hathras, and make a night halt at Soron in Kasganj. The yatra will then cover Etah, Mainpur, Kannuaj and stop for the night at Tapeshwari Devi temple in Kanpur Nagar. Next, the idol will be taken to Ram Janmabhoomi, Ayodhya via Unnao, Lucknow and Barabanki. After staying for the night at Ayodhya, the yatra will cover Sultanpur, Pratapgarh, Jaunpur and reach Varanasi on November 14,” said Yogi Adityanath.Yogi Adityanath also said with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s efforts India’s heritage has made a place for itself in the world. Besides the International Yoga Day celebrated on June 12, the Prayagaraj Kumbh has also made a mark, the chief minister said.He said Ayurveda has also received worldwide recognition during the Covid-19 pandemic.For his part, Union minister Reddy said, “We have received an idol of goddess Maa Annapurna Devi from Canada. We identified the idol through an Indo-Canada artist at the MacKenzie Art Gallery of the University of Regina, Canada. Prime Minister Narendra Modi made efforts for getting the idol back from Canada. Our Prime Minister spoke to the Canadian Prime Minister on phone and the request for returning the idol was made as the idol is very important to us. External affairs minister S. Jaishankar and the Archeological Survey of India (ASI) also got in touch with the government of Canada to get the idol back from there,” said Reddy.“The Prime Minister wants this idol back at the place from where this was stolen. I spoke to chief minister Yogi Adityanath on behalf of the Union government,” he said.Reddy said the Union government has received 55 idols and paintings from abroad. A total of 42 out of the 55 idols, taken out of India in the British period, have been received after Prime Minister Narendra Modi assumed office in 2014, he said. The minister also said another 157 idols and paintings have been identified.“The Prime Minister went to USA recently and about 100 artworks are in the process of being brought back from there,” he said. Reddy said other countries where the artworks have been identified include Singapore, Australia, UK, Switzerland and Belgium.“Yes, we should definitely bring such idols back to our country. Taking out yatra is a good way to connect with the people ahead of polls,” said SK Dwivedi, former professor in the political science department at Lucknow University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/annapurna-idol-to-reach-varanasi-s-kashi-vishwanath-temple-after-4-day-yatra-101635945418997.html

Union home minister Amit Shah formally launched the international flight on October 23 when he travelled to Jammu and Kashmir, his first visit in two years.“It is true that we have to avoid the airspace of Pakistan now. It has increased the time of the flight by around 45 minutes,” the airline official said. The flight now takes 4 hours and 15 minutes. News agency PTI said it will fly over Gujarat.The longer flying time will eventually make the plane ticket more expensive, he added.Srinagar international airport director Kuldeep Singh declined to comment on Pakistan’s decision to bar the international flight or the longer route. But he stressed that the flight on the Srinagar-Sharjah route has a “full load of travellers”.“People are very enthusiastic about this direct flight... We are following all the Covid protocols,” he said.In view of the response, more flights have been added. “According to the new schedule, a flight will be leaving for Sharjah every day and back,” Singh said. In the initial days, there were four flights a week.Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister and National Conference vice president Omar Abdullah said the decision not to allow the flight to overfly Pakistan was unfortunate.“Very unfortunate. Pakistan did the same thing with the Air India Express flight from Srinagar to Dubai in 2009-2010. I had hoped that @GoFirstairways being permitted to overfly Pak airspace was indicative of a thaw in relations but alas that wasn’t to be,” he said in a tweet.People’s Democratic Party president Mehbooba Mufti criticised the central government for not doing the groundwork before the start of the flight. “Puzzling that GOI didn’t even bother securing permission from Pakistan to use its airspace for international flights from Srinagar. Only PR extravaganza without any groundwork,” she said.It was in 2009 that the first international flight took off from Srinagar Airport to Dubai after being inaugurated by UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi. But the optimism did not last long as all international flights were grounded owing to various reasons including objections by Pakistan over the use of its airspace.Omar Abdullah did anticipate Pakistan’s refusal the day the first flight took off from Srinagar.“Regarding the Srinagar-Sharjah flight that has been announced today - has Pakistan had a change of heart & allowed flights originating from Srinagar to use its airspace? If not, then this flight will die the way the Srinagar-Dubai flight died during UPA2,” he said on October 23.“Because of Pakistan’s cussed refusal to allow flights originating from Srinagar to use its airspace the SXR-DXB flight had to take a ‘technical halt’ in Delhi or had to fly south & go around Pakistan airspace. This made the flight completely unviable both in terms of cost & time,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pak-refuses-to-let-srinagar-sharjah-flight-use-airspace-unfortunate-says-omar-101635943558819.html

This marks a major victory for India's journey in vaccination against Covid-19. Covaxin is a vaccine, completely 'made in India', by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech and the Indian Council of Medical Research. The emergency listing got delayed last month as the technical advisory group sought some additional clarification from Bharat Biotech for its final risk assessment. The technical advisory group met on Wednesday to take the final call, and Covaxin has been recommended for emergency use listing.As Covaxin awaits WHO approval, here's list of countries where it is clearedThe technical advisory group is an independent advisory body that provides recommendations to WHO for approval of vaccines. The team met last October 26 and sought additional clarifications from Bharat Biotech which the company submitted. The team went through those data on Wednesday and gave its nod that Covaxin can be listed for emergency use under the EUL procedure.Covaxin has demonstrated 77.8 per cent effectiveness against symptomatic COVID-19 and 65.2 per cent protection against the new Delta variant. Bharat Biotech said that it concluded the final analysis of Covaxin efficacy from Phase 3 trials. WHO has so far approved Covid-19 vaccines of Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca-SK Bio/Serum Institute of India, Johnson 7 Johnson - Janssen, Moderna, and Sinopharm for emergency use.What's the next step?The go-ahead from the technical team can be considered as getting approval from WHO and the world body has also announced it on its social media platform.“WHO has granted emergency use listing (EUL) to #COVAXIN® (developed by Bharat Biotech), adding to a growing portfolio of vaccines validated by WHO for the prevention of #COVID19. The Technical Advisory Group, convened by WHO and made up of regulatory experts from around the world, has determined that the #Covaxin vaccine meets WHO standards for protection against #COVID19, that the benefit of the vaccine far outweighs risks & the vaccine can be used. #Covaxin vaccine was also reviewed by WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE), and recommended use of this vaccine in two doses, with a dose interval of four weeks, in all age groups 18 and above. Available data on vaccination of pregnant women with the #Covaxin vaccine are insufficient to assess vaccine safety or efficacy in pregnancy; studies in pregnant women are planned, including a pregnancy sub-study and a pregnancy registry,” WHO tweeted.

Learning from it, steps will be taken to make necessary improvements so that lotus blooms once again in 2022,” Thakur was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.On the BJP losing seats in Bengal, Thakur highlighted that the bypolls are held on local issues. He also pointed out that the BJP was victorious in Assam, Madhya Pradesh and secured 1 seat in Karnataka. “It's too early to say anything. Results came in different states of the country. The BJP won all 5 seats in Assam, we won in MP and won 1 out of 2 seats in Karnataka. Every state has its own local issues for bypolls, every political party brainstorms over it. We'll do too,” Thakur said. The party was also victorious in Telangana’s Huzurabad bypoll.Congress swept the Himachal Pradesh bypolls as the BJP lost the Mandi Lok Sabha seat to Pratibha Singh, wife of late former chief minister Virbhadra Singh. Pratibha Singh’s win could have given Congress a possible chief ministerial face ahead of the polls in the northern state where polls will be held next December.Congress also won the Arki, Fatehpur and Jubbal-Kotkhai constituencies. In other states, Congress won one assembly seat in Karnataka, won two assembly seats in Rajasthan and managed to retain Raigaon assembly constituency in Madhya Pradesh. The BJP made gains in Assam and Madhya Pradesh but lost ground in West Bengal as Trinamool Congress swept the bypolls in all four seats.Earlier on Tuesday, BJP leader and Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai made similar observations and said that the BJP will look seriously into the defeat in Karnataka after BJP lost the Hangal assembly seat to Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/well-brainstorm-anurag-thakur-says-bjp-will-look-into-himachal-bypoll-defeat-101635939203068.html

"This approval of shelf-life extension is based on the availability of additional stability data, which was submitted to CDSCO. The shelf life extension has been communicated to our stakeholders," the company said. The present shelf life of this Covid-19 vaccine is six months which means that the vaccines can be used till six months from the date of manufacture if stored at two to eight degree celsius. Now, the vaccine doses can be stored for up to a year, provided the temperature condition is fulfilled.Early this year, Bharat Biotech sought an extension of the shelf life of the vaccine and submitted real-time stability data for consideration.As Covaxin awaits WHO approval, here's list of countries where it is clearedThe extension of shelf life will reduce wastage of the vaccine as shelf life of six months means if the vaccine remains unused within the six months from the date of manufacture, they are considered to be expired. Now, Covaxin doses are good for use up to one year from the date of manufacture.Covaxin is yet to get the emergency use approval from the World Health Organization, the delay of which has spread apprehension among travellers as Covaxin is not accepted in many countries as it is still waiting for WHO's nod. WHO sought some additional clarifications from Bharat Biotech for Covaxin to conduct a final "risk-benefit assessment" for Emergency Use Listing.Countries are independently recognising Covaxin and Australia and Guyana are the latest two countries to have approved Covaxin.

The BJP, however, managed to win in the Sindgi assembly segment as it wrested the seat from the Janata Dal (Secular).Congress' Srinivas Mane won by a margin of 7,373 votes defeating his closest rival Shivaraj Sajjanar of the BJP in Hangal. Mane secured 87,490 votes. In Sindgi, Ramesh Bhusanur of the BJP defeated Congress' Ashok Managuli by a margin of 31,185 votes. Bhusanur won by a margin of 31,185 votes.The bypolls in Singi and Hangal were necessitated due to deaths of JD(S) legislators MC Managuli and CM Udasi, respectively.Karnataka chief minister Basavraj Bommai said he is taking the Hangal defeat seriously and all steps to convert the loss into a win will be taken. Bommai campaigned extensively in the Shiggaon assembly segment in Haveri district, which is his constituency and neighbours Hangal, and the loss is seen as a setback to the new chief minister of Karnataka.“Elections are won and lost. These by-elections are fought on particular time and issues, and its outcome is not a complete verdict. However, I have taken this election setback very seriously and we will do all the corrections,” Bommai was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.“We will take the loss seriously and take all the necessary measures politically and administratively to convert the loss into win,” he added. The bypolls were the first major electoral change following his taking charge as Karnataka chief minister.Bommai, however, said that Congress candidate Mane worked for the people during the Covid-19 pandemic, attributing his work as a reason behind his win. “The winning candidate from Congress Srinivas Maane has also done some work at the time of the Covid-19 pandemic, for which people of Hangal supported him,” Bommai was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-bypolls-bjp-wins-sindgi-bommai-says-taking-hangal-defeat-seriously-101635874023483.html
03-11-2021||India||‘Har Ghar Dastak’: Modi rolls out door-to-door Covid-19 vaccination campaign||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday launched a month-long “Har Ghar Dastak” campaign for special house-to-house Covid-19 vaccination focussed on those whose second dose is overdue to accelerate the inoculation drive.“So far you have had been making efforts to safely administer Covid vaccine doses at the vaccination centres. Now the time has come to focus your efforts towards house-to-house visits to ensure you cover those who have not been vaccinated as yet,” said Narendra Modi after launching the campaign at a review of 45 districts with low first-dose vaccination coverage across 11 states and a union territory. Chief ministers of states with poorly performing districts, along with the local administrators, were present at the review. “Har Ghar Dastak” literally means “a knock on every door”.Also Read: Dharavi records zero fresh Covid-19 cases on six days in October“During this house-to-house campaign, along with those who are yet to receive their first dose, you all must also focus on administering the second dose. When disease transmission comes down, the feeling of urgency also tends to come down. People start thinking what is the hurry, we will get jabbed later,” said Modi.He added there should be no laxity in the pace of Covid vaccination after having administered one billion doses. Modi asked officials to ensure the vaccination coverage is widened by the end of the year and to enter the new year with renewed self-belief and confidence. He said people have found innovative solutions to problems due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Modi called for a need to also find innovative solutions to complete vaccination in the remotest regions. He said if required, use songs and jingles to customise plans to vaccinate eligible population in the low coverage regions. Narendra Modi added the challenges could be many such as difficult, hard-to-reach terrain, or limited resources but many such districts have crossed those hurdles successfully. He referred to his meeting with Pope Francis in the Vatican City and emphasised the need for taking the help of religious leaders in spreading awareness and encouraging people to get vaccinated. Modi also spoke about vaccine hesitancy and the local factors behind it.“Develop micro strategies, keeping in mind the experience so far to go for saturation of vaccination by addressing the gaps at local level… You will have to do your best to take your districts nearer the national average,” he said.He urged the district officials to take the help of local religious leaders, especially in fighting ill-founded rumours that can be detrimental in ensuring all eligible beneficiaries get vaccinated sooner.The districts that have covered less than 50% of the adult population with at least one shot of the vaccine, and those with low coverage of the second dose were covered in the review.Modi said under the free-vaccine-for-all campaign, India created a record of administering about 25 million vaccine doses in a day, a feat that bears testimony to India’s capabilities.According to the Prime Minister’s Office, 45 districts in India still lag in vaccination coverage as they are yet to administer even a single shot to more than half of the adult population when the national average is at least 78%.These districts include six in Arunachal Pradesh; one each in Assam, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Mizoram, Tamil Nadu, Delhi; eight each in Jharkhand, Manipur, Nagaland; five in Maharashtra; and four in Meghalaya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/har-ghar-dastak-modi-rolls-out-door-to-door-covid-19-vaccination-campaign-101635934737853.html
03-11-2021||India||Assam Congress plans party revitalisation after assembly bypolls debacle||The Congress party won eight assembly and one Lok Sabha seat in the recently concluded by polls to 30 assembly and three Lok Sabha seats spread across the country. However, the party returned a blank in Assam, where all the five assembly seats contested went to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its ally the United Peoples’ Party Liberal (UPPL). The state unit of the Congress is now planning to reorganise itself and review the reasons for the loss. While candidates from the BJP and its ally UPPL won by huge margins ranging from 25,641 votes (Bhabanipur) and 57,059 (Tamulpur), Congress candidates, who came second on three seats, failed to garner enough votes. Congress was the only party to have fielded candidates on all five seats and had declared that it will win at least two seats. Incidentally, two of the three winning BJP candidates, Rupjyoti Kurmi (Mariani) and Sushanta Borgohain (Thawra), had won on Congress tickets in May this year before they switching sides to the ruling party, barely months after the assembly polls. “Just because we lost the bypolls, it doesn’t mean we will forget our role as opposition. We will continue to raise issues related to the people like price rise,” Assam Congress president Bhupen Kumar Borah said. Borah, who was named the Congress’s state unit chief after the party’s loss in the assembly polls, said he didn’t have much time to reorganise the outfit. “I have been in office for just 100 days. Unlike earlier, when the entire state unit was reorganised after appointment of a new chief, we couldn’t do it this time due to the by polls. Since the b ypolls are now over, we will start forming our sub-committees immediately,” he said. Also Read | NE people reposed faith in PM Modi’s leadership: Assam CM after bypoll winFor the by polls, the Congress decided to break with nine other alliance partners including the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) and Bodoland Peoples Front (BPF). “The results show that our decision to break away from the alliance was a good one. People know that even before a formal break up, BPF had announced parting of ways,” Borah tried to justify the decision. “We will start preparations for 2024 general elections and 2026 assembly polls from now on. We will work day and night, and we have started a campaign to enlist 3.3 million members. A detailed discussion with senior party leaders will soon take place to find the reasons for the by poll loss,” he added. Borah said the party would try to contest on its own on all 126 assembly seats in the state in future. He added that since Congress has an understanding with the Asom Jatiya Parishad, it will support the regional outfit in by poll to the Majuli assembly seat, scheduled later. With Tuesday’s wins, BJP’s strength in the 126-member house has increased to 62 while ruling allies, UPPL and Asom Gana Parishad have 16 legislators each. Opposition Congress, which ruled Assam for three consecutive terms from 2001 to 2016, has 27 MLAs. AIUDF has 15, BPF has 3 while the CPM and the newly floated Raijor Das have 1 seat each.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-congress-plans-party-revitalisation-after-assembly-by-polls-debacle-101635934497770.html
03-11-2021||India||Can the affordable Realme TechLife Air Purifier counter indoor pollution?||Soon after the festival season, as the weather will change and the mercury will dip with the onset of winter, we will face the problem of air pollution. Unlike in other seasons, pollutants will remain trapped in the air. While we cannot do much about the outdoors, there is some hope for the indoors. We spend a lot of hours at home – and it’s quite a lot these days. Air purifiers do provide significant respite inside homes, for all the polluted air that’ll stream in, merging with indoor pollutants such as pollen and fumes, making it a deadly cocktail. Just ahead of what we dismally refer to as the “pollution season”, Realme is making an early move into the air purifier space in India. The Realme TechLife Air Purifier, priced at ₹6,999, will likely make Philips, Honeywell and Xiaomi sit up and take notice. The Realme TechLife Air Purifier’s design does remind us of the larger design language of air purifiers made by Blueair, the Swedish air quality experts. Maybe it’s the contours, maybe it’s the mix of curves and straight lines. This purifier isn’t very tall while the clean air emerges from the top and there are touch controls on the panel within the circumference of the clean air vent. Also Read: Crackers or not, Diwali to plunge air into ‘very poor’ range in DelhiYou may be wondering if this design of the clean air vent will hamper the flow of air from the purifier. Rest assured, it has similar total coverage area as a Philips 2000 series air purifier. In fact, Realme insists that the Air Duct Design on the inside allows more clean air to be churned out. We didn’t see this struggling to spread clean air. The front panel is removable, and that’s where you access the filters from. It is pretty much par for the course that there is a prefilter and a HEPA filter that the air will pass through on its way out. The prefilter is essential to capture the larger dust particles, lest the HEPA filter layer does that job, which will mean it’ll get clogged sooner. The pre-filter can be washed. The HEPA filter itself is a high-efficiency H12 grade spec, which theoretically is among the most capable filters for home air purifiers. These will capture particles as large as or larger than 0.3 microns. A thick filter is what the Realme TechLife Air Purifier uses, which is good since there is more filter for the pollution and particulate to pass through. It will still be some time before it’ll reach that stage, but there are claims that this can last as much as 2,800 hours of use. That will vary significantly based on how polluted your home gets from time to time. Realme has used air quality sensors made by Sharp, to keep tabs on your room’s air quality PM 2.5 levels, also marked as AQI or Air Quality Index. Sharp itself makes very capable air purifiers, which most certainly gives the Realme TechLife Air Purifier a solid foundation to build on. A simple guide - if the air quality in your room is good, the light will be green; if it is moderate, that’ll be yellow; and red, as the colour suggests, is a red flag for bad air quality. You have the choice of leaving this on the auto mode and letting the sensors alter the fan speed and power based on these readings. Or you can simply select one of the three fan speeds manually. A timer lets you set this to turn off after two, four or eight hours. And the Sleep mode, as the name indicates, quietens things down so that even the faint whirring of the fan inside the purifier doesn’t bother you in the silence of the night. In our testing experience with the Realme TechLife Air Purifier, which incidentally is coinciding with a steady increase in pollution and a decrease in ambient air quality, this does seem very sensitive and reactive to even the slightest of AQI changes. Crack open a window for about 30 seconds, after the Realme TechLife Air Purifier has stabilised the air in the room, and this immediately detects a new pocket of air, and speeds up if need be. Testing this with a Laser Egg 2 air quality monitor, this takes 15 minutes to bring down the AQI readings from 123 microgram/cubic meter (ug/m3) to a steady 24 ug/m3. The fan is audible when it is at its max speed, while there is a gentle hum at medium speed and it is barely audible at the lowest fan speed. What’ll definitely count as a miss is the lack of a smartness quotient. And by that, we mean the lack of any Wi-Fi connectivity that would allow for smartphone control. Mind you, it isn’t exactly common in this price range, but the Xiaomi Mi Air Purifier 2S (around ₹8,999) has it. While there are variables such as how long the HEPA filter would last and how well this holds up when the brunt of bad pollution becomes a reality in the peak of winter, there is no doubt that the Realme TechLife Air Purifier is building the blocks of experience on a solid foundation. The thick HEPA filter layer, the air quality sensors made by Sharp and a design that blends into the background in your room, are positives. As is the price tag.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/can-the-affordable-realme-techlife-air-purifier-counter-indoor-pollution-101635932758077.html

September had five days when not even a single Covid case was registered in the Dharavi slums. So far, Dharavi has recorded a total of 7,148 Covid-19 cases and has 21 active patients at present. The highest single day spike last month saw seven fresh Covid-19 cases registered on October 8. In comparison, neighbouring Dadar recorded over 200 Covid-19 infections in October, and Mahim registered over 130 cases. So far, Dadar has recorded 10,379 Covid-19 cases including 88 active cases at present; and Mahim has recorded 10,692 infections with 89 active cases at present.

Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav is getting all support from them. Akhilesh is getting 'sanrakshan aur sujhav' (patronage and advice) from the ISI. It is possible that he might also be getting economic support from it," Shukla, who a BJP leader, said.Shukla's remarks come after Yadav in a speech in Hardoi on Sunday spoke of Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Jawaharlal Nehru and Pakistan founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah in the same breath as leaders who fought for India's independence."To appease Muslims, Yadav had performed 'namaz' and observed 'roza' (fast). He can also go for 'matantaran' (religious conversion) and 'khatna' to get their votes," he said, adding that the former chief minister was doing so at the behest of Pakistan.In his speech, Yadav praised India's 'Iron Man' Vallabhbhai Patel on his 146th birth anniversary but raised eyebrows when he appeared to equate the four leaders, including Jinnah."On the directions of the ISI, Yadav is glorifying Jinnah. He is issuing such statements that Pakistan and the Taliban want," Shukla, who is the minister of state for parliamentary affairs, alleged.He claimed that Yadav's comparison of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel with Jinnah was condemnable and that he should regret it.During the public meeting in Hardoi, the SP leader had said, "Sardar Patel, Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and (Muhammad Ali) Jinnah studied in the same institute and became barristers. They helped (India) get freedom and never backed away from any struggle."Yadav had also referred to the ban imposed on the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh by Patel, the then home minister, following the assassination of Gandhi in 1948.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/akhilesh-yadav-getting-advice-economic-support-from-pakistan-s-isi-up-minister-101635929203830.html
03-11-2021||India||Pakistan refuses use of its airspace for Srinagar-Sharjah flights: Reports||Pakistan has refused to allow Go First's Srinagar-Sharjah flight to fly in its airspace, news agency ANI reported. The matter has been reported to ministries concerned, including the civil aviation ministry, the external affairs ministry and the home ministry, the agency reported. During his recent visit to the Valley, Union home minister Amit Shah flagged off the first flight from Srinagar to Sharjah, an international route which was revived almost after 11 years. According to reports, the first international flight from Srinagar to Dubai commenced in 2009 by Air India Express, but it was eventually discontinued.PM Modi's plane flies over Pakistan airspace, to return from Italy via same routeNational Conference leader and former J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah said the development is very unfortunate. "Pakistan did the same this with teh Air India Express flight from Srinagar to Dubai in 2009-2010. I had hoped that GoFirst airways being permitted to overfly Pak airspace was indicative of a thaw in relations but alas that wasn't to be," Abdullah tweeted on Wednesday.PDP president Mehbooba Mufi slammed the government and said flagging the flight off was only a ‘PR extravaganza without any groundwork’. “Puzzling that GOI didn’t even bother securing permission from Pakistan to use its airspace for international flights from Srinagar. Only PR extravaganza without any groundwork,” she tweeted. Puzzling that GOI didn’t even bother securing permission from Pakistan to use its airspace for international flights from Srinagar. Only PR extravaganza without any groundwork. https://t.co/3Cbj91C6PbThe withdrawal of the permission comes at a time when the Pakistan government is allowing Prime Minister Narendra Modi's special VVIP flight to use its airspace. In PM Modi's recent visit to Italy for the G20 summit, PM Modi's flight flew over the Pakistani airspace and came back using the same route. In September, when PM Modi flew to Washington, his flight was allowed to use Pakistan's airspace.India also allowed Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan's flight to use India's airspace when he was flying to Sri Lanka. Because of Pakistan’s cussed refusal to allow flights originating from Srinagar to use its airspace the SXR-DXB flight had to take a ‘technical halt’ in Delhi or had to fly south & go around Pakistan airspace. This made the flight completely unviable both in terms of cost & time.On October 23, when the Srinagar-Sharjah flight was announced open, Omar Abdullah expressed doubt over whether Pakistan has indeed changed its heart and allowed Indian flight to enter its airspace. "Regarding the Srinagar-Sharjah flight that has been announced today - has Pakistan had a change of heart & allowed flights originating from Srinagar to use its airspace? If not then this flight will die the way the Srinagar-Dubai flight died during UPA2," he tweeted."Because of Pakistan’s cussed refusal to allow flights originating from Srinagar to use its airspace the SXR-DXB flight had to take a ‘technical halt’ in Delhi or had to fly south & go around Pakistan airspace. This made the flight completely unviable both in terms of cost & time," he had added.As the flight was allowed to use Pakistani airspace, Abdullah had tweeted that satellite image and wrote, "Good to see the refusal of airspace usage is a thing of the past. Perhaps there is hope for relations between the two countries."Now that the permission has been reportedly withdrawn, the flight is taking a longer route over Rajasthan, Gujarat to fly to Dubai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-refuses-use-of-its-airspace-for-srinagar-sharjah-flights-reports-101635929234192.html

The move comes amid privacy issues, negative public perception, and the company’s plans to focus on the metaverse.“This change will represent one of the largest shifts in facial recognition usage in the technology’s history,” said Jerome Pesenti, Meta’s vice-president, artificial intelligence.As with most Meta things, the shutdown of the face recognition algorithms will not be immediate. It will happen sometime over the next few weeks.Facebook has built possibly the world’s largest repository of digital photos anywhere in the world, and the corresponding facial recognition algorithms at work all these years give it precise data of who is who.Also Read: Facebook’s ‘metaverse’ can take up to 15 years, says senior executiveThe feature was first introduced in December 2010, and it automatically suggested tags for people in photos uploaded on Facebook. In 2019, Facebook switched the feature to opt-in. Earlier this year, Facebook paid $650 million in settlement for a lawsuit that said the company’s face recognition algorithms violated the biometric privacy law in the US state of Illinois.Meta has said over a third of its daily active users opted to enable the face recognition setting and were able to be recognised. It has not said it will delete more than a billion individual facial recognition templates.“Looking ahead, we still see facial recognition technology as a powerful tool, for example, for people needing to verify their identity or to prevent fraud and impersonation. We believe facial recognition can help for products like these with privacy, transparency, and control in place, so you decide if and how your face is used,” said Pesenti.Meta has said it will continue working on these technologies and engaging outside experts.Till now, Facebook is believed to have only used the facial recognition data within its platform. The functionalities included the ability to gain access to a locked Facebook account.Facebook has bungled with user data privacy. A whistle-blower last month highlighted the issues related to content moderation and Facebook’s interest in elections in certain countries. They have raised concerns over the facial recognition data it has amassed over the years.Meta’s decision does not change what independent companies such as Clearview AI and others can continue to do: scrape photos and videos off the internet including social media platforms to develop and train their own facial recognition algorithms. Clearview AI claims to be the world’s largest facial recognition platform and has a database of over three million images indexed from the internet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/facebook-to-shut-down-face-recognition-for-photo-tagging-101635928799223.html

The Prime Minister hailed the hard work done by healthcare workers, but said this is not the time to relax."The progress made so far is due to your hard work. Every member of administration, ASHA workers worked a lot. They walked for miles and took vaccination to remote locations. But if we become lax after one billion (doses), a new crisis can come," PM Modi said."They say one must never underestimate disease and enemies. They have to be fought against till the very end. So, I would want that we should not bring even a slight laxity," he added.The meeting was attended by several chief ministers. It was called to discuss situation with district magistrates (DMs) from districts where less than 50% of the adult population has received at least one shot of a Covid-19 vaccine, and also those ones that have very low second-dose number. The 40 districts are spread across Jharkhand, Manipur, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Maharashtra and Meghalaya, among other states, according to the Prime Minister's Office."In this biggest pandemic in 100 years, nation faced several challenges. A significant thing in nation's fight against Corona was that we found out new solutions, used innovative methods," he told the officials and he asked them to work on innovative methods to increase the vaccination rate in their respective areas."You will have to remember that the states that have achieved the goal of administering 100% first dose of vaccine, also faced different challenges in many areas. There were challenges of geographical situation, resources but these districts overcame those challenges to go ahead," PM Modi said.Further speaking, PM Modi also suggested officials to form different strategy each town and a village. He also asked them to constitute a team of 20-25 people in their areas to execute the door-to-door vaccination policy."We can also try to have a healthy competition in the teams you have formed," he also suggested."So far you've been working to take people to vaccination centres, now it's time to reach every house for door-to-door vaccine... You can take help of local religious leaders to spread awareness about Covid vaccines, fight rumours," PM Modi told district officials.On Tuesday, India's overall vaccination coverage exceeded 1.07 billion (107,25,41,626), the Union ministry of health and family welfare said on Tuesday. The authorities inoculated more than 37 lakh (37,38,574) vaccine doses in a single day (on November 2) till 7pm.

Shailesh Pandey, who represents Bilaspur assembly constituency, also demanded removal of the Bilaspur collector, Saransh Mittar, in his November 2 letter to the CM. “This act of the collector amounts to insult of people and the government and it comes under the category of sedition,” he said in his letter. “The collector Saransh Mittar is continuously insulting your (Baghel) government and elected representatives. As per your direction, Rajyotsav programme was held in all district headquarters on November 1 …The state government sent the list of persons who were to be chief guests ….The MLA (member of the legislative assembly) of the ruling party was not invited (as guests) at the function here. Even MLAs of the opposition party should have been invited. Other public representatives like the mayor, chairman of Zilla Panchayat were also not invited by mentioning their names on the invitation card (as guests of the function),” the letter stated. Parliamentary secretary Indrashah Mandavi, an MLA from Mohla-Manpur, was the chief guest at the Rajyotsav event in Bilaspur and no other person’s name was mentioned as guests on the invitation card. A senior IAS official said that the MLA’s demand was weird“ It was a General Administrative Department ( GAD) programme , which sent a list of dignitaries to the collector . As per the list, the collector puts name on the invitation card. The collector had sent an invitation to MLA and others for the programme, hence it is not a case of disrespect,” said the officer, preferring anonymity.

Chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, while speaking to Aaj Tak, indicated that Kishor may be brought on board.Also Read | BJP will remain powerful for decades, predicts poll strategist Prashant KishorChanni said that he has been told by the party's Punjab affairs in-charge Harish Chaudhary to share the Congress' strategy with Kishor, who in the past has been involved in election campaigns of many parties.Channi further told Aaj Tak that the direction has come from the high command.Kishor is currently lobbying for the Trinamool Congress (TMC) for the upcoming Goa assembly elections. He had recently announced that he was taking a "temporary break" from active role in public life.Channi's statement has brought the spotlight back on Kishor, who announced his retirement from election management on May 2, the day the Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress whose election work he was handling scored a resounding victory in West Bengal.Kishor was appointed as the principal adviser by former Punjab chief minister Captain Amaridner Sigh but he resigned from the post.Kishor, or “PK” as he is often called in political circles, had worked with the Congress in Punjab in the 2017 assembly polls with Amarinder as the state unit president, who wanted him to again manage the party's campaign in next year's assembly elections.The poll strategist was seen as the brain behind the "Coffee with Captain" and "Punjab da Captain" that had worked well for the Congress party and the CM face in 2017. "PK & his team and their work were absolutely critical to our victory in Punjab!" Amarinder had tweeted after the party’s victory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-prashant-kishor-help-congress-in-punjab-polls-channi-drops-hint-101635924485132.html

03-11-2021||India||'Honours are even': Chidambaram's 'thought-provoking analysis' of bypoll results||Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram on Wednesday reacted to the outcome of the by-poll elections in 30 assembly constituencies and noted that the results show "the honours are even" today between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the opposition parties. The veteran politician also wondered about the mood of the voters in the 2022 elections in various states including Uttar Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh."Here is a thought provoking analysis of the results of by-elections in 30 assembly constituencies," Chidambaram wrote on Twitter while noting, "BJP won 7 seats and its declared allies won 8 seats. Congress won 8 seats. Non-BJP parties won 7 seats of which only 1 seat was won by a crypto ally of the BJP, namely YSR Congress. The other 6 seats were won by parties opposed to the BJP.""The honours are even today. Which way will the wind blow in 2022? " he then asked, posing a challenge for the BJP ahead of assembly elections in key states next year, including the politically crucial Uttar Pradesh and Punjab.The BJP and its allies on Tuesday won 14 assembly seats while the Congress bagged eight out of 29 seats in the latest round of bypolls, with results mostly favouring ruling parties in the states except in Himachal Pradesh, where the BJP lost all three assembly seats and the prestigious Mandi Lok Sabha constituency to the Congress. In West Bengal as well, BJP's arch-rival Trinamool Congress won all the four assembly seats including the two it had snatched in the assembly elections.Since the results, the Congress is targeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while claiming that the BJP is losing its momentum. "BJP is losing its momentum, especially in Hindi heartland" due to its "anti-people policies," news agency PTI quoted Congress' general secretary KC Venugopal as saying.The terms of the legislative assemblies of Goa, Manipur, Punjab and Uttarakhand are coming to an end in March 2022, while the term of the Uttar Pradesh legislative assembly is scheduled to end in May next year. Polls are also due in Himachal Pradesh in December next year.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/honours-are-even-chidambaram-s-thought-provoking-analysis-of-bypoll-results-101635923704766.html
03-11-2021||India||Amit Shah rolls out Ayushman Bharat CAPF healthcare scheme||Union home minister Amit Shah on Tuesday rolled out the Ayushmaan Bharat CAPF healthcare scheme at a national level for the personnel of the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) in all states. It is a joint initiative by home ministry and the National Health Authority (NHA), and it aims to provide cashless and paperless medical treatment at empanelled hospitals and access to health services across the country to CAPF personnel.“On the auspicious occasion of ‘Dhanvantri Pooja’, which is celebrated in the honour of The God of Medicine, the process of distribution of health cards across CAPFs has begun,” stated the press release issued by the ministry of health. It further stated that the number of health cards issued to the CAPFs will be displayed on the website of the ministry of home daily. By the end of December, the scheme is likely to be covering all 3.5 million CAPF personnel.Shah said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given paramount importance to the security forces of the country and taken multiple steps for their welfare and that the CAPFs should take care of the country’s security without any worries, since the Modi government will take care of their families, he added.The ‘Ayushmaan CAPF’ scheme was first launched by Shah in Assam on January 23 this year. It will cover officials and serving personnel and their dependents from seven forces--Assam Rifles, Border Security Force (BSF), Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB), Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), National Security Guard (NSG), and Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) under the scheme.Also Read: In Kashmir, Amit Shah gives a glimpse of the Centre’s strategyBeneficiaries of the scheme can collect the Ayushman CAPF e-card from respective forces. This card will be activated at empanelled private hospitals using a copy of service ID and Aadhaar or any other government-approved photo ID. The e-card can also be obtained from Pradhan Mantri Aarogya Mitra (PMAM) stationed at PM-JAY empanelled private hospital using the same documents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amit-shah-rolls-out-ayushman-bharat-capf-healthcare-scheme-101635923456726.html
03-11-2021||India||India adds another supercomputer at Mohali under national mission||Under the National Supercomputing Mission, India has increased its capability by adding a 650-teraflops system at the National Agri-Food Biotechnology Institute (NABI) in Mohali. The system was inaugurated by the minister of state for science and technology Jitendra Singh on Tuesday. The facility has been established at the cost of ₹20 crores.“This will cater to the needs of inter-disciplinary cutting-edge research being carried out in the institute related to agriculture and nutritional biotechnology. It will also be available for scientists of NABI and Centre of Innovation and Applied Bioprocessing and will be open to collaborative work for the scientists and faculties working in neighbouring institutes and universities,” Singh said.He said supercomputers such as these will be a facilitator of 75 chosen start-ups – for the 75th year of Independence – in the fields of telemedicine, digital health, big data, artificial intelligence, and blockchain.So far, at least six other supercomputers have been established or are soon to be under the mission – a 797 teraflops supercomputer at Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (Pune), 833 teraflops supercomputer in IIT (Banaras Hindu University), a 1.6 petaflops supercomputer in IIT Kharagpur, a 1.3 petaflops supercomputer at IIT-Kanpur, an 838 petaflops supercomputer at Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research, and a 650 teraflops supercomputer at IIT Hyderabad.The supercomputing mission gave the country its first machine capable of petascale computing. Petascale computing refers to the ability to add at least a quadrillion (1,000 trillion) real numbers in a second. That computer speed is equivalent to 5,000-6,000 high-end laptops working in tandem.Also Read: IISER professor Rajesh Gokhale is new DBT secretary The target of the mission is to establish a network of supercomputers ranging from a few teraflops to hundreds of teraflops capability, with at least three systems greater than or equal to three petaflops in research institutes across the country. The mission plans to upgrade the country’s total capacity to 45 petaflops.With the mission, the government aims to move from importing supercomputers initially, to a greater level of integration even at the motherboard level within India in the second phase and manufacturing most of the components other than chipsets in India in the third phase.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-adds-another-supercomputer-under-national-mission-101635922198527.html
03-11-2021||India||Report warns of deepening inequalities as schools reopen||The reopening of schools cannot be considered a normal “return to schools” and lack of a comprehensive approach at this time may deepen the existing education inequality, the National Coalition on the Education Emergency, a group of academics and educationists, said in a report on Tuesday.The report titled “A Future at Stake – Guidelines and Principles to Resume and Renew Education” outlined a set of recommendations to help with the reopening of schools after over 18 months.“An overwhelming majority of India’s 250 million children who are now returning to schools had no regular contact with teachers or structured learning opportunities during the pandemic, leading to an education emergency of incalculable proportions. Yet, state governments are re-opening schools as if nothing serious occurred, students have been moved up by two grades and the normal syllabus is being followed, often after a short remedial course to bring them up to grade level,” the report said.The education ministry on Tuesday said 22 states and Union territories (UTs) have reopened schools for classes 1 to 12. Six states and UTs have reopened them from classes 9 to 12 and six for classes 6 to 12.The report said special efforts need to be made to recover language and mathematics competencies and for adopting a socio-emotional development approach. “This will allow students to make progress across multiple subjects. It means adjustment to the syllabus and timetable to give adequate time to these curricular areas,” the report said.It highlighted the loss of the most basic language and mathematics skills among children of the rural and urban poor, Dalits, Adivasis, minorities and migrant labourers, leading to millions of drop-outs.“Children have lost the habit of reading and writing. Treating our children’s return to school as business-as-usual would be an irreparable loss to children and their lives and puts India’s future at stake,” said Shantha Sinha, former head of the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights and a member of the coalition.Also Read: Delhi govt to provide free coaching to 15,000 students this year Among the recommendations made are regular coaching and mentoring of teachers, provision for additional learning materials for the reorganised curriculum, back to school enrolment drives, health and nutrition for children, regular and simple two-way communications with parents, school management committee members, teachers, members of local authorities and other primary stakeholders, and proactive management through district education emergency units and additional funds.Sajitha Bashir, another member and former global adviser for education to the World Bank, said, “Several countries across the world are modifying the curriculum and teaching methods to enable children to re-engage with education, focusing on core competencies, and providing extra resources and budgets, instructional time and effort to help the disadvantaged.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/report-warns-of-deepening-inequalities-as-schools-reopen-101635920336267.html

They have reached Kushhar village in Gopalganj and have launched an investigation into the incident, Hindustan Times' sister publication Livehindustan reported.Three other people fell ill after consuming the spurious liquor, Livehindustan further reported quoting Suprintendent of Police Anand Kumar. They are being treated in Champaran, he added.The bodies of three deceased people have been sent to Gopalganj Sadar hospital for post-mortem, which will determine the exact cause of death.This comes days after eight people died and several others fell ill in a similar incident in Muzaffarpur district. This has come as a shock to authorities where total prohibition is in place for five years.The incident took place in Rupauli village under Saraiya police station on October 28. Two persons, including a member of the local panchayat samiti, were arrested in connection with the incident, police said.From January to October this year, 70 people died and many others lost their eyesight after allegedly consuming spurious liquor in Nawada, West Champaran, Muzaffarpur, Siwan and Rohtas districts, according to government figure.Interacting with the media during his 'Janata Ke Darbaar' programme on Monday, chief minister Nitish Kumar appealed to people to cooperate with the government to curb such incidents as liquor is "bad for health and the society"."I know majority of people are in favour of the prohibition in the state. A handful of residents violate it," he said.The Nitish Kumar government had banned the manufacture, trade, storage, transportation, sale and consumption of liquor in the state on April 5, 2016. In September, the state government slightly tweaked its policy, which narrowed the area to be sealed in case of liquor haul.According to modifications in Bihar Prohibition and Excise Rules, 2021, instead of sealing the entire premises, only the portion from where recoveries are made would be sealed.The relaxation, however, would not apply in case of detection of liquor manufacturing or bulk storage from any premises or sale/purchase and supply from there. In that situation, the entire premises would be sealed as per provisions of the Bihar Prohibition and Excise Act, 2016.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-die-in-bihar-after-consuming-spurious-liquor-70-deaths-so-far-this-year-101635919871384.html

03-11-2021||India||Bihar adds about 20k seats in colleges in bid to raise enrolment ratio||Bihar government has approved addition of nearly 20,000 seats in undergraduate colleges in four universities to meet the demand and expand higher education capacity in the state, education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary said. “Chief minister Nitish Kumar has been consistently emphasising the need to increase gross enrolment ratio (GER) in higher education in the state and the decision is significant in this regard. This will ensure that the students don’t have to wander due to lack of seats in colleges,” the minister said.In higher education, the GER in Bihar continues to be low at around 15%, compared to 27.4% at the national level in 2017-18, according to the All India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE). In comparison, Tamil Nadu recorded 49% GER. The present enrolment figures also includes those studying through distance mode. Under the new education policy, the target is to take GER to 50% nationally by 2035, for which Bihar will have to make a lot of efforts.Besides, Bihar grapples with a serious shortage of teachers in its higher education institutions, which are at present functioning at around 50% of the sanctioned strength with assistance from ad hoc appointments. Though Bihar state university service commission has started the appointment process, it may take a long time to complete.“With increase in the number of seats, the sanctioned strength of teachers, which has remained unchanged for decades, will also need to be raised to maintain teacher-student ratio and the government should think in that regard. The appointed process should also be sped up, as by the time a new batch of teachers join, greater number retire,” said KB Sinha, working president of the federation of university teachers association of Bihar (FUTAB).Maximum 10,200 seats have been added to the 41 colleges under Lalit Narayan Mithila University, spread across Darbhanga, Madhubani and Samastipur, followed by 4,736 seats in 19 colleges of JP University (Chapra) and 3,388 seats in 11 colleges of TM Bhagalpur University.Also Read: Electricity in Bihar may get cheaper as tariffs likely to be revisedIn the four colleges of Patna University, 505 seats have been increased including 180 seats in Patna College, 260 seats in Patna Women’s college and 60 seats in Patna Science College. College of Art and Craft in Patna has also got 15 additional seats.In 2010-11, the government had decided to increase the number of seats in colleges following the plan to de-link intermediate from colleges in a phased manner, in keeping with the national policy. However, except Patna University in 2007, none of the universities could delink intermediate from colleges and later the government developed cold feet.At present, the number of students passing the higher secondary examination to qualify for admission in degree colleges has increased manifold since 2005-06. In 2021, around 13.65 lakh students registered for the plus two board exams from the state board. The number is likely to further go up, requiring more seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-adds-about-20k-seats-in-colleges-in-bid-to-raise-enrolment-ratio-101635918116220.html

03-11-2021||India||Explained: PM Narendra Modi’s commitments at COP26 summit on climate change||In one of the most ambitious targets by a developing country to combat climate change, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday announced that India will achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2070. The announcement, made at the UN-led COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow, will push the developed world to enhance climate finance for the 2021-2030 period.The Indian PM also made it clear that rich countries will have to provide $ 1 trillion in climate finance to the developing world to achieve its climate change mitigation targets, while speaking out in support of vulnerable island nations that are in the danger of submerging because of rising sea levels. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO), a UN body, had said that the global sea level rose by a factor of two - that is, 4.3mm per year - between 2013 and 2021, and the rate of rise is expected to jump further in the coming decade due to rising carbon emissions.India’s five-point climate action plan, which PM Narendra Modi described as “panchamrit (five values)”, is set to give a firm push to India’s plans for increasing renewable energy, and switching to electricity and hydrogen fuels for transport. Also Read: Biden feels not attending COP26 may have cost China influence on world stageIndia is No. 4 in the world when it comes to installed renewable energy capacity, and its non-fossil fuel energy has increased by more than 25% in the last seven years, reaching 40 % of country’s energy mix this year.However, India will continue to grow on fossil fuels for another 20 years, and only after that, its emissions will start to fall, show various studies done on the country’s energy basket. All this will also depend a lot on technology transfer from the western world and the installation of new green energy hubs in India.Here’s an explainer on what India committed at the COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow.Net zero by 2070A paper done by Montek Singh Ahluwalia, then vice-chairperson of the now dissolved Planning Commission, which was released in October 2021, says India’s emissions can peak around 2035 and then move towards net zero sometime between 2065 and 2070. But another paper, done by the Council for Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), says India will have to peak by 2040 to achieve its target of reaching net zero by 2070. For this to happen, the CEEW said coal-based power generation must peak by 2040 and then come down. The CEEW also said solar electricity generation will have to go up to 5,630GW by 2070, while the wind energy will be second biggest contributor by providing 1,792GW by 2070. To achieve net zero, the share of electric cars and the contribution of biofuels for heavier vehicles will have to reach 84% by 2070, the CEEW said, adding that the majority section of industry will have to shift to cleaner biofuels or hydrogen.As of 2019, India installed a capacity to generate about 134GW of clean energy from solar, wind and nuclear sources, the Centre for Science and Environment said. India, as of today, has about 210GW of coal-based capacity – with 39GW under construction and another 25GW in various stages of approval. “Reducing the life [span] of [such] plants to 25 years can help in achieving net zero,” Montek Singh Ahluwalia said. There is unanimity among energy experts that India’s dependence on coal will have to be cut drastically in the next 10-15 years to achieve its net zero target, and the country will have to swiftly switch to cleaner fuels.Ahluwalia also warned that phasing out coal will have financial implications for poor states such as Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Jharkhand, Bengal, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. In Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, for example, close to 15% of the state revenue comes directly and indirectly from the mining sector. In addition, these states will lose out on employment as new employment opportunities in the renewable energy sector will be created in western and southern India, which have better solar and wind resources.With India aiming to cover one-third of its geographical area with trees and forest cover, the country’s carbon reducing capacity will go up considerably. Forests can absorb up to 20 % of carbon emissions, according to an environment ministry study conducted in 2011 when India’s green cover was about 24% of the its geographical area. With the green cover increasing, the country’s carbon sequestration ability will also improve.Also Read: Xi Jinping sends written statement to COP26, China alleges video link not givenNet zero basically refers to the balance between the quantity of greenhouse gases emitted and the quantity removed from the air. A country is said to have reached net zero when the quantity of greenhouse gases it adds to the atmosphere is equal to the quantity it manages to remove from the air - cancelling each other out.Net zero was the most hotly debated subject at the COP26 talks in Glasgow as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) had said achieving net zero by 2050 is a must to limit an overall global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius to pre-industrial levels by the end of 2100. India is the fourth largest emitter of greenhouse gases after China, the US and the European Union bloc, and according to the IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report released on August 9, it will be among the most severely affected countries.500GW of non-fossil fuels by 2030This target is easier said than done even though India has prepared a road map for having installed capacity to generate 450GW by 2030. In an analysis for the 500GW target, the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) said India’s Central Electricity Authority (CEA) has done a projection for the country’s energy mix for 2030 that shows it will need to have solar energy installed capacity of 280GW and wind energy installed capacity of 140GW. The rest of the energy needs will come from nuclear. This would mean India will produce half of its energy requirements from renewables, which PM Narendra Modi promised at the COP26 summit. According to the CEA, India’s total installed electricity capacity will be 1,100GW by 2030. The CSE said that target is achievable if India stops investing in coal. Cutting carbon emissions by 1 billion tonnesModi announced in Glasgow that India will reduce projected carbon emissions by 1 billion tonnes (Gt) between 2021 and 2030 - but that does not mean India will cut emissions. It basically means 1 billion tonnes of lesser emissions from the business-as-usual scenario. According to the business-as-usual scenario, India’s projected carbon emissions by 2030 will be 4.48 billion tonnes, almost double its present emissions, according to the CSE. This would mean a 22% reduction in carbon emissions.India’s projected emissions in 2030 would be 3.48 billion tonnes, just 9% of the remaining carbon budget of 400 billion tonnes. Of the total global emissions, India’s share will be a relatively small 8.4%, while China and the US will continue to be two biggest carbon emitters, the CSE said.In per capita terms, it would mean India will have emitted 2.98 tonnes of CO2 in a business-as-usual scenario, and going by this target, it will be 2.31 tonnes per capita, less than that of any industrialised country in the world including China. As of today, India’s per capita emissions is 1.98 tonnes of CO2. If you compare this to the world, the US per capita emissions will be 9.42 tonnes in 2030, EU 4.12 tonnes in 2030, India’s will be 2.7 tonnes in 2030 and China’s will be 8.88 tonnes per capita. According to the IPCC, global CO2 emissions must be 18.22 Gt in 2030 for the world to limit the rise in the overall temperature to under 1.5°C.Reducing carbon intensity by 45%Carbon intensity measures emissions of CO2 for per unit of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). So, reducing carbon intensity means India will emit less carbon for its economic growth and its adaptation of cleaner technologies in various sectors of the economy. According to the CSE, India has achieved 25% of emission intensity reduction of its GDP between 2005 and 2016, and is on course to achieve more than 40% by 2030. Achieving 45% won’t be difficult considering India would be meeting half of its energy demand from cleaner technologies by 2030, and there is a broad hydrogen road map for the country to adopt over the next 10 years.India has taken measures to reduce emissions from the transport sector, and the energy intensive industrial sector - especially cement, iron and steel, non-metallic minerals and chemical, which contribute about 30% of the total emissions. In the coming years, India will have to make the measures stringent and force industries to comply with them, Ahluwalia said in his paper. The CEEW said that India will have to reinvent its mobility systems to move people and goods in a more efficient manner. “India can significantly reduce its carbon intensity by giving incentives to adopt hydrogen as fuel for new industries and for non-peak hours,” said Chandra Bhushan, CEO of I-Forest.Climate financeThe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) defines climate finance as money from government, private and alternate sources of financing. Climate finance is needed for mitigation because large-scale investments are required to significantly reduce emissions. It is also needed for the adaptation process, as significant financial resources are needed to adapt to adverse effects and reduce the impact of changing climate, according to the UNFCCC.Modi categorically said the developing world expects developed countries to provide climate finance of $1 trillion at the earliest to meet net zero targets and adopt a cleaner growth trajectory. Till end of 2020, the rich countries were able to provide $80 billion dollars of climate finance. In 2009, developed countries pledged to raise $100 billion a year by 2020 to help developing countries deal with the impact of climate change. The finance ministers of rich countries at a G20 meeting pushed back the year to 2023 in a bid to end a possible deadlock at the Glasgow summit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/explained-pm-narendra-modi-s-commitments-at-cop26-summit-on-climate-change-101635914035710.html

03-11-2021||India||Above normal rain in Peninsular India likely in November||Rainfall in November is likely to be above normal (>122% of LPA) in South Peninsular India, according to India Meteorological Department (IMD). The LPA (Long Period Average of rainfall over 50 years) in the region in November from 1961 to 2010 has been about 117.46 mm.The spatial distribution forecast suggests normal to above normal rainfall in most parts of South Peninsular India. Below normal to normal rainfall is likely in parts of north, northwest, and central India. Normal to above-normal rainfall is most likely in the remaining parts of the country, IMD said on Tuesday.Presently, La Niña conditions are prevailing over the equatorial Pacific Ocean and neutral Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) conditions over the Indian Ocean. The latest global model forecasts indicate the La Niña conditions are likely to continue until March 2022 and neutral IOD conditions during the upcoming seasons, IMD said. Normally, during La Nina conditions, rainfall is normal or below normal during the northeast monsoon in southern Peninsular India. But this time rainfall is expected to be above normal because of the favourable location of Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO). “MJO is near Africa now. It will move towards the Indian Ocean. With this the cyclonic potential will be more in the Indian Ocean region and easterly waves will strengthen. Therefore, we are expecting above-normal rain over South Peninsula,” said DS Pai, who heads climate research and services at IMD, Pune.Due to the impact of La Nina, minimum and maximum temperatures are likely to be considerably below normal (by 1 to 2 degrees) in most parts of the country including northwest India. “Our extended range forecast indicates below normal temperatures over most parts of the country,” Pai said.La Niña refers to the large-scale cooling of the ocean surface temperatures in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean, coupled with changes in the tropical atmospheric circulation--winds, pressure and rainfall. It usually has the opposite impacts on weather and climate as El Niño, which is the warm phase of the so-called El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO).Also Read: Delhi’s AQI to hover around 300 for the next few days, says IMDENSO has a major influence on weather and climate patterns such as heavy rains, floods, and drought. In India, El Nino is associated with drought or weak monsoon. La Nina is associated with strong monsoon and above-average rains and colder winters.The MJO is an eastward moving disturbance of clouds, rainfall, winds, and pressure that traverses the planet in the tropics and returns to its initial starting point in 30 to 60 days on average, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Its location and amplitude strongly modulate the intensity of tropical convection and features like low-pressure systems over the north Indian Ocean.The changes in the Sea Surface Temperature conditions over the Pacific and the Indian Oceans are known to influence the Indian climate. IMD is carefully monitoring the evolution of sea surface conditions over these Ocean basins, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/above-normal-rain-in-peninsular-india-likely-in-november-101635909114546.html

These teams will provide technical guidance, including public health measures, to health authorities in states.The decision was taken after Haryana, Punjab, Kerala, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Delhi and Jammu and Kashmir reported a considerable number of dengue cases.“A total of 15 states/UTs are reporting their maximum cases in the current year; these states contribute 86% of the country’s total dengue cases till October 31,” the Centre said in a release on Wednesday.Expert teams include officials from the National Centre for Disease Control and National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme."It has been decided by the competent authority to depute central teams to the identified states to assist the state governments by providing technical guidance, including public health measures, for managing the ongoing outbreak of dengue," an office memorandum sent to principal secretaries (Health) and directors general of health services of the nine states and UTs.Over 1,530 cases of dengue have been reported in Delhi this year so far, of which nearly 1,200 were recorded in October alone, the highest count for the month in the last four years.In Maharashtra's Pune, the municipal corporation reported 168 cases of the vector-borne disease in the month of October. Though it's less than the 192 dengue cases the city recorded in September, the drop is marginal.The disease has already claimed 33 lives in Chandigarh. In fact, the number of dengue cases reported in October this year is even higher than the annual caseload in the previous three years across the tricity.The emergency wards in hospitals are overflowing with patients suffering from fever.The number of dengue cases is already close to 1,000 in Uttar Pradesh's Ghaziabad. Nearly 68 per cent of these cases have come in the month of October, according to health department.Dengue viruses are spread to people through the bites of infected Aedes species mosquitoes. Once contracted, the infection leads to fever, body ache, nausea, vomiting, and in severe cases, internal bleeding or a fatal drop in blood pressure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dengue-outbreak-centre-sends-central-teams-to-9-states-union-territories-101635905113977.html
03-11-2021||India||India’s demands for a new finance goal wins support||Several developing countries backed India’s demands at the COP26 climate summit for a new finance goal to support the energy transition they will require to cut greenhouse gas emissions, a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged developing countries to not let the promise of financial assistance remain hollow.This new goal will be for the period after 2025, by when developed countries may have delivered on their promised $100 billion funding that was supposed to begin in 2020 but hasn’t till now. Economists said climate finance has always been an important issue in negotiations but at Glasgow, there could be major backlash from developing countries on unfulfilled finance promises.India, in its updated nationally determined contribution, may make some of its contributions conditional to climate finance. “That is still being discussed,” a senior official from the Indian delegation said.Union environment minister, Bhupender Yadav, who is heading the Indian delegation, said at a meeting of the Like Minded Developing Countries that climate finance cannot continue at levels decided in 2009, which is $100 billion. It should be at least $1 trillion, he said -- a view that was supported by others.Guinea, on behalf of G77 and China, raised the importance of climate finance for the success of the COP26 talks and for the effective implementation of NDCs.Bolivia, which represented the LMDCs, said the developed countries’ pledge made in 2009 to mobilise $100 billion per year by 2020 has not come through and the timeline has now been shifted to 2025. Developing countries, meanwhile, are being pushed to raise their ambition on climate actions, it added further.The Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) highlighted that $1.6 trillion went to subsidising fossil fuels globally since the adoption of the Paris Agreement and asked for a decision at COP26 to call for phasing out all fossil fuels subsidies in major economies by 2023.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-demands-for-a-new-finance-goal-wins-support-101635902597479.html

According to reports, a number of chief ministers are also expected to attend the meeting, which is scheduled to take place at 12 noon.As per the release by the Prime Minister's Office (PMO), the meeting's primary focus would be districts where less than 50% of the adult population has received at least one shot of the vaccine and those that have low coverage of the second dose. According to the statement, these districts are of states including Jharkhand, Manipur, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Maharashtra, Meghalaya, and others.As per government data from October 27, with 16.1%, Nagaland’s Kiphire has the lowest coverage of at least one dose of the vaccine. This is followed by Bihar's Araria with a slightly better number (49.6%). North West district in Delhi (48.2%), Aurangabad (46.5%), Nanded (48.4%), Akola (49.3%), Deoghar (44.2%) and West Singhbhum (47.8%) are some of the prominent districts among the identified 48 districts that have to catch up to the national average, according to government data.Meanwhile, India's overall vaccination coverage exceeded 1.07 billion (107,25,41,626) on Tuesday, the Union ministry of health and family welfare said on Tuesday.

03-11-2021||India||Strong CMs behind bypoll wins: BJP||The Bharatiya Janata Party on Tuesday described the outcome of the bypolls held in 29 assembly constituencies across 13 states and in three Lok Sabha constituencies as an endorsement of the incumbent governments barring the exception of Himachal Pradesh where the party lost all three assembly seats it contested and did not win the single Lok Sabha seat as well. Senior party leaders also emphasised that the outcome is not a reflection on the performance of the BJP at the Centre.While it managed to win all five seats in Assam, the party’s performance in Himachal Pradesh, which goes to polls in 2022, and where the BJP is in power, Rajasthan where it emerged third and fourth in the two assembly seats where bypolls were held, and in Karnataka, where it lost a seat in Karnataka CM Basavaraj Bommai’s hometurf has sounded an alarm.A senior party leader said the outcome in Himachal is a consequence of the Jairam Thakur government having failed to counter grievances. “There is a perception that the government was not seen to be addressing the issues of price rise, which has clearly gone in the favour of the Congress party. The other issue was the decision of not giving tickets to kin of party leaders,” added this person, a senior leader based in Delhi. Thakur attributed the loss to inflation, but it is clear that he may have to take the blame for the loss.
03-11-2021||India||Key victories for Congress but challenges remain||For the Congress—a party currently jockeying with several other parties for the leadership in the Opposition space—the results of the latest round of by-elections are a mixed bag.Sure, it won all three assembly seats and a Lok Sabha seat in Himachal Pradesh, won two assembly seats in Rajasthan, and one each in Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, but with Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress tightening its grip over West Bengal by sweeping all four assembly seats at stake, including two that earlier belonged to the Bharatiya Janata Party, its advantage may be minor, analysts say.The TMC is already testing waters in Goa.Former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi tweeted, “Every victory for the Congress is a victory of our party worker. Keep fighting hate. No fear!”The victories are important for the principal Opposition party ahead of assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Punjab early next year. Congress leaders quickly underlined that the party did well against the BJP where the two were in direct contest, but downplayed the dominance of the BJP and its allies in the North East (where they won all 10 assembly seats at stake) and the BJP’s win in two out of three assembly seats in Madhya Pradesh.“BJP has lost 2 out of 3 seats in the Lok Sabha by-elections. Even in the assembly elections where there is a direct contest between the Congress and the BJP, the BJP has lost. Himachal, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Maharashtra are proof of this. Mr. Modi, Leave the kingdom! Take back the black laws. Stop looting of petrol-diesel-gas,” tweeted Randeep Surjewala.Of the three Lok Sabha seats that went to the polls, the Congress wrested one from the BJP, while the Shiv Sena, a Congress ally in Maharashtra won another. The BJP won the third.For the Congress, winning seats in states where it is in a direct fight with the BJP is important, analysts said. Congress insiders maintain that if the party can perform well in these direct contests, it can stabilize its leadership position in Opposition bloc and also challenge the BJP more meaningfully.Still, Trinamool’s success in Bengal helps chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s cause in national politics theatre, said a senior TMC leader. The party’s national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee wasted no time in tweeting, “A cracker free Diwali in true sense. Wishing folks at BJP a very Happy Diwali!”A senior Congress leader said on the condition of anonymity, “The big victory for the Congress ahead of the polls is significant. It will also help us set our tone for the upcoming polls. But the challenge of dealing with a more powerful Trinamool also becomes more important.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/key-victories-for-congress-but-challenges-remain-101635899158444.html

The committee had on October 26 sought additional clarifications from Covaxin manufacturer Bharat Biotech.The technical advisory group for EUL is an independent advisory group that provides recommendations to WHO on whether a Covid-19 vaccine can be listed for emergency use.Bharat Biotech has been stuck in a regulatory loop, with independent technical experts of the UN health body taking longer to analyse the data that previously disclosed timelines.So far, the WHO has approved six vaccines - Pfizer/BioNTech's Comirnaty, AstraZeneca's Covishield, Johnson & Johnson's vaccine, Moderna's mRNA-1273, Sinopharm's BBIBP-CorV and Sinovac's CoronaVac.Yet, there are many countries which have given approval to Covaxin to ease international travel and allow passengers to enter their geographies. These are:• Guyana• Iran• Mauritius• Mexico• Nepal• Paraguay• Philippines• Zimbabwe• Australia• Oman• Sri Lanka• Estonia• GreeceEarlier, a WHO decision on Covaxin EUL was expected on October 5, after the global health body sought additional information on September 27.Experts said it may just be a matter of time before a EUL is granted to Covaxin.The travellers, who have been administered Covaxin and intend to go to the United States or the United Kingdom, will have to wait for the WHO nod, or approval from the European Union (EU). These countries haven't also individually approved Covaxin yet.Covaxin has demonstrated 77.8 per cent effectiveness against symptomatic Covid-19 and 65.2 per cent protection against the new Delta variant. The Bharat Biotech said that it concluded the final analysis of Covaxin efficacy from Phase 3 trials.Meanwhile, India's cumulative vaccination coverage crossed 1.07 billion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-covaxin-awaits-who-approval-here-s-list-of-countries-where-it-is-cleared-101635897929788.html
03-11-2021||India||Mapping a clean October, and what could lie ahead...||Indians, especially in the northern plains, have so far been spared the toxic air they usually breathe with the end of the monsoon. The windfall of a delayed pollution season is not the result of proactive steps to control pollution. It was mostly delayed rainfall and farm fires, the latter also a result of delayed paddy procurement. None of these factors means that this year will not see a spike in pollution levels. In fact, there is enough data to show that pollution levels and factors which contribute to it are already seeing a spike.October 2021 air was better than October 2020 in most statesIn terms of concentration of PM 2.5, October 2021 was a better air-quality month than October 2020 in most Indian states. This is especially the case for northern India. If one were to look air quality in Delhi, Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, the region most infamous for farm-fire driven spike in pollution levels, October was at least 25% cleaner than what it was last year. To be sure, some states in the eastern and southern region did see a rise in pollution levels. However, it needs to be kept in mind that air-quality in southern and eastern states is generally much better than what it is in the northern plains. For example, Odisha saw the highest increase in PM 2.5 concentration between October 2021 and October 2020. However, its average PM 2.5 level in October 2021 was 37 microgram per cubic metre, much lower than Delhi, where PM 2.5 levels declined by 43% between October 2021 and October 2020, but were still at an average of 72 microgram per cubic metre.Rainfall and temperature responsible for clean air in OctoberEven if emission of pollutants doesn’t decrease, the weather can improve air quality. This may be because of rainfall, which washes away pollutants; or a higher temperature or windy conditions, which prevent accumulation of pollutants close to the ground. A combination of these factors helped in improvement of air quality this October in the northern states. Of the six states where air quality has worsened, in four – Assam, Maharashtra, Odisha, and Telangana – October 2021 rainfall is 29% to 65% less than October 2020. In West Bengal and Kerala, where rainfall was more and farm fires aren’t a big issue, maximum temperatures have decreased, and perhaps aided the worsening of air quality.But pollution levels have been rising since the last week of OctoberAs the factors which led to pollution levels being lower than last year dissipate – rains have stopped, temperatures have started falling and farm fires have increased – air quality is already deteriorating in the northern plains. Air quality in last week of October 2021 was closer to the more polluted October 2020 levels than in the first three weeks of last month. With a rise in farm fires, this is only expected to get worseFor most of October, fires in Punjab and Haryana, as observed by satellites, were lower than the number observed at this time of the year in the past. The sum of such fires in the two states from October 1 to October 30 was 14,822. This is the lowest number of fires since 2012, the earliest year for which the data is available from the Suomi-NPP satellite. The only year in the last 10 years with when the number of fires was not in the 20,000-30,000 range is 2018, when 18,512 fires were observed in the first 30 days of October. This situation changed dramatically on October 31. There were 3,140 such fires on the day, still only 7th highest in the last 10 years but comparable to the number of fires observed every year on the day.Pollution data is not as representative as rainfall or temperature dataHT has been using the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) gridded databases to analyse rainfall and temperature patterns in India. When it comes to pollution, the analysis unfortunately cannot be as comprehensive as temperature and rainfall. This is because availability of pollution data is contingent on functioning monitoring stations over a longer term. Unfortunately, there are still very few of them in India.There are currently 312 stations spread over 156 cities. Just 19 cities account for half of these stations and three alone -- Delhi (40 stations), Mumbai (21 stations), and Bengaluru (10 stations) -- account for nearly a quarter of these stations. Not all of these stations have worked consistently. This is a big problem in looking at long-term pollution levels. The analysis given here has used data from just 185 stations across 109 cities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mapping-a-clean-air-october-in-delhi-and-what-could-lie-ahead-101635895525036.html
03-11-2021||India||DSP prisons, school principal in Jammu and Kashmir sacked for ‘terror links’||Jammu and Kashmir government has terminated the services of two more senior officers -- a deputy superintendent in J&K prisons department and the principal of Government Girls Higher Secondary School --- for their alleged links with terrorist organisations.In the past one year, the government has sacked more than a dozen employees and officers for their links with militancy.Feroz Ahmad Lone, deputy superintendent of jails, J&K prison department, and Javid Ahmad Shah, principal, Government Girls Higher Secondary School, Bijbehara, have been terminated from services on the orders of J&K Lt Governor, Manoj Sinha.Sources in the government said that after a high-level meeting, the government decided to sack both employees for their links with militant groups. The termination orders have been issued by the government in terms of Article 311.“The Lieutenant Governor is satisfied after considering the facts and circumstances of the case and on the basis of the information available that the activities of Mr Feroz Ahmad Lone, deputy superintendent jail S/o Abdul Gaffar Lone R/o Futlipora, Chari Sharef, are such as to warrant his dismissal from service,” the order said.“The Lieutenant Governor is satisfied under sub-clause (c) of the proviso to clause (2) of Article 311 of the Constitution of India that in the interest of the security of the state, it is not expedient to hold an enquiry in the case of Mr. Feroz Ahmad Lone, Deputy Superintendent Jail S/o Abdul Gaffar Lone R/o Futlipora , Chrari Sharief , Budgam,” the order added.Similar termination orders were issued in the name of Javid Ahmad Shah of Eidgah Bijbehara Anantnag by the Lt Governor Manoj Sinha.Sources said that Lone, who was appointed in government service in 2012, had links with former Hizbul Mujahideen operational chief, Riyaz Naikoo, who was killed in an operation in Pulwama last year. Sources said he had hatched criminal conspiracy with militant commanders to send youths illegally into Pakistan/PoK, for weapons’ training and later to get them back into Kashmir for the acts of terrorism.Javid Ahmad Shah was appointed as lecturer in 1989 and had rose to become the principal Bijbehara school. Sources said he was sympathiser of Hurriyat and Jamat-e-Islami (JeI).Last month, J&K government had terminated the services of the grandson of separatist leader, Syed Ali Geelani. Anees ul Islam was working as a research officer in Sher-e-Kashmir International Convention Centre (SKICC).More than a dozen government employees have been already terminated for anti-national activities on the instructions of Lt Governor Manoj Sinha in J&K. Among them were the two sons of Hizbul Mujahideen chief Syed Salahudin. They were sacked along with 11 government employees in July.The LG had set up a special task force for this purpose in April this year, to scrutinise and recommend cases under Article 311(2)(c) of the Constitution of India and recommended removal of officials from government service over militants links.The earlier dismissal of employees had attracted sharp reaction from mainstream political parties and employees unions, who said the employees have been terminated on flimsy grounds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dsp-prisons-school-principal-in-jammu-and-kashmir-sacked-for-terror-links-101635885952036.html

This will inculcate good values and thoughts of Mahatma Gandhi among school students”, said chief minister Bhupesh Baghel. Baghel said the aim to also to pay tribute to the eminent personality.“The spirit of social unity and harmony will be strengthened among the children of the state through the thoughts of Mahatma Gandhi,” said Baghel. Baghel also stressed the need to imbibe the basic spirit of Gandhiji’s favourite hymns and adopt them in everyday life.“The relevance of Gandhiji’s favourite hymns has increased in the changing socio-political environment all over the world. National unity and social harmony are the basic nature of India and to make politics a medium of service, it is the duty of all of us to feel the pain of the needy, victims, and the underprivileged and ensure helping them in every possible way”, Baghel said. In September, the Chhattisgarh government decided to develop an ashram in Nava Raipur along the lines of Mahatma Gandhi’s Sevagram ashram in Wardha to promote the ideals of Mahatama Gandhi. The government claimed that rural art, craft, folk music and other artisans will be promoted and experts will also visit the ashram to provide guidance. The government is also planning to open an old-age home and a school for underprivileged kids.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/raghupati-raghav-vaishnav-jan-to-be-sung-in-schools-chhattisgarh-government-101635881989005.html
03-11-2021||India||Bypolls an endorsement of incumbent governments : BJP||NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party on Tuesday described the outcome of the by polls held in 29 assembly constituencies across 13 states and in three Lok Sabha constituencies as an endorsement of the incumbent governments barring the exception of Himachal Pradesh where the party lost all three assembly seats it contested and did not win the single Lok Sabha seat as well. Senior party leaders also emphasized that the outcome is not a reflection on the performance of the BJP at the centre. While it managed to win all five seats in Assam, the party’s performance in Himachal Pradesh, which goes to polls in 2022, and where the BJP is in power, Rajasthan where it emerged third and fourth in the two assembly constituencies where bypolls were held, and in Karnataka, where it lost a seat in Karnataka CM Basavaraj Bommai’s hometurf of Hanagal has sounded an alarm. A senior party leader said the outcome in Himachal Pradesh is a consequence of the Jairam Thakur government having failed to counter grievances against price rise, control infighting in the state unit, and erring in ticket distribution.“There is a perception that the government was not seen to be addressing the issues of price rise, which has clearly gone in the favour of the Congress party. The other issue was the decision of not giving tickets to kin of party leaders. While the intent was to create a level playing field, in Jubbal-Kotkhai for instance, the BJP candidate ended up in the third place with a mere 4% vote,” added this person, a senior leader based in Delhi. Thakur attributed the loss to inflation, but it is clear that he may have to take the blame for the loss. A second leader of the BJP said the election results have reiterated the need for strong local leadership. “States where the chief ministers are strong, the by-poll results have gone in their favour. Take the case of Assam and Madhya Pradesh. In MP amid reports of severe anti-incumbency CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan campaigned aggressively and took measures to mitigate public anger; his election campaign was centered around communities especially the marginalised tribes and castes.” Winning Prithvipur and Jobat, both seats held by the Congress has come as a shot in the arm for Chouhan and taken the focus off the loss the party faced in Raigaon which was held by the BJP. The BJP also won the Khandwa Lok Sabha by poll. BJP leader and in-charge of MP, Muralidhar Rao, said the party’s victory was in response to the successful pro people policies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and CM Chouhan. “The people’s welfare policies have won the seal of public approval.” The party’s loss in Rajasthan has been exacerbated by the wide margins of loss and the shrinking vote share. “There is need to rejig the party apparatus in the state. The local unit is fraught with infighting. Despite the central leadership’s intervention, the unit has not been able to put asides its differences and fight as a cohesive unit,” said the first functionary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bypolls-an-endorsement-of-incumbent-governments-bjp-101635880969453.html
03-11-2021||India||YSRCP retains Badvel seat, big loss for BJP, Congress||The ruling YSR Congress party in Andhra Pradesh has retained the Badvel assembly seat in the October 30 by-election with a record majority of more than 90,000 votes over near rival Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the result of which was announced on Tuesday.YSRCP candidate Dr Dasari Sudha, a practising doctor, was declared elected with a huge margin of 90,411 votes over Panathala Suresh of the BJP. While Sudha secured 112,072 votes, the BJP candidate polled only 21,661 votes. Congress candidate, former MLA P M Kamalamma, finished a poor third with 6,217 votes. Both the BJP and the Congress lost their deposits.The by-election was necessitated due to the death of Sudha’s husband and sitting MLA Dr Gunthoti Venkata Subbaiah in March this year.“I am overwhelmed by the affection shown by the people of Badvel, who blessed me with double the majority my husband had got in the 2019 assembly elections. It reflects the people’s endorsement to the governance of our chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy,” Sudha told reporters after being declared elected by the returning officer.In the 2019 assembly elections, Sudha’s husband Subbaiah secured a majority of around 45,000 votes over then Telugu Desam Party (TDP) candidate Obulapuram Rajasekhar.The YSRCP victory was a foregone conclusion as the party has been representing the constituency for the last two terms. Moreover, Kadapa district has been the bastion of Jagan’s family since the days of his father, late Dr Y S Rajasekhar Reddy, former Congress chief minister.When YSR was alive, Congress dominated Kadapa, and after the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh, the Congress lost its hold as the party cadre shifted loyalties to the YSRCP. In the last general elections, the YSRCP won all the 10 assembly seats and two Lok Sabha seats in Kadapa.This time, the TDP opted out of the contest on the grounds of upholding the tradition of not fielding a candidate against the spouse of the deceased MLA in any by-election. So did Jana Sena Party led by popular Tollywood actor Pawan Kalyan.The BJP and the Congress contested the Badvel by-elections, even though they lacked the strength to take on the YSRCP.However, the BJP campaigned extensively only to test its strength. Several BJP leaders, including state party president Somu Veerraju, BJP national general secretary Daggubati Purandeshwari, BJP national in-charge of AP Sunil Deodhar, MPs C M Ramesh and G V L Narasimha Rao and BJP state secretary Satya Kumar campaigned for the BJP candidate.Congress candidate Kamalamma said the polling in Badvel did not take place in a free and fair manner. “The YSRC leaders intimidated the rivals, rigged the elections by bringing voters from neighbouring areas and influenced voters with its money and muscle power,” she alleged.The BJP leaders could not be reached for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ysrcp-retains-badvel-seat-big-loss-for-bjp-congress-101635880790739.html
03-11-2021||India||Tamil Nadu plans to apply for payment bank licence, says PTR||The Tamil Nadu government is planning to seek a payment bank license to help monitor the disbursal of funds from the government treasury efficiently until it reaches the right beneficiary of various welfare schemes. This is part of the several measures being undertaken by the state finance department so that funds meant for social welfare schemes do not lay idle, aren’t delayed and so that the money earmarked for the same isn’t shifted and parked elsewhere. “The payment banking license system is a minor step, not a complicated step,” said state finance minister P T R Palanivel Thiaga Rajan on Monday while interacting with reporters. “We have already integrated with three or four banks. It will increase data transparency and cut middlemen, and of course, it will expand the reach because many people don’t have accounts in just these four banks.” He added that they state could also use interfaces like UPI, Google Pay to disburse money to the beneficiaries. He said that the process would take a few months, roughly 18 months after the state submits necessary papers. “We have to build the infrastructure first and meet the standards of the Reserve Bank of India.” The finance minister said that a special task force constituted by Tamil Nadu’s ruling DMK tracked funds to the tune of ₹1,946.31 crores unutilised by various district administrations and departments, which can be immediately remitted back to the government treasury. This comes after the minister, in his maiden budget presented in August, had announced the formation of such a task group under the finance department to reconcile the accounts and identify funds that have lapsed and can still be utilised. He had then raised the issue of government funds being shifted to accounts outside the view of the treasury system which they have now tracked. The details of bank accounts where government money was parked as of March 31 this year were collected from multiple sources like banks, district collectors, government departments and other quasi-governmental entities. “The ₹2,000 crore that can be remitted back to the treasury is just a trailer…I don’t want to commit any amount but I am sure several thousand crore rupees will be remitted back to the government account in the next few months as the task force continues to analyse,” he said, addressing a press conference in the state secretariat. The task force’s tenure has been extended till March 31, 2022, to continue with auditing. To ensure that these funds do not remain idle in the future, Rajan said that the state government was putting in place a state-level public financial management system (PFMS) in association with agency banks to track the flow of funds allocated under government schemes from the state exchequer till they reach beneficiaries including pensioners, government servants receiving salaries, recipients of scholarships and final payments for works and supply of goods and services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-plans-to-apply-for-payment-bank-licence-says-ptr-101635880789591.html
03-11-2021||India||AIADMK plans protest over Mullaperiyar dam water storage on Nov 9||The All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) on Tuesday announced that they would hold a protest in five districts of Tamil Nadu on November 9 to condemn DMK’s ruling over the store and release of water in the Mullaperiyar dam.The party accused the ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) of succumbing to Kerala’s compulsions and failing to store water up to the permitted 142 feet level in the dam. A joint statement released by AIADMK leaders, O Panneerselvam and Edappadi Palaniswami said late chief minister J Jayalalithaa’s efforts led the Supreme Court to pass a judgment allowing water to be stored up to a level of 142 feet in the dam in 2017, and after maintenance and strengthening work, water could be stored up to 152 feet. The AIADMK said that the DMK released water when it was only at the level of 138 feet. “The dam is under the control of Tamil Nadu. We would like to remind seasoned politician-minister (for water resources) S Duraimurugan that raising shutters in the presence of Kerala ministers as witnessed amounts to questioning the rights of Tamil Nadu,” AIADMK’s statement read. “The DMK’s indifference to the (apex court) order is condemnable.” The party would stage protests in the headquarters of Madurai, Theni, Dindigul, Sivaganga and Ramanathapuram. Stating that the Mullaperiyar dam is crucial to the economy, irrigation needs and livelihood of farmers in these districts, the AIADMK said that the DMK was being inconsiderate to these people. Irrigation and drinking water needs of tail-end districts of Sivaganga and Ramanathapuram could be met only if water is stored up to 152 feet, they added. Last Friday, the Tamil Nadu water resources department said that two spillway gates of the Mullaperiyar dam were opened to release 500 cusecs of water as rains continue to pound the catchment areas. This is being done strictly as per the rule curve approved by the central water commission, the department’s statement said, adding that Tamil Nadu is drawing water through the tunnel to Vaigai dam continuously to maintain the water level (AT?). Last Wednesday, Stalin said that the state is drawing the maximum quantity of water in the Mullaperiyar dam as requested by Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan. Stalin was responding to Vijayan’s letter received on October 24 where he urged for a gradual release of water from the dam through the tunnel to Tamil Nadu fearing that the water would accumulate in the dam as rains intensified in Kerala. Earlier in June, Duraimurugan had said that the Tamil Nadu government has requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to instruct the ministry of Environment, forest, and climate change to advise Kerala not to delay in giving the required clearances to carry out the works and to restore the water level in the Mullaperiyar dam to full reservoir level (FRL) of 152 ft.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiadmk-plans-protest-over-mullaperiyar-dam-water-storage-on-nov-9-101635880728439.html
03-11-2021||India||JD(U) retains 2 seats in Bihar; Congress sweeps Rajasthan||The Janata Dal United retained both the Kusheshwar Sthan and Tarapur assembly seats in Bihar in the bypoll results on Tuesday in an election marked by the return of RJD Chief Lalu Prasad Yadav to Bihar after a four year hiatus, and a break in the RJD-Congress relationship. At Kusheshwar Sthan, JDU candidate Aman Bhushan Hazari beat the RJD’s Ganesh Bharti by a comfortable 12695 vote margin, with the Congress candidate Atirek Kumar in fourth place, polling just 5623 votes. In Tarapur, the results were much closer, with counting swaying this way and then the other, with the JDU candidate Rajeev Kumar Singh eventually emerging on top by 3821 votes, beating Arun Kumar of the RJD. With the bypolls necessitated by the death of the two sitting JDU candidates, RJD leader of opposition Tejashwi Yadav said, “We accept the people’s verdict. The sympathy factor worked at both the places.” An upbeat Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, meanwhile said, “In democracy, people are the judge and people have given their verdict. I thank people for the verdict.” In Huzurabad in Telangana’s Karimnagar district, there was also good news for the BJP with Eatala Rajender wresting the seat from the TRS, winning by a margin of 23,865 votes. Rajender secured 1,06,213 votes, while the TRS candidate polled 82,348 votes. Congress candidate Balmuri Venkat, president of state NSUI, ended up with just 2,767 votes, thereby losing his deposit. With the Rajender’s victory, the BJP’s tally in the 119-member Telangana state assembly went up to three. The by-election is necessitated due to the resignation of Rajender, who was state health minister and quit the TRS and joined the BJP in June this year. He was earlier sacked from the state cabinet by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on May 2 on charges of land encroachment, prompting an election that was seen as almost a personal contest between Rajender and the Chief Minister. In neighbouring Andhra Pradesh’s Badvel constituency however, there was more humbling news for the BJP with the YSR Congress candidate Dasari Sudha beating Panathala Suresh of the BJP by a wide 90,533 vote margin. In Rajasthan, there was better news for the Congress which won both the Vallabhnagar and Dhariawad seats, wresting the latter from the BJP. In Vallabhanagar, Preeti Shaktawat beat RLP candidate Udailal Dangi with a 20606 vote margin, with the BJP finishing fourth. In Dhariawad, Nagraj Meena of the Congress beat Independent Thawar Chand with a victory margin of 18725 votes, with the BJP in third. “Congratulations and best wishes to Preeti Shaktawat, and Nagaraj Meena, for their victory in the assembly by-elections. Gratitude to the voters of both the constituencies and congratulations to the workers and leaders of the Congress party,” Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said. In Maharashtra’s Deglur, Congress’s Jitesh Antapurkar won the bypoll defeating Bharatiya Janata Party candidate Subhash Sabne by more than 41,000 votes. The victory was considered to be important for the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government in the backdrop of its emberassing defeat in the Pandharpur bypoll in which BJP had wrested the constituency from Nationalist Congress Party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jdu-retains-2-seats-in-bihar-congress-sweeps-rajasthan-101635880672482.html
03-11-2021||India||Kerala HC says ban on pets in residential areas illegal, asks state to step in||Kerala high court on Tuesday observed that clauses in by-laws of the residential associations and management that ban owners and tenants from keeping pet animals of their choice in their apartments are “illegal and unconstitutional”. A division bench of Justice AK Jayasankaran Nambiar and Justice P Gopinath, while hearing a petition of People for Animals (PFA) questioning such provisions, said, “Our coastal state, which announces itself to be the ‘god’s own country, cannot be seen denying just privileges to its animal inhabitants.” The court agreed with the PFA’s contention and said any clause in by-laws or the agreement of resident associations and builders banning pet animals in apartments should be treated as void and unenforceable law. Resident associations and resident welfare committees should also desist from putting up boards and notices prohibiting the keeping or entry of pets in their respective premises, the court said. “Time has indeed come to nudge our citizenry into respecting the claims of other living beings that too have right in our shared ecosystem. Compassion and empathy towards other living beings are the essences of civilization and we must try to preserve these values as part of our culture,” the court observed. The court also said the state should take steps to inculcate the spirit of accommodation towards animals and start awareness programmes at the school level to realise this. The state government also agreed that denying permission to occupants to keep pets of their choice while infringing their fundamental right would also hamper the fundamental freedom of animals as recognised by the law of land.In its petition, the PFA, represented by K S Hariharaputhran and Bhanu Thilak, said the association is being flooded with complaints from many pet owners after residential associations put undue restrictions on them. It also said such associations can not frame rules and regulations contrary to the law of the country. It also pointed out that many pet owners were forced to abandon their pets, and it was a cognizable offence under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960. A posh apartment in East Delhi was in news last month after many residents accused the management of harassing them for keeping pets during the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-hc-says-ban-on-pets-in-residential-areas-illegal-asks-state-to-step-in-101635880671929.html
03-11-2021||India||Justice Chandrachud rues delay in bail releases||The delay in communicating bail orders to convicts and people under trial is a “serious deficiency” of the criminal justice system that must be addressed on a war footing, Supreme Court judge, justice Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, said on Monday.Justice Chandrachud, who is chairman of the E-Committee of the Supreme Court, was speaking at an online event organised by the Allahabad high court to inaugurate virtual courts (to settle traffic offences), and 76 e-Sewa kendras to facilitate online legal assistance to litigants.“This is a very serious deficiency in our criminal justice system, that of delay in communication of bail orders, which we need to address on a war footing,” justice Chandrachud. “This touches upon the human liberty of every under-trial or a convict who has got a suspension of sentence pending the hearing on criminal appeal.”A recent example to illustrate the delay observed by the Supreme Court judge relates to the case of Bollywood actor Shahrukh Khan’s son, Aryan Khan, who spent an extra day at Mumbai’s Arthur Road jail in a drug case despite securing bail from the Bombay high court. The bail order was signed on October 28 but the release memo could not be typed out by the trial court on time.As a result, the delivery of the release order got delayed, leading to the process being completed the following day.To be sure, justice Chandrachud did not refer to this or any other specific case during the event.However, earlier this year in July, the top court came down hard on delays in executing bail orders by jail authorities after the Court came across a four-day delay to release 13 convicts of Agra Jail on bail.A bench headed by CJI NV Ramana rebuked the prison authorities for causing delay and said, “We are in a time when we use information technology tools, and we are still looking at the skies for pigeons to communicate orders... It is too much that prisoners have to wait even after the Supreme Court has granted bail as jails are insisting on the bail order to come by post.”The Supreme Court last month introduced a mechanism for speedy communication of bail orders to prisons under an electronic transmission channel known as FASTER (Fast and Secured Transmission of Electronic Records) -- an initiative that came about while the court was considering a suo moto petition based on a news report published in July where release of convicts on bail was delayed by jail authorities in Agra for want of verification of the court’s order (may be redundant if same as above).By an order passed in September, the Court directed Chief Secretaries of all states and union territories to extend internet facility in all jails to ensure the e-certified copies of Supreme Court can be accessed under the FASTER system, and asked the director generals of all prisons to ensure successful implementation of the initiative.During the online event on Tuesday, also attended by the chief justice of the Allahabad high court Justice Rajesh Bindal and other high court judges, justice Chandhrachud spoke about an e-custody certificate started by the Orissa high court. “Every under-trial and every convict who is undergoing a sentence of imprisonment would have an e-custody certificate tagged to them. That certificate will give us all data with regard to that particular under-trial or convict, right from initial remand to the subsequent progress of each case. This will also help us in ensuring that bail orders are communicated as soon as they are made,” justice Chandrachud said.The judge, who has been a champion of human liberty, has in the past expressed similar views when it comes to release of prisoners on bail. Last November, a bench of the Supreme Court headed by him held a special sitting and granted bail to journalist Arnab Goswami and two others in an alleged abetment to suicide case.While ordering the release of the three, the bench said, “We are dealing with a person’s liberty. If this court is not to interfere today, we are treading on a path of destruction of liberty.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-to-address-delay-in-communicating-bail-orders-on-a-war-footing-justice-chandrachud-101635880670784.html
03-11-2021||India||Constable killed, cop injured as rain lashes Chennai||A woman constable posted at the state secretariat in Chennai died while another policeman got injured after a tree fell on them Tuesday morning, the police said. The large tree, which is near chief minister MK Stalin’s cell, was uprooted due to rainfall around 9 am. The deceased constable has been identified as Kavitha, while the injured policeman, Murugan, was rushed to a government hospital, a police official said. Following the incident, Tamil Nadu director general of police (DGP) C Sylendra Babu visited the spot and supervised the tree removal conducted by the fire and rescue personnel. Chief minister Stalin granted ₹10 lakh as solatium to Kavitha’s family and paid respects to her body. He also visited the injured policeman at the hospital. The incident comes a day after 32-year-old software engineer Mohammad Yunus got killed after hitting a pothole on Chennai’s busy arterial road Anna Salai. The Tamil Nadu highways department, which maintains the road, has begun work on Tuesday to cover several potholes along the road, the police said. Barricades were also put up over the newly-covered potholes on the road. CCTV footage of the accident shows the techie, who was riding a two-wheeler on Anna Salai skid, losing his balance and falling under the rear wheel of a government bus (Metropolitan Transport Corporation-MTC) amid heavy rainfall on Monday. Soon after the accident, the Guindy traffic police rushed to the spot and found the victim dead. The highways department has said that the pothole was caused by a private company, which provides internet and dug up the road to lay the cables. “We haven’t made any arrests yet as we are discussing who is accountabe and who should be named as the accused,” said inspector Kamala Devi of the Guindy traffic police. “Three sections are involved – the highways, the private company and the bus driver.” Tamil Nadu government declared a holiday for schools in nine districts including Chennai, Chengalpattu, Mayiladuthurai, Kancheepuram, Cuddalore, Villupuram and Ariyalur after northeast monsoon picked up pace in the state. Schools for Class 1 to 8 reopened on November 1 as educational institutes were shut due to the Covid-19 pandemic. A holiday was also announced for colleges in Chennai, and the city was inundated in several parts. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) in its bulletin on Tuesday noted that there has been significant rainfall over the past five days and warned of heavy to very heavy rainfall in districts of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. According to the observations of the Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) as of 5.3-pm on Tuesday, Cuddalore received the highest rainfall of 116.3 mm, Coimbatore received 35.8 mm rainfall and Chennai witnessed 41.2 mm rainfall. “The next 48-hours, there will be thunderstorms with moderate rains, heavy at times in some areas,” said a statement from the RMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/constable-killed-cop-injured-as-rain-lashes-chennai-101635880669507.html
03-11-2021||India||Kerala high court grants bail to Swapna, 7 others in UAPA case||The Kerala high court on Tuesday granted bail to Swapna Suresh and seven others in the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) case registered by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in connection with sensational gold smuggling.A division bench of justices Vinod Chandran and C Jayachandran granted bail after several rounds of hearing. Besides Suresh, those getting bail in the case, include Mohammed Shafi P, Jalal AM, Rabins Hameed, Ramees KT, Sharafudeen KT, Sarith PS and Mohammed Ali.While Suresh had earlier secured bail in cases registered by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Customs in connection with the gold smuggling earlier, she will be released after spending 15 months in prison. Suresh’s mother hailed the decision, saying, “She is innocent and I feel she was made a pawn by others.” Advocate Sooraj T Elenjickal, who represented Suresh, said the grant of bail in the NIA case, she can come out of judicial custody as her preventive detention under the COFEPOSA (Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act) had been recently set aside by the high court.The senior lawyer, however, added that this may not be true for the other accused in the gold smuggling case. The detailed order is yet to be made available.NIA last year filed a charge sheet against 20 people under various sections of the UAPA saying proceeds from smuggling activities were diverted for anti-national activities. Additional solicitor general SV Raju, who appeared for NIA, opposed their bail petitions, saying they were kingpins behind a thriving smuggling racket and charges against them were grave. However, counsels for the accused contended that in the charge sheet filed after the completion of investigation, there was no mention of terror funding or involvement of transnational forces. The court relied upon an earlier observation of another bench in February that said mere act of gold smuggling, covered under the Customs Act, will not amount to a terrorist act under the provisions of the UAPA. The court also observed that smuggling was done for mere profit motive and that will not come under the ambit of the UAPA. Besides this, the trial in the case is not likely to begin in near future and they can’t remain in jail till then, the court said. The sensational gold smuggling case came to light in July 2020 after the seizure of 30 kg gold hidden in bathroom fittings in one of the consignments camouflaged as diplomatic baggage of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) consulate in Thiruvananthapuram. The case was later handed over to NIA and it arrested Suresh and her accomplice Sandeep Nair from their hideout in Bengaluru.Later, a multi-agency team headed by NIA started probing the case and 34 people were arrested. One of the alleged key funders of the smuggling racket, Rabins Hameed, was extradited from the UAE and another key suspect Faizal Fareed is still at large. The case invited enough embarrassment to the Left front government after the chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s principal secretary M Sivasankar, a senior IAS officer, was arrested by ED. He was later suspended before he secured bail from the high court.Though five central agencies (NIA, ED, DRI, Customs and Income Tax) were probing the case, other than initial arrests, investigation failed to make much headway, officials of the central agencies admit. Main beneficiaries and dispatchers are still at large and some politicians whose names cropped up in the course of investigation also remain untouched.The Union and state governments locked horns several times over the case and the latter even constituted a judicial commission against ED, a first of its sort, alleging bid to implicate many senior leaders including Vijayan in the case. However, the HC squashed the judicial commission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-high-court-grants-bail-to-swapna-7-others-in-uapa-case-101635880668248.html
03-11-2021||India||BJP emerges victorious in Sindgi, Congress comes second||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) secured a victory in Sindgi, snatching another seat from the Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S), who had won the constituency in 2018. Ramesh Bhusanur of the BJP led from the very beginning in the seat that fell vacant after the demise of MC Managuli in January, further eroding the JD(S) numbers in north Karnataka where its presence is limited to a few stray seats. As per data from the ECI, the JD(S) managed to secure only 4,353 votes or 2.66% vote share.Bhusanur secured 93,865 votes with 57.31% of the vote share as against his closest competitor, Ashok Managuli of the Congress who managed to secure 62,680 votes or 38.27% of the vote share, data from Election Commission of India (ECI) showed at 3.45 pm. Managuli’s son, Ashok, had joined the Congress just before the bypolls, further aggravating the JD(S). Managuli lost the seat with a margin of nearly 30,000 votes, data from the election commission of India (ECI) showed. “Ramesh Bhusanur has won with a margin of over 30,000 votes which was beyond our expectations,” BS Yediyurappa, who had spent a few days campaigning in the constituency said on Tuesday. The Congress was banking on the sympathy wave to help Managuli’s son, Ashok, win the seat. But with no development platform, the campaigning had turned extremely personal between the senior leadership of all three parties.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had deployed its entire cabinet and senior leadership in both constituencies to help Bommai secure the first electoral battle since he took over as chief minister on July 28. “In Sindgi we were in third place (in 2018). Before Managuli died, he met us and showed interest in joining the Congress. Compare the previous elections and this one, if we see the votes, it is some satisfaction for us,” DK Shivakumar, the president of the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) said. Former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda too had campaigned in Sindgi, hoping to retain the seat with the regional party that appears to have come down to under 30 seats with recent losses and defections. “They called JD(S) as BJP’s “B” Team with malafide intent and the bypoll results is the right answer to them,” HD Kumaraswamy, the JD(S) leader and former chief minister had said. The JD(S) was also accused of fielding a minority candidate in both constituencies to split the Muslim vote and help the BJP win.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-emerges-victorious-in-sindgi-congress-comes-second-101635880608350.html
03-11-2021||India||After Puneeth Rajkumar’s death, Karnataka plans guidelines for gyms||Days after the untimely demise of Kannada actor Puneeth Rajkumar, the Karnataka government is planning to bring in a guideline for gyms in the state. The 46-year-old actor passed away due to a cardiac arrest following an intense session at the gym on October 29. It still remains unclear if the intense training resulted in his death, but Karnataka health minister K Sudhakar on Monday said that the state government could bring guidelines for gymnasiums and fitness centres to meet any health-related emergencies at their premises. “After the untimely demise of Kannada film star Puneeth Rajkumar, several people have been asking me if exercising in gyms was safe at all. It is not right to think so due to stray cases,” he told reporters in Chikkaballapur. He said that he was getting a summary prepared by renowned cardiologists that would be provided to gymnasiums and fitness centers across the state. “The guidelines will be on the type of equipment to be used in the gym and training the trainers to handle an emergency with first aid training,” the minister said. Puneeth’s doctor Dr Ramana Rao, who diagnosed the actor hours before his death on Friday, said there was a strain in his heart. Rao said that Puneeth came to the clinic along with his wife complaining of weakness and didn’t mention any pain. Describing the death, sudden death, or cardiac arrest, Rao said that it is difficult to ascertain the reason for this untimely demise. “(On Friday) around 11.15 am or 11.20 am, Puneeth and his wife Ashwini came to the clinic. I took him almost immediately and he told me that he was just returning from the gym. He also said that apart from his usual routine, he did an additional session of boxing and used steam room extensively,” explained Rao. When Rao pointed out that the actor was sweating a lot, Puneeth said it was normal for him when returned from the gym. “Not to take any chances, within a minute, I checked his ECG. In the ECG we could see strain (in the heart), even though his heartbeat was normal. I didn’t want Appu (Puneeth) to hear this, so I told Ashwini to hospitalize him soon,” said Rao. On his way from the clinic to the hospital, the actor breathed his last.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-puneeth-rajkumar-s-death-karnataka-plans-guidelines-for-gyms-101635880370821.html
03-11-2021||India||Congress makes a dent in BJP bastion Hanagal||The Congress in Karnataka snatched victory in Hanagal constituency from the hands of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) who has won here three times in the last five elections since 2004. The Congress had last won Hanagal in 2013.The Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S) managed only 927 votes according to data from Election Commission of India (ECI) at 9.30 pm. There were 529 votes for NOTA or none of the above options to express no confidence in any of the contesting candidates.CM Udasi has been the candidate from this constituency since 1985 when he was first elected as an independent and has since won five times from the seat. He had lost in 2013 when he followed BS Yediyurappa into the newly formed Karnataka Janata Party (KJP) which was later merged back with the BJP after the saffron outfit was routed in the 2013 assembly elections.The BJP’s loss in Hanagal is also seen as a ‘setback’ to chief minister Basavaraj Bommai, as it is the neighbouring constituency to his Shiggaon assembly segment in Haveri district, where he had extensively campaigned. This was also the first major electoral challenge for Bommai, after taking charge as CM in July this year.Reacting after the defeat, Bommai said,“In Hanagal, we did not get as many votes as we expected. We did fight but CM Udasi died and the votes that he used to get, we couldn’t”.Shivaraj Sajjanar of the BJP lost in Hanagal as he managed 80,117 votes or 46.5% of the vote share as against Srinivas Mane of the Congress who got 87,490 votes or 50.9% of the votes.While Bommai was gracious to acknowledge the good work done by Srinivas Mane, the Congress candidate, the loss is likely to hurt the chief minister and the BJP.Former chief minister and senior Congress leader Siddaramaiah on Tuesday said the defeat of the BJP candidate in Hanagal assembly bypoll is actually the defeat of chief minister Basavaraj Bommai as the constituency falls in his home constituency.Taking a dig at the BJP, the Congress stalwart in a series of tweets said, “In the Hanagal election, the actual BJP candidate was chief minister Basavaraj Bommai. The BJP lost in his home district. The fact is that the people have discarded him despite his emotional talks such as ‘I am the son of the soil’, ‘I will die here’ and ‘I am the son-in-law of this area’.” “I won’t say that this (bypoll result) is an indicator (for 2023). But this is a wake up call that people have used. People want change in Karnataka,” he further said.Hitting back at the Congress, BS Yediyurappa said that the party should not act like it has “achieved something great” as there is no doubt that the BJP would return to power in 2023 on its own.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-makes-a-dent-in-bjp-bastion-hanagal-101635880369328.html
03-11-2021||India||Inspired by celebrities, organ donations record a significant increase in rural Karnataka||Convincing people of rural Karnataka, especially in north Karnataka, to donate organs has been a difficult task for officials over the decades. Thanks to celebrities who have come forward to pledge and donate their organs, the number of donors have increased in recent years, especially in smaller towns and villages. On August 20, 19-year-old Mahesh Revanasiddappa, a resident of Laad Mugali village of Kalburgi in north Karnataka, fell from the upper floor of the building and was declared brain dead. In the following days, his family’s decision to donate his organs gave a new life to four people. His liver was given to a 24-year-old, two kidneys went to two men aged 37 and 39 years while his corneas were donated to a person as well. According to officials of Jeevana Sarthakathe, the nodal agency for organ donations in the state, this was the third organ donation from Chirayu hospital in Kalburgi in two years, which according to them is an important sign. “For years, the number of organ donations from small cities has been very minimal, but this trend is changing. Small cities are coming up for organ donations,” said Lijamol Joseph, chief transplant coordinator for the state. One of the reasons for the increased awareness among the rural population has been celebrities pledging and donating their organs. “There is a big change in attitude. Earlier, we had to sit with families and convince them, but now they are coming forward to offer organs once they realize the medical condition of the family members,” said Joseph. She added the family of actor Sanchari Vijay coming forward to donate his organs has had a big impact. 38-year-old Vijay was declared brain dead on June 15, after he met with a motorcycle accident. “The decision of the actor’s family to come forward to offer his organs had made the headlines and this has helped spread the message among the rural areas, Joseph added. “The news (of actor’s organ donation) has traveled to the rural parts, and we see more people talking about it. This is a good sign. We are happy with how things are changing but as much awareness about organ donation is needed,” she said. Similarly, four corneal blind patients received eyesight, thanks to Kannada actor Puneeth Rajkumar. The actor’s eyes were donated on Friday afternoon soon after his demise. Doctors who extracted the eyes said that due to the lockdown, there has been a big reduction in the number of donations, and the actor’s gesture is expected to increase the numbers. The actor’s eyes were donated on Friday afternoon in keeping with his father’s promise. As of August, there are 5,056 patients listed for organ transplants. Out of this, 3,756 patients require kidneys, followed by 1,084 patients who need liver transplantation. There is a requirement for 113 heart transplants, 48 lung transplants and there are 22 patients who require both heart and lungs. As per the records of Jeevana Sarthakathe, the donations of organs had dropped drastically during the pandemic. While the state saw 105 donations in 2019, this number dropped to 35 in 2020. The increase in the number of donations in 2021 is however giving hope. Until August 2021, the number of donations has already gone past the numbers in 2020. Officials believe that if the number of donations could surpass the numbers in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/inspired-by-celebrities-organ-donations-record-a-significant-increase-in-rural-karnataka-101635880368229.html
03-11-2021||India||JD(S) draws a blank; HDK slams Congress||The Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S) lost both bypoll constituencies on Tuesday despite former prime minister HD Deve Gowda and his former chief minister HD Kumarswamy campaigning in person.Niyaz Shaikh of the JD(S) could secure only 927 votes or 0.54% of the vote share in Hanagal while Naziya Angadi managed 4,353 votes or 2.66% of the share in Sindgi, according to the Election Commission of India (ECI) data at 8.20 pm on Tuesday.JD(S) had won Sindgi in 2018 but the seat fell vacant after MC Managuli died this January and his son, Ashok Managuli, decided to contest on a Congress ticket.“In both places, when you see the votes, the Congress got their answer for its allegations that we were trying to help the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) win,” Kumaraswamy said.He was referring to allegations made by the Congress that the JD(S) had fielded two Muslim candidates and tried to bad-mouth the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) to split the minority vote and tacitly help the BJP.Kumaraswamy said that their candidate was “hijacked” by the Congress in Sindgi. He also said that the party had problems even in identifying its own workers in these regions, indicating a lack of grassroot level connection beyond the Old-Mysuru region.Reacting on JD(S) losing both the constituencies, senior Congress leader Siddaramaiah said, “I had said in the beginning, just because you put up a minority candidate, they won’t vote for you. They are intelligent. They know that you have an internal understanding with communal forces.”Deve Gowda, after the defeat on Tuesday said that the BJP had spent more money than the Congress in these parts. He, however, stated that the JD(S) will undertake a state-wide tour and mobilise support for 2023.More importantly, the JD(S) lost another seat in the assembly that further brought down the regional outfit’s tally in the lower house.Since the 2018 assembly polls, three legislators defected to the BJP and three others have openly aired their intent to join the Congress. These three who have made up their minds to leave--Srinivas Gowda, GT Deve Gowda and Gubbi Srinivas--are from south Karnataka where the JD(S) draws most of its strength in numbers from.Despite never having secured a majority, since the turn of the century, JD (S) has allied with both national parties on various levels and Kumaraswamy was made chief minister even when the party had just 38 seats as against 80 of the Congress in the previous elections. But the party has been on a downslide ever since the 2019 assembly elections when Kumaraswamy’s son, Nikhil, lost in its stronghold of Mandya and Deve Gowda lost in Tumakuru.Analysts said that it was hard to rule out the JD(S) since they derive their strength from dissent in either party. The JD(S), a primarily Vokkaliga-backed party, won in regions outside of south-Karnataka only based on the candidate’s ability to win and not on the party symbol, they added.“Post 2019, there has been some deep churning within the party. There were a few people who left but many others did not leave immediately,” said a Bengaluru-based analyst, requesting not to be named.The analyst said that JD(S) had given tickets to disgruntled elements from both national parties which became a way to “self-sustenance” as it continues to “rise from the ashes” each time it appears to be on the brink of oblivion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jds-draws-a-blank-hdk-slams-congress-101635880310040.html
03-11-2021||India||Setback for BJP as party loses in Karnataka CM’s turf||Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai suffered a significant setback as the Congress stole a victory in Hanagal in his district, Haveri, about 335 km from Bengaluru.Srinivas Mane, the Congress candidate, won after he secured 87,490 votes and 50.95% of the vote, defeating Shivaraj Sajjanar of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) who won 80,117 votes.The BJP got 46.45% of the votes.The defeat in Bommai’s first electoral test added to speculation that all may not be well within the state unit of BJP.“I got all the cooperation from the leaders we asked,” Bommai said in Bengaluru, reacting to the defeat in Hanagal and seeking to scotch rumours that some in his own party may have wanted Sajjanar to lose. Some analysts partially attributed the defeat to the lack of support from the Panchamasalis, the largest sub-sect of the dominant Lingayat community, upset over an unfulfilled reservation-related request.The chief minister, who earlier claimed that the bypoll will be an indicator to the 2023 polls in the state, walked back his earlier statement. “These elections are fought on that particular time and issues so it doesn’t give a verdict to the entire thing. I have taken this election setback very seriously,” Bommai said.He listed three reasons for the loss; one was that the BJP did not get the same support that the party’s now deceased legislator, CM Udasi, did, second, the Congress candidates had done good work in the last 2-3 years, including during Covid-19.The BJP secured a resounding victory in the other assembly seat, Sindgi, defeating the Congress by over 30,000 votes. The Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S) has effectively lost another seat in the 224-seater lower house of the state legislature. MC Managuli of the JD(S) won this seat in 2018 but died earlier this year, necessitating the bypolls.DK Shivakumar, the KPCC president on Tuesday said that the BJP lost in Hangal despite being in power. “In Hangal, the result was as we expected. We thought we would win with a 10,000-15,000 difference. There was dissatisfaction against the BJP over price rise, corruption, and an incoherent government. Bommai and a dozen ministers camped there for a week. The neighbouring constituency is Shiggaon (Bommai’s constituency). He even made it a prestige battle, was present there, misused power, distributed money, but we still won,” Siddaramaiah, the leader of the opposition in the state assembly said.CM Udasi of the BJP died in June and his son, Shivakumar Udasi (BJP MP from Haveri-Gadag seat) demanded that the ticket be given to his wife. This, however, was not to be the case, adding to the already growing differences within the ruling party. Shivakumar Udasi was also overlooked during the recent reshuffle of the union cabinet. The loss piles the pressure on Bommai who has to cope with dissent, is perceived to be under the control of former CM BS Yediyurappa, and has to deal with allegations of a multi-million dollar corruption scandal in which the opposition Congress has accused Bommai of purchasing Bitcoins over ₹2600 crore and the growing clamour of reservation by dominant and marginalised communities. Bommai has borne the burden of assurances made by his predecessor, Yediyurappa.Basava Jaya Mrityunjaya Swami, an influential seer of the Panchamsali, issued a veiled threat against the Bommai government and even mentioned that in both constituencies, Panchamasalis were the deciding vote.Vijayananda Kashyappanavar, the former Congress MLA and president of the Akhila Bharatha Lingayat Panchamasali Mahasabha said that in both constituencies, the BJP had not given a ticket to a member of this community. Even the election incharge and state industries minister, Murugesh Nirani, is from the same community and was overlooked for the post of chief minister, people familiar with the matter said. The BJP also lost another constituency Maski and saw its difference in parliamentary constituency Belagavi, about 4 lakhs in 2019, shrink to a few thousand, both in the May bypolls. “Losing Hangal is a big thing for the BJP. There was more focus on Hangal from the government ,” said A Narayana, political analyst and faculty at the Azim Premji University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/setback-for-bjp-as-party-loses-in-karnataka-cm-s-turf-101635880308695.html
03-11-2021||India||BJP retains MP LS seat; first win for Shiv Sena outside Maharashtra||In by-polls to three Lok Sabha seats, the Bharatiya Janata Party retained Khandwa in Madhya Pradesh but lost Mandi in Himachal Pradesh to the Congress. In Dadra and Nagar Haveli, the Shiv Sena registered its first ever LS victory outside Maharashtra, with the party’s Kalaben Delkar winning the seat .Her late husband, Mohan Delkar, died by suicide in a Mumbai hotel in February, and was the sitting independent MP from there. In his note he blamed top officials of the Union Territory, including the administrator Praful Patel for his death. A case has been filed in Mumbai on the basis of the 15-page letter and the statement of Delkar’s son. Kalaben Delkar defeated the BJP’s Mahesh Gavit by 51,269 votes. Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut called it a “historic” victory for the party. “First step outside Maharashtra, giant leap towards Delhi via Dadra Nagar Haveli!,” he tweeted. With this victory, the Shiv Sena now has 19 MPs in Lok Sabha and is the sixth largest party in the house after the BJP, Congress, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagham (DMK), YSR Congress and Trinamool Congress.From Mandi, Congress candidate, Pratibha Singh, wife of former chief minister, the late Virbhadra Singh, won by 7,490 votes, defeating BJP candidate Brigadier Khushal Chand Thakur (retd). A former two-term member of Parliament from Mandi, Pratibha polled 3,69,565 votes, while her BJP rival Brigadier Khushal Chand Thakur (retd) got 3,62,075 votes. The election was necessitated by the death earlier this year of Ram Swaroop Sharma from the BJP. Mandi is home district of Himachal chief minister Jairam Thakur, who accepted the defeat, said that sympathy factor for Virbhadra Singh who died in July this year, especially in the tribal areas of Kinnaur and Lahaul and Spiti worked in favour of the Congress. “The Congress also took benefit of the issue of rising prices,” he said. The BJP won Mandi seat in 2019 Lok Sabha elections by a margin of 3.5 lakh votes. In Madhya Pradesh’s Khandwa, BJP candidate Gyaneshwar Patil defeated Congress candidate Rajnarayan Singh by 81,500 votes. After death of senior BJP leader and five-time Member of Parliament (MP), Nand Kumar Singh Chauhan, BJP gave ticket to OBC leader Patil. In the 2019 Lok Sabha poll the winning margin for BJP was 2,4 lakh votes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-retains-mp-ls-seat-first-win-for-shiv-sena-outside-maharashtra-101635880010055.html
03-11-2021||India||Income Tax department attaches properties linked to Ajit Pawar across 3 states||The Income Tax (I-T) department has provisionally attached properties allegedly linked to Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar in Maharashtra, Delhi and Goa, officials aware of the matter said on Tuesday.According to officials in the investigation wing of Maharashtra’s I-T department, the value of the properties spread over the three states is ₹1,000 crore.The action was taken after the I-T department allegedly discovered details of unaccounted income of about ₹184 crore during searches carried out for five days in the first week of October at 70 premises of two Mumbai-based real estate groups, individuals, and entities allegedly linked to Pawar and his family in Mumbai, Pune, Baramati, Goa, and Jaipur last month.The department in a statement on October 15 said that incriminating documents mentioning the unaccounted income were found during the raids.Pawar’s lawyer Prashant Patil, however, said no property related to the deputy chief minister has been attached by the I-T department and he has also not received any notice. He termed reports of attachment of Pawar’s properties as baseless and misleading. Pawar has also denied the reports.“None of his properties were attached by the I-T department nor he has received any notice in this regard. The I-T department has sought clarification related to some issues. An appropriate response will be given on that particular letter. Appropriate action will also be taken through administrative and legal means… News coming in this regard in the media are baseless and misleading. The media should verify the facts before reporting and do not fall prey to any propaganda,”a statement issued by Patil said.The department is yet to issue any statement on the attachment but officials cited above said the action was taken under the Prohibition of the Benami Property Transactions Act, 1988. The attached assets include an office building at a prime location in Mumbai, a flat in an upscale Delhi locality, a resort in Goa, agricultural land, and a sugar mill in Maharashtra, the officials said.Funds obtained in a “dubious manner” were allegedly utilised for the acquisition of these properties, they added.Bharatiya Janata Party leader and former MP Kirit Somaiya alleged that Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Ajit Pawar and his family owned the properties attached. “The properties include Jarandeshwar sugar factory worth ₹600 crore, an office owned by Parth Ajit Pawar in South Mumbai worth ₹25 crore, a flat in south Delhi worth ₹20 crore, and a resort named NIlaya in Goa worth ₹250 crore. The properties... are owned by Ajit Pawar, his wife Sunetra, his mother, his son, sisters, and Mohan Patil, son-in-law.”HT could not independently verify the claim.After the searches last month, the I-T department claimed through a statement that there was a suspicious flow of funds allegedly involving an “influential family from Maharashtra,” without naming Pawar or his family. However, department officials who asked not to be named said the family in question was that of Ajit Pawar.The I-T department then carried out searches in the first week of October at the residences of Pawar’s three sisters and son, Parth, who is directly/indirectly linked to properties under tax department’s scanner.Pawar, after the searches, described the agency’s action “harassment”, and alleged government departments were being misused against his family for political reasons.The IT- department, however, has maintained that the searches led to the identification of transactions by business groups with a web of companies that, prima facie, appear to be suspicious.“A preliminary analysis of the flow of funds indicates that there has been an introduction of unaccounted funds in the group by way of various dubious methods like the introduction of bogus share premium, suspicious unsecured loans, receipt of unsubstantiated advance for certain services, collusive arbitration deals out of non-existent disputes, etc,” the agency said in its statement on October 15.It added the value of assets allegedly acquired through funds obtained in a “dubious manner” was about ₹170 crore. The department claimed to have seized unaccounted cash of ₹2.13 crore and jewellery worth ₹4.32 crore during the five-day search operation.Sharad Pawar reacted strongly to the searches, saying the action reeks of abuse of power. He linked it to the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) reaction to his position on the Lakhimpur Kheri violence.The NCP is part of the Shiv Sena-led government in Maharashtra, which has had frequent run-ins with the BJP-led central government over the alleged misuse of central agencies.Ajit Pawar last month refuted allegations that he and his family bought the sugar factories for paltry prices. “There are no irregularities involved in the purchase of any sugar factories. The factories were auctioned following all norms,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/income-tax-department-attaches-properties-linked-to-ajit-pawar-across-3-states-101635879948264.html
03-11-2021||India||All is well in Punjab Congress, will win 2022 elections: Harish Rawat||Despite the ongoing conflict in Punjab Congress, party leader Harish Rawat on Tuesday said that all is well in the state and expressed confidence in its victory in the assembly elections next year.“I had said this earlier, the party is now functioning smoothly in Punjab. Whatever challenges there are, will be faced. I am confident this scenario will continue and you will see Congress win the elections,” Rawat told reporters after meeting Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi and state unit chief Navjot Singh Sidhu, among others, here.Both Sidhu and Channi have been at loggerheads with each other over a few senior appointments in the Punjab cabinet.Rawat also expressed confidence in the leadership of the newly-appointed Punjab and Chandigarh units’ in-charge, Harish Chaudhary, saying it is taking the party towards victory in the state.“Harish Chaudhary is someone you can learn from. This is taking us towards victory in Punjab. Congress will win,” he said.Rawat, who earlier served as Punjab Congress in-charge, was replaced by Harish Chaudhary last week months ahead of the elections.Besides Sidhu and Channi, Rawat also met Chaudhary and Punjab Assembly speaker Rana K P Singh, all of whom visited Kedarnath after that.“We bow before all those who come for darshan of Kedarbaba. Whether it is all the leaders from Punjab, or (Prime Minister) Narendra Modi, I pray to Kedarbaba for the welfare of all and showing them a path to progress ahead,” Rawat said.Channi was appointed as the chief minister after his predecessor, Captain Amarinder Singh, resigned following a revolt by Sidhu and several ministers and legislators. However, the change of guard did not end the rift in the state Congress as Sidhu and Channi, who is the first SC chief minister of Punjab, are not on the same page over several issues.On Monday, Sidhu attacked politicians who offer ‘lollipops’ just ahead of the elections and urged people to give their votes on the agenda of Punjab’s welfare.Though the former cricketer did not name anyone, his speech was seen in Congress circles as a direct attack on Channi, who announced slashing of power tariff by ₹3 per unit for the domestic category and increasing the dearness allowance for the government employees and pensioners.Meanwhile, Sidhu shared a photo of his visit to Kedarnath on Twitter, saying: “Life is fragile, handle with prayer ….

03-11-2021||India||Central Vista project: Kamladityya lowest bidder for V-P enclave||Kamladityya Construction Pvt Ltd (KCPL) has emerged as the lowest bidder for the construction and maintenance of the new Vice President’s enclave, part of the Central Vista redevelopment project, according to financial bids opened on Tuesday.The ₹214-crore project, which will come up on a 15-acre plot adjacent to North Block and abutting President’s estate, is expected to be complete within 10 months from the start of construction activity.As per the financial bids received by the Central Public Works Department (CPWD), KCPL has quoted ₹206.49 crore, which is nearly 3.52% less than the government’s estimate of ₹214.03 crore for the construction of the V-P enclave.“The lowest bidder generally gets the contract, but a final decision in this regard will be taken by the Central Works Board,” a senior CPWD official said, asking not to be named.The selected construction firm will also be responsible for the maintenance of the complex for a period of five years.KCPL has its headquarters in Bokaro, Jharkhand. HT called up on the numbers available on the company’s website, but couldn’t contact company officials.CPWD, which is the nodal agency for the execution of the Central Vista Project, received six financial bids for the project -- of which five were higher than the department’s estimated cost. The second lowest bid received was of ₹220.02 crore from SAM India Builtwell Pvt Ltd.The other four companies which submitted the financial bids are: Ahluwalia contracts (India) limited ( ₹268.76 crore), DEE VEE Projects limited ( ₹238.86 crore), PSP projects Ltd (252.56 crore) and Swadeshi Civil Infrastructure Pvt Ltd ( ₹229.33 crore), according to CPWD officials.In August, 12 construction firms participated in the pre-qualification bids for the project of which only nine firms qualified to apply for financial bids.The enclave is the fourth main component of the ₹13,500 crore Central Vista redevelopment project. As per the proposed plan, the enclave will have the Vice President’s residence, secretariat, sports facility, guest house, and housing facility for security services and staff. Most of the buildings will be double storeyed (ground plus one) and the total built-up area will be around 20,000 sq m, as per the tender document.The initial project cost was ₹192 crore, as per the pre-qualification bid document.“The construction work is likely to start by December this year,” the CPWD official quoted above said.In October 2020, the Centre changed the land-use of the plot in the Master Plan of Delhi-2021 from transportation (bus terminal/parking) and recreational to residential for the redevelopment project. This change in land use has been challenged in the Supreme Court, and the apex court recently sought the Centre’s reply on the petition.In response to the petition, the Centre told the apex court last week that the Central Vista plots sought to be made the new residences of the Prime Minister and Vice President have never been open for any public recreational purpose. Explaining why the Vice President’s residence was proposed for construction on Plot No. 1, the Centre said, “This will in turn help in easing the traffic situation in Central Vista as the movement of Vice President will be mainly to the Parliament when in session. This will be well facilitated by the proposed Vice President Residence being in close proximity to the Parliament.” The matter will come up for hearing on November 16.Meanwhile, the construction work of the new Parliament building and Central Vista Avenue are in full swing. The new Parliament building is expected to be ready by October-November next year, while the revamped Central Vista Avenue will be ready by December.CPWD is in the process of awarding the work for the construction of first three buildings of the proposed Common Central Secretariat (a set of 10 buildings that will house all the 51 central ministries) to Larsen and Toubro Ltd. The construction and infrastructure major was the lowest bidder for the ₹3,254-crore project. L&T’s bid ( ₹3,141.99) was 3.47% less than the government’s estimated cost.The three buildings of the common secretariat will come up where Indira Gandhi Centre for the Arts (IGNCA) was earlier located. IGNCA has been temporarily relocated to the renovated Janpath hotel, and a new IGNCA complex will be constructed at Jamnagar House.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/central-vista-project-kamladityya-lowest-bidder-for-v-p-enclave-101635879708304.html
03-11-2021||India||Won’t attend meeting of senior regional security officials in India on Afghanistan situation: Pak NSA||New Delhi: Pakistan’s National Security Adviser (NSA) Moeed Yusuf on Tuesday said that he will not attend a meeting of senior regional security officials being hosted by India to discuss the situation in Afghanistan. Besides China and Pakistan, countries such as Iran, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan have been invited to the meeting expected to be held in New Delhi on November 10. There are no plans to invite the Taliban to the meeting in line with the Indian government’s decision not to rush into recognising the current dispensation in Kabul.“I will not be going,” Yusuf told a news briefing in Islamabad after a meeting with his Uzbekistan counterpart Victor Makhmudov. He was responding to a question from a reporter on whether he would attend the meeting in India.“A spoiler cannot try to be a peacemaker,” he added, in an apparent reference to India.In response to another question, Yusuf said that Pakistan has identified India as a hurdle to regional efforts to establish peace and security.“Pakistan has said repeatedly that if India is prepared to move forward, then we will also be ready. But there are some prerequisites and an enabling environment for moving forward,” he said.Among the prerequisites is addressing the Kashmir issue, he said, adding that he didn’t see how the two sides could move forward in view of the Indian government’s policies and ideology.The Indian side earlier planned to convene a similar meeting in April, with the participation of the former Ashraf Ghani government. However, this was scrapped due to the second wave of coronavirus infections in India and the rapidly evolving situation in Afghanistan at the time.India recently participated in a meeting of the Moscow Format that was also joined by senior Taliban leaders. Indian officials also held talks with the Taliban leaders on the margins of the meeting in Moscow.Iran also convened a meeting of regional countries to discuss the situation in Afghanistan, though India was not invited to the meet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wont-attend-meeting-of-senior-regional-security-officials-in-india-on-afghanistan-situation-pak-nsa-101635879528081.html
03-11-2021||India||WHO panel likely to discuss emergency use of Covaxin today||A World Health Organization technical committee is scheduled to meet on Wednesday for a closely watched decision on giving an emergency use listing (EUL) to Covaxin, which will amount to a recognition and help pave the way for people who have taken the dose to qualify for vaccine mandates in other countries.Bharat Biotech has been stuck in a regulatory loop, with independent technical experts of the UN health body taking longer to analyse the data that previously disclosed timelines. The panel, WHO’s Technical Advisory Group for Emergency Use Listing (TAG-EUL), sought more clarification from the vaccine maker on October 26. A person aware of the matter said Bharat Biotech responded with the clarifications this past weekend, submitting additional data that included immunogenicity response in people 60 years and above, and separate data for responses in men and women.“More data that was asked for has been submitted, and now it is for the technical team to assess and take a decision,” this person added.Earlier, a decision on Covaxin EUL was expected on October 5, after WHO representatives sought additional information on September 27. TAG-EUL is an independent advisory group that provides recommendations to WHO on whether a Covid 19 vaccine can be listed for emergency use under the EUL procedure. Experts said it may just be a matter of time before a EUL is granted to Covaxin. “It looks like the company will be granted EUL soon as it has been submitting whatever data is sought from them. It looks like a minor issue,” said Dr NK Mehra, senior immunologist and former dean, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi. In a media briefing last week, Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya gave some details of the stage of Covaxin’s assessment at WHO. “WHO has a system in place under which one technical committee observes the data, followed by another technical committee further analysing the data. The first committee has approved the data and the approval for Covaxin will be granted on the basis of what the second committee recommends,” said Mandaviya. On October 5, WHO announced through a series of tweets that emergency use approval for Covaxin was a week away, and also that a vaccine recommended by it for emergency use must be evaluated thoroughly. “We are aware that many people are waiting for WHO’s recommendation for Covaxin to be included in the COVID19 Emergency Use Listing, but we cannot cut corners - before recommending a product for emergency use, we must evaluate it thoroughly to make sure it is safe and effective,” tweeted WHO. It clarified that the time frame for emergency approval depended on how quickly a company produced the required data. “The time frame for the WHO Emergency Use Listing procedure is dependent on how quickly a company producing the vaccine is able to provide the data required for WHO to evaluate the vaccine’s quality, safety, efficacy and its suitability for low- and middle-income countries,” read another tweet. Covaxin has shown 77.8% effectiveness against the disease, and 65.2% protection against the new highly transmissible delta variant. It is the second-most widely used coronavirus vaccine in India after Serum Institute of India’s Covishield.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/who-panel-likely-to-discuss-emergency-use-of-covaxin-today-101635879410316.html

Bypolls in these seats were necessitated after Congress MLAs from Mariani and Thawra, Rupjyoti Kurmi and Sushanta Borgohain, and All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) MLA from Bhabanipur, Phanidhar Talukdar, resigned from their parties and joined BJP between August and September this year, barely month after the assembly polls held in March-April.All three secured easy wins, as BJP candidates on Tuesday.UPPL candidates Jiron Basumatary and Jolen Daimary won from Gossaigaon and Tamulpur seats, respectively by margins of 28,252 and 57,059 votes from their nearest rivals. The two seats had turned vacant following the deaths of Bodoland Peoples’ Front (BPF) and United Peoples Party Liberal (UPPL) legislators, Majendra Narzary and Leho Ram Boro, due to Covid-19 complications, inMay this year barely weeks after winning the seats.The bypolls in the state were the first test for chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma who assumed the top post in May, replacing his predecessor from the same party, Sarbananda Sonowal.Following Tuesday’s wins, the BJP’s strength in the 126-member Assam Assembly increased to 62, with its allies UPPL and Asom Gana Parishad adding 16 more to its tally.The opposition Congress has 27 MLAs, AIUDF has 15, BPF has 3 and, CPM and newly-floated Raijor Das has 1 seat each.“We accept the people’s verdict with humility and congratulate chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on their win.

Saleh was pitted against Congress’ Ashahel D. Shira, and won by a margin of 1,926 votes.All the three seats had fallen vacant due to deaths of sitting MLAs. The BJP is a partner in the ruling coalition in the state.“The people have made their choice by ensuring the victory of our candidates… The victory is dedicated to the people who have put their trust in NPP’s capacity to take the state forward,” Meghalaya chief minister and NPP president Conrad Sangma tweeted.The bypoll results pushed NPP’s tally to 23 and UDP’s to 8 in the 60-member house. The opposition Congress now has 17 seats.In Mizoram, ruling Mizo National Front (MNF) candidate K Laldawngliana won the Tuirial seat after defeating Zoram Peoples Movement (ZPM) candidate Laltlanmawia by a margin of 1,284 votes.The election was necessitated following the death of sitting ZPM MLA, Andrew H Thangliana, in August this year.The ruling MNF, which is a partner of NDA at Centre, now has 28 seats in the 40-member assembly. While the ZPM has six, Congress has five seats. The BJP, which has only one seat, is not part of the state government.“My best wishes to K Laldawngliana who got elected from the MNF’s ticket at the Tuirial assembly bye-election. May you always be a pillar of strength for the people,” Mizoram chief minister and MNF president Zoramthanga tweeted.In Nagaland, the ruling Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party (NDPP) retained the Shamator-Chessore assembly constituency with its candidate, S Keoshu Yimchunger, being declared elected unopposed on October 13.Yimchunger, a newcomer in the state electoral politics, was the consensus candidate of the newly-formed opposition-less United Democratic Alliance (UDA) in Nagaland, where the NDPP, BJP, Naga People’s Front (NPF) and two independent MLAs are partners.The by-poll to Shamatore-Chessore seat in Nagaland Legislative Assembly was necessitated following the demise of then sitting NDPP MLA, Toshi Wungtung, in July .With Yimchunger’s victory, NDPP’s total strength in the house of 60 increased to 21, with NPF having 25 MLAs and BJP having 12. There are also two independent legislators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bypoll-results-clean-sweep-for-bjp-nda-allies-in-4-northeastern-states-101635879408987.html
03-11-2021||India||Captain Amarinder Singh quits Congress, floats new party Punjab Lok Congress||Former Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Tuesday resigned from the Indian National Congress and announced the formation of a new outfit, Punjab Lok Congress. In a seven-page resignation letter to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, the two-time former chief minister said the “midnight conspiracy” carried out against him at her and her children’s behest by calling a Congress Legislature Party (CLP) meeting over his head in the dead of the night and that too through Twitter was the most “egregious” act. “It was my prerogative as the CLP leader to have called the meeting if the AICC desired it. It was only early next morning that a colleague informed me that such an outrageous act has been committed,” he wrote. He said the crude manner in which the whole operation was executed left a very foul taste in the mouth. Singh said he felt deeply hurt by her conduct and that of her children who he still loved as much as his own children, having known their father since they were in school together in 1954. “…I hope that no other senior Congressperson is subjected to the ignominy that I was put through,” he wrote. The veteran leader resigned on September 18 following a long-drawn tussle with Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu, four cabinet ministers and several party legislators amid fears that anti-incumbency arising from his style of functioning could hurt the party’s chances in the forthcoming polls. Charanjit Singh Channi, who was among the rebel ministers, was picked by the party as the next CM of the state. Singh wrote in his letter that he was quite concerned about “inexperienced hands” handling Punjab. “It is beyond my comprehension as how these inexperienced hands will handle the security situation in view of the massive influx of weapons and explosives and narcotics. We are gravely threatened by narco-terrorism that our hostile neighbour is sponsoring against us,” he said. The veteran leader also stated that despite his reservations and over the unanimous advice of almost all the members of Parliament from Punjab, Sidhu, whom he called an acolyte of the Pakistani deep state, was appointed as the Punjab Congress president. “Sidhu’s only claim to fame was that he would abuse me and my government on a regular basis. I am old enough to be his father but that did not stop him from using the filthiest and most vile language against me both publicly and privately,” he wrote. Captain Amarinder said that rather than being reined in, Sidhu was patronised by Rahul and Priyanka, while Sonia Gandhi chose to turn a blind eye. “I told you that Sidhu is a person of unstable mind and you will one day regret this decision and it would be too late by then,” he wrote, adding, “I am sure you must be regretting it now”. Training his guns at his former colleagues over illegal sand mining, the ex-CM said that Congress MLAs and ministers, including an overwhelming number in the current government, were the offenders. “One of my enduring regrets would remain as to why I did not take some of them to task. The thought that it would embarrass the party held me back,” the former CM wrote, declaring his intent to make public their names which were provided to him by the state government and intelligence from time to time. Besides listing his achievements during his second term, particularly the state’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, and record 92% implementation of election manifesto, he also recalled, in the letter, the circumstances in which he entered politics and his journey over 52 years of public life, including the tough stance taken by him at various critical moments in Punjab’s history. On his new party, Captain Amarinder Singh said the registration of the party was pending approval with the Election Commission of India. “Since I announced that I will be forming my own party, my team of lawyers is working on the process and had applied to the Election Commission of India for the registration,” he said. He said the Election Commission has no objection to the proposed name, Punjab Lok Congress. About the party symbol, he said the EC has given three symbols from which one has to be chosen. “We have submitted three symbols and the final one will be chosen from the set of six, three suggested by the EC and three proposed by the party,” he said, adding, “The party will be formally launched later, and its policies, programmes, agenda and vision will be spelt out at the time of the launch.”“@capt_amarinder Not just me. Punjabis of entire world expect you will reveal names of ministers, political hunch men, bureaucrats & police officials responsible for drug spread & loot by sand & other mafias. And frankly do not form another party if u still have reservations,” Congress MP from Amritsar Gurjeet Singh Aujla tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/captain-amarinder-singh-quits-congress-floats-new-party-punjab-lok-congress-101635879288139.html
03-11-2021||India||India, Russia to hold 2+2 dialogue in November||India and Russia are expected to hold their first 2+2 dialogue of defence and foreign ministers in Moscow by mid-November, and this could be followed by an annual summit in December.A number of agreements in the defence, economic, trade, and science and technology spheres are expected to be signed during the summit, India’s outgoing ambassador to Russia, BV Varma said.The two sides are also set to announce the joint commission on technology and science and extend their military-technical cooperation for the period 2021-2031, Varma said in an interview with TASS news agency.Defence minister Rajnath Singh and external affairs minister S Jaishankar are expected to travel to Moscow for the first 2+2 dialogue with Russia. India has similar dialogues only with the US, Japan and Australia.Varma said both sides are working to take forward cooperation in diverse areas during the bilateral summit. “Both sides are actively working on it. There is a high possibility that the summit is taking place in December,” he said.Referring to the 2+2 dialogue, Varma said it was “important for friends like India and Russia to have an additional level of consultations”.“For example, India and Russia can have more focused cooperation in Central Asia, in the Indian Ocean region. A number of developments, including relating to Afghanistan, have created new challenges. And I think the 2+2 dialogue will be a very important addition to the architecture of dialogue that you have rightly pointed out already exists,” he said.Varma said there has been a diversification of India-Russia relations in recent years, and the Indian side is considering major projects in the energy sector and long-term arrangements for coking coal and fertilisers. In the defence field, the value of contracts had gone up from about $2-3 billion dollars a year in 2018 to about $9-10 billion dollars, he said.“We have major defence contracts already under implementation. The S-400 is one of them. We also have a contract relating to the manufacture and production of 1135.6 frigates...,” Varma said.The production of more than 700,000 AK-203 rifles will be done in India, and New Delhi is going to buy additional Su-30-MKI and MiG-29 jets and 400 more T-90 tanks, the envoy said. “Russia has moved back again as the top defence partner of India,” he added.Asked about a meeting between Indian officials and Taliban leaders on the margins of the Moscow Format meet last month, Varma said: “There was a meeting with the Taliban. We put forward our points of view, the Taliban put forward their points of view. This is the dialogue that we continue”.“No decisions were taken either way on both sides. But I think India will engage in the humanitarian situation because the humanitarian situation is quite serious and India’s always placed the well-being of the Afghan people as the topmost priority,” he added.Pavan Kapoor, an Indian Foreign Service officer of the 1990 batch and currently ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, has been appointed the next envoy to Russia. Kapoor has also served as the ambassador to Israel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-russia-to-hold-2-2-dialogue-in-november-101635879229807.html

Earlier, Mishra’s bail application was rejected by the chief judicial magistrate (CJM) court on October 13, after which he applied in the Lakhimpur district and sessions court on October 21. While hearing his application on October 28, the court had deferred the hearing till November 3. Violence had erupted at Tikunia in Lakhimpur Kheri district on October 3 when four farmers were allegedly mowed down by a speeding vehicle during a protest. A local journalist, a driver and two Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers were also killed in the subsequent violence. Two FIRs were registered in this connection: one in connection with the death of the four farmers while the second was lodged by Sumit Jaiswal, who had implicated unidentified miscreants in connection with death of the others, including two BJP workers. The minister’s son and 15 other unidentified persons had been implicated in FIR registered in connection with the mowing down of the farmers. The minister and his son have repeatedly denied Ashish Mishra’s involvement in the incident. Yadav said the court will hear the bail applications of Mishra and two other accused Luv Kush Rana and Ashish Pandey on Wednesday. The prosecution officer further said the CJM court has extended the judicial custody of 13 accused — arrested in connection with FIR registered for mowing down of farmers —till November 16. He said the court also rejected the bail plea of three accused — Rinku Rana, Dharmendra and Mohit Trivedi — in the case. On Monday, the CJM court rejected the bail applications of four accused Sumit Jaiswal, Satya Prakash alias Satyam, Nandan Singh Bisht and Shishu Pal. They are among the 13 accused arrested in connection with the FIR lodged over the mowing down of the four farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lakhimpur-kheri-violence-ashish-mishra-s-bail-plea-hearing-today-101635879109746.html
03-11-2021||India||COP26: PM Modi launches ‘Infrastructure for Resilient Island States’ for most vulnerable countries||Glasgow: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday launched the Initiative for the Resilient Island States (IRIS) for developing infrastructure of small island nations, saying it gives a new hope, a new confidence and satisfaction of doing something for the most vulnerable countries.Prime Minister Modi was joined by his British counterpart Boris Johnson on the second day of the COP26 climate summit here. The launch event was also attended by Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.“The launch of ‘Infrastructure for Resilient Island States’ gives a new hope, a new confidence,” Modi said, adding that the initiative gives the satisfaction of doing something for the most vulnerable countries.Modi congratulated the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure CDRI for the initiative and said for him the CDRI or IRIS is not just about infrastructure but it is part of a very sensitive responsibility of human welfare. “It is the collective responsibility of all of us towards mankind,” he said. “It is, in a way, a shared atonement for our sins.” “The last few decades have proved that no one is untouched by the wrath of climate change. Whether they are developed countries or countries rich in natural resources, this is a big threat to everyone,” Modi said.Stating that the Small Island Developing States or SIDS face the biggest threat from climate change, Modi said India’s space agency ISRO will build a special data window for them to provide them timely information about cyclones, coral-reef monitoring, coast-line monitoring etc. through satellite.Speaking on the occasion, British Prime Minister Johnson said that it’s incredibly cruel that vulnerable, small island states are right in the frontline of loss and damage that is caused by global warming.“They have done virtually nothing to cause the problem, they didn’t produce the huge volumes of CO2 to be pumped into the atmosphere,” he said.Johnson said that the UK is contributing financially to the initiative IRIS. “We are stomping up as well.” Australian Prime Minister thanked India and the UK for their leadership of the CDRI. “I acknowledge them the Quad support, including the US and Japan support for India’s CDRI,” he said.The IRIS initiative is a part of the Coalition for Disaster Resilient infrastructure that would focus on building capacity, having pilot projects, especially in small island developing states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cop26-pm-modi-launches-infrastructure-for-resilient-island-states-for-most-vulnerable-countries-101635878748154.html
03-11-2021||India||22 states, UTs reopen schools; 92% teachers vaccinated: Centre||As many as 22 states and Union territories have reopened schools for all students, with over 92% of the teaching staff across the country vaccinated against Covid-19, the Centre said on Tuesday.Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan, who reviewed the reopening of schools and vaccination status of staff, called for restoring normalcy in educational institutions. “Reviewed the vaccination progress of teaching and non-teaching personnel of schools, institutions and skill centres associated with the education and skilling ecosystem. With rapid vaccination at-scale in the country, we are looking at a future with restored normalcy and vibrancy in our schools and other educational and skilling institutions,” he posted on Twitter. As per shared by the education ministry, while over 92% teaching staff were vaccinated across the country, the central government-run institutions recorded 96% vaccination among their teaching staff. Over 86% of non-teaching staff engaged in schools across the country have also been vaccinated, officials aware of the developments said. The ministry data also showed that 22 states/UTs, including Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Kerala and Assam, have reopened schools for classes 1st to 12th. Six states and UTs, including Jammu and Kashmir, Odisha, Arunachal Pradesh, Goa, and Puducherry, have reopened schools for classes 9th to 12th. Similarly, six states/UTs, including Ladakh, Gujarat, Punjab, Nagaland and Jharkhand, have reopened schools for students enrolled in classes 6th to 12th. Only West Bengal and Manipur are yet to reopen schools, the ministry data showed. While West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee last week announced that schools will reopen for classes 9 to 12 from November 16, Manipur is yet to take a call on the matter. With schools remaining shut since March 2020, the Centre had allowed state governments to decide on their reopening keeping in mind the Covid-19 situation, in October last year. While several states had partially resumed physical classes, there was a complete closure again in April this year after a second wave of the disease hit the country.With an improvement in the Covid-19 situation in August this year, several states began reopening schools even as concerns were raised over the staff and teachers not being completely vaccinated.As part of the exercise, the Centre had directed states to document the vaccination status of teachers and non-teaching staff from secretaries of the school education department. On October 22, when India achieved its landmark 1 billion vaccinations, the education ministry had sought a tentative timeline from central universities on achieving 100% vaccination coverage of their students and staff.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/22-states-uts-reopen-schools-92-teachers-vaccinatedcentre-101635878688264.html
03-11-2021||India||Bengal bypolls: Unprecedented victory for TMC on 4 seats||Unprecedented margins of victory, running into around 150,000 votes in two assembly constituencies having 230,000 and 290,000 voters, and comfortable wins in two others marked the Trinamool Congress’ triumph over the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the by-polls held on October 30 to four assembly seats in West Bengal.The BJP, which won the Dinhata seat by 57 votes and Santipur, by 15878 votes in the March-April election, lost the seats by 164089 and 64675 votes respectively. Polls in these constituencies had to be held because the winners, Nisith Pramanik and Jagannath Sarkar, decided to retain their Lok Sabha seats instead after the BJP lost the state elections comprehensively.At Khardah and Gosaba, where polls had to be held as the TMC’s winning candidates died, the BJP lost by 93832 and 143051 votes respectively.The BJP candidates in Gosaba, Dinhata and Khardah lost their deposits.A TMC leader claimed the margins in the state polls were the highest ever. “The margins in Dinhata and Gosaba are the highest recorded in Bengal assembly polls. When three candidates of a party ruling at the centre lose their deposit, it proves all other parties (other than the ruling TMC) have lost their relevance in the state,” said Saugata Roy, an MP from the TMC.At all four seats, which are located in districts along the Bangladesh border, the BJP sought to make the attack on Hindus during Durga puja in the neighbouring country an issue.Cooch Behar district’s Dinhata is in the north Bengal region where the BJP defeated the TMC in most of the seats in both 2019 Lok Sabha and the March-April state polls.Though the BJP wrested 77 seats in the March-April polls, its tally in the assembly effectively came down to 70 on Tuesday; five BJP legislators have joined the TMC since June although they have not resigned from their party. The ruling party, on the other hand, has won 217 of Bengal’s 294 seats.Top state BJP leaders argued on Tuesday that voters faced intimidation and its workers were not allowed to campaign although more than 90 companies of Central armed police forces were deployed in Bengal by the Election Commission. The turnout on October 30 was around 65%.After the win, Mamata Banerjee tweeted: “This victory is people’s victory, as it shows how Bengal will always choose development and unity over propaganda and hate politics. With people’s blessings, we promise to continue taking Bengal to greater heights!”“At Dinhata and Gosaba, where the margins are exceptionally high, we were not allowed to hold meetings. If the trend continues, we will see similar results in the future. Terror holds the key in Bengal,” BJP national vice-president Dilip Ghosh, who was the party’s state president till September, said, indirectly referring to the coming civic body elections.The victory came days after Mamata Banerjee and her nephew, TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee, toured Goa and Tripura respectively to challenge the BJP in those states in the coming assembly polls. TMC leaders interpreted this as people’s desire to see the 66-year-old chief minister as face of the opposition against Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.“A cracker-free Diwali in true sense. Wishing folks at @BJP4India a very Happy Diwali!” tweeted Abhishek Banerjee.“We knew we would win all four seats but the scale of the victory projects Mamata Banerjee as the only face against the BJP in India,” said minister and TMC secretary general Partha Chatterjee.Six months ago, the Dinhata seat was won by MP Nisith Pramanik who was made Union minister of state for home affairs in July. Scrutiny of Tuesday’s results showed that BJP received only 97 of around 800 votes at the polling booth in Pramanik’s own neighbourhood where he cast his vote on October 30.“The results have proved that Pramanik is nothing but a paper tiger,” said TMC’s Udayan Guha who defeated Ashok Mondal, a former Forward Bloc leader, at Dinhata.For the Congress, which, like the Left parties, has no assembly seat in Bengal for the first time since Independence, the results brought more bad news.The vote share of the Congress at Santipur, the only seat it contested, was 0.37%. The national party got less votes than NOTA which accounted for 1.07 % of the votes polled in all four seats and the Revolutionary Socialist Party, one of the Left Front partners, which secured 0.4 % at Gosaba, the only seat it contested .“Our organisation has become extremely weak. We have faced repeated attacks during panchayat and assembly polls,” said state Congress president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury who has repeatedly accused the chief minister of helping the BJP by poaching Congress leaders in Goa and Tripura and posing a challenge to Sonia Gandhi.“The BJP has not done well even in most of the other states where bypolls where held. It was anticipated that TMC might win all four seats since ruling parties are always in an advantageous position in bypolls. What is significant is the speed at which the BJP’s vote share is depleting in Bengal,” said Kolkata-based political science professor Udayan Bandopadhyay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-bypolls-unprecedented-victory-for-tmc-on-4-seats-101635878569337.html
03-11-2021||India||Narendra Modi, Boris Johnson vow to rein in extremism||Glasgow: Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his British counterpart discussed issues pertaining to counter-terrorism and the need to rein in extremist activities by certain fringe separatist outfits, during the “short” bilateral exchange on the margins of the COP26 climate summit here.Addressing the media at the close of day one of the World Leaders’ Summit of the 26th Conference of Parties (COP26) at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on Monday night, foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said, “The meeting was short, but it did allow short exchanges on concerns that both our countries have on increasing radicalism.” Shringla was responding to a question on whether anti-Indian activities by separatist groups that organise pro-Khalistani activities in the United Kingdom (UK) were among the issues discussed between Modi and Johnson.“In many senses, the extremism that we are seeing in certain fringe groups seems to be speaking out on issues that they have no legitimate right to do so and without traction of any kind. But nonetheless, it’s causing a certain level of disequilibrium and concern in both our countries,” Shringla said.“Prime Minister Johnson felt fully that some of these groups need to be reined in and that clearly, steps have to be taken to see how such activity, which under no means is democratic or constitutional, could be addressed,” the foreign secretary added.He also reviewed the developments of the World Leaders’ Summit, during which PM Modi made a “seminal statement” on India’s contribution towards climate action by unveiling its National Determined Contributions (NBC) of setting a “realistic, responsible and ambitious” goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2070.“As the Prime Minister has said, climate change for him is an article of faith and India is more than fulfilling its commitments,” Shringla said.When asked if the extradition of high-profile economic offenders such as Vijay Mallya and Nirav Modi, who are wanted in India on charges of fraud and money laundering, was discussed, Shringla said the subject was not specifically discussed at length during the short bilateral meeting, adding that the National Security Advisers (NSAs) of both countries are due to deliberate on the issue at length at an upcoming meeting on Wednesday.“The issue of extradition is important and the two Prime Ministers agreed that the specifics of this issue will be discussed between our National Security Advisers who are going to meet in London on 3rd November. So, they would go into detail of consular, security and other aspects of the UK-India relationship,” the Foreign Secretary said.Meanwhile, a readout of the Johnson-Modi bilateral exchange was issued by 10 Downing Street, which said the meeting highlighted the growing strength of the wider UK-India relationship.“The Prime Minister (Johnson) highlighted India’s leadership on climate change and they discussed ways to work together on global approaches, including scaling affordable green technology. Prime Minister Modi welcomed the new UK India Green Guarantee to unlock World Bank funding,” according to the readout.The Green Guarantee is set to add GBP 750 million for green projects across India, announced by the UK at the COP26 summit and welcomed by India as a welcome initiative that can help towards the country’s climate action goals.“The leaders also discussed recent talks on a potential UK-India free trade deal, and the Prime Minister (Johnson) reiterated the UK’s commitment to deepening trade, investment and business ties between our two countries,” Downing Street noted.Further strengthening cooperation on bilateral defence and security and on international issues, including the situation in Afghanistan, were also among the topics of discussion flagged from the latest India-UK exchange on the sidelines of the World Leaders’ Summit – which concludes on Tuesday.(With Agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/boris-johnson-modi-agreed-on-need-to-rein-in-fringe-anti-india-extremist-groups-shringla-101635878514908.html
03-11-2021||India||J&K school principal, jail official sacked over ‘terror links’||A senior prisons officer and a government school principal on Tuesday were sacked by the Jammu and Kashmir administration for “actively working with terror outfits”, officials familiar with the matter said.Feroz Ahmad Lone, deputy superintendent of jails, J&K Prison Department, and Javid Ahmad Shah, principal of Government Girls Higher Secondary School at Bijbehara, were dismissed from services, on the orders of Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha, after an investigation by a government task force established their terror links, they said.A high-level meeting was held between senior officials at Raj Bhavan on Tuesday, following which the duo were removed under Article 311 of the Constitution, under which no inquiry is conducted before sacking, the officials cited above said on condition of anonymity.“The Lieutenant Governor is satisfied after considering the facts and circumstances of the case and on the basis of the information available that the activities of Mr. Feroz Ahmad Lone, Deputy Superintendent Jail S/o Abdul Gaffar Lone R/o Futlipora, Chari Sharef are such as to warrant his dismissal from service,” an order issued by the administration said.“The Lieutenant Governor is satisfied under sub-clause (c) of the proviso to clause (2) of Article 311 of the Constitution of India that in the interest of the security of the State, it is not expedient to hold an enquiry in the case of Mr. Feroz Ahmad Lone, Deputy Superintendent Jail S/o Abdul Gaffar Lone R/o Futlipora , Chrari Sharief , Budgam,” it added.A similar termination order was issued in the name of Shah, a resident of Eidgah Bijbehara in Anantnag.Lone, who was appointed in the government service in 2012, allegedly shares links with former Hizbul Mujahideen operational chief, Riyaz Naikoo, who was killed in an encounter with security forces in Pulwama last year, officials said.Lone is also accused of hatching a conspiracy with terrorist commanders to send Kashmiri youth illegally to Pakistan or Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir for weapons training and later bring them back to the Valley for terror acts, they added.“It is learnt that Lone was working for Riyaz Naikoo, the killed Hibzul Mujahideen terrorist. Investigation revealed that two persons from Pulwama district, Danish Ghulam Lone and Sohail Ahmad Bhat, were recruited and asked by Riyaz Naikoo to meet another terrorist Ishaq Palla,” one of the officials cited above said.Shah, on the other hand, was appointed as lecturer in the J&K education department in1989. He was posted as principal of Government Girls Higher Secondary School, Bijbehara. Shah is believed to be a sympathiser of Hurriyat and Jamat-e-Islami (JeI), another official said.“He played the role of an advisor to Hurriyat cadre and JeI working in Bijbehara in 2016 during an agitation against Hizbul Mujahideen leader Burhan Wani. As the principal of a government institution, he ensured that Hurriyat hartal calendars were followed in letter and spirit not only in the government school which he was heading but its subsidiary institutions too,” the first official said.More than a dozen employees and officers have been sacked by the administration in the past one year over alleged links with terrorists. In April, the L-G had set up a special task force to scrutinise and recommend cases for removal from government services, for alleged terror links, under Article 311(2)(c) of the Constitution. Last month, the government terminated the services of Anees-us-Islam, grandson of separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani, who was working as a research officer at the Sher-e-Kashmir International Convention Centre. Two sons of Hizbul chief Syed Salahuddin were also sacked along with 11 government employees in July this year. The dismissal of employees had earlier attracted sharp criticism from mainstream political parties and employees unions, who alleged that the sackings were carried out on “flimsy grounds”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jk-school-principal-jail-official-sacked-over-terror-links-101635878509636.html
03-11-2021||India||Experts praise India’s ‘bold’ net zero emission pledge at COP26||What does India’s announcement of transitioning to net zero emissions by 2070 mean?After all, it isn’t easy for an emerging economy with extremely low per capita emissions (and low per capita incomes), to declare its intent to decarbonize, however gradual the process may be.And what does this deadline mean for when the country’s emissions will peak?The timing of when individual countries’ emissions peak and then decline—especially those of major emitters like the United States and China—is critically important in determining whether the most dangerous climate impacts can be avoided.And how significant is India’s announcement?In the wake of India’s announcements -- enhancing its non-fossil fuel power capacity to 500 gigawatts (GW) by the end of the decade, up from 450GW; getting half of its energy from renewable sources by 2030; reducing carbon dioxide emissions per unit of gross domestic product by 45%; and cutting carbon-dioxide emissions by 1 billion tons from the business-as-usual scenario by 2030 -- HT spoke to experts on the ramifications.Vaibhav Chaturvedi, Fellow, CEEWIndia’s pledge is very significant. This is an unprecedented bold announcement from the Prime Minister. This is more ambitious than either the EU and Chinese announcements. For an economy that is expected to grow fast for the next two decades, even peaking in the next 20 years is not an easy feat.Realistically speaking India should peak by 2040-2045. It takes a pretty long time to change our energy systems. I think 30 years is a reasonable time. So, there will be a lot of growth in the near term. We are trying to clarify with the government if it’s talking about meeting 50% of India’s energy requirements from renewable energy by 2030. It’s not possible. Then you are referring to all sectors. I think they are referring to 50% installed capacity for electricity from renewable energy.This announcement will shake Indian and global energy markets and give a sense of much needed long-term certainty to the investors in the energy domain. The enhanced ambition of 2030 targets make the net-zero announcement even more credible. The Prime Minister has stamped India’s leadership in the climate discourse. Any ambitious target would have its share of challenges. The biggest near-term challenge is in electricity market design and distribution sector reforms. For the longer term, it would be managing the human resources in the coal sector. Skilled human resources for the new shape of energy markets would be critical. So, challenges galore, but strategic planning would help see us through.Professor Lord Stern of Brentford, Chair of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science (said in a statement)This was a very significant moment for the summit, with Prime Minister Modi pledging stronger action by India on climate change, with five new targets. These include a further increase in clean energy to 500 gigawatts by 2030, a reduction in emissions intensity of its economy by 45% by 2030, and net zero emissions by 2070. Together this might mean that India’s annual emissions of greenhouse gases could peak by 2030.This demonstrates real leadership, based on a track record of action and ambitious targets, that can deliver on both economic development and climate change, from a country whose emissions per capita are about one-third of the global average. The rich world must respond to Prime Minister Modi’s challenge to deliver a strong increase in international climate finance.Sandeep Pai, research lead at Center for Strategic and International StudiesIndia’s net zero pledge is bold. For a developing country which has not even carbonized to talk about decarbonization is ambitious and sets the targets clearly. However, devil will be in the details or in other words what would be the exact plans to achieve this target. In the absence of these plans, this pledge will not mean much. By when India will have to peak to meet the pledge will really depend on the sectoral pathway the country will follow. For example, when will the coal use peak in the power sector?” he said adding that “India’s 2030 targets are achievable but not easy at all. From DISCOM reforms, raising large-scale finance for deployment of renewables, managing land issues, to aligning centre-state climate policies will be key determinants of whether India will be able meet its 2030 targets or not.Sunita Narain, director general of Centre for Science and Environment.Our analysis shows that India’s pledge at Glasgow is achievable. If we just look at Central Electricity Authority’s projections, it shows we are on track. India’s power requirement in 2030 is projected to be 2518 BU and if we target to meet 50% of our requirements from renewables, then the installed capacity will have to increase from the planned 450 GW to 700 GW. If we consider hydroelectricity as part of renewables – as it is considered globally – then we will need to increase new renewable capacity to 630 GW. This is achievable. The issue of net zero emissions is anyway inequitable. If it were to be equitable developed (OECD) countries should have a target of net zero by 2030, China by 2040 and India and rest of the world by 2050.Apurba Mitra, Chirag Gajjar and Ulka Kelkar, climate experts at World Resources Institute (in a statement)Net zero and possible target years for India have been hotly debated in the country over the last year. If today’s announcement refers to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, it would be very ambitious and more than India’s fair contribution to global efforts to stay within 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming. It would require countering emissions from agriculture and land use, not just emissions from energy and industrial processes.If it refers to net-zero carbon dioxide emissions, it would still send a strong long-term signal to all sectors of the economy and be compatible with 2 degrees Celsius of global warming. Taken together with the other short-term targets for massive capacity growth in renewable energy, India’s net-zero target will provide regulatory certainty to industry to invest in deep decarbonization, and to India’s growing cities and states to plan net-zero pathways to development..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/experts-praise-india-s-bold-net-zero-emission-pledge-at-cop26-101635878208026.html
03-11-2021||India||How ‘caste bias’ in Bikaner college snuffed out a family’s hope||It’s been nearly two months since Prem Devi cooked for her family. Every time someone walks in, she retreats deeper into the shadows. People try to talk to her, but she pulls her red bandhani saree over the face and turns away. Outside, visitors arrive and talk loudly, but indoors Devi collapses into stifled sobs. Only one sentence comes back to her again and again.“He is gone,” she whispers – pointing towards the kitchen where she would make bathua and besan barfis every time her son, 20-year-old Pradeep Meghwal, came home from his college in Bikaner. “It was his favourite,” she says. “And I will never make it for him again.”Pradeep took his life on September 22 after months of alleged caste-based harassment from dominant-caste batchmates and apparent inaction by college authorities in Bikaner. Devi now wonders whether she was wrong to send him to a big city. “I should have stopped him from going back there,” she said. “But I didn’t know what he was going through.”Pradeep’s ordeal mirrors the experiences of many students from marginalised castes and tribes, who battle harassment and bullying in institutions from their higher-caste peers but find it difficult to access redressal. It is also recalls the 2019 suicide of Payal Tadvi, who killed herself after months of casteist abuse and harassment in a Maharashtra medical college in a case that shook the education fraternity.Hope of the familyLocated at the edge of Rajasthan’s desert belt, Karkedi is ringed by dunes of sand. Scrubs and small patches of vegetation dot the landscape, and a dirt road veers off the state highway into the village of 300 households, of which around 45 are Dalits. Farm plots are small, yet many villagers are engaged in agriculture. Young men often make their way to nearby towns of Losal, Kuchaman or Sikar for construction and other temporary labour jobs.Pradeep was the opportunity for his family to climb out of this destitution. The shy boy passed his Class 12 examinations with 82% marks from the state board in 2018 – the first Dalit from the region to secure first division. “He was focused on getting into college; it was his dream to land a job,” said Bhanwar Meghwal, their next-door neighbour.He enrolled in the College of Agriculture in Bikaner in 2018 for the undergraduate honours degree in agriculture, records reviewed by HT show. For a while, everything was great. He passed exams with ease, made friends, and told his parents that he will look for a government job soon. “We wanted him to become an agriculture supervisor (an entry-level state government job that pays roughly R30,000 a month) but he had higher ambitions. He promised us that he will make us proud,” said his father, Omprakash.Every few weeks, Pradeep would leave the hostel and travel back to his village, roughly 250km away, for home-cooked food and time with his two brothers. But unbeknownst to the family, his caste was becoming a hurdle for him in college and pushing him into depression – a change noticed only by his mother. “He stopped eating his fill of rotis and his favourite tea. He became quieter,” said Devi. “But I didn’t know why.”HarassmentTrouble began six months ago, when Pradeep became close with a first-year female student from a so-called higher caste, said police officials aware of the matter and family members of the deceased. This incensed four other boys in the college – one was Pradeep’s batchmate and three others were juniors – all from the other backward class (OBC) community who shared the same caste, Jat, as the woman.“They took his phone and downloaded his conversation with the woman on WhatsApp, and then started blackmailing him. They asked him how he dared talk to a woman of a caste higher than his, and threatened to break his bones,” said Omprakash.On August 18, Pradeep returned home. His family was getting ready to celebrate because he had secured an internship at the local Krishi Vikas Kendra, a step closer to getting a government job.“But when he came, he was shaking like a leaf. He said the threats had escalated and they’d started referring to him by caste slurs in college and thrashed him,” said Ranjeet Meghwal, his elder brother.The men had entered his hostel room the day before he came to the village and told him that if the “low caste” didn’t stay in their bounds, his limbs would not be in a condition to earn him a living, stated the FIR later in Bikaner.That afternoon, when Omprakash was in the field, Ranjeet at the shop and Prem Devi resting in her room, Pradeep stepped out. He returned at night, collapsing on the courtyard. His brother rushed out, only to learn that he had consumed poison.The family took him to the local hospital, and returned with a recovering Pradeep three days later. Despite his protests, the family decided to lodge a complaint with the college authorities.The college set up a five-member disciplinary committee and on the basis of its report, issued an order on September 9, a copy of which is with HT.It put two students named by Pradeep – Ravindra Faroda and Gagan Ajit Singh – under probation and fined them ₹2,500 and ₹1,500 respectively and said the students were found “guilty of indiscipline and misconduct.”Importantly, Pradeep himself, along with two other students, was reprimanded. He was “strongly warned to not involve in any act of indiscipline in the future, failing which disciplinary action will be initiated”.The dean of the College of Agriculture, IP Singh, confirmed the probe and caste-based harassment to HT but added that the institution took adequate action.“The boy was involved with a girl who was his junior. There was a caste difference. He got into a fight with some other boys in the college who belonged to the caste of the girl. They threatened him to keep away from her,” said Singh.He said an inquiry was conducted after the family approached the college. “We took action and identified all the boys; we kept them on conduct probation and fined them.”But the family was livid. “If they knew that the boys were troubling them, why didn’t the college take strict action? Can R4.000 deter anyone?” asked Ranjeet.Final daysFive days later, on date, things came to a head.Pradeep had returned to the college for his term-ending examinations, as had the others. After one such exam, the four OBC men gathered in a common area and gave him an ultimatum; they also roughed him up, according to two friends of Pradeep who requested anonymity. Later that day, he tried to fling himself in front of a truck outside the college, confirmed his family and the college authorities.“The boys kept asking the woman why she continued to talk to “neech” (lower) men. Will you also talk to us, they asked,” stated the FIR, a copy of which is with HT.He was sent back home again. At home, he was a shadow of his former self – silent but restless, unable to sit down but also afraid of venturing out. His parents repeatedly implored him to stay back, or to tell them what’s wrong, but he refused. He was also missing his exams and after a couple of days at home, was itching to get back to college, said Ranjeet.They didn’t know how to help him, or how his mood could lift. They thought of going to doctors but knew no one in the hinterlands who could help Pradeep. They were sure if the caste bullying stopped, Pradeep would recover.They were wary of allowing him back to college. And yet, they knew they had no real choice. “He was missing his exams and his only big chance to make a career for himself,” said Ranjeet.He took a train back to Bikaner on September 22, promising to his family that he will come back after finishing his pending papers.That evening, at 7.36pm, Ranjeet saw his brother had changed his WhatsApp status and posted stories announcing his intent to take his life. For the next several minutes, he tried to frantically dial Pradeep but to no avail. “Reading his two-page note was heartbreaking where he described his feelings for the woman and the pain inflicted on his due to his caste by the men,” said Ranjeet.In the early hours of the morning, police informed the Meghwal family that Pradeep was found dead in the railway tracks behind the college. Their hope had been snuffed out.QuestionsWhy did the family let him return to Bikaner?This question has been gnawing at the Meghwals for about a month, and has been hurled at them by neighbours, authorities and the administration of the College of Agriculture.“His family shouldn’t have left him like this. He was mentally disturbed. He should have got treatment but instead family left him,” said IP Singh.Singh admits that higher-caste boys harassed Pradeep for months but insists the college did all it could. “The woman belonged to caste of the boys. Naturally, in inter-caste conflict, advice is given to the boy that keep away from our girl. We know our Indian society. Caste shackles are very big here,” he said. “The boy was not handsome, he was very ordinary looking. How the friendship with the girl happened; it is very surprising.”He said he even met Pradeep and spoke to him when the probe was conducted and advised him to “leave all this” and concentrate on studies. “We informed the family. Where could we have taken him? If he needed medical attention, I could have sent him to doctor. But he had suicidal tendencies,” he explained.The four men have been booked by police for abetment of suicide and under sections of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act that penalise public abuse and threats to a Dalit person. Two of them were arrested on Saturday.“We had no role in the death, it was a different matter. We didn’t even know him very well. He was depressed,” said Rajkumar Bijarniya, one of the accused. Another accused, Froda, declined to comment. A third accused, Gagan Ajit Singh, said that he didn’t want to be associated with such negativity. “Such things shouldn’t be made into issues,” he said.Pradeep’s family is wracked with guilt and anger. They never stopped Pradeep from going back because they knew how important passing an exam can be in an impoverished Dalit family. “My youngest brother and I dropped out of school and started working because we wanted to put Pradeep through college,” said Ranjeet.Both of them took shifts to work in the field and the shop to pay the roughly Rs1 lakh a year fees for his undergraduate degree. Neither Pradeep nor his family ever imagined that his dropping out of college was an option.There was another reason: Ignorance. “We simply didn’t know how badly he was being harassed. We thought it will go away after complaining with the college. We didn’t know how much he was suffering. We didn’t want to stand in the way of his dream,” said Omprakash.RegretLocal activists say the trajectory of the case is typical in a state with one of the worst investigation records for cases under the SC/ST Act – roughly one in two cases don’t reach the charge sheet stage, according to NCRB data for 2020. “Dalits are murdered, pushed to suicide, raped, stopped from riding horses in weddings or conducting last rites but authorities are not concerned unless protests erupt,” said Hariram Mehrada, chief of the Ambedkar Dalit Adhikar Manch in Rajasthan.Police said the investigation is ongoing. “We are collecting all the facts and recording statements,” said Bikaner circle officer Pawan Kumar, who is probing the case. Bichhwal station house officer Manoj Sharma said the two arrested men – Froda and Singh – have been sent to 14-days judicial custody.These days, the Meghwal household is always a hub of activity. Relatives drop by throughout the day. Activists walk in and out of the house, photocopying documents. Friends of Pradeep call to commiserate.But Prem Devi is unmoved. Her memory is stuck at the last time she saw her son, stepping out of the house. “He was leaving when he turned back, and said, everyone believes in me, but I don’t know if I can live up to their hopes. Why didn’t I tell him he didn’t need to?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-caste-bias-in-bikaner-college-snuffed-out-a-family-s-hope-101635878087324.html
03-11-2021||India||Fertiliser squeeze weighs heavy on rabi sowing||A global supply-chain squeeze and rising prices have hit the availability of fertilisers in the country, weighing heavily on the coming winter-sown or rabi farming season, as cultivators scramble for crop nutrients in states such as Punjab, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh. The Union government has set up a team to monitor supplies. Union minister for chemical and fertilisers Mansukh Mandaviya assessed the demand situation in key food-bowl states several times last week. He last reviewed the nation’s total fertiliser demand for November on Monday and denied any shortage. “I request farmers not to go by rumours and assure them that the government has made adequate arrangements for the supply of fertilisers,” the minister said in a taped statement.However, inventories of key crop nutrients, especially DAP (diammonium phosphate) and murate of potash (MPO), have a hit a five-year low, the managing director of one of India’s largest crop-nutrient firms said, requesting anonymity. A sharp increase in international prices, lower production of feedstock or raw materials during the peak pandemic phase, and shipping bottlenecks are key reasons for the crisis. According to the fertiliser minister, the government has made arrangements for supply of 1.8 million tonne of DAP against a total demand 1.7 million tonne for the country as a whole for November. The Union government is coordinating and monitoring shipments in over 50 ports and railway heads critical for supplies.On October 14, the Union government revamped parts of its subsidy regime for fertilisers and crop nutrients to continue providing them at below-market rates, while rolling over special discounts announced for the summer-sown season to the oncoming winter-sown months. International prices of raw materials for some crop nutrients such as DAP and 22 grades of phosphatic and potassic (P&K) fertilisers have been increasing for over 18 months, trade data show. Most of these fertilisers have seen a jump of over 50% in prices, forcing the government to expand subsidy. India offers subsidies to compensate fertiliser companies who sell them at below-market rates. The country imports up to a third of its fertilisers to meet domestic demand. China, the largest producer of DAP, is a key supplier of the nutrient to India. “Prices have gone through the roof and urea, for instance, is very, very expensive to buy. That is the main issue,” said KS Raju, chairman of the board at Nagarjuna Fertilizers and Chemicals, a large conglomerate. Although the government has announced additional subsidies under the so-called nutrient-based subsidy regime — the mechanism by which the Centre disburses the subsidy to manufacturers — worth ₹28,602 crore, manufacturers could be buying at a slower pace. “Since extra capital is required because of higher global rates, purchase deferment is taking place, adding to the shortage,” said Ashok Agrawal of Comtrade, a commodities trading firm. He said shipments, however, were expected to increase. Data show that India needs to ratchet up imports as stocks run low. During the summer-sown months, DAP demand outstripped availability by 13.6%, official data accessed by HT show. “Indigenous production of urea at 7.89 million tonne and DAP at 1.11 million tonne during April-July 2021 declined by 3.9% and 12.3%, respectively, over April-July 2020,” wrote Satish Chander, the director general of Fertiliser Association of India in the latest issue of the Indian Journal of Fertilisers. Rumours of a shortage have prompted farmers to panic and buy nutrients like DAP in excess quantities, said Amrik Singh, an official of the Punjab agriculture department.

The bypolls were necessitated after they chose not to take oath and continue as parliamentarians.The TMC has now added two more seats to its kitty, thereby having 215 of the 294 seats in the assembly.Vijayvargiya, who was in charge of the BJP during the West Bengal assembly elections 2021, said multiple “fake cases” are being lodged against his party leaders in West Bengal.Also Read | Abhishek Banerjee wishes BJP ‘happy Diwali’ after TMC’s greenwash of Bengal bypolls“There are almost 120 fake cases on BJP MP Arjun Singh, there are 20 cases against me too. Now, how can anyone survive when the government starts killing the opposition like this?” he said. The BJP leader further said the matter of winning and losing in elections emerges when they are held in a fair manner and not where “police, goons and political parties work in nexus for booth capturing”.“They (TMC) snatch seats by capturing polling booths,” he said.Vijayvargiya is not the only BJP leader, who has accused the TMC of snatching votes. Earlier in the day, party’s national vice-president Dilip Ghosh said West Bengal Police “get the voting done” and that elections there are “one-sided and not neutral”.“BJP candidates never get cars, mics, or accommodation during the by-elections here…Earlier, too, we lost the by-elections but won the general elections at the same place,” Ghosh, who was until recently BJP’s Bengal president, told ANI.Ever since the TMC regained power in West Bengal, several TMC turncoats like Rajib Banerjee, Mukul Roy and Sabyasachi Datta have switched sides. Many BJP leaders, including former Union cabinet minister Babul Supriyo, who had lashed out at the people of West Bengal for voting “cruel lady” back to power, have also joined the ruling party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-forcing-bjp-leaders-to-join-camp-slapping-fake-cases-kailash-vijayvargiya-101635877015817.html
03-11-2021||India||Oppn claws out gains; NDA sweeps Northeast||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) reaffirmed its dominance in Assam, and, along with its allies, the North-East; the Trinamool Congress (TMC) in West Bengal; and the Congress delivered a major upset in Himachal Pradesh, another upset in Karnataka, and held its own in Rajasthan when results were declared on Tuesday to by-elections in 29 assembly and three Lok Sabha constituencies across 14 states and a Union territory. In one seat, in Nagaland, the winner was declared uncontested on October 13.The results of the bypolls can’t be extrapolated to analyse possible outcomes of full-scale state and national elections, but they are, analysts say, usually a weathervane of sentiment.If that’s the case, the BJP has reason for cheer (Assam, Madhya Pradesh, North-East, and Telangana, where it won a hotly contested seat), and concern (Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka and Bengal).And while the Congress can feel encouraged by its performance in Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Karnataka (where it gave a black eye to the current chief minister BS Bommai by winning a seat in his home district), its performance in Assam was disappointing. There were sub plots as well – in Bihar, for instance, where the Janata Dal (United) put up a strong showing and the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), despite all its talk, didn’t; in Dadra and Nagar Haveli, where the Shiv Sena won its first Lok Sabha seat outside Maharashtra; and in Haryana, where Indian National Lok Dal’s (INLD) Abhay Chautala won back the seat he vacated to protest three controversial central farm laws.This is the last round of elections before high-stakes polls in five states, including Uttar Pradesh, scheduled early next year. In all, the BJP and its allies won 16 assembly seats and one Lok Sabha seat, the Congress won eight assembly seats and one Lok Sabha seat, and other Opposition parties won six assembly and one Lok Sabha seat.HIMACHAL PRADESHIn Himachal Pradesh, the opposition Congress swept the by-elections. It wrested the Mandi Lok Sabha constituency and Jubbal-Kotkhai assembly segment from the ruling BJP and retained the Arki and Fatehpur assembly seats. The state is scheduled to go the polls in November-December next year.The biggest upset was delivered in Mandi, where Pratibha Singh, the wife of former chief minister Virbhadra Singh, won by 7,490votes. In 2019, the BJP’s Ram Swaroop Sharmawon the seat by 450,000 votes.The victory was a setback for chief minister Jai Ram Thakur, for whom the election was a litmus test as the state heads into an election year. Mandi is considered Thakur’s home turf.ASSAM AND NORTH-EASTThe BJP and its allies delivered their best performance in the North-East, where they swept all 10 assembly seats in four states. In Assam, where by-elections were held in five seats, the ruling BJP won three and its partner United Peoples’ Party Liberal (UPPL) bagged the other two.“Today’s victory is both humbling and reassuring and we promise to continue the path of ‘vikas’ (progress) as per vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi… This further strengthens our resolve to continue delivering on good governance,” chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said.Two of the five seats, Tamulpur and Gossaigaon, fell vacant due to deaths of opposition Bodoland Peoples’ Front (BPF) and ruling UPPL legislators from Covid 19–related complications.The other three seats went to polls as two Congress MLAs, from Mariani and Thawra, and an All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) MLA from Bhabanipur switched to the BJP. All three turncoats, Sushanta Borgohain (Thawra), Rupjyoti Kurmi (Mariani) and Phanidhar Talukdar (Bhabanipur), secured easy wins on Tuesday.“We accept the people’s verdict with humility,” Assam Congress president Bhupen Kumar Borah said.In Meghalaya, ruling National Peoples’ Party (NPP) candidates won two of the three seats while ally, United Democratic Party (UDP), emerged the winner in the third. In Mizoram, ruling Mizo National Front (MNF) candidate K Laldawngliana won the lone bypoll and in Nagaland, the ruling Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party (NDPP) retained the Shamator-Chessore assembly constituency with its candidate S Keoshu Yimchunger declared elected uncontested.BENGALThe biggest margins of the day came from West Bengal, where the TMC won all seats that voted on Saturday, wresting two seats from opposition BJP.The BJP, which won the Dinhata seat by 57 votes and Santipur by 15,878 votes in the March-April elections, lost the seats by 160,000 votes and 64,675 votes respectively. Polls in these constituencies had to be held because the winners did not take oath as legislators to retain their Lok Sabha seats. The Dinhata seat, which was earlier won by Union minister of state for home Nisith Pramanik, delivered the biggest assembly poll margin in the state’s history.In Khardaha and Gosaba, where polls had to be held as the TMC’s winning candidates died, the state’s ruling party won by 93,832 and 140,000 votes, respectively.KARNATAKAIn Karnataka, chief minister Bommai suffered a setback as the Congress stole a victory in his home district in Hangal constituency. Srinivas Mane, the Congress candidate, won by 7373 votes.The BJP secured a resounding victory in Sindgi, defeating the Congress by over 30,000 votes. The seat was earlier held by the Janata Dal (Secular), which ran a coalition government with the Congress between 2018 and 2019.“Losing Hangal is a big statement for the BJP. There was more focus on Hangal from the government and all controversial statements came from this constituency,” A Narayana, political analyst and faculty at the Azim Premji University, said.TELANGANAIn Telangana, the BJP snatched the Huzurabad assembly seat from the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS). Former state health minister Eatala Rajender, who contested the by-elections on a BJP ticket, defeated TRS candidate Gellu Srinivas Yadav by 23,865 votes in a keenly fought battle.The by-election was necessitated due to the resignation of Rajender, who quit the TRS and joined the BJP in June this year. The by-election in Huzurabad was seen as a battle of egos between the CM and Rajender.“Had Rajender lost the by-election, it would have been a big question mark on his political career. By winning the seat, he not only proved his hold over the constituency but also improved the prospects of the BJP all over Telangana,” political analyst S Ramakrishna said.BIHARIn Bihar, the JD(U) retained both Kusheshwar Sthan and Tarapur assembly seats despite a high-voltage offensive by the RJD with the return of party chief Lalu Prasad on the campaign trail.JD(U) nominee Aman Bhushan Hazari defeated RJD’s Ganesh Bharti by 12,695 votes in Kusheshwar Sthan. At Tarapur, JD(U) candidate Rajeev Kumar Singh won by 3,821 votes. The election also saw growing bitterness between the RJD and the Congress, which contested the elections separately but couldn’t make an impact.OTHER RESULTSThe BJP gained in Madhya Pradesh by winning two seats- Jobat and Prithvipur -- both Congress bastions and retained the Lok Sabha seat of Khandwa in bypolls. The Congress won one seat, Raigaon, after a period of 32 years.In Rajasthan, the opposition BJP lost both assembly seats - Vallabhnagar and Dhariawad -- to Congress, and stood fourth and third, respectively.INLD’s Abhay Singh Chautala retained the Ellenabad seat by defeating his BJP rival, Gobind Kanda, by 6,739 votes. This is his fifth assembly victory from the rural Jat-dominated seat.For the first time since its inception in the 1960s, the Shiv Sena will have an MP from outside Maharashtra with the party nominee Kalaben Delkar, wife of independent MP late Mohan Delkar, winning the bypoll to the Dadra and Nagar Haveli Lok Sabha seat on Tuesday. She defeated her BJP rival Mahesh Gavit by 51,269 votes.The ruling YSR Congress retained the Badvel assembly seat in Kadapa district of Andhra Pradesh, securing a record margin of 90,533 votes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oppn-claws-out-gains-nda-sweeps-ne-101635877969192.html
03-11-2021||India||Former Maha home minister in ED custody||A Mumbai court on Tuesday remanded former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh to the Enforcement Directorate’s (ED) custody till November 6, a day after the central agency arrested the 72-year-old Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader in connection with a money-laundering case.Deshmukh was arrested by ED after about 12 hours of questioning in the case linked to an alleged extortion racket in the state police establishment. The NCP, part of Maharashtra’s ruling coalition Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), has said the allegations are politically motivated.A First Information Report (FIR) was registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) against Deshmukh in April to probe allegations that he asked suspended assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze, currently behind bars in relation to the February 25 Antilia bomb scare conspiracy as well as the murder of businessman Mansukh Hiran on March 5, to collect ₹100 crore every month from the hotels, bars and restaurants in Mumbai.The NCP leader appeared before ED for the first time on Monday after skipping multiple summons for the past five to six months. The central agency even issued a look-out notice against him as he was absconding all these months.On Tuesday, Deshmukh was produced for remand before additional sessions judge PB Jadhav, who presided over the special holiday court, a little after noon. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh, appearing for ED, sought 14-day custody of the NCP leader, saying his custodial interrogation was required to carry out further probe into the case, which stems from the CBI FIR.Shortly after conducting a medical examination at Sir JJ Hospital in south Mumbai, ED officials produced Deshmukh before the holiday court. Additional solicitor general Singh and Hiten Venegaonkar, who appeared for the agency, submitted that a comprehensive money trail needs to be established to bring the guilty to book, and, since Deshmukh has emerged as the main beneficiary, he is required to be interrogated in custody. In its application seeking Deshmukh’s remand, the agency said a foreign angle could not be ruled out.A money laundering case against Deshmukh was registered on May 11 on the basis of CBI’s FIR of April 21. The CBI FIR was, in turn, based on allegations of corruption levelled by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh.In a letter written to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on March 20, Singh alleged that Deshmukh directed certain Mumbai police officers to collect an amount of ₹100 crore every month from Mumbai’s bars and restaurants.ED’s lawyers pointed out that the agency’s probe revealed that, on Deshmukh’s instructions, Vaze called a meeting of bar owners, and that, between December 2020 and February 2021, collected ₹4.7 crore from the owners of so-called orchestra bars in Mumbai to avoid police interference. In his statement to ED, Vaze is said to have revealed that he handed over the “extorted money” in two instalments to Deshmukh’s aide Kundan Shinde.Subsequently, they said, Deshmukh’s son Hrishikesh received an amount of ₹4.18 crore routed through Delhi-based shell entities as donations to a Deshmukh-led charitable trust, Shri Sai Shikshan Sanstha, Nagpur.Deshmukh’s counsels, advocates Vikram Chaudhri and Aniket Nikam, maintained that the NCP leader’s arrest was illegal. They pointed out that the original complainant Singh himself fled the country and is wanted in several extortion cases, and Vaze, on whose statement the agency is relying, is under arrest for equally serious offences. They added that Deshmukh was in no way related to the controversy and that the investigation itself was mala fide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-maha-home-minister-in-ed-custody-101635877967281.html
03-11-2021||India||‘One Sun, One World One Grid’: PM Modi calls for global solar grid at COP26||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday launched the Green Grids Initiative—One Sun One World One Grid (GGI-OSOWOG), the first international network of global interconnected solar power grids, jointly with his UK counterpart Boris Johnson, at COP26 here.“One Sun, One World & One Grid will not only reduce storage needs but also enhance the viability of solar projects. This creative initiative will not only reduce carbon footprints and energy cost but also open a new avenue for cooperation between different countries and regions,” PM Modi said, while delivering his remarks at the ‘Accelerating Clean Technology Innovation and Deployment’ event at COP26.Modi and Johnson on Tuesday also released the One Sun declaration, which stated, “Realising the vision of One Sun One World One Grid through interconnected green grids can be transformational, enabling all of us to meet the targets of the Paris Agreement to prevent dangerous climate change…these efforts can stimulate green investments and create millions of good jobs. The declaration has been endorsed by 80 ISA member countries.”Modi said the only challenge with the OSOWOG initiative is that this energy is only available during the daytime and is dependent on the weather. “Solar energy is totally clean and sustainable. Challenge is that this energy is only available during the daytime and is dependent on the weather. ‘One Sun, One World & One Grid’ is the solution to this problem. Through a worldwide grid, clean energy can be transmitted to anywhere & anytime,” he said.PM Modi reiterated that the idea for the One Sun One World One Grid (OSOWOG) initiative was put forth by him at the First Assembly of the International Solar Alliance (ISA) in October 2018.PM Modi further expressed hope that a common and strong global grid can be developed through cooperation between countries on this initiative. “I am hopeful that a common and strong global grid can be developed through cooperation between ‘One Sun, One World & One Grid’ and ‘Green Grid’ initiatives. Indian space agency ISRO is going to provide a solar calculator application to the world.”The GGI-OSOWOG will bring together a global coalition of governments, international financial and technical organisations, legislators, power system operators and knowledge leaders to accelerate the construction of the new infrastructure needed for a world powered by clean energy, according to ISA.ISA also aims to mobilize US$1 trillion of funding by 2030 to assist developing countries in expanding their solar power grids to meet their energy needs. “The One Sun One World One Grid and Green Grids Initiative is an idea whose time has come. If the world has to move to a clean and green future, these interconnected transnational grids are going to be critical solutions,” PM Modi said during the launch.According to the One Sun declaration, the main areas of work of the initiative will be: investing in solar, wind, storage and other renewable energy generation in locations endowed with renewable resources for supporting a global grid; building long-distance cross-border transmission lines to connect renewable energy generators; developing and deploying cutting edge techniques and technologies to modernise power systems; supporting the global transition to zero emission vehicles through incorporating the role of electric vehicles to help improve grid flexibility; attracting investment into solar mini-grids and off-grid systems to help vulnerable communities gain access to clean, affordable, and reliable energy; developing innovative financial instruments, market structures for solar grid infrastructure.“We are assessing the readiness for Osowog which would mean connecting regional grids. The sun never goes down; when one side of the planet is dark there is light on the other side. For example, East Asia gets the first light of sun and it is also where the sun sets first but India still gets sunlight when its sunset in East Asia so electricity can flow from India (to East Asia) during those hours. Similarly, west Asia and Africa can supply electricity to India when it’s dark here. The concept offers an opportunity to use solar energy 24 hours a day. ISA is studying the viability of the concept through the World Bank and Électricité de France. They have already found that under certain circumstances this transfer can be economically viable,” Ajay Mathur, director general of International Solar Alliance had said during fourth general assembly of ISA in October.According to Climate Parliament, one of the partner organisations working on GGI-OSOWOG, the initiative aims to combine a massive increase in solar and wind power with international grids on every continent, connecting energy rich locations such as sunny deserts and windy coastlines. Combine large-scale solar power stations, wind farms and grids with rooftop solar and community grids, including village mini grids, to ensure a reliable, resilient, and affordable supply of clean energy for all.In May 2021, the United Kingdom and India agreed to combine forces of the Green Grids Initiative and the One Sun One World One Grid initiative and jointly launch GGI-OSOWOG at the COP26 summit being hosted by the UK at Glasgow in November 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/one-sun-one-world-one-grid-pm-modi-calls-for-global-solar-grid-at-cop26-101635877791812.html
03-11-2021||India||Congress bags 1 Lok Sabha, 3 assembly seats in BJP-ruled Himachal Pradesh||Shimla/Dharamshala: The opposition Congress swept the by-elections in the Mandi Lok Sabha constituency besides the Arki, Fatehpur and Jubbal-Kotkhai assembly segments by defeating the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Himachal Pradesh on Tuesday.The BJP was the incumbent in the parliamentary constituency and one of the assembly constituencies. Celebrations broke out in the Congress camp even before the Election Commission formally announced the results in the evening.Pratibha Singh, the Congress candidate and wife of former chief minister the late Virbhadra Singh won from Mandi parliamentary constituency by 7,490 votes. A former two-term member of Parliament from Mandi, Singh polled 3,69,565 votes, while her BJP rival Brigadier Khushal Chand Thakur (retd) received 3,62,075 votes.None of the above (NOTA) played spoilsport for the BJP, with 12,626 votes.In the 2019 general election, the BJP won the Mandi seat by more than 4.5 lakh votes. Its voteshare declined by 20.61 percentage points in two years. The party polled 48.14% votes as compared to 68.75% in the 2019 elections. The Congress vote share rose by 23.46 percentage points. In the last elections, it polled just 25.64% votes, while this time it got 49.14% of votes.The Mandi seat is significant as it is the home turf of chief minister Jai Ram Thakur for whom this election was a litmus test of his and his party’s popularity as the state heads into an election year. Assembly elections in Himachal are scheduled for late 2022. The win also establishes that Singh will carry forward the political legacy of Virbhadra Singh, a six-time chief minister who passed away in July. Their son, Vikramaditya Singh, actively campaigned for her in the by-election.Infighting costs BJP dear in FatehpurIn Fatehpur assembly segment, Bhawani Singh Pathania of the Congress won by 5,789 votes. Pathania polled 24,449 votes against the BJP’s Baldev Thakur.Former member of Parliament Rajan Sushant, who contested as an independent candidate, polled 12,927 votes, playing spoilsport for his former party, the BJP.The ruling party’s campaign was marred by infighting in Fatehpur, a stronghold of the Congress for more than a decade. The by-election was necessitated after sitting legislator Sujan Singh Pathania passed away due to a prolonged illness in February. His son, Bhawani, quit his job in a banking and insurance company to take the plunge into politics.Congress snatches Jubbal-Kotkhai from BJPThe Congress snatched the Jubbal-Kotkhai seat from the BJP. Congress nominee and a former two-term legislator, Rohit Thakur, defeated BJP rebel turned independent candidate Chetan Bragta by 6,293 votes. The BJP suffered a humiliating drubbing as its candidate, Neelam Saraik, couldn’t even save her security deposit.The death of BJP MLA and former minister Narinder Singh Bragta, Chetan Bragta’s father, necessitated the by-election.Thakur, the grandson of former chief minister Ram Lal Thakur, polled 29,955 votes, while Bragta got 23,662 votes. Saraik managed to get only 2,644 votes. The Congress also retained the Arki assembly seat that fell vacant after former CM Virbhadra Singh’s death in July. Congress candidate Sanjay Awasthi polled 30,798 votes against the 27,579 votes his BJP rival, Rattan Pal Singh, got. In Arki too, infighting harmed the BJP’s prospects, party leaders said.Chief Minister Jairam Thakur accepted the defeat and said the party will deliberate on the reasons for the loss. “We would take necessary steps to overcome shortcoming,” he said, admitting that there was sympathy for former CM Virbhadra Singh in the tribal regions and that the Congress took advantage of it.Himachal Congress president Kuldeep Singh Rathore said the election results are a referendum against the ruling BJP Government and sought the CM’s resignation.

03-11-2021||India||HT THIS DAY: November 3, 2000 — Direct-to-home TV okayed||New Delhi- PHEW! Nearly three years after well-heeled Indian television viewers were tantalised by the prospect of unrestricted access to hundreds of global channels, the Union Cabinet today finally cleared Direct-to-Home (DTH) broadcasting.DTH service obviates the need for your friendly neighbourhood cable operator. What you get will be what you pay for. For an investment of around ₹12,000 on a decoder and a pizza-sized dish antenna, a DTH subscriber will be able to receive global channels.The Centre has, however, built in safeguards against the creation of broadcasting monopolies, compromise of national security and distortion of public taste.There is to be a 49 per cent cap on foreign equity in DTH service providers. Of this, up to 20 per cent is to be foreign direct investment and the rest is to be foreign institutional investors, overseas corporate bodies and non-resident Indian investments.Briefing reporters after the Cabinet meeting, Information and Broadcasting Minister Sushma Swaraj said DTH was the first major step towards convergence but extra caution had been taken to ensure that no vertical monopolies were created.“For security reasons, DTH players will have to beam from the home soil through earth stations within the country. They will also have to adhere strictly to the advertisement and programme codes laid down by the Ministry,” she said.For similar reasons, the chief executive officer and a majority of directors of DTH companies would have to be resident Indian citizens.Mrs Swaraj said to obviate creation of monopolies, the share of existing broadcasting companies and cable network owners would be restricted to 20 per cent in the DTH ventures. The new companies will also have to keep the I&B Ministry informed about any changes in the equity pattern.There will be no restriction on the number of DTH licenses to be issued by the I&B Ministry for a 10-year period. While companies will have to furnish an initial deposit of ₹10 crore, they will have to pay ₹40 crore as bank guarantee for the 10-year license period. At least 10 per cent of the total revenue generated will have to be shared with the Government. In case of violation of rules, apart from the threat of revocation of the license, the errant companies will have to shell out penalty to the tune of ₹50 crore. They will be required to preserve for at least 90 days, recordings of all programmes to be able to make those available for Government scrutiny. Mrs Swaraj said Doordarshan could also provide DTH service but the final decision in the matter rested with Prasar Bharati. Companies keen on using the technology for other services like fax and internet will have to obtain separate licenses. DTH service providers will have to show Doordarshan channels on the must-carry mode.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htthisday-november-3-2011-union-cabinet-okays-dth-tv-okayed-101635871487595.html
03-11-2021||India||Mapping a clean-air October in Delhi, and what could lie ahead...||Indians, especially in the northern plains, have so far been spared the toxic air they usually breathe with the end of the monsoon. The windfall of a delayed pollution season is not the result of proactive steps to control pollution. It was mostly delayed rainfall and farm fires, the latter also a result of delayed paddy procurement. None of these factors means that this year will not see a spike in pollution levels. In fact, there is enough data to show that pollution levels and factors that contribute to it are already seeing a spike.October 2021 air was better than October 2020 in most statesIn terms of concentration of PM 2.5, October 2021 was a better air-quality month than October 2020 in most Indian states. This is especially the case for northern India. If one were to look air quality in Delhi, Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, the region most infamous for farm-fire driven spike in pollution levels, October was at least 25% cleaner than what it was last year. To be sure, some states in the eastern and southern region did see a rise in pollution levels. However, it needs to be kept in mind that air-quality in southern and eastern states is generally much better than what it is in the northern plains. For example, Odisha saw the highest increase in PM 2.5 concentration between October 2021 and October 2020. However, its average PM 2.5 level in October 2021 was 37 microgram per cubic metre, much lower than Delhi, where PM 2.5 levels declined by 43% between October 2021 and October 2020, but were still at an average of 72 microgram per cubic metre.Rainfall and temperature responsible for clean air in OctoberEven if emission of pollutants doesn’t decrease, the weather can improve air quality. This may be because of rainfall, which washes away pollutants; or a higher temperature or windy conditions, which prevent accumulation of pollutants close to the ground. A combination of these factors helped in improvement of air quality this October in the northern states. Of the six states where air quality has worsened, in four – Assam, Maharashtra, Odisha, and Telangana – October 2021 rainfall is 29% to 65% less than October 2020. In West Bengal and Kerala, where rainfall was more and farm fires aren’t a big issue, maximum temperatures have decreased, and perhaps aided the worsening of air quality.But pollution levels have been rising since the last week of OctoberAs the factors which led to pollution levels being lower than last year dissipate – rains have stopped, temperatures have started falling and farm fires have increased – air quality is already deteriorating in the northern plains. In the last three days of October, air quality has gradually moved closer to the levels in October 2020.With a rise in farm fires, this is only expected to get worseFor most of October, fires in Punjab and Haryana, as observed by satellites, were lower than the number observed at this time of the year in the past. The sum of such fires in the two states from October 1 to October 30 was 14,822. This is the lowest number of fires since 2012, the earliest year for which the data is available from the Suomi-NPP satellite. The only year in the last 10 years with when the number of fires was not in the 20,000-30,000 range is 2018, when 18,512 fires were observed in the first 30 days of October. This situation changed dramatically on October 31. There were 3,140 such fires on the day, still only 7th highest in the last 10 years but comparable to the number of fires observed every year on the day.Pollution data is not as representative as rainfall or temperature dataHT has been using the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) gridded databases to analyse rainfall and temperature patterns in India. When it comes to pollution, the analysis unfortunately cannot be as comprehensive as temperature and rainfall. This is because availability of pollution data is contingent on functioning monitoring stations over a longer term. Unfortunately, there are still very few of them in India.There are currently 312 stations spread over 156 cities. Just 19 cities account for half of these stations and three alone -- Delhi (40 stations), Mumbai (21 stations), and Bengaluru (10 stations) -- account for nearly a quarter of these stations. Not all of these stations have worked consistently. This is a big problem in looking at long-term pollution levels. The analysis given here has used data from just 185 stations across 109 cities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mapping-a-clean-air-october-in-delhi-and-what-could-lie-ahead-101635870107313.html
03-11-2021||India||Shiv Sena’s jibe at PM Modi over G20 Summit||MUMBAI: The Shiv Sena on Tuesday took potshots at prime minister Narendra Modi for not wearing a mask during his visit to Rome, Italy for the G20 Summit and while meeting other heads of state. An editorial in party mouthpiece Saamana said that because Modi did not wear a mask during his foreign visit, the pace of immunization against Covid-19 in the country dropped.“Except Modi, all the leaders of the countries wore masks during the G20 summit. Modi was the only one roaming in this manner. He did not wear a mask when he met [US president] Joe Biden and French president [Emmanuel Macron]. This has led to a lot of criticism, but for ‘bhakts’, Modi is a ‘super power’. So he is not afraid of germs and viruses. Modi has shown the world to live without masks,” the editorial said.On the sidelines of the summit, Modi and other world leaders visited Trevi fountain on Sunday. The delegation also threw a coin over their shoulder in the fountain. It is believed that if you throw a coin over your shoulder into the water of the fountain, you will be sure to return to Rome.“Like Trevi fountain, there are many such fountains and spots in India. Even if this is superstition, Modi went there and put a coin in the water. What must he have wished for?

In further impetus to Atmanirbhar Bharat (Self-reliant India campaign), a global procurement of naval guns has been foreclosed with the quantity added to the upgraded SRGMs manufactured by BHEL,” the ministry said in a statement.The statement refers to an earlier plan of the Indian Navy to buy the Mk 45 gun system from the US --- it has now been shelved. In November 2019, the US cleared the sale of 13 Mk 45 anti-surface and anti-air naval gun systems, along with ammunition and related add-ons, to India for an estimated cost of $1 billion. The gun systems are made by BAE Systems. “The SRGM was earlier to be imported from the US. But now this project will be given to BHEL to give a push to the Make-in-India drive. This will help save ₹3,000 crore,” an official said.The government has taken several measures to boost self-reliance in the defence sector over the last two years. These include raising foreign direct investment (FDI) in defence manufacturing, creating a separate budget for buying locally made military hardware and notifying two lists of 209 defence items that cannot be imported in bans that will be progressively enforced from 2021 to 2025.These items include airborne early warning and control systems, light combat aircraft, missile destroyers, ship-borne cruise missiles, long-range land attack cruise missiles, basic trainer aircraft, specified types of helicopters, and artillery guns.Former army vice chief Lieutenant General AS Lamba (retd) said the indigenisation drive was finally coming of age with the government’s comprehensive approach towards self-reliance in the defence sector.“We are now seeing a new trend wherein the Indian industry is making complete weapons and systems in the country, in contrast to the past when indigenisation was limited to components and sub-systems,” Lamba added.LUH is an important project as it will eventually replace the army and the air force’s ageing fleets of Cheetah and Chetak helicopters whose safety record has been blemished by a string of crashes. Around 15 Cheetah and Chetak helicopters crashed during the last 10 years killing several pilots. Chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat, then a lieutenant general, survived a Cheetah crash in Dimapur on February 3, 2015.The LUHs cleared by DAC are six each for the army and air force. HAL expects the army and the air force to place combined orders for at least 187 light helicopters in the coming years -- 126 for the army and 61 for the air force. The design of the Cheetah and Chetak helicopters is more than 50 years old.HT reported on October 7 that after wrapping up rigorous flight testing of prototype helicopters in challenging conditions, HAL has set August 2022 as the deadline for carrying out the maiden test flight of the first chopper in the LUH limited series production.HAL is expected to deliver the first set of LUHs to the two services in two to three years of the signing of the contract. Subsequent orders will be executed at a faster pace as LUH production will also begin at HAL’s new helicopter factory in Tumakuru in Karnataka. The LUH’s first test flight will be carried out from the Tumakuru facility. The Bengaluru and Tumakuru facilities will be capable of rolling out 100 LUHs every year.The LUH has proved its capabilities in multiple rounds of trials in extreme conditions in the northern sector, Air Marshal Anil Chopra (retd), director-general, Centre for Air Power Studies, has previously said.India is also looking at jointly building with Russia the Kamov-226T light helicopters in the country. The Kamovs are also expected to replace the Cheetah and Chetak helicopters. However, the $1-billion programme, under which Russia will supply 60 helicopters in flyaway condition and the remaining 140 will be manufactured in India, is yet to kick off. The army, air force and navy together need around 500 light helicopters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/military-purchases-worth-7-965-crore-cleared-in-make-in-india-push-101635848254717.html
03-11-2021||India||2020 riots: Facebook representatives to appear before Delhi House committee||Facebook’s representatives will appear before the Delhi assembly’s peace and harmony committee in connection with the February 2020 riots in the national Capital even as the company has sought more time for it, the panel said on Tuesday. The committee has accordingly rescheduled its hearing to November 18.The panel last week issued a notice to the social media company, asking it to send by October 31 the names and designations of representatives, who will appear before it on November 2.In a statement, the panel said in response to its notice dated October 27, Facebook requested for a 14-day extension to ensure the availability of senior representatives, who are best placed to provide the ruling Aam Aadmi Party lawmaker Raghav Chadha-led committee with the required data. It added Facebook India’s public policy head made the request via an email on October 29.Also Read: ‘Step down and allow change’: Facebook whistleblower urges Mark ZuckerbergThe panel said considering the request and reasons stated therein, it decided to grant the extension to Facebook India to make available suitable senior representatives. It added in continuation of the panel’s previous proceedings, it called upon representatives of Facebook India to depose before the committee.In its response to the committee over email, which the panel shared with the press, Facebook said: “We will be happy to appear and offer our assistance to the committee... However, we respectfully request an extension of at least 14 days to appear before the committee in order to ensure the availability of senior representatives with the requisite knowledge and who are best placed to provide the committee with the data required.”A Facebook spokesperson confirmed the company has responded to the committee’s summons but did not comment further on the matter.The notice sent to Facebook on October 27, a copy of which HT has seen, said the failure in complying with it could lead to proceedings for breach of contempt/privilege of the assembly.The committee is examining the communal disharmony that led to the violence in Delhi last year and for recommending suitable measures to defuse the situation and restore harmony among communities. The violence left at least 53 people dead.The panel justified the notice citing the Supreme Court’s July 8 order upholding the powers of the panel to summon both members and non-members including representatives of Facebook.It told the Supreme Court in October 2020 that it summoned Facebook India vice-president and managing director, Ajit Mohan, as a witness to ascertain the social media platform’s views on whether it contributed in any way to the build-up of the February 2020 communal violence.The panel wants suggestions on how social media platforms could be used to strengthen unity among citizens. Facebook executives were summoned as witnesses, not as accused, an affidavit filed by Delhi deputy secretary Sadanand Sah said. Sah added no coercive action was intended.Mohan and Facebook moved Supreme Court on September 22 last year, challenging the panel’s notices. The summons stemmed from the committee’s decision to look into Facebook’s role following several foreign media reports that purported to show that the social media company may have acted in a politically partisan manner.Earlier this year, the assembly panel issued a fresh notice to Facebook India, asking that a “senior competent person” appear and testify before it.Mohan has previously questioned the jurisdiction of the panel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2020-riots-facebook-representatives-to-appear-before-delhi-house-committee-101635839013947.html
