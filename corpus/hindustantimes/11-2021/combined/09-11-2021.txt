UPPCL managing director Panjak Kumar has asked discoms to start installation of smart pre-paid meters of 4-G technology as per the Central government’s guidelines issued on September 7, 2021. “However, the EESL will ensure that the incidents like bulk disconnections do not reoccur due to any reason to avoid inconvenience to consumers,” he said. EESL, a Central government enterprise, is implementing the project that seeks to install 40 lakh smart meters in consumers’ residences in UP. The UPPCL in mid-October last year had suspended the project till October 31, 2021 after thousands of smart meter consumers were deprived of electricity when their meters got disconnected. Many other complaints about these meters were also received from time to time prompting the management to order inquiries. Meanwhile, Upbhokta Parishad chairman Awadhesh Kumar Verma said that there was no logic in re-starting the smart metering project without the taking action on the complaints received earlier. “We do not know the status of the inquiries even after one year of thousands of smart meter consumers having faced a lot of inconvenience due to disconnection of their meters,” he said. Verma demanded action against the officials who purchased smart meters based on an outdated 2-G technology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/uppcl-asks-discoms-to-resume-smart-metering-project-consumer-body-raises-questions-101636482068247.html
09-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi HC asks govt for details of liquor brands with fixed MRPs under new excise policy||The Delhi high court on Tuesday asked the Delhi government to disclose details about the number of liquor brands for which the maximum retail price (MRP) has been fixed and those yet to be done under the Delhi Excise Policy, 2021-22.Justice Rekha Palli, while hearing a plea by 16 retail liquor traders challenging the decision of the government to levy a licence fee from them from November 1, 2021, also asked the government whether registration of any liquor brand has already been done.The pleas, while seeking to postpone the collection of the licence fee till November 17, have contended that the MRPs have not yet been fixed for liquor brands and hence the licence fee cannot be charged by the Delhi government.“Before this issue is dealt with, I am of the view that it is necessary of the respondent (Delhi government) to inform the court about the number of brands for which the MRPs have been fixed and those which are left (to be fixed) along with dates. Also inform whether registration of any/ number of brands has already been done,” the court said.“This means people of Delhi will not get liquor. Why are you not fixing the MRP of brands?” the court further said.Senior advocate Maninder Singh, representing the liquor retailers, argued that the government cannot direct the petitioners to pay the licence fee with effect from November 1 as the payment of said fee depends on commencement of business. He said the authorities have not fixed the MRP for most liquor brands and hence have no right to direct retailers to pay the fee.One of the pleas filed by the 16 retailers, through advocates Tanmaya Mehta, Sanjay Abbot and Ankit Agarwal, said there has been a great delay in initiating the process of registration of brands and fixation of MRP by the Delhi government.It claimed that until October 30, not even a single brand had been registered within Delhi under the new excise policy, nor had the MRP been fixed for various liquor brands.It said the process for determination of MRP for retail sale is a time consuming exercise and if the scheduled date of commencement of business is November 17, as specified by the government, it is a complete breach of obligations on the part of the authorities in delaying the registration of brands and determination of MRP.This, however, was disputed by senior advocates Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Rahul Mehra, appearing for the Delhi government, who said the MRP of most of brands is already fixed and since the fixation of MRP is an ongoing process, the government was not responsible for any delay. They sought time from the court for taking instructions on the petition.The petitioners are successful bidders of L-7Z (zonal licence for retail vend of Indian liquor and foreign liquor) and L-7V (retail vend of Indian liquor, foreign liquor in a zone).The pleas also sought to restrain the government from demanding the sums of money in the form of licence fees or security deposit and also to direct the authorities not to levy or demand licence fees from successful bidders until the government performs its own obligations under the tender terms and conditions and the Delhi Excise Policy 2021-2022.The matter will next be heard on November 11.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hc-asks-govt-for-details-of-liquor-brands-with-fixed-mrps-under-new-excise-policy-101636481532515.html

The joint statement said the issues over disputes regarding Kotia group of villages, Neradi barrage, Jhanjavathi reservoir, Polavaram, the release of water for Bahuda river and mutual NOCs for the Balimela and Upper Sileru in the energy sector were discussed.“The chief secretaries of both the states will set up an institutional mechanism to deliberate on outstanding issues and find a solution that is in the best interest of the peopleof Odisha and Andhra Pradesh,” the joint statement said.Officials said among all the issues, the discussion on the construction of the Neradi barrage over Vamsadhara river took precedence as Odisha has filed clarification before the Vamsadhara Water Disputes Tribunal and Special Leave Petition (SLP) before Supreme Court objecting to the final orders of the water tribunal. In September this year, the Supreme Court sought a response from the Andhra Pradesh government after the Odisha government challenged the September 2017 orders of the tribunal allowing the Andhra Pradesh government to construct the Neradi barrage across the river with ancillary structures.With the SLP due for hearing in SC this month, Reddy had recently written to Patnaik seeking his cooperation in the construction of Neradi barrage by publishing the final orders of the tribunal in the state’s official Gazette under ISRWD Act 1956.The Neradi barrage being constructed over Vamsadhara river would help irrigate 2.5 lakh acres in Srikakulam district. In 1977, the AP government constructed the Gotta Barrage under Phase 1 of the project to utilise 30 thousand million cubic feet of water to irrigate nearly 2 lakh acres of land. Under Phase 2, the construction of Neradi barrage, about 48 km upstream of Gotta barrage was proposed. The barrage is also expected to provide water to 30,000 acres of land in Odisha.But Odisha government has been opposing the project arguing that it would leave hundreds of acres of many farmlands in Rayagada and Gajapathi districts submerged. The Vamsadhara river originates in Kalahandi district of Odisha and joins the Bay of Bengal at Kalingapatnam in Andhra Pradesh. While 154 km of the river lies in Odisha, 82 km flows in Andhra Pradesh.The water dispute led to the formation of Vamsadhara Water Disputes Tribunal in 2010 which in its final order in 2017 allowed the Andhra government to construct the barrage and directed Odisha to acquire 106 acres of land in Odisha and hand it over to Andhra for construction. The tribunal also ordered the yield of 115 TMC of the river at Gotta barrage should be shared equally by both states.Despite the tribunal’s orders, the Odisha government has not made any land acquisition. Amid the ongoing dispute, the Andhra Pradesh government built a side weir in 2018 to utilise 8 TMC of water of the 70 TMC that was going unused.The two chief ministers also discussed Jhanjabati and Polavaram projects that have become a major source of dispute between Andhra and Odisha. Though Andhra plans to use 4 TMC water from Jhanjabati river to irrigate over 24000 acres of land in Vizianagaram district, Odisha has been objecting to it arguing that several tribal villages will be submerged.Polavaram project, an under-construction multi-purpose project on the Godavari river in Andhra Pradesh is also being opposed by Odisha with the Naveen Patnaik government arguing that it would lead to submergence and displacement of several villages in the state. First envisaged by the British in 1941, the Polavaram project aims to construct a dam on the Godavari River and divert large quantities of water through a 174-km link canal to the Krishna River. The matter concerning the height of the proposed dam and reconstruction of the reservoir without the consent of the Odisha government is now pending before the SC.The two chief ministers also discussed the dispute over villages in Kotia grampanchayat of Koraput district of Odisha that escalated since last year. In August this year, the Supreme Court advised the Odisha and Andhra Pradesh governments to resolve the dispute over ownership of border villages through mutual discussions following a contempt petition filed by Odisha.Of the 28 villages in Kotia gram panchayat, Odisha did not survey 21 villages when it was formed in 1936. The same 21 villages were also not surveyed by Andhra Pradesh when it was formed leading to a dispute over these bordering villages.The Supreme Court in 1968 first ordered maintenance of status quo in the disputed area and in 2006 the apex court passed a permanent injunction on the disputed area. However, the dispute escalated when Andhra Pradesh on March 5 last year issued notification for panchayat elections in 3 of the villages in Kotia and held polls in February this year. Odisha told the court that these villages are under its administrative control and in the 2019 elections, the Kotia villages voted as part of Koraput Lok Sabha constituency and Pottangi assembly segment in Odisha.The two chief ministers said the states will work towards setting up a chair for Odia and Telugu languages in BR Ambedkar University, Srikakulam and Berhampur University, respectively. Besides, the appointment of language teachers in schools in border districts of the two states, supply of books and conduct of language examination will also be taken up to promote brotherhood.Both the states will continue the legacy of mutual cooperation and in the true spirit of federalism discuss issues between the two states....||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/odisha-andhra-pradesh-to-set-up-institutional-mechanism-to-address-interstate-issues-101636481529863.html
09-11-2021||Lucknow||BJP, SP trying to give communal colour to UP polls: Mayawati||Lucknow: Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati said on Tuesday that the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), in league with the Samajawadi Party, was trying to give a communal colour to the coming assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh by making it a Hindu- Muslim affair. To divert the attention of the people from its failure to fulfill promises, poor performance and anti- people policies, the BJP was raising the Ayodhya police firing issue whereas the SP was highlighting Mohammad Ali Jinnah. It showed the internal understanding between the BJP and SP to serve their vested political interests, she said. Both the BJP and SP strengthened each other. The ideology of SP and BJP was casteist and communal and both the parties were dependent on each other, she said, adding when SP was in power the BJP gained ground in UP, whereas it weakens when the BSP was in power. The people were aware of the designs of both the parties and they would not fall prey to the conspiracies of BJP and SP, she said. Addressing a press conference at the BSP state unit office, Mayawati said, “I want to tell chief minister Yogi Adityanath that like him I too do not have a family. The difference is that to show off he is dressed in saffron robes, his family is RSS whereas the people of all castes and religions are my family.” “During my government, schemes and projects were launched for all whereas the Yogi government has worked for the people belonging to a particular religion and some select castes. When my family members or that of other leaders work with a selfless motive, it cannot be termed as promoting dynasty in the party,” she said. “When I was Chief Minister I did not visit districts before election to lay the foundation stones or to make promises to the people, nor forced the government employees to attend political rallies. Senior BSP leaders hold meetings across the state, I collect feedback and review the progress of the campaign,” she said. The BJP was trying to take credit for the Purvanchal expressway, Jewar and Kushinagar international airports which was not correct. The plans of all the projects were prepared when BSP was in power but due to the hurdles put by the then Congress government , the projects could not be launched, she said. Now that the assembly elections were close, the ruling BJP and other parties had launched adrive to lure and trick the people with promises. The BJP government at the centre and in the state started a series of the announcements and foundation laying drive which was likely to continue till the announcement of the schedule of the assembly election. It clearly indicated that the BJP would face defeat in the 2022 assembly elections, she said. Except BSP, other rival parties had made several announcements to lure the voters that raises questions on the commitment and working of the political parties. Like SP, the Congress had made several tempting promises but the people would not believe the announcements. If the Congress had fulfilled 50% of the promises it made to the people, then it would not have been out of power from the centre, Uttar Pradesh and other states. There was difference in the words and deeds of the Congress whereas the BSP talked less and focused on work, she said. She said the people would not forget inflation and hike in the price of petroleum products. Fearing defeat in the assembly elections, the BJP government had slashed the price of petrol and diesel but after the elections they would collect the money from the people with interest. The free ration scheme would also be withdrawn after the polls, she said. Before the assembly elections, the BJP had claimed to win 300 seats while SP claimed that it would bag 400 seats. The claims of both the parties were childish. To ensure that both the parties won the seats claimed by their leaders, the Election Commission would have to increase the number of assembly seats to 1,000. Free and fair assembly election would tell which political party had the strength to win in Uttar Pradesh, she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bjp-sp-trying-to-give-communal-colour-to-up-polls-mayawati-101636481468618.html

Of the 100,137,366 doses administered by Tuesday (9pm) in the state, 68,057,912 have received at least one dose while 32,079,454 have received both doses. In terms of absolute numbers, Maharashtra has the second-highest tally of vaccination doses administered in the country, with Uttar Pradesh in the lead. However, when the population of regions are factored in, Maharashtra lags behind the national coverage rate: While at least 41.9% of the adult population in the country is partially vaccinated and 37.3% is fully vaccinated, in Maharashtra, the coverage rates are 39.3% and 35.1% respectively. Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope tweeted, “Today Maharashtra crossed benchmark of 100 Million covid vaccine doses. It was possible with active involvement of all district officers. Congratulations to all.”Dr Rahul Pandit, Director-critical care, Fortis Hospitals and member of the national Covid-19 task force described the feat as a milestone. “This accomplishment is a fruition of tremendous hard work, strategic acumen and timely intervention by the state and civic authorities, governing bodies, healthcare workers, community caregivers and responsible citizens. However, we must not let our guards down,” he said.The recent festive led to a sharp drop in innoculation in Mumbai, which reported 39% less vaccination in October compared to the previous month. According to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) data, around 95% of the city’s eligible population has been inoculated the first dose, while 56% of people have been fully vaccinated.According to civic body data, between September 1 and 29, over 2.6 million citizens were vaccinated, while the number dropped to 1.6 million until October 29. The data also shows that there has been no shortage of doses, as the civic body received 1.6 million doses in October against 1.7 million doses the previous month. This means that the civic body has surplus vaccine doses in stockMaharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray last week set the target of completing 100% first dose vaccination of the state’s 91.44 million population by November 30. Currently, the state has inoculated 74.38% of its targeted beneficiaries. The state crossed the 50 million mark of doses administered on August 17. Mumbai led the innoculation drive among districts (14,992,825 doses), followed by Pune (12,233,340) and Thane (8,437,825). Some districts like Nandurbar, Palghar, Hingoli, Gadchiroli and Solapur continued to lag in the vaccination drive. The government has launched Mission Kavach Kundal, a special campaign to boost its Covid-19 vaccination drive, on October 8 and set a target of vaccinating 1.5 million people a day.Maharashtra on Tuesday recorded 982 Covid-19 new cases with 27 deaths. The case tally of the state stood at 6,619,329 on Tuesday, while the toll touched 140,430. On Tuesday, 1,293 patients recovered from the infection.

Shah runs an online business while the main suspect Akhlaq Khan (45) lives in the same colony.In his complaint to the police, Shah said Khan visited him and said he would show him his new office, some 500 metres away.“Khan took me to his new office on a scooter at 6.30pm. Three more men reached there and held me hostage. They tied my hands and legs and asked me to hand over my car keys,” he said.

09-11-2021||Noida||Former employee arrested for stealing laptop parts from IT company in Noida||Police arrested a 35-year-old man on Tuesday for allegedly stealing laptop/computer parts from his office in Noida Sector 62 earlier this year, said officials.The suspect -- identified as Navneet Katiyar -- is a resident of Vaishali in Ghaziabad, and a native of Lakhimpur Kheri in Uttar Pradesh.Anand Hardi, senior director of the company, said in the complaint that Katiyar worked at the company as an IT support person from April 19, 2017, to February 17 this year. “He had full access to the company’s IT assets like laptops, desktops and IT storeroom... As most of the employees usually complained that their laptops or desktops were slow, we got those checked and found that the standard configurations -- 20 gigabyte (GB) and 16GB memory -- of the systems were reduced to 8GB and 4GB. The company’s business was affected due to the slow systems,” Hardi said.The company conducted an internal investigation, and sacked Katiyar on February 17, 2021, after he was found guilty of theft. It suffered an estimated ₹45 lakh loss due to the theft of memory card and hard discs of the systems.The management team of the Information Technology (IT) firm filed a case against Katiyar at the Sector 58 police station on February 18 this year, said the station house officer (SHO), Vinod Kumar. Police immediately launched a search to nab the suspect as he escaped after the incident.After months, police received a tip about the movement of Katiyar near Noida Sector 62 roundabout on Tuesday.“A police team arrested him from there. Katiyar revealed during interrogation that he had doctored 76 laptops and 32 computers, and stolen the memory modules and hard discs,” said SHO Kumar, adding that the suspect was produced before a court and sent to judicial custody on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/former-employee-arrested-for-stealing-laptop-parts-from-it-company-in-noida-101636481108469.html
09-11-2021||Noida||Four arrested for murder of senior-citizen couple in Ghaziabad on Diwali||The Ghaziabad police on Tuesday claimed to have cracked the double-murder case of a senior-citizen couple, and arrested four suspects.Both Ashok Jaidka, 72, and his wife Madhu Jaidka, 70, were murdered at their home late on the night of Diwali (November 4). During the investigation, police found CCTV camera footage in which two unidentified suspects were spotted entering the couple’s house and leaving within 5-6 minutes. Police identified the four suspects as Sundar Tiriya, his friend Atul Kumar, their accomplice Azad Kumar, and another man Rohit Narula, who owns a two-wheeler distribution firm in Sahibabad. “During the course of the investigation, we found that Tiriya, who had been on the run since the incident, had been living with the couple for the past 10 years and looking after them. In October, Ashok Jaidka asked him to either leave the house or start paying him ₹4,000 per month as rent. Tiriya was infuriated because Jaidka never paid him anything for his services, and instead misbehaved with him several times. Tiriya hatched a plan and called his friend Atul Kumar from his hometown on the pretext of getting him married. He then convinced his friend to help him with the plan,” said Nipun Agarwal, superintendent of police (city 1). Both Tiriya and Atul Kumar belong to Chhatarpur in Madhya Pradesh. “Narula was a friend of Jaidka and also handled his finances. He owed Jaidka ₹60 lakh and had only managed to pay back about ₹30 lakh so far. So, when Tiriya met him in October, Narula allegedly instigated him to take revenge against Jaidka,” the SP said. Thereafter, Tiriya also roped in Azad Kumar , a caretaker at the Jaidkas’ godown. The police said that Tiriya told him that he could take all the scrap in the godown if they get rid of the couple. “On the night of Diwali, Tiriya and Atul Kumar went to Jaidka’s house and hit the victims on the head with a hammer, while Azad Kumar acted as a lookout. With the help of CCTV camera footage, electronic surveillance and manual intelligence, we found the suspects and arrested them,” the SP said. The police said that the suspects were arrested from Patel Nagar area under the jurisdiction of Sihani Gate police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/four-arrested-for-murder-of-senior-citizen-couple-in-ghaziabad-on-diwali-101636481048424.html

The treated water from the two STPs will be used for irrigation and horticulture purposes, thereby saving the groundwater, they added.“We have expedited the work, and the project will be completed by February-end next year,” said Rajiv Tyagi, chief general manager of the Noida authority. He also said that work progress of all the important infrastructure projects in Noida was reviewed during Diwali last week.The authority started working on the two STPs with a total capacity of 180MLD in July 2020, and the deadline for the project was fixed for December-end 2022. There are already STPs of 35MLD and 40MLD capacity in Noida sectors 123 and 168, respectively, but the authority decided to construct two more STPs in these areas as new residential and commercial developments have been taking place there.At present, Noida has got six STPs -- two (34MLD and 25MLD capacity) in Sector 50, two (33MLD and 54MLD) in Sector 54, one (35MLD) in Sector 123, and one (40MLD) in Sector 168.The Noida authority had hired the WAPCOS Limited to design the water supply and sewerage systems in these areas. WAPCOS Limited -- earlier known as Water and Power Consultancy Services Limited -- is an Indian multinational government undertaking and consultancy firm wholly owned by the Ministry of Jal Shakti, Government of India. The firm provides consultancy services in the fields of water resources, power and infrastructure. It had been stressing on the need to ready STPs having a capacity of 411MLD by the end of 2021.According to the officials, additional STPs are required in these areas as the Noida authority has earmarked sectors 128, 129,130, 135, 150 and 151 for group housing projects, and also commercial complexes. They said that more than 50% of the civil work has been achieved at both the sites.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/2-new-sewage-treatment-plants-to-become-functional-in-noida-by-february-end-2022-101636480988544.html

09-11-2021||Mumbai||Cruise drugs raid case: Prabhakar Sail questioned for second day by NCB vigilance team||A vigilance team of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) questioned Prabhakar Sail, a key witness in the cruise ship drug raid case for the second consecutive day on Tuesday.Sail, who made his first appearance before the agency on Monday, was questioned in the Central Reserve Police Force’s mess in Bandra (West) for nine hours. He was accompanied by his lawyer Tushar Khandare.The NCB instituted a vigilance probe (referred to as a special enquiry team) under Deputy Director General Gyaneshwar Singh on October 25, following the allegations made in a notarised affidavit filed by Sail on October 23.In the affidavit, Sail claimed to have overheard a phone call between his employer Kiran P Gosavi — another witness in the cruise ship drug raid case — and Sam D’Souza. “You put a bomb of 25 crores and let’s settle at 18 final, because we have to give 8 crores to Sameer Wankhede,” Gosavi told a certain person named Sam D’Souza, the affidavit stated. Wankhede, NCB zonal director conducted a raid on Cordelia, a cruise ship docked in Mumbai on October 2, which led to the arrest of at least 20 persons including Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son, Aryan (23).Sail also claimed in his affidavit that Gosavi met Khan’s lawyer, Pooja Dadlani, and purportedly struck a deal of taking ₹50 lakh in exchange for Aryan’s release.On Tuesday Gyaneshwar Singh also met Mumbai police commissioner Hamant Nagrale and requested access to CCTV footage of certain sites mentioned in Sail’s affidavit where Gosavi purportedly met Dadlani. Nagrale confirmed meeting Singh but refused to divulge further details. On Monday, Singh and his team also visited the cruise ship and Tardeo, where Sail reportedly collected two bags containing ₹50 lakh from Dadlani, as per his affidavit. The vigilance team arrived in Mumbai on October 27 and has recorded the statement of eight persons, including Wankhede and investigating officer V.V Singh. Wankhede has denied all allegations made in the affidavit. The Special Investigation Team (SIT) of NCB Delhi led by Sanjay Singh, which took over the investigation of six cases registered by Mumbai NCB this year, including the cruise ship drug raid case, summoned Karan Sajnani, a British national accused in a case involving Nationalist Congress Party leader Nawab Malik’s son-in-law, Sameer Khan. Sajnani has been asked to meet the NCB on Wednesday to record his statement. Sajnani was arrested by Mumbai NCB in January after the agency raided in his flat at Khar where they allegedly seized around 200 kg of imported strains of ganja. Sameer Khan and Sajnani are out on bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cruise-drugs-raid-case-prabhakar-sail-questioned-for-second-day-by-ncb-vigilance-team-101636480810059.html
09-11-2021||Kolkata||Ready to probe Bengal’s Metro Dairy disinvestment, CBI tells high court||KOLKATA:  The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Tuesday told the Calcutta high court that, if ordered, it can probe the West Bengal government’s sale of its 47% stake in Metro Dairy to the project’s sole private partner which, a short while later, transferred 15% of its shares to a Singapore-based firm for a much higher price. This is the only disinvestment made by the Mamata Banerjee government since 2011 when the Trinamool Congress (TMC) first came to power.The division bench of chief justice Prakash Shrivastava and justice Indra Prasanna Mukerji was hearing a petition filed by West Bengal Congress president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury in 2018, demanding a probe by a central agency into what he alleged was a scam. Metro Dairy was established in 1991 as a public-private venture. The state-run West Bengal Milk Producers Federation had 47 % stake, the Centre-run National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) had 10% and the remaining 43% was owned by Keventer Agro Ltd. NDDB later sold its entire stake to Keventer. In 2017, the state government approved the sale of the remaining 47% in an auction. Keventer was the only one to bid.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) started an investigation in 2019 and questioned officials of Keventer Agro Ltd, the project’s sole private partner at the time of the sale, and at least four Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officers working for the state government. It is unclear what the outcome of this probe was.After hearing the petitioner and CBI on Tuesday, the two-judge bench ordered all parties, including the state government and Keventer Agro, to file affidavits by December 10 and said the final hearing will take place on December 16, according to lawyer Pratip Kumar Chatterjee, who represented Chowdhury.Chowdhury’s petition says that in August 2017, the Bengal cabinet approved the sale of the government’s entire 47% stake in Metro Dairy Ltd to Keventer Agro Ltd for around ₹85 crore. Keventer sold 15% of its shares to a Singapore-based company for around ₹135 crore a few weeks after becoming the company’s sole owner.Chowdhury alleged in his petition that the government, which set up the company with public money, suffered a loss of at least ₹500 crore by selling its stakes to Keventer at a very low price.Registered in Kolkata, Metro Dairy Ltd has an authorized share capital of Rs.160,000,000 and paid-up capital of Rs. 61,276,000, the company’s website said on Tuesday.Chowdhury said, “People of Bengal have the right to know why the state sold its shares at such low price. Who decided on this price? There was corruption at every level of this deal. I want a probe by a neutral agency.” BJP national vice-president Dilip Ghosh seconded Chowdhury. “This should be probed by the CBI,” he said. West Bengal government officials refused to speak on this issue. TMC state general secretary Kunal Ghosh said, “At a time when the Bharatiya Janata Party is demanding a CBI probe into every minor incident in Bengal just to keep Mamata Banejee under pressure, Chowdhury is helping it. The government will give details of the sale to the court.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/ready-to-probe-bengal-s-metro-dairy-disinvestment-cbi-tells-high-court-101636480688308.html
09-11-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab Cabinet decides to regularise services of 36,000 employees||The Punjab cabinet on Tuesday decided to regularise the services of 36,000 employees working on contract, ad hoc, work charged, daily wages and temporary basis. Employees with more than 10 years of service would be regularised, chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi said at his press conference after the cabinet meeting. The draft “Punjab Protection and Regularisation of Contractual Employees Bill-2021” to be introduced in the ongoing session of the state assembly was also approved by the cabinet. It also gave approval for the extra creation of deemed posts. The provisions of reservation policy would be followed during the regularisation process of these employees, according to a spokesperson of the chief minister’s office (CMO). However, this decision of regularisation would not be a binding on the boards and corporations. In December 2016, the then SAD-BJP government had also passed the Punjab Adhoc, Contractual, Daily Wage, Temporary, Work Charged and Outsourced Employees’ Welfare Bill, 2016, in a special session convened ahead of the 2017 state polls, to regularise the series of 30,000 employees of various government departments. However, the regularisation of services did not fructify. Repeal of Contract Farming Act The cabinet also decided to repeal the Punjab Contract Farming Act, 2013, in view of the dilemma and fear in the minds of farmers of the state due to its strict provisions like imprisonment, monetary penalties and other rigorous punishments. The decision has been taken in the larger interest of the state farmers, the spokesperson said. The cabinet also approved the “Punjab Horticulture Nursery Bill-2021” to be introduced in the state assembly session by amending “Punjab Fruit Nurseries Act-1961”. The amended Act is necessitated in view of drastic changes in the new technologies like IT, GPS tagging, traceability etc. and these developments are essentially to be made part of this Act. OTS scheme for unauthorised constructionsThe cabinet also gave nod to promulgate “The Punjab One-Time Voluntary Disclosure and Settlement of Violations of the Buildings Bill, 2021” for all unauthorised constructions, which have come up till September 30, 2021. The scheme, based on the recommendations submitted by a cabinet sub-committee headed by local bodies minister Brahm Mohindra, is aimed at providing one-time opportunity to the violators within the municipal areas who have made non-compoundable violations in the buildings for regularisation without compromising on public safety/security and convenience. The compounding fee has also been reduced by 25%. There are a large number of unauthorised constructions where buildings plans have not been approved. Most of the violations are non-compoundable and therefore such buildings cannot be regularised under the existing provisions. “The state government therefore feels that the best course of action to deal with such buildings is to regularise them provided these meet fire and safety standards and do not compromise on public safety/security and convenience & also to stop future unauthorised constructions,” said the official spokesperson. Power plants’ tariff to be re-determined “The Punjab Energy Security, Termination of PPAs and Redetermination of Power Tariff Bill, 2021”, which is to be placed in the state assembly for enactment, was also approved by the cabinet to refer PPAs with Nabha Power Limited and Talwandi Sabo Power Limited to PSERC for re-determination of tariff. It also gave a go ahead to the “Punjab Renewable Energy Security, Reform, Termination and Re-determination of Power Tariff Bill, 2021,” to be placed in the ongoing session. Hike in minimum wages A hike of ₹415.89 in minimum wages has been approved by the cabinet with effect from March 1, 2020, and September 1, 2020. The minimum wage has now been revised from ₹8,776.83 to ₹9,192.72. A worker would also be entitled to get arrears of ₹8,251 from March 1, 2020 up to October, 2021. The cabinet also accorded approval to the universalisation of Ayushman Bharat - Mukh Mantri Sehat Bima Yojana, under which the entire population of Punjab would be provided an insurance cover of ₹5 lakh per family per year, except for state and central government employees and pensioners. It also approved “The Punjab (Institutional and Other Building) Tax Repeal Bill, 2021” to be introduced in the current session of Punjab Vidhan Sabha to waive unpaid dues in all cases. This decision would give a relief of ₹250 crore to the beneficiaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-cabinet-decides-to-regularise-services-of-36-000-employees-101636480510079.html
09-11-2021||Mumbai||Sameer Wankhede father’s suit an attempt to hide illegalities: Nawab Malik to high court||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Nawab Malik told the Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday that Dnyandev Wankhede’s defamation suit against him was an attempt to cover up the illegal activities Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) zonal director Sameer Wankhede, and was an attempt to curtail Malik’s “freedom of expression”. Malik submitted an affidavit in the HC in response to the defamation suit filed by Dhyandev Wankhede, seeking damages to the tune of ₹1.25 crore and also an order restraining the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader from making any false or incorrect statements against the Wankhede family that would defame or harm their reputation.Malik’s affidavit stated that none of the statements made by him was incorrect and that the evidence produced by him has helped the government machinery take corrective steps against Sameer Wankhede. Malik’s response said that Dnyandev distorted facts to get a favourable order. In the past month, Malik has made a series of allegations against Wankhede who conducted a raid on a cruise ship on October 2, following which Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son, Aryan (23) was arrested. Wankhede had also arrested Malik’s son-in-law, Sameer Khan, in January, in a case that Malik claims in a false one. Malik has called the cruise ship raid “fake” and accused Wankhede and others of plotting to “kidnap" Aryan with the aim of extorting money. Last month, Malik also accused Wankhede of forging a caste certificate to get a position in the Indian Revenue Service, and said that the Wankhedes were Muslim.Dnyandev and Wankhede have refuted all claims made by Malik.“The plaintiff (Dnyandev) has made big hue and cry when the Defendant has produced this birth certificate, thereby alleging that his name is not Dawood and he nor his son, are Muslim by religion. I say that the said certificate is issued by the MCGM [civic body]. I say that if the said birth certificate issued by the MCGM is false, then it is for the Plaintiff or said Sameer Wankhede to take corrective steps and purse it with MCGM. It is pertinent to note here that if according to the Plaintiff said birth certificate is false, then the Plaintiff should have produced the correct birth certificate. The Plaintiff, till date, have not produced any other birth certificate to contradict the birth certificate produced by the Defendant, which falsifies the Plaintiff’s case to great extent.” “The plaintiff, by filing the present suit, is trying to curtail the freedom of expression granted to the defendant under Article 19 of the Constitution of India, which the defendant uses for public good,” Malik’s affidavit said.The affidavit was filed in the defamation suit which was heard by the single judge vacation bench of justice Madhav Jamdar on Monday. The suit had sought interim relief in the form of an injunction which would restrain Malik from posting statements and comments that were defamatory in nature against the Wankhede family. After hearing the suit the bench had directed Malik to file a response within a day and posted hearing to Wednesday November 10. The affidavit concludes stating that, “The present suit is nothing but an attempt to cover up the illegalities committed by the Plaintiff’s son and the same should be dismissed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sameer-wankhede-father-s-suit-an-attempt-to-hide-illegalities-nawab-malik-to-high-court-101636480448322.html

09-11-2021||Lucknow||Make seat belts must in passenger buses: UP transport dept to Centre||The Uttar Pradesh transport department has urged the Centre to make the use of seat belts mandatory in all passenger buses, including school buses and other heavy vehicles, people aware of the matter said. The move, they said, was aimed at minimising deaths and injuries in road accidents. The current rules have the seat belt provision only for persons occupying front-facing rear seats that too only in those vehicles that do not have more than eight seats, apart from the driver’s seat. The department has made the recommendation it received in this regard from social activist, technocrat and Sarvebhyo Foundation founder Alok Singh.“You are requested to consider amending section 125 (1) of the Central Motor Vehicle Rules, 1989/issuing necessary directions providing for seat belt use by all people in passenger buses of all categories,” additional transport commissioner, enforcement, VK Sonakiya said in a letter to the joint secretary, road transport and highways, on November 3. Sub-rule 1(A) of the Rule 125 of the Central Motor Vehicle Rules mandates that the manufacturer of every motor vehicle of M1 category shall equip every motor vehicle with a seatbelt for a person occupying the front-facing rear seat.“This sub-rule in simple terms means that apart from the driver and co-passenger seat in the front, the seat belt for the front-facing rear seat passenger is mandatory in only those vehicles that do not have more than nine seats, including the driver seat and it is not mandatory for passengers of a vehicle having more than nine seats,” Alok Singh explained in the proposal.“This also means that even for eight-seat vehicles, the seat belt is not mandatory for seats that are in a vertical position not facing the front of the vehicle,” he added. All school buses, he pointed out, had more than nine seats.“There have been heart-wrenching passenger bus accidents resulting in loss of innocent lives. Many of them would have been saved had they been wearing seat belts,” Singh claimed. He suggested that apart from the provision of seatbelts in all passenger buses and heavy vehicles, there must be an additional provision of instructions being played out on sound systems urging passengers on board to fasten their seat belts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/make-seat-belts-must-in-passenger-buses-up-transport-dept-to-centre-101636479788229.html

09-11-2021||Lucknow||Samajwadi Party launches perfume to spread the ‘scent of socialism’ in UP||Ahead of the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav on Tuesday launched a specially made "Samajwadi perfume", hoping to spread the "scent of socialism" in the state.The perfume, a mix of 22 natural "attars" (fragrances), has been prepared in Kannauj.Kannauj is called the "Attar Nagri" and has been the stronghold of the Samajwadi Party, represented by Dimple Yadav and Akhilesh Yadav in the Lok Sabha in the past.Kannauj MLC Pushraj Jain said the perfume packed in a red-green bottle and its box having a picture of the party president was prepared by two scientists in four months."We also took directions from the national president in this task and he guided us. The speciality of this perfume is that from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, 22 natural 'attars' have been used in it," he said."When you use it, you will feel the 'sugandh of samajwad', brotherhood, love and amity," he said, adding that the soil of Kannauj has also been used in it.On the significance of 22 natural fragrances used in the perfume, he said it was because the elections in the state are slated for 2022 and the perfume will help overcome "hatred by bringing in an atmosphere of love and brotherhood".The SP MLC also spoke about future plans in the wake of 2024 Lok Sabha elections.Another perfume is being prepared, which will use 24 natural scents, to overcome hatred in the 2024 elections, Jain said.The perfume was distributed among all party leaders and members of the press present on the occasion.Speaking on the occasion, Akhilesh Yadav said people will go among the public applying this perfume to make them remember socialist ideology and the Samajwadi Party."Its colour is also red and green," he stressed.Later in a Hindi tweet, Akhilesh said, "The scent has been given to everyone as a gift because the flower of lies does not give fragrance."Earlier too in 2016, the SP had launched a perfume with four fragrances to mark four years of its rule in the state.Meanwhile, taking a dig at Akhilesh Yadav, UP BJP president Swatantra Dev Singh said the perfume launched by him is not going to remove the "stink of sins" of the party.People of the state will no longer give a chance to the "toxic cocktail of Samajwadi Party's hooliganism and corruption, Singh said, adding no matter how much perfume the SP chief applies, the public is not going to be attracted towards him.People of the state have not forgotten how goons were glorified during the SP tenure, he said, adding that they used to roam in ministers' vehicles and the government withdrew cases against terrorists."The reality is that one who chants the name of Mohammad Ali Jinnah 24 hours a day can never see the development of the state. He only sees dreams of partition," Singh added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/samajwadi-party-launches-perfume-to-spread-the-scent-of-socialism-in-up-101636478887385.html

09-11-2021||Gurugram||Only segregated waste to be collected from Thursday||Starting Thursday, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) will collect only segregated waste from households in the city, officials said, emphasising that mixed waste will not be picked up. The civic body also plans to start penalising residents found dumping accumulated mixed waste in public spaces from later this month.Officials said that waste should be segregated in three bins, categorised as biodegradable waste, dry waste and reject sanitary waste (medical waste). The segregated waste will be collected from homes in vehicles having separate compartments for the same, following which it would be taken to the four waste transfer stations for processing. Vaishali Sharma, additional commissioner, MCG, said that residents have been trained on how to segregate waste, with special sessions organised at various localities. “It is known to all that waste should be segregated while disposing of, according to the norms of Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, and we had given residents time till November 10 to understand how it should be done. Special training sessions were also conducted at different localities, while we were setting up infrastructure at our end. From Thursday onwards, if any resident gives mixed waste, it will not be collected from their doorstep and after November 20, we will start issuing challans to the violators. If anyone tries to dump the accumulated mixed waste in their neighbourhood, then they will be fined ₹5,000,” said Sharma.The MCG has also issued a toll-free number — 18001801817 — for residents to lodge complaints or get more information on the process. Sharma said that residents can also lodge complaints if the collection vehicles do not have separate compartments for segregated waste. Dhruv Bansal, spokesperson, Gurgaon Citizens Council (GCC), an umbrella body of residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) in the city, said, “There has been no intimation from MCG on how the segregated waste will be collected from the residential societies. I am still getting feedback from residents that the waste collecting vehicles visiting their areas do not have separate compartments. If the systems are in place, then why is it not being implemented? If vehicles with separate compartments are sent, then residents who are not segregating waste at present will also start following it as, otherwise, waste will not be collected.”Officials of Ecogreen Energy, the MCG’s concessionaire for door-to-door collection of waste in the city, said that they are prepared to collect segregated waste and have informed their staff that mixed waste should not be collected. Sanjeev Sharma, the spokesperson for Ecogreen Energy, said, “We have trained all our staff on how segregated waste must be collected in separate compartments, in all waste collecting vehicles. Waste will be collected as biodegradable (wet waste, horticulture waste), medical waste and non-biodegradable (recyclable waste). There will also be a small box for domestic and hazardous waste, such as used paint containers, pesticides and other items. The segregated waste will be brought to the four transfer stations at Kadipur, Atul Kataria Chowk, Sushant Lok and Beri Bagh for processing.” On December 25, 2020, the MCG observed its first Zero Waste Day, when only wet waste is collected from households. Since mid-March this year, the corporation has been observing zero waste days every Tuesday to train residents on waste segregation. Officials said that residents have been given six months of training in segregation of waste and hence, decided to carry it out on a full-time basis ahead of the Swachh Survekshan 2022, for which ‘Kachra alag karo’ (separating waste) is a major component. In the last week of October, the corporation issued directions to its sanitation wing and officials of Ecogreen Energy to make citizens aware of what they need to do to segregate waste. The MCG officials had then said that the segregation of waste is also aimed at converting wet waste into compost and recycling dry waste to the maximum possible extent so that the waste load carried to the overburdened Bandhwari landfill can be reduced, as around 2.5 million tonnes of legacy waste is currently dumped at the landfill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/only-segregated-waste-to-be-collected-from-thursday-101636478589479.html
09-11-2021||Gurugram||Respiratory illnesses on the rise due to post-Diwali toxic air||Due to the worsening of air quality since Diwali, cases of respiratory diseases in out-patient departments (OPDs) of hospitals across the city have gone up in the last few days. Doctors said that most complaints pertain to asthma attacks, breathing difficulties, bronchitis and burning sensation in the eyes, among other issues. “Post Diwali, the air quality index jumped to very dangerous levels, which is leading to spike in respiratory cases. The respiratory OPD footfall has increased by 40% with people presenting with increased cough, chest congestion, breathing difficulty, runny nose and fever. There is increase in asthma attack cases by 25% and lung infections by 20%. The emergency admissions due to the acute respiratory illness has spiked also by 30%,” said Dr Manoj Goel, director of Pulmonology, Fortis Memorial Research Institute. He advised residents, especially those who have pre-existing lung diseases and those who have had severe Covid-19 infection, to avoid going outdoors. For three consecutive days following Diwali, Gurugram had a ‘severe’ air quality index, which implies that the air quality is hazardous and may cause respiratory effects even to healthy people and serious health impacts to people with lung or heart diseases. Over the past two days, there has been a marginal improvement in air quality, which is currently classified as ‘very poor’, also harmful for residents. Amid such high levels of pollution, those suffering from heart diseases, asthma, and other respiratory diseases are advised to avoid undue and prolonged exposure, under the Graded Response Action Plan to control air pollution.Paras Hospital in the city has witnessed about a 10% rise in new patients in emergency and OPDs with chest congestion symptoms, with some who have no history of respiratory illnesses, said Dr Arunesh Kumar, head of the department of pulmonology at the hospital. At Civil Hospital in Sector 10, doctors said that over 350 patients have visited the hospital with issues of acute respiratory infection, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), acute bronchitis, bronchial asthma and fever. “In the past three days, maximum cases in the medicine OPD are of patients with respiratory issues. This will continue for a few days as pollution levels had spiked a lot. The temperatures are also dropping, so that also impacts recovery from such infections,” said Dr Manish Rathi, deputy medical superintendent of Civil Hospital. Doctors also said that many patients are those who have recovered from Covid-19 earlier this year. “We see a rise in such cases every year around this time, but this year, it is on a higher scale as many are Covid-19 recovered patients, whose lungs are already compromised. These patients were fine after recovery, but as they got exposed to high levels of pollution, they had worsening of shortness of breath and we had to give antibiotics and use nebulizers in emergency cases between 40 and 70 years of age,” said Dr Ashutosh Shukla, senior director of internal medicine at Max Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/respiratory-illnesses-on-the-rise-due-to-post-diwali-toxic-air-101636478588236.html

ED also wants to record Vaze’s statement under section 50 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).The crime branch, however, on Tuesday opposed the plea saying that they are already conducting an investigation and the ED cannot quiz any accused that are in the Mumbai crime branch’s custody.Special public prosecutor Shekhar Jagtap said, “No agency can interfere in the investigation of other agencies. They are trying to sabotage our investigation. We can not allow them for two hours or for two days. Our probe is already on. Two investigations can not go hand in hand.”After hearing the arguments of the ED and the crime branch, the court rejected the ED’s plea.ED’s case against Deshmukh is based on the Central Bureau of Investigation’s (CBI) first information report (FIR) filed on the allegations made by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh against Deshmukh. Singh alleged that Deshmukh had asked Vaze and other police officers to collect ₹100 crore every month from the restaurants and bars of Mumbai.Vaze is in the crime branch’s custody in the Goregaon police’s August FIR registered under charges of extortion against Singh, Vaze, and others. The case was registered on the basis of a complaint by Agarwal, alleging that the accused extorted ₹11.92 lakh from him.Vaze was previously arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in the Antilia explosives scare and Mansukh Hiran murder cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/court-rejects-ed-s-plea-of-urgently-questioning-vaze-in-crime-branch-s-custody-101636477088098.html

09-11-2021||Mumbai||₹20 crore extortion case: Param Bir Singh co-accused in CID custody till November 16||A city magistrate court on Tuesday sent two police officers accused in the ₹20 crore extortion case related to former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh to state Crime Investigation Department (CID) custody till November 16. The CID also filed an application before the court seeking a non-bailable warrant (NBW) against Singh, who already has two NBWs against him.Police inspectors Nandkumar Gopale, currently with the police training centre, Khandala, and Asha Korke – posted at local arms, Naigaon – were named the co-accused along with Singh in the first information report (FIR) registered at Marine Drive police station following a complaint by Bhayander-based developer Shyamsunder Agrawal. Three other police personnel have been named as the other accused in the case – deputy commissioner of police Akbar Pathan, and two assistant commissioners of police Shrikant Shinde and Sanjay Patil.Gopale, a 20-year veteran with Mumbai Police, played a key role in high-profile cases including the Indian Premier League betting case in 2013; the Indian Mujaheddeen case in 2008 when he, along with a future Mumbai police commissioner Rakesh Maria, arrested 20 Indian Mujahideen operatives that were allegedly responsible for bomb blasts India since 2005; and crime reporter J Dey’s murder case in 2011. Korke, a senior police officer said, is a low-profile inspector with the local arms unit.Special public prosecutor Shekhar Jagtap said the accused officers had allegedly extorted ₹50 lakh in cash from Sharad Agrawal, the complainant’s nephew, by threatening to arrest his uncle in a false case. “This money was arranged via a hawala operator named Momin, an old associate of Sanjay Punamiya, a co-accused in the case and also Agarwal’s ex-business partner,” Jagtap said.He added, “CID officers established the link between the arrested officers, the hawala operator and the main accused Punamiya. CID has obtained scientific evidence against the two officers that indicated that they have accepted ₹50 lakh in cash.”In his FIR, Agrawal had alleged that earlier in 2021, Juhu police had filed an extortion case against him, accusing him of having links with underworld don Chhota Shakeel. Later, the police applied Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) in the case. Agrawal claimed that, based on this false case, Singh and his junior officers extorted money from him at the behest of Punamiya, the main accused in the case.A few days later, Gopale, who was then the Mumbai crime branch unit 9 in-charge, raided Agrawal’s Bhayandar and Vile Parle homes. During these raids, the accused police officers had illegally seized some partnership documents and other papers without making any official entry. Later, the photocopies of these documents were found in Punamiya’s possession, stated the FIR filed by Marine Drive police.Former Thane and Mumbai police commissioner Singh is wanted by multiple law enforcement agencies and the CID is probing at least three of the five FIRs filed against him. “There are two non-bailable warrants issued against Singh. On Tuesday, we urged court to issue an NBW as well,” said Jagtap. A look-out circular (LoC) is already in force against Singh. Apart from this, two open inquiries have been initiated against the 1988-batch senior Indian Police Service (IPS) officer by the state anti-corruption bureau (ACB) over the corruption allegations made against him by two serving police inspectors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/20-crore-extortion-case-param-bir-singh-co-accused-in-cid-custody-till-november-16-101636475647911.html

09-11-2021||Mumbai||MLC polls: Voting for 6 seats in 5 local authorities’ constituencies on Dec 10||The Election Commission of India (ECI) has announced the biennial elections for six seats from five local authorities’ constituencies to be held on December 10. The Shiv Sena, Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have two members each in the upper house, who are retiring on January 1, 2022, thereby necessitating the polls. Two seats from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporations and one each from Kolhapur, Dhule-Nandurbar, Akola-Buldhana-Washim local authorities’ constituencies will be elected to the legislative council. Currently, Ramdas Kadam (Shiv Sena) and Bhai Jagtap (Congress) represent Mumbai, while Satej Patil (Congress) has been elected from Kolhapur, Amrish Patel (BJP) from Dhule-Nandurbar, Gopikishan Bajoria (Shiv Sena) from Akola-Buldhana-Washim and Girish Vyas (BJP) has been elected from Nagpur. Twenty two members are elected to the 78-member upper house, which has the majority of the three ruling parties – Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress. As the representatives are to be elected from the local bodies, the parties holding them currently are likely to retain it based on the strength they have in the respective constituencies. The Sena is, however, likely to drop Kadam as its candidate from Mumbai local body in the backdrop of the recent controversy over ‘anti-party activities’. The Congress is expected to repeat both its sitting law makers, though winning a seat from Mumbai could be a challenge before it owing to the dwindled number of party corporators. BJP enjoys the majority in Nagpur and Dhule-Nandurbar local bodies, that could help it to retain both its seats. ECI has deferred the elections to two seats to be elected from Solapur and Ahmednagar local bodies after the percentage of the electors dropped down 75% owing to various reasons. The members elected from these bodies are retiring on January 1. The last day of filing the nomination for the polls is November 23, while the last day of withdrawal of the nomination is November 26. The counting will be held on December 14. Meanwhile, 12 seats to be appointed from the Governor’s quota to the upper house remain to be vacant as the Bhagat Singh Koshyari has not yet cleared the list of names moved by the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mlc-polls-voting-for-6-seats-in-5-local-authorities-constituencies-on-dec-10-101636475107754.html
09-11-2021||Delhi||Chhath Puja: Back at ghats in Delhi-NCR, with Covid-19 safety protocols||New DelhiVed Vriti, an MPhil research scholar at Delhi University is dressing up for Chhath Puja. “This festival is like a part of my identity. On Chhath, we worship the Sun God. We pray for our family, offsprings and health, and sing folk songs. Since a lot of us have migrated from Bihar and parts of Uttar Pradesh to the city of Delhi, it makes us nostalgic of our land and we feel emotional and connected whenever this festival arrives.” The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) has allowed celebration of Chhath Puja in public, at some designated places, except the Yamuna Ghat. Amid strict adherence to Covid-19 protocols, there’s still a wave of happiness among the devotees from the Purvanchali community in Delhi; who could celebrate the festival only by building temporary pools at the terrace of their homes last year. Chhath Puja at the ghats, which is usually celebrated on the sixth day after Diwali, falls on November 10 this year. “In 2020, many observed the rituals on their terraces but the essence of ghats was missing,” says Vriti, adding: “I personally liked it from the health and safety point of view, of my family since Covid-19 was at its peak then. But it’s also true that the feel of ghats, and the festival’s historical context got compromised. In fact, our house help was way too disturbed last year when she got to know that going to the ghats was not an option. Due to lack of space for a pool, she thought her fast wouldn’t be successful, but later she, along with a few other womenfolk from her neighbourhood decided to do the puja together, in the nearby community area.” Sanjay Gupta, deputy president of Rama Vihar Chhath Puja Samiti, who is set to organise a puja at a designated pond in Rohini following all safety protocols. This pond will be visited by devotees from neighbouring areas such as Mubarakpur, Majara Dabas, Rohini, Karala and Utsav Vihar. “People, last time, celebrated in their homes and at the terraces. The celebrations were not allowed in public places. They’re happy to congregate this time around, even if it is at a pond and not at the Yamuna. But we still plan to barricade the pond at the Chhath Ghaat. We would manage the crowds, and only vratis (people who are observing fast) will be allowed to take a dip in the pond, and offer water to Sun God. But all this will be in groups of not more than five, to avoid crowding,” informs Gupta, adding that the sanction only came in around Diwali, leaving them less time for preparations. “Taiyyari late ho gayi, toh thodi habdadi ki situation hai.”Socially distanced celebrationsEnsuring Covid-19 safety protocols, Arvind Thakur, a functionary at the Purvachal Chhath Puja Committee in Dwarka Vihar, Najafgarh, shares, “Families that are not going back to their home town, or those who are now completely based in Delhi, will celebrate Chhath at these ponds. We plan to keep the affair socially distanced, and have assured local authorities about it as well. All protocols will be duly followed. There are about 50-60 people who observe the fast, and turn up to offer prayers each year. These people wait for it all year long and were looking forward to celebrating. So it’s good that at least restricted celebrations will be allowed this year.”Gate pass to double vaccinated peoplePN Singh, president, Chhath Puja Samiti at the Crossings Republik Township in Ghaziabad shares how they are making prayer arrangements at a golf course premise, within the integrated township that has a cemented pool. “Roughly 5,000 people will celebrate Chhath here. It’s usually more than 10,000, but we are trying to keep the attendance low this time, so that it doesn’t get congested. And gate pass is being issued to only those who are completely vaccinated. Plus firecrackers are strictly discouraged. We have also arranged for sanitiser and mask distribution at the venue, as well as a temperature gun. The number of women fasting is low enough to maintain social distancing within the pond. Yet 50 volunteers are being placed to ensure it happens smoothly, and we have requested for more police personnel,” adds Singh.

09-11-2021||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh polls: BSP panels recommend 18 names for nine seats of Prayagraj||After scrutiny of the biodatas of Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) ticket seekers for the 2022 UP assembly polls, the district, assembly constituency and main sector in-charge committees of the party have sent around 60 applications for 12 assembly seats of Prayagraj district to BSP chief Mayawati, say party office bearers.Besides, these committees in their report have also recommended the names of 18 prospective candidates for nine assembly seats of the district, they added. These nine seats are Phaphamau, Soraon, Handia, Meja, Karchhana, Allahabad West, Allahabad South, Bara and Koraon.Candidates for the remaining three assembly seats of Allahabad North, Phulpur and Pratappur are believed to have already been finalised by the party with two Brahmin and one Muslim faces, says a senior BSP leader privy to the information.Abhishek Gautam, the newly appointed BSP Prayagraj district unit president, confirmed that names of probable candidates had been sent to the party headquarters. “Now, our national president Mayawati ji and senior leaders will make a final call in this regard,” he added.Party insiders say the BSP chief was likely to meet the ticket seekers before putting the final seal on the names of the candidates and for which the party has started calling potential candidates to Lucknow for interview.Mayawati is expected to ask the ticket seekers about their political journey and their reason for considering them as a strong candidate for the party. They may also be asked about the works done by them in the constituency from where they wish to contest.Requesting anonymity, a senior BSP leader said it was expected that the party might come out with a list of candidates for select seats near November 15. However, he said, this time the party might delay naming candidates for many seats till close to election time so as to field worthy candidates while taking into account the candidates named by the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Samajwadi Party.If party leaders are to be believed, the BSP may field a leader of the Pal community from the Allahabad West seat to make up for its former MLA Puja Pal (who lost the elections from the seat in 2017 to BJP’s Sidharth Nath Singh) having left the party. On Allahabad West and Allahabad South seats, the BSP committees have forwarded names of three leaders each as potential candidates, including two Muslim leaders each on both seats. Party leaders claim that name of a Brahmin trader leader has already been finalised by the party to contest from Allahabad North seat.The most intense fight is for the seats of Pratappur and Soraon from where party’s sitting MLAs Mujtaba Siddiqui and Hakim Lal Bind (the only two seats that BSP could win in 2017 out of 12 in Prayagraj) have defected to the Samajwadi Party. Party leaders say while the BSP can field a Muslim face from Pratappur, it will be fielding a Brahmin leader from Handia seat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uttar-pradesh-polls-bsp-panels-recommend-18-names-for-nine-seats-of-prayagraj-101636474207796.html

According to Muzaffarpur senior superintendent of police (SSP) Jayant Kant, all the three deceased had consumed some spurious substances on November 7 and suffered from diarrhoea before they died. “While two of them died during treatment, the third died at home,” Kant said, adding that a fourth person is undergoing treatment.

The deceased have been identified as Ram Babu Rai (67), Dilip Rai (50) and Gopi Patel (30), residents of Kapurpura, Bariyarpur and Sirisiya villages, respectively, all falling under Kanti police station limits of Muzaffarpur district.Based on the feedback from the family members, Sanjay Rai, excise superintendent, Muzaffarpur, said, “They all were habitual consumers of toddy (tari).”Muzaffarpur district magistrate (DM) Pranav Kumar said, “Given the kind of reports pouring in from different quarters, the possibility of deaths occurring due to spurious liquor consumption could not be ruled out.

09-11-2021||Patna||Filmmakers from Bihar keen to shoot in state, want subsidy, easy nods||Filmmakers and television show producers with roots in Bihar have requested the state government to provide them subsidy for shooting their films in the state and expedite the process of approval for shooting at locations around monuments and heritage sites in the state, officials familiar with the matter said. This was discussed at a meeting held by the Bihar State Film Development and Finance Corporation ( BSFDFC), a part of state’s culture department, in state capital on November 2, which was attended many filmmakers hailing from the state. Bihar has produced many film personalities, including actors Manoj Bajpayee and Pankaj Triparthi, actor Kumkum of “Lagi Nahin Chhute Rama” fame, playback singer Rajkumari and lyricist Shaad Azeemabadi. Several Bollywood films have been shot in Bihar in the past, besides local Bhojpuri films. “But now, even Bhojpuri films are not shot here. Most of the shooting is done in Maharashtra and Gujarat because of the lack of infrastructure required for filmmaking in Bihar. Movies are being shot even in Jharkhand because of the provision of subsidy for shooting available there. But in our home state, we are still waiting for this,” says Vijay Pandey, an actor and director associated with several films and TV serials, including the soap opera Hum Paanch of the 1990s. Places like Rajgir, Nalanda and Vaishali have been some of the favourite locations for shooting Bhojpuri films. “But the support of subsidy is missing. We want the government to consider this to woo filmmakers,” Pandey said. Filmmakers are eager to come here. It’s only the lack of the support of subsidy, which is holding them back, he added. Kirankant Verma, who has made Devdas in Bhojpuri, said that provisions of subsidy apart, the Bihar government must ensure faster approvals. “Filmmakers need easy and fast no objection certificates for shooting around monuments and heritage sites. This certificate is issued by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). But it’s been quite time consuming here,” he said. Bandana Preyashi, secretary at the culture department, said the government has initiated many steps to revive film development and finance corporation. “It will seriously consider the proposal for the provision of subsidy for shooting films in the state,” she said. To ensure that filmmakers get the permission for shooting at locations near heritage sites and monuments easily, a meeting with the ASI will soon be held, she said. “We will take all steps to ensure filmmakers feel safe and secure here.” The culture secretary said two children’s film festivals have already been scheduled at Bihar Museum in the state capital on Children’s Day on November 13-14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/filmmakers-from-bihar-keen-to-shoot-in-state-want-subsidy-easy-nods-101636473247788.html

09-11-2021||Mumbai||Coastal road interchange navigation span sufficient: BMC||The navigation span under Coastal Road-Bandra Worli Sea Link interchange is sufficient, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said on Monday in response to Worli fisherfolks’ claims that the proposed navigation span being provided to them under the interchange – of 60 metres between supporting pillars – is insufficient. BMC maintained that it has consulted affected fisherfolk societies of Worli prior to obtaining a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the fisheries department, and coastal regulatory zone (CRZ) clearance from the Union environment ministry, for the project. This claim has been refuted by protesting fisherfolk.BMC in its statement referred to the Bureau of Indian Standards’ Code of Practice for Design of Ports and Harbours, which specifies that a “navigation span is required to be 5 times the width of the boat for single carriage and 8 times the width of the boat for double carriage.” Referring to data obtained from the fisheries department, BMC has said that the largest registered vessel operating in Worli koliwada is 3.8 metres wide, and accordingly the navigation span for boats operating from the koliwada “should be kept at a maximum of 30.4 meters for double carriage.”“The Mumbai Coastal Road Project has a navigation span of 60 meters, which is almost double prescribed the navigation span,” the BMC’s statement said. BMC also added that the Tata Institute of Social Sciences has been appointed to formulate a policy to compensate the fishermen for losses incurred during the construction of the project, and that “the process of fulfilling this demand has been started.”Fisherfolk, however, maintained that the two fishing societies of Worli were not consulted for their suggestions prior to obtaining the NOC from the fisheries department. They also stressed that their primary demand is a redesign of the interchange. “We have been raising this issue for many years, and compensation, though important, is not our main demand. We want to have free access to our traditional fishing grounds, whereas BMC’s current designs will force us to shut shop completely. If the BMC feels like they are providing us a larger enough navigation route, let them come and pilot our boats through the rocky seas first. Then they will know exactly why our demands are what they are,” said Nitesh Patil, president, Worli Koliwada Nakhava Matsyavyavsay Sahakari Sangathan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/coastal-road-interchange-navigation-span-sufficient-bmc-101636472648144.html
09-11-2021||Lucknow||Voters’ list revision: If needed, SP will stage sit-in protest against EC, says Akhilesh||LUCKNOW Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav on Tuesday said if needed his party will stage a sit-in protest against the Election Commission (in Lucknow and Delhi) over the issue of voters’ list revision for 2022 UP Assembly polls. “The EC has added over 21 lakh new names and removed over 16 lakh names in the UP voters’ list revision. This time, the EC has not given the list (of names included and struck off) to the political parties (to cross-check). Till 2019 Lok Sabha elections, EC gave the lists to the political parties, then why not this time?,” asked Akhilesh at a press conference at the SP office, which he called to talk about demonetisation on its fifth anniversary. The former chief minister said his party’s state president Naresh Uttam Patel, along with a party delegation, had met the chief election officer (CEO), UP, in this regard and gave him a memorandum. “We will give the memorandum at Delhi (EC) also, and if need be, sit on a dharna,” he said. Akhilesh also said: “Most of the officers posted in the EC, I understand, were sent from UP.” Before starting the press conference, Akhilesh Yadav celebrated the birthday of Khazanchi, the child who was born in a bank queue in Kanpur Dehat on December 2. The SP chief gave him several gifts including a bottle of ‘Samajwadi Itra (perfume)’. Akhilesh and his party celebrate Khazanchi’s birthday twice a year, every year, since the first anniversary of demonetisation. The child is often referred to as ‘demonetisation baby’ and he was named Khazanchi (treasurer) by the manager of the bank outside which the boy was born. Attacking the BJP on demonetisation, Akhilesh said: “It is the BJP that should celebrate Khazanchi’s birthday. Demonetisation was their gift to people to ruin the economy and businesses. The BJP has not been enumerating the benefits of demonetisation. Black money did not end, corruption rose, and corruption in UP rose unprecedentedly. The BJP had been telling people through TV channels that the new currency had a chip to check black money. Demonetisation did not end black money. Money itself is not black or white, it is the transactions that you or I do that are black or white. Demonetisation was done deliberately to trouble people.” Stating that the present “ruin in the economic condition” was created by the BJP, he said: “The masterstroke (demonetisation) turned out brain stroke.” Traders and businesses were ruined after the way demonetisation and GST were implemented, said Akhilesh.The former CM also displayed an empty cylinder and said: “This is empty and we did not get it refilled for it will expose the high price of the cylinder.” ‘BJP triple-engine govt will not let justice prevail’ Taking about the Lakhimpur Kheri case and the Supreme Court’s observation on it, Akhilesh said: “Today, SC also questioned the UP government over the case and made harsh observations. SC is saying that attempts were being made to save the guilty. Since the beginning, the SP had been saying that till the BJP is in power forget about justice in the Lakhimpur Kheri case. ‘BJP Triple engine’ government will not let justice happen. Triple engine--the BJP government in the state, the BJP government at the centre, and the BJP government of MoS (Ajay Mishra Teni whose son is the accused in the case). The MoS has not resigned even till now.” He said the SIT (special investigation team) is of the state government, it will do what the state government will tell it to do. He added: “That’s why I say, Baaees mein badlav hoga (there will be change in 2022) and justice will be done.” Talking about law and order in UP, Akhilesh said: “Look what happened in Fatehgarh jail. Inmates bashed up jailers and other officers and staff.” SAMAJWADI PERFUME SP national president Akhilesh Yadav also launched a perfume ‘Samajwadi Itra (perfume)’ produced by an SP MLC Pushpraj Jain. “The perfume will end hatred in 2022,” said Jain. The perfume bottle and box are red and green (in Samajwadi Party colours) while the carton also has a picture of Akhilesh Yadav. Akhilesh said: “The perfume will spread the fragrance of SP government’s development works and party’s development agenda.” ASKS SP MLA TO END FAST SP chief Akhilesh Yadav also made an appeal to the SP Gauriganj MLA to end his fast and rather eat well, get strong and fight against the BJP government. “It is my appeal to the MLA to end the fast. Why fast against the blind and deaf BJP government. Instead, eat well, get strong and fight the BJP government to oust it,” Akhilesh said and added that party leaders led by leader of opposition Ramgovind Chaudhary will meet the MLA asking him to end the fast. SP MLA Rakesh Pratap Singh is on fast since October 31 and late last week the police picked him up and admitted him to the Civil hospital (Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Hospital) on Saturday afternoon. Singh had been on hunger strike since October 31, the day he submitted his resignation from his Vidhan Sabha membership to the Speaker of UP Assembly, HN Dixit, saying that the BJP government was not cooperating in some road construction work in his constituency Gauriganj (Amethi).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/voters-list-revision-if-needed-sp-will-stage-sit-in-protest-against-ec-says-akhilesh-101636472589460.html
09-11-2021||Patna||Sudha milk to get dearer by ₹2-4 more from Nov 11||The Bihar State Milk Cooperative Federation Limited (Comfed) on Tuesday announced a hike in price of all its milk variants by ₹2 to ₹ 4per litre with effect from November 11. The Comfed, which sells milk and dairy products under Sudha brand, attributed the hike to increase in fodder price, input and operational cost.Comfed had last increased the consumer price of milk in February this year.Sudha full cream milk will now cost ₹56 per litre in place of ₹52. Standard milk will be sold for ₹49/L, cow milk ₹46/L and toned milk ₹44/L while double toned will be priced at ₹40/L. Prices of Sudha’s milk products like paneer, gulabjamun, milk cake and balusahi will also increase by up to ₹4. However, there will be no change in rates of ghee, lassi, curd, butter and flavoured milk.“The rates of different types of Sudha’s packet milk has been increased by an average of ₹3 per litre except for full cream milk which has been increased by ₹4 per litre”, said V Pandey, Comfed’s information and public relations officer.“The prices have been increased owing to rise in the prices of green and dry fodder after floods so that milk producers can get maximum amount for their supplies. Input prices for materials like feed, fodder, medicines have increased and therefore production cost of milk for farmers is no more remunerative, leading to their diminishing interest in animal husbandry,” Pandey said, adding that there has also been an increase in various operational costs such as rates of electricity, petroleum, polythene films and manpower cost.Taking a dig at the state government, Congress leader Prem Chandra Mishra linked the hike in milk price with the reduction in fuel prices. “In Bihar, the government increased prices of Sudha milk by ₹3 to 4 per litre and increased inflation and additional burden on common people. Nitish Kumar has offset the reduction in tax by ₹2- 3 on petrol and diesel by increasing the price of milk,” he tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/sudha-milk-to-get-dearer-by-2-4-more-from-nov-11-101636472587791.html

Further, as the firefighting equipment in the society was not in proper working condition, a show-cause notice was issued to concerned stakeholders.”Meanwhile, the investigation into the final report will be concluded by a committee formed under the additional municipal commissioner of the BMC in the coming days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/avighna-park-fire-short-circuit-is-primary-cause-exact-cause-being-probed-says-mfb-report-101636471747752.html
09-11-2021||Lucknow||Yogi hits out at SP over ‘khaandan politics’||LUCKNOW UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday launched a scathing attack on the Samajwadi Party (SP) over its “dynastic politics”, saying members of one particular family fanned out to do extortion in job recruitments during the previous government’s tenure. But now all the job processes were transparent and the present government gave 4.5 lakh jobs to youths in 4.5 years of its tenure, he said.“In the khaandan, there was no relation that did not remind one of the Mahabharat – there were chachas, mamas, kakas, nanas, bhanjas, bhatijas, or babua,” said Yogi Adityanath at a government event in Badaun for the inauguration and foundation laying of projects worth ₹1,400 crore for the district.“The previous government’s interest was only in its khaandan (Yadav family). They were always busy in how the khaandan members make money, invest in foreign countries, buy islands in foreign countries and be safe and secure themselves,” he said.The chief minister said: “What was the condition of UP before 2017? It had the worst law and order. Every second or third day, riots happened somewhere in the state. No festival and celebrations could happen in peace. Anarchy ruled. But now people celebrated Diwali peacefully. But earlier, festivals were celebrated under curfews. After 2017, you have not seen any riots happen.”“Remember what happened first when the SP government came to power in 2012? Riots in Kosi Kalan, then Bareilly, Muzaffarnagar, Lucknow and Kanpur riots. No district was devoid of riots. When the previous government came, it did not do anything for youth, women, farmers and the poor. It withdrew cases against terrorists who carried out an attack on Ramjanmabhoomi in Ayodhya. The previous government used to withdraw cases on terrorists and rioters were called to the CM’s office and felicitated. But our government sends terrorists to their ‘world’,” added Yogi Adityanath.Yogi said when the BJP government came in UP in 2017, the first thing it did was the formation of anti-Romeo squads for women safety, then farm loan waiver, and then it shut down illegal slaughter houses. “Cow smuggling and illegal slaughterhouses were the order of the day. But now it’s cow conservation and gau sewa,” he added. “Before 2017, whenever the central government’s development index survey reports came, UP was always at the bottom of the list. But now, UP either gets number one or number two spot in these surveys,” he said.“For the previous government, khaandan was the state, for PM Modi 130 crore people of the country is family, and for us 25 crore people of the state are family,” said Yogi Adityanath.Later in the day, Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav, at a press in Lucknow, said: “Ab woh apney khaandan ke paas jayein. Now it’s time for him to go to his khaandan as it was time for his departure.” ‘MAKE BJP WIN EVEN SAHASWAN’Addressing people at the Badaun event, chief minister Yogi Adityanath said: “In 2017, people made BJP win five of the six Badaun assembly constituencies. This time, also make the BJP win the Sahaswan constituency. Badaun has a BJP MP, it has a BJP zila panchayat president and has five of six MLAs. Sahaswan will get more development once MP and MLA are of the BJP.”SPECULATION OVER NAME CHANGE OF BADAUNChief minister Yogi Adityanath said in ancient times Badaun was known as Vedamau and it was a centre of studies of the Vedas. The statement triggered speculations over the district’s name change. “Once upon a time, Badaun was known as Vedamau. It was known as a centre of studies of the Vedas. It is also said that Maharaj Bhagirath, whose efforts brought river Ganga on the earth, had meditated here. Ganga, for thousands of years, has been providing the most fertile soil. The fertile soil brought by Ganga and Yamuna cannot be found anywhere else in the world.” According to religious scriptures, Bhagirath, a king of the legends, had brought the Ganga (personified as a goddess) to earth from the heavens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/yogi-hits-out-at-sp-over-khaandan-politics-101636471687837.html

We gave him a memorandum. The Governor assured us that everything will be fine," Wankhede’s father Dhyandev Kachruji Wankhede, told reporters after leaving the governor’s residence.Wankhede’s wife Kranti Redkar told reporters that the family needs “strength” and they met the governor to brief him on everything that has happened so far. We told the Gov everything - everything happening with us. It was not as if we went to him with a complaint. We just told him that it's a fight for truth and we're going to fight, we just need strength,” ANI said quoting Redkar.Redkar also said that the governor asked the family to be patient, and assured them of truth prevailing in the end.“He asked us to observe restraint and have patience, saying that truth shall prevail. We got a lot of positivity after meeting him," she told PTI.Dhyandev has also filed a defamation suit against Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik in Bombay high court, accusing him of causing “irreparable loss, damage, harm, prejudice to the name, character, reputation and societal image of plaintiff and his family members”. The lawsuit also seeks a compensation of ₹1.25 crore in damages.Malik, a Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader, has levelled serious allegations against Wankhede, accusing him of obtaining a fraudulent caste certificate to secure his job and extortion. Wankhede, who was in-charge of the cruise drugs bust case involving Bollywood actor Aryan Khan, was removed from the case, and the agency also initiated a vigilance probe against him.Malik had also alleged Wankhede’s sister-in-law Harshada Dinanath Redkar of being involved in drugs related business dealings. “Sameer Dawood Wankhede, is your sister-in-law Harshada Dinanath Redkar involved in the drug business ? You must answer because her case is pending before the Pune court,” Malik tweeted on Monday with a screenshot of a case registered on January 14, 2008, under Section 3458 of the Prevention of Illicit Traffic in Narcotics Drugs And Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sameer-wankhede-s-father-meets-maharashtra-governor-with-wife-and-daughter-in-tow-101636471144799.html
09-11-2021||Other||After 2 legislators, another Manipur MLA announces joining BJP||Close on the heels of two legislators joining the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ahead of assembly elections, another legislator from Manipur, elected on a Lok Janshakti Party ticket in state assembly elections in 2017, also announced that he will join the BJP on November 11. Manipur is due for assembly elections early next year.MLA Karam Shyam who represents Langthabal assembly constituency in Imphal West District made the announcement while speaking to reporters at his residence at Chajing Mairenkhong in Imphal West District on Monday.Terming the “grassroot” initiatives taken up by Prime Minister Narendra Modi as remarkable, former cabinet minister Shyam said, “As I have no party or flag, I have decided to join BJP and I will take a bigger responsibility to make BJP a successful and powerful party in future.”On Monday, two Manipur legislators - RK Imo Singh, who represents the Sagolband constituency in Imphal West district, and Yamthong Haokip, who was elected from the Saikul assembly segment in Kangpokpi district - joined the BJP in presence of party leaders in the national capital.Both Imo and Haokip were elected on a Congress ticket in the 2017 assembly elections. Imo was expelled from the Congress in August last year for anti-party activities while Yamthong was still with Congress before he joined BJP on Monday.With Monday’s political development, the Congress, which won a total of 28 seats to emerge as the single largest party in the 60-member Manipur house after the 2017 polls, is down to 15 legislators in the assembly. On the other hand, the ruling BJP’s strength in the assembly has gone up to 25. But the state assembly is yet to make an official version in this regard. It may be mentioned that the former Congress legislators started to join BJP in August last year after five Congress MLAs joined the party. It was followed by the former state Congress unit chief Govindas Konthoujam on August 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/after-2-legislators-another-manipur-mla-announces-joining-bjp-101636471087619.html

As per the police, Ajay Sharma, 35, Prayagraj district vice president of BJP Kisan Morcha, suffered five bullet wounds and was rushed to Swaroop Rani Nehru Hospital from where he was later shifted to a private hospital.

On the basis of his complaint, a First Information Report (FIR) was registered against the unidentified assailants. Senior superintendent of police, Prayagraj, Sarvashreshtha Tripathi said the condition of Ajay Sharma was now out of danger. “Preliminary investigations suggest that the attack may be the fallout of a property related dispute. However, all angles are under investigation. Ajay has not named anyone yet and informed police that the assailants had their faces covered. Police are yet to receive a written complaint in this connection,” he added.Circle officer, Soraon, Sudhir Kumar said many empty cartridges were recovered from the site of the crime.

09-11-2021||Kolkata||BJP moves court after election body okays Kolkata, Howrah civic polls on Dec 19||KOLKATA: The West Bengal State Election Commission on Tuesday accepted the state government’s proposal to hold civic body elections in Kolkata and Howrah on December 19, prompting the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to rush to the Calcutta high court with a petition that wants the court to order simultaneous elections in all civic bodies in Bengal in February next year.Holding local polls in phases has no logic and can be termed illegal, the petition said, arguing that elections to the Kolkata and Howrah civic bodies also should be held in February else it will deprive about 2 million first-time voters expected to be enrolled in January from exercising their franchise.The five-year term of elected representatives who run West Bengal’s 120-odd municipalities and corporations ended over the last two years. Elections were scheduled to be held last year but were postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic.On Tuesday, the state election commission, which is mandated to conduct panchayat and civic body elections, conveyed its decision to accept the Trinamool Congress (TMC) government’s proposal to hold elections to the Kolkata and Howrah municipal corporations on December 19.Not all wards of the existing Howrah corporation will get to vote since the Mamata Banerjee government has decided to carve another corporation from Howrah’s Bally area.“The cabinet today decided to delink Bally from the Howrah municipal corporation. A formal proposal will be placed before the legislative assembly this week,” parliamentary affairs minister Partha Chatterjee said. Chatterjee brushed aside the BJP protests and its petition in the high court, insisting that the opposition party moved court because it was afraid of losing the civic polls after the debacle in the assembly elections this year and the recent bypolls. The Trinamool Congress won the four seats that voted in the October 30 bypoll.“The BJP did not say a word when the Election Commission of India decided to hold the assembly polls in eight phases in March-April,” said Chatterjee, a reference to the back-and-forth between the BJP and Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress over the assembly election schedule.BJP state vice-president Jay Prakash Majumdar shot back: “The TMC did not hesitate to take part in the state polls during a pandemic. Festivals have also been held. What is stopping the government from holding all civic polls on a single day?”Majumdar said the BJP demanded that the polls be held in February because the new voters’ list will be published on January 5. “According to our estimate, around two million new names are likely to be added. It will take at least 15 days to include these names in the local voter charts. Why should so many young voters be deprived?” Majumdar told HT.Administrative officers from Kolkata and Howrah have been asked to attend a meeting at the state election commission’s office on November 12, officials said.Opposition parties, especially the BJP, have been demanding polls in the civic bodies saying these were indefinitely postponed by the government for political reasons. After the tenure of the boards ended, the government appointed members of the existing boards as administrative heads. At the 145-year-old Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC), for example, cabinet minister Firhad Hakim was made chairman of the board of administrators after his tenure as mayor ended. TMC earlier had an absolute majority in the KMC board.Congress state president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said, “I am not concerned about when the polls will be held. I am keen to know if it will be free and fair because, in earlier polls, many people were not allowed to file nomination and voters faced intimidation from the ruling party.”CPI(M) central committee member Sujan Chakraborty said, “We have been demanding these polls for two years. We want to know who will audit the expenditure made by the administrative bodies during this interim period. We are quite sure public money was squandered.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bjp-moves-court-after-election-body-okays-kolkata-howrah-civic-polls-on-dec-19-101636470187819.html
09-11-2021||Mumbai||Eating out to burn a hole in your pockets: Hoteliers may hike prices by 20%||Eating out may get costlier as restaurant owners are all set to hike prices of eatables by at least 20% in the next few days.Massive hike in commercial Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) cylinders, increased cost of vegetable and pulses, coupled with high labour cost have all added to the burden of running the establishments, the hoteliers say.The Indian Hotels and Restaurant Association (AHAR), a leading association of hoteliers said the hike is almost inevitable. “After almost 18 months of lockdown, we are running our businesses with very thin margins. However, the recent LPG cylinder hike of ₹266 has impacted us. An average restaurant needs a minimum of four LPG cylinders daily and it is impossible to sustain with such increase in prices,” said AHAR president Shivanand Shetty.According to The Indian Hotels and Restaurant Association (AHAR), the basic price of a dosa price will be ₹90 onwards, which is currently being priced at ₹75. Similarly, dal fry which now costs ₹130 will be charged at ₹160 and mixed vegetable dish is priced at ₹160 will be cost ₹190. The pav bhaji being sold at ₹120 will cost ₹145 onwards, after the hike.The oil companies announced the hike of commercial LPG cylinders by ₹226 last week. This means the 19kg cylinder would now cost ₹1,950 from ₹1,724. It was costed ₹1498 in July.Narayan Poojari, managing director, Shiv Sagar chain of hotels and partner in Mahesh Lunch Home, Fort, said, “Our establishment cost has gone through the roof and it is unfeasible to conduct business with the current rates. There is no way but to go for a hike,” said Poojari.The labour shortage has also added to the establishment cost. The hotel sector has been facing a massive labour shortage due to which they are forced to shell out more salaries to the existing staff.Satish Nayak, proprietor, Udupi Shri Krishna Boarding, which is one of the oldest restaurants in Mumbai, said they now operated with just half the staff (22 out of 44) post lockdown. “We have been forced to pay more to our existing staff to avoid poaching by other establishments. This has hugely added to our costs,” said Satish Nayak, proprietor.Some of the hotels, however, have decided to bear the additional burden for some more time. Mirah Hospitality, which runs 14 hotels including Rajdhani, Hitchki and Bayroute said though they are burdened with huge costs, they will not hike the prices. “After months of lockdown, we are now picking up and we are in no mood to increase our rates at this juncture. There is no doubt, the LPG cylinder hike has hit us severely, but then we cannot hike, as it could also translate to the loss of consumers. We will study this situation till the end of this year and then take a call on a price hike,” said Aji Nair, chief operating officer (food and beverages division), Mirah Hospitality.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/eating-out-to-burn-a-hole-in-your-pockets-hoteliers-may-hike-prices-by-20-101636469949441.html
09-11-2021||Mumbai||New eligibility criteria stumps B Arch aspirants, many call for extension of old rule||A day after the Maharashtra common entrance test (MH-CET) cell released the information brochure for admissions to various undergraduate (UG) and postgraduate (PG) professional courses, students aiming for Bachelor of Architecture (B Arch) seats are hoping for a miracle. Unaware of the changes made to the eligibility criteria for admissions to the course, many fear they will lose out on seats in top architecture colleges in the state. Until academic year 2020-21, B Arch aspirants were allowed to register using either their Joint Entrance Examination (JEE-Mains) or the National Aptitude Test in Architecture (NATA) scores. This year, however, a notification from the Council of Architecture (CoA) stated that JEE scores will only be acceptable for admissions to Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), National Institutes of Technology (NITs) and central universities, while all other institutes will accept NATA score only. As a result, for the past few days, many candidates have approached the state Directorate of Technical Education (DTE), seeking a year’s extension to the old eligibility criteria—allowing students to apply for admissions with their JEE score as well. “We have been directed by CoA to accept only NATA scores. Any change to the rule will therefore have to be approved by the same authority,” said a senior DTE official on the condition of anonymity. The parent of a B Arch student said, “While the information brochure shared by the admissions authority mentions that NATA score will be accepted, there’s no mention of the fact that scores of another equivalent exam like JEE will not be accepted this year onwards. What’s worse is that the information brochure was released two days ago, while students appeared for the entrance exams in February, March and April, mostly unaware of the fact that JEE scores will not be accepted during admission.” This year, JEE and NATA exams were held in multiple sessions, mainly to give students the option of choosing the best score out of the multiple sessions and at the same time, also giving them the option of a back session in case they missed the previous session due to Covid-related issues. “My daughter appeared for the first two sessions of NATA as well as two sessions of JEE. While she has scored 98 percentile in JEE, her NATA score is low. Until now, she was not worried because we were under the impression that JEE score will be applicable. Because of the change in the eligibility criteria, my daughter will lose a seat in a college of her choice,” said the father of another aspirant. Two weeks ago, the Madras high court (HC) gave interim relief two candidates who requested that they be allowed to participate in the counselling round for B Arch course at Anna University based on their JEE score for academic year 2021-22. Madras HC eventually directed the university to accept registrations from both candidates but clarified that the outcome, however, will be subject to the outcome of the students’ plea challenging the admission rule.MU to hold convocation on December 10After a break of one year, the University of Mumbai (MU) will host its annual convocation ceremony in the famed Convocation Hall at the Fort campus on December 10. Due to rising Covid-19 cases, the 2020 convocation ceremony was held virtually on February 1, 2021. “Degree/diploma certificates of students who have passed their examinations in the first and second half of 2021, before the day of the upcoming convocation, will be sent to the respective colleges. A list of available degree/diploma certificates with convocation numbers of the candidates will be made available on the varsity website soon,” said Vinod Patil, director, board of examination and evaluation, MU. Nearly two lakh students will be graduating this year, he added. After delaying their convocation ceremony in 2020, MU held the ceremony online in February where nearly 1.91 lakh students graduated and received certificates. This year, the varsity has clarified in advance that students should not gather at the ceremony looking for their certificates to maintain Covid-19 protocols. “In case of non-receipt of certificates or any error in the degree, a written complaint should be submitted in the examination department within one month of the convocation. We request students to not enquire or gather on convocation day as the certificates will be sent to their respective colleges,” added Patil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/new-eligibility-criteria-stumps-b-arch-aspirants-many-call-for-extension-of-old-rule-101636469947964.html

Workers from the Wakdewadi ST depot protested without wearing shirts in the morning. Similarly, workers from all 13 depots in Pune division stayed off work and no ST buses went on the roads.Meanwhile, private buses, school and company buses were allowed by the state government to transport passengers. Several private buses were operating from outside the ST stands in Pune, albeit with higher fares.“I came to Swargate as I had to go to Kolhapur, but as the strike is on, I took a private bus which cost ₹1,000. As there was no other option and my reaching Kolhapur was necessary I went by the private tourist bus,” said Aditya Mohite, a passenger. For the last 10 days, MSRTC workers and their unions are protesting various demands. A Kruti Samiti of unions was formed to have a conversation with the state government. Apparently the main demand of making the MSRTC a state government department was compromised according to workers, so now workers (apart from union members) have spontaneously started to strike from Sunday midnight. The Pune Regional Transport Office (RTO) deployed inspectors and other staff to monitor operations of private buses. “We took a meeting of our officers in the morning and accordingly, their were sent to various ST depots all across the Pune division to monitor these private buses,” said Pune Regional Transport Officer Ajit Shinde.Atmaram Sanap one of the protesting workers at the Wakdewadi depot said, “To convey our demands and help the state government realise our pain we protested without wearing shirts at the ST stand. The financial burden is too much. The state government should take immediate action and take in the organisation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/msrtc-workers-stage-protest-without-shirts-as-strike-gets-aggressive-101636469227696.html

Passengers trying to come back to Pune after the Diwali holidays are finding it difficult to book tickets with private bus operators.The post-Diwali rush to return to the city has also increased the demand for seats on private buses coming to Pune. The Bus and Car Operators Confederation of India (BOCI) has asked private bus operators not to overcharge passengers and take advantage of the situation. Harshada Nagle, a resident of Bavdhan, visited her native village in Akola for Diwali. Coming back to Pune is proving to be a challenge. “I was supposed to join office on Tuesday. I tried to book a ticket on a private bus but I was told that all the tickets are sold out for the next three days. The fares have also doubled. From Akola, tickets prices on private buses range from ₹1,000 to Rs1,200. Now it’s ₹2,000. I had to make travelling arrangements with a relative who coming by their own vehicle to Pune,” said Nagle.

09-11-2021||Mumbai||BMC proposes additional repairs to 5 skywalks in western suburbs||After the report submitted by an expert committee led by Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute (VJTI), the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has proposed repairs of skywalks at Borivli, Dahisar West and East, Goregaon and Kandivli (East). The skywalks in Mumbai were audited by the committee after the Himalaya Bridge collapsed at CSMT in March 2019.According to the proposal passed by the BMC’s standing committee on Tuesday, the proposal for repair cost has been increased to ₹21 crore from the ₹18 crore in 2019. The repair works will see the implementation of the recommendation by the committee.Satish Thosar, BMC’s chief engineer of the bridges department said, “The rise in cost is owing to a few recommendations that the committee had given, like using a corrosion-resistant paint, laying of fibre-reinforced polymer on the flooring, among others.”According to BMC officials, the repairs were proposed in the year 2019, but owing to the committee recommendations, a few more works needed to be taken up leading to the cost escalation.Apart from the above skywalks, more 23 skywalks are due to undergo major repairs or demolition and reconstruction.Meanwhile, the BMC has decided to demolish and rebuild part of the city’s first skywalk in Bandra (East). The decision has been taken by the BMC owing to structural defects pointed out by a third-party auditor. According to BMC officials, the stretch between Bandra East station and Western Express Highway will be demolished and rebuilt at the cost of around ₹16.20 crore.Meanwhile, the Opposition party leader in the BMC and Congress Corporator Ravi Raja, while discussing the repairs of the skywalk, in the meeting said that most of the skywalks constructed by the MMRDA and have now been handed over to the BMC for maintenance have become white elephants. Raja said, “We all know who uses these skywalks and how many commuters prefer to cross from the chaotic traffic-filled road below. This is because at many times there are either hawkers or some persons found to be sleeping on it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-proposes-additional-repairs-to-5-skywalks-in-western-suburbs-101636466887409.html

The vehicle turned out to be a tourist car, the police said.The driver was questioned and was let off after questioning as nothing suspicious was found from his interrogation, the police said.The Mumbai Police had on Monday intensified vigilance in south Mumbai, specifically, around Mukesh Ambani’s house Antilia, after a taxi driver informed the Azad Maidan police that suspicious men travelling in a Wagon R car had asked him the address of the industrialist. The driver also told police that the people looked suspicious and were carrying two bags.The registration number (of the vehicle) shared by the taxi driver was incorrect. Hence, the police scanned CCTV cameras and spotted the vehicle in the footage. It was later traced to Navi Mumbai.Questioning of its owner revealed that three people, who are into sand business, had come to Navi Mumbai from Kutch, Gujarat. They hired his Wagon R for visiting tourists places in Mumbai. But near Killa court car driver’s phone got switched off, so he could not use Google Maps. Hence, they asked another taxi driver about the address of Antilia. Thereafter, they visited other tourist places and returned to Navi Mumbai. From there the businessmen left for Gujarat the same night, the police said.“The Wagon R driver narrated everything to us and also shared details of the three businessmen. We verified his claims and also spoke to them over the phone and prima-facie nothing suspicious was found,” said Bhushan Belnekar, senior inspector of Azad Maidan police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/tourists-asking-for-directions-no-threat-to-mukesh-ambani-s-residence-antilia-mumbai-police-101636465867541.html
09-11-2021||Kolkata||Former Bengal minister Amit Mitra appointed principal chief advisor to Mamata Banerjee, state finance dept||Former West Bengal finance minister Amit Mitra has been appointed as the principal chief advisor to chief minister Mamata Banerjee and the finance department, the state government announced on Tuesday.The six-month tenure of Mitra as the finance minister came to an end last week and since he did not contest the bypolls his department went under the control of the chief minister. An economist by profession, Mitra expressed his inability to continue as the finance minister owing to his fragile health.Mitra did not contest the assembly elections but was sworn-in as the finance minister for the third consecutive term in May this year, when the Trinamool Congress formed the government in Bengal. He was handpicked by Banerjee who had prepared a list of 24 cabinet ministers and 19 ministers of state after the elections.Mitra, a former secretary general of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), contested and won the assembly elections from Khardah in North 24 Parganas for two consecutive terms. “With the party winning 213 seats in May, Mitra could have contested and emerged as a winner from any seat, including Khardah which he earlier held. Mamata Banerjee, too, had to contest again from Bhabanipur constituency in September, as she lost from Nandigram in East Midnapore district. Finding two seats for them is not a big issue,” a top TMC leader told HT after the elections concluded.Banerjee holds the portfolios of finance, home, health, personnel and administrative reforms. In the latest reshuffle Chandrima Bhattacharya was appointed the minister of state for finance, and Pulak Roy was appointed as the new panchayat and rural development minister after the death of Trinamool Congress veteran Subrata Mukherjee.Manas Bhuiya, the state water resource development minister, was also given the additional charge of consumer affairs, which was under veteran leader Sadhan Pande, who is currently undergoing treatment for an ailment in Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/former-bengal-minister-amit-mitra-appointed-principal-chief-advisor-to-mamata-banerjee-state-finance-dept-101636465559231.html

Of the inoculation numbers, 6,80,28,164 residents have been administered the first dose while the number of people who have received both doses is 3,20,37,073.Dr Rahul Pandit, Director-critical care, Fortis Hospitals and member, National Covid-19 task force described the feat as a milestone. “This accomplishment is a fruition of tremendous hard work, strategic acumen and timely intervention by the state and civic authorities, governing bodies, healthcare workers, community caregivers and responsible citizens. However, we must not let our guards down,” said Dr Pandit.Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray last week set the target of completing 100% vaccination of its 91.44 million targetted population with the first dose by November 30.Maharashtra, which started the vaccination drive on January 16, has inoculated 68.02 million till Tuesday which is 74.38% of the targetted beneficiaries. Of them, 32.03 million people in the state have been fully vaccinated.The state achieved the target of 90 million doses on October 13, while it crossed 50 million mark on August 17. On July 20, it crossed 40 million mark and 10 million mark was achieved on April 11.The state government has attributed the slow start to initial hiccups in the vaccination drive due to the shortage of doses and the lower allocation of vaccines for the state. These issues were later sorted out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-crosses-100-million-milestone-in-its-covid-19-vaccine-drive-101636464367322.html
09-11-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra joins UN-backed ‘Race to Resilience’ climate campaign||State environment minister Aaditya Thackeray, in an interview to COP TV (an arm of COP 26), announced that Maharashtra has joined the United Nations (UN)-backed ‘Race to Resilience’ campaign, which aims to facilitate sub-national governments globally in developing climate-resilient infrastructures to protect those who are most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. It is a sister concern of the ‘Race to Zero’ campaign, which facilitates sub-national governments to reach ‘net zero’, or carbon neutrality. This move is significant, according to officials in the environment department, in light of Maharashtra’s expenses toward climate rehabilitation over the past one year alone. The state government has incurred losses worth 2 billion USD, paid as direct compensation for people and parties impacted by extreme weather events such a flood, drought and crop failures. “Race to Resilience focuses on helping the most vulnerable, frontline communities to build resilience and adapt to the physical impacts of climate change, such as extreme heat, drought, flooding and sea-level rise, in three area types: urban, rural and coastal,” the Maharashtra environment department said in a statement issued on Tuesday, giving examples of the state’s efforts towards building climate resilience. Among the efforts listed include the environment department’s Majhi Vasundhara Abhiyan, which “aims to achieve climate resilience in the state by bringing together local administrations, businesses, NGOs (non-governmental organisations), and citizens of all age groups” and “to incentivise all levels of local government to act on climate change mitigation and adaptation”. Under the programme, ₹55 crore was distributed in 2020-2021 between five urban local bodies which had performed well under the campaign. The other two examples include the conservation of mangroves in the state and the World Bank’s project on climate-resilient agriculture, which is underway in rural Maharashtra. “As India’s most industrialised state, Maharashtra is a crucial voice in building climate resilience in the Global South. By joining the Race to Resilience, Maharashtra aims to be a leading example for regional governments,” Thackeray said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-joins-un-backed-race-to-resilience-climate-campaign-101636464187437.html
09-11-2021||Mumbai||Extortion case against Param Bir Singh: 2 arrested cops sent to CID custody||A magistrate court on Tuesday sent the two arrested police officers to the custody of the Maharashtra crime investigation department (CID), which has arrested them in the ₹20 crore extortion case related to the former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh. The CID has also applied before the court, seeking the issuance of a non-bailable warrant (NBW) against the former top cop who has already two NBWs issued against him.Police inspectors - Nandkumar Gopale, who is currently posted with the police training centre in Khandala, and Asha Korke, posted at local arms in Naigaon - were named as co-accused along with Singh in the first information report (FIR) registered by the Marine Drive police on the complaint of Bhayander-based developer Shyamsunder Agrawal. There are at least three other police personnel, including a deputy commissioner of police (DCP)-rank officer, who are named as accused in the case.Gopale has been an ace investigator of Mumbai police. He played a key role in many high-profile cases in past including the IPL betting case, the Indian Mujahideen case and the journalist J Dey murder case. The CID in a statement said that after collecting evidence, it arrested Gopale and Korke on Monday and would produce them in a local court in Mumbai on Tuesday.Special public prosecutor Shekhar Jagtap said that the accused officers allegedly extorted cash worth ₹50 lakh through a hawala operator from Sharad Agrawal, the nephew of the complainant, by threatening to arrest his uncle in a false case. Hawala operator, Momin, is an old associate of Sanjay Punamiya, one of the accused in the case and Agarwal’s ex-business partner, Jagtap said.“The CID officers have established the link between the arrested officers, hawala operator and the main accused Punamiya. The CID has obtained scientific evidence against the two officers that indicated that they have accepted ₹50 lakh in cash,” Jagtap added.The CID is probing an FIR filed on Agrawal’s complaint at the Marine Drive police station. Agrawal had alleged that early this year, Juhu police filed an extortion case, accusing him of having links with underworld don Chhota Shakeel. Later, the police applied the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) in the case. Agrawal claimed that based on this false case, Singh and his subordinates extorted money from him at the behest of Punamiya, who is the main accused in the case.A few days later, Gopale, who was then Mumbai crime branch unit 9 in-charge, raided Agrawal’s Bhayander and Vile Parle residences. During these raids, the accused police officers illegally seized some partnership documents and other papers without making any official entry. Later, the photocopies of these documents were found in Punamiya’s possession, stated the FIR filed by Marine Drive police.Singh is wanted by multiple law enforcement agencies and the CID is probing at least three of the five FIRs filed against him.“There have already been two non-bailable warrants issued against Singh. On Tuesday, we urged the court to issue NBW in this case as well,” said Jagtap.A look-out circular (LoC) has also been issued against the former Mumbai Police chief. Apart from this, two open inquiries have also been initiated against the 1988-batch senior Indian Police Service (IPS) officer by the state anti-corruption bureau (ACB) over the corruption allegations made against him by two serving police inspectors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/extortion-case-against-param-bir-singh-2-arrested-cops-sent-to-cid-custody-101636461255663.html

The protestors carried tax bills and set them ablaze in front of the KDMC headquarters. The representative also placed a demand to remove these villages from the civic body, due to lack of development. The 27 villages which were under the grampanchayat rule earlier, were added to the civic body in June 2015. The union has sent several letters to the civic body asking to revise the tax amount. “Since after the villages were added into the civic body there is no development in these villages by the civic body, however, the tax charged is 10 times more than what we paid to the grampanchayat. We want the civic body to revise it and reduce the tax amount,” said Gulab Vaze, representative of the all-party union. Vinay Kulkarni, in-charge of the tax department of KDMC said, “Excluding these villages from the civic body is a matter pertaining to the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, the tax imposed on these villages is as similar to other parts of KDMC as these villages are now a part of the civic body. I have explained this to the representatives followed by which the protest was called off.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/village-representatives-in-kalyan-set-ablaze-tax-bills-complain-of-lack-of-development-101636460228288.html

09-11-2021||Chandigarh||Search for an emergency light ends in warm glow||Dust storms pummel Punjab frequently in May and June. They leave behind a trail of uprooted trees and electricity poles. The resulting power outages leave people fuming. During a stormy night in May, the electricity as usual, enacted the vanishing trick and our inverter battery also went kaput after its flickeringly moody, five-hour grudging generosity. Without electricity, it was a long buzzing night of mosquitoes. My wife reminded me of the need to have an emergency light in our home. I knew I had a task on my hands the next morning; I had to look for an emergency light first thing after waking up. Feeling groggy, I dragged myself to a neighbourhood electric goods shop in the morning. Spoiled for choice by retail showrooms, I was disappointed to find only four varieties of emergency light at the shop. When I complained to the young shop owner about the limited options, he replied apologetically, “Uncle, we don’t keep emergency lights because there’s hardly any demand. If you want a wider choice, search online. I’m sorry.” On reaching home, I plunged straight into the net. It turned out to be a maddening experience. One link led to another and I was bamboozled by the bewildering variety of emergency lights, all up for grabs! There were emergency lights that doubled as torches, some were equipped with a siren, and some others were solar-powered. I came across one that was equipped with a dynamo; you just shake it to charge it. Very inviting indeed, but since it happened to be a Chinese product, I dropped the idea. Who knows, if it was manufactured in Wuhan? After experiencing the freedom of choice and thrill that an itinerant window-shopper enjoys in the immense virtual mall, I realised that with so many sellers around, perhaps everyone was looking for an emergency light like me. Each model came with the promise of happiness, of dispelling darkness better than its competitors. Unable to decide which one to buy from the vast array, I gave up in exasperation. All were objects of desire and I wanted all or none. It was a case of a window-shopper’s delight giving way to a strange predicament summed up beautifully by Rajesh Reddy in this couplet: “Dil hai ik zidd pe adaa hai kisi bachey ki tarah/ Ya to sab kuchh hi isay chahiye ya kuchh bhi nahin (The heart, stubborn like a child/Yearns for everything or nothing).” As the day wore on, I was still undecided and worrying about the approaching night. The eventide was ominous as the deep blue sky disappeared behind dark thunderheads presaging a stormy night once again. The wind that began as a whisper had turned into a gust, and before long it was a gale. I looked sheepishly at my wife. She knew what I was feeling. But she smiled reassuringly and said, “You don’t have to worry. I’ve found an heirloom in the store.” She put on the table an old brass wick lamp with a sparkling glass chimney. My mother used to light it with desi ghee when I was a kid. “This is our emergency light,” she said. There it stood, ready to dispel darkness and gloom with its warm glow, redolence of abiding family love and heart-warming childhood memories! Provisioning happiness at short notice has been her speciality; our family’s emergency light spreading cheer since the day she became my life. swarajraj@yahoo.com The writer is a retired professor of English in Patiala||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/search-for-an-emergency-light-ends-in-warm-glow-101636458726965.html

Now, they (BJP) want the states to reduce the VAT. Where will the states get their money from?” Banerjee said during an assembly session.For the past few days, the West Bengal government and the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the state have engaged in a squabble after the Centre announced a reduction in central levies on petrol by ₹5 a litre and diesel by ₹10 a litre.Banerjee said on Tuesday that the VAT on petrol and diesel was reduced by the BJP-led Centre in view of the upcoming elections in five states. She alleged that prices will increase once the elections are over."Those lecturing us on oil prices should first answer where the state government will get its money from. The Union government does not give us our due funds," the Bengal CM further said in a direct attack to the BJP, which has already launched state-wide rallies for demanding a reduction in VAT.The saffron party has threatened to launch a much bigger movement next week if the ruling TMC fails to slash tax on fuel prices."The protests will assume such a proportion that the voice of the people will reach the chief minister's office on the 14th floor of state secretariat Nabanna. The protests will force her (Mamata) to listen to the just demand of people and match the Narendra Modi government's decision to cut excise duty on petrol and diesel...," BJP state unit chief Sukanta Majumder told reporters on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/centre-reduced-vat-on-fuel-in-view-of-upcoming-assembly-polls-mamata-banerjee-101636454777291.html

Don't intend to enter into alliance with any party,” news agency ANI quoted Mayawati as saying on Tuesday, while addressing a press conference in Lucknow.The BSP chief then took a swipe at the Congress and the Samajwadi Party, saying people will not trust several poll promises made by two parties.“Had Congress fulfilled even 50% of their poll promises they wouldn't have been out of power at the Centre, UP & in most of the states of the nation,” Mayawati said, intensifying her attack against the Congress.Also read | Protests in Delhi, Lucknow if concerns over voters list revision not addressed: AkhileshAhead of the upcoming UP polls, the rival parties and the BJP have begun their “drama” to “lure” people of the state, Mayawati claimed. “The truth is that BJP govt's, at the Centre & state, announcement of projects & inauguration of incomplete works in last 1.5-2 months will continue until polls,” Mayawati was further quoted as saying.The BSP leader further linkened the Akhilesh Yadav's Samajwadi Party with the Bharatiya Janata Party, claiming both parties rely on ‘Hindu-Muslim’ politics to get votes. Mayawati exuded confidence in her party's victory in the state with an absolute majority.“We don't see any difference between SP and BJP. They are two sides of the same coin.

With this, more than 30 lives have been lost in a fortnight for consumption of hooch in a state that is officially dry."While two of them succumbed to death during the treatment, one died at home," said Jayant Kant, senior superintendent of police, Muzaffarpur. The official also said one person is undergoing treatment as they fell ill after consuming spurious liquor. “The bodies have been taken for post mortem. We are recording the statements of bereaved family members as well as those who have been hospitalised. Based on the statements, we will be able to confirm whether liquor was consumed," the SSP further said.The incident took place close to the Saraiya police station area where five persons had died after consuming spurious liquor in the last week of October.Recently, hooch tragedies were reported in West Champaran, Gopalganj and Samastipur districts around Diwali, accounting to about 40 deaths, reported news agency PTI.The Muzaffarpur SSP further said police have launched a major crackdown on traders in Saraiya who were suspected of manufacturing illicit liquor.Sale and consumption of alcohol was completely banned in Bihar by the Nitish Kumar-led state government five and a half years ago.Meanwhile, Kumar has convened a high-level meeting over the liquor ban and hooch tragedies on November 16.Addressing reporters on Monday, the chief minister said, "We have called a high-level meeting over the situation of liquor ban on November 16. During the meeting, we will analyse where we are lacking in implementing the complete prohibition law in the state and we will take further decisions accordingly."Referring to the recent deaths, the CM said, "This happens because people are involved in the illegal business of selling liquor. We will sit on November 16 and list out the reason for such deaths. The government requests opposition leaders, other officials and individuals to inform us about the production of such spurious liquor in the state. The government would initiate action against such people."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/hooch-tragedy-two-persons-die-in-dry-bihar-s-muzaffarpur-district-101636451691746.html

The accused, a driver who earlier lived in the same house in West Sant Nagar before being evicted, was arrested from the locality after confessing to committing the murder by “strangulation and electrocution”, when cops patrolling the area found him in a suspicious state and confronted him.The accused, identified by police as Rakesh, referred to the murdered woman during his confession as his “sister-in-law”, the police said.The victim and the assistant professor at DU’s Ramjas College got married in February.Police said the driver killed the woman because he had a grudge against her over several reasons. He said he was upset, according to the police, because the woman had evicted him and his family from the house; and also she allegedly asked him return a Wagon R taxi that he was using to earn his livelihood.Also Read: Murder on PU campus: Victim’s brother wants police to verify husband’s claimsThe accused also claimed he was enraged because the DU teacher hadn’t been clearing some payments due to him.The plot, however, took a different turn when the murdered woman’s family members said they suspected her husband’s role in the killing. The victim’s family members said they had filed a complaint at Burari police station back in August, seeking police protection for her as they feared her in-laws and driver Rakesh could be plotting to kill her. “We are looking into the [family’s] allegations,” said a senior police officer.Deputy commissioner of police (north) Sagar Singh Kalsi said, “Rakesh held the woman responsible for becoming unemployed also for evicting him from the house. He… planned to take revenge. He killed her when her husband and mother-in-law were out for some work. The [murdered] woman’s 84-year-old bed-ridden father-in-law was at home, but he didn’t hear anything as he’s hearing-impaired.”The police were waiting for the autopsy report to confirm the exact cause of death.

09-11-2021||Jaipur||Need further cut in petrol, diesel excise duty: Rajasthan CM Gehlot to PM Modi||Amid pressure from all corners to cut value-added tax (VAT) on petrol and diesel, Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Tuesday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to slash central excise duty by a further ₹10 per litre on petrol and ₹15 per litre on diesel, saying that there was scope for the Centre to further bring down taxes on fuels. Gehlot also urged the government to stop oil companies from repeatedly increasing the prices of petrol and diesel. The Rajasthan CM’s letter to PM Modi comes two days after he wrote to union home minister Amit Shah, voicing similar concerns. In his letter to Modi, Gehlot pointed out that GST worth ₹5,963 crore was yet to be reimbursed by the Centre. He also wrote that the state was bearing a loss of ₹2,800 crore for reducing VAT in January 2021.Last week, the Centre slashed excise duties on petrol and diesel by ₹5 and ₹10 per litre, respectively. Also Read: 10 non-BJP states yet to cut VAT on petrol, diesel. Here’s what they say“To give complete relief to the public, the additional excise duty and the special excise duty of the central pool on petrol and diesel should be further reduced by the GoI (government of India). This would ensure that the common man gets the benefit of reduction in excise duty and VAT simultaneously,” wrote Gehlot. “We expect that the central government should reduce the excise duty by an additional ₹10 per litre on petrol and an additional ₹15 per litre on diesel. On reducing the excise duty… VAT of the state will also automatically reduce proportionately by ₹3.4 per litre on petrol and ₹3.9 per litre on diesel,” he wrote in the letter. “As a result, there will be an additional loss of ₹3,500 crore per annum in the revenue of the state, which the state government is ready to bear in the public interest.” CM Gehlot said that from 2016, the basic excise duty levied on petrol and diesel by the central government has been reduced, which was shared by the states, but special and additional excise duty has been continuously going up - of which the states don’t get any share. “The continuous reduction in the share of the states is against the principles of fiscal federalism,” Gehlot argued in his letter to Modi. The Rajasthan chief minister said that in democracy, elected governments should mobilise necessary financial resources for development and social security schemes of the state. The geographical location, economic scenario and local conditions of each of the states also have roles in shaping how the benefits of development plans reach the public, he explained. Under some circumstances, state governments have the right - given by the Constitution - to raise revenue required for various development plans, he said. The Rajasthan CM said more than 22% of the total revenue of his state comes from VAT on petrol and diesel. The Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) continues to corner the Gehlot government, demanding a cut in VAT on petrol and diesel. Deputy leader of the Opposition Rajendra Rathore tweeted, “In the name of VAT, the state government is putting extra burden on the public. Neighbouring states has given relief to the common people from the rising prices of petrol and diesel by reducing VAT.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/need-further-cut-in-petrol-diesel-excise-duty-rajasthan-cm-gehlot-to-pm-modi-101636449246085.html

09-11-2021||Lucknow||'Last nail in the coffin for Centre': Rakesh Tikait on Kisan Mahapanchayat||Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) spokesperson Rakesh Tikait said on Tuesday that the Kisan Mahapanchayat in Lucknow on November 22 will prove to be the last nail in the coffin for the Centre and the ongoing farmers' agitation against the three new farm laws will intensify in Purvanchal.The mahapanchayat in Lucknow is being organised by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of around 40 farmer unions. The mahapanchayat was supposed to be held on October 26 but got postponed to November 22 due to adverse weather conditions and the ongoing harvest season.“The Kisan Mahapanchayat on November 22 will be historic. It will prove to be the last nail in the coffin for the anti-farmer government and the three black laws. Now, the farmers' movement will also intensify in Purvanchal,” Tikait said in a Koo post on Tuesday.Since November last year, Rakesh Tikait has been spearheading the protest against the three farm laws in Delhi. In a fresh attack, the BKU spokesperson accused the Centre for not condoling the protesting farmers who died during the ongoing movement."About 750 farmers died in the farm movement...There was no condolence from GoI. Country's farmers feel that perhaps PM Modi is not 'farmers' PM'... and consider them (farmers) as separate from the country," Tikait told news agency ANI on Sunday.And last week, he said that farmers across India will not leave and go anywhere. "If a government can run for five years, then this protest which has the endorsement of the people will continue till the Indian government doesn't pass a law ensuring MSP and repeal three farm laws," Tikait told the news agency.So far, 11 rounds of talks have been held between the farmer unions and the Centre to arrive at a consensus on the three new farm laws. But the discussions have remained inconclusive.In September, farmer unions called for a Bharat Bandh to mark one year of the enactment of these laws by the Union government.Meanwhile, the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Haryana) said on Monday that it will march towards Parliament on November 26 if the SKM gives permission. Gurnam Singh Chaduni, president of BKU (Haryana) said that the group has already passed a resolution for the march, adding, the final decision will be taken by the SKM.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/last-nail-in-the-coffin-for-centre-tikait-on-kisan-mahapanchayat-101636439709232.html

Also read: Kartarpur corridor’s second anniversary today, travel remains suspendedGurdwara Darbar Sahib at Kartarpur in Pakistan is just 4km from zero line on the Indo-Pak border and is the last resting place of Sikhism founder Guru Nanak. To provide Indian pilgrims visa-free access to the gurdwara, the corridor was opened on the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak two years ago. However, it was closed when the Covid-19 pandemic surfaced early last year. Though Pakistan has reopened the corridor after the situation eased, the suspension from the Indian side persists. Seeks ‘khule darshan didar’ for ‘sangat’ After looking at the historic gurdwara through binoculars, Sidhu offered ardas (prayer) and said, “I prayed to Baba Nanak to reopen the corridor. I seek his blessings again, because due to his power, the corridor was opened.”He said 75% of people coming to Darshan Asthan don’t have passports. “Every day, about 5,000 followers pay obeisance here. A year and a half ago, Land Port Authority of India had promised to build a raised platform, Darshan Asthan, (100m wide and 60m high) to facilitate the sangat (community) to have darshan of Kartarpur Sahib gurdwara. It is my request to the home minister of India to give the platform to the sangat.” “I’ll write to the Centre and if there is any problem, they can tell the state government. I guarantee you that Punjab government will work towards this on priority. There should be four to five binoculars. We want that the corridor to stay open. If in case, it has to remain closed for any reason, the Darshan Asthan should be available for everyone for having ‘khule darshan didar’ of the Kartarpur Sahib Gurdwara,” he said. Close ties with Pakistani establishment The cricketer-turned-politician stirred a row by hugging Pakistan army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa, during the oath-taking ceremony of the neighbouring country’s Prime Minister, Imran Khan, in 2018. He made headlines by disclosing that Bajwa had assured him that the Pakistan government is planning to open the corridor, a long-pending demand of Sikhs in India.

The civic body also announced that those who aren’t fully vaccinated against Covid-19 will no longer be allowed to accompany or admit patients at Chatrapati Shivaji Hospital in Thane’s Kalwa. The municipal corporation has given a week’s time to the unvaccinated to get jabbed against the coronavirus disease before the directives are imposed. Also Read: India logs 10,126 fresh Covid-19 infections, lowest in nearly 9 monthsThe orders were issued at a press conference held by Thane’s mayor Naresh Mhaske and civic commissioner Vipin Sharma. The civic body argued that its aim is to urgently get its staff vaccinated because they directly deal with the public. Mhaske said, “The salaries of the employees who have not taken a single dose of the Covid-19 vaccine or have not taken the second dose or are way past the deadline [for a second dose] will be put on hold. Civic officials and employees will have to submit their vaccination certificates to disclose the status of vaccination. Apart from this, relatives or friends who accompany patients to Kalwa hospital also have to be fully vaccinated. Those who will not be vaccinated will immediately have to get vaccinated and [only] then can they accompany patients.” The hospital sees hundreds of patients visiting or being admitted every day from various cities of Maharashtra, especially from rural parts of Thane district, making it a challenging task for the authorities to impose the new directives. Civic officials said private doctors, too, have being asked to get fully vaccinated against Covid-19 and ensure that their employees were also fully jabbed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-anti-covid-jab-no-salaries-declares-thane-municipal-corporation-101636436105277.html

The decision was taken on Monday during a meeting of senior TMC officials, including civic commissioner Dr Vipin Sharma and Thane Mayor Naresh Mhaske.According to an official release issued late Monday night, the civic employees who have not taken the first dose, will not be paid salaries.The civic employees who have not taken their second vaccine dose within the stipulated period will also not get their salaries, the release said. The TMC has made it compulsory for all civic employees to submit their vaccination certificates at their respective offices. These measures are part of an effort to achieve the target of cent per cent vaccination in the city by this month-end, Mhaske told reporters after the meeting. A massive vaccination drive has been initiated in the city, located adjoining Mumbai, from Tuesday to achieve the target of cent per cent vaccination, he said. The mayor sought cooperation of the citizens in achieving the target and appealed to them to take the vaccine shots, and those who have taken one jab to take their second dose as well. The TMC has made available different vaccination centres, including 'on-wheels' inoculation facilities and jumbo vaccination centres. Regular outreach camps are also being held in the city, he said. In addition to this, under the 'Har Ghar Dastak' programme, health employees, ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activist) workers and nurses will go door-to-door and collect details of those who have not taken the vaccine. Such people will be given the jabs, the official said. A total of 167 teams have been formed for the purpose, he added. Those who accompany patients to the civic-run Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj General Hospital at Kalwa here are required to produce their certificates establishing that they are fully vaccinated. Those who have not been inoculated so far will be given the jabs, the release said. Besides, teachers of various schools and colleges have also been roped-in into to create awareness about the vaccination drive among students. The students will in-turn pass on the message about the importance of vaccination to their parents, the release said. The garbage collection vehicles moving in the city will also spread the message about the importance of vaccination, it said. The mayor said it was a good sign that Covid-19 cases in the city were coming down, but every care should be taken that the infection does not rise, and the mega vaccination drive is the only solution for it.On Sunday, Thane district reported 118 new cases of coronavirus, taking the infection count to 5,66,749, while one death raised the toll to 11,543, as per official data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-covid-19-vaccine-jab-no-salary-thane-civic-body-tells-its-employees-101636431232008.html
09-11-2021||Delhi||Froth in Yamuna: What causes it and why it is dangerous?||The visuals of devotees taking a dip in the froth-filled waters of the Yamuna river sent chills down the spine of the residents of Delhi and worried environmentalists. The frothing also led to political war of works between the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Delhi and nearby states.While the BJP leaders alleged that the AAP government did not allow Chhath celebrations on the Yamuna banks to hide the "pathetic" state of the river, the AAP's Gopal Rai and Raghav Chadha blamed the governments in Uttar Pradesh and Haryana for the frothing in the river.The 22-kilometre stretch of the Yamuna between Wazirabad and Okhla, which is less than 2 per cent of its length of 1,370 kilometres from Yamunotri to Allahabad, accounts for around 80 per cent of the pollution load in the river.What is froth formation?This is a phenomenon that takes place on many lakes and streams. Foam bubbles are produced when organic matter decomposes. These foam-producing molecules have one end that repels water and another that attract water and they work to reduce the surface tension on the surface of the water. These foam bubbles are lighter than water, so they float on the surface as a thin film that gradually accumulates.What causes the froth?The presence of phosphates and surfactants in untreated sewage from Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh is a major reason behind frothing in the river, according to experts. While these two components comprise of 1 per cent, the remaining 99 per cent is air and water.AAP leader and Delhi Jal Board Vice Chairman Raghav Chadha said that the waste material falls from a height at the Okhla barrage which leads to the formation of foam.What are the sources of pollution that cause foam formation?Untreated sewage may contain soap-detergent particles. The other sources are industrial effluents, organic matter from decomposing vegetation and presence of filamentous bacteria.The pollution from sugar and paper industries in Uttar Pradesh that travel through the Hindon canal also causes pollution in the Yamuna.What are the health hazards?Short-term exposure can lead to skin irritation and allergies. If ingested, these chemicals may cause gastrointestinal problems and diseases like typhoid. Long term exposure to heavy metals in industrial pollutants can cause neurological issues and hormonal imbalances.The war of wordsRaghav Chadha claimed that Haryana and Uttar Pradesh have been releasing around 155 million gallons of untreated waste water. While the Delhi government has been working to upgrade its sewage treatment plants to meet the revised standards of the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), Uttar Pradesh and Haryana should do their bit in keeping the river clean, he said.BJP MP Manoj Tiwari, who rode a boat in the foam-covered Yamuna, alleged that the AAP government did not allow Chhath Puja on its banks because it wanted to cover up the frothing in the river caused by high pollution load.Reacting to it, Environment Minister Gopal Rai blamed the BJP-led Haryana government for the toxic foam in the river and said leaders of the saffron party here should seek answers from the neighbouring state.On an average, 24 out of the 35 sewage treatment plants (STPs) in the national capital did not meet the prescribed standards for wastewater over the last one year, according to government data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/froth-in-yamuna-what-causes-it-and-why-it-is-dangerous-101636431084672.html
09-11-2021||Mumbai||Majority of Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra reported in urban areas||Largely urban areas in Maharashtra governed by municipal corporations accounted for 68% of new Covid-19 cases that were reported on Monday. The state reported a total of 751 new infections of which 511 were from 27 municipal corporations. Thirteen districts and eight municipal corporations, including Malegaon, Nandurbar, Hingoli, Parbhani, Nanded, Yavatmal, Buldhana and Washim didn’t report a single Covid-19 death on Monday. Most of Maharashtra’s latest cases were reported from Mumbai, Pune, Thane, Kalyan-Dombivli and the Pune Chinchwad municipal corporations. During the peak of the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic on April 18, when the daily cases totalled 68,631, the 27 municipal corporations accounted for 52.47 % of the total number of infections in the state, at 36,017. State surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate said the bulk of the Covid-19 cases were being reported in places where the density of population was high. Also Read: Karnataka issues Covid-19 guidelines for short term travellers from Maharashtra“Urban areas are highly populated and show a high density of population, owing to which they are reporting the majority of the cases. However, if we look at the overall picture, we have been able to control the Covid-19 infection rate effectively,” said Dr Awate. Dr Wiqar Shaikh, professor of medicine at Grant Medical College and Sir JJ Hospital, blamed space constraints for the high caseload, among other reasons. “It is almost impossible to maintain social distancing in cities. In addition, we are seeing that people are not adhering to Covid-19 guidelines as many are not wearing masks and are crowding the markets. Even mass gatherings have started,” said Dr Shaikh. The total case tally for the state was 6,618,347 as of Monday, while the death toll was 140,403. On Monday, 1,555 patients recovered from the infection and the test positivity rate was reported at 1.22%, with 751 positive cases recorded after 61,720 fresh tests. The state has 13,649 active cases, of which Mumbai has 3,599, followed by Pune (2,985) and Ahmednagar (2,225). Mumbai recorded 206 new cases and five deaths on Monday, taking its Covid-19 fatalities to 16,281.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pandemic-majority-of-covid-19-cases-in-maharashtra-reported-in-urban-areas-101636430584710.html

09-11-2021||Delhi||Crop burning, Diwali: Why air quality deteriorated sharply in Delhi||Pollution has been hitting dangerous levels across New Delhi and other parts of northern India this month, in a sharp deterioration from October when people breathed the cleanest air in four years.Here are some of the factors that are driving the abrupt changes in air quality and compounding the problems regularly caused by crop burning and Diwali festival firecrackers.WHY THE RELATIVE RESPITE IN OCTOBER?In past years, air quality has generally started to decline steadily in the region around October after farmers finish harvesting their rice crops.Typically, the growers from the states of Punjab and Haryana near New Delhi then start clearing space for wheat by torching rice paddy stubble left behind by mechanised harvesters.This year, however, regular rains made it difficult for farmers to set fire to the rice paddy stubble and start re-planting.As a result, the Air Quality Index - which measures the concentration of poisonous particulate matter PM2.5 in a cubic metre of air - came in at an average 72 across the region in October, sharply down from 126 the same month last year.That is still above what the government says is a "safe" limit of 50.WHY THE SURGE IN NOVEMBER?Grain growers have had to move quickly to make up for the time they lost in October.In an average year, they would have had 20-25 days to harvest the rice crop and plant wheat. Speed is everything as late planting can result in lower crop yields and substantial losses.This year, many have said they will focus on the first two weeks in November and burn whole areas at once, rather than staggering fields.The pollution from crop burning is due to peak at a time when temperatures drop further and pollutants get trapped in the air in thick winter fogs and smogs.It has also coincided with Diwali, when Indians set off firecrackers as part of an ancient Hindu tradition.On Friday, the day after the festival, the Air Quality Index in New Delhi and other cities surged to 451 on a scale of 500, indicating "severe" conditions.WHY IS DELHI VULNERABLE TO POLLUTION?India's vast northern plains are drier and dustier than other parts of the country. New Delhi, despite being one of the greenest cities in India, is also exposed to pollutants coming from Afghanistan and Pakistan, experts say.Dust from the Thar Desert, or the Great Indian Desert, in the northwestern part of the subcontinent, adds to Delhi's pollution.Outside the city, experts say farmers have also been slow to adopt technologies and techniques that could cut down on the pollution coming from crop burning.Since 2018, India has given up to an 80% subsidy to farmers to buy machines that dispose of rice stubble left out in the field by mechanised harvesters without burning.But poor implementation of the plan means that a large number of farmers still prefer to burn crop waste.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/crop-burning-diwali-why-air-quality-deteriorated-sharply-in-delhi-101636428407906.html

09-11-2021||Chandigarh||Possibility of 3rd Covid wave low in Haryana, next 4 weeks crucial: Experts||With Haryana experiencing a low coronavirus infection count during the festival season, the health authorities are increasingly becoming confident about staving off the third wave. For nine weeks in a row, the number of weekly active cases have remained in double digits. Since Dussehra in mid-October, the past four weeks have seen 83, 81, 95 and 74 infections, as per the health department data. Additional chief secretary, health, Rajeev Arora, said despite the low levels of viral infection in the state, there is a need to be watchful for a month. “We will lay emphasis on enhanced testing and increase the pace of vaccination to consolidate the gains of the past few months to keep the Covid spread at very low levels,” he added. State nodal officer for Covid, Dr Dhruva Chaudhary said that molecular surveillance of Covid cases needs to be done for the emergence of new variants. Dr Chaudhary said though he does not see a third wave of infection coming yet, the health authorities are keeping their fingers crossed. “I will get concerned only if there are breakthrough infections and hospital admissions. As of now, the delta variant is not a cause of concern,” he added. The nodal officer said the reason for a minimal infection count is that a majority people now have antibodies to fight the virus. “The third round of serological survey showed that about 76% of our population has antibodies either due to infection or vaccination. Past infection and aggressive vaccination are responsible for the decline in cases. However, next two weeks will be very crucial. We need to be vigilant and see whether there is any increase in the infection rate,” Dr Chaudhary added. After going through the roof with over a lakh infections in the first week of May, the virus load in the state has been on a constant decline for 26 consecutive weeks. Health department statistics showed that 74 fresh infections were reported last week (November 1-7) as compared to 95 the week before (October 25-31). There are 13 districts, which do not have even a single active case. The data also showed that 1.04 lakh persons were tested last week, a per day average of about 14,995 samples. The second wave of virus during the devastating six-week period in April and May had thrown more than 4.21 lakh infections and over 4,200 fatalities in the state. While the virus, as per the data, took 249 days to hit peak in November 2020 during the first wave, it took just 93 days to peak during the second wave this May, primarily due to the virulence of the highly contagious delta variant. The state has so far inoculated about 2.61 crore people, 87% of whom have got the first jab and about 40% have been administered both the doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/possibility-of-3rd-covid-wave-low-in-haryana-next-4-weeks-crucial-experts-101636415343020.html

The law will be applicable for 10 years and jobs for the unskilled, semi-skilled and skilled labour having gross monthly salary not more than ₹30,000 will come under its ambit. “A person living in Haryana for the past five years will get the domicile certificate. We are committed to providing employment to the youth under this law, while new startups and IT units have been given exemption of two years from coming under its ambit,” said the deputy CM, who also holds the portfolio of department of industries and commerce, labour and employment, in a news conference. Dushyant said internal hiring will also be exempted from this law and the gross monthly salary for hiring has been reduced from previous ₹50,000 to ₹30,000. He said talks were held at state and national levels with all stakeholders before giving final shape to the law. Allaying doubts revolving around this quota, Dushyant said among the relaxations given includes two years’ exemption to the startups and new IT companies. Also, it will not be mandatory for the employer to hire eligible local youth from one district only, he added. Stating that Haryana has opened new doors of employment for the local youth by implementing this law, he said the private companies, trusts, and societies have been directed to fill the details of their employees by registering on the ‘Haryana Udyam Memorandum’ portal by January 15, 2022. At least 16,000 companies have registered themselves so far, he added. The deputy CM said the Haryana government will formulate a special scheme for MSMEs under which small ‘MSME industrial parks’ will be set up in each block to create employment opportunities for the locals and encourage export of local products. Indirectly referring to the current farmers’ agitation, Dushyant urged the youth to analyse how this agitation has affected development of the state. ‘51 lakh MT paddy procured till November 2’Dushyant said that Haryana had procured 51 lakh MT paddy till November 2 and ₹8,900 crore as MSP had been transferred to the bank accounts of farmers. He said the procurement will continue till November 15. He said ₹394 crore has been directly transferred to the accounts of bajra growers as price difference ( ₹600 per quintal) under the Bhavantar Bharpayee Yojana. He said it was for the first time that if a farmer got the I-form before 3pm, the payment of the crop was also made by 5pm on the same day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/upcoming-it-units-startups-exempted-from-hiring-locals-for-2-years-haryana-deputy-cm-101636414863066.html
09-11-2021||Chandigarh||Khattar inaugurates new cooperative sugar mill in Karnal||Crushing operations at the government-operated sugar mills began on Monday with Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar inaugurating the newly set up cooperative mill in Karnal. The chief minister said the sugar mill will not only crush 3,500 tonnes of cane daily, but also generate 18 MW power. He said this was a long-pending demand of the people as the existing mill was around 44 years old and unable to crush the entire produce of the farmers. Khattar said ₹263 crore has been spent on setting up of new sugar mill. He also assured that the pending payments of farmers will be cleared soon, directions regarding which have been issued to the Karnal deputy commissioner. The chief minister also inaugurated a 60 KL per day ethanol plant at the Shahbad cooperative sugar mill virtually. “This plant will also help in meeting the growing demand of the green fuel,” he added. To produce sulphur free refined sugarThe Karnal mill will be the first in the state to produce sulphur-free refined sugar, said Aditi, managing director of the mill. As per technical experts, sulphur is an additive used by manufacturers for purifying sugar. This year, the mill has set a target to crush 55 lakh quintals of sugarcane and the MD said they had done the bonding with the farmers to supply around 60 lakh quintals sugarcane. Officials said to meet the crushing capacity of the new mill, around 10 lakh tonnes of sugarcane from the nearby mills has been allocated to the Karnal facility. Farm agitation limited to some stubborn people: CMReacting over farmers’ agitation, Khattar said this protest was now limited to some stubborn people. “The issue will be resolved if these people shun stubbornness and come for talks with the government or let the agitation continue even for years,” he said when asked about the farm leaders’ warning to intensify the stir. “But they will not be given a free hand to disturb the law and order and action will be taken against those involved in any violence. FIR has already been registered against the people involved in Hisar’s Narnaund incident,” he added. However, the chief minister skipped a question over BJP’s Rohtak MP Arvind Sharma’s controversial statement. Without naming anybody, he said, “There is a need to speak about the people who had chopped off hands and legs instead of reacting over the statements.”The chief minister, meanwhile, also announced a 25% increase in the compensation given to the farmers for their damaged crops. He said the farmers will be given a compensation of ₹15,000 per acre for 100% damage instead of ₹12,000. Khattar also announced that the farmers having up to two acres of agriculture land need not to pay premium for the PM’s crop insurance scheme. He said the government will also bear 50% of the premium for the farmers having two to five acres of agricultural land. Night food court comes up in cityKhattar also inaugurated a night food market at Sector 12 of Karnal. The chief minister said residents will get all kinds of fast food at one market, which has around 40 stalls. The night food court will remain open from 6pm to 12am and offer a variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian food items. A part of the smart city project, it will have seating arrangement for around 1,000 people. Khattar also announced to open such food courts at four more locations. ‘Antyodaya Gramodaya Mela’ to be held across Haryana: CMHaryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar said on Monday that ‘Antyodaya Gramodaya Mela’ would be organised across the state in order to increase the income of poor families and financially empower them. Presiding over the state working committee meeting of BJP’s OBC Morcha in Panchkula, he said the work of income verification is being done by collecting data through Parivar Pehchan Patra Yojana. The work of setting up self-employment through 40 schemes of six departments is at the final stage, he added. To increase the income of poor families, financial assistance will be provided from the banks through the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana. Khattar said the officers of the OBC Morcha should prepare a list of 10 such families in their surrounding areas and send it to the government.(With inputs from HTC Chandigarh)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/khattar-inaugurates-new-cooperative-sugar-mill-in-karnal-101636414323195.html
09-11-2021||Jaipur||70 demoiselle cranes found dead, Newcastle disease suspected||Around 70 demoiselle cranes, popularly known as Kurjan in western Rajasthan, have been found dead in Kaparda village near Jodhpur over the last three days, with forest department officials blaming the highly contagious Newcastle disease which affects the respiratory tracks of the birds. However, tests on viscera samples that can establish this are awaited, and at least one expert believes the deaths are actually the result of pesticide poisoning.The officials said another 150 birds are stranded because they cannot fly due to the disease.The Newcastle disease is caused by a virus belonging to the paramyxovirus family. The forest department has sent the viscera samples of the birds to IVRI Bhopal for further investigation. DN Pandey, the head of the forest department, said only the report will provide a clear picture.The migratory cranes fly thousands of kilometers to various parts of Rajasthan’s Marwar and Phalodi regions from the wetlands of Mongolia and Caucasus in October. They stay there for about five months before returning to their homes.The birds also make Kaparda, which is about 200km from Keechan, their home during the winter months. Forest department extimates that there are about 300 migratory cranes in Kaparda.Dr Shravan Singh Rathore, who is treating the birds in Jodhpur, said at least 70 cranes have died and around 150 are sick and not moving even in water, meaning that they can be paralysed.“Prima facie it looks like a case of Ranikhet aka Newcastle disease. However, the exact reason would be known after the lab reports of the viscera are received,” he said. The post mortem examination of the birds suggests the virus is behind it, with the lungs and intestines being infected, and the oxygen supply, curtailed, he added. “The viscera samples have been sent to Bhopal. The report is expected in a day or two...”In 2016, 35 birds in Rajasthan died because of the same disease, he added.Microbiologist Dr AK Kataria ruled out Newcastle disease and claimed the birds died due to organophosphorus toxicity, an annual phenomenon in this migratory season. “The deaths of cranes are due to organophosphorus toxicity. This toxicity develops when the farmers spray medicine on crops to kill insects, which are eaten by birds leading to death,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/70-demoiselle-cranes-found-dead-newcastle-disease-suspected-101636412169119.html
09-11-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: His relationship with cash||Late night. The vegetable vendors are gone. The Mother Dairy booth has downed its shutters. The homeless brown dog is sleeping. The cold smoggy air is making the glow from street lamps look vapoury. The lane is empty, except for a rickshaw parked under a tree. Rickshaw puller Raibul Nadaf is sitting on a nearby bench. His hands are full of ₹20, ₹50 and ₹100 notes. “I’m counting how much I earned today,” he says distractedly, faintly smiling.This is Mr Nadaf’s daily ritual before he returns to his room in Sarai Kale Khan, nearby. His relationship with money is very elemental. It is untouched by an ATM card or a cheque book. In his 50s, the Bihar native has been in Delhi for 30 years, and has survived so far without a bank account. He doesn’t even have a wallet; he uses a small plastic pouch instead.Once back in the room, Mr Nadaf keeps his money inside a cloth bag. He has no closet, or even a suitcase. “But my money is always safe in the room… the other rickshaw pullers who live with me also store their money the same way.”A large part of Mr Nadaf’s earnings are exhausted in everyday expenses. He nevertheless manages to save a modest amount every month. It is always a challenge to send the savings to his wife in Saharsa (by now, his four children are settled into their respective households). He is consequently obliged to seek the help of acquaintances, who hold bank accounts, to transfer the money from Delhi to the village.Only recently did he start toying with the idea of having a bank account. “I’m growing old… kya maloom (who can tell) how long will my ageing body be able to handle the rickshaw…” Consequently, Mr Nadaf feels the need to regularly deposit some part of the cash he earns everyday in a bank, and maintain a pool of money that can be used in a health-related emergency. Some days back, a friendly tailor in Sarai Kale Khan gifted him ₹500, the minimum amount required to create a bank account, the tailor told him. Mr Nadaf realises that having such an account will also enable him to acquire an ATM card. “I see people getting rupees from the machine. I’ll then have to no longer keep my money in the room.”Mr Nadaf now gets up to leave. “Today I earned ₹300,” he says, carefully sliding the money pouch into his shirt pocket.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-his-relationship-with-cash-101636408368335.html

09-11-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: No general coaches for long-route trains, migrants travel sans tickets for Chhath||In the absence of general coaches in long-route trains, the Northern Railways is struggling to accommodate the heavy rush of migrants heading home for Chhath Puja on November 10, with most of them travelling without tickets in reserved compartments as they failed to book in advance. General coaches were excluded in long-route trains this year, due to fear of Covid spread.Meanwhile, the railways has intensified ticket checking in view of the festive rush. Railway authorities in Ludhiana claimed to have collected ₹12 lakh during checking over the last two days. According to officials, ₹4 lakh was recovered from ticket violators on Saturday while ₹8 lakh was recovered on Sunday.The drive continued on Monday as the Ludhiana railway station was flooded with passengers, struggling to board the trains with heavy luggage in tow. “Only trains running from Ludhiana to Ferozepur, Ludhiana to Hisar and Ludhiana to Lohian Khas, Jalandhar have general coaches. Despite starting special festival trains for migrants, many of them couldn’t be accommodated as only those with the prior reservations could travel,” said a railway official.The official added that in the absence of general coaches, passengers tend to travel without tickets in reserved coaches as many of them are not able to book in advance. Jagatpal, a passenger on Amritsar-Katihar Express who was fined, said he couldn’t reserve a seat in advance as his contractor sanctioned his leave at the last moment. “There were no seats left in the train but since I had to reach my hometown for Chhath, I boarded the train without a ticket. Railways should have arranged more seats for us or at least allowed general coaches during festivals,” he said. When asked, a senior official said that such decisions are taken by the central ministry. “Since everything is back on track, general coaches should also have been allowed to ply, he said.New record in ticket violation fineContinuing its special checking drive on Sunday, Firozpur division of Northern Railways recovered ₹20.93 lakh fine from ticket violators in a day, surpassing its previous day’s record of ₹16.43 lakh.A team of 35 ticket checkers conducted the special checking in trains running from or through Amritsar-Jalandhar railway section and Jalandhar-Ludhiana railway section on Saturday. They caught 2, 831 persons for the violation on Sunday. The offenders on Sunday were caught travelling in Paschim Express, Katihar express, Begumpura and Malwa Express. The team recovered the fare as well as penalty amount from the violators on the spot. Senior divisional commercial manager Chetan Taneja warned people against resorting to such unlawful means of travelling.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-no-general-coaches-for-long-route-trains-migrants-travel-sans-tickets-for-chhath-101636406222196.html
09-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi high court outlines steps to upgrade safety in district courts||Proposing a slew of measures for enhancing security in the district courts of the national capital, the Delhi high court on Monday said special courtrooms may be created within jails to hold hearings related to high-risk prisoners, so that their physical appearance before the courts is reduced.While hearing a suo motu petition, taken up after jailed gangster Jitendra Maan Gogi was shot dead inside the Rohini courts in September, a bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh said the appearance of high-risk prisoners before the courts should be ensured, as far as possible, only through the virtual mode.When and if they are required to be physically present, the court suggested that proceedings be conducted inside vulnerable witness deposition courtrooms or inside jails. To facilitate such hearings, prison authorities will have to create a well-equipped courtroom in each jail complex, the bench said. It, however, clarified that these were “suggestions and not directions”.It proposed the state government be accountable for allocation of budget for the purchase of security devices and as the police have the expertise, they should purchase them under intimation to the government and the court.The bench clarified that it will issue appropriate “directions” to the authorities after all stakeholders have first perused the suggestions “summarised” by it.The police commissioner will put together a team of experts for a security audit of courts and deploy an appropriate number of personnel accordingly, the court said.It suggested that everyone, including advocates, be subjected to frisking, which is “quick and efficient”, and all are made to pass through metal detectors. No baggage may be allowed inside courts without being scanned.The court also suggested placing all court complexes under round-the-clock CCTV monitoring, issuing “stickers” to vehicles that may be permitted entry inside a court complex and installing under vehicle scanning systems as well as automated gates to tackle crowds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-high-court-outlines-steps-to-upgrade-safety-in-district-courts-101636405595610.html

A 24-hour complete corona curfew with no movement of people, except for permissible activities, will be imposed at Lal Bazar, Hyderpora, Chanapora and two different pockets of Bemina from midnight Tuesday, Srinagar deputy commissioner Mohammad Aijaz Asad said. “All shopping complexes, bazaars, saloons, barber shops, and restaurants will remain closed as will all educational institutions ,” he said, adding that no gathering has been allowed except marriages with a ceiling of 20 people and funerals with 10 persons.Of the 1,165 active coronavirus cases in Jammu and Kashmir till November 8, almost half or 587 are in Srinagar. This is the only district with which is reporting around 40-60 cases daily, around half of the daily cases in the whole union territory. On Sunday the district had reported 87 cases.Asad said that there has been a steep rise in Covid positive cases in the district in the past 17 days and 63% of the daily cases have been detected from a few particular areas. “Strict containment measures are also required in order to ensure safety of the public,” the order said. However ‘essential services’ have been allowed to continue both in the public and private sector.“Standalone grocery, vegetable, milk and meat shops may remain open from 7 am to 11 am only,” it said.On Saturday Asad had warned of the return of stringent restrictions to parts of Srinagar if the spurt in Covid cases in some pockets of the city was not contained. There are 82 containment zones in Srinagar, eight of which were added on Friday.Although Jammu and Kashmir recorded its lowest Covid-19 count in eight months in October, the union territory has been witnessing a slow and consistent rise in active cases over the past two weeks- majority of which is contributed by Srinagar.The active cases in J&K had been on the decline, reaching its lowest ebb on October 20 with 800 cases. However after October 20, the active cases slowly went up and reached 1,165 on November 08, an increase of 45% in 19 days.J&K sees three deaths, 111 Covid cases Jammu and Kashmir reported 111 Covid cases and three deaths on Monday, officials said. Of the total cases, 92 cases were reported in Kashmir valley with its capital Srinagar, which is witnessing a spurt in cases, responsible for 44 infections. The three deaths were also witnessed in the Kashmir valley, one each in Srinagar, Budgam and Bandipora districts. The Jammu division saw 19 infections. The number of patients who were cured in the UT was 96 with active positive cases reaching 1,165.Officials said with 44 cases, Srinagar had the highest number of new infections followed by 15 cases in Budgam, 11 cases in Ganderbal and 10 in Baramulla with no or single-digit cases in the other 16 districts.Srinagar district has the highest number of active cases at 587 followed by Baramulla and Budgam districts with 166 and 87 active cases respectively.The government’s daily health bulletin also said that 83,836 vaccine doses were administered taking overall doses administered in the UT to 1.525 crores.The overall number of people who have recovered reached 3,27,579 prompting the recovery rate to reach 98.31%.

Jammu district has the highest number of 1,146 fatalities followed by Srinagar with 852 deaths.Winter could bring rise in Covid cases: DAKWith a sudden surge in the number of Covid cases in Kashmir valley in the last few days, Doctors Association Kashmir (DAK) on Monday said winter months could bring rise in the number of coronavirus cases.“We could see a further spike in cases,” said DAK President and influenza expert Dr Nisar ul Hassan in a statement. “However, the number of severe cases and hospitalisations will be considerably lower than that of last winter,” he said, adding that cold and drier conditions are favourable to the viral stability. “Covid-19 tends to thrive in cooler conditions and survives outside better when it is cold,” he said.Dr Hassan said low humidity during winter is the main driver of virus transmission. In environments with low humidity, the virus stays suspended for much longer in the air which increases the risk of transmission.General Secretary DAK Dr Arshad Ali said Jammu and Kashmir had a large unvaccinated population. As of November 8, 2021, 45% of the population in J&K has been fully vaccinated. “This means around 55% of the population is susceptible, which is enough to sustain the virus,” he said. “In order to prevent the revival of Covid-19, we need to vaccinate 80-90% of the population,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/10day-corona-curfew-in-5-areas-of-srinagar-after-cases-surge-101636405444150.html

09-11-2021||Dehradun||In Cong vs BJP in Uttarakhand, a new row over wearing shoes in Kedarnath shrine||DEHRADUN: The ruling BJP and opposition Congress accused each other of “breaching the sanctity” of the Kedarnath shrine in the Rudraprayag district after the Congress insisted that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other BJP leaders including chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami wore shoes in the shrine and sat in front of it by showing their back.The context for the allegations first levelled by the Congress was the November 5 Kedarnath visit of Modi during which he performed a special puja at the shrine and then addressed a gathering in front of it from a makeshift stage. The Congress, which has lately stepped up attacks on the BJP government ahead of assembly elections early next year, said it was unpardonable.“What Modi and the other BJP leaders did on that day, is unpardonable. They not just wore shoes in the temple but showed their backs towards Lord Kedarnath which was totally against the sanctity and faith,” said Harish Rawat, the former Uttarakhand chief minister and Congress national general secretary.“The PM’s act of wearing shoes in the sacred place of Kedarnath temple has opened a Pandora’s box. Now, all the other BJP leaders will do the same by taking advantage of his act which has hurt the sentiments of devotees,” he said.Launching its counterattack, the BJP cited the visit of present Congress state president Ganesh Godiyal and former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamalnath in Kedarnath shrine while wearing shoes in 2013. “The Congress is accusing our leaders of breaching the sanctity of Kedarnath but they should not forget the acts of their own leaders. In 2013, Godiyal and Kamalnath had gone inside the temple wearing shoes that grossly breached the sanctity of the temple. The Congress should first look at its own acts than accusing us,” said BJP state vice president Devendra Bhasin.Godiyal, however, refuted the allegations saying, “Kamalnath and I had visited the temple at the time of the 2013 tragedy during which bodies were lying in the temple premises. That time, our biggest duty was to rescue people and provide them with immediate help which we did.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/in-cong-vs-bjp-in-uttarakhand-a-new-row-over-wearing-shoes-in-kedarnath-shrine-101636404482023.html

Seeking intervention of the chief justice of the Jammu and Kashmir high court, Singh said, “While officials of the health department from Jammu division did not give the exact details in their RTI query, Government Medical College Srinagar, especially the head of anaesthesiology and critical care furnished clear information with regard to the defective ventilators of the three different brands supplied to them under PM CARES.” “HOD anaesthesiology said in his reply that the department received Bharat ventilators that were put to a trial run. However, all these ventilators were returned to the medical superintendent due to varied malfunctions in compressors and other flaws”, he said. “Similarly, three Agva ventilators also had some problems such as the display not working, trouble generating tidal volume etc,” said Singh. “As far as the ventilators of DHAMAN-III were concerned, the HOD stated in the reply that 125 ventilators of this make have been kept at DRDO Hospital, Srinagar. Out of 125 ventilators, two were kept at SMHS Hospital for trial run in order to ascertain their efficacy. They were also found defective and thus were not feasible for patient care,” said the RTI activist. “Beside 22 Agva ventilators have been kept at DRDO Hospital in Srinagar for trial,” he added. Singh suspected that the installation of defective ventilators in health institutions of Jammu division could be one of the major reasons for high Covid mortality rate. “Keeping in view the seriousness of the issue and to save precious lives of the inhabitants of the UT, as there is every apprehension of the third Covid-19 wave, we humbly request the chief justice of the J&K High Court to take serious cognisance of the issue and issue directions to the chief secretary to constitute a committee of experts to examine the functioning of all the ventilators,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pm-cares-all-165-ventilators-sent-to-srinagar-govt-hospital-defective-rti-activist-101636404241951.html
09-11-2021||Chandigarh||Navjot Sidhu questions Channi govt’s ‘failure’ to challenge Saini’s blanket bail in Supreme Court||Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu on Monday questioned the state government’s failure to file a special leave petition (SLP) in the Supreme Court challenging the blanket bail granted to former director general of police (DGP) Sumedh Singh Saini by the Punjab and Haryana High Court on September 10. Addressing a press conference in Chandigarh, Sidhu said it had been seven years since but justice was still awaited in the 2015 Behbal Kalan police firing incident in which two Sikh protesters seeking action in the sacrilege episode were killed. Claiming that the sacrilege cases can’t move forward with a blanket bail to Saini, whom he referred to as prime accused in the case, the Congress leader hit out at advocate general APS Deol and DGP Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota for inaction. He also questioned the role of 40 ruling party MLAs who sought Amarinder Singh’s removal from the chief minister’s post over inaction in the drug and sacrilege cases and had “threatened to break into Saini’s house”, but were not speaking up when the Charanjit Singh Channi government was not doing the needful. “I am feeling burdened over the sacrilege issue,” he said, adding that the party has to choose either him or the two officers (DGP and AG) who were hampering justice in the cases. “The high court on April 9 had asked the state government to complete investigation in the Kotkapura firing case in six months. The deadline lapsed but nothing has happened in the case,” the cricketer-turned-politician said after the media briefing following the proceedings of the first day of special Vidhan Sabha session were adjourned. The state Congress chief also asked the government to make public the report on the drug case which was kept in a sealed cover in the high court in the upcoming assembly sitting on November 11. He added, “No one stops the government from disclosing facts of the investigations.” Sidhu raised similar issues on micro-blogging site Twitter on Sunday, a day after APS Deol accused him of obstructing the functioning of the state government and the advocate general’s office. With this, the standoff between Sidhu and CM Charanjit Singh Channi over Deol’s appointment continues. Sidhu is opposed to appointment of Deol, who had represented Saini in the police firing cases, and has been pressing for his removal. He had resigned from his post on September 28. He withdrew his resignation last week but made Deol’s removal a precondition for resuming his duties. Responding to a query, Sidhu said he did not always criticise the government and praised the good work. “I welcome petrol and diesel price cut. But the question here is that for how long it will continue. Can this continue for the next five years?” he asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/navjot-sidhu-questions-channi-govt-s-failure-to-challenge-saini-s-blanket-bail-in-supreme-court-101636403646430.html

09-11-2021||Chandigarh||Biggest scam in PM Cares: Mehbooba||People’s Democratic Party president Mehbooba Mufti on Monday said the Prime Minister refusing to account for the money in the PM-CARES (Prime Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations) fund indicated that it was the biggest scam. Labelling it as a “sophisticated” form of corruption, Mehbooba said, “They used to say that demonetisation will bring back black money, violence will end, and so will corruption. However, the level of corruption prevalent now has never been seen before,” she said.“You do not want to give an account of a fund that has millions and billions. If this is not corruption, then what is it?” she rhetorically asked. On reports pertaining to the ventilators supplied to Kashmiri hospitals under the PM-CARES Fund being defective, she said. “Not only the ventilators sent here are defunct, but even those which reached Gujarat and other places are defunct. The biggest scam is in the PM-CARES fund,” she alleged.She also lent her support to farmers protesting against the three farm laws that were passed by the Parliament last year.“For the past year, farmers have been on the roads and many of them have become martyrs and some have even even died by suicide. However, the union government is not affected. If this is not arrogance, then what is?” “These times will not last. The farmers anger and the results of some states will force the BJP government to take note,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/biggest-scam-in-pm-cares-mehbooba-101636403041876.html
09-11-2021||Chandigarh||CM Channi hobnobbing with liquor, sand mafia: Sukhbir||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Monday accused Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi of hobnobbing with the liquor and sand mafia.At a dharna organised near the Bathinda district administrative complex (DAC) in support of farmers, Badal said the ruling political dispensation is in league with the unscrupulous elements whereas the issues of the farming community are not being addressed. “It is for the first time in the history of Punjab when the key revenue-generating portfolios like excise and mining are attached with the CM office and not given to separate ministers. It was planned to favour the mafia engaged in the sand and liquor trade. Individuals holding top political positions and their families are involved in extracting money from contractors at the fag end of the Congress party’s tenure in Punjab,” alleged the SAD chief.Badal said, ahead of the wheat-sowing period, Punjab farmers are facing a shortage of di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) fertiliser but the state government has failed to make necessary arrangements in advance.“There has been open black marketeering of DAP and farmers are being fleeced. Farmers are being forced to buy other farm chemicals to procure DAP from the outlets. Government has failed to check the ongoing malpractices,” he added.Former deputy CM said cotton growers are left in a financial lurch after their crop was damaged due to pink bollworm attack. “Government’s announcement to grant a maximum ₹12,000 per acre compensation is a cruel joke with the agrarian community. Crop loss assessment process was faulty and open to corruption and favoritism,” said Badal.He also flayed the government’s decision to stop paddy procurement in several districts even as farmers are arriving mandis with their non-basmati produce.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cm-channi-hobnobbing-with-liquor-sand-mafia-sukhbir-101636402981760.html
09-11-2021||Chandigarh||Demonetisation biggest mistake in economic history: Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate||Demonetisation was the biggest mistake made by a government in post-independence India which gained nothing for the country but only caused suffering to the common man, All India Congress Committee (AICC) national spokesperson Supriya Shrinate said on Monday. Shrinate said the economy of India had plunged after the decision was made due to business and job loss. “It is the fifth anniversary of demonetisation and the country has still not recovered. When demonetisation took place, the government said it would help recover the black money. However, nothing that sort of happened, and instead the common man lost their hard-earned money,” she said, adding that even the promise to rein in terrorist activities was not fulfilled.She alleged that it was former CAG Vinod Rai who collaborated with BJP to hatch a conspiracy against the then UPA government in 2014. “The conspiracy now stands exposed. Vinod Rai, in a defamation case filed by Sanjay Nirupam against him, submitted an affidavit in the court saying that he had lied about the scam in the UPA government and has apologized for it,” she said. He said after false CAG reports several leaders including Narendra Modi, Baba Ram Dev, Anna Hazare and Arvind Kejriwal had launched a campaign against the UPA government. Shirnate further said that under the BJP regime autonomous institutions of the country have become very weak. “The biggest example of this is that no question is being raised by any of these institutions about the PM-Cares Fund, she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/demonetisation-biggest-mistake-in-economic-history-congress-spokesperson-supriya-shrinate-101636402561821.html
09-11-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: 3 houses burgled in a locality on same night||A gang of burglars targeted three houses in Dharampura locality on the intervening night of Sunday and Monday, while the families were asleep. The burglars took away nine mobile phones and a pair of earrings from the houses. All three families reported that they woke up with a severe headache, leading to suspicion that the burglars may have sprayed some sedatives. Complainant Gurdeep Singh, a farmer, said he and his two brothers woke up with a headache and blurry vision on Monday morning and found their phones missing. Meanwhile, their tenants who live on the first floor told them that their phones were also missing. Later, it was found that the family living in the adjacent house also lost their phones and a pair of earrings. The victims tried to make calls to their mobile phones, but all phones were switched off. Closed-circuit television cameras installed behind the house captured some suspects roaming on the street around 3.45 am. Gurdeep said it seems the miscreants had entered the house after scaling the compound wall.Assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Gurjit Singh, the investigating officer, said an FIR will be lodged after investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-3-houses-burgled-in-a-locality-on-same-night-101636402502005.html
09-11-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab Congress affairs incharge meets CM Channi, Navjot Sidhu amid standoff over appointments||All India Congress Committee (AICC) secretary in-charge of Punjab affairs Harish Chaudhary on Monday held a meeting with chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi and state party president Navjot Singh Sidhu amid a tense standoff between the two over senior government appointments and action in the sacrilege and drug cases. The meeting was held barely two-and-a-half hours after the Punjab Congress chief, who has been opposed to the appointment of APS Deol and Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota as the state’s advocate general (AG) and director general of police (DGP), targeted his own party’s government and the two officers at a press conference. Sidhu came to the meeting with cabinet minister Pargat Singh. The PPCC chief, who has been adamant on the removal of the AG and the top cop, again took up the issue that has remained unresolved despite the CM’s assurances. Sidhu and Deol are locked in a war of words with both accusing each other of obstructing justice in the sacrilege and drug cases. Deol had tendered his resignation to the CM last week, but it is still to be accepted. The three also discussed the bills and resolutions pertaining to power purchase agreements (PPAs), BSF jurisdiction and the three farm laws to be brought by the government in the state assembly on November 11, a person familiar with the development said. Cabinet minister Raj Kumar Verka said that Chaudhary first met the CM and the state chief separately and then they held a joint meeting wherein all these issues were discussed at length. “The misunderstandings are getting cleared and everything will be sorted out in the next two days. If any officer is a proving an impediment in these cases or needs to be taken off, he will be replaced,” the minister told reporters after the meeting. An aide of PPCC chief said there was a discussion on the organisational set-up of the party. Meanwhile, Congress MP from Anandpur Sahib Manish Tewari also targeted the Punjab government for not challenging the issue of increased BSF jurisdiction in the Supreme Court. “It has been close to a month now Central Govt by notification has extended @BSF_India operational remit in Punjab to 50 Kilometres. Why till now notification has not been challenged by @PunjabGovtIndia under Article 131 in Supreme Court of India Is opposition to it mere tokenism? (sic)” he tweeted. The Channi-led government had recently held an all-party meeting on the issue and is holding a two-day session of the state assembly to oppose the Centre’s notification on the BSF jurisdiction. The matter is scheduled to come up in the assembly on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-congress-affairs-incharge-meets-cm-channi-navjot-sidhu-amid-standoff-over-appointments-101636402386080.html

Leader of opposition Harpal Singh Cheema said the whole thrust of chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi and his cabinet was to cover up the shortcomings of the government’s rule of four-and-a-half-years. “The chief minister and the finance minister should tell who is responsible for this wasteful expenditure?” he asked. The AAP, Cheema said, would seek from the Congress government an account of its performance. “We will ask questions with regard to BSF jurisdiction, agriculture loans, scheduled castes (SCs), traders and the protesting PTI teachers,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/aap-slams-to-move-to-adjourn-assembly-proceedings-101636401841113.html

The SAD leader also condemned the Congress government for making the ‘Ghar Ghar Naukari’ scheme applicable to only sons and relatives of ministers and ruling party MLAs. On Navjot Singh Sidhu, Majithia said the state Congress president did not have faith in his chief minister and has virtually brought a motion of no-confidence against him. “The CM should resign forthwith,” he said.On the occasion, senior Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and councillor Amarjit Bhatia joined the SAD along with his supporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-cm-channi-lying-with-false-adverts-on-fuel-price-cut-akali-dal-101636401783745.html
09-11-2021||Chandigarh||2015 sacrilege cases: Got some crucial info, says SIT after Ram Rahim’s questioning||Punjab Police’s special investigation team (SIT) probing the 2015 sacrilege cases asked over 100 questions from Dera Sacha Sauda head Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh during his grilling for more than seven hours at Sunaria Jail in Rohtak on Monday. The dera head was questioned from 10:30am to 6pm for his alleged role in the theft of a ‘bir’ (copy) of Guru Granth Sahib from a gurdwara at Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village on June 1, 2015, and the subsequent sacrilege incidents. Official sources said Ram Rahim was also quizzed about the whereabouts of three dera’s national committee members, wanted in sacrilege cases. SIT head Surinder Pal Singh Parmar said Ram Rahim’s interrogation went well and will expedite the investigations. “During the interrogation, some crucial information has come to the fore. We will file a complete report to Punjab and Haryana high court on November 12. We questioned him for around seven hours on the basis of evidence on record,” he added. Last month, a Faridkot court had issued production warrants against Ram Rahim in a case of sacrilege in 2015. The Punjab and Haryana high court, however, directed Punjab Police to grill Ram Rahim in Rohtak jail itself, if it so desired, and directed jail authorities to make arrangements for the SIT to question dera head. In July 2020, after the arrest of seven dera followers, the SIT-led by former inspector general of police Ranbir Singh Khatra had named Ram Rahim and dera’s three national committee members—Sandeep Bareta, Pardeep Kler and Harsh Dhuri—as accused in the Burj Jawahar Singh Wala sacrilege case. The ‘bir’ was stolen from Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village gurdwara on June 1, 2015. On October 12, 2015, torn pages of the ‘bir’ were found scattered in the adjoining Bargari village, resulting in an outrage across the state and death of two Sikh protesters in police firing. The SIT in its charge sheet had claimed that it was Ram Rahim who ordered to carry out sacrilege to avenge insult of sect followers by a Sikh preacher.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/2015-sacrilege-cases-got-some-crucial-info-says-sit-after-ram-rahim-s-questioning-101636401602004.html

The worst-hit area of the tricity, Mohali recorded 604 new cases in the week ending on November 7, a 5% increase from 575 cases in the previous week.So far, the district has recorded 33 fatalities, which is also the highest in the tricity. Among the 33 deaths recorded this year, 29 took place in October alone and two each in September and November. The victims include a 15-year-old boy from Kharar who died at a private hospital on November 5 and whose death was added to the tally on Monday. Mohali civil surgeon Dr Adarsh Pal Kaur said people suffering from fever are not reporting to hospitals on time. “We are organising awareness camps, but people are not cooperating, which is resulting in the rise in cases.”She said all private hospitals and labs must report any suspected or confirmed dengue cases to the health department immediately so that remedial measures can be taken without any delay. There are three labs for confirmation of dengue cases at government hospitals in Mohali, Kharar and Dera Bassi, she said. District epidemiologist Dr Vikrant Nagra said that during the visit to high-risk areas in Zirakpur, Balongi, Dera Bassi and Phase 7 in Mohali, it was found that a lot of plastic waste, especially empty bottles and disposable glasses, are scattered around. He said plastic waste is the most suitable breeding site for mosquitoes as rainwater gets collected in them. Similarly, many people have stored large quantities of water in homes where mosquito larvae are breeding. Meanwhile in Chandigarh, 170 dengue cases were reported this week, against 274 cases recorded from October 25 to October 31. On the other hand, Panchkula recorded 111 cases this week as compared to 137 cases in the previous week. Health experts believe that the cases will further dip in the coming days.“The temperature is now dipping gradually, making unsuitable conditions for mosquito breeding. Besides cases, the new admissions of dengue patients in the hospitals have also dipped. Till last week, around 300 patients were admitted on stretcher trollies in the hospital’s emergency ward, with most of them complaining of fever and dengue. At present, only 60 dengue patients are admitted,” said Dr Sudhir Garg, medical superintendent, Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/weekly-dengue-count-goes-up-5-in-mohali-101636401491980.html

In 2018, members of the Purab Premium Allottee Association had lodged a complaint with the VB alleging that Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) had used sub-standard material in the construction of the apartments. Whatever they promised in the brochure before they had invited applications were not there in the detailed notice inviting tenders (DNIT). They had also raised objections against a huge financial irregularity during the construction, following which the samples were taken in December last year. The association alleged that in the brochure it was stated that there would be no water tank on the roof and 24X7 pressurised water supply would be available. As per the brochure, all towers should be separated, but GMADA has joined six to eight towers together and there are 27 towers and four blocks. Harvinder Pal Singh, DSP, vigilance said, “We have got the results of most of the samples and now we have sent that to the technical teams to verify. We are hopeful of getting them soon following which action will be taken.”Col Dalwinder Singh (retd), general secretary of the association, said, “We are fighting for the justice of the residence since 2018, but still vigilance reports are awaited. We have even raised the issue on the public grievance portal of both state and Centre governments, still, we are waiting for the reply. It seems GMADA officials are trying to influence the progress of the investigation.” In 2016, the GMADA had constructed 1,620 apartments of three types in Sector 88. Of these, 980 houses have already been allotted of which around 800 allottees have taken possession. The project has 27 towers of 60 flats each, a community centre and a sports complex with indoor and outdoor sports facilities.There are around 800 flats that are also falling into disrepair due to non-occupation and use. Further, there have been many incidents of violence and affray in the recent past in the complex. The contract of the project was given to Simplex Infrastructure Private Limited. Residents of Purab Premium Apartments, Sector 88, Mohali, have alleged that due to the blockage of rainwater drainage and waterlogging, several dengue cases have been reported in the area. Also, the supply of drinking water is directly from the bore well, which is a health hazard for the residents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/purab-premium-apartments-punjab-vigilance-yet-to-submit-report-101636401488128.html

Moreover, the institute has started a faculty appraisal programme through an external peer review committee with a target of 100 IPR which includes patents, copyrights and design patents.Focus on improving rankingsThe institute has also initiated a process to improve its rank in the education ministry’s national institutional ranking framework (NIRF). “We have analysed that we need to improve our research to perform better in the NIRF rankings,” he said.“Now we have introduced that for getting an A+ grade in masters, a student has to publish one research paper in SCI journal. Similarly, a PhD scholar has to publish one research paper in the second to third year,” he added.Setia said he would propose a policy change in which a PhD thesis would be sent abroad for evaluation, but the proposal needed approval from the PEC senate for implementation.President Ram Nath Kovind to visit PECPresident Ram Nath Kovind will visit the campus as a part of completing 100 years of PEC. Although no date has been finalised yet for his visit, it is expected to be on November 16. He will inaugurate a centenary gate, centenary hall, semiconductor lab and a hostel block at PEC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pec-completes-100-years-president-ram-nath-kovind-to-visit-college-101636401485875.html

It is the highest package so far this year, and the amount has in fact gone up from that offered in the past years. In 2020, eight students were offered ₹42 lakh per annum by Microsoft. The US-based technology giant had offered the same package to five students in 2019.The news brings a ray of hope amid a volatile job market due to the Covid-19 pandemic.The placement drive for the current session (2021-22) is currently underway, and around 450 students have received job offers so far. The placement drive will continue till March next year. According to the institute, there are around 650 students in the final year, and many skip the placement drive as they go for higher studies.The placements have been mainly conducted online due to the pandemic, but PEC has requested some of the companies to conduct physical placement drives as well.132 pre-placement offersPEC director Baldev Setia said the internship programme saw a 13% rise in internship offers in 2020-21, which stands at 314. “These internships resulted in 132 pre-placement offers, which is a phenomenal rise of 32% as compared to the previous year. Many students from different departments are also accepted for research internships in foreign universities,” he said.Among the students who have been offered the job by Microsoft is 22-year-old Akshit Garg. “It is a great achievement for me and I dedicate this to my parents. I worked consistently for it and it is a dream come true,” said Garg, who resides in Sector 15, Panchkula.“The placement numbers at PEC drive their strength from the talent pool of its student, its highly motivated faculty and its outcome-based curriculum,” said Dr JD Sharma, head, career development and guidance centre, PEC. Throwing light on the trend in jobs, he said that the pandemic has led to more opportunities in consulting, analytics and finance profiles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/16-pec-students-bag-46-lakh-yearly-package-at-microsoft-101636401484548.html
09-11-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Ward No. 1 rues new taxes, old plight||Provision of basic amenities, expansion of lal dora and better sanitation are key issues concerning voters in the newly constituted Ward No. 1 of the Chandigarh municipal corporation.Four of the ward’s five main constituents — villages Kaimbwala, Khuda Ali Sher, Khuda Lahora and Khuda Jassu — will take part in the MC elections for the first time. The panchayats were disbanded in 2018 and villages came under the jurisdiction of the MC thereon. The fifth major constituent, Khuda Lahora Colony, was previously under Ward No. 2.These peripheral villages, abutting Punjab, are located in the northern part of the city.A visit to the ward makes it obvious that even though part of the City Beautiful, these areas continue to struggle with even basic infrastructure. Residents complain that even after these areas were brought under the MC three years ago, there has been no major improvement in infrastructure and municipal officials remain unresponsive to their needs and complaints. Kamal Tewari, a trader based in Khuda Jassu, said: “Road repair work has not been taken up for years now. Similarly, the sewage system is not adequate, particularly when compared to the city.”Issues aplentyResidents also complain that imposition of different MC taxes has not brought corresponding quality services. Ram Karan, secretary, Chandigarh Congress, and a resident of Kaimbwala, said: “At the time of bringing these villages under the MC, residents were assured that new taxes will be imposed with corresponding improved basic amenities, but this hasn’t happened. Only the tax burden has increased. Sanitation, including garbage collection, is very poor and there is no effort to keep the villages clean. With the election on mind, the BJP-ruled MC has now started laying water supply lines.”The recent imposition of garbage collection charges has particularly upset the residents. Gurpreet Singh, a businessman based in Khuda Ali Sher, said: “The MC is collecting three to four times higher garbage collection charges. Residents’ complaints keep falling on deaf ears.”The long-standing demand of the villagers for expansion of lal dora remains unfulfilled. “The gravest concern for the ward residents is the extension of the village lal dora. Residents are facing multiple problems because of it. Some parts of the village, inside the lal dora, are with MC. Areas outside the lal dora are under the UT administration,” said Daleep Kumar Sona, a district president of Chandigarh BJP and resident of Kaimbwala.Seasonal flood control is specific problem in Khuda Lahora Colony, where residents have been for long demanding cleaning of Patiala Ki Rao rivulet and construction of road gullies in the colony.KNOW YOUR WARDLocalities: Kaimbwala, Khuda Ali Sher, Khuda Jassu, Khuda Lahora and Khuda Lahora ColonyReserved for women (general)Voters: 18,000 (approx)KEY ISSUESPoor infrastructure, including roads, sewage and water supplyExtension of lal dora, bringing in more people under MCPoor sanitation conditionWHAT RESIDENTS SAYArea within lal dora is under MC, and that outside is under the UT administration, leading to major problems for residents.

09-11-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh RWAs flag issues in park upkeep||The Chandigarh municipal corporation’s decision to increase monthly charges being paid for the upkeep of neighbourhood parks has received a mixed response from Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs).While some have welcomed the move, others say the hike is not enough and there are other issues that need to be resolved first.There are around 1,800 neighbourhood parks in Chandigarh. Of these, nearly 700 are being maintained by RWAs. The maintenance charges being paid to them had not been revised since 2013. Finally, the MC in its recent General House meeting approved the agenda to hike the charges from ₹2.48 to ₹4.15 per square metre.“Many RWAs are not able to get the full amount that they are entitled to. The MC also ends up deducting money alleging that the park is not well maintained even if it’s not the case,” said Hitesh Puri, chairman, Chandigarh Residents Association Welfare Federation (CRAWFED). Puri said there is also an issue with 2% tax deducted at source (TDS) on this amount, adding that it should not apply as RWAs are not contractors looking after these parks for the MC. He said once the new system gets implemented, the association will meet the MC officials to discuss the matter.‘Check shadow RWAs’Vinod Vashisht, convener of the City Forum of Residents Welfare Organisations, said that in some cases, parks have been given to “shadow RWAs”, which needs to be checked. “There are some instances where the upkeep of a park has been given to a RWA which only exists on paper. The MC needs to check the background of the RWA to which the park has been allotted to,” he said.Vashisht added that many RWAs also face delay in getting the reimbursement, which can sometimes take two to three months. Some parks in southern sectors are also without a tertiary-treated water connection and residents have to spend higher rates. ‘Need further hike’Vijay Chikarsal, who is the president of RWA in Sector 41A, said that MC needs to do more. A park in the sector was adjudged one of the best maintained ones in the city during the Rose Festival in 2020. “The rates need to be revised further. We have to take donations from residents to ensure that the park can be maintained properly,” he said. Gurbaksh Singh, 73, who lives next to the park helps maintain it. He said that he will have to pay from his own pocket even after the revised rates.Baljinder Bittu, chairman, Federation of Sector Welfare Associations Chandigarh (FOSWAC), said the MC should release the charges by the tenth of every month, so that the gardeners can be paid on time.‘Will ensure timely payment’“Issues like delay in disbursement of the maintenance fees were discussed in the MC House meeting as well. We will ensure that the charges are deposited into the accounts on time,” said mayor Ravi Kant Sharma. Sharma said the system will be fine-tuned and people should keep highlighting the issues. “Park maintenance is only given to registered RWAs and the registration process ensures that the association has an adequate number of members. However, if there is anyone breaking these rules, then a complaint should be made and we will look into the matter,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-rwas-flag-issues-in-park-upkeep-101636401481675.html

The newly elected MLAs -- Rohit Thakur (Jubbal-Kotkhai), Bhawani Singh Pathania (Fatehpur) and Sanjay Awasthi (Arki) --were administered the oath of office by speaker Vipin Singh Parmar at his chamber in the Assembly Complex in Shimla.

09-11-2021||Kolkata||Bengal BJP protest over state fuel tax stopped, told it violates Covid protocol||KOLKATA: The Kolkata Police on Monday did not allow a Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) protest to demand that Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress (TMC) slash the state tax on petrol and diesel, citing violation of safety protocols during the Covid pandemic.A few hundred BJP supporters, who assembled outside the BJP’s state headquarters at the narrow Muralidhar Sen Lane off Central Avenue, were not allowed to cross barricades set up by a huge police contingent. The state’s top BJP leaders eventually gave their speeches from a makeshift dais.“The Trinamool Congress (TMC) government cannot stop us with force. It has to follow the example set by other states and slash the local value-added tax (VAT) on fuel. Our movement will continue. We will force the government to reduce the VAT. We will also start an agitation demanding reduction in electricity price,” said BJP state president Sukanta Majumdar.BJP national vice-president Dilip Ghosh and leader of the opposition in the Bengal assembly, Suvendu Adhikari, were among the leaders who addressed the gathering. Majumdar announced that a one-hour public awareness campaign will be carried out at petrol pumps across the state on Tuesday. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee responded to her critics in her speech at a government programme to distribute awards among community Durga puja organisers.“The Centre raised ₹400,000 crore from tax on petrol, diesel and LPG but does not even give enough vaccines to us. In Bengal, we have cut taxes on diesel by a rupee. We are trying to do our best with limited resources,” said Banerjee.Refuting the BJP’s allegations that the government stopped its agitation, TMC state general secretary Kunal Ghosh said, “Bengal BJP leaders should collect information on Covid protocols from the Tripura police which stopped all our rallies in that state citing the same rules. Law does not vary from state to state.”After several BJP-ruled states such as Assam, Tripura, Goa, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat followed the Centre and reduced local taxes on petrol and diesel on October 3, the party’s West Bengal unit mounted pressure on Banerjee, demanding a similar step.Of the total taxes charged on prices of petrol and diesel in Bengal, the state’s share accounts for around 37%. In February, Banerjee reduced the state tax by a rupee per litre but there has been no further revision since then. The TMC, as well as opposition parties such as the Congress, have held demonstrations against the Centre on the price issue in recent months.The Centre announced its decision to reduce central tax on petrol by ₹5 and on diesel ₹10 on Diwali eve, a move that led to a decline in the retail price of petrol by ₹5.70 to ₹6.35 per litre across the country while diesel prices came down by ₹11.16 to ₹12.88 depending on the applicable state taxes.The Yogi Adityanath government in UP announced that prices of both fuels will be reduced by ₹12 per litre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bengal-bjp-protest-over-state-fuel-tax-stopped-told-it-violates-covid-protocol-101636400281589.html

09-11-2021||Other||Sacrilege cases in Punjab: SC seeks response on state’s plea in 4 weeks||Chandigarh The Supreme Court has issued a notice on a plea from the Punjab government, seeking a reply in four weeks. The plea has been filed challenging the April 9 order of the Punjab and Haryana high court directing the reconstitution of the Special Investigation Team (SIT) probing sacrilege cases.On April 9, the high court had set aside the challans presented by special Investigative team (SIT) in the Kotkapura firing case of 2015, that the Punjab Police had submitted in two FIRs registered in connection with the 2015 Kotkapura violence.The high court bench of justice Rajbir Sehrawat had also asked the Punjab government to constitute a fresh special investigation team (SIT), excluding former IPS officer of the rank of IGP, Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh. Though the state constituted the SIT, afresh in May 2021, it through the SLP had challenged certain observations of the high court.“The high court has erred in making several observations on the findings of the SIT about role of the persons mentioned in the charge-sheet, who were not parties before the high court. In doing so, the high court has virtually given a clean chit to such persons,” reads the SLP filed before the apex court. The SLP adds, “The HC made sweeping observations, attributing bias, to the state government purely on the basis of conjecture and surmise.”Former DGP Sumedh Singh Saini, former IGP PS Umranangal and former SSP Charanjit Sharma were among the seven accused against whom challan was filed by the SIT.Two people had lost their lives in the violence reported after incidents of sacrilege in 2015. Three FIRs on incidents of sacrilege were recommended for CBI probe in 2015 by the then SAD government, of which, the state passed a resolution to withdraw two FIRs in August 2018 under the Congress. In the same resolution, it also withdrew two more FIRs related to violence, entrusted to CBI barely four days before the move. There are a total of four FIRs registered to probe the incidents of violence.The high court order had come on the 2019 plea of Gurdeep Singh Pandher, a former sub-inspector with Punjab Police and then Kotkapura SHO, being probed in these FIRs, who had approached the high court levelling allegations against then IGP Singh and sought his ouster from the SIT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sacrilege-cases-in-punjab-sc-seeks-response-on-state-s-plea-in-4-weeks-101636399801453.html

Health minister Rajesh Tope tweeted: “Dr Pokharna, medical officers Dr Suresh Dhakne and Dr Vishakha Shinde, and staff nurse Sapna Pathare have been suspended. Staff nurses, Asma Sheikh and Channa Anant, have been terminated from their job . The action has been taken based on the information regarding the tragic incident of fire at the district hospital.” Eleven Covid-19 patients were killed in the fire which took place at 11 am in the ICU located on the ground floor of the district hospital on Saturday. As many as 17 patients, many of them senior citizens and some on the ventilator, were undergoing treatment in the ward when the fire occurred. Hindustan Times on Sunday highlighted a lack of funds that prevented the Ahmednagar Civil Hospital management from equipping the hospital with necessary fire safety equipment, though a fire safety audit was carried out in the facility. The fire brigade department’s audit, conducted between the last week of February and March, had recommended that a fire safety system with sprinklers and a pipeline be installed in the hospital. However, a lack of funds prevented the hospital administration from finishing the task. Barring fire extinguishers, the other safety measures that report had suggested after the fire audit were found missing when fire broke out. Earlier this year, there were a series of mishaps at various hospitals in the state. It included a blaze in a Sick Newborn Care Unit in Bhandara in which 10 newborn infants died after a fire broke out in the unit. In March, a fire in a Bhandup mall claimed 11 lives in a dedicated Covid hospital located inside the mall. In April, when a severe oxygen crisis had hit the country, a tank supplying oxygen to Covid patients on ventilators in a Nagpur hospital, leaked and led to the death of 24 patients||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/ahmednagar-hospital-fire-state-suspends-civil-surgeon-three-others-terminates-two-nurses-101636399501647.html

09-11-2021||Other||Colonisers submit memorandum to Chaudhary on NOCs||Ludhiana Claiming that the competent authorities were not issuing No Objection Certificates (NOCs) even for regularised plots and the process to register property was in standby mode, Punjab Colonisers and Property Dealers Association submitted a memorandum to All-India Congress Committee (AICC) secretary in-charge of Punjab affairs Harish Chaudhary in Patiala on Sunday. The association alleged that the state government had imposed restrictions on the issuance of NOCs, a mandatory requirement for registration. “Power connections are not being given to plot holders even after they have got their plots regularised under policy of state government in the past,” the members claimed, President of the association GS Lamba, claimed, “The bureaucracy is misinterpreting an order issued by the high court in the recent past and due to this the NOCs are not being issued against the plots, which have even been regularised under the regularisation policy. The PSPCL says power connection will be issued only after the coloniser gets the NOC for the entire colony. Why would the coloniser pay a fee to PSPCL separately, if he has already paid or is paying the regularisation fee to the government under regularisation policy.” Previously, the colonisers had also submitted a memorandum with chief minister (CM) Charanjit Channi during his visit to the city on October 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/colonisers-submit-memorandum-to-chaudhary-on-nocs-101636399141767.html

09-11-2021||Noida||Galand locals protest solid waste being dumped from Ghaziabad||Farmers and locals from about 20-25 villages held a panchayat at Galand village in Hapur and unanimously decided to not allow solid waste from Ghaziabad to be dumped in their area anymore. For the past month, locals have been protesting attempts by the Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation to dump Ghaziabad’s solid waste at Galand, which is a designated site for a waste-to-energy plant. The farmers and members of different associations held a panchayat at Galand where locals have also been staging a dharna for the past few days against attempts by the Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation to dump solid waste at Galand. “We have decided that we will not allow solid waste to be dumped in the area as it will lead to contamination and unhygienic conditions. This will affect our local population and also environment of neighbouring villages. We demand that administrative officers come and meet us over the issue and discuss our problems. The land given to the corporation was taken from farmers by the private developers. The farmers had no clues about the land usage,” said Rajiv Tomar, a resident and lawyer. The farmers said that people from different villages such as Galand, Masuri, Lakhan, Masoda, Hindalpur, Chhajarsi, Kheda, Basitpur, Kakrana, Dhabarsi and Fagota among others, participated in Monday’s panchayat. “We have called a mahapanchayat on November 21 when more people will join the protest. On Monday, about 1,200 people gathered from about 20-25 villages to discuss the issue. Till our grievances are heard, we will not allow any dumping of solid waste at Galand. When people in Ghaziabad are opposing the dumping of waste near their city, why should we allow Ghaziabad’s waste in our area?” said Sanjay Khori, gram pradhan of Galand village in Hapur district. The waste-to-energy plant is proposed over an area of 44.25 acres of land at Galand, which is currently owned by Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation. “We are working to resolve issues at Galand and several administrative steps are being taken. The waste-to-energy plant is proposed to process a capacity of about 2,500 metric tonnes of solid waste. Once it starts, it will process 1,500 metric tonnes of waste,” said MS Tanwar, commissioner of Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation. Ghaziabad generates about 1,200 metric tonnes of daily solid waste currently and the corporation faces a major challenge in its disposal as two of its landfill sites at Indirapuram and Pratap Vihar have been shut.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/galand-locals-protest-solid-waste-being-dumped-from-ghaziabad-101636398121403.html
09-11-2021||Noida||Worse post-Diwali pollution in past four years in Ghaziabad and Noida||Post-Diwali pollution this year in Ghaziabad and Noida has been the worst since 2018, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). Diwali was celebrated on November 4 this year.This year, Ghaziabad recorded an average Air Quality Index (AQI) reading of 449.4 from November 4 to November 8. Average AQI readings for the city for five days after Diwali (including the day of Diwali) in 2020, 2019 and 2018 were recorded at 302.6, 439.4 and 400.2, respectively.For Noida, the average AQI readings for five days after Diwali (including the day of Diwali) were recorded at 439.6, 298.8, 419.2 and 398.6 in 2021, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.An AQI reading between 0 and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.On Monday, Ghaziabad, as well as Noida, continued to record an AQI in the “severe” category with a reading of 437 and 412, respectively, while Greater Noida recorded a slightly better reading of 328 in the “very poor” category.According to CPCB figures, Greater Noida’s post-Diwali pollution this year was worse than last year’s with an average AQI reading for the five days after Diwali (including the day of Diwali) of 378.6, which is higher than the previous year’s average of 290.2.Officials of the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) attribute the scenario to adverse meteorological conditions and slower dispersal of pollutants this season.“The current wind speed is about 6-7kmph and has slowed down at night post-Diwali. Further, stubble burning started late this year and coincided with Diwali due to the prolonged monsoon season. Further, the count of stubble fires has spiked post-Diwali,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer, UPPCB, Ghaziabad, who is also officiating for Noida.According to official statistics from the Consortium for Research on Agroecosystem Monitoring and Modelling from Space (CREAMS) Laboratory of the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, stubble fire counts on November 4 (Diwali), 5, 6 and 7 totalled 3032, 5327, 3942 and 5199, respectively, in Punjab.The stubble fire counts were 228, 331, 219 and 182 on November 4, 5, 6 and 7, respectively, in Haryana.“So, all these factors affected the AQI this year. In the past two years, there has been a spell of rain post-Diwali, which brought down the pollution levels. Apart from the macro-level factors, vehicular pollution, dust and local pollutants also contributed to poor air quality this year,” he added.Environmentalists said that despite the efforts of different agencies, pollution levels failed to decline during the Diwali festival.“With adverse meteorological conditions, it will worsen further during the peak winter season. For the past several years, agencies claim that they have done a lot to combat pollution but the figures tell a different story every time. It also means that efforts have been lacking at ground-level and a detailed study of the NCR region needs to be taken up to assess causes of pollution and remedial measures,” said Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist.Steps to combat ‘severe’ airOfficials said on Monday that the sub-committee of the Commission for Air Quality Management in the NCR and adjoining areas directed taking steps to combat “severe” air quality in Delhi-NCR. “The commission in an order has directed us to take steps to combat ‘severe’ air, besides other directions previously given to combat ‘very poor’ and ‘poor’ air. It has directed increasing the frequency of road sweeping and identification of road patches with high dust-generation,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UP Pollution Control Board. The sub-committee, in an order late Monday night, also directed the closure of all brick-kilns and hot-mix plants and stone crushers in Delhi-NCR. The committee also gave directions to intensify public transport services while introducing differential rates to encourage off-peak travel. “We are forwarding the directions to different agencies in Ghaziabad and Noida for immediate implementation,” Sharma added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/worse-post-diwali-pollution-in-past-four-years-in-ghaziabad-and-noida-101636397943592.html

The devotees need water in the river to perform puja on November 10 and 11. So, we are expecting that by November 10, the water in the river will be cleaner,” said Rakesh Tiwari, national general secretary of Purabiya Jan Kalyan Parishad.The officials of the Uttar Pradesh irrigation department said that they released about 1,600 cusecs of Ganga water into the Upper Ganga Canal (UGC) on Saturday.The UGC was shut for annual maintenance last month. Water supply has now been restarted--water will reach water treatment plants at Pratap Vihar in Ghaziabad from where it will be supplied further to Ghaziabad and Noida. “We released the water into the canal two days ago. This will benefit thousands of devotees who perform the puja on the banks of the Hindon river. As more water flows into the river, the water quality will improve. Further, the plants at Pratap Vihar will also help resume Ganga water supply to Ghaziabad and Noida,” said NK Lamba, executive engineer of UP Irrigation department (Meerut).The devotees have also started preparing ‘vedis’ in the form of small temples made of mud on the banks of the Hindon river for performing puja.It is estimated that around 300,000 devotees will gather at the river banks. According to official estimates, 700,000 people from Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh celebrate Chhath Puja every year in the region. “There are about 400 families in our society who will take part in puja celebrations. For this, we have got the swimming pool cleaned up and we will start filling water in it from Tuesday. The pool was non-operational during the pandemic. This year, we are expecting more celebrations as the pandemic situation has eased up,” said Deepak Kumar, president of Amrapali Village high-rise in Indirapuram.“We will get the river banks cleaned up and readied for devotees. We are also installing CCTV cameras and setting up a control room at the site,” said Pramod Kumar, additional municipal commissioner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/up-irrigation-dept-releases-ganga-water-into-hindon-residents-call-it-filthy-101636397584456.html

Tiger and two of his accomplices -- Yashpal (who goes by his first name), 45, and Kapil Pehelwan, 40 -- had killed Manjeet Nagar, 40, inside his car in Greater Noida West on October 29 this year over a property dispute.Yashpal was arrested for his involvement in the crime on October 30.Harish Chander, deputy commissioner of police, Noida Central, said that Nagar, from Kheda Dharampura village in Badalpur, was a resident of Antriksh Golf View in Sector 78. He was found dead inside his Mahindra Scorpio near Greater Noida West’s Ek Murti. Police said he had five bullet wounds.A bottle of alcohol, two glasses and some snacks were also found in the vehicle. Police scanned call records on Nagar’s mobile phone and found that Yashpal had interacted with him on the phone that night.During interrogation, Chander said that Tiger revealed that Nagar and Yashpal used to be good friends in the past. “Yashpal took voluntary retirement from the Army a few years ago and started property dealing with Nagar. Yashpal had also invested his retirement money in the business. The two had decided to share the commission on the income. However, recently they developed differences as Yashpal believed he was not getting his due,” said Chander. Yashpal hatched a conspiracy with Tiger and Pehelwan to murder Nagar on October 29. The three suspects reached Sector 12 at night and bought some alcohol. “Yashpal called Nagar to meet him there. Nagar soon reached the spot in a Mahindra Scorpio and picked him up in the SUV. The two suspects – Tiger and Pehelwan – followed the Scorpio in a Tata Harrier,” said police. In Greater Noida west, Nagar stopped his SUV to have a drink, when Pehelwan, Tiger and Yashpal shot him dead. Police have seized the Tata Harrier and a licenced revolver from Tiger’s possession. A case has been registered against the suspects under Section 302 (murder) of IPC. “Tiger was produced in court and sent to judicial custody. We have launched a search for Pehelwan, who is on the run,” said the DCP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/greater-noida-45-year-old-man-wanted-in-property-dealer-s-murder-arrested-101636397581591.html

The donor is screened by a transfusion medicine specialist for his or her eligibility to donate granulocytes. Before the donor donates granulocytes, they are screened for infectious agents such as HIV, HBV, HCV, malaria and syphilis. The donor is assessed for his/her suitability. The donor is also given medication one night before donation so that granulocytes increase in his/her blood. The shelf life of these products after collection is 24 hours and they need to be irradiated before transfusion,” said Dr Satyam Arora, associate professor, blood transfusion department, PGICH.An apheresis machine is also used for platelet transfusions.“Till now, such a facility was not available at any government hospital in Gautam Budh Nagar. As a result, cancer patients who developed severe infections and required granulocyte transfusion, either had to be referred to a private hospital, or to KGMU and SGPGI in Lucknow,” said Dr Arora.There are around 400 children from the district currently being treated for various kinds of cancers at PGICH.Doctors say patients who suffer from neutropenia also require granulocyte transfusions.“Neutrophils, a type of granulocytes, make up 40% to 70% of all white blood cells in humans. The main function of neutrophils is to help the body fight infections. Cancer patients, especially children, often develop bacterial or fungal infections, which are difficult to treat with regular antimicrobial drugs. Patients suffering from blood cancer can also suffer from neutropenia, wherein the neutrophil count reduces to less than 0.5x109 cells per litre of blood,” said Dr Arora.The institute started the transfusion in July this year and so far, a total of five such transfusions have taken place here. Doctors said that none of the patients have reported an adverse reaction.Dr Arora added that the transfusion facility will help thousands of cancer patients in western Uttar Pradesh.“In future, PGICH’s capacities will be increased and it will cater to more patients in the region,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/granulocytes-transfusion-new-treatment-option-at-child-pgi-in-gautam-budh-nagar-101636397525469.html

Chanda went to Laxmi’s house and found that her door was locked from inside, and they were shouting at each other. The husband-wife revealed that Kundan recently lost ₹700 in gambling, which led to the quarrel. The duo did not open the gate and told my wife that they will come out after sometime,” Rajendra said, adding that Chanda had returned home after that.After half an hour, Kundan exited the house and escaped. “My wife visited Laxmi’s house again and found that she was strangled. We then informed the police and filed a complaint,” he added.Bhuvnesh Kumar, station house officer (SHO), Ecotech 3 police station, said a case was registered against the suspect under Indian Penal Code (IPC) Section 302 (murder). “The suspect was arrested from Bihar’s Vaishali on Monday, and was produced before a court and sent to judicial custody,” SHO Kumar said.1 held for stabbing shopkeeper in Greater NoidaOn Monday, the Ecotech 3 police arrested a man for stabbing a 25-year-old shopkeeper over a dispute on money transfer, said officials.The victim -- identified as Adesh Bhati, 25 -- is a resident of Kheda Chauganpur village in Greater Noida.

09-11-2021||Noida||Four-day Chhath celebrations begin in Gautam Budh Nagar||The four-day-long Chhath Puja festival began on Monday with residents in Gautam Budh Nagar performing the first-day ritual of ‘Nahay Khay’ (bathe and eat).Celebrated after Diwali, mostly by residents of Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh, Chhath Puja involves “arghya” (offering) by fasting women to the sun god in knee-deep water.While rituals are performed at home on the first two days of the festival, on the last two days of the festival, rituals have to be performed while standing in a water body.“On the first day, fasting devotees bathe, wear clean clothes and prepare a prasad (a devotional offering typically consisting of food) for the sun god. On the second day, devotees begin a nirjala (waterless) fast which lasts for 36 hours. On the third day, the fast continues and the setting sun is offered arghya in a water body in the evening. The fast continues through the night and on the fourth and final day, an arghya is offered to the rising sun,” said Munna Sharma, national president of All India Pravasi Mahasabha in Sector 75.The Noida Authority has identified nine spots across the city where artificial ponds have been created for devotees to perform the rituals.“Nine artificial ponds or water pits have been created in sectors 25, 45, 62, 63A, 71, 116, 120, 110 and 135. Clean water will be provided by the authority in these ponds and officials will oversee other preparations as well,” said PK Kaushik, general manager, Noida Authority.Alok Vatsa, president of Pravasi Mahasangh, which has been holding Chhath Puja celebrations in Noida for the last 15 years in Sector 25, said that like last time, no cultural events will be held this time either.“This is the second time that Chhath Puja will be celebrated during the Covid-19 pandemic. Until 2019, the Chhath Puja celebrations in Sector 25 used to be one of the biggest in NCR, with lakhs of devotees in attendance and performances by Bhojpuri artistes. However, since last year, the celebrations have been reduced to just performing of the rituals and this year too, proper Covid-19 protocols will be followed,” said Vatsa, a resident of Sector 33.In Greater Noida, the authority has created an artificial pond at the empty ground near Ek Murti intersection. Abhishek Kumar, president of Purvanchal Pravasi Ektamanch that holds Chhath Puja celebrations in Greater Noida West, said that residents have been advised to perform the rituals at home or in their respective high-rise apartments in order to maintain social distance.“Before the Covid-19 pandemic, Chhath Puja held at the artificial pond near Ek Murti chowk used to be celebrated by over 10,000 devotees. However, last year, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, people were advised to perform the rituals at home and only about 2,000 people turned up at the pond. Only some devotees who are unable to see the sun from their high-rise society, come to the artificial pond created here,” said Kumar, a resident of Greater Noida West.With increased pollution in the district, devotees are concerned whether they will be able to see the sun clearly.“Haziness in the air has increased after the Diwali festival and many devotees are concerned whether they will be able to see the sun clearly on the morning of November 11 when we have to break our fast after performing the rituals. During previous years too, we have faced similar issues hence we are praying that the sun is visible clearly this year,” said Madhu Mala Singh, a resident of Golf City, Sector 75, Noida.District magistrate Suhas LY said that authorities have been instructed to ensure proper Covid-19 protocols are followed.“All authorities have been instructed to ensure proper Covid-19 protocols are followed at the artificial ponds created for Chhath Puja celebrations. We hope residents behave responsibly as well,” said Suhas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/fourday-chhath-celebrations-begins-in-gautam-budh-nagar-101636397521345.html

Sail, who made his first appearance before the agency, was questioned in the Central Reserve Police Force’s mess in Bandra (West). He was accompanied by his lawyer Tushar Khandare. The NCB instituted a vigilance probe (referred to as a special enquiry team) under Deputy Director General Gyaneshwar Singh on October 25, following the allegations made in a notarised affidavit filed by Sail on October 23.In the affidavit, Sail claimed to have overheard a phone call between his employer Kiran P Gosavi — another witness in the cruise ship drug raid case — and Sam D’Souza. “You put a bomb of 25 crores and let’s settle at 18 final, because we have to give 8 crores to Sameer Wankhede,” Gosavi told a certain person named Sam D’Souza, the affidavit stated. Wankhede, the NCB Mumbai zonal director, had led the drug raid on the cruise ship, Cordelia, and subsequently arrested 20 persons in connection with the raid, including Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son, Aryan (23). The vigilance team arrived in Mumbai on October 27 and has recorded the statement of eight persons, including Wankhede and investigating officer V.V Singh.Wankhede was removed from the drug raid case on November 5, and a Special Investigation Team (SIT) of NCB Delhi led by Sanjay Singh took over the investigation of this case and five other cases.The vigilance team led by Gyaneshwar Singh visited the cruise ship and Tardeo, the area where Sail reportedly collected two bags containing ₹50 lakh from Shah Rukh’s manager Pooja Dadlani, as per the allegations made in his affidavit. The team also verified the place in Lower Parel where Dadlani, Sam D’Souza and Gosavi reportedly met to discuss the purported exchange of money. Wankhede has denied all allegations made in the affidavit as being baseless. The vigilance probe team left for Delhi on October 30 after Sail failed to turn up for recording his statement before them. On October 28, the NCB wrote a letter to the Mumbai Police Commissioner requesting him to ask Sail, who had appeared before a Mumbai police SIT (formed on October 28 to probe the allegations of corruption against Wankhede, Gosavi and others mentioned in Sail’s affidavit). However, Sail did not appear before the NCB and the team left for Delhi on October 30. It returned to Mumbai on Monday and questioned Sail. Gosavi was arrested by Pune city police in a cheating case registered in 2018 and currently in custody of Pune police. In his affidavit, Sail claimed that at 9.45 am on October 3 -- the day after the raid on the cruise ship Cordelia and hours before Aryan Khan and his friends were produced before a holiday magistrate -- Gosavi had met Shah Rukh Khan’s manager, Pooja Dadlani, along with Sam D’Souza outside Big Bazaar at Lower Parel. Sail’s affidavit stated that he was with Gosavi in an Innova, Sam D’Souza was in a separate vehicle that followed Gosavi’s, and Dadlani was in a Blue Mercedes.Gosavi and Sam met Dadlani in her car and left after about 15 minutes. Later in the day, when Sail and Gosavi were at the latter’s Vashi residence, Gosavi asked Sail to go to Tardeo and “collect cash of ₹50 lakh,” the affidavit stated. At a signal in Tardeo, a person driving a white car handed over two bags with money to Sail.Sail brought the money back to Gosavi’s Vashi residence. In the evening, Sail said that Gosavi asked him to hand the cash to Sam D’Souza. Sail gave these bags to Sam D’Souza at a five-star hotel where the latter counted the cash and found it to be ₹38 lakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/drugsoncruise-case-prabhakar-sail-questioned-by-ncb-s-vigilance-team-101636397463549.html

New vehicle registrations for the above period, across all the segments, dropped by half as compared to last year. This year a total of 7,741 vehicles were registered by the Pune RTO from November 1 to 6. Of which 4,873 were two-wheelers and 2,365 cars were registered. Whereas in the commercial vehicle segment, a total of 348 vehicles were registered and 134 autorickshaws were registered during the Diwali period. As fuel prices have gone up in last few months, people are now turning towards buying e-vehicles. According to statistics, this Diwali a total of 710 e-vehicles were registered by the Pune RTO. “The registration work was going on throughout the Diwali week and as per the data there is drop in vehicle sales in all segments compared to last year. Also, people are now moving towards electric vehicles as 710 electric cars were registered during the Diwali period,” said Sanjay Sasane, Pune deputy regional transport officer. “When we decided to get a new car our obvious choice was buying an electric car. We need to upgrade with the technology and already fuel prices have gone too high,” said Neeru Suri, who bought a new electric car. Pawan Dahinje, an automobile sales expert said, “There was a low response during the Navratri period for car sales and it continued during the Diwali period too. Last year, most people bought small cars. Now sales have gone down for cars, two- wheelers and even in the commercial vehicle segment.”Fatechand Ranka, president, Federation of Trade Association of Pune (FTAP) said, “This year’s Diwali festival and business around the festive period was quite satisfactory for traders and shop owners in Pune. We got a good response from customers and somehow managed to recover our losses of the last two years. It has just started and we hope that the business will increase in the coming months till Gudhi Padwa,”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/diwali-vehicle-sales-lower-than-in-2020-710-new-electric-cars-registered-at-pune-rto-101636397461725.html
09-11-2021||Delhi||The Uphaar victims will finally rest in peace after 24 years: Families||“I have kept the promise that I made to my children 24 years ago,” said Neelam Krishnamoorthy, who lost her two teenaged children in the fire at south Delhi Uphaar cinema on June 13, 1997.A Delhi court on Monday handed a seven-year jail term each to builders Gopal and Sushil Ansal for tampering with evidence pertaining to the fire incident which claimed 59 lives, and noted in a scathing verdict that their regrets over the incident were “hollow”. The court also imposed a fine of ₹2.25 crore each on the two. The court also cancelled their bail bonds, and directed that they be taken into custody immediately.“As a mother, I have succeeded and I have kept the promise that I made to my children 24 years back. The journey has not been easy. A lot of times, I was threatened, intimidated and often humiliated and mocked during court hearings, but the mother in me kept reminding me of the promise I made. Just because my children are not there with me, I have not stopped being a mother,” said Krishnamoorthy, who has become the face of the protracted legal battle waged by the victims of the Uphaar tragedy.Krishnamoorthy’s two children, Unnati (17) and Ujjwal (13), were among the 59 people killed, when a fire broke out at the cinema hall, during the screening of the film, Border.She said since then she has relived the “horrid day” countless times before the courts and the media, hoping that one day the narration of the day would become less painful. “That loss can never be replaced, but at least today the 59 victims will rest in peace,” she said.In 2015, after serving the first two years in jail, the Supreme Court allowed businessmen the Ansal brothers to walk free with a fine of ₹30 crore each, which was to be utilised to build a trauma centre in the city.In 2019, the court issued a non-bailable warrant against the two in connection with a case of alleged tampering with evidence. The trial court convicted the Ansal brothers and three others for tampering with the evidence on October 8, 2021, but reserved its judgment.Earlier, In 2020, the court dismissed a curative petition by a group formed by families of the victims, Association for Victims of Uphaar Tragedy (AVUT), to review 2015 judgment.In Monday’s verdict, the court finally sentenced the Ansals to seven years in jail, which, according to the victim families, is the first time in the country that someone is being convicted for the offence.Naveen Sawhney, who lost his 21-year-old daughter, Tarika, in the tragic incident, said the last two decades were extremely difficult for his family. But the Monday’s verdict has given them some solace.“After my daughter’s death, my wife was very disturbed. This incident has remained with us like a chronic wound. It gets particularly worse during her birthdays and other important occasions. This was a joint fight that all the 59 families fought together and we are happy to have got some relief,” Sawhney.Krishnamoorthy also said that Monday’s judgement has restored her faith in the country’s legal system.“This verdict was proof that you cannot cover up your sins with money and power, the law eventually will punish you,” Krishnamoorthy said.In his order, chief metropolitan magistrate Dr Pankaj Sharma said, “It is important to note that in a sentencing process, it is not only the crime that is important but the criminal and his/her circumstances are also equally important. The circumstances during which the instant crime was committed show the deep disrespect which the convicts had for the law and the judicial process and for the victims,” the court ruled.The magistrate said that “the foundation of judiciary is premised on the trust and confidence of the people and any action which is aimed to thwart the said foundation cannot be permitted and is required to be dealt with utmost strictness”.“This case is not only related to prosecution and Association of Victims of Uphaar Tragedy (AVUT) but the sentencing in this case must respond to the cry of the society,” he noted in the order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/the-uphaar-victims-will-finally-rest-in-peace-after-24-years-families-101636397101382.html
09-11-2021||Lucknow||Over 10-degree drop in UP min temp over a month as winter sets in||As Old Man Winter steps in, minimum temperature across Uttar Pradesh dropped around 10 degrees Celsius in a month, Indian Meteorological Department data read. The early morning temperature in Lucknow dropped to 14.3 degrees Celsius on Monday, which is a degree Celsius below normal.On October 8, the minimum temperature in Lucknow was recorded at 25.2 degrees Celsius. It dropped to 16.2 degrees on November 1 and has been on a slide since then. The maximum temperature has also dropped, the IMD data showed. On October 8, the maximum temperature was 34.5 degrees Celsius. It was recorded at 26 degrees Celsius on Monday.“The drop in average day temperature has been slightly lower as compared to the previous year. The drop, however, signals the onset of winter. We expect the temperatures to fall by at least 8 degrees more during this month,” said JP Gupta, director, state meteorological department.According to the MeT department, Lucknow may experience similar weather in till mid-week. “Lucknow and nearby areas will experience fog in the coming days, especially in the morning,” added Gupta.The minimum temperature has also dropped in several other cities of Uttar Pradesh as well. The night temperature in Varanasi dropped to 13.4 degrees Celsius which was two degrees below normal. With 12.6 degrees Celsius, Kanpur recorded one of the lowest temperatures across UP.The drop in temperatures will also impact air pollution levels in the state. Experts suggest that the temperature drop will make the state air pollution across UP worse in the coming days. “The drop in temperatures affects movement of particulate matter in the air which leads to rise in pollution levels. As the temperature drops across UP, the air pollution levels will spike,” senior environmentalist Sidhant Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/over-10-degree-drop-in-up-min-temp-over-a-month-as-winter-sets-in-101636396922474.html
09-11-2021||Delhi||At fault for a frothy Yamuna: Raw sewage, frothing agents||Poisoned by tonnes of sewage, industrial and domestic effluents, the Yamuna in Delhi is frothing -- one of the signs of the exceptionally high levels of pollution in the river.As Chhath Puja devotees took a dip in the river on Monday, iceberg like foam blocks were spotted floating on the river near Okhla Barrage, where the Yamuna leaves Delhi. The foam, experts said, is an annual phenomenon during winters, and is a clear symptom that indicates that the river stretch is “dead”.According to a report by a monitoring committee appointed by the National Green Tribunal in 2018, the 22-km stretch of the Yamuna between Wazirabad and Okhla, accounts for 76% of the total pollution in the river.River watchers and experts pointed out that the froth downstream of Okhla barrage has been occurring for more than a decade now but the magnitude of the problem has worsened in the last few years. Manoj Misra of Yamuna Jiye Abhiyan said the froth formation starts immediately after the monsoon, and as temperatures drop during November, the magnitude of the problem increases. “The froth formation is a clear symptom that the river in this stretch is dead,” he said.On Monday, Delhi Jal Board vice chairman Raghav Chadha said the neighbouring states have done little to prevent untreated sewage and industrial effluents from flowing into the river. Chadha said the Delhi Jal Board is working to enhance its sewage treatment capacity so that untreated effluents are not released into the Yamuna.“Okhla Barrage is managed by the UP Irrigation department and water hyacinth plants grow all around. These hyacinth plants decompose and release surfactants like phosphates. The paper and sugar industries operating in Meerut, Muzaffarnagar, Shamli and Saharanpur in Uttar Pradesh also release untreated wastewater containing surfactants, which is then released into Yamuna through the Hindon Canal near Indira Kunj,” he said.According to DJB estimates, the untreated discharge reaching the Okhla Barrage was 105 MGD (million gallons per day) from Haryana through Najafgarh drain, and 50 MGD from UP through Shahdara drain.When asked, a senior jal board official explained that froth is formed due to soap-like surfactant molecules. He added that when the water falls from a height in the Okhla barrage, it leads to churning of the polluted water, and amplifies formation of foam.“There are biological and chemicals reasons behind presence surfactant molecules in the river water. It can be due to detergents and surfactants in untreated domestic sewage, pollutants from industries as well as materials released by decomposition of dying water hyacinth weeds in the Okhla barrage,” the official said, asking not to be named.Similar toxic froth floating on lakes has been observed in the past in Bengaluru and Hyderabad.Last year, the NGT-appointed Yamuna monitoring committee took cognizance of froth formation in the Yamuna. Delhi Pollution Control Committee DPCC, in its report to the panel, blamed the presence of dhobi ghats, direct release of sewage containing phosphate and industrial effluents for the froth formation.A senior DPCC official, asking not to be named, said phosphates from detergents and soaps that are directly released into the river untreated results in the formation of foam. “To control this, the DPCC in June this year, banned the sale, storage, transportation and marketing of soaps and detergents in Delhi, which did not meet the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) norms. This was done to prevent frothing in the river. Directions were issued to the civic supplies department and surprise checks are also being conducted around the city for the same,” the official said.The official added that action was being taken against illegal industrial units operating along the Yamuna in areas such as Khayala, Bawana, Narela and Badli.Varun Gulati, an activist who filed a petition in the NGT against illegal industries, said most of these units were operating without any common-effluent treatment plants, or without licence.Misra said the high pollutant load shows how the city has failed the river. “We have seen that the river was much cleaner during the lockdown period when the household sewage was still getting added to river stream. If we can restore the river flow, as it happens during the monsoon season, and reduce the industrial pollutants, the river can be revived in this stretch,” he added.A senior DJB official said that under the short-term remedial measures, all water hyacinth plants in the Okhla pond area will be removed, and as an immediate measure bio-culture based foaming treatment may be carried out.“As a long-term measure, upgradation of all STPs by the UP, Haryana and Delhi is necessary to treat the waste water to substantially reduce the problem of foaming,” the official said, adding that it may take 3-5 years depending upon the availability of funds.Jyoti Sharma, head of FORCE -- a Delhi-based water conservation and sanitation organisation -- said Delhi has enough environmental regulations and laws but citizen participation must be ensured to improve water quality in the river. “We should have citizen vigilance groups who can help in monitoring of STPs, industrial area and slum cluster outfalls. Unless, we develop a participative oversight mechanism, such alarming sights will continue to be present,” she added.Health experts have warned that Chhath devotees should avoid this polluted section of river. According to Dr Rommel Tickoo, director, internal medicine at Max Saket, the froth caused by sewage and chemical pollutants can lead to gastrointestinal problems and water-borne disease such as typhoid.He added, “Skin can absorb pollutants which can lead to allergies and skin irritation, but long-term exposure to metals in industrial wastewater can cause neurological issues, hormonal imbalance and it can also be carcinogenic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/at-fault-for-a-frothy-yamuna-raw-sewage-frothing-agents-101636396801259.html
09-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt launches single window clearance, subsidy for two-wheeler EV charging points||New Delhi: The Delhi government on Monday launched a single window facility for installation of private electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in the national capital. For an electric two- or three-wheeler, an individual will have to spend only ₹2,500 for a charging point to be installed after the Delhi government’s subsidy, said transport minister Kailash Gahlot. “Delhi now hosts the cheapest EV charging facility you can find anywhere in the country. Apart from the 100+ public charging locations that are coming up, one can now install private EV chargers at a connection cost of just ₹2,500,” he said. The government said that the single window process is being made available both online and through phone call. On the directions of the Delhi government, power distribution companies have already empanelled 12 vendors to facilitate the installation of slow and moderate chargers. “The installation and operationalisation of these EV chargers would be completed within seven working days of submitting the request,” said Gahlot while addressing a press conference.The Delhi government will also offer a subsidy of ₹6,000 to the first 30,000 applicants for the installation of EV chargers in city, he said. The tariff rate fixed for electricity consumed through these EV charging points is ₹4.5 per unit. Jasmine Shah, the vice-chairperson of the Dialogue and Development Commission, said, “Such a facilitation process for installing EV chargers has been developed for the first time in India and with their widespread installation, Delhi will become the best city in the world in terms of accessibility to EV charging points. Today’s launch of a single window facility for installation of private chargers in malls, offices, residential societies, colleges is happening for the first time anywhere in India.”A consumer can avail the single window facility by either going to the respective discom’s portal or calling the following numbers: 7011931880 or 19123 (option 9) for BRPL; 19124 (option 9) for TPDDL; and 01135999808 for BYPL. The applicant can visit the portal and view trustworthy EV chargers that have been empanelled by the government. They can compare the price of these chargers and order them online or through a phone call. They can choose to opt for a new electrical connection (including pre-paid meter) to avail reduced EV tariff or can continue with the existing connection. The single-window portal allows the applicant to schedule the installation at their convenience. They can avail subsidy for light EV chargers up to ₹6,000 and pay the rest of the amount i.e. ₹2,500. They can also opt to pay the entire cost upfront or choose a monthly subscription payment model.The cost of the charger will be inclusive of the cost of the EV charger, installation and annual maintenance for three years. The Delhi government is anticipating that incentives will reduce the cost of chargers by up to 70% and it will provide additional revenue-generating opportunities for thousands of small shop owners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-launches-single-window-clearance-subsidy-for-two-wheeler-ev-charging-points-101636396741997.html
09-11-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: Industrialists’ protest over rising prices of raw materials enters Day 7||Industrialists performed an “aarti’ ceremony for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah and Union minister of Steel Ramchandra Prasad Singh on Monday, as their ongoing protest against the Centre over rising prices of raw materials entered its seventh day. They have been protesting for an hour everyday outside the United Cycle and Parts Manufacturers Association (UCPMA) on Gill Road. The industrialists stated that they are in talks with different industrial organisations and the agitation will spread across the state in the coming time.Seeking the formation of a regulatory commission at the Union level to keep a check on the rising prices, especially of steel, representatives of different industrial associations including UCPMA, Knitwear and Textile Club, Federation of Industrial and Commercial Organisation (FICO), Bahadurke Road Textile and Knitwear Association and Bicycle Research And Development Organisation (BRADO) have been participating in the protest. They have also declared that they will vote only for the party which will work to fulfil their demand. The industrialists rued that price of raw materials including steel, paint, nickel, fuel etc are being increased arbitrarily in the country, but the government is turning a blind eye towards the problem. Due to this, the industry is struggling to survive and forced to hike the prices of their end products. They stated that the prices of steel have almost doubled in the last two years.UCPMA propaganda secretary Rajinder Sarhali said that if their demand is not met, they will move the protest to Delhi in the coming time. Karwal extends support to industrialistsCongress in-charge of Atam Nagar constituency, Kamaljit Singh Karwal, extended his support to the industrialists and participated in the protest on Monday. Karwal stated that the Congress government has always stood by the industry and is continuously working for the betterment of the sector. He also demanded that the Union government take concrete steps to control inflation and prices of raw material.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-industrialists-protest-over-rising-prices-of-raw-materials-enters-day-7-101636396563341.html
09-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi adds 1,100+ dengue cases to tally, 3 deaths take toll to 9||The Capital added three dengue deaths to the city’s toll over the past week, as fresh infections more than doubled in the same period, according to the weekly report released by the city’s civic bodies on Monday.The city’s dengue tally crossed the 2,000 mark, as civic bodies added 1,171 infections on Monday, taking the year’s caseload to 2,708. The city added 531 deaths for the week between October 24 and 30.Nine people have died of the infection in the city this year. Six of them are children, said officials.Two of the three victims added to the city’s toll on Monday were below 18 – a three-year old girl from Saurabh Vihar (near Jaitpur) and a 12-year-old boy from Durga Vihar (near Sangam Vihar). Four of the five deaths recorded last week were also children.Experts say that this is because children are more likely to get the infection and suffer severe symptoms.“A higher proportion of dengue deaths in children is a reflection of a larger proportion of cases among them. Children between ages 8 and 15 are more likely to get the infection as they step out to play and go to school — exposing their chances of getting a mosquito bite. Children below the age of five do not usually get the infection because they mostly stay indoors,” said Dr Krishan Chugh, director of Fortis Memorial Research Institute in Gurugram.He added, “They are also more likely to die because their immune system is not fine-tuned and can react incorrectly, causing death, liver failure, and other such complications.”The dengue tally this year is on course to eclipse the 2018 number, when the city recorded 2,798 cases, and the toll is now the highest since 2017, when 10 died of the infection. Delhi reported its worst dengue outbreak in 2015, when 16,000 people were infected and at least 60 died, according to official records.There was only one dengue death in New Delhi last year, two in 2019 and four in 2018, showed the records.The nine deaths so far have all been recorded in September and October. But, to be sure, these are only disclosed later after a Delhi panel confirms their deaths were caused due to the vector-borne disease, and that the victims belonged to the city.The three deaths reported on Monday were among the nine being investigated by a death audit panel. According to senior officials from the municipal corporations, the panel is investigating a further 34 deaths from city hospitals. The other deaths that were confirmed to be caused“Most of the victims [those not added to the city’s death toll] outside Delhi, and came to the city to be treated. Most people who travel to Delhi for treatment reach by the time they have severe symptoms, and are more likely to die,” said the official.Dr Virendra Singh, professor, department of paediatrics, Kalawati Saran Children’s Hospital said the hospital has this year seen a comparatively larger number of children die of the infection, especially kids from Uttar Pradesh.“We are seeing otherwise healthy children being admitted with the infection, rapidly deteriorating and dying. Most of them die of multi-organ dysfunction and circulatory shock,” he said.With dengue cases on the rise, the Delhi government in mid-October made all vector-borne diseases such as dengue, malaria, and chikungunya notifiable, meaning all hospitals, clinics and diagnostic centres have to mandatorily report the cases. This was a long pending decision, with the capital aiming to eliminate malaria by 2022.Delhi government officials said they were using the provisions of new notification to ask hospitals for data on all fever cases along with hospital beds available for them to ascertain the availability of beds and the need for escalation.South Delhi mayor Mukesh Suryan laid the blame for the dengue deaths on the Delhi government.“The onus of all the [dengue] deaths recorded in Delhi so far this year lies with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)-ruled Delhi government. Despite a huge surge in dengue cases this year, we don’t have any funds to tackle this situation. It is really sad that three people lost their lives due to dengue. It was the responsibility of the state government to save their lives,” he said.Refuting Suryan’s allegations, Prem Chouhan, the leader of opposition in the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC), said municipal bodies were responsible for the control of vector-borne diseases in their jurisdictions.“The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led municipal bodies want to hide all their failures, blaming the Arvind Kejriwal government. Neither do they want to perform, nor do they let others perform. Forget about government, every worker of our party is ensuring repeated fogging in all critical areas,” he said.Abhishek Dutt, the Congress leader and Andrews Ganj councillor, accused both BJP and AAP of the failure in tackling the spread of dengue in Delhi. “The fact is that neither of these parties can turn their back on their responsibilities. Instead of diverting the attention of the people with their catfight, they must perform at the ground level for the people’s suffering. Our party workers are repeatedly fogging on bikes and bicycles in different areas,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-adds-1-100-dengue-cases-to-tally-3-deaths-take-toll-to-9-101636396443267.html

09-11-2021||Bhopal||‘Bania and Brahmin in my pocket’: Row over MP BJP leader’s controversial remark||Bharatiya Janata Party’s Madhya Pradesh in-charge Murlidhar Rao stoked a controversy by saying that he keeps Baniya (business community) and Brahmans (priest community) in his pockets. While talking to reporters on Monday, Rao said he keeps Banias in one pocket and Brahmins in the other. Rao’s remarks came in response to a question. “If you have asked the question, then listen to the answer, among my vote bank, my workers, and my leaders there were Brahmins, so it was called Brahmin party. When the Banias came, it became a party of the Banias. The party was started for everyone but it had more people from some communities at that time, so you used to say that this party belongs to them. We are working to make ourselves a party for all.” The Opposition attacked Rao for insulting the upper caste by saying that they are in his pockets. MP state Congress president, Kamal Nath, said, “Rao insulted the communities by claiming that they are like their ancestral property. The leaders of these communities made their important contributions in taking the party ahead. What kind of respect are party leaders giving to these leaders? This is the arrogance of BJP leaders and they are openly insulting communities for winning elections.” Rao should apologise, he added. Rao later clarified that the BJP is a party that never discriminates against anyone. “Congress always distorts facts. Kamal Nath is doing the same thing once again, the Congress is not able to digest that we won the trust of the tribals and other sections through our development work,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/bania-and-brahmin-in-my-pocket-row-over-mp-bjp-leader-s-controversial-remark-101636396141940.html
09-11-2021||Delhi||Neighbour held for acid attack on woman who spurned his proposals||A 23-year-old woman was left critically injured and fighting for her life after her 26-year-old neighbour allegedly tied up her up and threw acid on her at his home in outer Delhi’s Bawana on Diwali eve (November 3). Police said the suspect, identified as Montu, was allegedly stalking her and pestering her for marriage, even though she was already married and living with her husband. He fled to his home town in Bihar’s Buxar after assaulting the woman and he was arrested on November 6 from there and brought to Delhi, the police said on Monday.During his interrogation, the police said Montu also disclosed that he had planned to shoot dead the woman, if her husband proved a hurdle between them. To execute his murder plan, Montu also procured a countrymade pistol, which he allegedly hid in a secluded place in Bawana. The police team took him to the spot he mentioned to recover the weapon, but when they reached there, Montu allegedly retrieved the gun from behind the bushes and fired at the police team. Stunned by the sudden attack, the policemen returned the fire and the bullet hit Montu in the leg, said deputy commissioner of police (outer-north) Brijendra Kumar Yadav.Outlining the sequence of events, the police said on November 3, the Bawana police station received information that a woman was attacked with acid by her neighbour at his room in Sector 3, Bawana. She was admitted to a nearby hospital in a critical condition, they said. “Three policemen donated blood to the woman as her condition was serious and she is still under close observation at the hospital,” said a senior police officer associated with the case, asking not to be named.The woman’s statement was recorded and a case of voluntarily causing grievous hurt by use of acid was registered under Section 326A of the India Penal Code (IPC) against Montu. In her statement, the woman said she lived with her husband in Bawana. Her neighbour Montu started talking to her and expressed his love for her. On several occasions, he asked her to marry him. However, she flatly refused and told him that she was happily married, the officer said.“As Montu began pestering her for marriage, the woman shifted to another area in Bawana with her husband. But that did not help much as Montu too shifted to their new neighbourhood,” the officer said, requesting not to be named.On November 3, the officer, quoting the woman’s statement, said Montu called her to his room on some pretext and asked her to leave her husband and live with him. When the woman refused and reprimanded him for stalking her and troubling her, Montu became furious and overpowered her. He forcibly tied her hands and threw acid on her before fleeing the room. The woman screamed in pain and was rescued by neighbours. She was admitted to a nearby hospital, the officer said.“Through technical investigation, we found out that the suspect was in Buxar and arrested him from there. He confessed to the crime and said he attacked the woman because she refused to marry him. He revealed that apart from the acid attack, he had also planned to shoot her dead if her husband came between them,” DCP Yadav said.The police said a separate case of attempt to murder and attacking the police personnel on duty was registered against Montu in connection with the firing incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/neighbour-held-for-acid-attack-on-woman-who-spurned-his-proposals-101636396081030.html
09-11-2021||Delhi||DA hike: Delhi increases minimum wage; to provide workers access to govt schemes||Dearness allowances for unskilled, semi-skilled and other workers in the city were increased on Monday, a move that will increase minimum wages by nearly a percent, said deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, as he introduced a new programme to ensure that the benefits of all welfare initiatives reach the city’s registered construction workers. “I have issued an order to increase the dearness allowance of unskilled, semi-skilled and other workers of Delhi on Monday. Along with this, I have also directed to ensure payment to all workers and employees at the increased rate effective from October 1,” said Sisodia. “We also launched the Shramik Mitra scheme on Monday to ensure that the benefits of government schemes reach all construction workers in Delhi. Under this scheme, 800 shramik mitras will reach construction workers at their doorstep, inform them about the schemes launched by the Delhi government in the interest of the workers, connect them with relevant government schemes and ensure that no worker is left out of government schemes or deprived of any assistance,” he said. After the increase in the dearness allowance, the monthly salary of unskilled labourers has increased from ₹15,908 to ₹16,064, of semi-skilled workers has increased from ₹17,537 to ₹17,693, and for skilled workers from ₹19,291 to ₹19,473.

09-11-2021||Delhi||800 ghats set up in Delhi for Chhath Puja, says Manish Sisodia||Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Monday announced that the Delhi government, on the directions of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, has set up at least 800 ghats across the national capital for devotees to perform Chhath Puja rituals.Addressing a digital press briefing, Sisodia said the Delhi government has made several arrangements such as putting up tents, installing lights and making drinking water arrangement on the ghats. “Before 2015, Chhath Puja was organised only at 80-90 ghats, only a select few from BJP-Congress could use these ghats. Once the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) came to power in Delhi, the number of ghats were increased exponentially because the AAP cares for the Purvanchali population of the city. This time, despite Covid-19, the Delhi government has made grand arrangements for Chhath Puja at more than 800 ghats,” he said.Appealing to the people to practice caution, Sisodia said Covid-19 cases have gone down but the pandemic is not yet over. “It is a humble request to all the devotees to take precaution to protect the community from the virus. Following the personal efforts of Kejriwal, the lieutenant governor (LG) was compelled to give permission to organise Chhath Puja in public. Kejriwal had written a letter to the LG on October 14, demanding permission to organise Chhath Puja,” he said.On September 30, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) banned Chhath Puja celebrations in public, even as it allowed Durga Puja and Dussehra with restrictions. This led to protests by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Sisodia wrote to Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya on October 12, urging the Centre to issue guidelines for the Chhath festival as soon as possible following consultation with health experts.He wrote that Chhath is celebrated especially by “people from Purvanchal” with “deep faith and sacrifice.” “It is also celebrated very dedicatedly in Delhi every year. This year too Purvanchali people are eagerly awaiting celebrations of Chhath with their families and dear ones,” he added.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal also wrote to the LG, who is the DDMA chairperson, to allow members of the Purvanchali community to celebrate Chhath with Covid protocols.The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on October 28 allowed the celebration of Chhath Puja in public at designated places with Covid-19 protocols in place. It directed, however, that celebrations should not be held along the river banks.In the last decade, Chhath has become one of the major festivals in Delhi with the Purvanchalis -- people belonging to areas known as the Purvanchal -- accounting for over one-third of Delhi’s population of around 20 million, according to government estimates and migration data from Census 2011.Earlier on November 5, the Delhi government declared November 10 as a public holiday this year on the account of Chhath Puja.The festival began Monday with the ‘Nahai Khai’ ritual and will conclude on November 11 with devotees performing ‘Usha Arghya’ (prayers to the rising sun). The main celebration is on November 10 when devotees will offer ‘argha’ to Sun god.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/800-ghats-set-up-in-delhi-for-chhath-puja-says-manish-sisodia-101636395001065.html

Several patients are feared stuck inside the building. Fire brigade reached the spot and rescue operations are underway.Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan confirmed the deaths and said it was unfortunate to lose three children, who were already serious and admitted at the critical ward of the hospital.“The incident of fire in the child ward of Kamla Nehru Hospital, Bhopal is sad. The rescue operation was held swiftly. A high level inquiry has been ordered into the incident. The probe will be done by ACS Public Health and Medical Education Mohammad Suleman,” the chief minister said."The fire was brought under control, but unfortunately the three children who were already seriously ill could not be saved. The untimely departure of children from the world is an unbearable pain. I pray to God for the peace of the departed souls. My deepest condolences to the families of these children. Those who have been injured in the incident, get a speedy recovery, this is my wish," he added.Meanwhile, parents of children admitted to the hospital kept waiting for information. "We have no information of our children, it's been 3-4 hours," parents who were waiting outside the Kamla Nehru Hospital told news agency ANI. State health and education minister Vishvas Sarang reached the spot to take stock of the incident.Former chief minister Kamal Nath also condemned the incident terming it “very sad” and urged the government to make necessary arrangements and expedite the rescue and relief work. “The families of the admitted children are suffering,” he said.

09-11-2021||Delhi||Few attend in-person lessons as schools reopen after break in Delhi||A number of private schools reopened on Monday for students below Class 9 for the first time in nearly 19 months but attendance remained low as several parents were wary of sending their children to attend offline sessions. While the Delhi government had permitted schools in the national capital to restart physical sessions for students in all classes from November 1, many schools put off the reopening on account of Diwali break.Laksh Vir Sehgal, principal of Bal Bharati Public School on Ganga Ram Hospital Marg, said that a large number of students had not turned up on the first day of school reopening. “We had received consent from around 35% parents but for the first day, the attendance was less. Only around 15-20% of children were present today,” said Sehgal. He added that the attendance was expected to improve in the coming days since more children were likely to join after the Chhath festival that falls on Wednesday. “The attendance was less possibly because it’s only the first day of reopening. Another festival is also coming up on November 10 due to which students might have stayed away. Another reason could be that we have not been able to provide a transport facility as of now,” said Sehgal. The school is collecting fresh details from students and will be redoing routes based on the strength of students interested in availing the bus facility. The school is following a blended learning model and will utilise the first few days to familiarise students with their teachers and fellow classmates. “Students have come to the school after so long. Some of them will be meeting their teachers in person for the first time. The focus will be on interactions so that teachers can know students better and understand their learning gaps. If there are any deficiencies, we will work towards fulfilling them,” said Sehgal. Sudha Acharya, the chairperson of the National Progressive School Conference (NPSC) which has 122 Delhi schools under its umbrella, including Sardar Patel Vidyalaya, Bal Bharati Public School, Springdales School, Sanskriti School, Delhi Public Schools, Ahlcon International School, and Amity International School, said that a number of schools had reopened for children in all classes. “Children are back in schools after a long time and were visibly happy to meet their teachers and friends. We are all very happy to have our students back. In my school, we saw around 50% students in all grades including nursery,” said Acharya, principal of ITL Public School, Dwarka. The school conducted activities such as music, dance, and yoga to welcome students. A set of parents from each class was also called to visit the school and survey the premises. Sanya Mehta, a Class 4 student at the school, said that she had been eagerly waiting to visit the school for the past one and a half years and was happy to meet her friends on Monday. “Though around 10-15 students had come today, I had a lot of fun. I met my old friends and made a new one as well. We only took part in activities and I felt very happy,” said nine-year-old Mehta, who will be visiting school once a week, as per the roster created by the school for different sections. Nidhi Mehta, whose daughter went to school on Monday for the first time since the pandemic started, said that she was slightly hesitant though her daughter was keen on going to school. Mehta said that she was satisfied with the implementation of Covid protocols at the school. “My daughter was persistent and since transportation was not a problem for us, we were able to send her to school,” said Mehta. She said that other parents might have been reluctant in sending children to school due to concerns around transportation. Schools that did not reopen today will be doing so gradually in the coming week.Jyoti Arora, principal of Mount Abu Public School in Rohini, said that her school will reopen for in-person classes on Thursday after the Chhath festival. Some schools, that are yet to reopen for children in younger grades, are still continuing with practical exams for students in classes 9 to 12.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/few-attend-in-person-lessons-as-schools-reopen-after-break-in-delhi-101636394821388.html
09-11-2021||Delhi||Pollution-check measures amped up in Delhi as AQI improves marginally||The authorities on Monday upgraded pollution control measures in Delhi on Monday and introduced differential rates for public transport to encourage off-peak travel mandated under the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) as Capital’s air was recorded in the very poor zone after remaining severe for three consecutive days.The steps that also include closure of brick kilns and optimising power generation by gas-based plants are mandated under the Grap when air quality turns severe (when AQI value is more than 400 or ambient PM2.5 concentration 250 microgram per cubic metre of air).The sub-committee of the Commission for Air Quality Management for Delhi-NCR and adjoining areas (CAQM) met on Monday, and decided to upgrade the Grap measures from the current steps that were being enforced under the ‘very poor’ air category.Delhi’s air quality plunged into the severe category on November 5, a day after Diwali, with an AQI of 462 -- the highest for a day after Diwali since the records of AQI are being maintained. Scientists blamed blatant violations of the ban on bursting of firecrackers and the increase in the number of farm fires for the sudden spike in air pollution. On Saturday, Delhi reported an AQI of 437 and that of 428 on Sunday, when the share of the stubble fires reached the season’s highest at 48%.On Monday, the air improved a bit at AQI of 390 with wind speeds picking up and the share of stubble fires to Delhi’s PM2.5 pollution dipping to 30%, according to CPCB and Safar data.VK Soni, part of the sub-committee on Grap, said wind direction is expected to remain northwesterly over the next five days with local wind speed ranging between 6-10 km/hr. But, the share of stubble burning will remain high during this period. “Wind speeds will be between 6-10 km/hr over the next five days, but will become calm at night, causing air quality to decline. The air quality will fluctuate between the higher end of the ‘very poor’ category and the ‘severe’ category over these next five days,” said Soni.Prashant Gargava, member secretary, CPCB and chairperson of the sub-committee, said frequency of mechanized sweeping and road cleaning needed to be increased during this period. “The directions issued include the need to identify roads with high dust generation. We have also asked the NCR states to disseminate information on air pollution so that citizens can take steps to reduce air pollution,” he said.The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) and the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) did not comment on the latest directions to introduce differential rates.Forecasting agencies said while wind speed over Delhi remained around 10 km/hr on Monday, there was a drop in the speed of winds blowing from Punjab and Haryana towards Delhi, thereby reducing the contribution of farm fires to 30%. In contrast, the contribution of farm fires was 48% on Sunday, the highest so far this winter season.According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (Safar), a government forecasting body, around 4,189 fires were recorded in the northern plains on Sunday as compared to 5,430 fires on Monday. However, slow ‘transport level’ winds are playing a role in the reduction in AQI, the agency said.“Parameters have largely remained the same, but wind speed at the higher-elevation – which transports pollutants from Punjab and Haryana towards Delhi, is slow and has reduced the impact of stubble burning. If wind speed is slow, these pollutants are unable to complete the journey to Delhi and disperse during the journey,” said Gufran Beig, founder and project director at Safar.In its daily forecast, Safar said that the air quality in the national capital may improve slightly in the next 24 hours, but will still remain in the ‘very poor’ category.R.K Jenamani, scientist at IMD, said visibility ranged from 1000 to 1800 metres at both Palam and Safdarjung, with wind speed remaining around 8-10 km/hr during the day. “Like Sunday, visibility remained similar, but the minimum temperature was just 13.6 degrees Celsius. Local wind speed will remain in a similar range, with north-westerly winds continuing to prevail over the next 48 hours,” he said.Delhi recorded a minimum temperature of 13.6 degrees Celsius, and the maximum temperature was recorded at 29.2 degrees Celsius.Dipankar Saha, former head of CPCB’s air laboratory says the problem is not limited to Delhi, but the entire Indo-Gangetic Plain region, which needs to be treated as one large air-shed. “Emissions can travel a long range and distance if wind speed and wind direction are ideal. Satellite data will show a thick haze over not just Delhi NCR, but it spreads across the entire Indo-Gangetic Plain region,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/pollutioncheck-measures-amped-up-in-delhi-as-aqi-improves-marginally-101636394102220.html
09-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi: 28-year-old raped, assaulted in Dwarka hotel; manager held||A 28-year-old woman was raped and assaulted allegedly by a man who reportedly held her captive in a hotel room in Dwarka after taking her there on the pretext of offering her a job.The incident happened on Saturday and police had to break the glass door at the hotel entrance to rescue the woman who was locked up in the room by the accused before fleeing. Police said the woman suffered injuries to her face in the assault and may even lose her eyesight.Police have arrested the hotel manager for facilitating the crime and not rescuing the woman despite hearing her screams for help from the balcony of the room she was locked in, said senior police officers associated with the case.“The owner and other staffers of the hotel are absconding. Our teams are conducting raids to nab them as well as the prime suspect, identified as Ankit Sehrawat,” said a senior police officer, who did not want to be named.Deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka) Shankar Choudhary said that on Saturday, the Dwarka South police station received a call from a woman who alleged that she had suffered injuries to her eye after being assaulted by a man. “One head constable contacted the woman and she shared her live location with him after informing him that she was in some hotel. The head constable reached the hotel in Sector-9 and found the main entrance of the hotel, a glass door, locked and chained from inside. The woman was screaming for help in the balcony of the hotel’s second floor,” said an officer.When nobody opened the gate, police said the head constable broke the glass door using a stone and subsequently also broke open the door on the second-floor room to rescue the woman.Police said the injured woman was admitted to a hospital and her statement was recorded. In her complaint, the woman alleged that Sehrawat had contacted her on the pretext of providing her a job. She met him around 8pm on Saturday after which he took her to the hotel in Dwarka Sector 9 on a bike.“She initially refused to enter the hotel but Sehrawat assured her that he knows everyone in the hotel.. Sehrawat took her to a room and forced her to drink alcohol. He raped the woman and even tried to strangle her.

09-11-2021||Delhi||Chhath Puja: 2 BJP MPs visit Yamuna as political slugfest intensifies||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) stepped up attack on the ruling Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi over the Chhath Puja celebrations as two party MPs visited Yamuna ghats on Monday and criticised the state government for “prohibiting” prayers along the river banks even as deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia announced 800 spots have been prepared for the devotees besides other arrangements for the biggest festival of the Purvanchalis. The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), headed by Delhi lieutenant governor, on September 30 barred the festival in public places. However, the agency revised the order on October 28, and allowed the celebrations but stated that puja should not be observed along the river banks. West Delhi MP Parvesh Verma and Northeast Delhi MP Manoj Tiwari visited various ghats on Monday to assess the situation and plan for arrangements for the festival. Referring to the high level of pollutants in the river, the two MPs said that the Kejriwal government stands exposed on its false promise of “cleaning the river”. Tiwari, who visited the ghats at Kalindi Kunj and Sonia Vihar on Monday, said the Supreme Court should take suo motu cognisance of the situation, pointing to the thick layer of toxic foam in the river at Kalindi Kunj.Verma, the MP from West Delhi, performed puja at the ITO ghat on Monday and said all necessary arrangements will be made for the puja on the ghat on November 10, despite DDMA’s order. “The government should have put forward a proposal assuring the DDMA that all necessary arrangements, including Covid related protocols, will be put in place at the ghats. Earlier too, the government remained silent on the ban on Chhath puja celebrations. It is only after BJP raised the issue that the CM wrote to the LG,” said Verma. He added, “The CM should have got the entire Delhi administration to make elaborate arrangements for the festival. He doesn’t want people to celebrate this festival. But now we will make arrangements at the ITO ghat for the puja on November 10.” Northeast Delhi MP Tiwari, BJP’s Purvanchal face, has been vocal against the DDMA’s initial ban on Chhath puja in September, claiming that the festival was singled out even as Durga puja and Dussehra celebrations were allowed in the Capital. He has held protests against the ban. With municipal elections scheduled next year, the BJP is trying to woo the community that played an important role in AAP’s victory in assembly elections in 2015 and 2020. “Delhiites are breathing poisonous air and the water is polluted too. This is what Kejriwal has given in return to people for their support in assembly elections. They are not just playing with religious sentiments of people, but with people’s lives too… The permission for Chhath puja was denied at the banks of Yamuna as this would have exposed the government,” said Tiwari, adding that the puja should be organised at ghats, like in Sonia Vihar, where the water is clean. Chhath Puja is a community festival that involves worshipping the Sun and taking dip in a water body. It is popular among people from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand -- collectively called the Purvanchal region. People from these states form more than one-third of Delhi’s current population of around 20 million, according to government estimates and migration data from Census 2011.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/chhath-puja-2-bjp-mps-visit-yamuna-as-political-slugfest-intensifies-101636393441163.html

09-11-2021||Mumbai||PM lays foundation stone for road projects to boost connectivity in Maharashtra||Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi on Monday virtually laid the foundation stone and various road projects in a bid to boost the pilgrimage in Maharashtra’s Pandharpur. The projects are designed to facilitate pilgrims’ journey to Pandharpur, a town associated with Sant Tukaram and Sant Dnyaneshawar.The foundation stone was laid for the 221-km Sant Dnyaneshwar Maharaj Palkhi Marg between Diveghat and Mohol, and 130km Sant Tukaram Maharaj Palkhi Marg from Patas to Tondale – Bondale. The corridor is popularly known as Pandharpur Wari or the pilgrimage route. The project is implemented by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI). The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Central government used the event to score a point over the ruling dispensation in Maharashtra, as it invited the Union minister Bhagwat Karad, Bharati Pawar, Narayan Rane, and leader of Opposition in Maharashtra Legislative Assembly Devendra Fadnavis, who was present in person, while others were virtually present. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari participated in the function virtually.The ministry of road transport and highways, which is headed by Nitin Gadkari, had invited saints and seers associated with Pandharpur’s famous annual ‘waris’ or pilgrimage.PM Modi, during his 38-minute speech, spoke about the Hindu culture, Lord Vitthal, and about saints Tukaram and Dynaeshwar. PM’s speech was also peppered with Sanskrit slokas and a few lines from Marathi literature.As per the project, around 221km of Sant Dnyaneshwar Maharaj Palkhi Marg from Diveghat to Mohol and around 130km of Sant Tukaram Maharaj Palkhi Marg from Patas to Tondale–Bondale, will be four-laned with dedicated walkways for palkhi (palanquin) on either side, at estimated costs of more than ₹6,690 crore and around ₹4400 crore, respectively.Dedicated walkways for palkhi will be constructed on either side of these national highways, providing hassle-free and safe passage to devotees. The construction of Sreesanth Dnyaneshwar Maharaj Palkhi Marg will be done in five phases and the construction of Sant Tukaram Maharaj Palkhi Marg will be completed in three phases.During the event, the Prime Minister also dedicated to the nation more than 223km of completed and upgraded road projects, constructed with an estimated cost of over ₹1,180 crore at different National Highways for boosting connectivity to Pandharpur. These projects include Mhaswad-Piliv-Pandharpur (NH 548E), Kurduwadi-Pandharpur (NH 965C), Pandharpur-Sangola (NH 965C), Tembhurni-Pandharpur section of NH 561A and Pandharpur-Mangalwedha-Umadi section of NH 561A.Chief minister said that Gadkari’s expectation from the state government will be fulfilled. He said that it is the collective responsibility of both governments to develop the area. “It is the responsibility of all of us to develop the Palkhi Marg. It is our responsibility to remove obstacles in the way of our warkaris (pilgrims) irrespective of wind or rain. On this occasion, I would like to assure you that Maharashtra is with you every step of the way,” Thackeray said.Modi asked the villagers to plant trees on the pathway of the new highway wherein drinking water should be arranged. He also sought a promise from the locals that in the future Pandharpur will be the country’s cleanest pilgrimage destination.PM said that these projects will lead to better connectivity with the region. He paid his respect to the devotees, saints and Lord Vitthal for their blessings for the projects. He said that faith in Lord Vitthal remained unwavering throughout the turmoils of history. Modi said that the sentiments of his poll slogan, ‘Sabka saath-sabka vikas-sabka vishwas’ is the spirit of Lord Vitthal’s court which is open to all.“Even today, this yatra is one of the world’s oldest mass movements and is seen as a people’s movement, which teaches us that there may be different paths, different methods and ideas, but we have the same goal.” “In the end, all sects are ‘Bhagwat Panth, It is a symbol of India’s eternal knowledge that does not bind our faith, but liberates,” Modi added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pm-lays-foundation-stone-launched-road-projects-to-boost-connectivity-on-pandharpur-wari-route-101636383479164.html

However, no one was hurt in the incident, people familiar with the development said on Monday. The CIA wing office is located on the SBS Nagar-Jalandhar road, around 2.5-km from the district administration complex in the city. After the blast, the SBS Nagar has been put on a high alert and security beefed up. SBS Nagar senior superintendent of police Kanwardeep Kaur confirmed the development, adding that things will be clear soon as the investigations are on. People familiar with the development said it was probably a China-made low-intensity grenade and thrown from the periphery. It dropped at the office’s outer gallery, they said, adding counterintelligence officials and forensic experts were on the spot since Monday morning to collect evidence. The FIR registered on the statement constable Jagtar Singh, who, along with four others, was on the night duty, says the blast occurred near a water cooler near the head clerk’s (munshi) office. “We came out and found the window glass of head clerk’s office broken and water cooler lying at a distance from where it was fixed,” Jagtar told the police. The FIR states that the cops initially believed that the compressor of the water cooler must have exploded, but in the morning, when shrapnel were found in the vicinity, senior police officials were informed. Officials familiar with the investigation said CCTV camera footage and call details were being scanned. Police have registered a case against unidentified people under Section 307 (attempt to murder), 427 and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) and 3, 4 and 5 section of Explosive Substances Act at Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar police station (city).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/grenade-hurled-at-cia-office-in-sbs-nagar-no-one-hurt-101636380423960.html
09-11-2021||Other||Cost of electric vehicles will drop, will be on par with petrol in 2 yrs||Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari said the cost of electric vehicles (EV) in India will drop to the level of petrol vehicles in the next two years with the Indian government offering production-linked incentives and planning the installation of EV charging points at fuel stations and major highways of the country.This is significant because by 2030, India has set a target of 30% EV sales penetration for private cars, 70% for commercial vehicles, 40% for buses and 80% for two and three-wheelers.At present, only about two to three e-car variants cost below ₹15 lakh in the country. The cost of two-wheelers and three-wheelers in the electric segment has already almost come at par with the petrol variants after factoring in the subsidies.Speaking at a webinar on accelerating the phasing out of coal and switching to electric vehicles on Sunday, the Union minister said the government is also focusing on ensuring that EV charging stations get their electricity from renewable sources. He added that the government will also soon launch the country’s fully electric tractor. This comes months after Gadkari introduced the country’s first-ever tractor run on CNG.“Within two years, the cost of EVs will come down to a level that will be at par with their petrol variants. Already GST is only 5% on EVs and the cost of lithium-ion batteries is also declining. Besides, the government has already framed a policy allowing petrol pumps to set up EV charging stations. In two years, there will be a lot of charging points across India as well,” Gadkari said.The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has chalked out a plan to install at least 700 EV charging stations across its major highways in the country by 2023. These will be spread across a range of 40-60kms.Gadkari further said that a potential pilot project is being planned to install an electric highway system in the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway which can be electrified using abundant solar power energy in the region.“There is no benefit in producing coal-based electricity. Our attention is now on renewable sources such as solar, tidal, wind energy and biomass. Domestic EV charging can be fulfilled through rooftop solar system. The average retail electricity charge across the country is as high as ₹7-8 kWh, that of backup power with diesel generator sets is as high as ₹20/kwh. Meanwhile, solar power is less than ₹2/kwh today. So, a rooftop solar system can address the twin problem of high electricity cost and grid reliability,” he said.At present, India has the world’s fourth-largest renewable energy capacity at 145 GW. Gadkari said domestic EV charging through solar PV cells, panel systems at homes, malls, parking lots and offices would make EVs more affordable and adaptable.“Electric mobility is gaining good momentum in the country. There is no artificial push required. The per kilometre cost of petrol-based vehicles is ₹10, that of diesel is ₹7/km, whereas, EVs, it is ₹1/km,” the minister said.The country has seen an increased demand for small battery-operated vehicles such as e-scooters, e-carts, e-autos, e-bicycles in the past two years. Gadkari said India has the potential to become an exporter in these two segments of EVs. Electric two-wheeler and electric car sales have seen a rise of 145% and 190% respectively when compared to the pre-covid period....||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cost-of-electric-vehicles-will-be-at-par-with-petrol-variants-in-2-years-gadkari-101636375740433.html
09-11-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab deputy CM’s son-in-law appointed addl advocate general||Chandigarh The Punjab government on Monday appointed deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa’s son-in-law Tarun Vir Singh Lehal as an additional advocate general (AAG). Lehal is one of the five lawyers roped in by the state government for the advocate general’s office through a notification issued by the department of home affairs and justice on Monday.The government also appointed advocates Mukesh Chander Berry as AAG, Sumeet Mahajan as senior additional advocate general, Aadil Singh Boparai as additional advocate general, and Rehatbir Singh Maan as deputy advocate general. “These appointments shall come into force with immediate effect,” reads the government order.Jobs to relatives of Punjab ministers, legislators and senior Congress leaders have time and again created uproar in the state. In June this year, when the Captain Amarinder Singh-led government had decided to appoint the sons of Ludhiana North Congress MLA Rakesh Pandey and Qadian MLA Fateh Jung Bajwa as naib tehsildar and inspector, respectively, there was widespread criticism, especially from the opposition parties. In September, Randhawa had also raised questions over the Amarinder-led cabinet’s move to appoint then revenue minister Gurpreet Kangar’s son-in-law as an inspector in the excise and taxation department. “Those who deserve should get their due. But I feel before giving jobs to the kin of ministers, we should prefer general candidates. We are public representatives and should first think about the public and not our own kids. Yes, the boy who has been given job deserved this because his father had died, but our government should have extended this benefit at the time he had applied for the job,” Randhawa had said.The deputy chief minister couldn’t be reached for comment. However, a few TV news channels quoted him justifying the appointment, terming it “made on the recommendation of the advocate general and well within the legal framework”. Lehal, when contacted, said the appointment of law officers was the prerogative of the advocate general and “only he (AG) can comment on my selection”. “I am in practice for 13 years and the number of cases I have fought is also in public domain. One can check my profile from the high court website. What if I am the son-in-law of a minister?” said Lehal.In 2017, the Capt Amarinder-led dispensation had appointed former chief minister late Beant Singh’s grandson and brother of Ludhiana MP Ravneet Bittu as DSP in the Punjab Police.AAP, SAD condemn moveAam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Shiromani Akali Dal criticised the government over Lehal’s appointment as the AAG.AAP’s co-incharge for Punjab Raghav Chadha said the Congress is fulfilling its principal poll promise of ‘Ghar Ghar Naukri’ with some modifications. “Jobs are going to family members of Congress ministers and MLAs. Latest beneficiary is deputy CM’s son-in-law. CM Channi is essentially carrying forward the Captian’s legacy,” he said. Senior SAD leader Bikram Singh Majithia also condemned the Congress government, saying Ghar Ghar Naukri scheme was applicable only to the sons and relatives of Congress ministers and legislators. “Now it is deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa’s turn to take advantage of the VIP quota created by the Congress government,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-deputy-cm-s-son-in-law-appointed-addl-advocate-general-101636368537657.html

He was responsible for sending hundreds of people to Hungary with a promise to send them to America through Mexico. Many of these people have reportedly been missing and it is suspected that they have been victims of this Human trafficking racket. A senior official added that the role of singers is under investigation and the racket may turn out to be a fraud worth hundreds of crores. The role of the officials of the Hungarian Embassy is also being investigated. Verma also claimed to be close to a lawyer in Chandigarh. “Verma is also one of the accused in a bank scam involving crores of rupees and his house in Sector 8, Chandigarh, has also been attached by the enforcement directorate.

The Afghans, for their part, did not get it done either. It is simply very regrettable," she further said.Talking about the evacuation process in the country, Merkel said that Germany not only evacuated a large amount of staff from Afghanistan but also helped many Afghans who did not work with Germany but were active advocates of freedom and democracy in the war-torn Asian country, according to TOLOnews.Meanwhile, the Human Rights Watch feared that there would be an increase in child marriage across the country due to the lack of education and rising poverty, reported TOLOnews."Access to education is another issue. As you know, the vast majority of girls' secondary schools are still closed, and even primary schools that are open seem very low attended by girls and by boys as well--so a huge proportion of the children in Afghanistan are being denied the right to education at the moment. And this leads to another problem which is child marriage. We know that the combination of poverty and lack of access to education is driving up child marriage and we have also seen the incredibly disturbing reports about families selling their children--almost always girls--to pay for food," TOLOnews quoted Heather Barr at Human Rights Watch as saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/situation-in-afghanistan-very-regrettable-says-german-chancellor-merkel-101636457068631.html

There's a chance she will be reformed, and I couldn't help but to hesitate over choosing a death sentence," the judge said.Court officials were unavailable for comment on Tuesday afternoon.Japan, where more than 100 inmates await execution, is one of the few developed nations that still have the death penalty.Prosecutors had demanded a death sentence for Kuboki but the nurse's lawyers reportedly argued that she suffered depression due to stress over the deaths of her patients, and had diminished capacity.Kuboki had told the court she did not want to be blamed by family members when something wrong happened to her patients when she was on her shift, and felt "relieved" when one of the victims died, NHK said.The son of one of the victims said he was not happy with the ruling, according to the broadcaster."She killed innocent people with selfish motives and she's not sentenced to death. It's wrong," he said.Public support for capital punishment in Japan remains high despite international criticism, including from rights groups.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nurse-who-murdered-patients-gets-life-sentence-in-japan-101636453908148.html

It is the first time those with covert infections outnumbered those with symptoms during the broadest outbreak that China has experienced since the virus first emerged in Wuhan in late 2019. Of the 31 provinces on the Chinese mainland, 20 have reported infections caused by the delta variant, including the capital Beijing.China remains the only country in the world bent on weeding out every infection within its borders, defying a global trend of learning to live with Covid after more infectious variants rendered restrictions less effective and made eliminating it markedly more difficult. Mass vaccination and the rollout of booster shots have significantly reduced the burden of the disease, with the majority of fully vaccinated people developing mild or no symptoms if they contract a breakthrough infection.“It’s different now than a year ago because the consequences of infection, particularly if you’re vaccinated, are less marked than they were a year ago,” said Peter Collignon, an infectious disease physician and professor at the Australian National University Medical School in Canberra.While China has seen severe disease among elderly patients with underlying medical conditions, the country hasn’t reported a single death related to Covid for nearly 10 months. With more than 75% of the population fully vaccinated, most patients experience only mild symptoms. The country has reported at least a dozen asymptomatic infections every day for the past week. Many of the stealthy infections were found only after authorities were alerted to the potential for community transmission following a case that emerged during routine testing of workers and residents. In some extreme cases, close contacts tested positive after they emerged from prolonged quarantine periods.“The reality is that it’s more difficult to control now,” Collignon said. “But equally, the consequences -- providing you get high levels of vaccination -- are much, much less than they were a year ago.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-covid-zero-turns-more-elusive-as-symptom-free-cases-grow-101636441777841.html

The clinic building is attached to the faculty of medicine.Shockingly, the well water was flowing to 120 faucets, which were used for drinking water, washing hands and even gargling. The fault happened because of an error in connecting pipes when the hospital was constructed in 1993.The report in Japanese media outlet said that no one flagged or even noticed the issue until the hospital management started construction of a new treatment plant. The problem of unsafe water was discovered during an inspection of the new building.The university is investigating the matter; it said that though the water quality is being checked, no health hazard has been confirmed.The records are available since 2014 about the water being inspected for colour, taste and odour every week. There has been, however, no issues since then.Nakatani issued an apology at a press conference recently for causing anxiety. "I am very sorry that the university hospital that provides advanced medical care has caused anxiety," he was quoted as saying by the publication.Yomiuri Shimbun reported that there are more than 100 other buildings in the campus that use the simply treated well water. The hospital authorities said they will check the piping and get the error rectified, according to the publication.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-hospital-used-water-meant-for-toilet-as-drinking-water-for-30-yrs-report-101636441719888.html

The latest violence took place on Nov 2, when gunmen stormed a military hospital in the capital, killing about 20 people including a senior Taliban commander. No claimed responsibility for the attack but the Taliban has blamed the rival group.Targeted killings of former government officials, including police and prosecutors, have also been reported. Four civil society activists and four members of the earlier Afghan police force were recently found dead in northern Mazar-e-Sharif city. Locals blamed the Taliban for their deaths.Soon after the Taliban swept into power, there were reports many armed members of the group went door-to-door to find and kill opponents or those who worked with the previous government or US forces over the past two decades. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahed would not comment on those reports but had vowed the militant group would investigate them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-carries-out-background-checks-within-ranks-to-identify-is-infiltrators-101636437097623.html

09-11-2021||World||China bares its teeth on Taiwan in US warship mock targets in Xinjiang||A month after China violated the Taiwan air defence identification zone (ADIZ) with as many as 56 fighters and nuclear bombers, the PLA has now constructed missile targets in the shape of American super carriers and destroyers in Xinjiang desert, according to a November 7 report in United States Naval Institute (USNI) News.While US President Joe Biden has publicly announced his commitment to defend Taiwan against Chinese invasion, the new mock-up targets show the seriousness of the PLA to integrate democratic Taiwan with mainland Communist China.Although the mock-up targets could be part of China's elaborate misinformation campaign, but President Xi Jinping has made it clear that China will not give up "core interest" Taiwan at any cost.The Chinese military has been practising on structures in the shape of American aircraft carriers and other warships, according to USNI News. The complex has been constructed in Taklamakan desert in Southwest Xinjiang province, the news outlet further reported based on the photos provided by satellite imagery company Maxar.Two Arleigh Burke-class destroyers are also part of the target range, according to USNI News. It is near a former target range China used to test early versions of its DF-21D (called carrier killer) and DF 26-R (also called Guam killer) ballistic missiles.It added that the new facility shows signs of a sophisticated instrumented target range.However, the targets do not have intricate details of the carrier, such as lifts and weapons sensors. The replicas of aircraft carriers also do not have the metaling, but the outline which appears in Maxar's images clearly depict the target as a naval ship.One of the recent images, taken by Maxar on October 9, shows a 75-metre-long target with extensive instrumentation.The facility also has an extensive rail system, according to USNI News.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at a daily briefing on Monday that he had no information about the images, saying, "I'm not aware of the situation you mentioned."Asked about the mock-ups, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said that the US continues to be concerned by China's "increasingly coercive behaviour" in the Indo-Pacific region.China-US ties have been quietly improving in recent months, but the two nations are sparring over Taiwan and alarm has been growing in Washington over Beijing’s nuclear arsenal. In a sign of how heated the rhetoric over Taiwan has become, Chinese state media last week had to tame online speculation over a possible war.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-bares-its-teeth-in-us-ship-targets-on-taiwan-101636434876261.html
09-11-2021||World||Canada may appoint Cameron Mackay as envoy to India||In an effort to boost relations with India through stronger economic ties, the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is looking at appointing a veteran trade expert Cameron Mackay as its high commissioner to New Delhi.He is currently Canada’s Ambassador to Indonesia, but has an established track record in trade negotiations.Mackay served as the director general of Global Affairs Canada’s Trade Negotiations Bureau, where he coordinated and supported Canada’s bilateral, regional and multilateral trade negotiations.While discussions on a free trade agreement between the two nations have been revived, Hindustan Times has learnt that Ottawa is almost certain to appoint to trade negotiator to be the country’s top diplomat in India after the post fell vacant when Nadir Patel returned to Canada in June this year after serving for over six years as high commissioner there.However, the decision on naming the new high commissioner will lie with Canada’s new foreign minister Melanie Joly, after she replaced her predecessor Marc Garneau when Justin Trudeau announced his new cabinet late last month.India and Canada took forward discussions over a trade deal to the ministerial level at the G20 Trade and Investment Ministerial Meeting in Sorrento, Italy in October, when Indian commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal met Canada’s international trade minister Mary Ng.Piyush Goyal had then tweeted that talks were on “for a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA), with energy, new technologies, manufactured goods & services, being key areas for future cooperation”.After languishing for nearly four years, Indian and Canadian negotiators resumed discussions in June towards a possible trade pact between the two countries.Those discussions, held virtually, were undertaken by officials of India’s commerce ministry and those from Canada’s international trade department. They had revisited the stalled CEPA, which has been under consideration for a full decade after talks were initiated under then Indian PM Dr Manmohan Singh and then Canadian PM Stephen Harper.The last round of negotiations was held in August 2017. While Canadian officials wanted to clinch a Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement (FIPA) prior to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s visit to India in February 2018, New Delhi was more interested in concluding CEPA first. However, with relations declining following that disastrous visit, fresh talks were not scheduled outside of routine stocktaking.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-may-appoint-cameron-mackay-as-envoy-to-india-101636434965072.html
09-11-2021||World||Eye on India: China builds, delivers biggest stealth warship to Pakistan||China on Monday delivered to Pakistan the largest and most advanced warship, a frigate with stealth capabilities, it has ever manufactured as Beijing and Islamabad continue to strengthen their military capabilities against regional rival, India.Chinese state media reported the commissioning of the warship, quoting local and Pakistani officials, listing the vessel’s advanced capabilities, and noting that the delivery highlights Sino-Pakistan “all-weather strategic cooperative partnership”.The PNS Tughril is the first of the four Type 054 frigates being constructed for the Pakistan Navy, the state-run tabloid, Global Times reported, saying that the “…ship is a technologically advanced and highly capable platform with enormous surface-to-surface, surface-to-air and underwater firepower, besides extensive surveillance potentials”.Designed and built by China State Shipbuilding Corporation Limited (CSSC), the frigate was delivered to the Pakistan Navy in a commissioning ceremony in Shanghai, the tabloid reported, quoting a CSSC statement, issued on Monday.Compared to previous Chinese frigates, the new ship has better air defence capability, as it is equipped with an improved radar system and a larger amount of missiles with a longer range, Zhang Junshe, a senior research fellow at the PLA Naval Research Academy, told the Global Times in a previous interview.Zhang said Type 054A, on which the Type 054A/P is based, is China’s most advanced frigate, adding it also has world-class stealth capability.“The completion and the delivery of the vessel is another major achievement of China-Pakistan friendship, and will further enhance the all-weather strategic cooperative partnership between the two countries,” the CSSC said.Speaking to Chinese state media earlier this year, Pakistan navy chief Admiral M Amjad Khan Niazi, had listed the warship procurement from China.“…naval collaboration between the two countries has been strengthened with the procurement of F-22P frigates, fast attack craft (missile), helicopters and state-of-the-art survey ship. The Pakistan Navy has also contracted construction of eight Hangor-class submarines, four Type 054A/P ships (one of which was delivered on Monday) and medium-altitude long-endurance unmanned combat aerial vehicles from China,” Niazi had said.“The delivery of the frigate also serves as a milestone in expanding the influence of Chinese vessels as products and boosting their competitiveness in the international market,” CSSC said.China and Pakistan have also upgraded their jointly developed JF-17 fighter jet, it emerged last year. “The development and production of the JF-17 Block 3 are under way,” Yang Wei, a Chinese legislator and chief designer of the China-Pakistan co-developed fighter jet, was quoted as saying by the state media in 2020.The JF-17, or the FC-1, is a single-engine multi-role light fighter jet jointly developed by China and Pakistan for export, according to the website of the Aviation Industry Corporation of China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eye-on-india-china-builds-delivers-biggest-stealth-warship-to-pakistan-101636432684895.html
09-11-2021||World||SpaceX capsule with 4 ISS astronauts returns to earth, ending 200-day flight||Four astronauts returned to Earth on Monday, riding home with SpaceX to end a 200-day space station mission that began last spring.Their capsule parachuted into the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Pensacola, Florida, in darkness. Recovery boats quickly moved in with spotlights.Their homecoming — coming just eight hours after leaving the International Space Station — paved the way for SpaceX's launch of their four replacements as early as Wednesday night.The newcomers were scheduled to launch first, but NASA switched the order because of bad weather and an astronaut's undisclosed medical condition. The welcoming duties will now fall to the lone American and two Russians left behind at the space station.Before Monday afternoon’s undocking, German astronaut Matthias Maurer, who’s waiting to launch at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center, tweeted it was a shame the two crews wouldn’t overlap at the space station but “we trust you’ll leave everything nice and tidy.” His will be SpaceX's fourth crew flight for NASA in just 1 1/2 years.NASA astronauts Shane Kimbrough and Megan McArthur, Japan's Akihiko Hoshide and France's Thomas Pesquet should have been back Monday morning, but high wind in the recovery zone delayed their return.“One more night with this magical view. Who could complain? I’ll miss our spaceship!” Pesquet tweeted alongside a brief video showing the space station illuminated against the blackness of space and the twinkling city lights on the nighttime side of Earth.From the space station, NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei -- midway through a one-year flight -- bid farewell to each of his departing friends, telling McArthur "I’ll miss hearing your laughter in adjacent modules.”Before leaving the neighborhood, the four took a spin around the space station, taking pictures. This was a first for SpaceX; NASA's shuttles used to do it all the time before their retirement a decade ago. The last Russian capsule fly-around was three years ago.It wasn't the most comfortable ride back. The toilet in their capsule was broken, and so the astronauts needed to rely on diapers for the eight-hour trip home. They shrugged it off late last week as just one more challenge in their mission.The first issue arose shortly after their April liftoff; Mission Control warned a piece of space junk was threatening to collide with their capsule. It turned out to be a false alarm. Then in July, thrusters on a newly arrived Russian lab inadvertently fired and sent the station into a spin. The four astronauts took shelter in their docked SpaceX capsule, ready to make a hasty departure if necessary.Among the upbeat milestones: four spacewalks to enhance the station's solar power, a movie-making visit by a Russian film crew and the first-ever space harvest of chile peppers.The next crew will also spend six months up there, welcoming back-to-back groups of tourists. A Japanese tycoon and his personal assistant will get a lift from the Russian Space Agency in December, followed by three businessmen arriving via SpaceX in February. SpaceX's first privately chartered flight, in September, bypassed the space station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spacex-capsule-with-4-iss-astronauts-returns-to-earth-ending-200-day-flight-101636429511665.html

Some, however, have continued to experience symptoms weeks or even months later.The figures are based on daily reports provided by health authorities in each country.A significant proportion of the less severe or asymptomatic cases remain undetected despite increased screening in many countries since the start of the pandemic. In addition, testing policies differ from country to country.Europe is the region with the highest number of infections, registering more than 76 million Covid-19 cases since the start of the outbreak in China in December 2019.Asia is the second most affected with 56,201,653 cases, followed by the United States and Canada (48,290,522 infections) and Latin America and the Caribbean (46,107,131).The number of new cases around the world has been slowly increasing over the past few weeks.Nearly 449,000 new daily infections have been recorded on average over the past seven days, against just over 400,000 in mid-October.Of the new infections recorded worldwide, more than 60 percent are in Europe, which has seen an average of 279,000 cases a day over the past seven days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-covid-19-tally-crosses-250-million-report-101636426537803.html

But traffic advanced steadily.In the Mexican city of Ciudad Juarez opposite El Paso, Texas, about 20 people lined up early on Monday before crossing and embracing family on the other side of the border."We thought they were going to tell us again they had decided not to open it," said Lorena Hernandez, stroking her grown-up daughter's hair and smiling broadly after they were reunited in El Paso for the first time since March 2020. "I said, 'If they don't reopen, I'm going to take a plane.'"Mexico's foreign ministry said late on Monday that the first day of the border reopening was carried out "without incident.""The border flow is expected to increase over the weekend and progressively as the holidays approach and starting with Black Friday," the ministry said.Still, differing rules over coronavirus vaccines threaten to hold up some family reunions, while the prospect of some curbs easing has also encouraged migrants to try their luck seeking US asylum, posing a new test for the Biden administration.Some inoculated Mexicans will be prevented from entering the United States immediately if they received vaccines in Mexico that have not been approved by the World Health Organization, such as China's CanSino and Russia's Sputnik V."I never imagined that because I got the CanSino vaccine I wouldn't be able to cross," lamented Donato Suarez, a driver at a private university in Tijuana who had hoped to visit relatives in the United States he has not seen for nearly two years."We even had plans to do something when the border reopened," he added, noting around 300 people where he works are in the same predicament. "We'll have to wait."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/usmexico-border-reopens-after-20-months-of-covid-shutdown-101636421626546.html

Wang and her colleague Zhai Zhigang stepped out of the module on Sunday night - waving to the camera while tethered to the outside of the station - and installed a suspension device and transfer connectors.The third member of the crew, Ye Guangfu, assisted from inside the station, China Manned Space (CMS) agency said.“This marks the first extravehicular activity of the Shenzhou-13 crew, and it is also the first in China’s space history involving the participation of a woman astronaut,” said CMS.“The whole process was smooth and successful,” the agency added.Tiangong is expected to operate for at least 10 years, and the three astronauts are the second group to stay there. Wang is the first woman to visit.Sunday’s operation came just weeks after Wang, Zhai and third team member Ye Guangfu blasted off from the Jiuquan launch centre in northwestern China’s Gobi desert. The team is expected to spend six months at the station.Soviet cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya was the first woman to walk in space in 1984.

09-11-2021||World||SpaceX crew homecoming today after 6 months aloft||A SpaceX capsule carrying four astronauts left the International Space Station bound for Earth on Monday after spending six busy months aboard the orbital outpost.Since arriving on April 24, the crew of two Americans, a Frenchman and one Japanese astronaut conducted hundreds of experiments and helped upgrade the station's solar panels.They boarded their SpaceX Dragon dubbed "Endeavour" and undocked from the ISS at 2:05 pm US Eastern Time (1905 GMT), NASA announced.Endeavour will now loop around the ISS for around an hour-and-a-half to take photographs, the first such mission since a Russian Soyuz spaceship performed a similar maneuver in 2018.The Dragon, which is flying mostly autonomously, has a small circular window at the top of its forward hatch through which the astronauts can point their cameras.Splashdown is scheduled for 10:33 pm (0333 GMT Tuesday) off the coast of Florida, marking the end of the "Crew-2" mission. NASA is running a livestream."Proud to have represented France once again in space! Next stop, the Moon?" tweeted Thomas Pesquet, representing the European Space Agency (ESA).Their activities have included documenting the planet's surface to record human-caused changes and natural events, growing Hatch chile peppers and studying worms to better understand human health changes in space.Crew-2's departure was delayed a day by high winds.Bad weather and what NASA called a "minor medical issue" have also pushed back the launch of the next set of astronauts, on the Crew-3 mission, which is now set to launch Wednesday.Until then, the ISS will be inhabited by only three astronauts -- two Russians and one American.SpaceX began providing astronauts a taxi service to the ISS in 2020, ending nine years of US reliance on Russian rockets for the journey following the end of the Space Shuttle program.Broken toiletThe crew will face a final challenge on their journey home -- they will have to wear diapers after a problem was detected with the capsule's waste management system, forcing it to remain offline.They will have no access to a toilet from the time the hatch closes at 12:40 pm (1740 GMT) until after splashdown -- around 10 hours."Of course that's sub-optimal, but we're prepared to manage," NASA astronaut Megan McArthur said at a press conference."Space flight is full of lots of little challenges, this is just one more that we'll encounter and take care of in our mission."A SpaceX all-tourist crew encountered a similar waste-related problem during a September flight, which triggered an alarm system.NASA later said a tube had come unglued, sending urine to the capsule's fan system instead of a storage tank.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spacex-crew-homecoming-today-after-6-months-aloft-101636419275368.html
09-11-2021||World||Pakistan Taliban agree to ‘complete ceasefire’||Pakistan and local Taliban militants have agreed to a “complete ceasefire”, information minister Fawad Chaudhry said on Monday, after talks which the Taliban government in neighbouring Afghanistan helped to arrange.The Pakistani Taliban aim to overthrow the government and govern the South Asian nation of 220 million by enforcing their own brand of harsh Islamic law.The militants, also known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, are separate from the Afghan Taliban.“The ceasefire will keep on extending with the progress in the negotiations,” Chaudhry said in a statement. “The government of Pakistan and banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan have agreed on a complete ceasefire.”Separately, Pakistan said on Monday it has lifted a ban on a radical Islamist party behind a violent anti-France protest last month that triggered clashes with police, leaving six officers and four demonstrators dead.The development follows an agreement reached last week between the government of Prime Minister Imran Khan and Tehreek-e-Labiak Pakistan that the party would halt its march to Islamabad. The march was called to demand the closure of the French embassy in the Pakistani capital.The interior ministry lifted the ban late on Sunday, saying the move was in the “national interest”.. In response, the party on Monday afternoon ended its two-week protest along a highway in the city of Wazirabad, telling demonstrators that TLP’s leader Saad Rizvi would soon be released from jail and urging them to return to the city of Lahore to await his release.The party has waged an anti-France campaign after Paris-based satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo republished cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed - act deemed blasphemous by many Muslims.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-taliban-agree-to-complete-ceasefire-101636419598873.html
09-11-2021||World||Pressure on countries to act as UN talks enter final week||Developing nations accused richer countries of bargaining with the lives of billions of people on the climate crisis frontline on Monday, blasting insufficient commitments as COP26 talks enter their final week with trust in short supply.Countries remain starkly divided on key issues at the UN meeting, including how rapidly the world curbs carbon emissions and how to ramp up support for countries already battered by storms, floods and drought intensified by global heating.After a week of headline announcements from host Britain on ending deforestation and phasing out coal, experts say the underlying COP26 negotiations have progressed little.Countries are in Glasgow to work out how to implement the Paris Agreement’s goals of limiting temperature rises to between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius. And while recent announcements mean they have inched closer, many disputes remain unresolved.These include pushing for more ambitious national carbon reduction plans, providing a long-promised $100 billion annually to developing nations and rules governing carbon markets.“As the group least responsible for the climate crisis, but suffering most from its impact, we came to Glasgow with high expectations,” said Sonam Phuntsho Wangdi of Bhutan, who heads the Least Developed Nations negotiating bloc.He urged “strong commitments” from delegates at the UN talks, calling for faster emissions cuts. “Any compromise on limiting temperature rise in line to 1.5C in this decade will mean negotiating the lives of billions in the most vulnerable countries like ours.”With scientists warning that countries have until the end of the decade to slash emissions almost in half, former US President Barack Obama attended the summit to tell delegates “time really is running out”. He said the Paris Agreement of 2015 had made important progress, but stressed that the deal was just the beginning.“Most nations have failed to be as ambitious as they need to be,” he said, echoing current President Joe Biden in saying it was “disturbing” that neither the leaders of China or Russia had travelled to Glasgow.Earlier, COP26 President Alok Sharma said the first week of technical negotiations had “already concluded some important issues that will drive accelerated climate action”.But he said any preliminary conference decision text - over which ministers will haggle when they arrive in Glasgow later this week - had not yet materialised. “We have a lot of work to do across all issues that remain,” said Britain’s chief negotiator Archie Young.A senior diplomatic source told AFP that there was so much yet to be agreed that draft texts as they currently stood would be “illegible” for ministers.Dozens of nations have signed up to a COP26 initiative to end their use of coal - the most polluting fossil fuel -- within decades, including major users South Korea and Vietnam.But missing from the pact were the top consumers China, India and the United States.Major exporter Australia, which also declined to join the initiative, said Monday it would continue to sell coal for “decades into the future”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pressure-on-countries-to-act-as-un-talks-enter-final-week-101636419092764.html
09-11-2021||World||Developed nations trying to renegotiate climate finance||India flagged that developed countries are trying to renegotiate who or which countries will provide resources for climate change mitigation, and how often nationally determined contributions (NDCs) will be updated, violating principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities (CBDR, under which countries take climate action as per their respective capabilities) .During an informal stock taking of negotiations by Glasgow climate change conference (COP 26) President, Alok Sharma on Monday, India’s lead negotiator, Richa Sharma on behalf of BASIC (Brazil, South Africa, India, and China) countries said these issues are already specified in the Paris Agreement and should not be renegotiated.The Paris Agreement specifies that climate finance and technology support should flow from developed to developing countries. HT reported on Sunday that there are talks of including some developing countries particularly China, Saudi Arabia, even India as donors for the post 2025 new climate finance goal. India has also flagged the erosion of trust due to developed countries’ failure to deliver the $100 billion-a-year fund.“It’s been over a decade that the $100 billion was promised and the world is still waiting which is why trust in multilateralism at stake. There should be a structured process for a new higher finance goal which is a simple ask from developing countries”, she said. If not resolved this will jeopardise net zero commitments of parties and NDCs, Sharma added. India expects credible carbon markets and not cheap offsets, she pointed out.“Trust in multilateralism and credibility of the process is at stake. Post-2020 mitigation ambition and net zero pledges require significantly enhanced climate finance...BASIC would like to warn that lack of a serious approach to climate finance will jeopardize the enhanced mitigation and adaptation ambition as well as net zero pledges of parties,” she added.India’s view is seconded by many developing countries.Bolivia’s lead negotiator, Diego Pacheco, on behalf of Like Minded Developing Countries said: “ Let’s be honest they don’t want to define finance, talk about loss and damage, new finance goal. How can finance be achieved like this? The history of broken promises and unfulfilled commitments has a strong bearing of where we are today.” According to him, the principles of equity and CBDR are non-negotiable.Developed nations are resisting demands for a new finance goal for the post 2025 period, financial compensation for loss and damage, and an independent review of the promised $100 billion-a-year financing.“The stakes could not be higher for countries, communities and peoples on the front lines of the climate crisis... This is a race that we cannot afford to lose. It’s remarkable that [after] close to 30 years of international climate negotiations, adaptation finance represents a mere 25 %of total climate finance, despite what we know and what we’re seeing and experiencing all over the world,” said Selwin Hart, Special Adviser to the UN Secretary-General on Climate Action during his address at COP26However, Frans Timmermans, executive vice-president of the European Commission in-charge of the European Green Deal during a press conference by EU at COP 26 said: “We are very serious about the delivery of the USD 100 billion. Once delivered there can be some serious discussion on the post 2025 new finance goal.”Meanwhile climate economist, Nicholas Stern said on Monday that India had made among the “most important” NDC announcements.Former US President, Barak Obama attended the talks on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/developed-nations-trying-to-renegotiate-climate-finance-101636416690348.html

Many Kaseya customers were infected at once with REvil encryption. Some paid ransoms, though a master decryption key was eventually recovered by authorities and distributed weeks later.The Treasury said more than $200 million in ransom payments were paid in Bitcoin and Monero. It added that Latvian and Estonian government agencies were vital to the investigation.Vasinskyi, 22, was being held in Poland pending U.S. extradition proceedings, while Polyanin, 28, remained at large.Up to 1,500 businesses around the world have been affected by ransomware attacks centered on Kaseya, which provides software tools to IT outsourcing shops. Such companies typically handle back-office work for companies too small or modestly resourced to have their own tech departments.The U.S. indictment of the Ukrainian hacker said he and other conspirators started deploying hacking software around April 2019 and "regularly" updated and refined it. The indictment also accused the hacker of laundering money obtained through a hacking extortion scheme.Europol said earlier on Monday that Romanian authorities on Nov. 4 arrested two individuals suspected of cyber-attacks deploying the REvil ransomware. Since February, law enforcement authorities have arrested three other affiliates of REvil, Europol added.Twelve suspects believed to have mounted ransomware attacks against companies or infrastructure in 71 countries were "targeted" in raids in Ukraine and Switzerland, Europol said on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-charges-ukrainian-russian-over-cyberattack-seizes-6-million-in-ransom-101636409407492.html
09-11-2021||World||India’s pledge among most substantive: Climate expert||India’s pledge was among the most substantive contributions at Glasgow climate change conference, Nicholas Stern, one of the world’s pre-eminent climate economists and Chair of the Grantham Research Institute at London School of Economics said on Monday during a meeting with journalists.“PM Modi’s panchamrit (nectar distilled from five ingredients; in this case, the five promises) was among the most substantive at COP26. Institutional reform will be needed to implement those which has already begun,” he said.India is focused on solar, green hydrogen and decarbonising the Railways by 2030 on all of which it will see tremendous returns, Stern explained -- but it will also need financial investments running into hundreds of billions of dollars. Some of this will come from public finance, some from external finance, and it will also come, increasingly, from companies looking for clean investment opportunities to meet their own pledges. India has to make itself an attractive destination for these companies, Stern said.He things COP26 will help to some extent. “I look at it like this: before Paris we were headed for 4 degree warming, after Paris it was 3 degree warming, after Glasgow it could be 2 degree warming.”He also thinks the ongoing summit was “unusual” because “PMs and Presidents came before the negotiations and declared their vision” an also because the “private sector is here in large numbers”. The first indicates intent and the second means companies “are looking for opportunities to invest”.And he thinks Indian PM Narendra Modi’s pledge was “among the most important”. “There has been progress on decarbonising steel sector, green hydrogen and electric vehicles in all of which India can play a major role.,” he said.Stern and Amar Bhattacharya, visiting professor in practice at Grantham Research Institute at LSE released a policy paper titled “Beyond the $100 billion: financing a sustainable and resilient future” which said developed countries’ commitment to mobilise $100 billion a year by 2020 to support developing countries on climate action is both an intensely important symbol of trust and foundational to progress on climate action by developing countries. Donors collectively fell short of the goal in 2020, but there is an opportunity to step up and deliver in 2022, it added. The paper also said that donors must double bilateral climate finance to $60 billion by 2025 from its 2018 level, and multilateral development banks (MDBs), triple their level of financing by 2025 from their 2018 levels.India will meet 50% of its energy needs from renewable energy sources and transition to net zero emissions by 2070, PM Narendra Modi said in his national statement during the World Leaders Summit last week in Glasgow.During his address to over 120 heads of countries, PM Modi said India will increase its non-fossil fuel energy capacity to 500 GW by 2030; fulfil 50% of its energy requirements from renewable energy sources by 2030; reduce its total projected carbon emissions by 1 billion tonnes between now and 2020; reduce the carbon intensity of its economy by 45% by 2030; and achieve the target of net zero emissions by 2070.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indias-pledge-among-most-substantive-climate-expert-101636406598856.html

These dignitaries include the Prime Minister of Qatar Sheikh Khalid bin Khalifa bin Abdulaziz Al Thani and the President of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan.The Dawn report said that the federal government has sent this list to the Sindh government, which approved it during a meeting of the provincial cabinet two weeks back. Prior to 2016-17, the special permits were directly granted by the federal government to Arab dignitaries, the report also said.The Qatari Prime Minister is allowed to hunt for the Houbara bustard in Jacobabad district while UAE President Al Nahyan is allowed to hunt for the bird in Sukkur, Ghotki, Sanghar, Nawabshah and Khairpur districts, it added.Other dignitaries include King of Bahrain Hammad bin Isa bin Salman Al-Khalifa, the deputy chairman of Dubai Police etc.Houbara bustard is an endangered bird species that is internationally protected. It migrates southwards every year to spend its winters in a relatively warmer environment in Pakistan. The Pakistani government specially invites Arab hunters for hunting the bird. Last year, special permits were issued to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and two other members of the royal family.However, this year, Pakistan is facing heat over the killing of a journalist who posted videos of hunting Houbara bustard by Arab dignitaries. Nazim Jokhio, a resident of Karachi, was killed on Wednesday after he posted a video, saying that he was being threatened over clips he posted on hunting trips by Arab dignitaries in Pakistan.“I am not scared. I am getting threats and will not apologise,” Jokhio said in the video.An international media watchdog has demanded an independent investigation into the journalist's killing and said that culprits must be identified and brought to justice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-allows-14-arab-dignitaries-to-hunt-for-houbara-bustard-in-sindh-101636386945707.html
09-11-2021||World||US warns of winter hurdles for Afghans to leave||Afghanistan's harsh winter will create new difficulties for people wishing to leave with the Kabul airport still in disrepair, a US official warned Monday.Thomas West, the US pointman on Afghanistan, said that the Taliban still has largely made good on promises to let US citizens and US long-term residents leave if they so choose after the insurgents' overthrow of the Western-backed government."I think the real challenge we face," West told reporters, "is potentially logistical especially as we head into the winter months.""Many runway lights are damaged and not functioning and the airport's ability to operate in the winter months is in question," he said.West voiced hope that the Taliban would work with partners on fixing up the airport, which is primarily accommodating costly and limited charter flights.Turkey and Qatar have both previously voiced a willingness to work on the airport.The US military took over the airport in August in the last days of its 20-year war in Afghanistan, evacuating tens of thousands of foreigners and Afghans who feared the return of the Taliban.Safe passage has been a key condition for the United States as it decides whether it can work with the Taliban.West, however, said it was too early to think about reopening the US Embassy in Kabul."When it comes to reopening our embassy in Kabul, I have to tell you candidly that we are not seriously thinking about taking that step at this time," he said."I think what we want to see is the establishment of a record of responsible conduct by the Taliban, of predictable conduct."No nation has recognized the Taliban although some nations, notably the insurgents' historic ally Pakistan, have pushed for greater engagement.The United States has previously said it will also watch to see whether the Taliban distances itself from Al-Qaeda and allows education of girls, two key concerns from the militants' 1996-2001 regime which imposed a draconian interpretation of Islam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-warns-of-winter-hurdles-for-afghans-to-leave-101636390645283.html

At present, people can only book an appointment for booster shots six months after their second vaccine dose."We're starting to see too many elderly people getting into hospital. Sadly, the Covid-19 jabs do wane," Johnson said on Monday, adding that the booster is very effective against Covid-19."It's (booster) a wonderful thing. People get 95% more protection... if you've gone over five months, you can go online and book your booster," he further said.The Prime Minister is heavily relying on booster shots as a major plank of his government's plan to avoid lockdown during winters. According to news agency Reuters on Saturday, around three in five eligible people over the age of 50 have received the shots and more than nine million people have received them so far in the UK.Daily Covid-19 cases are still above the 30,000-mark and the UK accounts for almost a tenth of the new infections recorded globally.Despite vaccination leading to a massive reduction in virus-related deaths, doctors have warned that hospitals in the country are facing pressure, Reuters further reported.Over 1,000 patients are being hospitalised daily. Speaking to Reuters, Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, said last week that the National Health Service (NHS) will be overwhelmed again."Even though Covid isn't responsible for as many of the ICU places as it has been in the past, it's still around a third of them, and that's going up. I don't know how they're expecting NHS staff to cope, mentally and physically," Griffin said.(With Reuters inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/95-more-protection-uk-pm-encourages-people-to-book-covid-19-booster-shots-101636378758377.html
09-11-2021||World||Afghans sell children to survive as food crisis deepens under Taliban: Report||With each passing day, the situation in Afghanistan is worsening under the new Taliban regime which does not have funds to procure food items and other essentials.Severe lack of funds and an unprecedented surge in food prices have left scores of Afghans hungry and some people are forced to sell their children to survive, according to the Canada-based think tank International Forum for Rights and Security (IFFRAS)."There are reports that 95 per cent of Afghans do not have enough food to eat while half of the population is expected to face acute levels of hunger as winter sets in early November," IFFRAS said.More than half the population of Afghanistan - a record 22.8 million people - will face acute food insecurity from November, a UN aid organisation said on Monday.This data regarding acute hunger was revealed in a new report issued by Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) by the Food Security and Agriculture Cluster of Afghanistan, co-led by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN and the UN World Food Programme (WFP).A WFP release stated that the combined impacts of drought, conflict, Covid-19, and the economic crisis, have severely affected lives, livelihoods, and people's access to food.The report's findings come as Afghanistan's harsh winter looms, threatening to cut off areas of the country where families desperately depend on humanitarian assistance to survive the freezing winter months.The IPC report has found that more than one in two Afghans will be facing crisis or emergency levels of acute food insecurity through November 2021 to March 2022 lean season, requiring urgent humanitarian interventions to meet basic food needs, protect livelihoods and prevent a humanitarian catastrophe.The report also notes that this is the highest number of acutely food insecure people ever recorded in the ten years the UN has been conducting IPC analyses in Afghanistan. Globally, Afghanistan is home to one of the largest number of people in acute food insecurity in both absolute and relative terms"It is urgent that we act efficiently and effectively to speed up and scale up our delivery in Afghanistan before winter cuts off a large part of the country, with millions of people - including farmers, women, young children and the elderly - going hungry in the freezing winter. It is a matter of life or death. We cannot wait and see humanitarian disasters unfolding in front of us - it is unacceptable!" said QU Dongyu, FAO Director-General."Afghanistan is now among the world's worst humanitarian crises - if not the worst - and food security has all but collapsed. This winter, millions of Afghans will be forced to choose between migration and starvation unless we can step up our life-saving assistance, and unless the economy can be resuscitated. We are on a countdown to catastrophe and if we don't act now, we will have a total disaster on our hands," said David Beasley, WFP Executive Director."Hunger is rising and children are dying. We can't feed people on promises - funding commitments must turn into hard cash, and the international community must come together to address this crisis, which is fast spinning out of control," Beasley warned.The IPC report reflects a 37 per cent increase in the number of Afghans facing acute hunger since the last assessment issued in April 2021, WFP said.Among those at risk are 3.2 million children under five who are expected to suffer from acute malnutrition by the end of the year. In October, WFP and UNICEF warned that one million children were at risk of dying from severe acute malnutrition without immediate life-saving treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghans-sell-children-to-survive-as-food-crisis-deepens-under-taliban-report-101636381713035.html
09-11-2021||World||China: Xi Jinping looks to secure another term as Communist party meet begins||A summit of the Communist Party of China (CPC) elite opened behind closed doors in Beijing on Monday as President Xi Jinping looks to secure both his legacy and future as China’s leader for a third term in 2022.The detailed agenda of the four-day meeting is secret but what is known is that on Monday Xi delivered a work report on behalf of CPC Central Committee’s powerful Politburo and explained a “…draft resolution on the major achievements and historical experience of the CPC’s 100 years of endeavours”.Interestingly, at a similar plenum in 2016, a year ahead of the once-in-five-year CPC congress, the party had anointed Xi Jinping as the “core” putting him at par with Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping, two of Communist China’s iconic leaders.“Chinese people who had suffered subjugation and bullying since the advent of modern times had stood up. The Chinese nation is advancing toward modernisation on all fronts and socialism has blazed a successful trail in the world’s most populous country,” an October statement by politburo had said, giving context to the ongoing meeting.The resolution - only the third such document in CPC’s history -- document is set to look back at key events in the party’s 100-year history, “…reinforce unity among the party and strengthen the authority and leadership of the CPC central committee with Xi at its core, as well as determine the party’s direction for the next few decades”, Chinese political analysts told official media.Cutting through CPC jargon and clutter, at the end of the four-day meeting on Thursday, Xi is expected to emerge as a leader at par with Mao and Deng.“At the 6th plenum, opening today in Beijing, the Chinese Communist Party will pass its third resolution on history. But all of the verbiage in the important document to be released this week will boil down to a simple political fact: XI Jinping will lead the party for years to come,” David Bandurski, editor at the University of Hong Kong’s China Media Project wrote.“The “resolution” will be unveiled in full to the world, so that we can all pick apart its finer points - beyond, that is, Xi Jinping’s blunt claim to power,” Bandurski wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/communist-party-meet-begins-in-china-xi-jinping-looks-to-secure-another-term-101636378078687.html

Kumar is currently heading the Mumbai-based Western Naval Command. The 59-year-old officer was commissioned into the navy in January 1983.Before taking over the Western Naval Command, Kumar served as the Chief of Integrated Defence Staff to the Chairman, Chiefs of Staff Committee, the ministry said in a statement.In that capacity, Vice Admiral Kumar was involved in the ongoing theaterisation drive for optimal use of the military’s resources.The warships commanded by Kumar include aircraft carrier INS Viraat (no longer in service), INS Ranvir, INS Nishank and INS Kora, the statement said. He has undergone courses at the Naval War College, the US, Army War College, Mhow and Royal College of Defence Studies, the UK.Kumar will take over the navy’s reins when the department of military affairs (DMA), headed by the chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat, asked the three services to expedite their ongoing studies on the creation of theatre commands to best utilise the military’s resources for future wars and operations, and submit comprehensive reports within six months.The setting of an April 2022 deadline for the submission of the studies focusing on finalising the joint structures seeks to give new impetus to theaterisation, a long-awaited military reform.The deadline for submitting the reports has been advanced from September 2022 to April 2022.The current theaterisation model seeks to set up four new integrated commands for synergy in operations --- two land-centric theatres, an air defence command and a maritime theatre command.The creation of theatre commands could take up to two years.Theaterisation refers to placing specific army units, the navy and the air force under a theatre commander.Such commands are to be led by an officer from any of the three services, depending on the roles assigned to them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-names-vice-adm-hari-kumar-as-next-chief-of-navy-101636482549033.html
09-11-2021||India||Don’t have time to attend Afghanistan summit: China tells India||Beijing: China on Tuesday said it will not be able to attend the India-convened security dialogue on Afghanistan on Wednesday because of “scheduling reasons”, joining close ally Pakistan in skipping the meet.“Due to scheduling reasons, it is inconvenient for China to attend the meeting,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at the regular ministry briefing on Tuesday. Asked why China would not be attending the Delhi Regional Security Dialogue on Afghanistan, Wang said: “We have already given our reply to the Indian side.” India will host top security officials from Russia, Iran and five central Asian countries -- Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan -- for a security dialogue on Afghanistan in a bid to explore a common approach for practical cooperation in confronting increasing threats of terrorism, radicalisation, and drug trafficking following the Taliban’s takeover of Kabul in August.The security dialogue will chaired by National Security Adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval.Pakistan backed out from the meeting earlier this month.China, in coordination with Pakistan and Russia, has been maintaining close contact with the Afghan Taliban though it is yet to recognise its interim administration in Kabul. Not recognising the Taliban, however, has not stopped Beijing from frequently reaching out to them since their takeover in August. The Taliban has responded by calling China a “trustworthy friend” and assuring Beijing that it will not allow the East Turkestan Islamic Movement to fuel separatism in Xinjiang.Last month, Chinese state councillor and foreign minister, Wang Yi, held talks with acting deputy Prime Minister of Taliban’s interim administration in Afghanistan, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, in the Qatari capital of Doha.In September, a day after the Taliban announced the formation of an interim government in Kabul, China announced that it would donate 200 million yuan (US$31 million) worth of aid, including grains, winter supplies, and coronavirus vaccines to Afghanistan. Foreign minister Wang Yi announced the donation in a meeting held by video link with counterparts and senior diplomats from Pakistan, Iran, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan.“China has decided to urgently provide 200 million yuan ($30.96 million) worth of grains, winter supplies, vaccines, and medicines to Afghanistan according to the needs of the Afghan people,” according to state councilor and foreign minister Wang Yi, who was quoted bythe official news agency, Xinhua.Earlier this month, the first flight carrying 45 tonnes of Afghan pine nuts arrived at the Pudong International Airport in Shanghai from Kabul, marking the first time Afghanistan has exported goods to China since the Afghan Taliban took power in the country, state media reported.“As global air transport is still limited, China and Afghanistan had to overcome numerous difficulties and yet they managed to arrange the flights, which solved the problem of Afghan farmers and solidified bilateral trade ties,” Wang Yu, Chinese Ambassador to Afghanistan, said on Twitter. “In the coming months, tens of thousands of tons of pine nuts will be exported to China,” Wang added.Chinese state media even took part in selling the nuts online.“China’s e-commerce live streamer Li Jiaqi partnered with CCTV reporter Wang Bingbing selling out 120,000 cans of pine nuts from Afghanistan on Saturday, which are valued at more than 10 million yuan ($1.56 million), showing the country’s efforts to help the Afghan people to overcome economic difficulties,” the state-run tabloid Global Times reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-have-time-to-attend-afghanistan-summit-china-tells-india-101636481768558.html
09-11-2021||India||Gujarat: Deputy collector held for stalking, blackmailing woman govt officer||The Ahmedabad cybercrime branch on Tuesday arrested a 28-year-old deputy collector for allegedly stalking and blackmailing a woman government officer with her private photos and videos, which he had acquired when they were working together and became friends, police said. A complaint was lodged against the accused, identified as Mayank Patel, a class 1 state government officer serving as deputy collector in the Aravalli district, by the woman officer, said Deputy Commissioner of Police, Cyber Crime, Amit Vasava. Despite being married, Patel has been pressuring the victim, who is also married, to keep relations. When she refused to accept his demand, Patel started harassing and blackmailing her using her private photos and videos, the DCP said. Patel was arrested under sections section 354-D (stalking), 500 (punishment for defamation), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 509 (insulting the modesty of a woman) of the Indian Penal Code. He was also booked under the Information Technology Act for the breach of privacy and sending obscene material to the victim and her relatives, said Vasava. Patel, who became deputy collector in 2018 after clearing the competitive exam, had come in touch with the victim in 2016 when they were working in a town in the Kheda district. He was serving as a class-3 revenue officer back then. "He and the woman officer maintained friendly relations in the past and both used to visit each other's house. However, when the woman snapped relations and stopped talking with him, Patel started harassing her by calling her from different numbers for the last year. He used to threaten to commit suicide and also threatened to kill the victim," said Vasava. The accused used nine different numbers to call or message the victim. "If the victim ignored his calls, Patel used to call her husband and threaten him using foul language," said Vasava, adding that Patel had sent the victim's private photos and videos to her husband and her father-in-law. "At one point, Patel even tried to show the woman's private photos to her son. Though the victim's family tried to make him understand that what he was doing is wrong, he did not mend his ways. Patel did not even listen to his family members, who were aware of his activities. His only objective was to pressure the victim in continuing the relations," said Vasava.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gujarat-deputy-collector-held-for-stalking-blackmailing-woman-govt-officer-101636477793388.html

Unfortunately, the perception of a common man is to blame the court for delay in disposal of cases. Much is said about the courts going on vacations, comparing it with school vacations. I can say with full conviction that this public image is not correct,” said the judge.“The reasons for delay are many but are not really attributable to the courts. All I can say is, the court needs to take some steps to project this hard and good work that is being put in place by engaging an appropriate machinery. I need not say further on this, but I feel some image change would be useful,” he added.In his farewell speech, Justice Nath advised lawyers to “be sincere” to their briefs and clients, and reminded that there was “no shortcut to success”.The judge said that the Delhi High Court was a “cosmopolitan court” where success came from merit.“It doesn't matter from which part of the country you come from, which religion you follow, success in this court comes from merit, not from your background,” he said.Chief Justice D N Patel said that Justice Nath is a distinguished judge who will be remembered for his eminence and excellence.Born on November 10, 1959, Justice Nath was appointed as additional judge of the high court in April 2013 and became a permanent judge on March 18, 2015.Recently, Justice Nath had restrained various generic pharmaceutical companies from manufacturing or selling Valsartan and Sacubitril tablets, a combination to treat cardiovascular diseases, as it may amount to infringement of patent of pharma major Novartis AG.In May, he had ruled that the Delhi government has no power to indefinitely postpone the collection of annual charges and development fees by private unaided schools as it would unreasonably restrict their functioning.In January 2018, the judge had upheld an international arbitral award passed in the favour of Daiichi Sankyo, which paved the way for its enforcement against the Singh brothers who had sold their shares in Ranbaxy to Daiichi in 2008 for ₹9,576.1 crore.Before his elevation to the bench, Nath was designated as Senior Advocate by the high court in May 2006.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/public-perception-of-courts-going-on-vacation-like-schools-not-correct-high-court-judge-101636476369334.html

09-11-2021||India||HT THIS DAY: November 10, 2019 — SC rules in favour of a Ram temple in Ayodhya, right of child deity upheld||New Delhi- The Supreme Court ruled on Saturday in favour of a Ram temple on a disputed 2.77-acre plot in Ayodhya, in a move cheered by hundreds of millions of people around the country although some Muslim parties questioned the verdict and said they may seek a review of the order passed by a five judge Constitution bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) Ranjan Gogoi, who retires on November 17.The construction of the temple at the place several Hindus believe is the birth place of Ram also ticks off another item on the checklist of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Many people believe the ruling is the beginning of the end of the festering dispute, if not the end itself.The court told the Union government to setup, within three months, a trust to oversee the construction of the temple.“The faith of Hindus has been reaffirmed by the Supreme Court verdict. We had faith before the mosque. We had faith during the mosque and we had faith after the demolition of the mosque and there was continuous worship by the Hindus,” said PS Narasimha, who appeared for the child deity Ram Lalla Virajman in the title dispute. “We are grateful to the institution of judiciary for the extraordinary measures for restituting the historical belief,” he added.The All India Muslim Personal Law Board’s secretary Zafar yab Jilani, a lawyer, expressed his dissatisfaction over the verdict.“The Ayodhya verdict holds no value for us. We are dissatisfied with the verdict. It has a lot of contradictions. We will seek a review.”Zufar Faruqi, the chairman of the UP Sunni Waqf Board, struck a different note: “I, as the chairman of the UP Sunni Central Waqf Board, want to make it clear that the Board will not go in any review of the Supreme Court’s order or file any curative petition.”Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who on Wednesday, warned his ministers not to make extreme comments on the judgment, irrespective of which way it went, welcomed the court’s Ruling. “The Honourable Supreme Court has given its verdict on the Ayodhya issue. This verdict shouldn’t be seen as a win or loss for anybody. Be it Ram Bhakti or Rahim Bhakti, it is imperative that we strengthen the spirit of Rashtra-Bhakti. May peace and harmony prevail!, he tweeted.Addressing the nation later over the SC order, the Prime Minister said the verdict marked a new dawn and gave a message that even toughest issues can be resolved within the framework of the Constitution. “We should learn from this verdict that even if there is somedelay, we should remain patient. This is in everyone’s interest,” he said.An issue of faith for over a hundred years, the Ram Janmabhoomi-babri Masjid , or mandir issue, issue has been one of the two major shapers of the political landscape of the country over the past three decades. The other has been the Mandal movement, which has made Other Backward Classes a powerful political constituency. The mandir issue helped revive the BJP’S fortunes in the mid-1980s, and has found a mention in every one of the party’s manifestos since 1991. Given the sensitivity of the issue, and remembering the riots that followed the demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992, the response from most political parties was measured.Home minister Amit Shah welcomed the verdict and appealed all communities to accept the SC order, maintain peace and remain committed for “Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat”. Defence minister Rajnath Singh urged everyone to accept the verdict with equanimity and magnanimity.The Congress said it respected the verdict and was in favour of the construction of a Ram temple. “It is the responsibility of each one of us to reaffirm our tradition of mutual respect and unity among all that has defined our society through the ages,” the Congress’s chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said, quoting a resolution passed by the Congress Working Committee, the party’s highest decision-making body, at a meeting chaired by party chief Sonia Gandhi.However, there was fear among some Muslim parties that the ruling could strengthen the resolve of Hindus fighting for control of other disputed sites, including ones at Mathura and Varanasi.All India Majlis-e-ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) leader Asaduddin Owaisi said the verdict was a “victory of belief over facts”. Owaisi said he was not satisfied with the ruling and quoted a former CJI to say the top court is “indeed supreme but not infallible”. National Commission for Minorities chairperson Ghayorul Hasan Rizvi, however, said that Muslims were happy with the order and condemned remarks made by Jilani on considering a review plea.The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ideological parent of the BJP, and also of most groups that actively worked for a temple at Ayodhya, said the dispute over the issue must be forgotten. “Forgetting all the things that happened in past, we all should come together to build a grand temple at Ram Janma Bhoomi in Ayodhya,” RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat said. “The decision should not be taken as victory or defeat,” he added.“We believe that the government should take steps to end the dispute in the case after the SC decision.”Several Hindus believe that a temple to Ram once stood at the disputed site. In the 16th century, one of the generals of Babur, the founder of the Mughal dynasty, built a mosque at the spot. An Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) report referenced by the court points to the existence of a Hindu structure below where the mosque stood (before its demolition in 1992), but the court added that it hasn’t been able to show that this structure was a temple, or that it was demolished to build the mosque.The court’s ruling comes 136 years after the first case in the Ram Janmabhoomi-babri Masjid issue was filed, and nine years after the Allahabad high court delivered a judgment that each of the three main parties, the Sunni Waqf Board, the Nirmohi Akhara and Ram Lalla Virajman get an equal portion of the disputed land measuring 2.27 acres. The court based its decision largely on the title claims to the disputed land, choosing to look beyond the ASI report on the matter, but sticking to its previously stated intent of viewing a case that the parties and much of India saw as a faithbased one through the strict legal lens of ownership and possession. As such, it found Ram Lalla Virajman (the personification of the Hindu god), whom it identified as a juristic person, and who is represented by Trilok Nath Pandey, as having a better claim to the title than the Sunni Waqf Board. The latter, it said, can’t exercise the right of “adverse possession” nor establish a “possessory title”.Under the first, a person who is not the original owner of a property becomes the de facto owner by being in possession of it for at least 12 years during which the original owner did not seek legal recourse, and can, if dispossessed by the original owner, file a case seeing restoration of ownership under the right of adverse possession. The court held that this did not apply in the case because the Muslim parties never really lost possession. The second refers to the ownership of land or property by someone who does not hold a title deed or document that proves ownership – specifically because these documents do not exist, having been lost or destroyed. In this case, the court held that the Muslim parties were not able to establish a possessory title. The Hindus, the court found, had “unimpeded access” to the outer courtyard and, till 1857, even the inner courtyard.“Hindu worship at Ramchabutra, Sita Rasoi and at other religious places including the setting up of a Bhandar clearly indicated their open, exclusive and unimpeded possession of the outer courtyard. The Muslims have not been in possession of the outer courtyard. On a preponderance of probabilities, there is no evidence to establish that the Muslims abandoned the mosque or ceased to perform namaz in spite of the contestation over their possession of the inner courtyard after 1858,” the SC order said.The court also seems to have gone by its understanding that namaz was not offered in the structure before 1857 or after 1949 on the basis of documentary and oral evidence. In contrast, similar evidence points to continuous worship by the Hindus, it added. However, its judgment did highlight the fact that both in 1949, when locks were broken and idols installed in the structure, and 1992, when the Babri Masjid was demolished, the Muslims were at the receiving end. To remit the wrong committed – to paraphase the court – the judgment said five acres of land must be given to the Sunni Waqf Board for a mosque, elsewhere in Ayodhya.“We welcome and humbly accept the verdict of the Supreme Court,” the UP Sunni Waqf Board chairman said. Speaking about the decision on the five acres of land, AIMIM’S Owaisi said: “We have full faith in the Constitution, we were fighting for our right, we don’t need five-acre land as donation. We should reject this fiveacre land offer. Don’t patronise us.”Leaders linked to the Hindu parties welcomed the apex court’s order for an alternative land to the Muslim parties in the case. Ram Lalla deity lawyer CS Vaidyanathan told news agency ANI: “It is a great day for India. The Supreme Court has pronounced a verdict that has balanced the interest of all parties and also tried to ensure that unity and integrity of the nation are preserved and brotherhood is maintained.” The court also directed that “in the scheme to be framed by the Central Government, appropriate representation may be given in the Trust or body to the Nirmohi Akhara in such manner as the Central Government deems fit”, even though it rejected the claim of the Nirmohi Akhara of being a ‘shebait’ (a devotee who serves the deity).The Ram Janmabhoomi is not a juristic person, the SC held.Mahant Dhinendra Das, head of the Nirmohi Akhara, said: “All members of the Nirmohi Akhara will meet and take a collective decision. Only after this meeting we will be able to say anything on the issue.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htthisday-november-10-2019-sc-rules-in-favour-of-a-ram-temple-in-ayodhya-right-of-child-deity-upheld-101636471513783.html

Medical officer Dr Vishakha Shinde, and staff nurses Sapna Pathare, Asma Shaikh and Channa Anant were arrested under sections 304 and 304A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), said Manoj Patil, Superintendent of Police, Ahmednagar rural police.Quoting Ahmednagar police, HT earlier reported that 70% of deaths were caused by smoke from the fire while the remaining died after directly getting caught in the blaze that broke out in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the Civil Hospital. Most of them were senior citizens undergoing treatment for coronavirus disease (Covid-19). In connection with the incident, an FIR was registered against unidentified persons under Section 304(A) of the IPC.The fire broke out last Saturday at 11am on the ground floor of the hospital, where 17 patients were admitted, of which 15 were on either ventilator or oxygen support. While 10 patients died in the blaze at the spot, one person later succumbed to injuries.After the incident, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray ordered an inquiry and sought a detailed report on the matter. Thackeray’s office said in a statement that the chief minister spoke to the district guardian minister Hasan Mushrif and chief secretary Sitaram Kunte as soon as he came to know about the incident, asking them to ensure medical attention to those in need.“CM Thackeray has expressed condolences and ordered a detailed probe and action against those responsible for negligence,” the chief minister's office stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahmednagar-hospital-fire-medical-officer-3-nurses-arrested-on-negligence-charges-101636469966585.html

The order was subsequently revoked as chief minister Pinrayi Vijayan was not in the know of the development until Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin thanked him for granting permission. The letter also shows that Tamil Nadu sought the removal of 23 trees to widen the base of the existing Baby Dam and earthen bund to strengthen the structure at Mullaperiyar Dam. But permission was granted to clear 15 trees within an approximate area of 40 cents falling within the leased area of Tamil Nadu at the Mullaperiyar Dam site. Kerala’s four-page letter dated November 6 lists the species of trees that can be felled. The order came from the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife) Bennichan Thomas of Kerala, permitting the Executive Engineer of Water Resources Department, Cumbum, Tamil Nadu, “As per Clause 5 of the Principal Deed, the Lessee, Tamil Nadu is permitted to fell the trees, underwoods and saplings within the leased areas for the maintenance works.” A copy of the order was submitted to the Additional Chief Secretary, Water Resources Department and Principal Secretary, Forests and Wildlife Department, Kerala.That such an order was granted came to the knowledge of Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan after Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin wrote to him on November 6 thanking him for granting the long-pending request. Stalin in his letter said that he was informed by officers of the state’s Water Resources Department officers. The Kerala assembly on Monday witnessed a protest against the CPI (M)-led government’s decision to allow Tamil Nadu to fell trees, the order was later revoked. The Congress-led opposition sought a response from Vijayan and a judicial inquiry into the ‘flip-flop’.Meanwhile, in Tamil Nadu, the ruling DMK is also facing the heat from opposition parties AIADMK and BJP over matters related to the Mullaperiyar dam which is located in Kerala but comes under the control of the Tamil Nadu government. The NDA alliance partners on Monday led a protest in Tamil Nadu’s Theni district and criticised the DMK government for giving up on the state’s rights over issues related to the water storage and release in the dam. State BJP chief K Annamalai accused the DMK government of not following the due procedure while opening the dam due to the heavy rains and landslides in Kerala last month. “Theni and Idukki collectors have to be present there (while opening the dam). Why were they not present?” Annamalai asked reporters. Annamalai also questioned Stalin’s silence over the controversy on the revoked order to fell trees. On Monday night, water resources department minister S Duraimurugan responded that the dam was opened in the presence of officers of his department by following norms of the Rule Curve approved by the Central Water Commission (CWC). In a statement, Duraimurugan said that as per the Standard Operating Procedure, advance information has to be given to the officers of Kerala before opening the dam. Accordingly, Kerala officers were informed on October 27 at 6 pm that the spillway gates would be opened on October 29 at 7.29 am. “At that time, the minister and officers of Kerala were also present,” Duraimurugan said. “Thus, the decision to open the gates were made by WRD (water resources department), TN, and opened by the officers of Tamil Nadu, who are regulating the dam.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mullaperiyar-dam-tn-releases-kerala-s-order-to-fell-15-trees-which-was-later-revoked-101636465448589.html

Besides, 96 countries had recognised the vaccines which reflected India’s inoculation process, Mandaviya said.On November 3, the technical advisory team of the world health body recommended Bharat Biotech-made Covaxin for EUL for 18 years and above.“Reflecting worldwide acceptance of India’s vaccines and our vaccination process, 96 countries have agreed to Mutual Acceptance of Vaccination Certificates,” the minister was quoted as saying by news agency ANI, adding the list can be checked via CoWIN aap.In a statement, he said the government was continuing its communication with the rest of the nations so that beneficiaries of the world's largest Covid-19 vaccination programme were accepted and recognised, thereby easing travel for education, business and tourism purposes.Among the 96 countries that have so far recognised Indian vaccines are the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, Belgium, Ireland, Netherlands, Spain, Bangladesh, Russia, Kuwait, Oman, United Arab Emirates, Maldives and Brazil. Mandaviya further said over 109 crore doses of vaccines against the deadly virus had been administered so far in the country. “Under 'Har ghar dastak', healthcare workers are going to all houses to carry out the vaccination drive,” he added.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-two-of-eight-who-approved-vaccines-from-india-says-mandaviya-101636458244777.html

It added the siphoning was carried out through an elaborate and complex web of transactions by way of routing of public funds in the garb of unsecured loans given by BEL to its associate companies. The proceeds from the crime were allegedly utilised for acquiring immovable properties. “The elaborate and complex web of transactions was structured to project these assets as untainted,” the ED said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/probe-against-bsl-and-bel-ed-provisionally-attaches-assets-worth-6138cr-101636458248614.html
09-11-2021||India||Don’t expect easy prices post-Diwali, analysts say||During the Diwali shopping blitz, consumers may have splurged on account of pent-up demand but they paid higher prices due to shortages of common goods. Now the potential of inflation rising remains strong, analysts say as supply-side constraints fanning across the global economy exacerbate domestic shortages.Indians spent a staggering ₹1.25 lakh crore on consumer goods during Diwali, according to the Confederation of All India Traders. But they faced a shortage of home appliances and electronics, which were priced higher by up to 12% compared to a year ago, according to data from the Consumer Electronics and Appliances Manufacturers Association.A shortage of semiconductors, or the ubiquitous chip, has crippled the production of a range of goods--from cars, appliances, and mobile phones to television sets.Chipmakers are struggling to make enough of the vital component and there are no quick fixes, analysts say. That could mean Indian factories and consumers are buckling up for higher costs, already evident during Diwali.“Post-Diwali stocks are low and even during Diwali, stocks were not enough,” said Nilesh Gupta of electronics retailer Vijay Sales. The supply of high-end mobile phones, including the iPhone, was especially low, he said.India is also anticipating lower output of some primary food commodities, such as onion and tomatoes due to crop damage from extreme rainfall this summer.Also Read| Inflation may fall below 8 pc: RangarajanThe government has succeeded in fending off a surge in prices of onion, a volatile staple, by intervening in markets. Rains in recent months have damaged 15% of the country’s onion harvest, prompting the food ministry to release onions from a state-held stockpile beginning October, when prices rose.The government has offloaded 1,11,376 tonnes of onions between October 10 and November 2 which cooled prices, for now, the latest official data show.The government had a record reserve of 200,000 tonnes of onion to douse any inflation in the food item during the current lean season, which can impact the wider economy and households alike.Edible oil prices remain elevated despite the government’s deep cuts to import tariffs and virtual abolishing of basic custom duties. India imports up to two-thirds of its edible oil demand. Average mustard oil prices were up 42% than a year ago on November 6.However, the real upside risk to inflation lies in “imported inflation” due to the global supply-chain crisis, Ashok Agrawal, an analyst with Comtrade, a commodities trading firm, said.The takeaway from the pandemic has been that as vaccination rates have gone up and economies opened, supplies could not keep up with demand.The government has sought to halt the fuel price spiral by cutting excise duty on petrol by ₹5 and on diesel by ₹10. “However, a lot of manufacturers have already worked in higher fuel and transportation costs and prices are sticky,” Agrawal said. Even so, a further rise in crude oil, India’s highest-value import item, remains an inflation risk.Inflation has been falling in recent months, but average price rise during and following the peak pandemic has been higher and more broad-based than in previous years, according to the Reserve Bank’s data.Three components of inflation — food, fuel, and core inflation ie price in all items minus food and fuel — have moved divergently. Food inflation fell significantly from above 5% at the start of the current financial year to 0.7% in September. During the same period, fuel inflation rose from 8% to 13.6%. Core inflation, which doesn’t include volatile items such as food and fuel, remained sticky near 6%.“When compared to developed economies, inflation in Asia has remained relatively benign so far -- is this about to change?” wrote Sonal Varma, an analyst with Nomura in a November 5 Asia research note.According to Nomura, broad-based price rise across coal, gas, and oil prices will have the largest impact on countries with limited fiscal subsidies and higher shares of energy and transport in the consumer price index basket such as India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-expect-easy-prices-post-diwali-analysts-say-101636458247022.html

09-11-2021||India||Protests in Delhi, Lucknow if concerns over voters list revision not addressed: Akhilesh||Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav on Tuesday said 2.1 million new names have been added and over 1.6 million removed from voters lists ahead of the 2022 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh without allowing political parties to cross-check the additions and deletions. He warned of sit-in protests in Delhi and Lucknow if their concerns over the matter were not addressed.Yadav said the Election Commission of India (ECI) has not given the lists to the political parties to cross-check unlike until before the 2019 national elections. “ECI then gave lists to the political parties, then why not this time?” he asked at a press conference called on the fifth anniversary of the demonetisation of high-value currency notes in 2016.Yadav said SP’s state president Naresh Uttam Patel led a party delegation that met Uttar Pradesh’s chief election officer and gave him a memorandum over the matter. “We will give a memorandum in Delhi (to ECI) also and if needed sit on sit-ins.” He added he understands most of the officers posted in ECI were sent from Uttar Pradesh.Yadav earlier celebrated the birthday of Khajanchi, who was born shortly after his mother queued up in Kanpur Dehat to get her demonetised currency notes exchanged on December 2, 2016, before starting the press conference.SP has been celebrating Khajanchi’s birthday since the first anniversary of demonetisation. Khajanchi is often referred to as a demonetisation baby and he was named Khajanchi (treasurer) by the manager of the bank outside which he was born.Yadav said the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) should celebrate Khajanchi’s birthday. “Demonetisation was their gift to people to ruin the economy and businesses. The BJP has not been talking about the benefits of demonetisation. Black money did not end, corruption rose, and corruption in Uttar Pradesh rose unprecedentedly. The BJP was telling people through TV channels that the new currency had chips to check black money. Demonetisation did not end black money. Money is not black or white; it is the transactions that you or I do that are black or white. The demonetisation was done deliberately to trouble people.”Yadav blamed the BJP for the“ruin” in the economy. He called the demonetisation a “masterstroke” that turned out to be “brain stroke”. Yadav added the way it was implemented, ruined traders and businesses. He also displayed an empty cylinder at the press conference citing high fuel prices.Also Watch | ‘Ram not Dashrath’s son’: Owaisi reacts to BJP ally Nishad’s controversial claimHe referred to the Supreme Court’s observation on Monday that the investigation into the Lakhimpur Kheri violence appears to be favouring the “main accused” in the case. “The SP has been saying since the beginning that till the BJP is in power, forget about justice in the Lakhimpur Kheri case. BJP’s triple engine government will not let justice happen. Triple engine--the BJP government in the state, the BJP government at the Centre, and the BJP government of (Union minister Ajay Mishra Teni) who has not resigned even till now.”A convoy, in which at least one vehicle belonged to Teni, ran over farmers protesting three controversial laws and triggered the violence. Ashish Mishra, the son of the minister, is one of the accused in the violence.Yadav said the Special Investigation Team probing the violence will do what the state government will tell it to do. “There will be a change in 2022 and justice will be done.”Yadav also launched Samajwadi Itra (perfume). The perfume bottles and boxes are red and green (SP colours) while the cartons also have a picture of Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/protests-in-delhi-lucknow-if-concerns-over-voters-list-revision-not-addressed-akhilesh-101636457107016.html
09-11-2021||India||Activists, Opposition seek extension of free ration scheme under PMGKAY||The Right to Food Campaign and some opposition leaders have appealed to the Union government seeking extension of the free food distribution scheme under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojna (PMGKAY) which is set to be terminated on November 30.“The Right to Food Campaign immediately demands: Extension of the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (for at least six months till May 2022), with the provision of edible oil and pulses to each household,” a letter by the campaign, written to the food and public distribution minister Piyush Goyal, said.The Right to Food Campaign claims to be an informal network of individuals and organisations that is “committed to the realisation of the right to food in India”.It also demanded that the public distribution system is made universal to support all persons (except income taxpayers), especially migrants workers, homeless, sex workers, trans people and all vulnerable communities even without ration cards. The network also demanded that millets and other nutritious commodities such as pulses and oil are added to the PDS.This letter came after food secretary Sudhanshu Pandey’s November 5 announcement that there was no proposal to extend the free ration scheme launched for the underprivileged during the coronavirus pandemic beyond November 30. Pandey rationalised the Centre’s decision by saying the economy was reviving and the disposal of food grains in the open market under the Open Market Sale Scheme was positive.Opposition leaders such as Congress’ Rajya Sabha MP (member of parliament) Ripun Bora and Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Sougata Roy have also sought the continuation of the scheme. “…urging our PM to not discontinue PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana as is provided relief to several thousands of poor households,” Bora said, posting his letter to the Prime Minister on Twitter .Prime Minister Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMKGAY) was announced in March last year to ameliorate distress caused by Covid-19. Initially, the scheme was launched for the April-June 2020 period but was extended till November 30, 2021.Also Read: BJP accuses previous Congress-led govt of irregularities in Rafale jets dealUnder the PMGKAY, the government claims to have provided 5 kg free wheat/rice per month along with 1 kg free whole Chana to each member of underprivileged families per month, totalling more than 80 crore people. Families belonging to the Below Poverty Line - Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) and Priority Households (PHH) categories were eligible for the scheme.When contacted, DJ Narain, spokesperson to the minister said, "Ration worth ₹1.8 lakh crore has been distributed during the last 18 months approximately. There is going to be no shortage of subsidised and almost free ration [for] all the poor and other beneficiaries.”He said “speculation” about ration availability should be avoided. “National Food Security Act (NFSA) was always there and shall be there. Politics may be avoided on matters concerning the same,’’ he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/extension-of-free-ration-scheme-sought-from-union-government-101636455366647.html

Speaking at the 'Services Export Promotion Council - Global Services Conclave 2021” in New Delhi, the Union minister of commerce and industry said that the services sector is a key driver of India’s economic growth since not only does it provide employment to nearly 2.6 crore people, it also contributes approximately 40% to India’s total global exports.The theme of the conclave was 'India Serves: Exploring Potential Growth Sectors Beyond IT/ITes'.Goyal said that the trade surplus in the services sector was $89 billion in the financial year 2020-21 and it has been the largest FDI recipient.The minister also lauded India’s commitment to enabling ‘work from home’ during the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, saying the services sector showed “immense resilience”, especially when it remained depressed in other countries. Earlier this year, the labour ministry formalised work from home and prepared separate model standing orders for the first time for the services sector."Sectors like tourism, hospitality, etc. which suffered due to Covid-19, showing revival signs" he added.Emphasising India’s potential to become the top services exporter globally, he added that the services sector is boosting the country’s transition from an “Assembly economy” to a “Knowledge-based economy”.

Chamre had earlier taken cover in a box when the firing began.Namdev Meher, Chamre’s father-in-law who was also on the boat, said they speeded up fearing they will be taken as prisoners but soon realised the trawler’s diesel nozzle had broken. He added Chamre, who was hiding inside an empty fish box to escape the firing, was forced to come out to fix the leak as the boat was not picking speed. “Shridhar and I crawled to the engine room...diesel was leaking and hence the speed was reduced. We had no spare nozzle but were using an empty plastic bottle to plug the leak. Somehow the leak stopped temporarily and just then Dilip (the other fisherman) was wounded...”Meher said that two speedboats were chasing them. He added they started to cry and left to God their fate but Dilip continued to steer the boat and after 40 minutes or so, the speedboats gave up the chase. “Then I saw Shridhar lying motionless and I thought he may have become unconscious due to the shock...soon blood started to ooze from his nose and I was shocked to find bullet wounds on his back...a bullet also was visible near the chest and soon I realised that Shridhar was no more.”Meher said they somehow reached the Okha coast around 3am on Sunday. “I also heard that the Pakistan Navy seized a boat from Porbander and abducted six labourers on board...”Also Read |Deplorable: India protests killing of fisherman by Pak Maritime Security AgencyMeher said they along with six labourers left Vanakbarain in Diu on October 26 for a 10-day fishing trip. He added on Saturday, Chamre called his wife Jyoti and also spoke to his daughters. “At around 4pm, we were retrieving nets and finding the catch for the day when suddenly a speed boat came towards us at full speed... and started to fire. At first, we thought firecrackers were being burst due to Diwali but soon we saw a bullet piercing the 200-litre water drum and then we realised that Pakistan Navy personnel were firing at us.” Meher said their trawler was hit with a few bullets.Chamre was cremated at his native Vadrai in Maharashtra’s Palgarh district on Tuesday after Meher brought the fisherman’s body from Gujarat.Maharashtra Machimaar Kriti Samiti vice president Manendra Arekar, who attended the funeral, said Chamre’s father, Ramesh, lit the pyre in presence of his widow, Jyoti, who fainted.Rajendra Gavit, the Member of Parliament from Palghar, gave a ₹50,000 cheque as immediate relief to Chamre’s family. He said they will take up the issue of maximum compensation with the state as well as central governments. “I will also raise the issue during the winter session of Parliament...for a permanent solution to stop such firing on Indian fishermen at high seas... the fishermen were inside the Indian territorial waters..” He said authorities have taken the GPS device from the boat to find their exact location at the time of the firing.India on Monday summoned a senior Pakistani diplomat to protest the Chamre’s killing.India and Pakistan detain hundreds of fishermen each year on charges of violating the maritime boundary.

09-11-2021||India||Comedian Nalin Yadav claims he was treated like ‘criminal’ by police||Comedian Nalin Yadav has alleged that he was frisked like he was a “hardcore criminal” by Indore police on Saturday night and was also warned not to step out of his house in the night. The police, however, said it was part of “routine” checking in wake of robberies in the area, and that Yadav has been asked to file a complaint in the matter.Yadav, who was accused of hurting religious sentiments in January this year along with comedian Munawar Faruqui during a performance in an Indore restaurant, was going to a nearby eatery to get some good when the incident occurred. Apart from being frisked, he was asked to put his hands in the air and to show ownership documents of his two-wheeler. Yadav claimed this was not the only harassment; and that he was targeted several times by saffron activists, local goons and even educated people in the last nine months. He said he did not file any complaints because he cannot fight many cases in the court. “Not only this, I receive threatening and abusive calls on my social media almost daily. Recently, I posted something about Tripura violence and local people threatened me over the phone. They said I was an anti-Hindu and a sympathiser of only one community. I have to change my thinking otherwise I won’t be able to survive, I was told. Similarly, a few days ago I was harassed at a bar,” Yadav said. Pithampur Sector 1 town inspector Lokesh Bhadouriya refuted the allegations, and said, “Due to a rise in robberies in the area, we have strengthened our checking after midnight. Police personnel checked him thoroughly to rule out the possibility of him being a thief. What is wrong with it? If the person has any problem, he can come to me to file a complaint but I haven’t received any complaint.” Yadav said his earning had shrunk since the Indore incident in January and his attempts to overcome depression and serve his passion for comedy was being blocked by people, not allowing him to live normally. “Two months ago, I saw a ray of hope when my show was finalised in Chandigarh, but at the last moment, the organiser dropped me and roped in two other comedians. Similarly, I got a contract for at least five shows in Indore but all were cancelled without any reason,” said Yadav. Also Read | Munawar Faruqui case: Co-accused comedian takes to working as labourer to make ends meetYadav says he has been working in a bags manufacturing unit as a daily wager to earn a living and visits New Delhi occasionally to perform for free in cafes to maintain his connection with the audience. “A few months ago, I had lost all the hope but after media highlighted my plight, I received many calls and a new hope emerged. I am fighting hard but I don’t know for how long can I fight,” he said. “Will they ever allow me to live a normal life? Even a murderer, who is out on bail has a right to live with freedom but I don’t have it because I am carrying a stigma imposed by saffron activists of being an anti-Hindu,” Yadav added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/comedian-nalin-yadav-claims-he-was-treated-like-criminal-by-police-101636444265801.html

09-11-2021||India||‘One Health approach all about coordinating, communicating, collaborating’||As the government is working towards creating One Health platform for knowledge sharing on human and animal health, Atul Chaturvedi, the secretary of the department of animal husbandry, spoke to Anonna Dutt about it. Edited excerpts:What is the digital platform for the livestock sector about and how will it help in predicting or maintaining surveillance on outbreaks of zoonotic diseases?The department has been working with the support of the office of the principal scientific adviser to the government of India to develop an end-to-end digital platform that aims to create unique identification numbers for animals and their registration. This will help in collecting real-time data on various aspects of livestock including disease and active surveillance. The digital platform tries to address information gaps at multiple levels in livestock production. The platform also enables monitoring disease prevalence in specific geographies, the kind of remedy, and services provided for identifying and mitigating the diseases. Additionally, the digital data captured ensures better data recording, accountability and allows for better data analysis. This data will aid policy in the generation of informed policy decisions.How will surveillance data on diseases that may jump to humans be shared between departments?In the animal sector, we have a nationwide surveillance programme being steered by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, National Institute of Veterinary Epidemiology and Disease Informatics (NIVEDI), for animal infectious diseases, which also include zoonotic diseases like anthrax and brucellosis. This surveillance data are available on NIVEDI’s website.With respect to data sharing, it is still scanty. Data sharing systems with built-in mechanisms for credit sharing need to be streamlined for easy access to data by various sectors.The One Health Framework follows a multi-stakeholder approach bringing together stakeholders and institutions from both the public as well as the private sector to address the communication gap. It engages with human health and animal health professionals along with other related stakeholders working across animal, human, and environmental health sectors to improve the health of people and animals, including pets, farm animals, and wildlife. The implementation of the new One Health India programme has incorporated adequate elements to ensure complementarity and resolve the communication gaps between human health (medical practitioners) and animal health (veterinarians) professionals, especially in the area of zoonoses, antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and food safety. One Health approach is all about coordinating, communicating, and collaborating among various stakeholders.Additionally, the Covid-19 pandemic saw veterinary and medical professionals working together as many laboratories working on animal disease diagnosis actively engaged themselves in the testing of human samples. Veterinarians posted in the field played a very important role in the management of the Covid working together with medical professionals.Also Read: Peak power deficit in India almost wiped out, says power ministryHow will antibiotic resistance be addressed under the programme?As part of the One Health Initiative, we are looking at building good production practices – referred to as Good Animal Husbandry Practices – at farm and field level to reduce disease burden and hence anti-microbial resistance. To reduce the incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases, we will be organising vaccination drives in critical areas.Vaccination plays an important role in reducing disease and, hence reducing antimicrobial resistance. Under the National Animal Disease Control Programme, animals are vaccinated for FMD and Brucellosis besides other nationwide programmes on PPR and CSF in small ruminants and pigs respectively. As anti-microbial resistance is relevant in several sectors and industries, we are building and initiating awareness programmes to reach the different stakeholders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/one-health-approach-all-about-coordinating-communicating-collaborating-101636435625143.html

09-11-2021||India||UK to recognise Covaxin for inbound travel from November 22||The UK will recognise India’s Covaxin jab as an approved Covid-19 vaccine for inbound travel from November 22, a move that is expected to benefit thousands of travellers from India.Britain on Monday announced that it is adding Covaxin and China’s Sinovac and Sinopharm Beijing vaccines to its list of approved vaccines following their “emergency-use listing” by the World Health Organization (WHO). Around one billion doses of these three Covid-19 vaccines have been delivered worldwide. The WHO issued an emergency-use listing for Covaxin, developed by Bharat Biotech, on November 3 and added the jab to a growing portfolio of vaccines validated by the health body for preventing Covid-19. The listing followed an assessment of the quality, safety and efficacy of the vaccine and allows countries to expedite their own regulatory approval for the jab. The UK began recognising Covishield, the Indian version of the AstraZeneca vaccine, for inbound travel from October 4. Britain also began accepting India’s vaccine certificates from October 11, ending a travel row that had resulted in UK nationals facing mandatory 10-day quarantine on arrival even if they were fully vaccinated. Covishield and Covaxin are the two main vaccines being used for India’s immunisation programme. British high commissioner Alex Ellis tweeted that the new announcement was part of “more good news” for travellers from India to the UK. “From November 22, travellers fully vaccinated with a #COVID19 vaccine recognised by @WHO for Emergency Use Listing, including Covaxin, will not have to self-isolate; so joining those fully vaccinated with Covishield,” he said. In a statement issued on Monday night, the UK government said, “From 4am on Monday, November 22, the government will recognise vaccines on the World Health Organization’s Emergency-Use Listing (WHO EUL).” The statement said, “As a result, Sinovac, Sinopharm Beijing and Covaxin will be added to our list of approved vaccines for inbound travel, benefitting more fully vaccinated people from countries such as the UAE, Malaysia and India.” The UK said passengers who are fully vaccinated and have received their vaccine certificate from one of more than 135 approved countries and territories will no longer be required to take a pre-departure test, another test on the eighth day after their arrival, or self-isolate upon arrival.  “Instead, passengers will just need to pay for a lateral flow test to take before the end of their second day, post-arrival,” the statement said. The UK also further simplified travel rules for all inbound travellers under 18 years, who will now be treated as fully vaccinated at the border and exempt from self-isolation requirements on arrival, day eight testing and pre-departure testing. “They will only be required to take one post-arrival test and a confirmatory free PCR test if they test positive,” the statement said. Britain’s transport secretary Grant Shapps said, “As we continue to recover from the pandemic and expand our recognition of international vaccines, today’s (Monday’s) announcements mark the next step in our restart of international travel.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-vaccine-uk-to-recognise-covaxin-for-inbound-travel-from-november-22-101636434545073.html

Here’s what they say||After the Centre last week slashed excise duty on petrol and diesel by ₹5 and ₹10, respectively, all Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled states also cut value-added tax (VAT) on fuels. Odisha and Punjab also decided to reduce VAT on fuels, with the latter becoming the only Congress-ruled state to bring down fuel prices.Asked about the need to cut VAT in other Congress-ruled states, party spokesperson Pawan Khera said it’s being considered.“Look at the BJP… for the last two years, they have been saying that [the issue of rising] prices of petrol and diesel have nothing to do with the government. But when they lose a by-election, suddenly the government realises that it can reduce the excise duty on petrol and diesel,” Khera said.Also Read: Contextualising the debate on central and state taxes on petrol and dieselBJP spokesperson Gopal Krishna Agarwal reiterated the party’s position, saying that BJP-ruled states have asked the Congress to “walk the talk” and reduce VAT in the remaining two Congress-ruled states - Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh. Here is a list of 10 states that are yet to announce a reduction in VAT on auto fuels:1. Andhra Pradesh The state government led by YS Jagan Mohan Reddy ruled out cutting VAT on petrol and diesel last Sunday and even published advertisements in newspapers clarifying its stand on the issue. The state government said the Centre did not adequately compensate it despite collecting ₹3.35 lakh crore as central excise duty. Petrol costs ₹108.20 in the state.2. Chhattisgarh Even though the Congress-ruled state is yet to announce a decision, reports suggest that it is mulling a move to cut VAT on petrol and diesel after Congress-ruled Punjab went ahead with it.3. New DelhiThe Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)-led Delhi government is yet to declare a cut in VAT for fuels. Delhi’s Opposition - comprising the BJP and the Congress - have both demanded an immediate reduction in the taxes. On Saturday, members of New Delhi’s BJP unit protested outside chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s residence over the Capital’s decision not to announce a reduction in VAT.As of Monday, petrol and diesel in Delhi cost ₹103.97 and ₹86.67, respectively.4. JharkhandLike other non-BJP ruled states, Jharkhand is also yet to make an announcement regarding a cut in fuel taxes. The Opposition BJP and the petroleum dealers’ association have put pressure on the Hemant Soren government, seeking a reduction in VAT.5. Kerala The government led by the Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M) made it clear on Friday that it has no plans to go for a cut on VAT. Finance minister KN Balagopal argued that the Centre reduced fuel taxes only marginally. Balagopal termed the Centre’s excise duty cuts a “temporary, face-saving measure” in the light of the nationwide protests against rising fuel prices.6. Maharashtra The Shiv Sena-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government also announced that it will not reduce VAT on petrol and diesel. It argued that it will have to take a hit of ₹1,700 crore for the period from November 2021 to March 2022 as a result of a cut in Central excise duty. The state, which is saddled with a public debt of over ₹6.15 lakh crore, said it doesn’t have the cushion to handle the impact from a revenue loss as it was already struggling with a mismatch in revenue and expenditure.7. Rajasthan The government in the Congress-ruled state is facing pressure from various quarters to cut VAT on fuels. Despite the Centre’s cuts, Rajasthan still has the country’s costliest petrol and diesel prices. In Jaipur, petrol costs ₹111.06 and diesel sells at ₹95.71. The state itself had been asking the Centre to cut excise duty, arguing that VAT could then subsequently be reduced.8. Tamil Nadu The government led by Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK)’s M.K Stalin hasn’t announced reductions in VAT on petrol and diesel. All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) leaders O Panneerselvam and Edappadi Palaniswami pointed out that fuel price reduction was part of the DMK’s election manifesto and cited the examples of several other states that have slashed VAT.9. Telangana Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Sunday ruled out a reduction in VAT. The TRS government hasn’t increased the state taxes on fuels since the formation of Telangana seven years ago. The CM also called upon the Centre to withdraw cess on petrol and fuel, which he said will automatically bring down the prices of petrol and diesel further.10. BengalChief minister Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress (TMC) termed the Centre’s decision to slash excise duty a “mere eyewash”. “The BJP-ruled state governments get their dues from the Centre on account of the taxes it levies, but Bengal remains deprived,” TMC general secretary and spokesperson Kunal Ghosh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/10-non-bjp-states-yet-to-cut-vat-on-petrol-diesel-here-s-what-they-say-101636428484516.html

09-11-2021||India||Kartarpur corridor's second anniversary today, travel remains suspended||Tuesday marks the second anniversary of the opening of the Kartarpur corridor, a visa-free border crossing that connects the Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Pakistan to India. The 4.7-kilometre-long corridor was inaugurated on November 9, 2019 to commemorate the 550th Parkash Gurpurb (birth anniversary) of Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism. It is believed that the Gurudwara Darbar Sahib is the final resting place of Guru Nanak.The gurdwara had faced neglect for 70 years after Independence due to its location along the International Border. The proposal for the Kartarpur corridor was first made in 1999 by former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif. The proposal was part of the Delhi-Lahore bus diplomacy.Before this, Sikh pilgrims from India had to take a bus to Lahore to get to Kartarpur which is an almost 125-kilometre-long journey.Currently, the movement of pilgrims to Pakistan through the Kartarpur corridor has been suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic and the neighbouring country has banned all travel from India citing the surge in cases in April this year. It is shut since March 2020.India had gone ahead with the opening of the corridor last year to respect the sentiments of the Sikh community despite strong misgivings about several steps taken by the Pakistani side, including the imposition of a service fee of $20 on every pilgrim, and security concerns.Following the closure of the corridor in March, Pakistan had offered to reopen it in June. Pakistan has also opened its section of the corridor on the occasion of some Sikh festivals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kartarpur-corridor-s-second-anniversary-today-travel-remains-suspended-101636422167310.html

Now only 177 places are stagnated.”Bedi further said that as many as 1288 people living in low-lying and flood-prone areas have been shifted to shelters operated by the corporation. Around 169 shelters have been readied, and 58 of them are currently occupied. More than 700,000 food packets have been distributed to flood-affected people. The city’s 1913 helpline received more than 1500 calls of complaints.The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) predicted very heavy rainfall for 14 districts of Tamil Nadu, including Chennai, in the next 48-hours. Another low pressure is likely to form in the Bay of Bengal and reach north Tamil Nadu on November 11, the IMD said.The Meteorological department in a bulletin said that the cyclonic circulation over the southeast Bay of Bengal and adjoining the south Andaman sea, extending up to 5.8 kilometres above the mean sea level, persists. “Under its influence, a low-pressure area is very likely to form over southeast Bay of Bengal and neighbourhood during the next 24 hours. It is likely to move west–northwestwards, concentrate into a depression and reach near north Tamil Nadu coast by November 11, early morning and bring widespread rainfall in several regions of the state,” the bulletin said.The government appointed five senior bureaucrats as nodal officers to monitor relief in Chennai and Chengalpattu as the state braces for severe rainfall in the coming days. The civic body deployed 23,000 personnel to help with rain-related work and restore normalcy.

09-11-2021||India||CRPF jawan kills 4, injures 3 colleagues in Chhattisgarh||Four CRPF personnel were killed and three others injured after one of their colleagues opened fire at them at a camp of the paramilitary force in Chhattisgarh’s Sukma district on Monday, a police official said, the fifth such instance of fratricide in the state since 2019. The total toll, including Monday’s, is 15.Police said that the incident occurred at around 3:30 am in the camp of CRPF’s 50th battalion in Lingampalli village of Sukma district of Bastar region.“The CRPF constable Reetesh Ranjan opened fire on his friends with his AK-47 service weapon in which seven CRPF personnel were injured. Two jawans died on the spot while five of the injured were shifted to a hospital in nearby Bhadrachalam in Telangana where doctors declared two of them dead. The condition of the other three is stable,” said Inspector General of Police, Bastar range, Sunderaj P.Police said that the deceased constables were Rajmani Kumar Yadav, Rajib Mondal, Dhanji and Dharmendra Kumar while those injured were Dhananjay Kumar Singh, Dharmatma Kumar and Malay Ranjan Maharana.Superintendent of Police, Sukma, Sunil Sharma, said that the accused has been arrested and is being questioned.“Preliminary investigation suggests that a few days ago, Ranjan got offended with jokes cracked by the jawans (he killed) and nurtured a grudge. On Monday morning, Ranjan, on sentry duty, came to the barracks and opened fire with his AK-47, injuring seven people. Other jawans overpowered him after the incident and handed him over to the police,” said Sharma adding that exact reason behind the incident is being probed.“Because there are fewer mobile towers in Sukma and other nearby districts, there is lack of communication between a jawan and his family, which is also a reason behind taking these extreme steps. The government in 2018 started a Sapandan Campaign to contain these incidents but nothing concrete has been done,” said an IPS officer who asked not to be named.Under the Sapandan Campaign, Yoga training, weapon handling and outdoor sports were made mandatory.Another senior officer claimed that suicides and fratricides in Bastar are also caused by difficulty in getting leave sanctioned and homesickness. “Chhattisgarh police records broadly categorise 50% of the suicides as having been caused by personal and, or family reasons, 11% on account of illness, 8% as work-related, and 13% under other reasons.The remaining 18% continue to be under investigation,” added this officer, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/crpfjawan-kills-4-injures-3-colleagues-in-chhattisgarh-101636410677551.html
09-11-2021||India||Was a stop-gap arrangement, says SC on plea to continue virtual hearing in HCs||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday decided to hear in December a petition challenging discontinuation of the virtual hearing mode by high courts, which are gradually resuming to full-fledged physical hearing of cases.Listing the petition filed by All India Association of Jurists on December 6, the bench of justices L Nageswar Rao and AS Oka said, “We are also opening up now. Let us open fully and then we can hear the petition.”Senior advocate Sidharth Luthra who appeared for the petitioner body which said it represents 5,000 lawyers practising across the country said that there was urgency in the matter as several high courts were closing the option of the virtual court hearing. He cited the example of high court of Madhya Pradesh which it said, was the latest high court to stop virtual hearings Similar orders were passed earlier by the high courts of Uttarakhand and Gujarat.On September 6, the top court issued notice on this petition but the matter could not be taken up since.Luthra said, “By the time this court opens up fully for physical hearing, this petition will become infructuous. This raises a fundamental issue of access to cheap, affordable justice as litigants can participate in the proceedings.”The bench said there was access to justice for the past 70 years without virtual hearings and the virtual hearing was meant to be a stop-gap arrangement for courts to function during the pandemic. “Continuation of courts virtually will be a problem as completing even 30 matters is becoming difficult. During physical hearings, we managed to dispose of over 65 matters in a day.”In addition, the bench pointed out that it was good to see senior lawyers appearing in person and making arguments than appearing on screen. “Your arguments are more effective when you appear physically than on the screen.” The court added that the fundamental rights of litigants matter more than lawyers who are representing the petition for a continuation of the virtual hearing mode.This is not the only petition for continuing with virtual court proceedings that the top court is hearing. On October 8, the top court issued notice on a petition filed by ex-CIC Shailesh Gandhi, former Mumbai police commissioner Julio Ribeiro and the National Federation of Societies for Fast Justice.This petition sought a direction from the top court barring high courts from discontinuing the virtual hearing of cases. While dealing with the matter, the court clarified that virtual courts cannot become a norm.At the Supreme Court, physical hearing of cases was made mandatory on Wednesdays and Thursdays but this was objected to by senior counsels led by Kapil Sibal. Following deliberations, the top court amended its standard operating procedure (SOP) issued on October 7 giving judges the discretion to allow lawyers to address arguments virtually.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/was-a-stop-gap-arrangement-says-sc-on-plea-to-continue-virtual-hearing-in-hcs-101636403401888.html

He said, “The petitioner wants a mandate that Covid vaccine should not be administered. I wonder what kind of interests he represents. Let the country go the way it is going.”Pulayil was represented in Court by advocate Prashant Bhushan who pointed out that many persons were losing jobs due to the insistence on vaccination by government and public institutions.Mehta told the court that he received instructions from the government for filing a response considering the nature of prayers sought. The bench accepted the request and posted the matter for hearing on November 29.Earlier, while issuing notice on the petition, the bench cautioned that its decision to entertain the petition should not be construed as a signal on the safety of vaccines.The petition demanded the government and the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) to provide segregated data for each of the phases of clinical trials undertaken with regard to the Covid vaccines administered in India. Vaccine manufacturers, Covaxin producer Bharat Biotech and Covishield producer Serum Institute of India were also named as respondents in the petition.The petition raised a legal issue on the personal autonomy of citizens and the balance to be struck between the right to livelihood and the right to public health. On August 9, the bench said, “We cannot take responsibility of passing any order which can increase the number of casualties or endanger public health.”The court, while issuing notice on the petition, was conscious of vaccine hesitancy in rural areas and said, “Our apprehension is that a detailed enquiry into this issue will amount to throwing a spanner into what already exists leading to more doubts.”The petition claimed that the emergency use authorization to the two vaccines was given in clear violation of the basic norms of scientific disclosures and the guidelines with respect to the disclosure of clinical trial data, laid down by the World Health Organization (WHO) and followed by the ICMR.It also quoted the Helsinki Declaration of 2013 on Ethical Principles for Medical Research involving Human Subject adopted by the World Medical Association which casts a duty on researchers to publicly disclose all negative, inconclusive and positive results of their research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-gives-centre-more-time-to-respond-to-petition-on-vaccine-101636402387361.html

SSP Fatehgarh Ashok Meena had categorically denied police firing and maintained that the police would look into the reasons that led to Shivam’s death.The post-mortem report showed that the bullet was found lodged in the left side of the waist area, said the doctor and police officer privy to the findings.“He died of the bullet wound. The bullet ruptured the vital organs, and there was excessive loss of blood,” they said.Director general, prisons, Anand Kumar, visited the Fatehgarh jail on Monday. Asked about Shivam’s death due to a bullet injury, he said he hadn’t seen the post-mortem report yet, but the fact had been brought to his knowledge.“I haven’t seen the autopsy report. Yes, it has (Shivam died of a bullet injury) been brought to my knowledge. We are looking into it,” he told reporters.The prisoners had taken control of the prison for more than three hours on Sunday after a convict, Sandip Yadav, died of dengue in the hospital. His death led to a series of violent protests, with inmates alleging that Yadav was not given proper and timely treatment.In the violence that ensued, one prisoner was killed and three others, along with 30 policemen, were injured. The prisoners set the jail hospital and four other places on fire. Police suspect that the violence was a cover for a jailbreak planned by some hardcore criminals.Yadav, whose death triggered the violence, had written to the district magistrate, Farrukhabad, on October 24 alleging that he was not being given proper treatment by the jail authorities. Apart from Yadav, the letter was signed by 15 other jail inmates supporting his contention of being maltreated. Yadav said he was unwell since October 18, but all he was getting was one tablet a day. A copy of the letter is with HT.In addition, Yadav said when he complained to the jailor and the deputy jailor, he was threatened. He demanded that he be treated by a doctor at the district hospital. DG, prisons, Kumar said a three-member inquiry team was formed to look into lapses on the part of the jail administration. “It will not be appropriate at this point of time to make any further comment,” he said, adding that action would be taken against jail staff and officials if found guilty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fatehgarh-jail-violence-prisoner-died-due-to-bullet-injury-reveals-autopsy-101636400821716.html
09-11-2021||India||Cost of electric vehicles will be on a par with petrol variants in 2 years: Nitin Gadkari||New Delhi: Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari said that the cost of electric vehicles (EV) in India will drop to the level of petrol vehicles in the next two years.“Within two years, the cost of EVs will come down to a level that will be at par with their petrol variants. Already GST is only 5% on EVs and the cost of lithium ion batteries is also declining. Besides, the government has already framed a policy allowing petrol pumps to set up EV charging stations. In two years there will be a lot charging points across India as well,” Gadkari said at a webinar, organised by The Sustainability Foundation, Denmark, on accelerating the phasing out of coal and switching to electric vehicles, in the national capital on Sunday evening. “Electric mobility is gaining good momentum in the country. There is no artificial push required. The per kilometre cost of petrol-based vehicle is ₹10, that of diesel is ₹7/km, whereas for EVs, it is ₹1/km,” he said.This is significant because by 2030, India has set a target of 30% EV sales penetration for private cars, 70% for commercial vehicles, 40% for buses and 80% for two- and three-wheelers. At present, only about 2-3 e-car variants cost below ₹15 lakh in the country. The cost of two-wheelers and three-wheelers have already almost come at par with the existing petrol after factoring in the subsidies. Gadkari further said that a potential pilot project is being planned to install an electric highway system in the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway which can be electrified using abundant solar power energy in the region. Apart from this, the government also plans to set up charging points at fuel stations. The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has chalked out a plan to install at least 700 EV charging stations across its major highways in the country by 2023. These will be spread across a range of 40-60kms. The Union minister said that the central government is also focusing on ensuring that EV charging stations get their electricity from renewable sources. The government will also soon launch the country’s fully electric tractor, the minister added. This comes months after Gadkari introduced the country’s first-ever tractor run on CNG in February this year. “There is no benefit in producing coal based electricity. Our attention is now on renewable sources such as solar, tidal, wind energy and biomass. Domestic EV charging can be fulfilled through rooftop solar system. The average retail electricity charge across the country is as high as ₹7-8 kWh, that of backup power with diesel generator sets is as high as ₹20/kwh. Meanwhile, solar power is less than ₹2/kwh today. So, rooftop solar system can address the twin problem of high electricity cost and grid reliability,” he said.At present, India has world’s fourth largest renewable energy capacity at 145 GW. Gadkari said domestic EV charging through solar PV cells, panel system at homes, malls, parking lots and offices would make EVs more affordable and adaptable. The country has seen an increased demand for small battery operated vehicles such as e-scooters, e-carts, e-autos, e-bicycles in the past two years, Gadkari said.Electric two-wheeler and electric car sales have seen a rise of 145% and 190% respectively when compared to the pre-Covid period, he said. India has the potential to become an exporter in these two segments of EVs, the minister added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cost-of-electric-vehicles-will-be-on-a-par-with-petrol-variants-in-2-years-nitin-gadkari-101636400406139.html
09-11-2021||India||Madras high court quashes defamation case against DMK MP Kanimozhi||The Madras high court on Monday quashed a criminal defamation case filed against DMK MP Kanimozhi Karunanidhi for allegedly accusing former Tamil Nadu minister Edappadi Palaniswami of corruption during the AIADMK regime. In 2018, Kanimozhi had participated in a DMK-led protest in Villupuram where she criticised the then chief minister Palaniswami. The DMK, which formed the government in May, was then the opposition party. A defamation case was filed against Kanimozhi in Villupuram district court under Section 499 of Indian Penal Code (Central Act XLV of 1860) punishable under Section 500 of the IPC, following which she approached the high court and filed a quash petition in 2019. In her petition, she stated that she was misquoted and that a complaint was filed against her based on hearsay of two witnesses who attended her speech. She had listed the “gross failures of the government, its corruption and non-adherence to poll promises,” in her speech, Kanimozhi stated in her affidavit. She added that no public servant has absolute immunity and gets protection against criticism from the opposition or public.“Mr Palaniswami filed a criminal complaint through the Public Prosecutor,” said DMK Rajya Sabha MP and senior advocate P Wilson, appearing for Kanimozhi. He argued that the Public Prosecutor’s office was being misused and abused by the AIADMK to file cases against the opposition for political gains. “There can’t be protection from defamation in case of corruption, and the state cannot defend the corrupt chief minister through its resources, time and machinery,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madras-high-court-quashes-defamation-case-against-dmk-mp-kanimozhi-101636400283515.html
09-11-2021||India||Din in Kerala house on Mullaperiyar tree felling order||The Kerala assembly on Monday witnessed a huge protest against the CPI (M)-led government’s decision to allow Tamil Nadu to cut trees near the Baby dam in Mullaperiyar, which was later revoked, with the Congress-led Opposition seeking a judicial inquiry into the ‘flip-flop’ and a response from chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan. Moving an adjournment motion, Kerala Congress leader Thiruvanchur Radhakrishnan said it was a serious issue and asked how the officials issued the permission without the notice of the government. He further said the government had frozen the controversial order, but was yet to cancel it, which points towards a conspiracy. Vijayan continued his silence and left it to state forest minister A K Saseendran to defend the government’s decision and the revocation later. The minister reiterated that it was a lapse on the part of some forest officials, and they will be dealt with firmly. “There is no change in the government’s position on Mullaperiyar – safety for Kerala and water for Tamil Nadu. The state assembly had passed a unanimous resolution in 2014 on this, and there is no dilution,” said Saseendran. The minister also said the government was inquiring into circumstances that led to the issue of such an order and assured agitated members that action will be taken against responsible officers. He explained that it came to the notice of the government only after Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin sent a letter to Vijayan thanking him for the permission. In response, opposition leader V D Satheesan said the government was making officials a scapegoat to get away from severe embarrassment. “Even a small child knows it well that an official can’t issue such an order without the knowledge of the political leadership. The government is trying to hide its lapses, and we need a judicial inquiry into this,” he said. “This will not happen without the knowledge of the CM. He has to shed his silence,” said BJP state president K Surendran.However, Speaker M B Rajesh ruled that since the minister explained the position, there was no need for an adjournment motion. Angry opposition members later staged a walkout raising slogans that the government sacrificed the state’s interests. Two neighbouring states have been fighting over the 126-year-old dam for more than two decades. The issue came to light again after torrential rains claimed many lives in the Idukki district last month. Tamil Nadu said it was routine for Kerala to trigger panic, but the latter cited unusual rain patterns and recurring calamities in the state to prove its point. Political parties on both sides have whipped up the emotional issue unmindful of panic triggered downstream of the dam. The dam is built in the Periyar river inside the Periyar tiger reserve. Its water is diverted to the Suruliyar river, a tributary of the Vaigai river, a source of agriculture and drinking water in five districts of southern Tamil Nadu. Besides this, Tamil Nadu takes water through huge penstock pipes and underground tunnels. Though the Mullaperiyar dam is in Kerala, it is controlled and operated by Tamil Nadu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/din-in-kerala-house-on-mullaperiyar-tree-felling-order-101636400223628.html

According to the schedule announced by the EC, the filing of nominations will commence on Tuesday, and the last date for the same will be November 16. The scrutiny of nominations will be held on November 17, and the last date for withdrawal of nominations is November 22. The polling, if required, will be held on November 29 from 9 am to 4 pm; and the counting of votes will take place on the same day from 5 pm. The vacancies in the two-state legislative councils have arisen due to the completion of the term of the sitting MLCs. In Andhra Pradesh, the term of three MLCs – Chinna Govinda Reddy Devasani (YSR Congress party), Mohammed Ahmed Shariff (Telugu Desam Party) and Somu Veerraju (Bharatiya Janata Party) – ended on May 31 last. Similarly, the term of six MLCs in Telangana -- Akula Lalitha, Mohammed Fareeduddin, Gutha Sukender Reddy, Vidyasagar Nethi, Venkateshwartu Rodakunti and Kadiyam Srihari (all Telangana Rashtra Samithi) – came to an end on June 3. The elections, supposed to be held in May, were postponed due to the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. The EC said it would take up the election after the pandemic situation significantly improves and conditions become conducive to hold above mentioned biennial elections. These MLCs have to be elected by the members of the state legislative assembly (MLAs). The YSRCP in Andhra Pradesh and the TRS in Telangana are expected to win the seats, as they have sufficient MLAs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mlcpolls-in-andhra-telangana-likely-on-nov-29-101636400221542.html

Following this, Kerala University of Digital Sciences, Innovation and Technology ordinance was published in January, 2020.To address the growing demand of skilled candidates for the fourth industrial revolution, the state government had officially inaugurated DUK at the Technocity campus in February this year.With a strong innovation cluster, latest facilities and renowned faculty, the Digital University Kerala has started admissions to its master programmes in cutting edge technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Cyber Security, Internet of Things etc, it said.The DUK has AICTE-approved MTech courses and MSc course and PhD programmes approved by UGC.The courses are conducted under its five schools - School of Computer Science and Engineering, Electronic Systems and Automation, Informatics, Digital Sciences and Digital Humanities and Liberal Arts.It has a range of innovation centres and centres of excellence such as Maker Village, Kerala Blockchain Academy, Centre of Excellence in Intelligent IoT sensors, thingQbator etc.The courses of DUK are designed to give students the opportunity to understand and identify real world problems and find solutions through innovations, the statement added.The DUK campus at Technocity is equipped with state-of-the –art labs and residential facilities for students||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/digital-university-act-2021-comes-into-effect-in-kerala-101636400163831.html
09-11-2021||India||KCR: BJP government’s strategy is to brand its critics ‘anti-nationals’||Telangana Rashtra Samithi president and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Monday accused the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Narendra Modi government of branding all those who opposed its policies as “Desh Drohis” (anti-nationals).Addressing a late evening press conference for the second consecutive day, the chief minister alleged that the Centre was systematically targeting its opponents by calling them “anti-nationals or Urban Naxals”. “If they are the political rivals of the BJP, the Centre would unleash its agencies like the Income Tax department or the Enforcement Directorate to harass them,” he said.KCR was referring to the statement of Telangana BJP president Bandi Sanjay calling the chief minister a “Desh Drohi” for pointing out the inaction of the Central government when China was building villages on the borders of Arunachal Pradesh.“How can I be called a Desh Drohi for pointing out the illegal occupation of our territories by China and calling for an appropriate action by the Central government?” he asked.He alleged that even the farmers who were agitating against the draconian farm laws were branded as anti-nationals. KCR pointed out that even Meghalaya Governor Satyapal Malik and BJP MP Varun Gandhi extended support to the agitating farmers. “Will they, too, be called Desh Drohis?” he questioned.The chief minister took exception to the state BJP president’s comment that he would soon be thrown behind the bars. “I am not scared of such threats. You can’t do anything to me, as I don’t have businesses and illegally-amassed wealth, nor am I indulging in any money laundering. If you try to intimidate me, it will only boomerang on you,” he said.Accusing the Centre of cheating Telangana farmers by refusing to buy paddy this season, KCR declared that his party would organise massive protest dharnas across the state on Friday, demanding that the Centre purchase all the paddy from Telangana, as it was doing in Punjab.“If the state BJP leaders have any love for farmers, they should join us in the protests against the Centre,” he said.The chief minister further said his party would also take up protest demonstrations demanding that the Centre withdraw cess being collected on petrol and diesel.The BJP is yet to respond to KCR’s comments.Meanwhile, following KCR’s suit, the YS Jagan Mohan Reddy government in Andhra Pradesh, too, demanded the Centre to either withdraw cess on petrol and diesel or share the proceeds of the cess with the states before asking them to reduce the VAT.Advisor to the state government on public affairs Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy said the relief given by the Centre in the form of reducing the fuel prices by ₹5 on petrol and ₹10 on diesel was very insignificant compared to what it had collected in the form of cess.“It is like increasing the prices of a product abnormally and later announcing a marginal discount for the consumers,” he said.He said the Centre had so far collected nearly ₹3.60 lakh crore from fuel prices, of which nearly ₹3.13 lakh crore was pocketed by it in the form of cess. Only ₹ 47,500 crores were collected in the form of excise duty, of which only ₹19,475 crores was shared with the states in the form of tax devolution, he pointed out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kcr-bjp-government-s-strategy-is-to-brand-its-critics-antinationals-101636400161924.html
09-11-2021||India||Expansion a major cause of flooding in Chennai: Experts||Even as the heavy rainfall, lashing Chennai and its neighbouring districts since Saturday, subsided on Monday, experts said flooding would remain a perennial problem in the city due to its expansion taking over natural water drainage systems and flood plains.Most of the roads and bylanes in city are covered under sheets of water while there was water up to two feet in low lying localities. Overnight, Chennai recorded 21 cm of rainfall between November 6 and 7, causing severe inundation. This was the city’s highest single-day rainfall for November since 2015. The intensity of the rains reduced on Monday, with Chennai’s Nungambakkam station registering 14.5 mm of rainfall up to 5.30 p.m.Following the floods in 2015, the state as well as the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) in their budgets had announced several projects to improve the stormwater drain network. Chennai corporation in its 2016-17 budget allocated ₹415 crores for the drainage system.Between October 2011 and June 2016, the corporation laid around 565 km of new drains. Chennai, as of today, has 2,071 km of stormwater drain network. Civic authorities at that time had also found that a crucial factor that links the drain network was largely either absent or broken, officials said.‘Missing links’ were identified for 33 locations in Chennai’s central city and 278 locations in the extended areas, they added. Projects to build drains and links receive funding from the World Bank, Asian Development Bank and German-based KfW bank to the tune of more than ₹5,000 crores, spanning across the past few years, they said.A massive integrated stormwater drain network project announced in 2014 by the city corporation to connect them to the four river basins Adyar, Cooum, Kosasthalaiyar, and Kovalam is still in progress.The area under the Chennai Corporation was expanded from 176 sq km to 426 sq km in 2011, following which the basic road infrastructure for extended areas is still not in place. Based on topography, the corporation and the Public Works Department have divided Chennai into four watershed basins, comprising 12 major catchments. Work for about 406 km of drains for the basins in Adyar and Cooum combined was completed last year and civic officials say that this has helped decrease flooding in the south and central parts of Chennai in the present rains.“In 2015, water was stagnant in localities such as Valasaravakkam for a week. Due to the new drains, there has been no stagnation,” said a senior civic official not wishing to be named.The work includes the building of collector drains, feeder drains, arterial drains and macro and major micro canals to prevent flooding. Work is ongoing in the ISWD network to cover 763km for Kosasthalaiyar Basin in north Chennai and 360-km for Kovalam in the south. “It will take two years to complete,” the civic official said.“The ISWDs are designed in a scientific way to prevent a worst-case scenario, like the 2015 floods.” In 2015, the local body had identified 588 spots where flooding probability was high. However, after the unprecedented rainfall and flooding, the corporation revised this number to around 820.The coastal city of Chennai is essentially a flat terrain dotted with wetlands where excess water can drain into, but it has been occupied for residential, commercial and industrial projects. A study by Chennai-based biodiversity research organisation Earth Trust states that only 15% of the city’s wetlands are left. Their findings show that Chennai’s built-up area grew from 47 sq km in 1980 to 402 sq km in 2012 - while the area under wetlands declined from 186 sq km to 71sq km during the same period. The study also found that most of the water bodies affected were in the southern and western suburbs.This can be attributed to the Information Technology boom in Chennai in the 1990s where IT parks came up in the south which was accompanied by increased residential projects.“Due to overall dense urbanisation where there is too much concrete and tar and no natural buffers like lakes and open spaces, rainwater can’t move anywhere so it stagnates,” said Raj Bhagat, senior manager, GeoAnalytics, World Resources Institute-India.“Chennai’s terrain is close to the sea level, so you require larger conduits. The stormwater drains are not scientifically designed according to rainfall data though officials may claim that. So when there are no natural buffers and inadequate road infrastructure, Chennai will continue to flood.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/expansion-a-major-cause-of-flooding-in-chennaiexperts-101636400105508.html
09-11-2021||India||List reasons for not including diesel, petrol under GST, Kerala high court asks council||The Kerala high court on Monday asked the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council why petroleum products can’t come under the GST and directed it to file a reply in ten days. Hearing public interest litigation (PIL), a division bench of Chief Justice S Manikumar and Justice Shaji P Chaly directed the GST Council to explain reasons for not including petrol and diesel within the ambit of GST. The PIL was filed by Kerala Pradesh Gandhi Darshanvadi, a voluntary organization. Its counsel Arun B Varghese contended that the price of petrol and diesel vary in different states according to the tax levied by them and sought a uniform tax regime for petroleum products. The petition also cited that though the Union and state governments plead helplessness in this citing, petroleum marketing companies enthusiastically participated in the reduction of fuel price before elections. “Now different rates are being charged in different states and same is due to a different rate of tax levied by the state governments under their fragmented taxing policies. This impedes harmonised national market as contemplated under Article 279(A) 6 of the constitution,” the PIL said. It also said the state and central taxes account for at least 60 per cent of the price of one-litre fuel. If petrol and diesel are brought under the GST, there will be a harmonious market throughout the nation and the maximum tax rate will be 28%, it said, adding that even people who are not direct consumers of fuel are affected by the unprecedented price hike. “A welfare state must be the one where everyone is in a position to bear expenses of basic amenities. The unprecedented hike in fuel prices push the public to immense hardships by which their right to life guaranteed under Article 21 is violated,” the petition said. Respondents in the PIL are the Union of India, Kerala government, petroleum secretary, Goods and Service Tax Council and three major oil companies. The Centre and GST Council can’t argue that if the fuel was included in the GST it would have serious implications on revenue collection. A constitutional duty was cast upon the GST Council to make a serious recommendation to include both (petrol and diesel) under the GST, the PIL said. “To declare the non-inclusion of petrol and diesel under the GST regime are violative of the Article 14 and 21 of the constitution.” The PIL was first filed in July but it was withdrawn later after the court pointed out some glitches and they were corrected in the new one which was readily admitted by the court, said the counsel. Earlier the counsel for both union and state governments opposed the PIL, saying the fuel price regime was part of a policy decision and the judiciary can’t intervene.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/list-reasons-for-not-including-diesel-petrol-under-gst-kerala-high-court-asks-council-101636400103858.html
09-11-2021||India||Criminal justice system is reform-oriented: Supreme Court||The criminal justice system in India is reform-oriented and does not seek to punish criminals, said the Supreme Court while directing the Uttar Pradesh government to consider afresh the premature release pleas of more than 100 life convicts languishing in jail for over 16 years.“The idea of punishment has to be reformative,” the bench said, adding, “We do not want to punish persons. They must be reformed and sent back to society. Any policy must consider this aspect of reformation in it,” said a bench of justices S Abdul Nazeer and Krishna Murari while dealing with a petition filed by 113 life convicts from Uttar Pradesh for premature release.The petition by convicts filed earlier this year relied on a premature release policy issued on August 1, 2018, by the state under the UP Prisoners’ Release on Probation Act. Every year, on Republic Day, the state granted remission to prisoners under Article 161, the governor’s power of clemency. In January 2020, the petitioners became entitled to premature release as they had completed a minimum of 16 years of imprisonment under the 2018 policy. But they did not figure in the list of prisoners released in 2020 and 2021. On July 28, 2021, an amendment to the 2018 policy was made, restricting the benefit to prisoners aged 60 years and above. The same was to apply retrospectively.Not happy with the state’s amended policy, the bench said on Monday, “We are of the view that that the un-amended policy dated August 1, 2018, should be applicable to the petitioners.” The court directed the state to consider or even reconsider the premature release of the petitioners within six weeks.The convicts, all lodged at Bareilly Jail, represented by senior advocate ZU Khan and advocate Anu Gupta submitted to the apex court that the amended policy should not be applied retrospectively as the 113 convicts became eligible for release before the coming of the amendment. Gupta said that all the convicts are either young or middle-aged and are bound to be disqualified if the age bar of 60 years is to be applied in their case. Further, they argued that it amounted to discrimination as a 45-year-old person who commits murder will get premature release as compared to a relatively younger convict who is in jail for a similar offence.The bench said, “Suppose a person is convicted for murder at the age of 20, should he wait for another 40 years to be eligible for premature release? Then what is the purpose of calling it premature release? During this time, if he studies or secures a PhD, what is the harm if he wishes to become a teacher?”The state argued through additional advocate general Garima Prashad that no convict has an absolute right to premature release on the completion of 16 years imprisonment. Since the petitioners were murder convicts sentenced to life imprisonment, she said, “Life imprisonment is imprisonment for the whole of the convict’s natural life, as held by the Supreme Court in a series of judgments. These petitions do not challenge the amended policy of July 2021. This aspect is being considered by a separate bench of the Supreme Court.”Arguing in the present case earlier, the state government had filed an affidavit stating that the power to remit or refuse to remit the sentence of a life convict is the discretion of the state and the petitioners’ cases will be strictly considered according to the amended policy. But even here, there were discrepancies as two convicts among the 113 had been refused premature release despite being aged above 60 years. This is not the first time the Supreme Court has leaned in favour of prisoners languishing in Uttar Pradesh jails. In September, a bench of the Supreme Court granted bail to 97 life convicts languishing in UP jails for more than 20 years with no certainty about their appeals being taken up by the Allahabad high court and the high court bench at Lucknow. In this petition, the convicts had questioned the amendment to the 2018 premature release policy of the state government.There are over 7,200 convicts in UP who have spent over 10 years in jail and are awaiting a decision on their appeals. At present, nearly 1.83 lakh criminal appeals are pending consideration before Allahabad HC. These figures were presented by the state government before the Supreme Court in August this year where the court was considering a petition by 18 life convicts whose appeals were pending for years together without any hearing on their bail as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/criminal-justice-system-is-reform-oriented-supreme-court-101636399321478.html

We have decided to implement the project in accordance with law and will do it. But I don’t know why Congress is remembering Mekedatu now?. When their government was in power they did not pay attention to it and now when BJP is in power they are talking about it,” Eshwarappa said.Speaking to reporters here, he said, “Who told them (Congress) that we will not implement the Mekedatu project? If you go on politicising every issue, development of the state will not be possible. Whether it is ruling or opposition, we have never played politics over the issue of Mekedatu or the state’s water. I appeal to them not to do politics.” The Rural Development Minister further asserted that the Karnataka government will definitely implement the project. “Let there be no doubts about it.” Eshwarappa was reacting to Karnataka Congress’ announcement on Sunday to organise a ‘Padayatra’ (march) from Mekedatu to Bengaluru, a distance of over 100 km, probably during the first week of December, demanding implementation of the project.To a question on whether the Congress’ Padayatra was inappropriate, he said, “if they want to do it for the sake of politics and to show they are involved in activities as an opposition party, let them do it. Whether they do Padayatra or not, we will implement the Mekedatu project.” Mekedatu is a multi-purpose (drinking and power) project, which involves building a balancing reservoir near Kanakapura in Ramanagara district.Neighbouring Tamil Nadu has been opposing the project, raising apprehensions that the state would be affected if the project takes shape.The project, once completed, is aimed at ensuring drinking water to Bengaluru and neighbouring areas (4.75 TMC) and also can generate 400 MW power, and the estimated cost of the project is ₹9,000 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-do-politics-over-mekedatu-project-eshwarappa-tells-congress-101636399021348.html
09-11-2021||India||Mumbai-Karnataka region to be renamed Kittur-K’taka: Karnataka Govt||The Basavaraj Bommai-led Bharatiya Janata Party government (BJP) on Monday approved the rechristening of “Mumbai-Karnataka” as “Kittur-Karnataka” to sever any ties to the erstwhile Bombay presidency or colonial-era nomenclature. Around seven districts were included into Karnataka when the reorganisation of states had been done in 1956. “It was decided to rechristen as we didn’t want to refer to the region as Bombay-Karnataka or Mumbai-Karnataka,” JC Madhuswamy, the minister for law, parliamentary affairs and minor irrigation, said after a cabinet meeting. While Karnataka celebrates Kannada Rajyotsava on November 1, the Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti (MES), a group of native Marathi speakers, observe a black day as they claim to have been forcibly separated from their parent state 66 years ago during the reorganisation exercise. The renaming has two benefits -- one is to shrug off any ties to Mumbai and Maharashtra as well as naming the region after 19th century ruler Kittur Rani Chennamma, who is from the dominant Panchamasalis, the largest sub-sect within the Lingayats.In 2012, the state government inaugurated the Suvarana Vidhana Soudha, a replica of the Vidhana Soudha in Bengaluru, where it holds the winter session of the state legislature, to further thwart any claims of territory from the neighbouring state. This region, among the most backward in the state and country, includes districts of Uttara Kannada, Belagavi, Dharwad, Vijayapura, Bagalkote, Gadag and Haveri. The change in name has been a long-standing demand by pro-Kannada organisations. Kittur Rani Chenamma, one of the first rulers to take on the British, ruled the region from 1778 to 1829. The Karnataka government has been trying to rid itself of nomenclature in regions that came under the newly formed state of Karnataka in 1956. The northern and north-eastern districts came from Bombay presidency and Nizams while some regions in the south were from the Madras presidency. In 2019, the BS Yediyurappa government had renamed Hyderabad-Karnataka region as Kalyana-Karnataka. The rechristened region would also be a move to assuage simmering tensions between the government and the Panchamasali who have been intensifying its demands to be included in the 2A category of the state reservation list. Influential seers and other leaders of the Panchamsalis have demanded that their reservation-related request be met at the earliest, failing which the community would revive its agitation. The community has already started to mobilise support for its cause and the government continues to reassure the group of appropriate action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbaikarnataka-region-to-be-renamed-kittur-k-taka-karnataka-govt-101636398901681.html
09-11-2021||India||Karnataka govt okays new sand policy||The Karnataka cabinet on Monday approved a new sand policy that is expected to bring down cost of the material and put greater regulation over chances of over exploitation of the resource. JC Madhuswamy, Karnataka’s minister for law and parliamentary affairs, said the new policy was approved under three categories which would give greater powers to local administrative bodies. “We have made it easy to procure sand in Karnataka,” Madhuswamy said in Bengaluru. Sand in gram panchayat would be sold at ₹300 per tonne, while riverbed sand is fixed at ₹700 per tonne to be sold at urban, inter-districts and other areas. The minister said a separate authority would be constituted with enforcement and monitoring of any sand mining. The government has identified 183 sand blocks in the state. The state government has fixed ₹300 per tonne for extracting sand from pits and ponds, HT reported on February 10. These measures, the government has said, is to allow local administration to find a new revenue stream from sand that is mined from the ponds and pits in these regions. The developments come at a time when illegal sand mining and other activities has seen a rise in recent months in a state which has borne the extreme weather that fluctuates between droughts and floods. The sight of tractors and other vehicles extracting sand, illegally and legally, from river beds, lakes and other places is common in rural areas of the state. However, the minister said divers who extract sand will continue to be allowed to safeguard their livelihoods but there will no usage of machinery for the same. He said it would be allowed only in small scale in non-CEZ area but it is illegal to use machinery. . For rural housing and other government-sanctioned projects, sand would be sold at a discounted price. The Basavaraj Bommai-led cabinet also decided to approve amendments to the Karnataka Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 1994, under which the lease period for both minor and major minerals mined in a particular area would be the same, which is about 50 years.“Along with major minerals, some minor minerals are also being mined in the same areas in several regions of the state. The Centre gives a 50-year lease for major minerals, but for minor minerals the State used to give for 20 or 30 years. So we are now changing it. So, whatever mining is done in a particular area, it will be for 50 years in line with the major mining policy,” Madhuswamy said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-govt-okays-new-sand-policy-101636398781468.html

According to a statement from the IMD, heavy rains are the result of cyclonic depressions over the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal.Heavy rains will be witnessed in Bengaluru city, Bengaluru Rural, Chamarajanagar, Chikkaballapur, Chikmagalur, Chitradurga, Hassan, Kodagu, Mandya, Mysuru, Ramnagar, and Shivmogga districts. Rains are also going to lash coastal districts of Dakshina Kannada, Udupi, and Uttara Kannada. North interior Karnataka districts are going to witness average to scattered rainfall.“The cyclonic circulation over the southeast Bay of Bengal and adjoining south the Andaman Sea... Under its influence, a low-pressure area is very likely to form over the southeast Bay of Bengal and the neighborhood during the next 24 hours. It is likely to move west-northwestwards, concentrate into a depression and reach near north Tamil Nadu coast by the early morning on Thursday,” the IMD said in a statement.Scattered rain was reported from Bengaluru city on Monday.Meanwhile, Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai said the state government will take short and long-term steps to ensure more drain-related works are taken up during summer months to avoid a repeat of flooding each time it rains in Bengaluru.The chief minister held a meeting with senior officials after entire Bengaluru had flood-like conditions after Thursday night’s downpour, which stands testimony to the city’s poor quality of infrastructure and planning.“Whenever there are monsoons, low-lying areas, wherever there is waterlogging, identify it and find the reasons for it. We have to take immediate steps for short and long-term plans and ensure water does not enter such homes,” Bommai said in Bengaluru.According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), at least 18 people lost their lives in Bengaluru due to civic apathy that is more than all other major cities combined.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/met-office-sounds-alert-for-heavy-rain-in-13-karnataka-districts-101636398723820.html
09-11-2021||India||Karnataka: Prime accused in Bitcoin case held on drug charges||A day after he was detained for creating ruckus at a five-star hotel in the city, Bengaluru police on Monday arrested hacker Sri Krishna on charges of consuming narcotics. Sri Krishna is also the prime accused in the case involving cryptocurrency, in which the Opposition had alleged the involvement of some BJP leaders.A senior police officer in the know of the development said ever since the Opposition has leveled allegations against the BJP leaders there was pressure on police. Even though he was arrested on charges of consumption of narcotics, he was interrogated by senior police officers, including officers from the Central Crime Branch probing the case involving theft of Bitcoins.The officer said Sri Krishna was living in the hotel in Domlur for more than a month. On Saturday, a person by the name Vishnu Bhat came to the hotel and tried to go to Sri Krishna’s room without providing details to security guards. When the hotel staff tried to stop him, there was an altercation and police were called in.After detaining Sri Krishna and Bhat , police conducted a blood test on both of them and found that they had consumed marijuana. Based on this medical test, both were booked under the Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act. Police claimed that they had searched the police searched the room of Sri Krishna and home of Bhat and recovered 10 cigarettes with marijuana. Both men are currently in police custody.Sri Krishna was caught on November 8 after police arrested some drug dealers to whom he had allegedly sold drugs procured from the dark web. Sri Krishna graduated in computer science from a college in Amsterdam in the Netherlands in 2017 and has good knowledge about computers and the internet. A senior police officer said Sri Krishna would encrypt data and demand payment from owners for the site to be unlocked by attacking the sites online.When he was arrested police had claimed that they had seized ₹9 crore worth of Bitcoins from him. However, when the charge sheet filed against him in connection with the hacking case makes no mention of the bitcoins recovered from him. Similarly, Hemanth Mudappa, who was named in the initial complaint by police for his involvement in the case, did not find any mention in the charge sheet.Apart from this, police are accused of failing to inform central agencies about Sri Krishna’s involvement in the infamous Bitfinex cryptocurrency exchange hack in 2016. The Bitfinex hack had alerted international authorities as 1.19 lakh bitcoins were stolen in 2016 and it is considered one of the biggest crypto exchange hacking so far.“Police knew about this in 2020 following his interrogation, but the police department shared this information with the central agencies in April 2021. Even the details mentioned in the charge sheet make it clear that investigators were aware of his involvement, but they informed the CBI about this only after a nudge came from the central agencies. So, there is pressure on the investigators, especially CCB over this,” said the senior officer.It was an ED probe into an 11-month-old case in Bengaluru involving a cryptocurrency hacker Sri Krishna alias Sriki that snowballed into a political controversy with the Opposition accusing the ruling BJP of a cover up last week. Opposition leader Siddaramaiah told the media that two influential politicians were involved and there was an attempt to cover up their role in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnatakaprime-accused-in-bitcoin-case-held-on-drug-charges-101636398722016.html
09-11-2021||India||Mahakumbh fake Covid testing accused arrested from Noida residence||The main accused in the Mahakumbh fake Covid tests case, Sharat Pant and his wife Mallika Pant were arrested from their Noida residence late on Sunday. The couple, absconding for months, arrived at their home late on Sunday night.The arrest, by the Special Investigation Team investigating the fraud comes six months after it registered a case in the matter.The two are partners in Max Corporate Services, which had the contract for Covid-19 testing of pilgrims, tourists and local residents during the Mahakumbh held earlier this year.According to deputy Inspector General of Police Yogendra Singh Rawat ,who also holds the charge of Senior Superintendent of Haridwar ,SIT and Special Operation Group (SOG), the police received vital information regarding location and movement of Sharad and Mallika Pant in Noida.“On the intervening night of November 7 and November 8 both the accused had arrived at their residence B-56,Sector 48 in Noida to take some belongings but prior information led to them being nabbed by the investigating team. They have been arrested and the police is interrogating them for further revelations and details about other accomplices involved in the fake testing case,” Rawat said during a press conference in Haridwar on Monday afternoon.The Mahakumbh fake Covid testing fraud surfaced in June after a Faridkot resident complained to the authorities that he received a message to collect his Covid-19 report despite never having been tested. The complaint triggered a probe into nearly 100,000 tests conducted in Haridwar during the Kumbh.On June 17, Haridwar police booked Max Corporate Services, and two private labs, Nalva Lab from Hissar and Lalchandani Lab from Delhi, in connection with the fake COVID testing caseOn June 18, Haridwar police formed a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to assist the investigation.The four- month Kumbh Mela was curtailed this year to one month (April 1-30) but devotees thronged Haridwar for months despite experts warning that saying the crowds could spark a surge in infections. Roughly 9.1 million pilgrims took the holy dip in the Ganga from January 14 to April 27, including at least six million people in April, coinciding with the second wave of the pandemic. The Mahakumbh coincided with a major spike in the COVID cases in Uttarakhand. The spike was blamed influx of millions of people from across the country to Haridwar, where testing remained low despite a direction from the Uttarakhand high court direction. Between April 1 and April 30, overall active cases in the state registered a spike of 2392 %.SIT’s investigation officer Narendra Kathait said that the couple has been booked under IPC sections 188, 269, 270,420,467,468,471 and 120 (B) and relevant sections of Disaster Management Act.This is the second arrest made by SIT in the case; in July, it arrested the owner of LOCATION’s Delphia laboratory Ashish Vashisth.Rawat said that with the arret of the Pants, SIT has made a major breakthrough in the case.The Mahakumbh is held every 12 years between Makar Sankranti, which usually falls on the second weekend of January, and Chaitra Poornima, which is celebrated in the last week of April.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mahakumbh-fake-covid-testing-accused-arrested-from-noida-residence-101636397341376.html

India has signed contracts and cleared projects worth almost ₹62,000 crore in less than two months to boost military capability with locally produced weapons and systems including transport planes, tanks, helicopters, airborne early warning systems and counter-drone weapons.The army chief enumerated steps taken by the government for promoting self-reliance, including increasing foreign direct investment (FDI) from 49% to 74%, notifying two lists of 209 weapons/equipment that cannot be imported and creating a separate budget for buying locally made military hardware.“These reforms will have a significant impact in times to come. We are privileged to be the agents of this change that has the potential to redefine India as a global hub for manufacturing defence equipment,” Naravane said.Enabling policy measures, swift decision-making and accelerating process timelines have induced new confidence in the success of ‘Make’ projects, he said.‘Make’ is a category of capital acquisition in the Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP), and the cornerstone of the Make in India initiative that seeks to build indigenous capabilities through the involvement of both public and private sector.‘Make-I’ refers to government-funded projects while ‘Make-II’ covers industry-funded programmes.Another subcategory under ‘Make’ is ‘Make-III’ that covers military hardware that may not be designed and developed indigenously, but can be manufactured in the country for import substitution, and Indian firms may manufacture these in collaboration with foreign partners.“Make-II is undoubtedly going to remain the preferred mode of acquisition for us. The Indian Army is participating in 36 ‘Make’ projects, including 15 projects which are suo motu proposals from the industry,” Naravane said.He released a list of ‘Make’ projects that the industry can participate in. These projects include surveillance and armed drone swarm, counter-drone systems, low-level light radar for surveillance along eastern and northern borders with China, infantry weapon training simulator, robotic surveillance platforms, portable helipads and a variety of ammunition.“We have to cut down our weapons import bill and eventually tap the export market. The Make in India campaign seeks to take us in that direction,” said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General BS Jaswal (retd).On October 15, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said one of the country’s key goals under the Atmanirbhar Bharat campaign was to emerge as one of the most powerful militaries and develop a modern defence industry in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indigenous-tech-key-to-winning-wars-says-army-chief-gen-naravane-101636397221479.html
09-11-2021||India||Army looks at threat detection radar along LAC||The Indian Army has sought to equip itself with a modern low level lightweight radar (LLLWR) for threat detection and response along the China border where surveillance is restricted due to mountainous terrain, officials said on Monday. The terrain provides easy ingress to enemy aircraft, helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) flying at low altitudes, they said.The radar figures on a new list of Make in India projects that the army plans to pursue in partnership with the industry. The list, released by army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane on Monday, includes surveillance and armed drone swarm, counter-drone systems, infantry weapons training simulator, robotics surveillance platforms, portable helipads, and a variety of ammunition.The army wants a 3D active electronically scanned array radar that has a range of 50km with tactical control of air defence weapons. To boost self-reliance, the government has notified two lists of 209 defence items that cannot be imported in bans that will be progressively enforced from 2021 to 2025. LLLWR is among the weapons and systems that cannot be imported.The radar is required for the northern and eastern borders with China, whose army has ramped up military activities in both sectors. India and China have been locked in a border row in Ladakh for more than 18 months, and ongoing military talks to resolve tensions have not resulted in a major breakthrough.The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has also developed an LLLWR named Aslesha Mk I for ground-based surveillance in high-altitude plains and mountains to detect and track airborne targets.The Indian Air Force has inducted the Aslesha radar but the army chose not to order it as its requirements were different, the officials said.There is an urgent need of LLLWR to plug a critical vulnerability along the China border, the officials said.The army has just inducted the upgraded L-70 anti-aircraft gun, a legacy weapon manufactured by Swedish arms firm Bofors AB, into the eastern sector to tackle aerial threats. This is the first time the upgraded L-70 gun has been positioned at high altitude. The upgraded L-70 guns, with a range of 3.5km, are capable of shooting down aircraft, armed helicopters and UAVs.India and China have hardened their positions on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh, going by increased military activities on both sides of the boundary, infrastructure development, surveillance and combat manoeuvres by their armies in the midst of the ongoing border standoff, as reported by HT on Monday.Despite two rounds of disengagement at friction points on LAC this year, the two armies still have 50,000 to 60,000 troops each and advanced weaponry deployed in the Ladakh theatre. In a report released last week, the US defence department said Beijing was taking “incremental and tactical actions to press its claims” at LAC, despite participating in talks to resolve the crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-looks-at-threat-detection-radar-along-lac-101636397160762.html
09-11-2021||India||Winter session of Parliament likely to begin from November 29||New Delhi: The winter session of Parliament to be held from November 29 to December 23 is set for another major tussle between the Opposition and the government over a host of issues including farmers’ issues, and the latest developments related to the Agusta Westland deal. The Cabinet Committee on Parliament Affairs headed by defence minister Rajnath Singh has recommended the schedule for the winter session of Parliament, officials said on Monday. The month-long session will be crucial after the near washout of the monsoon session that was slated to be the first full session after Covid pandemic hit the Indian shores. The upcoming session too, will adhere to Covid protocols and other health guidelines, said officials. MPs will be encouraged to take their vaccines and in unvaccinated lawmakers or officials would have to undergo a mandatory RTCPR test, added officials. But the political significance of the upcoming session would be huge as both the government and the Opposition would be busy pushing their agenda. Two top Opposition leaders added that the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, in which eight people died in violence after a car hit protesting farmers, would be a key issue ahead of the elections in UP, Punjab and Uttarakhand due in March next year. The latest developments related to the Agusta Westland deal and the Union government’s lifting of the ban on the Italian firm that was involved in the controversial chopper deal, Leonardo SpA, will also be raised. The government will be looking to pass several bills including the data protection bill, the Assisted Reproductive Technology bill and two key financial bills such as amendments to the PFRDA act to allow separation of NPS from pension fund.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/winter-session-of-parliament-likely-to-begin-from-november-29-101636396981311.html
09-11-2021||India||Zydus jab cleared for kids to cost govt ₹265||The Centre has placed an order for 10 million doses of ZyCov-D, Zydus Healthcare’s anti-coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccine, at ₹265 per dose (or ₹795 for the recommended three-dose regimen), according to people familiar with the matter, paving the way for India’s first Covid-19 vaccine for children between the ages 12 and 18 years that will soon be introduced into the national immunisation programme. There was no announcement on a likely date for the launch of vaccinations for children in this age group.Additionally, ₹93 per dose will be charged as the cost of the needle-free intradermal applicator that is required to administer the shot.The price ( ₹1,074 in all) is a significant reduction from the ₹1,900 the company initially quoted for the regimen of the indigenously-developed Covid-19 vaccine that is the world’s first plasmid DNA-based one.The two other vaccines that are currently part of the government’s programme are priced at ₹225 a dose (for the two-dose Covaxin one) and ₹215 a dose (for the two-dose Covishield one).“The Centre has placed an order for about 10 million doses. After hard bargaining by the government, the company agreed to bring down the cost. It is just a matter of time before this particular vaccine is used under the public immunisation programme,” said a person aware of the matter, on condition of anonymity.It took months for both the parties to fix a price for each dose of the vaccine that was approved for emergency use on August 20. The company confirmed the development.“…received an order to supply one crore (10 million) doses of ZyCoV-D, the world’s first Plasmid DNA Vaccine, to the Government of India at ₹265 per dose and the needle-free applicator being offered at ₹93 per dose, excluding GST. The pricing has been decided in consultation with the Government of India,” said the company in a statement on Monday.Sharvil Patel, managing director of the company, said, “We are happy to support the Government’s vaccination programme with ZyCoV-D. The needle- free application of the vaccination, we hope, will motivate many more to vaccinate and safeguard themselves from COVID-19, especially children and young adults in the age group of 12 to 18 years.”Till Monday night, India has fully vaccinated 348million people and partly vaccinated another 393 million. That works out to 78.8% of the adult population of 940 million that is currently eligible for Covid vaccines.The vaccine works by instructing cells to produce the spike protein of the Sars-CoV-2 virus, which elicits an immune response. Results from the company’s phase 3 clinical trials showed the vaccine has an efficacy of 66.6%.“Since this vaccine is administered differently using a needle-free applicator, vaccinators are being trained to give the shot,” said an official in the government aware of the matter, requesting anonymity.The vaccine is to be given on Day zero, Day 28 and Day 56, as per the schedule shared by the company.“ZyCoV-D has shown good stability at temperatures of around 25 degrees for at least three months. The thermostability of the vaccine will help in easy transportation and storage of the vaccine without any problems of fluctuations in temperature. For prolonged use, a temperature of 2-8 degrees is sufficient. Also being a DNA plasmid vaccine, ZyCoV-D doesn’t have any problem associated with vector based immunity. The DNA Plasmid platform allows generating new construct quickly to deal with mutations in the virus,” the company’s statement said.ZyCoV-D was developed in partnership with the government’s Department of Biotechnology under Mission Covid Suraksha, which involved the pooling of resources by several Indian research institutions for development and clinical trials.There are two vaccine candidates that have been tested among children in India; apart from the Zydus vaccine, subject expert committee of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation also recommended use of Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin for use in children between 2 and 18 years recently.The National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation is working on the protocol and framework for the inclusion of this vaccine in the programme as the vaccination in children is likely going to be introduced in phases with those at high risk (children with comorbidities) being given priority.Government experts are at present working on a list of comorbidities.“They will have to do it in a phased manner as if you look at the numbers there should be about 400 million children, and 1-2% of them likely to be at higher risk because of their medical condition and the kind of treatment they would be taking such as chemo, transplant medication, etc. It will be a huge challenge logistically; therefore, doing it in phases makes sense,” said Dr Anupam Sibal, senior paediatrician and group medical director, Apollo Hospitals. The 400 million number includes children in the 2-18 year age group.Globally, at least 50 countries have begun giving doses to children. In most cases, children above the age of 12 are being inoculated. The shots being used for these ages are typically the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/zydus-jab-cleared-for-kids-to-cost-govt-265-101636396924109.html
09-11-2021||India||Accused in Lakhimpur case being favoured: SC||The investigation into the Lakhimpur Kheri incident appears to be favouring the “main accused” in the case, the Supreme Court said on Monday, pushing for the appointment of a retired high court judge from outside Uttar Pradesh to oversee the probe and “infuse fairness, independence and faith” into it.Monday’s comments by the apex court continue the trend of its criticism of the way the state has handled the investigation in the case where a convoy, in which at least one vehicle belonged to a Union minister, ran over farmers protesting three controversial laws, leading them to run amok and lynch some of the occupants of the vehicles. Eight people died in that incident on October 3 -- four farmers, three Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers, and a journalist, who, the state said on Monday, was also killed when a vehicle ran over him, not lynched by farmers as originally claimed in some quarters.Ashish Mishra, the son of the minister, is one of the accused in one of the two cases (the convoy running over farmers) being investigated. His arrest came only after the court criticised, on October 9, the kid-gloves treatment he seemed to be receiving from the police.“We are very sorry to say this but prima facie, it appears that one particular accused is sought to be given benefit by overlapping the two FIRs in the case...evidence is collected...in a way to protect the main accused,” remarked a bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana, while hearing the case registered by the top court on its own motion (suo motu) .The other case being investigated by the police has to do with the lynchings of some of the occupants of vehicles in the convoy, and the court was perturbed that some of the evidence being collected in this case was aimed at protecting the “main accused”.The court did not name Mishra, the son of the junior Union minister of home affairs Ajay Mishra ‘Teni’.To be sure, on Monday, the state said it has “clinching evidence” of Mishra’s presence at the scene (something he and his father have consistently denied), but that forensic reports on this are awaited.The bench, which included justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli, underscored the need for appointing a retired high court judge from outside the state to monitor the probe after finding out that the investigation in the farmers’ murder case (FIR no 219) could be adversely impacted by the manner in which the UP Police were recording evidence in the case relating to the murder of three BJP workers (FIR no 220) .It added that the court does not have confidence in the judicial commission appointed by the UP government. On October 7, the UP government set up a judicial commission, headed by retired Allahabad high court judge PK Srivastava, to probe the incident.The court’s views on having a former high court judge to independently oversee the probe and ward off any mix-up of evidence were fortified by the revelation that local journalist Raman Kashyap was not murdered by the protesting farmers, as widely perceived, but run over by the offending vehicle that fatally knocked down the four farmers.On his part, senior counsel Harish Salve, appearing for the UP government, told the bench that the police have “clinching evidence” in the form of videos and call detail records (CDRs) to show the presence of Ashish Mishra on the spot, and that forensic reports were awaited.Commenting on the delay in getting the reports from the forensic science laboratory (on the video clips of the incident) and also on non-seizure of mobile phones of all the accused, the bench said: “We gave you 10 days after the last date but nothing has been done. This is not going the way we wanted it to.”The police have identified a total of 16 accused in the case. While Mishra and 12 others were arrested over the past few weeks, the three others are the three BJP workers lynched in the aftermath.On Monday, when the Supreme Court took up the latest status report submitted by the UP government in a sealed envelope, it pointed out certain statements recorded by the police during the course of the investigation into the death of the three BJP workers. The bench noted that at least 50 witnesses in the BJP workers’ murder case (FIR no 220), in their statements to the police, sought to exonerate the “main accused” in the farmers’ murder case (FIR no 219).“We are very sorry to say this but prima facie, it appears that one particular accused is sought to be given benefit by overlapping the two FIRs. Now, it is being said that there are two FIRs and the evidence collected in one FIR will be used in another. Evidence in the FIR no 220 is being collected in a way to protect the main accused. You can very well understand the fate of the case in such a scenario,” the bench pointed out to Salve.The senior lawyer replied that it was after the Supreme Court’s direction on October 26 that the police started recording statements of witnesses in the second FIR relating to BJP workers’ death.“Some of these witnesses started giving exculpatory statements against the accused in the other FIR. There are a lot of people who are trying to exculpate the accused in the farmers’ case. They appear for their statements in FIR no 220 but start giving evidence about FIR no 219. The police also have this problem but they will have to record statements of everyone,” Salve argued.The bench, however, observed that the two FIRs should be investigated separately.“What appears to us is that this SIT (special investigation team) is unable to maintain an investigative distance between the different FIRs. They are not bound to record the statements of whosoever is coming forward. The witnesses must have something substantial to say. Otherwise, it will become oral evidence in one case versus oral evidence in another case,” said the bench.It added: “To ensure that there is no mix-up of evidence in the case, we are inclined to appoint a former judge of a different high court to monitor this probe. We are not confident about your state judicial commission to oversee it. Let a former judge monitor everything till the charge sheet is filed.”The bench proposed the names of justices Ranjit Singh and Rakesh Kumar, both retired judges of the Punjab & Haryana high court, asking Salve to come back with instructions on Friday about the state’s preference of a judge when the matter is next heard.The bench emphasised that there were three sets of murders in the case -- of the four farmers; three political workers; and a journalist. “Each one should be investigated independently and taken to a logical conclusion,” it added.At this, Salve said that the investigations have now disclosed that the journalist was also crushed by the offending vehicle. “He was earlier thought to be with Ashish Mishra but then it was seen that he was also crushed by the car with the farmers. His case has now been transferred to the FIR on the farmers’ death,” the lawyer said.The disclosure prompted the bench to remark: “This is why we are saying let a former high court judge oversee the investigation... that is why monitoring is required. The cause of death (of the journalist) was earlier being shown as something entirely different. The impression given to us was that the journalist was also in the car,” the bench told Salve, who replied that there are political overtones to this case.The bench retorted: “We don’t want to add to any political overtone or any other tone. We don’t want to monitor each and everything. Let a retired high court judge look at everything till the chargesheet is filed. This is the only solution.”At this point, senior advocate Arun Bhardwaj registered a complaint on behalf of the widow of BJP worker Shyam Sunder Nishad, who was among the three lynched allegedly by the furious crowd .Bhardwaj showed a picture to claim that Nishad was initially in the custody of the policemen but was later lynched by the mob. The lawyer said that Nishad’s family has lost faith in the state police and wants the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to take over the investigation into Nishad’s death.But the bench replied: “We are not giving it to the CBI. CBI is not the solution to everything. We want a retired high court judge to monitor the probe and filing of separate charge sheets. We want to protect the evidence collected.”On October 26, the UP government informed the Supreme Court that all the 16 accused, including the three BJP workers who were later allegedly lynched, have been identified by eyewitnesses in the case. The state did not name any accused though.On October 20, the bench asked the UP Police to pull up its socks and record witnesses’ statements before a judicial magistrate under Section 164 as quickly as possible to dispel the impression that the state is “dragging its feet”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/accused-in-lakhimpur-case-being-favoured-sc-101636396920752.html
09-11-2021||India||Maharashtra: PM Modi lays foundation stone for key road projects||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday laid the foundation stone for two road projects aimed at improving connectivity to the temple town of Pandharpur in Maharashtra via video conferencing. Modi said the annual Pandharpur ‘Wari’ (pilgrimage) is also the inspiration behind his call for ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas’ (everyone’s support, everyone’s development and everyone’s trust). “There is no discrimination in the pilgrimage on the lines of caste. Every pilgrim is equal and lives with the spirit of brothers and sisters. Everyone has one ‘gotra’ that is Vitthal gotra. So when I say Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas, it is inspired from the same tradition,” Modi said, after laying the foundation stone for four-laning of five sections of Shri Sant Dnyaneshawar Maharaj Palkhi Marg (NH-965) and three sections of Shri Sant Tukaram Maharaj Palkhi Marg (NH-965G) via video conferencing. Apart from the sections, the road projects will also have dedicated walkways for ‘Palkhi’ on either side, at an estimated total cost of more than ₹6690 crore and about ₹4400 crore respectively.The Wari is a pilgrimage undertaken by devotees of Lord Vitthal to his temple in Pandharpur. Palanquins (Palkhis) venerating Sant Dnyaneshwar and Sant Tukaram are carried to Pandharpur from Alandi and Dehu in Pune district by the Warkaris, who cover the 250km distance by foot. The PM said sentiments possessed by the Warkaris inspire everyone to work for the development of the nation. Commenting on the women participation in the Warkari movement, Modi said women take part in the yatra with the same zeal as men as the key feature of the tradition. “This is a reflection of the power of women in the country. ‘Pandhari ki wari’ symbolizes the equality of opportunity. Warkari movement considers discrimination inauspicious, and this is its great motto,” said the prime minister. The prime minister also said that most Warkaris come from the farmer’s community, and these sons of the soil, the ‘Dharti Putras’, have kept Indian tradition and culture alive. “A true ‘annadata’ unites the society and lives the society and lives for the society. You are the cause as well as a reflection of society’s progress”, Modi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtrapm-modi-lays-foundation-stone-for-key-road-projects-101636396863626.html
09-11-2021||India||Indian Ocean Region nations need cooperative architecture: Harsh Shringla||Countries in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) need a new cooperative architecture for their common maritime space to ensure both security and free trade, foreign secretary Harsh Shringla on Monday said.The Covid-19 pandemic and new threats have highlighted the need to work together to forge common solutions, and India is ready to do its share to tackle these issues, he said, while addressing the Goa Maritime Conclave on the theme “Maritime security and emerging non-traditional threats: A case for proactive role for IOR navies”.Defence secretary Ajay Kumar, who also addressed the event held in a hybrid format, raised the unprecedented expansion of conventional navies in the Pacific region, and said this is prompting a “new genre of arms race” whose effects are being felt far beyond the region. Though he didn’t name any country, his remarks were an apparent reference to China.Shringla noted that the prosperity and well-being of people of countries in the region are built on a foundation of law and order and security, and said: “A new cooperative architecture for our common maritime space that ensures security for its inhabitants, driven by our realities, and our aspirations to lead better lives, is necessary to grasp this opportunity.”While security in the context of foreign policy was traditionally associated with countering external security threats, countries in the region now have to contend with non-traditional and sub-conventional threats that require new solutions, he said.“We now operate on the basis of an expanded concept of human security that takes a broader view,” he said.Navies, coast guard forces, and maritime security agencies of the region need to do more together since all problems that will arise cannot be anticipated, he said. “India stands ready and willing to do its share – and more – in tackling these problems.”The IOR countries can work on strengthening structures, understandings, procedures and resources so that they can better manage problems. “It will also enable us to create a ‘surge’ capacity to deal with the unknown,” he said.The pandemic has led to a rebalancing that resulted in a dispersal of capacities, including for Indian Ocean nations. “Every one of us present here have a growing ability to come up with common solutions to common problems. That means we are able to do more together,” he said.Many of the cooperative activities are in the areas of policing and law-enforcement, and more appropriate to the “newer and rapidly evolving threat matrix”, he noted. Among the non-traditional and sub-conventional problems listed by Shringla were transnational crime syndicates engaged in human trafficking, smuggling and narcotics, irresponsible fishing that damages food security, maritime accidents that lead to pollution, and natural disasters that affect coastal economic and population centres.Coastal population centres, Shringla noted, are also “targets for terrorists, supported and encouraged by the resources of governments”.In an apparent reference to China’s aggressive maritime activities, especially in the South China Sea, he said: “Another set of challenges arises from geopolitical volatilities. A lack of commitment to settled international law has led to an increased militarisation of the region. Militarisation always adds to complexities.”Defence secretary made a special reference to illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing in international waters off India’s coast – something that Chinese boats have been accused of – and called for action against the practice.“While we talk of non-traditional threats, we cannot ignore the impact of expansion at unprecedented speed of conventional navies in the Pacific. We are also witnessing enhancement of certain maritime presence in passages in our region which do not always seem innocent,” Kumar told the gathering that included the Indian Navy chief Admiral Karambir Singh.“The negative effects of such expansion are felt beyond the Pacific. Though it is early to conclude, such expansion has triggered others to acquire traditional capabilities and thus to start a new genre of arms race,” he said.The third edition of the Goa Maritime Conclave is being held under the aegis of the Naval War College in Goa. The event was joined by senior officials of 12 Indian Ocean countries, including Bangladesh, Indonesia, Thailand, the Maldives, Myanmar, Singapore and Sri Lanka.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-ocean-region-nations-need-cooperative-architecture-harsh-shringla-101636396861972.html
09-11-2021||India||Terrorists gun down one more civilian in Kashmir||Terrorists gunned down a Kashmiri salesman in the old city area of Srinagar on Monday evening, the second targeted killing in the Jammu and Kashmir capital in the last 24 hours.Police said unidentified gunmen fired on Mohammad Ibrahim Khan in the Bohri Kadal area of Srinagar around 8pm. Khan, a resident of Bandipore, worked in the dry fruit shop of Roshan Lal Mawa, a Kashmiri Pandit businessman who returned to the Valley in 2018 and set up his business.“Terrorists fired upon one civilian identified as Mohammad Ibrahim Khan son of Ghulam Mohammad Khan resident of Astengoo Bandipora at Borikadal area of Srinagar. In this terror incident, he sustained critical gunshot injuries and was immediately shifted to nearby hospital for the treatment where he succumbed to his injuries,” said a spokesperson for the Srinagar Police.He said security forces cordoned off the area to trace the attackers.Khan’s killing was the second attack in the city in the past 24 hours. On Sunday night, militants killed 29-year-old police constable Tawseef Ahmad Wani in the Batamaloo area .Former chief minister Omar Abdullah condemned the killing. “The dastardly killing of Ibrahim is reprehensible & I unreservedly condemn it. Unfortunately Ibrahim is the latest in a series of targeted killings in the valley, especially Srinagar,” he tweeted,This is the 13th targeted killing in Kashmir since October 1, including five non-local labourers. Multiple gunfights broke out during operations by security forces to find those responsible for the attacks. Of the 11 people killed in October, seven were in Srinagar.The killing of civilians had spread panic in the Valley, especially in the city where security was bolstered. The attacks on civilians and non locals were discussed during home Minister Amit Shah’s security review meeting in October.During the four-hour meeting, Shah directed the chiefs of intelligence and investigative agencies, and security forces to make rigorous efforts to wipe out terror from the Valley, people familiar with the development said.The Resistance Front (TRF), an arm of the Lashkar-e-Taiba terror outfit, has claimed responsibility for most of the attacks.The wave of violence began on October 2, when two civilians, Majid Guroo and Mohammad Shafi, were shot dead in Srinagar.On October 5, three civilians – Makhan Lal Bindroo, a Kashmiri Pandit and well-known pharmacist in Srinagar; Virender Paswan, a street vendor from Bihar’s Bhagalpur; and Mohammad Shafi Lone, head of a taxi union in Bandipora district – were killed in terror attacks.On October 7, two teachers – Supinder Kaur, principal of the Government Boys Higher Secondary School, and Deepak Chand, a teacher at the same school in Srinagar’s Eidgah area – were shot dead by gunmen inside the school.On October 16, A street vendor from Bihar, Arvind Kumar Sah, and a carpenter from Uttar Pradesh, Sagheer Ahmad, were gunned down in Srinagar and Pulwama, respectively. On October 17, two more non-local labourers from Bihar, Raja Reshi and Joginder Reshi, were killed by terrorists in the Wanpoh area of Kulgam district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/terrorists-gun-down-one-more-civilian-in-kashmir-101636396740667.html
09-11-2021||India||UP leapfrogged 7 ranks, Gujarat tops logistics ease index||Uttar Pradesh (UP) has shown an outstanding performance in the ease of logistics this year, jumping seven slots from its previous 13th position, while Gujarat retained its top slot for the third consecutive year, Union commerce minister Piyush Goyal said on Monday, releasing the Logistics Ease Across Different States (LEADS) Report 2021.“I saw some states have leapfrogged significantly... Uttar Pradesh, for example, has leapfrogged seven ranks in just two years, from 2019 to 2021, and that is probably the highest jump any state has had,” he said, adding that the significant improvement reflects the efforts made by the UP government in improving infrastructure.Launched in 2018 by the commerce and industry ministry, the LEADS index ranks 21 states on the basis of ease of logistics parameters such as infrastructure, services, and operating and regulatory environment.The 2021 survey was conducted between May and August 2021, and the exercise garnered 3,771 responses from 1,405 respondents across the countryThe top six states in the LEADS index are Gujarat, Haryana, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh. Odisha came seventh in the latest round, followed by Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.Compared to the rankings in 2019, while Haryana jumped from the sixth position to second, Punjab slipped from the second position to third, Tamil Nadu moved up one rank to fourth, and Maharashtra lost one rank.Assam stood last among 21 states while Jammu & Kashmir was ranked first in the Northeastern states and Himalayan region, followed by Sikkim and Meghalaya. Delhi ranked first among the Union territories, while Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Jharkhand were among the states recording remarkable improvements, the report said.While launching the report, Goyal said, LEADS will encourage healthy competition among states and UTs for improvement in logistics development and help the government in bringing down the logistics cost by 5% over the next five years. According to industry secretary, Anurag Jain, estimated logistics costs in India is currently about 14%, which is quite high compared to 8-10% globally.“Rather than just absolute improvement in one state, improvement of logistics across all states will be a force multiplier for the entire logistics ecosystem,” Goyal said. States play an indispensable role in improving the logistics ecosystem of India, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-leapfrogged-7-ranks-gujarat-tops-logistics-ease-index-piyush-goyal-101636396681395.html
09-11-2021||India||‘Not a desirable situation’: SC slams states for delaying nod for CBI probes||The Supreme Court on Monday favoured suo motu (on its own motion) registration of a public interest litigation (PIL) over inordinate delay by eight states in the country, including West Bengal, Kerala, Maharashtra and Punjab, in deciding requests of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to carry out investigations in more than a hundred cases.“This is certainly not a desirable situation,” said a bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and MM Sundresh, as it came across the data submitted to the court by CBI director Subodh Kumar Jaiswal on how the investigations were yet to take off for want of a go-ahead by eight states that have withdrawn the general consent from the agency to conduct probe in their territories.The bench noted that the issue was serious, and required urgent attention in view of the CBI’s assertions that crucial evidence in economic offences of high magnitudes are getting disappeared or destroyed while the states do not respond to the agency’s requests.Expressing its views on registration of a suo motu PIL, the bench said that the matter should be placed before the Chief Justice of India (CJI) for his consideration and appropriate orders.Jaiswal on October 18 filed his personal affidavit in response to posers by the court on September 3, asking the director to place relevant data on the cases being prosecuted by the agency throughout the country; their success rate in securing conviction; and the impediments in completing investigations in a timebound manner.Jaiswal, apart from disclosing that the agency has maintained a success rate of about 65-70% in getting conviction over the last 10 years and that it intends to improve this average to 75% by August 2022, cited the agency’s predicament in completing investigation in cases where the state concerned has withdrawn the general consent, requiring CBI to obtain the state’s consent on a case-by-case basis.His affidavit stated that CBI has sent over 150 requests to the governments of Maharashtra, Punjab, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Kerala and Mizoram between 2018 and June 2021 for grant of specific consent for investigation of cases in the territory of these states but approvals were granted in less than 18% cases.Jaiswal highlighted that the cases in which the states agreed for a CBI probe chiefly related to trap of corrupt central public servants, while requests in approximately 78% cases pertaining to bank frauds of high magnitude impacting the economy of the country remained pending.“The delay caused in taking up cases by CBI due to any of the reasons mentioned above, at times, leads to destruction or dissipation of evidence. This is detrimental not only for the investigation by the CBI but also for subsequent prosecution of cases,” lamented Jaiswal.On Monday, additional solicitor general Sanjay Jain and advocate Sanjay Tyagi, appeared for CBI and referred to Jaiswal’s affidavit.Another aspect in Jaswal’s affidavit that the court highlighted in its order pertained to holding up of trials because of stay orders granted by the Supreme Court and high courts despite the top court’s directives in 2018 disapproving of an indefinite stay on trials.The statistics submitted by the CBI director showed that trials were stayed in 367 cases of 9,757 pending cases. The oldest instance of stay on trial was from the Calcutta high court, where two corruption cases remain suspended since April 1991. Similarly, in one case, the stay on the trial from the Supreme Court has been operating since August 2000.The bench said that both these aspects are important and should be placed before CJI NV Ramana for issuing appropriate orders on registration of a PIL to deal with the subject matter.The court was hearing a matter arising out of the CBI’s appeal from a 2018 judgment of the Jammu & Kashmir high court. By this judgment, the high court let off some lawyers from the charges of fabricating false evidence against a few security forces personnel to frame them in a case of rape and murder. While the two girls from Shopian due to drowning in March 2009, CBI claimed that some lawyers and doctors created false evidence of rape and murder to implicate personnel of security forces.However, it took CBI more than a year to file its appeal against this order. In January, the top court sought an explanation from the department noting the delay in filing the case “shows clearly gross incompetence in the legal department of CBI which raises serious questions of its efficacy to prosecute the case”.When the agency submitted its explanation for the delay in February, the bench called it “a saga of gross negligence in performing duties” while asking, this time, the CBI director to file his personal affidavit as to what steps are being taken to ensure proper functioning of prosecution of legal cases.Subsequently, then CBI director Rishi Kumar Shukla filed his affidavit in March 2020 apologising for the inordinate delay in filing the appeal. The director pointed out that a new set of instructions with stipulated timelines have been issued to streamline the process of filing and monitoring of appeals filed by the agency.But, in September, the bench called upon the new CBI director to submit relevant data on the agency’s success rate, observing that an analysis of CBI’s working must be done and that the “premier investigating agency” cannot simply launch prosecutions and then not bother about their outcome.On Monday, the bench also issued a notice on CBI’s petition in the case while imposing a penalty of ₹25,000 on the officers guilty of causing delay in filing the appeal before the top court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-a-desirable-situation-sc-slams-states-for-delaying-nod-for-cbi-probes-101636396502020.html
09-11-2021||India||Slugfest after French report alleges trace of Rafale deal pay-off||Mediapart, a French online journal, on Sunday published alleged fake invoices for payments between 2004-2013, that it claimed enabled French aircraft maker Dassault Aviation to pay at least €7.5 million in kickbacks to a middleman to help it secure a multi-billion deal with India for the sale of Rafale fighter jets. The Congress-led United Progressive Alliance was in power then, and the deal referred to is the original deal signed by that government with Dassault.The French publication also claimed that despite being made aware of the existence of documents to this effect in 2018, when the National Democratic Alliance was in power, Indian investigative agencies decided not to pursue the case.“It involves offshore companies, dubious contracts and ‘false’ invoices. Mediapart can reveal that detectives from India’s federal police force, the Central Bureau of Investigations (CBI), and colleagues from the Enforcement Directorate (ED), which fights money laundering, have had proof since October 2018 that Dassault paid at least €7.5 million in secret commissions to middleman Sushen Gupta,” Mediapart said in a report.Neither CBI nor ED officials responded to repeated callsfrom Hindustan Times.Reacting to Mediapart’s revelations, BJP’s Amit Malviya tweeted: “Dassault paid €14.6 Mn to intermediary Sushen Gupta over the period 2004-2013 to sell Rafale. So UPA was collecting kickbacks but couldn’t close the deal? NDA later scrapped it and got into a contract with the French Govt, which upset Rahul Gandhi no end.’’Five months ago, Mediapart reported that a French judge was appointed to head a probe into suspected “corruption and favouritism” in the deal. In a report in April, the online journal claimed that it was in possession of documents that showed Dassault and its industrial partner Thales, a defence electronics firm, paid “middleman” Gupta several million euros in “secret commissions” in connection with the deal.HT could not reach Gupta for a response.According to the April report, the bulk of the payments were made during the UPA regime. “According to an accounts spreadsheet belonging to Sushen Gupta, an entity called simply ‘D’, which is a code he regularly used to designate Dassault, paid €14.6 million to Interdev in Singapore over the period 2004-2013,” the report said.It said Interdev was a shell company with no real activity and administered by a straw man for the Gupta family.The report said according to another accounts spreadsheet belonging to Gupta, which only covers the years 2004 to 2008, Thales paid €2.4 million to another shell company.In another report in April, Mediapart claimed that Dassault paid €1 million to Gupta for manufacturing 50 large replica models of Rafale jets, even though the planemaker provided inspectors of French anti-corruption agency Agence Française Anticorruption no proof that these models were made.India’s decision to sign an $8.7 billion government-to-government deal with France to buy 36 Rafale warplanes made by Dassault was announced in April 2015, with an agreement signed a little over a year later. This replaced the previous Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government’s decision to buy 126 Rafale aircraft, 108 of which were to be made in India by the state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL).The deal became controversial. The Opposition, led by the Congress, claimed that the price at which India was buying Rafale aircraft was ₹1,670 crores for each, three times the initial bid of ₹526 crores by the company when the UPA was trying to buy the aircraft. It also claimed the previous deal included a technology transfer agreement with HAL.The UPA deal, struck in 2012, was not a viable one, the then defence minister Manohar Parrikar maintained, implying that it would have never been closed and that, therefore, any comparison was moot. The UPA was not able to close the deal till 2014, largely over discussions related to the pricing of items not included in the initial bid.The government has said that it cannot disclose the details of the price because of a confidentiality agreement with France, and the strategic reason of not showing its hand to India’s enemies. It said that the current deal also includes customised weaponry.The Supreme Court heard a public interest case on the deal and in November 2019, said it saw nothing wrong in it. In a February 2019 report, the government’s auditor, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, said India had not overpaid for the jets.HT has not reviewed any of the documents cited by Mediapart.Interestingly, in a press conference on Monday, the Congress focused on the government’s inability to stop operations by middlemen like Gupta, who was also involved also in the Agusta Westland deal for VVIP choppers. Gupta was investigated by Indian agencies over his role in the AgustaWestland VVIP chopper scam, also during the UPA’s rule.ED and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) are probing allegations of money laundering in the 2007 contract for the purchase of 12 luxury VIP helicopters for use by top political leaders, including the President, the Prime Minister, and former PMs. The deal was cancelled in early 2014 over allegations of wrongdoing.The opposition party demanded to know the “deal” between the NDA government and Augusta or Finmecania (the former is a unit of the latter) after news reports said the Centre has lifted its 2014 ban on an Italian company Leonardo SpA (the new name of Finmeccanica ).Government’s information officer refused to comment on the matter.Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said, “Is it now ok to deal with a company that Modi ji & his Govt called “corrupt-bribe giver-bogus”? Does it mean that fake bogey of corruption is being given a quite burial? Nation awaits answers!”Congress Party spokesperson Gourav Vallabh said that after “mysteriously withdrawing blacklisting of Augusta Westland/Finmecanica on July 22, 2014” the government has now “lifted procurement ban from it.”The AgustaWestland scam pertains to irregularities in the purchase of 12 VVIP choppers by IAF from Anglo-Italian firm, which came to light in 2012. It is alleged that government officials involved in procurement of choppers agreed to change the mandatory service ceiling from 6000 meters to 4500 meters for the VVIP choppers, which ultimately benefitted Anglo-Italian firm AgustaWestland.According to CBI, it has established “money trail” of 62 million Euros (around 415 crore) out of suspected 67 million euros ( ₹452 crore) total bribe paid to Indian officials through middlemen. The irregularities in the award of contract to AgustaWestland led to estimated loss of 398.21 million euros (around ₹2,666 crore) to the Indian government in the 556.262 million euros ( ₹3726.9 crore) contract, according to CBI.ED arrested Kamal Nath’s nephew Ratul Puri in September 2019 for allegedly using his companies to launder the bribe money in the scandal. A charge sheet was filed against him in November 2019 in which it was stated by the ED that Ratul Puri received proceeds of crime amounting to Euro 704,134.57 and $150,000 from Interstellar Technologies Limited in his foreign entities. The same were thereafter layered through various companies in foreign jurisdictions and then brought into India and invested in Hindustan Power Group whose Chairman is Ratul Puri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/slugfest-after-french-report-alleges-trace-of-rafale-deal-payoff-101636396441666.html
09-11-2021||India||Contextualising the debate on central and state taxes on petrol and diesel||On November 3, the union government announced a cut in special excise duty on petrol and diesel by ₹5 and ₹10 respectively. The announcement also urged states to do the same . “States are also urged to commensurately reduce VAT (value added tax) on petrol and diesel to give relief to consumers” a press release from the union finance ministry said. Another release, issued by the ministry of petroleum on November 5, listed 14 states and union territories which had not reduced their VAT on petrol and diesel. Almost all of these states are ruled by non-NDA parties. Are these states not cooperating with the centre in bringing down inflation?There is a difference between central and state taxes on fuelCentral taxes on petrol and diesel are split into multiple components. While some of these taxes are ad valorem – tax imposed as a share of price of the commodity -- in nature, some of them are fixed. While state taxes are also a mix of ad valorem and fixed, the latter is a much smaller share than the former when compared to the taxes levied by the centre. Data from the ministry of petroleum shows this clearly. In many states, the ad valorem taxes have an upper limit, which means that even when prices increase beyond a point, taxes do not increase.The ad-valorem component of state taxes has come down with a cut in central dutiesState taxes are levied on the price which is inclusive of central duties and dealers’ commission. This means that a cut in central duties automatically lowers the tax burden on account of state taxes as well. Ashok Gehlot, the chief minister of Rajasthan, made this point in a tweet on November 4.This can be seen clearly from the price build up data for petrol and diesel which is available for Delhi. A litre of petrol in Delhi on 16 October included ₹32.9 as central excise duty and the state tax (VAT) on it was 24.34.After the cut in excise duty to 27.9 on 4 November, the VAT component has fallen to 23.99. Similarly, a litre of diesel included ₹31.8 as excise duty on 16th October which resulted in VAT of 13.8.This amount has reduced to ₹12.7 after central excise duty was cut by ₹10. This is why the price of petrol and diesel has fallen by more than ₹5 and ₹10 per litre in the four metro cities.States have seen a decline in their share in petroleum revenues over timeIndia’s constitutional framework calls for a formula based – it is decided by the Finance Commission every five years – distribution of revenues between the centre and states. The latest award, which was decided by the 15th Finance Commission, put the share of states at 41%. However, special duties and cesses collected by the centre do not come under the divisible pool which is governed by the finance commission’s awards. With the centre shifting a bigger share of petrol-diesel taxes under the special duty/cess heads, states have seen a fall in their share in taxes collected from sale of petroleum products in the country. This share was the lowest since 2014-15 in 2020-21, when the states faced the biggest fiscal squeeze on account of pandemic related spending. The share has improved in the first quarter of 2020-21, perhaps on account of higher prices leading to higher tax collection on ad valorem state taxes.Debate on petrol-diesel taxes is just one aspect of the crisis in fiscal federalismIndia’s fiscal federalism framework is in a deep crisis and this predates the pandemic’s disruption to the economy.Its reform-quotient notwithstanding, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) has played an important role in this. To get the states to agree to GST, the centre agreed to provide 14% guaranteed growth in the base revenue of the states for five years following the roll-out of GST. The promise has run into both short-term and long-term difficulties. The centre has not been able to collect adequate compensation through the compensation cess and has had to facilitate state borrowing in collaboration with RBI. Repayment of this borrowed amount will be made by extending the period of the compensation cess. Even after this mess is sorted, a lot of states might see a reduction in their revenue collections when the centre stops its guaranteed compensation programme.Then there is the fear among states that the centre is violating the spirit of finance commission awards by shifting more of its taxes outside the divisible pool. But what is also true is the fact that the political calculations have led to the centre taking greater spending responsibilities in areas where the states should have played a bigger role. Schemes such as PM-KISAN etc. – agriculture is state subject in the constitution – are the biggest example of this. N K Singh, the chairperson of the 15th Finance Commission echoed these concerns in a HT interview published on February 5, 2021 when he admitted that he thinks the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution (the part which divides domains into central, states and joint Centre-states jurisdiction) has outlived its purpose. “The Seventh Schedule decided to classify between the three categories... what would be in the exclusive category of the Union, exclusive domain of the states, and what would be in the concurrent list. There was a degree of clarity in that. Over a period of time, you have really transgressed from one end to the other. Most of the centrally sponsored schemes are subjects which are classic subjects in the domain of the states, such as employment, food, education,” he said then.This is a trend which is likely to continue, as delivery of centralised welfare benefits is one of the biggest electoral planks of the Bharatiya Janata Party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/contextualising-the-debate-on-central-and-state-taxes-on-petrol-and-diesel-101636390921086.html
09-11-2021||India||HT THIS DAY: November 9, 2016 — The black buck stops here, says PM Modi||New Delhi- Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on Tuesday the abolition of 1000 and 500 rupees bank notes from midnight, a dramatic move aimed at stamping out corruption and draining illicit cash from the economy.In a surprise late-evening televised address to the nation, Modi said the notes in circulation can be exchanged at banks till December 30. Some concessions will be allowed for use of these notes at hospitals and crematoriums, and to buy air, rail and bus tickets till November 11.There will be some restriction on withdrawal of cash from banks and ATMs.The move could help bring billions of dollars-worth of unaccounted for cash back into the economy, and choke the flow of fake high-value banknotes militant groups use to fund their attacks against India.The decision is also an attempt by Modi to fulfill his election promise of curbing tax evasion and recovering illegally stashed incomes overseas. It gives his Bharatiya Janata Party a talking point ahead of elections in five states next year.But the move entails possible downside risks. Given that about 40% of India’s economy is driven by small- and medium-sized enterprises that largely run on cash transactions, the decision could have a knock-on effect on economic growth.The short notice too sparked concern among people, and large queues were reported outside ATMs across India, as people rushed to withdraw smaller bank notes. The move could also inconvenience poorer people and families planning weddings, the season for which starts in days.It wasn’t immediately clear how businesses and private banks with large stocks of high-value notes will deal with the transition. The banned denominations account for more than 80% of all currency in circulation by value.“Banks will be closed tomorrow. It will cause some hardship to you… Let us ignore these hardship… In a country’s history there come some moments when every person feels he too should be a part of it,” the prime minister said in a 4-minute speech.“We have an opportunity when every citizen can join this mega mission,” he added, calling the move an “Imandari ka Utsav”, or celebration of honesty.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will issue a new R2000 and R500 notes later.Modi also dwelled on the scourge of fake bank notes, saying militants operating against India were using counterfeit of the 500 rupee note, worth about $7.50 at current exchange rates.“Terrorism is a frightening thing ... But have you ever thought about how these terrorists get their money? Enemies from across the border have run their operations using fake currency notes,” he said, referring to a euphemism many Indian leaders use to describe Pakistan.This is the first time since 1978 that India has “de-monetised” its larger bank notes. Prime Minister Morarji Desai too had banned all notes above R100 to fight corruption, which Modi on Tuesday described as “a disease” that impedes the fight against poverty.India has struggled to curb corruption and slush funds in the economy, or “black money”, especially in the real estate sector. The country was ranked 76th among 168 countries in Transparency International’s 2015 index on corruption, which is estimated to cost the country 1-2% of gross domestic product every year.Modi said there was a proposal for new notes of 5000 and 10,000 denominations, but it was not accepted by the RBI. Tuesday’s announcement comes just over a month after the government raised nearly $10 billion through a tax amnesty for Indians to declare hidden income and assets. Modi had then said that no one should blame him for taking tough decisions on black money after September 30 when the amnesty scheme ended.Some officials and experts said Tuesday’s move was the biggest in decades aimed at fighting graft. BJP president Amit Shah tweeted, “This decision of PM @narendramodi is a surgical strike on menace of corruption and black money.”The Congress maintained it will support government in its effort to curb “black money” but expressed concern at the hardships it could cause farmers and families in the wedding season.Party chief spokesman Randeep Singh Surjewala also questioned the logic of introducing 2000-rupee notes in curbing corruption.President Pranab Mukherjee also welcomed “the bold step” and called upon people not to panic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htthisday-november-8-2016-the-black-buck-stops-here-says-pm-narendra-modi-abolishes-1000-and-500-bank-notes-101636385528192.html
09-11-2021||India||Army chief says local technology is a must to win future wars||Rooting for increased self-reliance in the defence sector, Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane on Monday said only indigenous technologies will be available to the military for full exploitation during conflicts and war-like situations.“Developing indigenous capabilities to confront emerging security challenges and reducing our dependence on borrowed technologies is imperative,” Naravane said at a seminar organised jointly by the defence ministry and the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI). He said the industry’s enthusiastic participation in the government’s Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India) campaign reaffirmed the country’s collective resolve to fight and win future wars with indigenous weapons and equipment.He said the army was undergoing rapid modernisation and increasingly looking at indigenous solutions for its operational needs. “India has an expanding industrial base and we are confident that most of our core requirements can be realised in-house.”Naravane’s comments come at a time when the government is encouraging self-reliance in the defence manufacturing sector through a slew of policy decisions. India has signed contracts and cleared projects worth almost ₹62,000 crore in less than two months to boost military capability with locally produced weapons and systems including transport planes, tanks, helicopters, airborne early warning systems and counter-drone weapons.The army chief enumerated steps taken by the government for promoting self-reliance, including increasing foreign direct investment (FDI) from 49% to 74%, notifying two lists of 209 weapons/equipment that cannot be imported and creating a separate budget for buying locally-made military hardware.“These reforms will have a significant impact in times to come. We are privileged to be the agents of this change that has the potential to redefine India as a global hub for manufacturing defence equipment,” Naravane said.Enabling policy measures, swift decision making and accelerating process timelines have induced new confidence in the success of ‘Make’ projects, he said.‘Make’ is a category of capital acquisition in the Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP) and the cornerstone of the Make in India initiative that seeks to build indigenous capabilities through the involvement of both the public and private sectors.‘Make-I’ refers to government-funded projects while ‘Make-II’ covers industry-funded programmes.Another sub-category is ‘Make-III’ that covers military hardware that may not be designed and developed indigenously, but can be manufactured in the country for import substitution, and Indian firms may manufacture these in collaboration with foreign partners.“Make-II is undoubtedly going to remain the preferred mode of acquisition for us. The Indian Army is participating in 36 ‘Make’ projects, including 15 projects which are suo moto proposals from the industry,” Naravane said.He released a list of ‘Make’ projects that the industry can participate in. These projects include surveillance and armed drone swarm, counter-drone systems, low-level light radar for surveillance along eastern and northern borders with China, infantry weapon training simulator, robotic surveillance platforms, portable helipads and a variety of ammunition.“We have to cut down our weapons import bill and eventually tap the export market. The Make in India campaign seeks to take us in that direction,” said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General BS Jaswal (retd).On October 15, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said one of the country’s key goals under the Atmanirbhar Bharat campaign was to emerge as one of the most powerful militaries and develop a modern defence industry in the country....||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-chief-says-local-technology-is-a-must-to-win-future-wars-101636379640316.html
09-11-2021||India||Economy, security two main pillars for India-UK cooperation in Indo-Pacific||Economy and security are set to be the two main pillars for cooperation between India and the UK in the Indo-Pacific against the backdrop of concerted efforts by the global community to counter China’s assertiveness across the region.With virtually no country capable of matching China’s deep pockets in terms of cheap financing for its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), India and the UK can come together to offer alternative sources of transparent financing for infrastructure projects and to roll out new technologies such as 5G, people familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity.In the realm of maritime security, the UK plans to have a persistent presence in the western Indian Ocean by deploying two offshore patrol vessels in the region from 2022 and a littoral defence group, based around amphibious vessels, from 2023, the people said. These deployments will be centred round the British naval base at Duqm in Oman.The UK also has a military presence at four more locations in and around the Indian Ocean – Kenya, Diego Garcia, Brunei and Singapore.Also Read: The Pakistan factor: Why India, China ties remain challenging since 1971There are also plans for more complex naval exercises and joint training to build inter-operability between the navies of the two countries. In June, the UK posted a liaison officer at the Indian Navy’s Information Fusion Centre for the Indian Ocean Region in Gurugram, a facility that tracks shipping in the region and monitors security threats.In keeping with an “Indo-Pacific tilt” in its integrated defence and foreign policy review published earlier this year, the UK is looking to work with trusted partners such as India and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) both to secure its presence in the region and to put in place security arrangements that ensure sea trade routes remain free and open.The people cited above said such maritime security arrangements are essential in view of potential flashpoints in the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea. These arrangements will also build on work done together by India and the UK in regions such as the western Indian Ocean, where the two countries have collaborated in countering piracy.The Aukus alliance forged by the US, the UK and Australia reflects the commitment of these three countries to ensure that the seas remain open and secure by providing Australia nuclear-powered submarines.Despite the negative fallout from the Aukus alliance because of Australia’s cancellation of a lucrative contract with France for conventional submarines, the people noted that there was a deep level of trust between the UK and France, which is reflected in their security, intelligence and counterterrorism cooperation.The people said the Indo-Pacific has become the focus of interest for the international community because of the dynamic growth of trade in the region. At the same time, the region has become more contested and there is a need to secure and keep open maritime trade routes, they said.Even as countries in the region work to make supply chains more diverse and resilient, India and the UK can also work together to exploit opportunities for rolling out trusted technologies in areas such as 5G, the people said.In terms of countering China’s role in infrastructure projects through the BRI, the people pointed to the potential for the UK and India to work together on the US-led Build Back Better World (B3W) initiative, including offering alternative sources of financing to Indian Ocean region countries.In this context, they noted the new India-UK Partnership on Infrastructure Policy and Financing, which will help catalyse private finance flows into India’s National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP), and the UK’s plans to invest $1.2 billion in green projects and renewable energy in India.Though there are occasional disagreements between the two sides – such as India’s concerns about the activities of pro-Khalistan elements in the UK and a recent row on Covid-19 vaccine certificates – these are outweighed by the strong cooperation in key areas such as trade and defence and the top leadership in both countries has also thrown its weight behind transforming the bilateral relationship, the people said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/economy-security-two-main-pillars-for-india-uk-cooperation-in-indopacific-101636371478046.html
