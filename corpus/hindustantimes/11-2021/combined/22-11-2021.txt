Adaptive traffic signals adjust the timing cycles to match current traffic conditions on the ground. They are constantly collecting data about approaching vehicles and creating new timing sequences to match them.This is the second time both parties have come together ignoring the Congress and the Shiv Sena. The Congress on Monday accused the NCP and the BJP of joining hands on proposals related to big budgets in Pune Municipal Corporation. NDP’s city unit president Prashant Jagtap said, “Our leader Ajit Pawar clearly instructed us not to do oppose proposals just because we are in the opposition. If any project is in the interest of the city nad citizens, we will support it.”BJP leader Ganesh Bidkar said, “It is the city’s tradition that for development projects, there is no politics. NCP came with us.”Meanwhile, the PMC on Monday okayed the appointment of a consultant for the 24x7 water project planned in 23 merged villages. The project is going on in the old city limits. Mayor Murlidhar Mohol said, “The water project is going on in the old city area and the 23 villages got merged later. It is PMC’s responsibility to provide good water supply in newly merged areas.The consultant will prepare a detailed project report (DPR) for same.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/bjp-ncp-join-hands-to-approve-adaptive-traffic-signal-project-for-pune-city-101637605790759.html
22-11-2021||Kolkata||Calcutta HC asks CBI to probe 2016 school recruitment; Bengal govt may challenge order||The Calcutta high court on Monday asked the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to conduct a preliminary inquiry into alleged irregularities in the appointment of 25 group ‘D’ employees in schools run by the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education (WBBSE). The single bench of justice Abhijit Gangopadhyay, while hearing a petition filed by some unsuccessful applicants, said on Monday that a CBI officer of the rank of deputy inspector general and a state bureaucrat of the rank of joint secretary have to complete the preliminary probe and submit a report before the court by December 21 when the next hearing will take place. The petitioners alleged that genuine applicants were deprived as ineligible people got jobs in state-run schools during the recruitment drive that started in 2016. They also alleged that the number of ineligible people recruited could be around 500 and many of them were inducted after the tenure of the panel expired. In 2016, the state approved the appointment of around 13,000 group ‘D’ staff in phases in state-run schools, said lawyers aware of the details of the case. The West Bengal School Service Commission (WBSSC) interviewed the applicants and drew up a panel of prospective employees. The validity of this panel ended in May 2019. The petitioners were heard twice last week. During the first hearing, justice Gangopadhyay pulled up the state government and warned that he would ask a Central armed police force to take control of the office of the WBSSC and tell the CBI to scrutinize all records. During the second hearing on Thursday, the WBSSC told the court through an affidavit that the 50 recruitments under the scanner were illegal as it did not clear these people. The commission also sought an inquiry by a retired judge of the Calcutta high court, indirectly implying that ineligible people were recruited by the board of secondary education. The court asked the WBBSEE to file an affidavit on Monday, said lawyers representing the state. Justice Gangopadhyay on Monday turned down the WBSSC’s suggestion to have an inquiry conducted by a retired judge. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) wasted no time and accused the Trinamool Congress (TMC) government of indulging in widespread corruption and depriving jobless youths of the state. “I appeal to all those who applied for jobs in different state departments to come forward and seek justice. This corruption is deep-rooted. Only the CBI can unearth it,” said BJP state president Sukanta Majumdar. Bengal education minister Bratya Basu was in Tripura where TMC leaders, headed by the party’s national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee, had rushed to following the arrest of TMC youth wing president Saayoni Ghosh and attack on some party workers in the run-up to the November 25 civic body polls in which the party has challenged the ruling BJP. “I do not have details of the high court order. Our government may decide to challenge it in a higher court,” Basu said in Agartala. State officials in Kolkata refused to comment. During the last hearing on November 18, justice Gangopadhyay directed the commission and the board to preserve all documents relating to the controversial appointments and stop payment of salaries to these recruits as long as the hearing is on. “Everybody who comes before this court claim they are honest and clean,” justice Gangopadhyay said on that day, slamming both the departments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/calcutta-hc-asks-cbi-to-probe-2016-school-recruitment-bengal-govt-may-challenge-order-101637605789694.html
22-11-2021||Noida||Jewar airport project ‘growth engine’ for Gautam Budh Nagar, says Yeida CEO||The upcoming Noida international airport in Jewar, which is said to be a key development project, has fuelled “big investments” and “growth” in Gautam Budh Nagar, said officials of the Yamuna Expressway industrial development authority (Yeida) on Monday.Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to lay the foundation stone for the airport project in Jewar on November 25.According to the officials, demand for industrial land for setting up businesses and land rates in nearby villages, too, have increased ahead of the opening of the airport which is set to be in use by September 2024. “Due to the progress in the Noida International Airport project in Jewar, investors are interested in the area and the region has witnessed an investment of nearly ₹18,000 crore in the past three years, thereby creating at least 200,000 jobs once these businesses become operational. The project has become a growth engine in the region along the Yamuna Expressway,” said Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer of Yeida.Despite the Covid-19 outbreak last year, there was a total investment of nearly ₹8,000 crore in 2020-21 alone... Many investors bought industrial land here to set up business along the expressway around the airport area.The Uttar Pradesh government established Yeida in 2001, to generate employment and develop urban areas along the Yamuna Expressway, which connects Greater Noida with Agra. It has 268,862 hectares of land for developmental projects, and has already acquired 12,481 hectares of it for the same. It has also fast-tracked land acquisition in view of the airport project, and the work has started with an aim to complete it in three years.So far, Yeida has 58,397 hectares notified -- identified for planned development -- in 131 villages of Gautam Budh Nagar and 40 villages of Bulandshahr. 34,291 hectares notified in Aligarh, 88,968 hectares in Hathras, 75,751 hectares in Mathura, and 11,455 hectares in Agra. It has also earmarked 1,500 acres for developmental purposes near the airport’s passenger terminal, 1,000 acres each for Film City and a logistics hub, 400 acres for Medical Device Park, 350 acres for Apparel cluster, a dedicated area for a heritage city near Mathura, and a toy city among other big-ticket projects which will see progress in the near future.“Most of the big projects, including the airport project, have just started the work on ground. Along with the progress of the airport project, other industrial projects will also see growth, thereby creating jobs and attracting more investment in this region,” CEO Singh added.Yeida has reserved ₹4,000 to ₹6,700 per square metre (sqm) as the reserve price for industrial land, ₹16,000 per sqm for residential land, and ₹7,000 per sqm for intuitional land. It, however, may soon increase the allotment rates in future as the airport project has fuelled the growth in the region already, said the officials.Meanwhile, many said that the land rates in nearby areas have also increased.“Before the airport project got a green signal, the residential land in Abadi village was available for ₹5,000 per sqm. Now, the plot rates in the village have gone up and are between ₹15,000 and ₹20,000 per sqm... Many small investors are also buying plots in villages located near the airport site,” said Ved Prakash Tripathi, a real estate consultant from Noida’s Bluecrumbs company.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/jewar-airport-project-growth-engine-for-gautam-budh-nagar-says-yeida-ceo-101637605668435.html

Some truck drivers reached Kalindi Kunj on Monday morning as they were not aware about the extension of the ban. Police deployed there asked them to take a U-turn and return, which led to the traffic jam,” he said.He also said that the Kalindi Kunj Bridge is a six-lane carriageway from Noida-Delhi and narrows down to three lanes at the end, in Kalindi Kunj. “This normally leads to a bottleneck during peak hours. Since it was Monday, many people were on their way to the office in the morning, and the movement of trucks had slowed down the traffic movement. But the stretch was cleared after 10am,” Singh added.Commuters complain of ‘massive’ traffic jamAnup Tiwari, a commuter, said that there was a “massive traffic jam” on the Noida-Delhi carriageway at the Kalindi Kunj. “Trucks were stopped on the route, and this left only two lanes for other vehicles to navigate. Commuters were stranded on the route,” he tweeted.Brajesh Kumar, a resident of Antriksh Golf View in Noida Sector 78, said that he was travelling to Delhi via the DND Flyway on Monday morning, and got stuck there in a traffic jam for 20 minutes.The traffic police, however, said that the vehicular movement on the DND Flyway was relatively smooth.On November 17, the Noida traffic police banned the entry of heavy vehicles into Delhi. “In compliance with the instructions of the Commission for Air Quality Management in Delhi-NCR (national capital region), heavy vehicles -- except those carrying essential items -- shall be strictly prohibited from entering Delhi,” the Noida traffic police had said in a statement.Now, heavy vehicles travelling from Noida via Kalindi Kunj, DND Flyway and Chilla border are guided to reach their destinations via the Peripheral Expressway and other routes.The Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) air quality index (AQI) bulletin on Monday showed that the AQI in Noida and Greater Noida were recorded at 270 and 202, respectively, which falls in the ‘poor’ category.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/traffic-jam-at-noida-delhi-kalindi-kunj-route-after-ban-on-entry-of-truck-101637605608647.html
22-11-2021||Noida||First time this month, air quality in Ghaziabad, Noida improves to ‘poor’||The air quality of Ghaziabad and Noida improved significantly on Monday, moving to the ‘poor’ category for the first time this month. Experts have attributed the improvement to the rise in wind speed. According to data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) of Ghaziabad and Noida on Monday was recorded at 254 (against 319 on Sunday) and 270 (322), respectively. The last time the Ghaziabad city experienced ‘poor’ air was on October 30 when its AQI value was recorded at 297, while Noida last witnessed ‘poor’ air on October 31 with an AQI of 292. The AQI for Ghaziabad this month remained in ‘severe’ category for a period of 10 consecutive days from November 4 to 13 while Noida suffered six consecutive days of ‘severe’ air from November 4 to 9.On Monday, Greater Noida, which has witnessed ‘poor’ air quality on several occasions this month, recorded an AQI of 202 against 298 a day earlier, showed the CPCB data. According to the CPCB, the average of AQI in 22 days of November stood at 390.95, 350.72 and 381.22 for Ghaziabad, Greater Noida and Noida, respectively.“The increase in wind speed and decrease in instances of stubble burning has improved the air quality in Noida and Ghaziabad. We are keeping control over local pollution factors. Since the wind speed has increased, the trapped pollutants in the region are dispersing fast,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UP Pollution Control Board (UPPCB). According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the present favourable wind conditions are likely to persist till November 24. “The present wind speed is about 15kmph with gusting to 25kmph. These winds are likely to be there till November 24 and will weaken thereafter. Since Diwali, we did not have any significant wind. Normally, the winds pick up during the end of November or start of December,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist, IMD. According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), stubble burning instances have reduced considerably and their contribution to Delhi’s PM2.5 is ranging below 10% since November 16. The share of stubble burning had spiked significantly to 48% on November 7 and gradually reduced thereafter.  Environmentalists said that only the meteorological conditions helped improve the air quality. “It is finally the wind speed which has helped dispersal of pollutants. It shows that enforcement and actions on ground level by different agencies failed to make impact. The pollution level is in ‘poor’ category which indicates that the air is still not better but the spell of high levels of AQI has certainly come down due to favourable wind speed,” said Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist. The Safar forecast on Monday said that the north-westerly winds are likely to continue on Tuesday and likely to further improve the air quality. “Air quality is likely to improve to ‘poor’ or lower end of ‘very poor’ category for the next two days. From November 24 onwards, local as well as transport level winds are likely to slow down resulting in slight deterioration of air quality but expected to be within the lower end of ‘very poor’ category. The effective fire count is 909 and its % share in Delhi’s PM2.5 is low,” the forecast added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/first-time-this-month-air-quality-in-ghaziabad-noida-improves-to-poor-101637605548323.html

He said the drive would be carried out on the same pattern as it was conducted during Covid 19 outbreak. “The drive would be more or less similar. However, this time the focus will be more on anti-larvae spraying and keeping a check on places vulnerable to mosquito breeding,” said Singh. The city has around 31 homes that include shelter homes, observation homes and women shelter homes. Of the total, eight establishments are being run by the government and the rest are run by private bodies. However, the officials said that the drive would cover all the shelter homes on a precautionary basis. Last year around 57 minor girls, including five pregnant girls from a shelter home in Kanpur, were tested Covid-19 positive. However, this time when the Zika virus cases are on the rise, the department seems in no mood to take any chances.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/zika-spread-women-and-child-development-dept-takes-measures-to-keep-shelter-home-inmates-safe-101637605488249.html
22-11-2021||Pune||PMC okays re-starting of NBCL-accredited Mundhwa laboratory||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has finally given clearance for its laboratory in Mundhwa to run food and water tests on Monday. The laboratory has been laying idol for the last two years, with the PMC suffering a financial loss thereof. Civic activist Vivek Velankar has been raising the issue for the for last few months. The laboratory was started by the PMC in 2011 to test food and water samples for public and government authorities and was the first to get a National Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NBCL) accreditation in 2015. An inquiry under the Right to Information (RTI) found that the laboratory was run by a private agency for five years till 2018. A renewed proposal to rent out the laboratory to private players was approved by the standing committee in 2019, but has been awaiting the general body’s approval ever since. Earlier, the PMC was paying a private agency around ₹53 lakh per annum to run the laboratory. Till 2018, the PMC paid the agency ₹3.56 crore to run the laboratory. The corporation also spent around ₹60 lakh on chemicals, electricity bills and other expenses during this period. Now the agency which operates the lab will pay the PMC.Velankar, founder of the city-based Sajag Nagrik Manch, said, “The PMC started a laboratory and provided a facility to test food and water samples for the public and government authorities. It was run by a private player till 2018. Objecting to the wastage of public money, the PMC tabled a proposal in the standing committee to rent out the laboratory to private players so that it would get ₹30 lakh per annum in revenue. The proposal was sanctioned in July 2019 in the standing committee. But, it is pending approval of the general body and the PMC is losing out on revenue since 2019. It is a waste of taxpayers’ money that was used to set up a laboratory to provide facilities to common citizens.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-okays-re-starting-of-nbcl-accredited-mundhwa-laboratory-101637605308328.html
22-11-2021||Pune||PMC auditoriums in a state of total neglect||PUNE The original audio system installed at the Anna Bhau Sathe auditorium has been replaced with duplicate equipment and CCTV cameras on the premises have been damaged, an inspection conducted by the Pune Municipal Corporation ahead of reopening the auditorium has revealed. The matter was made public at the general body meeting held on Monday when Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) corporators Subhash Jagtap and Prashant Jagtap raised the issue. The electric department on October 26 wrote a letter to the cultural department stating: “Earlier sound systems were installed in the auditorium, but all that has been stolen. Instead of that the original sound system duplicate speakers have been placed.” NCP leader Jagtap said, “The auditorium is closed. To be able to do this, the person must be an expert and it would require time to replace the equipment. This has happened hand –in-hand with the administration.” Jagtap added, “I represent the Wanowrie area. The Mahatma Phule auditorium also has been misused during the lockdown. While cleaning the auditorium, 500 empty alchohol bottles were found.” Also, during the lockdown, at least 200 chairs at the Ganesh Kala Krida Manch have been damaged. It was also revealed that the Mahatma Phule auditorium in Wanowrie has allegedly become a den for alcohol consumption. Additional municipal commissioner Kunal Khemnar promised the general body meeting that the administration will file a police case in these matters. Elected members raised the question about security guards posted round the clock at all these places and that there should be a record of persons entering the auditorium even when it is closed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-auditoriums-in-a-state-of-total-neglect-101637605068767.html

22-11-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad: Leopard is still on the loose, search operation on||The leopard, which was caught on the CCTV camera of a house in the Raj Nagar locality on November 17 and later believed to have injured two persons in Adhyatmik Nagar on November 20, is still on the loose and could not be sighted further as teams of the forest department are continuing their search. Forest officials said that they received information about sighting of the big cat near the Upper Ganga Canal on Sunday, but it could not be confirmed due to absence of pug marks. “Our teams are still searching for the leopard and the information related to canal did not materialise as pug marks of the animal could not be found so far. There was also information about presence of a leopard in Sector 23, Raj Nagar, and it was captured on a CCTV camera early Sunday morning. But the animal was probably a fishing cat as it was smaller in size. As regards to the leopard which attacked two persons in Adhyatmik, Nagar, it was a confirmed sighting and a search is on,” said Ashok Gupta, forest ranger from the divisional forest department. The officials said it is likely that the leopard sighted on November 17 in Raj Nagar and the one which attacked two persons at Adhyatmik Nagar was the same animal. “The pug marks at Raj Nagar were not found as the animal was spotted on road and cemented surfaces. But it is likely that it is the same leopard which was sighted at Adhyatmik Nagar on November 20 and probably moved on further. Our teams will continue their search,” Gupta added. The teams from Agra, Ghaziabad and Meerut, along with experts from Wildlife SOS, are searching for the leopard. “The leopard is still to be traced. As regards the information of its sighting near the canal, the pug marks of hyena, nilgai, dogs and even wild boars were found from the spot, but no pug marks of a leopard were found. It is likely that the animal moved along the railway tracks towards the canal which has dense forestry,” said an officer from Wildlife SOS. “It is an adult but whether it is a male or female is yet to be confirmed,” the officer added. In November last year when a leopard was sighted at official residence of vice chairperson of the Ghaziabad development authority, the teams of forest department conducted similar searches for over a week but the animal could not be traced.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-leopard-is-still-on-the-loose-search-operation-on-101637604949572.html

22-11-2021||Other||A day after arrest in Tripura, TMC leader Saayoni Ghosh released on bail||Actor-turned Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader Saayoni Ghosh has been granted bail from a local court of Tripura, a day after her arrest over attempt to murder, criminal conspiracy and promoting enmity between two groups, officials said.Ghosh’s arrest came after she reportedly disrupted chief minister Biplab Kumar Deb’s civic poll rally in Agartala on Saturday night by shouting ‘ Khela Hobe’ (Game On) and pelting stones at the rally.‘Khela Hobe’ is a poll slogan of Trinamool Congress during Bengal Assembly polls earlier this year.East Agartala Women police lodged a case against Ghosh under Sections 153 (promoting enmity between different groups), 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on ground of religion), 506 (criminal intimidation), 307 (attempt to murder) and 120B (criminal conspiracy).“The court didn’t find any ingredients of Sections 307 and 153A charged against Sayani Ghosh. Moreover, contradictions have been noticed in the FIR copy and the court forwarding copy. The court granted her bail on a bail bond of Rs. 20,000,” said counsel Shankar Lodh who moved for bail petition of Ghosh at the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate’s court in Agartala.Following Sayani’s arrest on Sunday, the TMC alleged that they were attacked in the premises of East Agartala Women Police Station reportedly by the BJP cadres.The BJP denied the allegation of involvement of their activists and later claimed that Trinamool Congress, CPM and Congress are in a ‘shadow alliance’ with a motto to malign Tripura.After arriving at Agartala today, Abhishek Banerjee told the reporters that they moved to the Supreme Court accusing the Tripura government of contempt of court and challenged that he would defeat Biplab Deb in the apex court. He further said that he would drag Deb to the apex court saying that his government is autocratic.Regarding Sayani Ghosh’s arrest, Banerjee said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi in West Bengal said ‘Khela Hobe’ and addressed chief minister Mamata Banerjee in an ugly way.“If Prime Minister said this, was it not criminal intimidation? But there is a basic difference between us and them and we will not follow their footsteps in this case,” he said.He alleged that his party activists were attacked in the East Agartala Women Police Station premises with the instigation of Biplab Kumar Deb.He also reacted to the BJP’s allegation of ‘shadow alliance’ of TMC with CPM and Congress, Banerjee said, “The BJP was rattled with our entry into Tripura. They are scared to death. Why didn’t they raise this allegation four months ago?”Reacting to that, Tripura Information and Cultural Affairs Minister Sushanta Chowdhury said, “They (TMC) always threaten to go to Supreme Court. And we will speak on November 28 (after vote counting of civic polls). Then, they should not say that free and fair poll was not held and they should not hide their face. I know, they will allege of unfair poll on that day too.”Naming the TMC as ‘bargi’ (dacoits), Union Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment said, “They (TMC) came here from outside to create disturbances and deteriorate law and order situation. Our culture is that of Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyaya, Rishi Aurobindo, Swami Vivekananda. Whatever we see in Bengal, is not our Bengali culture, it’s the culture of bargis. Actually, they came here to hide their failures as they lost their faces throughout the country since the Bengal Assembly polls this year. “Both the BJP and TMC appealed to the voters to exercise their franchise in the civic polls scheduled to be held on November 25.On the other hand, Tripura police lodged a case against Bengal minister Firhad Hakim for his statements where he reportedly threatened to kill five BJP supporters in Bengal for every TMC activist hurt in Tripura.Meanwhile, in order of a writ petition filed with the High Court of Tripura, a division bench of Justice SG Chattopadhyay and Subhashish Talapatra today directed Director General of Tripura Police VS Yadav and West Tripura superintendent of police to provide 24x7 security cover to CPI municipal poll candidate at ward no. 03 Rakesh Das till counting for the polls is over.Das alleged in his petition that he was assaulted by a group of goons, whom he claimed were BJP supporters, while he was campaigning on November 19. Das claimed he informed the issue to the police and sought security cover but wasn’t granted the same.In the order, the High Court said it would refrain from passing an order about free and fair conduction of the polls since the Supreme Court is in the session of the matter, but said the petitioner should be provided security personnel forthwith 24x7 till counting is over.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/a-day-after-arrest-in-tripura-tmc-leader-saayoni-ghosh-released-on-bail-101637604529842.html

Earlier in the day, Channi, along with Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee chief Navjot Singh Sidhu, handed over appointment letters to the kin of five farmers, who died during the farmer agitation. The event was held at Punjab Agricultural University. “From now onwards, you do not have to pay beyond ₹100 per connection and strict action would be taken to implement the capping of the cable price,” said Channi, addressing a political rally at the Grain Market on Gill Road, adding that the decision was meant to end ‘cable mafia’ in the state. He added that transport and cable in the state were owned and controlled by the Badal family of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD). “Illegal bus permits would be revoked and allotted to unemployed youth. Over the next days, we will also regularise the services of all safai sewaks working with municipal councils and corporations,” he claimed.CM woos auto-rickshaw driversWooing auto-rickshaw drivers, the CM held meetings with respective associations, and assured them that the fine on challans of auto rickshaw operators will be waived. Channi stated that the historic decisions have already been taken for welfare of poor, including reduction in electricity rates; waiving electricity bill arrears worth ₹1,500 crore; water bills fixed at ₹50 per month, fixed rates of sand and gravel per cusec feet at ₹5.5 besides providing free power to rural water supply schemes.Sidhu praises landmark decisions, but wants sand rate cappedFrom a stage that had major senior Congress leaders putting up a united front, Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu had both praise and criticism for the Channi government. Opening with sand prices, he said, A tractor trolley of the sand is being illegally sold for around ₹3,400 today. I will continue my battle against the sand mafia, till the rate comes down to ₹1,000.” He added that the Congress party high command must ensure that the policy on sand rates was implemented, or he would resign. He alleged that 60% of industry in the state had been shut and there was an urgent need to adopt a cluster-based approach. In his praise of the new CM’s functioning, Sidhu said landmark decision had been taken in a short span of time. “The Punjab government will soon evolve a mechanism to ensure the state was debt-free,” he said, claiming that the AAP government in Delhi was only reaping benefits of policies that the previous Congress CM Sheila Dixit had out in place. Ludhiana MP Ravneet Singh Bittu also praised Sidhu, saying that former CM Capt Amarinder Singh had an alliance with the BJP. On the occasion, some Akali workers also joined the Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cable-price-capped-at-rs-100-a-month-channi-in-ludhiana-101637604408415.html

He said this was the main reason why the top BJP leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah, were camping in the state.Lallu said these BJP leaders were not seen in the state when the people were allegedly dying to shortage of oxygen amid fight against Covid-19. He claimed that about 700 farmers had lost their lives in the agitation against three farm laws. He alleged that the state government was spending large amount of money, earned from taxes, on advertisements to make “false” claims of development.

22-11-2021||Other||Encouraged by farm laws repeal, Assam groups plan to resume anti-CAA stir||The Centre’s decision to repeal the three contentious farm laws following a year-long agitation by farmer groups have led groups opposed to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) to revive their stir seeking its withdrawal. Organisations that led the anti-CAA stir in Assam in 2019, such as the All Assam Students Union and Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (which later formed a political party called Raijor Dal), are again raking up the demand to repeal the CAA. “The Centre was forced to repeal the anti-farmer farm laws bowing down to the demand of the agitation by farming communities. This proved the government’s injustice and misjudgement. Now it’s time to repeal CAA, which is against the interest of indigenous people of Assam and northeast, soon,” tweeted AASU chief adviser Samujjal Bhattacharya after the Centre’s move on Saturday. On Sunday, former KMSS leader and present president of Raijor Dal, Akhil Gogoi also reiterated that there is a need to revive the anti-CAA stir in Assam following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement to repeal the three farm laws. “The anti-CAA stir should resume. The legislation is yet to be implemented by the Centre, but we need to remember if it does, it would pave the way for 19 million Hindus from Bangladesh to enter Assam,” Gogoi said after a meeting with Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Sunday. “While I was behind bars, some Assamese groups leading the anti-CAA stir weakened it by taking it in a wrong direction. Now that our farmers have been able to repeal the three farm laws after their agitation, it is time for all Assamese to unite and start the anti-CAA movement so that this anti-Assamese legislation is withdrawn,” he added. Gogoi, one of the prominent leaders of the anti-CAA stir in 2019, was lodged in jail for one-and-half years for his role in the agitation and two cases were lodged by National Investigation Agency against him. He became an MLA from the Sibsagar seat while he was in jail. In July this year, he was acquitted in both cases and got released from jail. The ruling BJP in Assam, which came back to power again this year, has always been very clear about its support of the legislation. It has been maintaining that the anti-CAA stir lost relevance after the Covid-19 pandemic and the party’s win in assembly polls in May this year proved that the masses were unperturbed by it. “It has now become clear to all people in Assam that the agitation against CAA was a drama. Many of those who were part of that agitation later joined BJP. People of the state are more concerned about development and not about old issues like CAA,” said former BJP MLA and president of the party’s women unit in Assam, Angoorlata Deka, on Sunday. Assam had witnessed violent protests in December 2019 against the controversial legislation that seeks to grant citizenship to religious minorities from Muslim-majority Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan who entered India on or before December 31, 2014. Five people died due to police firing in the protests and opposition to the legislation led to the birth of two regional parties, Assam Jatiya Parishad and Raijor Dal. While AJP failed to open its account in the assembly poll, Raijor Dal bagged just one seat. While protests in other parts of India against CAA were about the exclusion of Muslims from its purview, in Assam, the opposition was against allowing non-Muslim illegal immigrants to become citizens. The provision of CAA was against the Assam Accord of 1985 that assured an end to the entry of illegal immigrants irrespective of their religious affiliations. Several groups and indigenous associations felt if CAA is implemented, it could lead to an influx of illegal immigrants from Bangladesh and threaten the language, culture and land holdings of local populations. Following the deaths and violence, AASU decided to tone down the protests and finally discontinue it due to Class 10 and Class 12 board exams last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/encouraged-by-farm-laws-repeal-assam-groups-plan-to-resume-anti-caa-stir-101637602909608.html

The certificate-cum-marksheet issued to such students appearing in the examination of 2022, will bear the ‘year of exam’ as 2021.Many students of high school and intermediate have already availed of their chance to improve their marks by sitting for examinations held from September 18 to October 6, 2021.

The cost of this tender was around ₹11.6 crore, which ended on September 30, 2021. Before the expiration of the tender, the civic administration had appointed a new agency for a fresh tender, following which the Congress slammed them for spending a huge amount just for the upkeep of the penguin enclosure.However, civic officials say that the cost mentioned in the new tender will cover all the necessary expenses of the penguins like veterinary charges, fodder expenses and life support system, along with the maintenance and upkeep of the enclosure. “In case a new penguin is born then also we won’t have to pay anything extra as the entire cost will be covered as per the tender amount,” informed the official.BMC had extended the earlier contract and shortlisted M/S Highway Construction for the fresh contract. According to a senior civic official, the BMC had opened the tender three times before shortlisting them.“The price quoted by this contractor is the lowest and they meet all the criteria specified in the tender,” said an official. Meanwhile, Congress said that it will question in the committee meeting as to why the BMC is depending upon private contractors when it has its experienced support staff. Congress corporator Asif Zakaria questioned, “Why is the contract being given to a construction company? If they can upkeep the maintenance of this pen, then BMC can also do it easily as they have so many experienced staffers and vets.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-to-table-15-crore-tender-for-maintaining-penguin-pen-at-byculla-zoo-101637599967748.html
22-11-2021||Mumbai||Fadnavis misguided state by saying IFSC will be set up here: Congress||The Maharashtra Congress alleged that the decision of moving the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) to Gujarat’s GIFT City from Mumbai’s Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) has cost dear to Maharashtra as it resulted in the diversion of foreign direct investment (FDI) worth ₹1.63 lakh crore to Gujarat in 2020-21. The Congress has alleged that opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis, during his stint as the Maharashtra chief minister, had lied to the state that there was a separate IFSC planned for Maharashtra.BJP has rubbished the allegations and stated that the decision to relocate IFSC was taken during the second tenure of the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) in the Centre. Quoting the recent FDI figures released by the Union finance ministry, Maharashtra Congress general secretary Sachin Sawant said, “Of the ₹1.94 lakh crore that came from the US and Singapore in the form of FDI in computer software and hardware to India, ₹1,62,830 crore went to Gujarat in 2020-21. Gujarat received 78% of the total FDI received in this sector in 2020-21. This was IFSC-specific FDI. Gujarat, which used to be on the sixth position in FDI, jumped to the top position in the financial year only because IFSC was taken away to that state.”Sawant has alleged that this is a “conspiracy” by the Modi government to diminish Mumbai’s status as the country’s financial capital. “The shifting of IFSC to Gujarat was with the sole intention of making it a global financial hub. It will be at the cost of Maharashtra. In the future, too, Gujarat will continue to get a higher share of FDI because IFSC has been shifted there,” he said.According to the Congress leader, the UPA government had decided to set up IFSC in Mumbai in 2007. The Modi government took it away to Gujarat but the Fadnavis regime did not oppose it. “Fadnavis kept misguiding Maharashtra by stating that a task force was appointed by the Modi government under [former minister] Jayant Sinha to allot a separate IFSC for Mumbai. But it turned out to be hogwash. BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) is responsible for Maharashtra’s loss,” he said.Countering Sawant’s claims, BJP vice-president Madhav Bhandari said: “It has been proven earlier as well that it was the decision [to shift IFSC to Gujarat] of the Manmohan Singh government. The Congress is unnecessarily raking up the issue again. Instead of talking about the FDI meant for IFSC, the ruling parties in Maharashtra should first reply why the existing industries are going to other states. There are many automobile companies which are shifting their facilities from the state or setting up new units in other states. It is mainly because of the extortion spree by the Shiv Sena and the Nationalist Congress Party in Pune and other parts.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/fadnavis-misguided-state-by-saying-ifsc-will-be-set-up-here-congress-101637599848420.html

The prisoner was rushed to Patna Medical College and Hospital where he was declared dead around 12.30pm”, said jail Superintendent Lal Babu Singh. On the other hand, victim’s father Topan Rai claimed that he got the information about the incident around 11am from a visitor. “I got the information about the attack around 11am from a visitor who had gone to meet his kin. I was informed that my son has been stabbed and rushed to hospital,” said Rai while speaking to the media.IG (Prison) Mithilesh Mishra, who visited the spot, told HT that the accused inmate has been booked for murder. “Twenty-one-year-old Munna, a butcher by profession, is lodged in jail since 2019 for the murder of his cousin”, said the IG, adding that the accused had used a scissor to commit the crime. The attack was the fallout of an argument that had taken place between the two some time ago, he said.According to jail officials, the accused procured the scissors from the jail since face masks are currently being made in the campus as a part of jail activity. Inmates alleged that the murder was committed in a planned manner and jail officials were a part of it. According to them, Tuntun was attacked with a sharp object when he was on way to his barrack from the canteen. After the incident, when the injured inmate was rushed to the jail hospital, they found doctors were absent. “The jail inmates told me that he was stabbed at 9 am and had he had to be rushed to a hospital as there was no doctor in jail,” said the father of the deceased. On January 3, 2020, an undertrial prisoner-cum-gold robber Manish Singh alias Telia alias Netaji was shot dead inside the Vaishali jail after which several inmates had alleged that the jail superintendent was hand in glove with criminals and even helped them execute the murder. Later a jail staff Rajkumar Sahni was arrested on charges for smuggling a loaded 9mm pistol inside the jail while police recovered ₹2 lakh cash from his almirah, which he allegedly received as a bribe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/inmate-stabbed-to-death-inside-patna-jail-101637597206855.html
22-11-2021||Noida||MSRTC strike: Act against unions that stop staffers from resuming work, HC tells govt||The Bombay high court (HC) has directed the protesting employees of Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) to consider the inconvenience that is being caused to students and villagers owing to their stir and asked representatives of each of the 26 striking unions to meet the three-member HC-constituted committee and place their grievances and demands before it over the next few days and come out with a concrete and amicable resolution on the issue by December 20. The court also directed the state government to initiate criminal proceedings against unions or persons trying to dissuade drivers and conductors who were willing to resume duties, as it would create a direct hindrance to the education seekers. The division bench of justice Prasanna Varale and justice Shriram Modak, while hearing the contempt petition filed by MSRTC against the workers’ union and its members for not complying with orders of HC and industrial court that had restrained from going on strike from midnight of November 3, was informed by senior advocate SU Kamdar for the transport body that the ongoing stir was causing a lot of problems for students and those living in far off places. Kamdar submitted that though offline classes had started, students living in rural areas were unable to attend schools or colleges as ST bus services were not available. He submitted that villagers were finding it difficult to go to nearby cities and earn their livelihoods. Kamdar said the committee had conducted the second hearing with the representatives of two unions on November 16 and would continue to meet representatives of the other unions too. Advocate Gunaratan Sadavarte, representing the unions and employees, submitted that the state was “not concerned” about the well-being of the striking ST staffers as no medical facilities were provided to the agitators who have been sitting at Azad Maidan since the stir commenced. The state, however, assured the court that two ambulances had been stationed at Azad Maidan for emergencies, and all necessary arrangements were made to ensure that the agitators were not facing any problems. After hearing the submissions, the court observed that the strike was causing a “loss to education” and hence, the agitators should take it into consideration and try to resolve the problem at the earliest. The court also directed the state government to ensure that the issue of loss of education of students was addressed. The court said as some of the agitators were willing to resume duties, in the interest of students and the poor, action should be initiated against unions and their members if they tried to discourage the employees from joining duty. The court has sought a progress report of the committee meetings and posted hearing of the contempt petition to December 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/msrtc-strike-act-against-unions-that-stop-staffers-from-resuming-work-hc-tells-govt-101637597088637.html
22-11-2021||Patna||Bihar govt docs’ body supports 65 facing heat for absence||The Bihar Health Services Association (BHSA), a forum of government doctors, has cautioned the state health department for taking action against 65 medical officers, in-charge of primary and community health centres, for their alleged absence from duty during the Covid-19 vaccination mega camp in the state on October 18. The state health department issued orders on November 16 withholding one annual increment of 65 doctors, who were allegedly missing from their place of posting on the day of the mega camp. Their absence contributed to poor vaccination coverage in their respective areas on the day, health officials said. The said doctors also did not respond to the show-cause notice within the stipulated 48-hour period, the health department had given them to explain. However, the doctors claimed that many did not receive any show-cause notice and had no idea about the mechanism the department adopted to check their presence at their respective workstations. “Many doctors have told us that they never received the government’s show-cause notice. Civil surgeons in some districts like Saran are getting examined the issue of show-cause notice to doctors. Some doctors have told us that they present at their workplace and had yet been marked absent. Others have said they were on field duty for a brief time. We have asked doctors, who feel they have been wrongly faulted, to write to us so that we take up their case with the additional chief secretary and request him not to penalise the doctors,” said BHSA officiating general secretary Dr Ranjit Kumar. “The government should conduct a full-fledged inquiry before initiating action against doctors. Our patience should not be misconstrued as our weakness. The government must not forget the diligent work doctors have done during the peak of the pandemic,” added Dr Kumar. “It is the doctors who work their hearts out and are at the forefront of fighting the pandemic, but are relegated to the background when it comes to giving credit for the good work done either in controlling the pandemic or increasing the vaccination coverage,” he added. Dr Abbas Hasrat, a member of the BHSA said a delegation of doctors was contemplating meeting Bihar’s additional chief secretary, health, and request him not to take any coercive action against the doctors. BHSA member, Dr Rohit Kumar, posted at Saran, said, “We may give the government one week time to reconsider its decision and will convene another meeting on November 28 to decide our future course of action.” Among the doctors facing the heat are 10 from Katihar district, five from Madhubani, four each from Purnia, Samastipur, Bhojpur and Begusarai, three each from Darbhanga, Madhepura, Munger, two each from Patna, Jamui, Gopalganj, Kishanganj, Supaul, Saran, Nalanda and one each from Banka, Araria, Nawada, Sitamarhi, Vaishali, Aurangabad, Bhagalpur, Rohtas, Khagaria, East Champaran and Buxar districts. Bihar had administered over 75.61 million vaccination doses till Monday afternoon against its target to inoculate 73.44 million eligible adult population with two doses of the Covid-19 vaccine. As many as 52.65 million people had taken the first dose and 22.96 million had completed both the shots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-govt-docs-body-supports-65-facing-heat-for-absence-101637597087446.html
22-11-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai Fire Brigade slaps notice to 90 residential buildings for flouting fire safety norms||Mumbai: As a preemptive measure to curb rising cases of fire incidents in the city, the Mumbai Fire Brigade (MFB) has sent notices to as many as 90 residential buildings across 24 administrative wards of Mumbai civic body in the last two weeks owing to non-compliance with fire safety measures in their properties.MFB has deployed a special team of officers who are paying regular visits to the buildings for inspection at the ward level. The aggressive campaign came as a result of Mumbai witnessing several fire incidents in the last couple of months. Now, the MFB wants to ensure that all the residential properties follow strict fire safety rules and have the fire-fighting apparatus functional. The officials were alarmed to discover that several high-rise buildings either have defunct firefighting systems, poor quality water pipes or have not carried out maintenance works of fire systems for many years.As per the Maharashtra Fire Act, each housing society is given a maximum of 120 days to repair the fault in their fire-fighting system if these societies do not start the repair works within 30 days, then prohibitory action will be taken against them.Speaking with HT, chief fire officer Hemant Parab said that in case society is unable to start the repair works within the deadline, then they should flag it in advance or else the officials may take action.“After visiting the buildings, our officials inspect the fire systems and if they find any issue in them, they give them a deadline to resolve it. Even though the maximum number of days for solving the issue is four months, we start to take prohibitory action if the repair works do not start within one month after the notice is served,” cleared Parab, asserting, “Some of the buildings have faulty boosters and some have defunct sprinklers. Many of these issues could be resolved within weeks and do not take four months’ time. If we find that there is an unnecessary delay, then we will be cutting the water and electricity supply of these buildings.”Bhalchandra Shirsat, BJP corporator in the BMC said, “The regulations have been there for several years; however, it is being implemented at an aggressive level now. Hope this process is streamlined and regular and doesn’t get stalled again midway,” said Shirsat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-fire-brigade-slaps-notice-to-90-residential-buildings-for-flouting-fire-safety-norms-101637596967722.html

Roshan has been accused of cheating and criminal breach of trust by actor Hiten Tejwani and businessman Rajesh Jaisinghani.Roshan’s husband, Garry, was assistant director for Kapoor’s Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi and went on to direct several of her subsequent serials. He succumbed to cancer in 2008. In June 2019, Roshan approached them with a proposal for a web series to be developed for online streaming platforms. Accordingly, Jaisinghani paid ₹37 lakh into a joint account set up for the project and a contract was signed.However, Jaisinghani and Tejwani soon started receiving complaints from crew members that they were not being paid.“On November 9, 2019, Roshan informed us that the streaming platform had cancelled the contract. On November 15, 2019, the three of us met in Juhu, where I asked Roshan to return the ₹37 lakh that I had invested. Roshan refused and told me to do my worst,” Jaisinghani said.Subsequently, Jaisinghani also learnt that Roshan had diverted some money to her own account. He approached the Versova police and an FIR was registered on January 27 this year. She subsequently approached the Bombay High Court seeking anticipatory bail. Her plea was denied in October.In its order, the HC referred to the diversion of funds and non-payment of wages to the crew members.“When confronted, there is no material made available by the Applicant while enjoying interim protection justifying the expenses either to this Court or to Investigating Officer. As such, the amount which was handed over to the Applicant in trust appears to have been misappropriated,” the HC observed.Senior police inspector Siraaj Inamdar, Versova police station confirmed that Roshan had been placed under arrest on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bhinder-arrested-for-cheating-criminal-breach-of-trust-by-versova-police-101637596067711.html

The airport is located 72km from the Indira Gandhi International Airport in Delhi, 40km from Noida and about 40km from the multi-modal logistics hub at Dadri.The Noida International Airport is also going to have multi-modal connectivity due to its proximity to the existing Yamuna Expressway and the Eastern Peripheral Expressway and will also be linked to Delhi-Mumbai Expressway at Ballabhgarh in Haryana's Faridabad district.The airport will also be connected to Noida via the Metro as well as the proposed Delhi-Varanasi high-speed rail airport terminal.The other aspects of the Noida International Airport are its ability to serve more than 12 million passengers a year, which will later be expanded to 70 million passengers by the end of Phase 4, according to the release.The airport will be expanded after every phase depending on the passenger growth and traffic and is expected to be completed in the next 36 months.According to the release, the work on the international airport in Ayodhya is in full swing with services slated to start early next year.While there were only two international airports in the state until 2012—Lucknow and Varanasi—Uttar Pradesh currently has 8 operational airports and 13 airports and 7 airstrips are being developed.The Lucknow, Varanasi, Kushinagar, Gorakhpur, Agra, Kanpur, Prayagraj and Hindon airports handle commercial flights||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/uttar-pradesh-on-its-way-to-becoming-only-state-with-5-international-airports-101637594446373.html

22-11-2021||Mumbai||Cruise drugs raid: Man accused of supplying charas is 16th person to get bail||A special court on Monday granted bail to Shivraj Ramdas Harijan, who was arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) for allegedly supplying drugs to Arbaaz Merchant – a friend of Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan. Merchant and Aryan were arrested by the agency in the cruise drugs bust case and later granted bail. Harijan, 33, is the 16th of the nearly 20 accused in the case to get bail. The agency had claimed that they have seized 62 grams of charas from Harijan which was part of the city’s supply network. Harijan’s counsel Sandeep Sherkhane informed special NDPS court judge VV Patil that his client was falsely implicated in the case and made a scapegoat because of “media hype”. Sherkhane also argued Harijan had no links with Merchant and that he had never met or seen any of the other accused in the case in his lifetime. He had argued that the charas that was claimed to have been seized from Harijan was small in quantity, and as such, it was a bailable offence. He had also submitted that even if the contraband seized from the different accused is added, it still would not be enough to make them liable for commercial quantity. Harijan was arrested on the basis of statement given by Merchant to NCB officers under section 67 (any authorised officer may, during any inquiry, call for information from any person to satisfy himself whether there has been any contravention of the provisions of the Act) of the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, but such a statement is not even admissible as evidence and cannot be relied upon, Sherkhane had submitted. He also claimed that Merchant had retracted his statement before a magistrate court. Harijan was arrested by NCB on October 10. The agency claimed to have found charas from Harijan’s home at Murugan Chawl in Santacruz (West) during searches. NCB had also claimed then Harijan was an “important” part of city’s charas supply chain. Based on a tip-off that a rave party was scheduled on the ship off the Mumbai coast, an NCB team led by zonal director Sameer Wankhede raided the Goa-bound Cordelia cruise on the evening of October 2. Aryan was granted bail by the Bombay high court on October 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cruise-drugs-raid-man-accused-of-supplying-charas-is-16th-person-to-get-bail-101637593309001.html

22-11-2021||Bangalore||Bengaluru airport becomes 1st facility in South Asia to commission Rosenbauer firefighting equipment||Kempegowda International Airport, Bengaluru, has commissioned a state-of-the-art firefighting system Rosenbauer Tactical Simulator, making it the first facility in South Asia to have this high-tech equipment, BIAL said on Monday in a statement.The Rosenbauer Tactical Simulator, which offers numerous scenarios to prepare for real emergencies to both the firefighter at the Bengaluru airport as well as to those from other airports, state fire departments and defence forces, will help in strengthening further its such capabilities, Bangalore International Airport Ltd (BIAL) said.The simulator has a cockpit that matches every detail of the Rosenbauer fire truck, providing a realistic experience in the operation of crash fire tenders, including all operating controls, from the steering wheel to turret control, projected through multiple 55-inch HD screens, it said.With this simulator, firefighters can train in a realistic environment, master the tactical use of Rosenbauer Panther trucks as well as operate High Reach Extendable Turrets (HRET) for extreme aircraft fire emergencies, it said.To ensure the safety and security of all stakeholders, including passengers and airlines, BIAL has added four advanced Rosenbauer Crash Fire Tenders (CFTs) to its fleet.Two Rosenbauer Panther 6x6 trucks and two Rosenbauer Panther 8x8 trucks, including two with HRETs, were recently commissioned, taking the overall number of CFTs in its fleet to eight, the airport operator stated.BIAL Chief Operating Officer Jayaraj Shanmugam said, "With the Rosenbauer Crash Fire Tenders, we are well-equipped to efficiently handle difficult fire emergencies. We believe in training our teams, equipping them with advanced tools and modern technology, providing them with hands-on experience and keeping them ready to contain any possible emergencies."Shanmugam added that the tactical simulator will support strengthening the airport's firefighting capabilities even further.The simulator provides incident commanders, crew commanders and lead firefighters an opportunity to gain experience in the tactical use of CFTs through turret control and application of firefighting agents, command and control, vehicle operation and basic driving and positioning skills, BIAL said.Firefighters can be prepared for all kinds of aircraft-related emergencies as multiple scenarios can be customised, the private airport operator said.It added that simulator training increases the professional competency of firefighters as the scenarios are realistic and sessions can be replayed for effective evaluation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/bengaluru-airport-becomes-1st-facility-in-south-asia-to-commission-rosenbauer-firefighting-equipment-101637591321972.html

However, he was arrested in 1874 for "bad livelihood".Following a year-long sentence, Tantya took to more serious crimes including theft and kidnapping. He was again put behind bars in 1878 in Khandwa but escaped after spending three days in prison and became a dacoit.Tantya is hailed as one of the revolutionaries who waged an armed struggle against British rule for 12 years. Reports said he used to plunder the treasuries of the British government and the wealth of their followers to distribute it among the poor and needy.Tantya has since become a long-cherished pride of the Bhil tribe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/indores-patalpani-station-is-named-after-tantya-bhil-all-about-the-indian-robin-hood-101637589754410.html

The requisition was sent under Section 39 of the Patiala Municipal Corporation Act, 1976, which defines the process of removal of the mayor, the senior deputy mayor and the deputy mayor. According to the act, the mayor can be removed if two-thirds (40 required in this case) of councillors express no-confidence in him/her. “Almost all House members have lost confidence in you. Therefore, it would be appropriate for you to either resign from your post on moral grounds or call a House meeting and prove confidence in you as per law,” the requisition sent on November 18 says. A protégé of former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, Bittu has been facing stiff rebellion from fellow councillors over his proximity with Amarinder. Of the 60 seats in the House, 32 are in Captain’s constituency, 26 in local bodies minister Brahm Mohindra’s Patiala (rural) constituency and two in Sanaur. “They submitted their requisition with me on November 18. As per the Patiala Municipal Corporation Act, 1976, I am required to hold a meeting 14 days of the requisition, but the meeting has been called within a week,” the mayor said, “I am prepared and will face the no-confidence motion without fear or worry.”A senior councillor claimed, “The Patiala mayor enjoys confidence of about 18 councillors. His supporters have gone underground as they fear intimidation of some sort from the opposite group.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/noconfidence-motion-patiala-mayor-calls-house-meeting-on-november-25-101637589766867.html
22-11-2021||Lucknow||Keeping politics aside, Samajwadi Party celebrates Mulayam birthday||Sidestepping all politics in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh for the day, the Samajwadi Party (SP) on Monday celebrated the 82nd birthday of party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav statewide.Addressing the party cadres during the main event held at the SP state headquarters in Lucknow, Mulayam Singh Yadav said, “Politics of change is sweeping the country, the youth will usher in change. The enthusiasm of you all will ring in that change.”“I am very thankful that all of you invited me and (are) celebrating my birthday. I want the birthdays of the poorer people, too, should be celebrated. Invite me over for such birthdays, I will try to come,” Mulayam further said.His son and SP chief Akhilesh Yadav didn’t deliver any speech on the occasion.No political activities, joining (of leaders from other parties), or alliance announcements happened on the day contrary to earlier speculation that Akhilesh will join hands with his estranged uncle Shivpal Yadav and his party, the Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party-Lohia (PSP-L), on the occasion.On November 3, Akhilesh Yadav had declared the intent to try and forge an alliance with PSP-L. He had made the politically significant comment in his ancestral village Saifai (Etawah) ahead of the 2022 UP assembly polls.PSP-L also celebrated Mulayam’s birthday at their Lucknow headquarters and other districts. Mulayam’s younger brother Shivpal Yadav reached Saifai, held the birthday celebrations, cut a cake and organised a dangaal (wrestling competition) there.Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, defence minister and Lucknow MP Rajnath Singh, UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath, and many other top politicians in the country tweeted their birthday wishes to Mulayam.The SP celebrated Mulayam’s birthday in all the districts of Uttar Pradesh. At the Lucknow SP headquarters, the party leaders had arranged for two 82 kg laddoos, one 51 kg laddoo, and several cakes which Mulayam cut with Akhilesh and party leaders at the event held at the open-air stage and the main lawns of the office. A song specially created for Mulayam birthday played intermittently throughout the celebrations. The party workers and leaders across the state also organised the distribution of fruits and blood donation. In Lucknow, 82 party workers donated blood.Senior Congress leader Pramod Tiwari and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MP and UP incharge Sanjay Singh called on Mulayam at his residence in the morning and greeted him with bouquets.Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) state president Masood Ahmed and RLD national secretary Anil Dubey attended the birthday celebrations at the SP state headquarters. Both RLD and SP have said that the two parties will announce their alliance for the 2022 UP assembly polls soon.Mulayam Singh Yadav was born to Murti Devi and Sughar Singh on November 22, 1939, in Saifai village of Etawah district of Uttar Pradesh. His cousin Ramgopal Yadav, brother Shivpal Yadav, son Akhilesh Yadav, nephews Dharmendra Yadav and Akshaya Yadav, daughter-in-law Dimple Yadav, and grandnephew Tej Pratap Singh Yadav are in politics.Mulayam founded the Samajwadi Party in 1992 and turned it into a major regional political party.His entry into politics had its origin in a wrestling match. Mulayam was participating in a match in Mainpuri and impressed Nathu Singh, the then MLA of Jaswantnagar in Mainpuri, with his skills and resilience. Nathu Singh picked up Mulayam as his protege in politics and in 1967 fielded his as the candidate on his Jaswantnagar assembly seat on the Sanyukta Socialist Party ticket and himself shifted to another constituency.Mulayam Singh Yadav has been the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh thrice: 1989-91, 1993-95 and 2003-2007. He also served as the defence minister in the United Front government from 1996 to 1998.Prime Minister Narendra Modi extended birthday wishes to former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav on Monday morning.

22-11-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC asks magistrate to defer hearing in complaint against Rahul Gandhi||In a relief for Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, the Bombay high court (HC) has asked the Girgaon magistrate court to defer the hearing of the defamation complaint by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) worker Mahesh Hukumchand Shrishrimal post-December 20 after the counsel for the complainant sought time to file a reply to the politician’s petition. Gandhi’s petition, which seeks quashing of the defamation complaint, will come up for hearing on December 16. The single-judge bench of justice SK Shinde was informed by Shrishrimal’s advocate Rohan Mahadik that he needed time to respond to the petition, and hence, the hearing should be adjourned. However, advocate Sudeep Pasbola, who represented Gandhi, told the bench that the summons issued by the magistrate court had asked the Congress leader to appear before it in person on November 25. Hence, in light of the adjournment sought by the complainant’s lawyer, some interim protection should be granted to Gandhi. Mahadik then tried to interject and wanted to point out the order which was under challenge. But justice Shinde retorted, “Either you argue or you take time to file reply. You cannot do both”. When Mahadik sought for time to file the reply, the bench directed the magistrate court to defer the proceedings beyond December 20 and granted two weeks’ time to him to do so. While challenging the complaint, Gandhi had stated that as the alleged defamatory statement he had made in Rajasthan in 2018 was against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, only the latter could lodge such a plaint. However, as the complaint was lodged by a person who did not have a locus, the magistrate had erred in issuing him the summons and hence, the complaint should be quashed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-asks-magistrate-to-defer-hearing-in-complaint-against-rahul-gandhi-101637589527010.html

22-11-2021||Chandigarh||Politics over power damaging consumer interests||Electricity shortages this summer in Punjab forced activities to come to stand still at homes, in commercial and industrial establishments. It is the responsibility of the distribution licensee, the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL), to make arrangements for providing round the clock electricity to consumers as per Sections 42(1) and 43(1) of the Electricity Act, 2003. Does the white paper tabled by the government in the Punjab Vidhan Sabha serve the twin purpose of providing cheaper and uninterrupted power to consumers? Realistic planning and not politics in matters related to electricity shall achieve these objectives. Narrative around costly power A sustained narrative has been created in public domain that power is costly in Punjab, and that, the prime reason for the high cost is due to costly power purchase from the three private sector thermal plants in the state. However, the data for FY 2019-20 released by the Power Finance Corporation of the Government of India reveals otherwise. The per unit cost of power including own generation for Punjab is ₹4.33 compared to ₹4.79 in Haryana, ₹4.81 in Rajasthan, ₹5.19 in Uttar Pradesh, and ₹5.56 in Delhi. The PSPCL has stated the same in its petition to the Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission for this year’s tariff order. Also, the PSPCL has stated that the average cost of supply (ACOS) to consumers in Punjab is the lowest among its neighbours. The ACOS for Punjab is ₹6.66 per unit compared to ₹6.89 in Haryana, ₹8.04 in Rajasthan, ₹7.35 in UP and ₹6.98 in Delhi. Fixed charges for surrendered powerIt has also been argued that only private thermal plants are being paid fixed charges for surrendered power (power not purchased) and this is making power costly. However, to the contrary, the PSPCL paid a total of ₹1,366 crore for FY 2020-21 as fixed charges for surrendered power, which included ₹841 crore to the three private sector thermal plants in the state, ₹400 crore to the central sector plants and ₹124 crore for other plants. Importantly, the PSPCL has incurred similar expenditure of about ₹500 crore on its own thermal plants. The narrative built up around costly power, therefore, belies these facts and the real reasons for costly power lie elsewhere. What the white paper says The white paper essentially says that the peak demand projections were hugely inflated and this resulted in addition to generation capacity of around 4,000MW, more than what was actually required. Estimates by some quarters have quoted additional requirement of only 2,000MW. If the argument put forth in the white paper is to be accepted that excess capacity had been installed, then, why was the PSPCL facing shortage of around 1,700MW this summer that led it to impose long power cuts? Moreover, power cuts were forced when only one unit of 660MW out of the 1,980MW Talwandi Sabo plant failed. Imagine, what would have been the situation, had there been an outage of 2,000MW! Purchase of power from the grid exchange made at rates as high as ₹15 per unit this summer would even go higher in case Punjab faces further shortages. Regarding the issue of making power cheaper, the government has introduced a bill for referring the agreements to Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission for redetermination of tariff. Interestingly, the regulator, having fixed the tariff earlier as per Section 63 of the Electricity Act, 2003, will reassess its own orders. Will power become cheaper? The white paper has failed to pinpoint the real reason for costly power in the state and that is due to total privatisation of generation in Punjab, a policy pursued by successive governments. The share of the state’s thermal energy in the total energy of the state has gone down from 46% to a mere 3% and it is the lowest in the country. The white paper neither acknowledges this folly nor contains any proposal for correcting the same. Thus, power purchase is likely to remain costly in Punjab. The cheaper and good quality coal from the state’s captive Pachhwara coal mine shall be made available to the private thermal plants unless these plants are acquired by the state. This shall create fertile ground for exploitation of the state’s assets by the private companies. bhupinder4103@gmail.com The writer is a retired deputy chief engineer of Punjab State Power Corporation Limited and convener of Power Sector Reforms Forum||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/politics-over-power-damaging-consumer-interests-101637587846730.html

Singh lodged a complaint against Satyaprakash at the Civil Lines police station on Saturday, alleging that the advertising company has been using Bhagwat’s photo on its hoardings without permission, which is spreading a wrong message about the organization in the society. Speaking to HT over the issue, Satyaprakash said he admires RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat as his “source of inspiration.” The ad agency owner stated that after some research, he found that 40% people don’t cast their votes in elections and hence he displayed suggestions on hoardings how people could be encouraged to vote. “The hoardings I displayed across the state carry photo of RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat,” he said, claiming that he has nothing to do with politics.Satyaprakash claimed that he had a dialogue with regional and district level RSS leaders after some of them objected to the RSS chief’s photo on the hoardings. “I had withdrawan Bhagwat’s photo from all hoardings,” he claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/ad-agency-owner-booked-for-using-rss-chief-s-photo-sans-permission-101637585926680.html
22-11-2021||Lucknow||BJP believes in ‘sabka saath’, others do politics for vote bank: Nadda||GORAKHPUR Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president JP Nadda on Monday hit out at opposition parties, saying that the BJP runs on cultural nationalism and democratic values while the other parties function on dynasty and vote-bank politics.“We should be proud that we are members of a party, which has democracy at its core. It is the part where an ordinary worker coming from an ordinary family becomes the chief minister of the state and a worker like me becomes the president of the party,” he said addressing the BJP booth president sammelan (convention) in Gorakhpur. “The BJP runs on cultural nationalism. Other political parties run on dynasty. We have the ideology of ‘Sabka Saath’ and those people (Opposition parties) do politics only for vote bank,” he stated.Nadda exhorted booth presidents to once again put in all efforts for the victory of the saffron party, just like they did in 2014, 2019 and 2017 when BJP swept to power with a huge mandate. Attacking the Samajwadi Part y leaders over their statement on Pakistan and its founder Jinnah, Nadda said: “I have neither engaged in divisive politics nor given any statement to divide the society. When the election comes, BJP starts talking about freedom fighters and nationalist leaders from Gandhi to Patel but Opposition starts talking about Pakistan and Jinnah. I ask you (booth level workers) to reach out to people and tell them about these people who divide the society by giving such statements.” Samajwadi Party (SP) MLC Udaiveer Singh said: “The BJP and its top leaders are jittery now with the kind of support Akhilesh Yadav is getting. BJP is sensing defeat in 2022 UP polls and they are making the same old allegations.

22-11-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC defers hearing on defamation suit against Rahul Gandhi||The Bombay high court on Monday directed the metropolitan magistrate's court to defer the hearing on criminal defamation suit filed by a Bharatiya Janata Party worker against Congress leader Rahul Gandhi beyond December 20.Rahul Gandhi Gandhi had moved the Bombay high court seeking quashing of the criminal complaint filed against him for a statement he allegedly made at an election rally in 2018.A single bench court of Justice SK Shinde passed the order in Gandhi's petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.During an election rally in 2018, Rahul Gandhi took a jibe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi to say “chowkidar chor hain” (watchman is the thief), prompting a purported member of the BJP to lodge a complaint of defamation against the Congress leader. Taking cognisance of the complaint, a metropolitan magistrate's court issued the process in the case against Gandhi in 2019.Shrishrimal alleged that Gandhi made a “defamatory statement” against Modi at a rally in Rajasthan in September 2018, leading to the Prime Minister being “trolled” by various news channels and on social media platforms.Earlier in the day, Shrishrimal sought time his advocate to file a reply to Gandhi’s petition. The lawyers representing Rahul Gandhi said he has been directed to appear before the metropolitan magistrate’s court on November 25.Gandhi filed a writ petition before the court, saying the complaint was “frivolous and vexatious” and was motivated by the “sole purpose of complainant’s latent political agenda”.Gandhi further argued in his petition that when the subject matter is a question in the public domain and envisages a raging political debate and there are opinions on both sides, it would not fall under the category of defamation, according to a report at LiveLaw.While adjourning the matter after giving time to the complainant to file a reply, the HC bench ordered that the proceedings before the trial court be deferred.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/rahul-gandhi-defamation-suit-hearing-bombay-high-court-narendra-modi-bjp-101637582770700.html
22-11-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt is only worried about Aryan Khan: BJP MLA Nitesh Rane||Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA Nitesh Rane on Monday alleged that while the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government has been worried about actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan, it doesn’t share a similar concern for youngsters of the Maratha community. He alleged that the Maharashtra government hasn’t done anything in the last two years when it came to taking the case of Maratha reservation forward, with no commission formed and no survey conducted yet. Rane told reporters in Thane that no meetings are held to discuss issues of the community and the case for reservation, adding that a village sarpanch would more efficient than chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. He said that while Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) MLA and minister Nawab Malik targets Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) Mumbai zonal director Sameer Wankhede every day, similar attention is not given to education and job generation for youngsters in the state. Rane said, “Owing to several mistakes of the chief minister, the Maratha community has failed to get reservation… The MVA government has even failed to maintain reservation in education and jobs for youngsters. The government is concerned about a Bollywood actor’s son rather than youngsters in the community.” Also Read: Led by part-time CM, MVA most corrupt government: Devendra FadnavisRane demanded that the MVA give proof of what it has done to push for reservations for members of the Maratha community and how many meetings were held to discuss the matter. In response to Rane’s remarks, Congress general secretary Sachin Sawant said the BJP itself was responsible for the issue surrounding reservation, adding that it had been trivialised by the Fadnavis administration. Sawant said, “The 102nd amendment of the Modi government that nullified the state’s power to identify communities as socially and economically backward for special provisions and the 50% limit on reservations was the reason it was struck down.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-govt-is-only-worried-about-aryan-khan-bjp-mla-nitesh-rane-101637584246424.html
22-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi recorded over 1,800 dengue cases last week; overall tally crosses 7,100||New Delhi recorded over 1,800 cases of the mosquito-borne infection dengue in the week ending November 20, taking the tally to 7,128, according to the weekly report released by the municipal corporations on Monday. This is the highest number of infections the city has reported since 2015 when dengue infected nearly 16,000 people and claimed 60 lives.Of the total cases, 5,591 were recorded in November. The cases of dengue usually start increasing in July after the monsoon showers and peak in October. The number of cases goes down by November when the temperatures start dipping.Officials from the corporations, which are responsible for implementing breeding control measures, say the intermittent, heavy rainfall well into September could be the reason for high cases reported in November as well.The aedes aegypti mosquitoes that transmit dengue breed in clean, stagnant water. The rainfall in the city provides a fertile ground for the mosquito to breed in addition to utensils of water, birdbath, and bamboo plants within households.Also Read: 10 new dengue cases, 1 Covid infection in LudhianaThe disease has killed nine people in the city this year. The toll is just short of the 10 reported in 2016 and 2017 when the city reported over 4,000 cases.The number of cases is high this year, likely due to the government notification mandating all hospitals, nursing homes, clinics, and diagnostic centre to report cases of dengue, malaria, and chikungunya.“Of the total number of cases reported this week, 25-30% of the cases are from the last two months and are only now being reported by healthcare facilities.

22-11-2021||Mumbai||Wankhede-Malik defamation suit: HC refuses to pass injunction on Maha minister||The Bombay high court on Monday refused to pass a blanket injunction on Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik and restrain the senior Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader from posting statements against Narcotics Control Bureau’s Mumbai zonal director Sameer Wankhede and his family.The high court said Wankhede, being a public officer, could be subjected to such scrutiny, while stating that Malik should conduct sufficient verification of documents before posting them online to ensure that there are no defamatory statements made against his family.A single-bench judge of Madhav Jamdar’s ruling came while hearing a plea filed by Dnyandev Wankhede, father of the NCB's zonal director, seeking interim reliefs against Malik, including an injunction prohibiting him from posting any defamatory content on social media against him and his family. He had also sought damages worth ₹1.25 crore.Also read | Ahead of HC order, Malik's bombshell: ‘What did you do, Sameer Dawood Wankhede?'Further, the court held that the right to privacy of Dnyandeo Wankhede was necessary, even as it said that prima facie Malik's allegations against the senior NCB officer were totally false. Malik has levelled several serious allegations against Wankhede, including extortion attempts and fraudulent use of caste card to get his job.

22-11-2021||Chandigarh||Death is not the enemy of life, but a part of it||November has been the month of lights and celebration; the receded pandemic has enabled us to cherish some festivity this year. While Diwali was the showstopper, there were some flickers of Halloween to be seen in the streets around my place. To my surprise, the children who were excited about the burning of Ravana in Ramlila, took equal interest in Halloween celebrations as well. They had masked-up to appear scary, waited to be dark outside to go from home to home with baskets full of chocolates/candies hailing Happy Halloween! I wondered, what makes this generation ‘Z’ and ‘alpha’ so excited about Halloween? Curiously, I asked and a bunch of them replied in chorus, “Bhooton ka din hai, isliye hum bhoot bane hain (It’s the day of ghosts/spirits, therefore we are decked up as ghosts).” But they had no idea about whose spirits they were imitating and what was the celebration for! On asking further about whether they are scared of spirits/ghosts, I got some blended responses, wherein a few of them admitted that they were scared, and therefore visiting only the closest neighbours; others pretended to be bold enough, saying, “Darne ki kya baat hai (There is nothing to be afraid of).” My modest attempt to explain to them that it is the day to honour our dead ancestors went in vain because all their focus was in the exchange of candies and they were absolutely disinterested in any free gyan. After the candy business, they wanted to rush home, perhaps, subconsciously fearing that the bhoot might actually turn up! Nevertheless, this celebration made me introspect that inadvertently these children are contributing in integrating death with life. Halloween celebrations originated from Samhain, the New Year festival of the ancient Celts of Ireland, who celebrated passing into another world through a hell-cave that was believed to be inhabited by Celtic devils and fairies. On the eve of October 31, Samhain was observed, believing that the invisible wall between the living world and the otherworld disappears and devils enter through the cave, marking the beginning of the pastoral new year. In later years, in the Christian tradition, particularly in Mexico, Halloween celebrations got associated with All Spirits’ Day and All Saints’ Day, marked to greet their deceased loved ones believing that they temporarily return to the world of living. The day is celebrated by visiting and decorating the graves, dressing like spirits, taking out musical processions, baking bread with human bones carved on it and eating skull-shaped sugar candies and many such things. It is like our own ‘pitrupaksha’ when we fondly remember our ancestors by feeding the Brahmins, cows and crows. Unlike the modern perception of death that makes it a fearful enemy of life, these festivals remind us that there is a continuum between life and death. The increasing interest of our children in celebrating Halloween is an opportunity for our generation to make death socialisation an integral part of their upbringing and creating a death positive environment at home. Integrating death in life as a normal event will make Halloween celebration much more meaningful than just bhooton ka din (a day of ghosts). veenat333@gmail.com The writer is an assistant professor of sociology at Post-Graduate Government College for Girls, Chandigarh||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/death-is-not-the-enemy-of-life-but-a-part-of-it-101637582986186.html

The Capital recorded at least 1,850 fresh cases last week but no deaths were reported due to the vector-borne disease.The civic report showed that 7,128 dengue cases were reported until November 20.Delhi recorded 4,431 cases of dengue in 2016, 4,726 in 2017, 2,798 in 2018, 2,036 in 2019 and 1,072 cases in 2020, the report also showed.There were a large number of people who contracted dengue in the city in 2015 when the number of cases crossed 10,600 in October making it the worst dengue outbreak since 1996.Doctors and health department officials said that Delhi will see a downward trend in dengue cases as temperatures dip due to the oncoming winter season. A health official from the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC), which is also the nodal agency for data collection related to the vector-borne disease, told HT on Sunday that there is a dip in breeding metrics and mosquito density.“The anopheles and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes prefer temperatures above 30 degrees Celsius. Once the temperature drops to about 20°C, they become less active in the open and cannot function at temperatures below 10°C,” the official said.Hospitals have also said that dengue cases have dropped over the past week-and-a-half. A doctor from the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in Delhi told HT that the number of dengue patients admitted in the hospital has come down from 70-80 patients three weeks ago to less than 10 now.Health experts have, however, asked people to look out for stagnant water in their vicinity for mosquito breeding and take other precautions against dengue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-dengue-cases-set-a-new-record-as-tally-crosses-7100-101637582006751.html

The process to repeal three laws will be completed in the coming session of Parliament starting from November 29.Athawale is the president of the Republic Party of India (Athawale), an ally of the BJP.He said that government will hold a dialogue with farmers regarding their demand for law on MSP and thereafter may positively think over it.Athawale was addressing a press conference in Varanasi. He said that the government brought the three agri laws in the interest of the farmers. The government held 12 rounds of dialogue with the farmers and tried to convince them that the agri laws were in their interest and the amendments the farmers want would be made in the laws.Athawale said during the dialogues, the farmers were told that if the laws were withdrawn, it would create a problem for the government to decide in future and Parliament would face problems in making new laws in future. Whenever new law will be made, there might be a movement against it by some people if they didn’t like it but the farmers were adamant on their demand to withdraw the laws. In view of their demands, PM Modi announced to withdraw three laws.“The farmers should end their movement and go back to their homes because Prime Minister Narendra Modi has taken a historic decision to withdraw the three agri laws on November 19,” said Athawale. He said that the farmers should vacate the borders.Asked about the government’s stand on farmers demand to make a law on MSP, Athawale said, “the government will hold a dialogue with the farmers regarding the matter (law on MSP) and thereafter may positively think about it.”Athawale said that he will contest assembly elections in UP in alliance with the BJP. His party RPI will contest at least 10 seats.He said that the opposition parties deliberately hold such discussion that the BJP government may change the Constitution to give a jolt to Dalit reservation. Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati hold such talks. This is a false allegation by the opposition parties. There is no threat to the right of reservation of Dalits (Scheduled Castes). The right of reservation of Dalits is fully safe in the BJP government.Athawale said, “I want to ask from BSP chief Mayawati if the BJP is a party which wants to change the Constitution, then how come a BSP chief became the CM of Uttar Pradesh thrice with the support of the BJP?”Athawale said that the BJP is fully protecting the right of the reservation for Dalits. PM Modi is protecting the Constitution, therefore, I am with PM Modi.Athahwale said that his party, the Republic Party of India (Athawale), will expand in UP and take back its base from the Bahujan Samaj Party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/may-think-about-it-athawale-hints-at-possibility-of-centre-mull-over-msp-law-101637582027802.html
22-11-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab elections: Kejriwal promises ₹1,000/month each for women||To woo women voters, Aam Aadmi Party national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday announced that if voted to power, the AAP will disburse ₹1,000 per month to all women above 18 years. Also read: Cold wave conditions likely in Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan over next two daysAddressing a gathering of women AAP volunteers in Moga, Kejriwal promised women drawing pension will also be benefitted with the additional incentive of ₹1,000. “This scheme will be a unique initiative in India that is aimed at women empowerment. All womenfolk in a family above 18 will be eligible for the monthly grant. The amount may be small but there is something being extended to the women,” said Kejriwal. Kejriwal began his two-day visit to Punjab from Moga this afternoon. In his 15-minute address with a handpicked audience at a resort in Moga, Kejriwal said women of Punjab had a significant contribution in the ongoing farmers’ agitation against the three farm laws. Urges women to become opinion builders He urged women to become opinion builders in support of the AAP to give Punjab a new lease of life in governance and inclusive welfare. “Punjab farmers took a lead in the protest and it was the women who played an important role in building pressure on the Union government to announce a rollback of the contentious laws. Now you (women) should motivate your family members to vote for the AAP to emulate the governance model of Delhi in Punjab,” said Kejriwal. Hitting out at the Punjab government, Kejriwal said chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi has given protection to sand and transport mafia and not done anything to break the cartel. “Punjab has a naqli (fake) Kejriwal who simply lifts election promises made by the AAP but fails to perform. Channi’s announcement to electricity subscribers has failed to take off,” he said. Kejriwal said the party has a well-drafted economic blueprint to roll out welfare schemes in Punjab through transparent governance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-elections-kejriwal-promises-1-000-month-each-for-women-101637580046184.html

The victim, a small businessman working in a news portal in Araria, is battling for his life at a private hospital in Purnia.Locals later caught the accused and handed him over to police after thrashing him. He is under treatment at Araria district hospital in police custody.Araria sub-divisional police officer Pushkar Kumar said, “The incident is related to personal enmity and police are investigating the matter from all angles including a possible love affair.”The accused allegedly had an affair with the close relative of the victim and when the scribe resisted, the accused Suman Kumar Varnwal, a resident of Batouna village under Raniganj police station in Araria, shot the former in the market.According to the reports, the victim had also lodged a complaint at Raniganj police station two months ago after the accused threatened to kill him. Even later, he was threatened on Facebook.District president of Araria journalist association Amarendra Kumar has demanded stern action against the accused. “The attack is indicative of the fact that journalists are not safe and secure,” he said and added the association would hand over a petition to the district administration for the safety of the scribes.Meanwhile, the doctors treating the injured journalist said his condition is still critical. “We are trying our best to save his life,” they said.A week ago, a journalist working in a news portal in Madhubani district was killed and his body was later recovered from a farm field.Meanwhile, the leader of opposition Tejaswi Yadav in a tweet condemned the attacks on journalists in Bihar.

22-11-2021||Pune||Monday Musings: Pune 5th cleanest city in India, but how much of that is reflected on the ground?||Pune jumped 10 spots to be ranked India’s fifth cleanest city in the ‘Swachh Survekshan 2021’, results of which were declared on Saturday (November 20). If the citizens are satisfied with the results and want their city to further move upward next year, it might be a good idea to begin by downloading a government mobile phone application.The survey’s findings are based on more than 25 parameters divided into three sections. Some of the key indicators are segregation, processing and disposal of garbage, and sustainable sanitation. Besides this, a crucial parameter that influence rankings is citizen engagement. Since 2016 when the ‘Swachh Survekshan 2021’ was launched, feedback by citizens appears to be driving cleanliness rankings more than municipal claims and independent verifications.The parameters of cleanliness chosen for the survey seem adequate and its assessment that Swachh Bharat Mission is succeeding in making urban India cleaner might be correct, the on-ground situation may contradict a bit as the methodology used to rank cities appears flawed. The methodology can certainly point in the direction of whether the overall situation has improved or not, the problem arises when political parties ruling the municipal corporations engage their workers to generate positive feedback. Another issue is it relies on declarations made by municipalities concerning the management of solid waste, community and public toilets and efforts undertaken to raise awareness and effective engagement of sanitation works.For Pune, the overall score has been 4,900.94 with 1,540 points out of 1,800 coming from the citizen voice category. The city has received a three-star rating in garbage management with 2,258 points out of 2,400 in trash processing.Pune with an approximate population of over five million is among the largest cities in India geographically. Recently, 23 villages on the outskirt were made part of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits, taking its area to 520 square kilometresAfter the inclusion of 23 villages in December 2020, the city’s daily garbage generation went up by 300 tonnes, reaching a little over 2,100 tonnes. If garbage lifting is a problem in some areas, processing it also is an issue many are complaining about. As reported by Hindustan Times in October, at least ten thermal composting plants in the city are non-functional for the past five years. The civic body has decided to recover ₹9.71 crore from a private firm for the non-functioning of these plants.On one hand, garbage is not being processed at 100 per cent capacity, there are many areas where trash is seen lying unattended. Warje, for instance on the Pune-Bengaluru highway, can be a case in point. Despite several complaints by locals, garbage is often seen dumped at the roadside. To dispose it off in their own way, people burn it, adding pollution to already deteriorating air quality.For cleanliness ranking, assessments by field officers to see the situation on garbage disposal is mandatory. They should visit the areas where garbage is lying so that civic bodies can be pointed to improve the situation, as a result of which rankings will reflect the on-ground status.Adar Poonawalla Clean City initiative by the Serum Institute has already pledged ₹100 crores towards solid waste management and sanitation initiatives under which e-toilets with five years of maintenance are being installed at 100 different public places across Pune city. As a commendable move, the PMC on its part started mobile toilets ‘Ti toilet’ project to address the shortage of women toilets in busy public places in the city areas. These toilets are designed by modifying Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) buses which are not in use for commuting purposes.However, the civic body has received complaints of misuse of toilets, lack of maintenance and some not being in use.Earlier this year when Pune was tagged the second-best among 49 cities in the country considered on the “Ease of Living Index” drawn by the central government, not many in the city took it seriously as the overall quality of life in Pune has been declining over the years.For any survey, if the methodology is flawed, people’s trust in it may diminish. For Swachh Survekshan, the credibility of the survey will receive a boost if some of the issues pointed here can be addressed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/monday-musings-pune-5th-cleanest-city-in-india-but-how-much-it-reflects-on-ground-101637577766325.html

He added that the ban was rescinded to ensure there is no further inconvenience to labourers. Rai said strict vigilance through 585 monitoring teams will continue across the city. He added any private or government construction site will be immediately shut if it is found violating any of the 14-point anti-pollution guidelines issued last month.“We will issue notices later, but construction work will be immediately halted and a penalty will be imposed on the spot, if any construction site, public or private, is found not adhering to the 14-point guidelines. The ban has been removed as air quality is already improving and the labour force was starting to face inconvenience,” said Rai.Also Read: Delhi’s min temperature likely to be 10 degrees Celsius, air quality ‘very poor’Rai said the guidelines, which include installation of windbreakers, sprinkling of water and the use of anti-smog guns at sites with an area of over 20,000 square metres, needed to be strictly followed. He added the AQI was 431 (severe) at Anand Vihar at 10 am on Sunday but dropped to 329 (very poor) at 10 am on Monday. Similarly, at Ashok Vihar, the AQI dropped from 394 at 10 am on Sunday to 309 at 10 am on Monday.“Bawana showed an improvement of 69 points in the last 24 hours, Mundka 80, Narela 86 points and Okhla-Phase 2 (AQI) dropped by around 140 points, from 397 to 283 at 10 am this morning. In a lot of places, the AQI is dropping below 300...”In an order issued late on Sunday, Delhi’s environment department extended the ban on the entry of trucks into Delhi till November 26. Government offices, barring those involved in essential activities, were allowed work-from-home till November 26. The ban on physical classes at schools, colleges and educational institutes will continue till further orders. The government advised private offices to continue to try and allow work-from-home for their employees till November 26.Rai on Monday said they were contemplating allowing CNG trucks into Delhi ahead of a review meeting of all government departments on November 24. “Based on the air quality and the forecast ahead, we will look into allowing CNG trucks into Delhi. Similarly, we may extend or remove other existing bans, depending on the situation.”He referred to a recent analysis by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), which found the contribution of Delhi’s local sources of pollution to be just 31% between October 24 and November 8. Rai said out of Delhi’s contribution, nearly half came from vehicles. He added the government was taking initiatives to encourage the use of public transport. Rai said while 1,000 CNG buses were hired on rent, the capacity of existing cluster buses and the Delhi metro have been increased.“CSE’s analysis shows that out of Delhi’s local sources, vehicles contribute nearly half of the total load. To reduce this, we had approached the DDMA (Delhi Disaster Management Authority) to increase the standing capacity in the metro and DTC buses. This has now been approved and while 17 people can now stand per bus, 30 people can now stand in each metro coach. Earlier, people were only allowed to sit,” he said. Rai asked people to also utilise the new buses that had been hired to boost public transport capacity.“The buses will have the words ‘Paryavaran Bus Sewa’ written on them and they will function like any other existing bus service. We request the general public to avoid using their own vehicles and to travel using these public transport services.”Rai said Industries found using unapproved fuel will be shut down. He added the traffic police and the transport department have so far cracked down on around 4,000 individuals for not having valid pollution certificates (PUC).“The crackdown on 10-year-old diesel and 15-year-old petrol vehicles is still continuing, along with a PUC check.

How many MLAs, how many ministers are engaged in this, everyone knows who they are. From whom is the government asking? Why don't you go and investigate yourself?"His remark came in response to the allegations of Janata Dal United (JDU) in which the ministers had said that if Tejashwi Yadav has any evidence of liquor being sold in Bihar then he should provide it to the government.The Leader of the opposition further alleged that the liquor ban in Bihar is just a hoax."Nitish government should tell how many new liquor shops were opened in Bihar after 2005, and how many liquor shops were there in Bihar before 2005. What major action has been taken so far, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar should tell. Home delivery is being done everywhere. The questions that Nitish Kumar is asking me, he should tell what action is being taken now," he added.Further, taking a jibe at the JD(U)'s special programmes on November 24 on the occasion of completing 16 years of Nitish Kumar's good governance, Yadav said, "In which case has Bihar become unmatched? In unemployment, in liquor ban, in crime rate, education is ruined in that case, dogs roaming in hospital, not a single factory was set up in 15 years, there is flood and drought in Bihar," he said.While talking on the repeal of three farm laws, he said, "The fight for Minimum Support Prices (MSP) continues. The central government should focus on that. The farmers are asking for guarantee on MSP and government should provide that. I also appeal to the Centre to provide 25 lakhs to the kin of the farmers who died during the protest and a job. The Bihar government should also give ₹5 lakhs to the farmer's family."A total of 32 people died in the state after consuming spurious liquor, the recent death being reported from Muzaffarpur.Last week, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar directed the state officials to take strict action against the government employees caught in an instance related to violation of liquor ban, informed Chaitanya Prasad, Additional Chief Secretary (Home).Nitish Kumar had also said that the crime rate in Bihar has come down after the liquor ban and he stands against liquor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-ministers-involved-in-liquor-trade-alleges-tejashwi-yadav-101637567710600.html
22-11-2021||Delhi||Smog and Covid-19: Double whammy for NCR birders||New DelhiIt’s that time of the year again when colourful winged visitors from all around the world make their way to wetlands in Delhi-NCR. But this birding season, bird enthusiasts are unsure about stepping out, as the air quality in the region plays spoilsport amid the ongoing pandemic.“There has been a lot of rain this year, so, all the areas around Bharatpur and NCR are full. Bird walks are happening, but the smog is a big deterrent. People, especially youngsters, are refraining from stepping out,” informs Nikhil Devasar, a Delhi-based birder, who conducts walks every Sunday.‘Birds avoiding water with toxic foam’The lack of clean spots has led to a dip in the number of birds the usually popular spots. “People are not going much to places such as Yamuna Biodiversity Park due to smog and toxic foam in the river. Birds are also avoiding these habitats. Surajpur wetlands are also not seeing much footfall,” says birder Rohit Sharma.Low visibilityEven if the feathered creatures do show up amid the pollution, birders fear the smog would make it impossible to spot any rare species. Kanwarjit Singh, a veteran birder from the Capital says, “The smog is a big issue for birders, who travel long distances to a good spot and then find that visibility is poor due to smog! Smog also affects the health of birders.”To this, Prerna Jain, an avid bird photographer and a bird enthusiast, adds, “The smog is so bad, I couldn’t get a clear picture and photography is all about light. Birds are moving objects and if light is bad, you will have no good images.”Singh reports that among the most interesting recent sightings in NCR were the Indian Grassbird, Brown Hawk Owl, Pallid Harrier, Tickell’s Thrush, Orange-headed Thrush, Gray-headed Lapwing and the Gray Plover.The Covid-19 impactThe fear of Covid-19 has also been discouraging people to go for bird walks in groups. Contrasting how birdwatching has changed since the pandemic struck, Singh tells us,“Earlier, birders would start going out in the field even in September to look for early migrant arrivals. But after the pandemic, birding activities have started late this year and birders have been going out in small groups of two-three. Only now in November, bigger groups of five to ten people have started birding together. In past years, there used to be much larger groups of twenty to thirty persons.”The situation aheadThe annual Delhi Winter Bird Count, set to take place on November 28, will have a large number of birders go out in small teams to known hotspots to take a count of different bird species which can be spotted. The count helps in monitoring the migration patterns of birds.With the Sultanpur National Park in Gurugram — which opened in early November — placing restrictions on the number of people allowed inside, birders are thronging to places such as Bhondsi, Mangar Bani, Najafgarh Jheel, Dhanauri wetlands, Okhla Bird Sanctuary, Mandothi and Aravalli Biodiversity Park. “Right now, people are concerned about the smog, but those who want to turn up, turn up anyway. Yes, for a month or so this time, the turnout has been lower. In the cities, the air is really bad, but on the outskirts it’s better,” says Abhishek Gulshan, a Delhi-based nature and wildlife enthusiast and birder.Author tweets @siddhijainnFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/smog-and-covid-19-double-whammy-for-ncr-birders-101637567985183.html

22-11-2021||Chandigarh||Abohar makes strides in Swachh Survekshan, sheds tag of India’s 3rd dirtiest city||Abohar in Punjab’s Fazilka district made a big leap in the national cleanliness standards from India’s 3rd dirtiest city in 2020 to an impressive 105th position (previous 380th) in this year’s edition of the Swachh Survekshan in the category of cities with a population between 1 and 10 lakh. Abohar was adjudged the 5th cleanest city in Punjab against the last year’s 14th.The urban local body, having a population of 1.45 lakh according to the 2011 Census, is the hometown of erstwhile Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar who represented the Abohar assembly segment for three consecutive terms from 2002 to 2017. Municipal commissioner Abhijeet Kaplish, a 2015-batch IAS officer, was tasked to improve sanitation levels of the city after it fared badly in the 2020 national cleanliness audit. Kaplish gives credit to two sanitary inspectors — Jaspal Singh and Kartar Singh —for leading inspection and execution works. After assuming office in June last year, Kaplish almost doubled the strength of sanitary workers from 130 to over 250. The construction of several public toilets also got the city the open defecation free (ODF+) tag. “The MC bought 25 tippers equipped with global positioning system (GPS) and 75 rickshaws for garbage collection from every nook and corner of the city. We got constructed 200 compost pits where municipal waste was processed. CCTV cameras were installed at the worksites for accountability and it worked well,” said Kaplish.Also, the city residents volunteered for regular cleanliness drives as part of the ‘Apna Abohar Apni Abha’, a campaign started by former district Youth Congress president and Sunil’s nephew Sandeep Jakhar. “Overflowing sewers and heaps of garbage were common in the city till a few months ago. There has been a sea change,” said Hardeep Singh, a city resident.Kaplish said the civic body got sewerage cleaned with super-suction machines. “Over 40% sewer lines were choked and dismal work by a private contractor in laying underground water and lateral lines led to battered roads. It was almost impossible to maintain even basic hygienic standards. But we took all measures to expedite underground pipe-laying works,” he added.Abohar mayor Vimal Tathai said the municipal administration took it as a challenge and resolved to get rid of the tag of being the 3rd filthiest city in the country.“There is no denying the fact that cleanliness infrastructure was in a shambles till last year. The town was deprived of development activities since Independence. We took the criticism in a positive manner and worked sincerely. Collective efforts yielded results,” said Tathai, who took over as the first mayor of Abohar in April this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/abohar-makes-strides-in-swachh-survekshan-sheds-tag-of-india-s-3rd-dirtiest-city-101637529402017.html
22-11-2021||Chandigarh||Punjabi folk singer Gurmeet Bawa passes away at 77||Renowned Punjabi folk singer Gurmeet Bawa, popularly known as ‘Lambi hek di malika’ (the queen of singing in an extended breath), passed away on Sunday. Bawa, who lived with her family in Amritsar, was admitted to a hospital on Saturday evening after she fell sick, her family members said. She was 77. Bawa was not keeping well after the death of her daughter Lachi Bawa, also a Punjabi folk singer, due to cancer in February last year, it is learnt. She was known for her long ‘hek’ (singing in single breath) that she could hold for record 45 seconds. She was one of the artistes known for singing ‘Jugni’ after Alam Lohar and was the first Punjabi female singer to sing on Doordarshan. Bawa was born in 1944 to Uttam Singh and Ram Kaur at Kothe village in Gurdaspur district. Her mother died when she was just two. At that time, girls were not allowed to study or go out without the elders’ permission. But Bawa, who aspired to be a teacher, passed JBT test and became the first woman from her area to be a teacher.She was married to Kirpal Bawa, a Punjabi folk singer from Dera Baba Nanak, and the couple had three daughters, of whom Lachi and Galori Bawa became singers. Her famous songs are ‘Liade chamba, lavan ghare de kol’, ‘Kaharo doli na chayao…. mera babal aya ni’ among others. ‘Ghorian’ (Punjab songs sung on a man’s wedding) and ‘Mirza’ (a song portraying saga of Mirza-Sahiba), sung by her, also became popular.Bawa was conferred with the state award by the Punjab government in 1991, Sangeet Puraskar by the Punjab Natak Akademi, the national Devi Ahilya Award by the Madhya Pradesh government in 2002 and the Shiromani Gayika Award by the Punjabi language department in 2008. She was also awarded the ‘Rashtrapati Puraskar’ by the Bharti Sangeet Natak Akademi.Noted Punjabi writer and poet Gurbhajan Gill, who was close to the Bawa family, said, “She taught in a school near our village Aliwal. She was known in my area as a radio singer at the time. No singer could compete her in holding her breath for so long. She was among few singers who kept Punjabi folk music alive.” Folklore Research Academy president Ramesh Yadav said, “She sang on the tune of ‘alghoza’, a paired woodwind instrument used by folk musicians in Punjab and surrounding areas apart from other traditional instruments.” Punjab governor Banwarilal Purohit and chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi condoled the singer’s death. Channi tweeted, “Shocked and saddened to hear the news of Gurmeet Bawa Ji’s demise. Her contribution to Punjabi folk music is indelible (sic).”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjabi-folk-singer-gurmeet-bawa-passes-away-at-77-101637529160920.html

Those allegations will have to be taken back and a judicial inquiry must be called to give stern punishment to those involved,” she said.The J&K government led by Sinha has ordered a magisterial probe after questions were raised over an anti-militancy operation by security forces in which four people, including three residents of J&K and a suspected Pakistani, were killed at a shopping complex in Hyderpora on November 15. The police claimed that one was a Pakistani militant namely Bilal Bhai, alias Hyder, another was a so-called ‘hybrid’ militant (Amir Magray) and another two (Altaf Bhat and Mudasir Gul) were civilians who allegedly helped militants and were killed in cross-firing. However, the families of the three local residents, Altaf Bhat and Mudasir Gul of Srinagar and Amir Magray of Ramban in Jammu, have contested the police claims.Bhat was the owner of the complex while Gul, a doctor and a businessman, had rented rooms there. Magray used to work at the complex.The families of Bhat and Gul claimed that they were killed in cold blood and were used as human shields while Magray’s father said he and his son was a true nationalist.After public backlash, the administration on Thursday exhumed the bodies of two civilians - Altaf Ahmad Bhat and Mudasir Gul. The police had buried all the four at Handwara, some 70 km away, without the presence of their families. On Saturday, reports quoted Manoj Sinha saying in Jammu that things will be clearer in the coming days and that those found guilty in the Hyderpora encounter “won’t be spared”.Mehbooba said the victims’ families must be compensated and LG Manoj Sinha should apologise personally to the families.She also raised questions over the whole operation of the security forces. “They were saying that four people were there of which one was a militant. We doubt this,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hyderpora-killings-mehbooba-mufti-demands-judicial-probe-apology-from-jk-lg-manoj-sinha-101637528861064.html
22-11-2021||Chandigarh||In Himachal, Covid cases dip but fatality rate still a concern||Even as the Covid-19 infections have started to fall in Himachal Pradesh, the high death rate is keeping the health authorities on tenterhooks. This month till November 20, the state has recorded a total of 2,238 Covid infections and 74 fatalities. The case fatality ratio in these 20 days was 3.30%, highest since June when the second surge ebbed after wreaking havoc in the state. The overall death count in the state has reached 3,812 after 74 people have succumbed to the contagion during this period, as compared to total 78 deaths reported in the state in October. The highest number of deaths in a single month (1,643) was reported in May this year in the state, while the lowest 42 deaths were reported in July. The November spike The state recorded a sudden rise in the death since from November 6-15 when 53 people died due to the infection in just 10 days. Average five fatalities were reported in the state every day. The highest single tally was on November 11 when a total of 10 fatalities were reported in the state, the highest after nearly four months, while nine people died on November 13. Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur admits that the death tally has suddenly gone up in the state. “We have daily infections, but the death rate has gone up which is quite worrisome,” he said. Thakur said it was observed that most of the deaths were reported among home-isolated patients, patients with comorbidities and aged persons. He said respective district authorities have been directed to stay in touch with patients in home isolation. “Apart from it, the authorities have been told to immediately shift the patients to the nearest hospital if their condition deteriorates in home isolation,” he said, adding that the situation has again been improving. Kangra, Hamirpur report maximum deaths In November, Kangra, Hamirpur and Mandi districts have reported the maximum deaths. Kangra was the worst hit with a total of 39 fatalities reported within 20 days and was followed by 13 fatalities in Hamirpur and 11 in Mandi. Five deaths each were reported in Shimla and Una and one in Kinnaur. The prime reason for the high fatalities in Kangra and Hamirpur was the high number of infections recorded in these two districts during this period. Kangra recorded 814 cases of Covid infections while Hamirpur followed with 442 cases. Positivity rate declines, still above national average Even as the positivity rate in the state declined from 1.7% to 1.3% within a week, it is still above the national average of 0.9%. Kangra and Hamirpur are the worst hit districts with their positivity rate above 2% in last one week. The situation has improved a bit in Mandi, Bilaspur and Una. With the positivity rate of 1.7 per cent over the past one week, the Covid situation in the state still remains worrisome with Hamirpur, Kangra and Mandi districts being the worst affected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/in-himachal-covid-cases-dip-but-fatality-rate-still-a-concern-101637528805694.html
22-11-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Dreams of his youth||he life of an Instagram influencer isn’t easy. “I’ll have to continuously update my personality in what I wear and how I look. I’ll always have to convey happiness to my followers even if my heart is broken.”These stresses seem sweet and desirable as long as Syed Areeb doesn’t actually become a social media influencer, the singular ambition propelling him onwards. This evening, though, he is overwhelmed by the struggles ahead. Feeling utterly alone like a shipwrecked mariner marooned on an island, he misses the presence of a person who can nudge him to right directions. Sometimes he has an urgent urge to escape from Old Delhi where he has spent all his 26 years. In fact, this evening he is literally standing on the boundary where Old Delhi meets the new city—he is walking about the remnants of the Walled City’s historic walls, near Dilli Gate.The young man just doesn’t feel any connect with his “congested” neighbourhood. “Many of the boys of my age in Pahari Bhojla have no focus… they pass their time in the streets.” After graduating from Delhi University, Mr Areeb could have taken over his father’s garment shop in Daryaganj. Instead, he earned himself a diploma in “travel tourism and airport handling” from YMCA, and soon afterwards started commuting daily to Delhi airport’s international terminal as a customer service agent—he is among the few young men in the vicinity to have a day job outside the Mughal-era quarter. (It turned out to be lucky for him to skip the family shop, which closed down with the coronavirus-triggered lockdown last year.)Transcending the workday routine of handing out boarding passes in the departure terminal, Mr Areeb devotes the rest of his waking hours to his ardent dream. “Naturally,” he started with his grooming. Speaking fluent English was never a problem because “mumma papa sent me to an English medium public school in south Delhi” Muscles were honed in strenuous workouts at a Pataudi House gym. In 2018, he co-launched a YouTube channel on “fashion and fitness”. That project fizzled out in eight months. Later, he met a few more disappointments.Shaking his head, Mr Areeb argues “so far I’ve been successful from the perspective of my mother. She’s happy I have a job. But the things I want remain unrealised.” He picks up a dry dust-covered leaf from the ground, silently wrestles with his thoughts while crushing the leaf with his finger. “But I’m still in my twenties. I’m focused. I’ll continue to work hard… Mumma asks me to keep hope.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-dreams-of-his-youth-101637528683589.html
22-11-2021||Chandigarh||Himachal farmers demand adequate fertiliser supply||The Kisan Sangharsh Samiti (KSS), Himachal Pradesh, has expressed concern over the shortage of fertilisers in the state and urged the government to take steps to make fertilisers available in every district of the state according to the demand of farmers.It also demanded to roll back the hike in the prices of fertilisers.Shimla former mayor and KSS convener Sanjay Chauhan said there was an acute shortage of fertiliser especially DAP and NPK in all districts of the state.He said the government had miserably failed to provide fertiliser in the state.“If the supply has been sent in some areas, it is not more than 100-150 bags whereas the demand is for thousands of bags in every block,” said Chauhan.He said this time of the year is crucial as it is the sowing season of rabi crops and also fertilising apple trees.He alleged that the government had abolished subsidies and other assistance given in the agriculture and horticulture sectors by implementing pro-corporate, open market and open trade policies and farmers have been rendered helpless and were being exploited by big corporates.He alleged that farmers were being forced to buy expensive fertilisers, seeds, insecticides, fungicides and other input material from the open market.The input cost is increasing gradually while the farmers are not getting the remunerable prices for their produce.The KSS urged the government to ensure adequate supply of fertilisers to the farmers and gardeners in every block across the state and also restore subsidy on fertilisers, seeds, insecticides, fungicides and other input material through the departments of agriculture and horticulture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/himachal-farmers-demand-adequate-fertiliser-supply-101637528742116.html

22-11-2021||Chandigarh||Shimla: Complaint against higher education director over ‘violation’ of Disability Act||The Umang Foundation, a charitable trust working for the disabled, has lodged a complaint with the state disability commissioner against the director of higher education, Amarjeet K Sharma, on the ban imposed on the recruitment of persons with visual and hearing impairment having disabilities more than 60% for the post of school lecturer.Umang chairman and an expert member of the State Advisory Board on Disability Ajai Srivastava said if remedial measures were not taken immediately, he would move the high court to seek relief for disabled persons as the education department was blatantly defying the ruling of the Supreme Court.He said the director of higher education issued an advertisement, especially for the disabled, last week to recruit school lecturers in various subjects.“It was clearly mentioned in the advertisement that the persons having visual and hearing disability more than 60% were not eligible to apply,” he said.The decision of the director of higher education is against the Rights of Persons with Disability Act, 2016, and blatantly violates a judgment of the Supreme Court delivered in February this year, he said.In the judgment, the apex court had ruled that irrespective of the degree of disability, visually and hearing-impaired persons can even become judges in courts. The court had said such disabled people should be provided technical assistance so that they could work efficiently, said Srivastava.He said the Central government had identified the posts of IAS, IFS, IRS, professor, bank officers, and all categories of school teachers, including lecturer, for the purpose of recruitment of the disabled, “but the mental bankruptcy of the education department is playing with the future of the disabled persons.”He questioned when the persons with blindness or deafness can occupy the highest government posts in the country, why they are being debarred to become school lecturers.He has urged the state disability commissioner to take cognisance of his complaint against the director of education and order an inquiry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/shimla-complaint-against-higher-education-director-over-violation-of-disability-act-101637528620755.html
22-11-2021||Chandigarh||Swachh Survekshan 2021: Shimla falls to 102nd spot; Dharamshala improves ranking||The Queen of Hills has slipped 37 ranks in the Swachh Survekshan ranking, a pan India cleanliness survey. It plunged to 102 from the 65th rank last year.The urban development ministry has spent crores of rupees to improve the cleanliness in Shimla town. The municipal corporation in Shimla purchased two sweeping trucks worth ₹1.5 crore to clean the streets of the town. This year, 4,320 cities participated in the survey as opposed to 4,242 last year. The dropped ranking is said to be because of a lack of citizen voice and feedback coupled with an improper system of waste management. Shimla secured 927.24 marks out of 1,800 in citizen voice and feedback, down from last year’s score of 1,049.52. Its total score was 1,624 out of 2,400 in the service-level programme, besides 700 out of 1,800 in on the garbage-free city and ODF plus certificate parameters. The state capital got just a one-star rating out of five for the garbage-free city in the last two categories.” This year we could not do better. Garbage collection was hit adversely due to the pandemic. We will do our best to improve the door-to-door collection. Despite the odds, garbage collectors did a laudable job during the difficult times,” said Shimla municipal corporation mayor Satya Kaundal.Shimla town had secured 26 ranks in the survey in 2016. The decline started after the BJP assumed power in the state.The government is engaging part-time workers on outsourcing, said CPI (M) leader and former Shimla mayor Sanjay Chauhan.“On one hand, these privatisation policies are putting more burden on the public by collecting more taxes and on the other hand these workers are also being exploited by contractors and companies,” he said.However, the state’s second-biggest town, Dharamshala, improved its ranking among the small-town category from 624 ranks to 134 this year. Mandi town scored 155 ranking in the zonal ranking. In 2020, Mandi town was ranked 172. Tea town Palampur improved its ranking from 533 to 214 this year. Tourist destination Narkanda known for its ski slopes improved its ranking from 633 to 276 in the small-town category.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/swachh-survekshan-2021-shimla-falls-to-102nd-spot-dharamshala-improves-ranking-101637528562221.html

22-11-2021||Delhi||DU’s new UG session kicks off today||Delhi University (DU) will start the academic session for the new batch of undergraduate students on Monday completely online, and ahead of the initiation of classes, most colleges will hold orientation or induction sessions for the new students to acquaint them with their respective institutions and departments.The university has also issued anti-ragging guidelines and asked colleges to form anti-ragging and disciplinary committees.According to the anti-ragging guidelines, the heads of institutions need to identify a disciplinary resource person (DRP) in each college, hostel, hall, department and their contact details must be shared with the proctor’s office. The guidelines also suggest sealed complaint boxes be placed in front of the principal’s office where students can register complaints.Amid the pandemic, DU stopped all in-person classes in March last year. While on-campus practical sessions were resumed in February, the sessions were called off in March amid the onset of the fourth Covid-19 wave in Delhi. In September, the varsity allowed final-year undergraduate and postgraduate students to return to campus for practical and laboratory work, as part of its plan to reopen in a phased manner.Manoj Sinha, secretary of the DU Principals’ Association and head of Aryabhatta College, said students from different courses will be inducted throughout Monday. Students of four courses each will be inducted every hour starting from 9am. Sinha said that the orientation will see teachers from various departments apprising students about anti-ragging guidelines, add-on courses, and ECA societies among other things.“Various departments will be holding interaction with students for an hour. All teachers will interact with students and make them aware of the workings of the department through presentations or videos... Teachers will also get a chance to know about students’ hobbies and interests,” said Sinha.The college also provides laptops to help students who might not have devices for online classes.Manoj Khanna, principal of Ramjas College, said that incoming students will be able to log in and take part in the orientation through their college dashboards. All departments will be conducting different induction sessions for students depending on the student strength at the college. For courses that have a high student strength, the college has provided zoom links for the online induction whereas courses having a lower strength will be able to hold the orientation through other available mechanisms.Some colleges are also planning to share recorded videos with students as part of the induction ceremony due to technical challenges. The websites of both Dyal Singh and Dyal Singh (Evening) College remained inaccessible until Sunday, due to which a number of students were seen making enquiries about the orientation session.Pawan Kumar Sharma, college principal of Dyal Singh (Evening) College, said that the college’s website had not been working for the past three days and the issue was yet to get resolved. “The website is down for the past two-three days. The university has assured me that the website will be fixed soon. We are still waiting for the website to start running but if the issue is not resolved, we will share individual links with students,” said Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dus-new-ug-session-kicks-off-today-101637528131485.html

22-11-2021||Chandigarh||Pakhowal road ROB, RUB project set to miss December deadline too||The much-touted project for establishing a railway overbridge (ROB) and two railway underbridges (RUB) on Pakhowal road railway crossing is set to miss its December deadline too. Started under the Smart City Mission last year, with an aim to bring relief from traffic jams witnessed on the Pakhowal road railway crossing due to the movement of at least 18 trains every day, the ₹120-crore project is moving at a snail’s pace.Under the project, a ROB, 839.83 metres in length, is being constructed for the movement of traffic from Pakhowal road canal bridge towards the Hero Bakery Chowk. Besides, a RUB, 1,018.46 metres in length, is being constructed from the Pakhowal road canal bridge up to the Leisure Valley in Sarabha Nagar, and another RUB, 458.20 metres in length, is being constructed from Hero Bakery Chowk up to the Pakhowal Road canal bridge.Cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu had initially claimed that the RUB from Pakhowal road to Sarabha Nagar will be complete by July 2021. Due to pending works, the deadline was extended to August 31 and then further to Diwali and finally till December 31. But as per officials, the project will need at least two to three months more for completion.Work on the RUB had remained suspended for the last three weeks after a chamber of the main sewer line, crossing from the site, got damaged and the area turned into a cesspool. As claimed by municipal corporation (MC) officials, the chamber was damaged by a railway contractor during digging. The chamber has been repaired and work resumed on November 17. But MC officials say the railways is to be blamed for the slow pace of the project. An MC official on the condition of anonymity said, “Around 70% of the MC’s work has been completed, while the bridge on the railway portion is pending. Around 90% of the work of RUB, leading towards Sarabha Nagar, has been completed and it will be opened for traffic by the end of December. But the deadline to complete the entire project will be extended for 2-3 months.”Deputy chief engineer, Northern railways, Williamjit Singh, said the work of the railways is going on as per the schedule and there is no major delay. The railway portions will be completed by December 31. Official speakThe project is being monitored on a regular basis and a notice has been issued to the contractor over the slow pace of work. The railways had delayed the project in the past. The work is now being expedited and the contractor has been directed to meet the December 31 deadline.Pardeep Sabharwal, MC commissionerThe slow pace of work at the site is due to lack of coordination between the MC and railways. Most of the projects being taken up under the smart city mission have been marred by slow pace of work and it is a serious issue. I will take up the matter in the next meeting of the board of directors of Ludhiana Smart City Limited. Sanjay Goel, director, Ludhiana Smart City LimitedEven after the Malhar road project was delayed, the Pakhowal road project has been allotted to the same contractor. The officials have also failed to keep a check on the quality. The MC officials should impose penalties on the contractor as per the terms and conditions of the contract, as the delay is resulting in harassment of the residents.

22-11-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: Railways set to resume general coaches in long-route trains soon||Railway passengers will soon be able to travel in unreserved coaches, like the pre-Covid times, as general coaches are set to resume in long-route trains.General coaches had been excluded in long-route trains this year due to fear of Covid spread. Due to this, only passengers with reserved tickets were able to board trains, which caused harassment to those looking to travel for emergencies. Many passengers even took up the matter with the railway authorities complaining of inconvenience in the absence of general coaches.“Since normal and routine railway operations have been restored, including the hot-cooked meals served by the Indian Railways in the trains, railways will soon start the general coaches which will be beneficial for both passengers and will also benefit the railways financially,” said a senior official at Ludhiana railway station.Moreover, passengers will now be able to book the ticket four months before travel time. Amid Covid, the railways had allowed reservations only 30 days before the scheduled travel.“Since it became uncertain about plying trains amid Covid, long reservations were denied to passengers unlike pre-covid time. A passenger could book his/her ticket only a month before his scheduled travel but now since the situation is back to normal, four month pre-booking has commenced,” added the official.Moreover with the increase in the reservation time, the fare of the ticket reservation has been decreased by the railway authorities.“Railways had increased its reservation charges amid pandemic but now passengers will shell out at least ₹20 less on the reservation,” shared an official.Tarun Kumar, station director, Ludhiana said that railways officials are working hard to restore the operations as were before the pandemic had hit the country.“The numbers of the trains were changed as these were converted into special Covid trains. Like Amritsar-Darbanga train number was changed from 04674 to 14674 while it was converted into a special train but now again its previous number has been revoked. We are trying to restore every possible facility for the rail commuters to make their journey happier and comfortable”, stated Kumar.Many people appreciated Railways for resuming its operations, especially the hot-cooked meals.A twitter user appreciating the move wrote, “It is a great step by the railways as the packed food was really expensive”.An official revealed that railways will also offer the packed food to the passengers along with the fresh hot-cooked food.“Railways have incurred huge losses in absence of catering services as only branded packed food was being served so far following which railways couldn’t earn anything. Now, since the railways will again give contracts to its food suppliers and take advance money from them that will add into the revenue for the railways,” said an official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-railways-set-to-resume-general-coaches-in-long-route-trains-soon-101637525920309.html

They have also been demanding complete transparency in the Buddha Nullah rejuvenation project.Patkar highlighted the issue of Sutlej pollution via Buddha Nullah and other wastewater drains of industries, which pose a great environmental hazard.Patkar said she, along with various other environment lovers, are working on the protection of Narmada as they consider it their mother, and Sutlej in Punjab deserves the same level of respect and protection as it is also a source of drinking water for millions.She congratulated Punjabis for leading the way in the farm agitation and promised to raise the issue of environment protection of Punjab in the meeting of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) as well.A tour to Mattewara forest was organised by the PAC for her to take a first-hand view of the site of the proposed industrial park near the protected forests.She interacted with the villagers of Sekhowal who are protesting against the plan of their eviction from their farms due to the proposed industrial textile park in the area.Kashmir Singh, a resident of Sekhowal village, said the Dalits in the area fought a long battle for land ownership, from the 1960s to 2014. “Our victory was short-lived as we are again losing this land, this time to the government which plans to bring a modern industrial park,” she said.Kapil Dev, the main petitioner in the NGT case against the proposed Modern Industrial Park, said the state government bulldozed its way by notifying modifications to the Ludhiana Master Plan to allow an industrial park on the river flood plain. This, despite an NGT order to first demarcate the flood plains of Sutlej, which the government has been defying till date, he said.The team also visited the Buddha Nullah near Jamalpur to gauge the level of polluted water discharge from the dyeing industry, and the review the progress of the upcoming sewerage treatment plants. Giani Kewal Singh, ex-jathedar, Damdama Sahib, also welcomed Patkar to Punjab and said, “Guru Nanak is the essence of environmental wisdom. Disrespect for air and water cannot continue for very long without causing serious repercussions to the health of citizens.

22-11-2021||Chandigarh||Over 18 crore land records digitised in Haryana||Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Sunday made 24 modern revenue record rooms functional at 22 district headquarters, besides Chandigarh. About 18.5 crore land records have been digitised in the first phase. An official spokesperson said in the near future, the state government will integrate the digitised land record into the state government website www.jamabandi.nic.in The spokesperson said the land records were kept in files and the record rooms were also not maintained properly. Also, citizens have to go through the cumbersome procedures to obtain copies of their land records by personally visiting the tehsil offices and patwaris time and again. The records were also prone to theft, fire incidents, termite and insect attacks in the absence of proper storage system. They could also be tampered with by mischievous elements, he added. Additional chief secretary, revenue, Sanjeev Kaushal said hence it was decided to adopt a system wherein these records are preserved for longer time. Now the land records have been scanned, digitised, indexed and preserved electronically, he said. Simultaneously, in order to preserve the original physical land record, there was a need to maintain them as well. This necessitated the physical modern revenue record rooms which will not only be used for the physical storage of records but also have computerised system for cataloguing, indexing for the process of access and retrieval of these records effectively, as and when required. The spokesperson said that a three-tier verification process was proposed to eliminate the chances of discrepancies in the scanned data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/over-18-crore-land-records-digitised-in-haryana-101637524900234.html

The AAP chief said that Uttarakhand is a religious hub and AAP will make it the spiritual capital of the country and people of Uttarakhand need to get free pilgrimage services to various shrines located in the country. “The AAP government in Uttarakhand will provide senior citizens free pilgrimage facilities to Ramjanma Bhoomi in Ayodhya for Hindus, Ajmer Sharif for Muslims and Kartarpur Sahib pilgrimage for Sikhs residing in Uttarakhand. Monthly stipend will be provided to unemployed, 80% reservation in jobs will be for locals, one lakh jobs will be provided within 6 months of AAP’s coming to power. Also, to check hill migration a separate migration department will be formed in Uttarakhand,” said Kejriwal. Lashing out at BJP and Congress for hoodwinking the people of the hill state, Kejriwal urged people to vote for AAP in the 2022 assembly polls. He said people will see a huge positive change in development work, time-bound completion of projects, corruption-free governance which the BJP-Congress just claim in poll manifestos but fail to convert them into governance. Interacting with auto rickshaw drivers at a city hotel, the Delhi CM said that in Delhi a major contribution in AAP coming to power thrice is due to the support of auto rickshaw drivers and lower strata of society who have been neglected by political parties. Kejriwal also took an auto ride later, with auto rickshaw drivers, local vendors, shopkeepers, local people, pilgrims and tourists trying to click pictures and interact with the AAP leader. A large number of party activists and local people thronged the roadshow of Kejriwal with people lining up on both sides of the road from Parshu Ram, Old Ranipur tri- intersection, Chandracharya square till Shankar Ashram intersection. On Kejriwal’s visit and the crowd that accompanied him during the roadshow, Congress national general secretary Harish Rawat said that Kejriwal is just making announcements but in reality he should fulfil similar announcements made to people of Delhi. BJP district general secretary Vikas Tiwari questioned whether the Aam Aadmi Party had any major face in Uttarakhand. “They don’t have party cadre in all the thirteen districts and they make unrealistic claims of contesting in all 70 segments. Will the Delhi CM and deputy Delhi CM be their faces or crowd pullers in Uttarakhand too? It is BJP which will win 60 plus seats, even Congress is nowhere near us forget AAP,” he said This is Kejriwal’s third visit to the hill state this year. During his visit to Nainital district in September, Kejriwal had announced that if AAP is elected to power in the state, it will provide employment in every household of the state (Har Ghar Rozgar) and ₹5000 stipend till the youth don’t get jobs. He had also announced that AAP will provide 1 lakh government jobs within six months of coming to power in the state. On August 17, when Kejriwal had visited the state, he had announced the name of Col Ajay Kothiyal (Retd) as the chief ministerial face of the party for the 2002 assembly polls in the state. He had also announced that AAP will make Uttarakhand the spiritual capital for Hindus across the world. Earlier on July 11, when Kejriwal had visited the state, he had announced 300 units of free electricity for the people in the state, if AAP is elected to power next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/free-pilgrimage-for-uttarakhand-senior-citizens-if-aap-comes-to-power-kejriwal-101637523700247.html

He also said there was no word from the central government on a law to guarantee assured price for crops. Earlier, Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi had also sought a statutory guarantee for the MSP, stating that they did not trust the central government. The Congress leader’s attack on the Centre came two days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the repeal of the three laws that triggered the stir by farmers from Punjab, Haryana and West Uttar Pradesh. The protesting farmers have been camping at Delhi’s borders for the past one year for repeal of the three laws. Sidhu also said, “Today, as we rejoice in our victory against the Centre’s three black Laws...Our real work has just begun. The Centre’s sinister plan to end MSP, end food security for the poor, end govt procurement and end PDS will continue without the farm laws. It will be now hidden and more dangerous”. In another tweet, he alleged that the Centre’s design to give procurement, storage and retail to private capital was still ongoing. “No word by Centre for MSP legalisation, we are back to June 2020, Small farmers need Punjab Govt’s support to protect them from Corporate take over - Punjab Model is the only way (sic.),” he said. Meanwhile, cabinet minister Pargat Singh hit out at former chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh for lauding the Centre’s decision to roll back the three laws. “Capt Amarinder, a BJP proxy in Punjab as CM, has shown his true colours. The three laws were abolished due to the indomitable will, sacrifice and grit of lakhs of farmers, 700 of whom lost their lives. The ‘maharaja’ instead is paying tribute to his bosses,” he tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/central-govt-s-sinister-design-to-end-msp-food-security-pds-to-continue-navjot-sidhu-101637522619967.html

22-11-2021||Mumbai||Amravati violence probe one-sided, Hindu protesters being targeted: Devendra Fadnavis||Leader of opposition in state Assembly and former Maharashtra chief minister (CM) Devendra Fadnavis has alleged that investigations into the recent Amravati riots were ‘one-sided’ and that Hindu protesters were being targeted by the police for the violence. He said while the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers were being targeted, minority leaders and protesters were being “shielded”. Fadnavis warned that BJP will undertake ‘jail bharo andolan’ if the “unjust action” is not stopped.The former CM, who visited Amravati on Sunday, claimed that the police department was under pressure from the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA). He further said that the November 12 protest by certain groups was organised on the basis of a “fake narrative” of violence in Tripura and it aimed to create unrest in the state. The protestors targeted people and ransacked shops, said Fadnavis. The November 13 protest, in which local BJP members participated, was a counter reaction to the previous day’s incidents, said Fadnavis. He added that the police are trying to ignore the violence that occurred on November 12 and are instead taking action on those who participated in the protest the next day. “The workers of BJP and Hindutva outfits are being targeted and even physically assaulted,” alleged Fadnavis. On November 12, Raza Academy and several Muslim organisations called for a bandh in Amravati, Malegaon and Nanded to protest against the purported violence and vandalism in Tripura, where a mosque and the Muslim community were allegedly targeted. The bandh turned violent in many places. The very next day, BJP called for a counter protest against the November 12 rioting, which resulted in large-scale violence.State minister and Congress leader Yashomati Thakur, who is the guardian minister of Amravati district, refuted Fadnavis’ allegations and said that the government is taking action against troublemakers from both the sides. She appealed to Fadnavis to not spoil the atmosphere in Amravati. “It is sad that Fadnavis is not acting responsibly in this matter. Now there is peace in Amravati and outsiders should not come and instigate violence. We have taken action against all the people who resorted to violence. MVA is taking a neutral view in this matter. I had visited both Hindu and Muslim localities and there was an atmosphere of fear. Fundamentalist forces from both the sides are hand-in-glove for inciting violence and we have filed cases against them,” said Thakur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/amravati-violence-probe-one-sided-hindu-protesters-being-targeted-devendra-fadnavis-101637521659950.html

22-11-2021||Mumbai||MLC election: BJP selects North Indian face with eye on civic polls||With an eye on keeping the support of the North Indian vote bank intact for the upcoming Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has tried to woo the community by picking Rajhans Singh as its candidate for the legislative Council biennial poll that is to be held on December 10. According to rough estimates, Mumbai has more than 27% of North Indian voters, while the entire Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) has 15 million voters, making them decisive. The community leaders claim that of the 236 electoral wards in Mumbai, 184 have the presence of the North Indian voters ranging from 5 to 53%, while in 63 wards the community dominates with more than 25% voters. The community votes dominate more in the western suburbs than in the city or in the eastern suburbs. The multi-fold rise in BJP’s seats in the 2017 civic polls was owing to the support the party had received from the community. The party, however, is pulling all the strings to ensure that its vote share from the community does not decline. “Most of the North Indians living in Mumbai are from the eastern party of Uttar Pradesh (UP) where BJP has a strong presence. The political trend in UP has a direct impact on the sentiments of the voters in Mumbai. With the possibility of a decline in the existing vote share in the Assembly, there could be an impact felt in Mumbai. We do not want to take any chance and have been putting all efforts to keep the vote bank intact,” said a BJP leader, requesting anonymity of name. Singh, who was with the Congress until 2019, has served three terms as a corporator and was also the leader of opposition in BMC for eight years. He was elected as a legislator from Dindoshi in 2009. A popular face among the community, Singh, unlike his fellow party colleague and North Indian face Kripashankar Singh, does not face any corruption charges. Singh was among the five candidates announced by the party on Friday for six seats slated to be elected from the five local body members’ constituencies in Maharashtra. Two of legislators will be elected by BMC corporators. Singh is also believed to be a safe bet for the party after other community faces such as Council member RN Singh, former state minister Vidya Thakur, Sanjay Pande and Jayprakash Singh failed to make much of an impact. “Rajhans Singh has successfully organised more than 500 sessions of chaupals (corner meetings) –the outreach programme aimed to attract the North Indian voters in Mumbai for the civic polls. The party believes that it will help them in keeping the vote bank intact,” another north Indian leader said. Speaking to HT, Singh said, “Yogiji (UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath) has done a fabulous job as CM of UP and it will help us get the North Indian votes in Mumbai. We are aiming to win 150 seats in BMC polls. All the North Indian voters are with BJP.” Political analyst and former Mumbai University professor Ramji Tiwari said that the trend in UP has direct connotations on Mumbai polls. “The North Indian families living in Mumbai keep daily contacts with the rest of their family members in UP. As polls to the Mumbai civic body as well as the UP Assembly are happening around the same time, the UP trend could have a bearing on the voting in Mumbai. The North Indian votes in Mumbai are always split among various parties, though majority of them were for BJP in the 2017 civic polls. It will too early to say if BJP would be able to retain its North Indian vote bank intact,” he said. Kripashankar Singh said BJP will be able to increase its existing tally in BMC polls. “The 50 seats in which BJP candidates stood second have North Indian voters ranging between 2,000 and 10,000. The seats were lost because more candidates from the community put up their candidature. This time we will avoid the split in votes. I do not think our seats will reduce. In fact, we are aiming to increase them sizably. I do not even think that there is any bearing of the UP trend in Mumbai polls. In UP polls, the electorate is divided in the Thakur, Maurya and Yadav castes, but when it comes to Mumbai, it is BJP versus the Shiv Sena for these voters,” said Singh, who joined BJP in July after resigning from Congress two years ago. BJP currently has 82 members in the 227-member house in BMC. For the 2022 polls, the civic body will have an additional strength of nine members. Yogi to hold 3 rallies in MumbaiIn its bid to woo the North Indian voters, BJP has organised three public rallies of UP CM Yogi Adityanath next month in various areas of MMR. “I met Yogiji this week and he has confirmed to hold three rallies between December 15 and 30. The rallies will be held in Mumbai, Nallasopara and Thane to reach out to the [North Indian] community voters in MMR. As Yogiji is expected to get busy with the UP elections after January, we have invited him next month. Other ministers from his cabinet also hold rallies here,” said Kripashankar Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mlc-election-bjp-selects-north-indian-face-with-eye-on-civic-polls-101637521419967.html

In the seven categories of administrative staff, regular appointments have been made on only 727 out of the total 2,268 sanctioned posts. Even as a number of employees have been hired on temporary basis on the remaining 1,541 posts, the shortage has resulted in overburdening the present staff over the years. In fact, no fresh recruitment has taken place for years, and the issue was recently flagged by the Panjab University Staff (Non-teaching) Association in a letter to vice-chancellor Raj Kumar.Existing staff overburdenedIn the letter, the association said that fresh recruitments are required against the vacant posts as the existing staff has been overburdened. According to its members, the last recruitment took place in 2013. Association president Honey Thakur said: “The workload on the present employees has increased due to the staff shortage. The varsity should at least fill the vacant posts in the feeding cadre. The number of courses as well as students has increased but the manpower has not increased over all these years.”Manpower audit underwayThe varsity has already initiated a manpower audit to rationalise the non-teaching staff. According to an official, who did not wish to be named, the audit is being conducted by the Mahatma Gandhi State Institute of Public Administration. “The audit report is expected in a few months and it will reveal the actual need of staff in the university,” said the official.PU registrar Vikram Nayyar said: “Besides manpower audit, the varsity has also written to the education ministry for permission to fill the posts that fell vacant in the past three years.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pu-only-32-non-teaching-posts-filled-by-regular-staff-101637521063730.html

This move is being viewed as a strong message to former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, as the elevation is believably done against his wishes.Tawde said, “I have been given many responsibilities by the party in the past. I was general secretary at the state level, youngest chief of the Mumbai unit of the party, leader of Opposition in the legislative council, minister with eight departments, among other responsibilities in my political career. When I was denied a ticket in the 2019-Assembly polls, I had said that I am a party worker who believes in patience and there was no question of quitting the party for just one denial. The patience has paid today.”Talking about Tawde’s failure to get a ticket in the 2019 Assembly elections, a senior party leader under the conditions of anonymity said, “Tawde, Eknath Khadse, Chandrashekhar Bawankule are heavyweights who were not nominated. This sent out the wrong message that loyalists were ill-treated, while outsiders were given the upper hand. Similar treatment was meted out to Pankaja Munde, who had to face defeat in the polls because of ‘anti-party activities’ in her constituency during the election.”He further added that Tawde was removed from the post of the medical education department within one and a half years after the Fadnavis government was formed. “He was also kept away from making decisions on key issues, including Maratha reservation, during the stint. Tawde’s appointment has come just a day after Bawankule was featured in the list of candidates announced for the legislative council elections to be held on December 10. This is a clear message to the Fadnavis camp,” he stated.Tawde, who had been elected from the Borivali constituency in 2014, is a key Konkani leader. His elevation is also seen as an attempt to woo the Konkani voters living in Mumbai ahead of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation elections.BJP leader Ashish Shelar said that it is a happy moment for the Maharashtra unit of the party. “He has been a prominent leader from the state. As a secretary and in charge of Haryana, he has done an impressive job. His elevation is a delight for all of us,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/patience-has-paid-today-says-vinod-tawde-becomes-bjp-s-general-secretary-101637521061844.html
22-11-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Skewed development irks Dhanas village residents in Ward 14||Ward No. 14 comprises Dhanas village, which came under the Chandigarh municipal corporation in 2018, besides parts of Dhanas — LIG Colony, Milkman Colony, Aman Colony, Chaman Colony and Ambedkar Colony — that were under Ward No. 5 before the fresh delimitation earlier this year. Locals claim that while there has been some development in the colonies, the village continues to face neglect.Bhim Singh, a former Dhanas village panchayat member who will be voting in the MC elections for the first time, says: “The main road leading to the village hasn’t been repaired for seven years. The streetlights don’t work. Around 25% of the area lies outside the lal dora. Now that the village will have a councillor to represent us in the MC, we expect these issues to be resolved and new development works to kick off on a similar scale as in the adjoining colonies.”Parking pangs in coloniesAt Chaman, Aman and Ambedkar colonies, roads are narrow and paved parking spaces have been made on the roadside. However, with the number of vehicles going up, the space is not enough. Sanjay Chauhan, a resident of Chaman Colony, says: “We need more space for parking vehicles. People end up parking vehicles on the main road, which is already narrow; so it leaves no space to move, especially at night.”Moving on the inner lanes is as problematic. Tara Singh, 80, of Ambedkar Colony, says the uneven roads haven’t been repaired for years. “The roads become especially bad after rain. Just recently, a neighbour slipped and got injured.” Cattle an irritant at Milkman Colony Even as Milkman Colony is the most affluent locality in the area with big plots for bungalows, cattle roam freely on roads and in parks, raising sanitation issues. Avtar Singh, president of the Resident Welfare Association here, says, “We had demanded that Milkman Colony be declared Sector 14 West, which was approved by the administration in 2020. While the area is called Milkman Colony, only a few people rear animals. They are supposed to keep them inside their premises, but still let them loose, creating problems for others.” Area councillor Sheela Devi also resides in the colony. “The dispute regarding cattle has gone on for a long time. I have spoken to senior MC officials to challan those who rear their cattle on public land. We have also developed 40 parks in Dhanas,” she said.Know your wardLocalities: Dhanas village; LIG Colony, Milkman Colony, Aman Colony, Chaman Colony and Ambedkar Colony, all in DhanasGeneral ward with around 15,000 votersKey issuesDhanas village is lagging behind in development as compared to the coloniesShortage of parking spaces and dilapidated streets a key issue in coloniesMilk Colony residents irked by cattle being let loose in parksLocal voicesWater bills have increased manifold even as the supply continues to suffer, especially in market areas: Sunil Kumar, 49, a resident of Milk Colony who runs a dhaba in the areaWe need development on a par with colonies.

Around four acres of land is lying vacant near the gurdwara along the Airport Road.The directions were given in a meeting chaired by the CM recently. MLA Balbir Singh Sidhu and GMADA chief administrator Vipul Ujwal attended it along with other senior officials. Mohali already has the region’s first air-conditioned Inter-State Bus Terminus (ISBT) along the Chandigarh-Kharar highway in Phase 6, Mohali, which also houses a commercial complex. Twelve years after its inception, the bus terminal has become partially operational, but the commercial project is stuck in corporate insolvency resolution process.The demand for a new bus stand within the city was made by Sidhu, following which the CM directed GMADA to finalise the site, said a senior officer who was present in the meeting.‘Will finalise site in first week of December’“We are hopeful of finalising the site in the first week of December. One chunk of land of nearly 4 acres is lying vacant near the gurdwara in Sohana. As land rates are very high on the Airport Road, we are planning for mixed land use, wherein we can have the bus stand in the basement and commercial activities on the ground floor to compensate for the high land cost,” said the GMADA officer, who did not wish to be named.As far as the existing ISBT is concerned, GMADA has shown interest in taking over the project. In 2019, the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT)’s special bench had initiated corporate insolvency resolution process for C&C Towers Limited, which was allotted the project in 2009. Once GMADA takes over the project, it will also take over all liabilities of stakeholders, investors and depositors and will run all activities of the commercial complex, except the operations of ISBT, which will be transferred to the Punjab state transport department, according to the officer.‘ISBT too far off for local commuters’Meanwhile, Balbir Singh Sidhu said that as the Mohali municipal corporation is set to launch a city bus service, a bus stand is needed in the centre of the city. “As the new bus stand will be on the Airport Road, it will be convenient for local commuters. The present bus stand is out of bounds for city residents, as they have to pay around ₹200 for commute,” he said.The Mohali MC General House had approved the agenda pertaining to the city bus service earlier this month. The service is expected to be rolled out from January 1, with an initial fleet of six buses on eight routes within the MC limits. The project had been hanging fire for a decade.However, questions have been raised on the proposal to build a bus stand on the busy Airport Road, especially at the congested site near the gurdwara. According to sources, even buses plying to other parts of Punjab will use the new bus stand.Harpreet Singh, a member of the district road safety committee, said: “Airport Road is the busiest road and prone to accidents. The authorities concerned should be very cautious in adding more heavy traffic volume on this road. The road safety issue should be taken into consideration before planning a new bus stand.” Meanwhile, sources said that the CM has also asked GMADA to construct an auditorium on the lines of Chandigarh’s Tagore Theatre in Sector 78 and a new Dussehra ground in Sector 90.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohali-to-get-new-bus-stand-near-sohana-gurdwara-on-airport-road-101637521001055.html
22-11-2021||Chandigarh||Zirakpur: Third FIR registered against GBP Group management||The Zirakpur police on Sunday registered third FIR against the Gupta Builders and Promoters (GBP) Group for failing to give possession of properties to the buyers. Around two months back, GBP Group management had left the country without completing various real estate projects in Mohali district and leaving 2,500 investors in the lurch, following which two cases were registered against them.The Mohali police have already issued lookout circulars against the group’s three directors: Satish Gupta, Raman Gupta and Pardeep Gupta. Around 70 allottees, who had invested money in the group’s Athens (residential and commercial) and Aeroze (residential) projects – both on the Airport Road – filed a police complaint after they were not given possession and the work was stopped. One of the complainants, Ujjwal Sethi of Sector 45, Chandigarh, said: “We have taken loans from the bank and we are paying instalments as well rent for our house. The builders promised us possession four years back. Now, even the work has been stopped.” “A case under Sections 406 (criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) has been registered against the GBP Group management and we have initiated proceedings to arrest them,” said Onkar Singh Brar, station house officer, Zirakpur. The realty firm has several ongoing projects in Mohali. Among them, Camelia, offering both residential and commercial units, in Kharar, and GBP Centrum (commercial) in Zirakpur have been under construction since 2016. At another residential colony in New Chandigarh, where plots have been sold, construction has not even begun.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/zirakpur-third-fir-registered-against-gbp-group-management-101637520999919.html
22-11-2021||Pune||Pune’s performing arts’ festivals waiting for govt clarity before going ahead||Music and performing art aficionados usually warm up for the winter chill with a feast of festivals in the city. Because of the pandemic and Covid-induced restrictions, many festivals had to be cancelled or were held online last year. As Covid cases have gone down and restrictions have been considerably eased this year, organisers of the music and performing arts’ festivals are optimistically looking forward to hosting the shows this year. They are however, seeking clarity from the administration on rules related to shows on open grounds and have also demanded relaxations of the 50% occupancy rule for auditoriums. Shrinivas Joshi, executive secretary of the Arya Sangeet Prasarak Mandal that organises the Sawai Gandharva Bhimsen Mahotsav said that he is looking forward to organising the mahotsav this year. “We are receiving a lot of queries from the audience as well. We need more clarity whether we will be allowed to old the performances on open grounds. A Mahotsav like this cannot be held in an auditorium. Because of Covid restrictions, it could not be held last year. Following the Covid protocols we did hold a programme online as it was the birth centenary year of Pandit Bhimsen Joshi,” said Joshi. “Whatever situation , maybe the Swar Jhankar festival will be held this year. It would help to plan the details of the festival if more clarity on relaxation of the 50% occupancy is given. Everyone is requesting that the festival should happen as people are also seeking a sense of normalcy. We are hoping for the best,” said Rajas Upadhye, chief executive officer, Swar Jhankar music festival. This is the birth centenary completion year of late veteran singer Vasantrao Deshpande. His grandson and popular classical singer Rahul Deshpande confirmed that the famous Vasantotsav, a 14-year old music festival would be organised this year. “It has been planned for the third week of January,” said Rahul Deshpande from Goa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/punes-performing-arts-festivals-waiting-for-govt-clarity-before-going-ahead-101637520879897.html
22-11-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram civic body to clean stormwater drain along Old Delhi-Gurgaon Road||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) will desilt and clean one-kilometre portion of the stormwater drain along the Old Delhi-Gurgaon Road from next month, said officials on Sunday.The kilometre-long stretch of the Old Delhi-Gurgaon Road falls under Dundahera village, just before the Delhi-Gurugram border.The stormwater drain runs parallel to the main carriageway, linking the national capital and Gurugram. Due to the area being located right next to the border, there is a heavy movement of vehicles, cyclists and pedestrians, said the officials.Drains along the stretch, which were developed in the 1980s, are riddled with issues. According to the MCG officials, besides the mixing of stormwater and sewerage lines, the drain is also broken at several points, resulting in rainwater overflowing onto the main carriageway during the monsoon season, inundating the stretch and triggering snarls.“We observed that the stormwater drain is connected to many bathrooms and kitchens in the village due to which there is mixing of sewerage and stormwater lines. Additionally, the stormwater drain has developed holes and cracks at several points, due to which, some portion of the rainwater is inadvertently flowing and mixing with the sewerage line,” said a senior MCG official privy to the matter, adding that the line has also clogged due to the mixing of drains and dumping of waste at the exposed portions. “Our first objective is to clear all debris and garbage from the stormwater line. Subsequently, we will fix all the cracks and gaps, and then align the entire line with the master stormwater line,” said another senior MCG official from its engineering wing, requesting anonymity.The MCG has floated a ₹13.90 lakh tender for the project bids, which will open on Thursday.Last month, the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) announced that they have been renovating and upgrading drainage lines along the entire 7.5-km-long Old Delhi-Gurgaon Road. As part of the project, the GMDA is widening and upgrading the stormwater drains for a projected cost of ₹16 crore, which will also include construction of rainwater harvesting pits and aligning the width of the upstream and downstream portions of the drain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-civic-body-to-clean-stormwater-drain-along-old-delhi-gurgaon-road-101637520702150.html
22-11-2021||Pune||Schools set to reopen after Diwali holidays, but principals want full attendance to be allowed||As schools reopen after the Diwali vacations on November 22, teachers believe that classes should be reopened at full capacity to avoid any more loss of classes for students. At present, only classes 8 to 12 are allowed to reopen at 50 per cent capacity as per directives of the education department. Speaking about the school reopening, Harishchandra Gaikwad, president of the Pune District Principals’ Association said that majority schools will reopen from November 22.“Although the official Diwali vacation ended on November 20, not many students turned up that day. However, from Monday (November 22), students are likely to attend school and schools will restart,” said Gaikwad.“Due to 50 per cent capacity at schools, teachers have to repeat what they are teaching twice. This will lead to a delay in completion of the syllabus. Also, the motivation of teachers is decreasing day by day,” said Gaikwad.He also shared that the students from Classes 8 to 12 are attending schools in urban areas. “There is less fear of Covid among parents and students now. We can see that parents want their children to attend offline school. Because of the online schooling, many students do not have their concepts clear. This will affect their future performance,” said Gaikwad.Medha Sinnarkar, principal, Laxmanrao Apte Prashala said that teachers are investing time teaching one subject repeatedly due to the 50 per cent capacity rule.“As students are now well aware about Covid protocol, they should be granted permission to attend school in full capacity. Moreover, for subjects like social sciences, the weekly lectures are already few. If teachers have to take two lectures to finish the same topics then it becomes hectic for them as well,” said Sinnarkar.She added that many teachers are forced to finish their syllabus through online lectures as well. “This in turn affects the learning of the students. In this view, schools should be started in full capacity,” said Sinnarkar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/schools-set-to-reopen-after-diwali-holidays-but-principals-want-full-attendance-to-be-allowed-101637520641095.html
22-11-2021||Gurugram||Air quality worsens in Gurugram, but still in ‘very poor’ category||The air quality in Gurugram worsened on Sunday, though it remained in the ‘very poor’ category. The city recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 364 on Sunday against 345 a day earlier, according to data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).Experts, however, said that the situation is likely to improve in the coming days as the dense plumes of smoke, which were visible in satellite images of Delhi-NCR a few days ago, have reduced considerably through Saturday and Sunday.According to the CPCB, the air quality in Gurugram remained in the ‘very poor’ category with heavy accumulation of particulate matter in the air for the seventh consecutive day on Sunday.At the four air quality monitoring stations in Gurugram, the AQI recorded at Teri Gram was 375, 374 at Vikas Sadan, 362 at Sector 51 and 343 at Gwal Pahari.According to the CPCB guidelines, an AQI between zero and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.Meanwhile, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) predicted stronger winds in coming days and said that it will be favourable for better dispersion of pollutants as the air quality is likely to improve to the ‘poor’ and ‘moderate’ category on Monday and Tuesday (November 22 and 23).“Predominant surface winds are likely to come to the city from the northwest direction of Delhi with a wind speed 12-20 kilometre per hour (kmph) and strong surface winds with a speed of 20-30 kmph during Monday,” said the IMD, adding that the city may see a clear sky and experience mist on Monday and Tuesday mornings.On Sunday, the IMD recorded the maximum and minimum temperatures in Gurugram at 24.4 degrees Celsius (°C) and 10.6°C, respectively.Dr Anurani Sharma, associate professor of Teri School of Advanced Studies, said, “The wind speed in the coming days is likely to be more than 10kmph, which will improve things... as compared to the average wind speed of 2kmph on Saturday. Satellite images are also showing relatively less plumes over this region now.”Dr Sachin Pawar, a Gurugram-based air quality specialist, said that there is a dip in the temperature as the pollutants closer to the ground are not getting dispersed.“There will be a constant drop in the temperatures as winter is coming, and this will ensure that pollutants don’t get dispersed. Pollution levels are likely to remain high for the next 10 days,” said Pawar.An official of the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), requesting anonymity, said that the pollutants are likely to disperse over the region, which will help in improving the air quality, as the wind speed is picking up. A strict watch is being kept in all the areas, he added.Meanwhile, Yash Garg, deputy commissioner, Gurugram, said, “Civic agencies have been directed to implement anti-pollution measures strictly. Action is being taken against all the violators,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/air-quality-worsens-in-gurugram-but-still-in-very-poor-category-101637520639857.html
22-11-2021||Gurugram||Crackdown on sell of hookah in pubs and bars in Gurugram||Two days after three ahatas (drinking places) were found operating beyond permissible timings and serving hookah, excise officials have formed teams to keep a check on operations at night.These teams have started surprise checks and taken action against restaurants, pubs and bars which serve hookah -- as recovered from three ahatas (drinking places) late Friday night, and more than 15 people were present at each place. Each team will be led by assistant excise and taxation officers (AETO) and excise inspectors, according to the department.VK Beniwal, deputy commissioner of excise and taxation, Gurugram (East), said that most of the complaints come from the Golf Course Extension Road and developing areas. “We have directed the teams to conduct reconnaissance of these areas before searches and surprise checks,” he said.Beniwal also said that people found operating such places illegally or violating the excise policy will face issues while renewing licenses. “The documents will be sent to Chandigarh, so that the headquarters can take action against the violators directly,” he said.The chief minister’s flying squad has also been receiving complaints for the past few weeks that some small places are serving liquor and hookah without licences, said police, adding that a few pubs and bars in the city also serve vapes and e-hookahs these days.“Vapes are being used nowadays. A liquid is heated, which generates an aerosol or vapour inhaled by the consumers,” said Inderjeet Yadav, deputy superintendent of police (crime).Police said if they find any place serving hookah illegally, they will register a legal case against it under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and 120 (conspiracy), and sections 4 and 6 of the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act, and Section 72C of the Punjab Excise Act.The district administration had invoked Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) Section 144 on March 2, 2012, to stop the operations of hookah bars. Within a year, the health and police departments closed seven hookah bars across the city after searches. Also, in July 2013, more than 100 students from prominent schools were caught in a bar -- Hookah Baron -- during a search conducted by the excise department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/crackdown-on-sell-of-hookah-in-pubs-and-bars-in-gurugram-101637520579834.html

The injured were identified as Deepak Kumar from Bhiwani, Dhiraj Kumar of Gurugram and Deepak Kumar of Rewari, said police, adding that they are lodged in the jail for several murder cases. Police said members of the two gangs -- Dandi gang and Ashok Rathi gang -- were involved in the clash.A case was registered against Rajeev alias Raju of Basai in Gurugram and his close aides. Rajeev is a member of Kala gang, police said, adding the reason for the clash could not be established immediately. The injured were taken to the Civil Hospital at Sector 10 from where they were referred to PGIMS, Rohtak, the officials said. Jagbir Singh, station house officer of Bhondsi police station, said that they were carrying grudges against each other since last year after triple murder in Basai. “This is not the first time that violence erupted in the jail. There have been several incidents where inmates have attacked each other,” he said. Singh said that last month both gang members were taken to the local court for their case hearing where they landed in a tiff. “The members of the two gangs were looking for the right opportunity to attack each other. On Saturday evening, they got the chance and members of Dandi gang attacked the three members of Rathi gang while they were standing outside the barrack,” he said. The suspects were booked for attempt to murder and threatening for life, said police. Police said they will take the suspects on production warrant and interrogate them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gurugram-members-of-rival-gangs-clash-in-bhondsi-jail-three-injured-101637520520246.html
22-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi: 5% of ward tax collection to be reserved for EDMC local development fund||In a bid to incentivise tax collections and increase its revenue, the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) will allocate 5% of property taxes and license fee collected from each ward to its local area development (LAD) fund. A senior EDMC official said that cap of ₹50 lakh has been fixed on this councillor LAD fund. The tax and fee collection to be considered under this scheme include property tax, general trade license, health trade license, veterinary license and factory license. The civic body’s jurisdiction is divided into 64 municipal wards, split into two administrative zones — Shahdara North and Shahdara South.East Delhi municipal commissioner Vikas Anand said that to implement this scheme, a councillor-wise record of an area’s development work will be maintained. “The councillor of the area concerned must ensure that the development work is necessary and cannot be postponed. Payments will be released depending on the availability of funds,” he said.“While undertaking development work, the councillor will ensure that financial discipline and prudence are followed,” Anand added.EDMC mayor Shyam Sunder Aggarwal said that the civic body has not been able to provide any LAD funds due to financial constraints, except for one annual cycle in the past five years, when councillors were given ₹30 lakh each. He, however, said he was not entirely in support of the policy“The idea behind the scheme may be to push councillors to improve tax collections in their areas, but it will also lead to disparity between rich and poor areas. Shahdara South is relatively more affluent, with developed commercial areas and tax collections will be higher. I am in favour of increasing tax collections, but an economically backward area should not be penalised to achieve that goal,” Aggarwal said. Resident welfare groups welcomed the idea, but urged that a monitoring mechanism involving local citizens be put in place. BS Vohra who heads the East Delhi RWA Joint Front said that that the record of collections from an area and its utilisation should be made public. “It is public money and should be used for public welfare. But the 5% quantum is too little and should be raised. For instance, the construction of a mid-sized inner colony lane alone takes ₹7-8 lakh,” Vohra said. Atul Goel, who heads URJA, an umbrella body of resident welfare groups, said ward consultative committees involving RWAs should be formed to prioritise work to be undertaken using such a fund. “Basic parity between wards should be ensured, as some wards will have higher tax collections due to commercialisation and dense population. These areas will also need more development work due to a larger number of users,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-5-of-ward-tax-collection-to-be-reserved-for-edmc-local-development-fund-101637520342893.html

Of six towers in the project, only three have been delivered by the builder, International Land Developers (ILD).“Around 500 buyers in three towers are waiting for their flats for the past nine years, but nothing has happened. We have approached the authorities also, but things are not working. Many buyers invested their retirement savings in the project,” said Alok Kumar, a member of ILD Green Flat Buyers Association. Anjali Sharma, a homebuyer, said that despite long delays, the developer is now sending demand notices while there is no work going on at the project site. The association members also said that they plan to hold protests if their flats are not delivered soon. Manmohan Sharma, another buyer, said that the work on tower number two has completely stopped. “We will again be approaching the Haryana Real Estate Regulatory Authority (H-Rera) to get relief,” he said. The developer did not respond to phone calls and text messages sent by HT on Sunday. However, on the same issue, a senior ILD official had said last year, “A mitigation plan has been submitted at H-Rera. We have been able to work cohesively with the clients and have almost completed the works for T6 & T7. As per the mitigation plan, Tower 2 is to be subsequently completed after T6 & T7.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gurugram-ild-green-buyers-hold-meeting-threaten-to-protest-against-developer-101637520219913.html

Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta inaugurated the room at the Sinhagad road police station on Saturday. The city police set up its first child-friendly room at the Cantonment station in Camp in December 2020. The Juvenile Justice Act 2015 stipulated that all departments working with children must be child friendly. All children in need of protection within the jurisdiction of the police station and in conflict with the law should be rehabilitated in a child-friendly environment. For this purpose, special rooms have been set up on the premises of the police stations. According to the police, the main aim of the child friendly room initiative was to provide an environment that will enable children to report cases without fear and it will benefit even those children who have committed offences and ensure that repeat offenders and children from nearby communities are not engaged in criminal activities and, on the contrary, support police in prevention of crime. Also present on the occasion were Caroline Valter, founder CEO of Hope for The Children Foundation, joint CP (law and order) Ravindra Shisve, additional CP Rajendra Dahale, Pune Police psychology well-being group member Gayatri Kotbagi, actress Parna Pethe, former member of NCPCR Rupa Kapoor, District Child Protection Officer Param Anand, DCP (Zone III) Pournima Gaikwad, ACP (Sinhgad division) Sunil Pawar and ACP (Kothrud division) Gajanan Tonpe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/six-police-stations-in-pune-now-have-child-friendly-rooms-101637520159846.html
22-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi pollution: Mercury dips, air quality improves marginally||Temperatures in Delhi fell sharply on Sunday on the back of faster winds and clear skies, as scientists at the Indian weather office warned that the mercury will continue to drop in the coming days. Pollution levels also improved marginally, owing to the bump in wind speeds and a change in their pattern.Recordings by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) showed that on Sunday, the minimum temperature at Safdarjung, Delhi’s base station, was 9.8 degrees Celsius, three below normal for this time of the year, and nearly five notches lower than Saturday’s minimum temperature.The maximum temperature was on Sunday was 27.3°C, a notch above normal.IMD forecasters explained that this drop in temperatures on Sunday was because of a change in direction of winds blowing into Delhi, which went from from southeasterly to northwestly the previous evening.The city also saw clearer skies on Saturday night, which also helped the surface cool at a faster rate.“The temperatures in Delhi and most parts of northwest India are likely to fall by two to four degrees during the next three days,” a senior Met official said.Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change) at Skymet Weather Services said the winter chill is expected to set in the coming week.Meanwhile, Delhi’s 24-hour average air quality index on Sunday was 349, categorised as ‘very poor’ by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). This was a marginal improvement from 374 the previous day.As the air cleared, the visibility in the city also improved.“As predicted, winds in Delhi improved on Sunday and reached up to 15-20 kmph around 11am. With this, visibility also improved to about 2,200-3,000 metres at the Safdarjung and Palam airports. It was about 800 metres in the morning,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist, IMD.The Met department has forecast a further drop in pollution levels in the next two days, with the AQI likely to improve and reach the ‘poor’ zone on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-pollution-mercury-dips-air-quality-improves-marginally-101637520040998.html
22-11-2021||Delhi||Passengers hope relaxed curbs on Delhi Metro will ease crowds at stations||Passengers on the Delhi Metro on Sunday said they hoped the easing of capacity and standing travel caps on the public transit service will ease crowds outside stations, which have been a perennial pain point for commuters since services resumed in September last year.Santosh Kumar, a passenger travelling on the Delhi Metro’s Blue Line (between Dwarka Sector 21 and Noida Electronic City/Vaishali) on Sunday said it was “senseless” for authorities to impose restrictions on the Metro when the entire city is functioning normally, with few curbs in place. “Look at the markets, the streets. The entire city is functioning normally. So, is the Metro the only place where Covid-19 can spread? While the trains were fairly empty, the wait to enter stations and trains was very long. I hope this will ease now,” said Kumar. The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Saturday allowed an additional 30 standing passengers in each Metro coach, along with 100% seating capacity, as a measure to boost the use of public transport in light of the hazardous air pollution levels in the Capital. The Authority also allowed buses to operate with standing passengers for the first time since restrictions were put in place to limit the spread of Covid-19.In buses run by the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) and under the cluster scheme, standing passengers will be allowed at up to 50% of the total seating capacity of each bus. Preety Rajnish (28), said she has to wait at least 20-25 minutes just to enter Rajiv Chowk Metro station while on her way back from her office in Connaught Place. “The more I get delayed due to the Metro, the longer it takes for me to get home. It’s winter and gets dark faster. It would be nice if more passengers can be allowed in the train because it’ll be safer for women like me to reach home on time,” Rajnish said. She added that several passengers stood in the Metro even before the rules were eased, so the decision could have come earlier to save passengers the long waits. HT reached out to the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) for a comment on how this relaxation will help operations, but the agency refused to respond. However, a senior DMRC official, who asked not to be named, said, “The Metro is designed as a mass transit mode, which means it is meant to carry more standing passengers than seated passengers. These restrictions, which have continued for over a year, have impacted revenue. But we hope more relaxations will be allowed in due course. We are already taking all safety precautions inside stations and in trains.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/passengers-hope-relaxed-curbs-on-delhi-metro-will-ease-crowds-at-stations-101637520039852.html

According to police, on October 8, five men barged into the hotel of Mahendra Singh in Sanpka village and fired at him and his brother Ajit Singh, killing the latter on the spot. Ajit ran a transport business, police said.Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police, said on Sunday that the murder was fallout of a rivalry between two groups to dominate the logistics business of an e-commerce company in the area. “The e-commerce company has multiple warehouses in and around the city and has given logistics contracts to different local firms,” he said. On October 17, police had arrested three persons in the case. “A CCTV footage helped police identify the suspects,” Sangwan said. An FIR was registered against five suspects under sections 302 (murder), 307 (attempt to murder), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), and 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Arms Act at Pataudi police station on October 8.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gurugram-two-held-for-murder-of-businessman-in-pataudi-101637519863572.html
22-11-2021||Delhi||Swachh rankings: AAP blames BJP for poor show by Delhi MCDs||New Delhi: The Aam Admi Party has blamed the “misgovernance by the BJP” in the three municipal corporations for the poor performance of the civic bodies in the Swachh Survekshan 2021 rankings released on Saturday. The BJP shot back, saying that the AAP government has starved the corporations of funds and tax allocations which is their operations. North Delhi Municipal Corporation was adjudged the fourth dirtiest area with a population of over a million while the East Delhi Municipal Corporation was in the bottom 10, in this category. South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) was ranked 31st, the same as 2020.AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj on Sunday said that all the three BJP-ruled MCDs have failed disastrously, and have not even been able to make it to the top 20 in the swachh rankings by the central government. “BJP’s MCD is bringing shame to 2 crore people of Delhi. If BJP cannot handle it, then they should leave MCD,” Bharadwaj said. The senior AAP leader alleged that the toilets blocks managed by corporations were maintained only during the survey. “All toilets are locked and are collecting dust. They (the MCDs) don’t have the money to hire people for its maintenance,” he alleged. Bhardwaj, the AAP MLA from Greater Kailash, said the Delhi municipal corporations have brought shame to the capital. “For the last 6 years, they have ensured that Delhi stayed in the list of the dirtiest cities in the country. This is the finding of their own survey. Even if we were to keep aside their other responsibilities of collecting property tax, construction regulation, managing parking and curbing dengue, the MCDs have failed in their basic duty to keep the city clean,” he added. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said there is no doubt that Delhi’s ranking in sanitation survey was not satisfactory, but he blamed Delhi government for the poor results. “Aam Aadmi Party leader Saurabh Bhardwaj levels politically motivated allegations against BJP-ruled MCDs. He has chosen to use the sanitation ranking to attack MCDs, but can he tell how the Delhi government has cooperated with the MCDs to improve sanitation standards in Delhi. Arvind Kejriwal has excessive economic resources yet it (the government) doesn’t allocate full funds to the MCDs,” he said. “The denial of funds, as per 5th Delhi Finance Commission and withholding of funds as per 3rd and 4th finance commission recommendation is affecting the corporations’ sanitation services. MCDs don’t have money to hire new sanitation workers even as many posts in the sanitation department are lying vacant. There is no money either to buy sanitation machines,” Kapoor claimed. He added that despite all these odds municipal sanitation workers try hard to keep Delhi as clean as possible, and that by repeatedly calling Delhi a dirty city, the AAP has insulted their work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/swachh-rankings-aap-blames-bjp-for-poor-show-by-delhi-mcds-101637519859838.html
22-11-2021||Pune||Audit still awaits records of projects approved by PMC||While the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has approved various works and projects on priority using article 72B of the Bombay Provincial Municipal Corporation (BPMC) Act, 1949, the administration has not provided the audit department with records of these works and projects which are necessary for the audit department to make provision for them in next year’s budget. For the audit department to make provision for such works and projects in next year’s budget, various departments of the corporation must provide their names and estimated costs to the audit department. Past experience shows that whenever the administration has failed to provide the audit department with records of such works and projects, the same have not been provided for in the budget of the subsequent year and as a result, have ground to a halt.Citing an example, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) member Vishal Tambe said, “A few years ago, the auditorium on Sinhagad road was approved using article 72B but in the next few years, the standing committee chairman refused to make budgetary provision for the same which is why it is pending till today.”Audit department head Ulka Kalaskar said, “Our department had issued a letter to all department heads and sought information about all such projects that got permission by using article 72B but we haven’t got the required information from the departments till date.”According to sources, municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar recently held a meeting with all the department heads and directed them to first list the projects that were going under article 72B so that the same would be provided for in the regular budget. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, general body meetings did not take place for a long time and various proposals were approved under article 72B. An official on condition of anonymity said that projects worth more than Rs5,000 crore including the 24x7 water project, riverfront development, various flyover works and proposals related to health, were approved using this article.Recently, Congress leader Aba Bagul alleged that the ruling Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) had brought this trend. He said that if the next standing committee chairman were to refuse funding for all such works and projects, it would get difficult for the ruling party.As per article 72B of the Bombay Provincial Municipal Corporation (BPMC) act 1949, the municipal commissioner and general body can use funds on priority for projects that are not planned or do not have budgetary provision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/audit-still-awaits-records-of-projects-approved-by-pmc-101637519740572.html
22-11-2021||Other||No progress on model roads in 34 wards of MCG in Gurugram||In 34 out of 35 municipal wards, the plan of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) to construct model roads is yet to take off. On July 31 this year, during a house meeting of the civic body, councillors and officials unanimously approved an agenda for constructing a model road in each of its 35 municipal wards to improve connectivity in these areas. However, barring ward 31, there has been little to no progress in the remaining 34 wards.Councillors said that MCG officials defer the project whenever they are approached on the matter.“I raised the model road matter during an internal MCG meeting last month. Then I took up the matter with engineering wing officials repeatedly. On each occasion, they either deferred the project or gave a dissatisfactory response,” said Dharmbir, MCG councillor of ward 21.Rama Rathee, councillor of ward 34, said that the model road issue is being ignored by officials.“MCG needs to do a separate meeting with each councillor to finalise a location in their respective wards to build a model road. However, the MCG has not done any separate meeting or initiated a survey on the matter despite repeated requests of councillors. As a result, the project continues to remain on paper,” said Rathee.MCG officials said that they will be taking up the matter with ward councillors next month. “I had decided to take up the matter of model roads last week. But due to illness, I had to defer it. I will be taking up the matter with ward councillors next month and ensure that the finalised designs for model roads cater to all aspects, especially road safety and construction materials that can support a large volume of traffic,” said TL Sharma, chief engineer, MCG.The concept of model roads is not new for the MCG. In November 2018, under the direction of Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, the MCG had finalised five stretches — Hero Honda Chowk-Huda City Centre stretch via Subhash Chowk, Rajiv Chowk-Railway Station (along Old Railway Road), New Railway Road, Mahavir Chowk to Iffco Chowk, and the Sector 4/9-9A dividing road — for developing them as model roads. Exactly a year later, the MCG decided to turn the Vyapar Kendra-Gold Souk Mall stretch and two stretches around South City-1 into model roads.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/no-progress-on-model-roads-in-34-wards-of-mcg-in-gurugram-101637519620276.html
22-11-2021||Delhi||Charge sheet reveals shocking collusion of Rohini jail officers and conman||From receiving more than ₹50 lakh every fortnight in bribe, to blocking view of CCTV cameras by placing bottles, curtains and towels -- the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the Delhi Police has made some shocking revelations on how the Rohini Jail officers helped alleged conman Sukesh Chandrashekhar in running a cheating and extortion racket from inside the prison.This comes days after the Supreme Court expressed displeasure at the “sorry state of affairs” in city’s Tihar jail where at least 32 prison officers have been named in an investigation by Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana into how they helped former Unitech promoters, the Chandra brothers, to operate a “secret underground office in south Delhi” and break other prison rules.
22-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi: With dip in temperature, mosquito breeding and fresh dengue cases go down||After adding more than 2,500 cases last week, the dengue crisis in Delhi is on a downturn due to the fall in temperatures, which has limited mosquito breeding, doctors and health department officials said.A senior public health official from the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC), the nodal agency for vector-borne disease data collection, said studies show a significant dip in mosquito breeding metrics and mosquito density. “The anopheles and aedes aegypti mosquitoes prefer temperatures above 30 degrees Celsius. Once the temperature drops to about 20°C, they become less active in the open and cannot function at temperatures below 10°C,” said the official. The official did, however, voice caution and asked people to be check stagnant water in their vicinity for mosquito breeding. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said Delhi recorded a minimum temperature of 9.8°C on Sunday, which is three notches below normal.The city has so far registered 5,277 dengue cases (the most since 2015), according to the last update issued by the city’s civic bodies on November 13, and nine fatalities of the vector-borne infection. The municipal corporations release weekly dengue data every Monday, recording numbers for the previous week. Authorities have also logged 2,248 cases in which the infection was “acquired from other states” or patients’ addresses could not be traced.Hospitals also said the dengue caseload has dropped over the past week-and-a-half. Dr SP Byotra, senior consultant at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital and chairman of the facility’s department of medicine, said that the number of dengue patients admitted in the hospital has dropped from 70-80 patients three weeks ago to less than 10 patients now. “This can mainly be attributed to environmental factors. But people should continue to take precautions by preventing any water stagnation and wearing full-sleeved clothes,” he said. Dr BK Tripathi, professor in the department of medicine at Safdarjung Hospital, said that the number of new suspected dengue cases is down by over half. “Beside natural factors like a delayed monsoon, we have also observed that diseases like dengue and chikungunya follow a two-three year cycle, after which cases rise significantly. The caseload is likely to fall down next year,” he said.Mosquito breeding detection data from infection hotspots shows that a lack of access to piped water is a major contributing factor to the rise in dengue cases. An analysis of 32 hotspots shows that 58.5% aedes aegyti larvae were found in water storage units such as drums, bucket, jeri cans, and 30.2% in peri-domestic units money plant vas, flower pots, bird-pots etc with smaller contributions from over-head tanks (5.4%), sumps (2.1%) and desert coolers (3.8%).Delhi has this year already registered the most dengue cases since 2015. However, the annual count is likely to increase further at the end of the infection, as a large number of pending cases will be settled by that point. Dengue, malaria and chikungunya were mandated as ‘notified diseases’ in mid-October, making it obligatory for all clinics and hospitals to report them to the state government. As a result of this, a large number of hospitals have reported details about previously unrecorded dengue cases. “Before the notification, 36 hospitals under the ‘sentinel surveillance system’ used to share weekly data with the malaria headquarters. But now, corporations are getting data from 180 healthcare facilities. We are still receiving case details of patients from summer season. All these cases will be adjusted in annual cycle which will increase the annual count,” another senior public health official said.Over the last one decade, Delhi has registered a dengue count higher than the current levels in 2010, 2013 and 2015. During the current year, Delhi had predominance of type II strain of the virus which leads to severe symptoms like haemorrhagic fever with shock. The civic bodies have so far confirmed 9 dengue deaths while several cases remain pending before the audit committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-with-dip-in-temperature-mosquito-breeding-and-fresh-dengue-cases-go-down-101637519499800.html
22-11-2021||Mumbai||Thane Municipal Corporation reaches out to labourers and slum dwellers to get jabbed||The Thane Municipal Corporation’s door-to-door vaccination drive has been a boon for elderly people and labourers in several pockets of the city. TMC has now initiated various such outreach programmes, to cater to labourers waiting at various junctions in the city looking for work and also for those staying in slums or remote parts of the city. Dr Prasad Patil, Immunization officer, TMC, said, “As part of our outreach programme, we have reached out to private office spaces, residential societies, construction sites, slum areas and conducted special vaccination drives.” However, doctors suggest that such initiatives should have started earlier to achieve full first dose of vaccination. TMC medical officer said,”Providing vaccination to such reluctant or hesitant populations at the eleventh hour may not suffice.”For 69-year-old Bhagwan Kheratkar, resident of Namdeowadi in Panchpakhadi, it was only this week that he got his first dose of vaccination. Going to get vaccinated without support was a task as he lost part of his right hand and left leg in an accident. His family was also unaware about the door-to-door vaccination and hence despite his wife and two daughters being fully vaccinated Kheratkar was yet to get his first dose. It was only after a vaccination camp that was set up near his home, that the Kheratkar family availed the door-to-door vaccination facility. “People from the TMC had come to inquire if there are any who are still unvaccinated, they said that the nurse would come and provide vaccination. They also got me registered on the Cowin app and by evening I had the certificate for the first dose with me. As I am under a lot of medications due to my condition my family was skeptical about the effects of vaccination on me. Moreover, I do not go out anywhere so I felt it to be alright to delay vaccination,” said Kheratkar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/thane-municipal-corporation-reaches-out-to-labourers-and-slum-dwellers-to-get-jabbed-101637519441248.html
22-11-2021||Delhi||Schools in Delhi to stay shut till further orders, ban on trucks extended||Schools in Delhi will stay closed “until further orders”, the directorate of education said on Sunday in an official order, and added that online teaching-learning activities and CBSE board examinations will be conducted according to the guidelines issued earlier.The Delhi government on Sunday also extended the ban on the entry of trucks, except those carrying essential items till November 26. All Delhi government and affiliated offices will also continue to allow work from home, the directions said.Senior officials of the Delhi environment department clarified that these orders have been extended based on the directions issued by the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) for Delhi-NCR and adjoining areas on November 16. However, Sunday’s orders will only apply to Delhi as fresh directions are yet to come from the CAQM.On November 13, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced closure of schools for a week in view of the hazardous levels of air pollution, hours after the Supreme Court slammed the state and central governments and ordered them to take “emergent steps” to curb pollution.At an emergency meeting of the national capital region (NCR) states officials, held on the orders of the Supreme Court, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) on Tuesday said that schools in the NCR will stay shut until further notice, and banned the entry of trucks and construction activities in the region.A senior official of the union environment ministry said a review meeting for the CAQM directions for the NCR is scheduled for November 23. “Those directions that were meant to remain in force till November 21 will stop from today (Sunday). Rest will continue. We will review our directions this week,” the official said.No clarity on constructionWhile fresh orders were issued for restrictions on truck movement and work from home for offices, there was no clarity on whether the construction ban in the city will also continue.“The India Meteorological Department has informed us that the air quality is expected to remain in the poor to very poor category in the coming five days, so looking at the forecasts we have decided to extend the ban on entry of trucks into the Capital, and allowed work from home for Delhi government and affiliated offices till November 26. The proposal was sent to the Lieutenant Governor for approval, and we received the sanction on Sunday,” a senior environment department official said.Uncertainty over schools continuesAfter CAQM’s Tuesday order, schools in Delhi have returned to online classes while uncertainty prevails over the resumption of regular in-person classes. Schools in the Capital were closed for physical classes on account of Covid-19 last March and allowed to reopen in a limited way for students of higher grades earlier this year. They finally reopened for all classes on November 1 but were shut again on November 13 on account of a spike in pollution.Sudha Acharya, the chairperson of the National Progressive School Conference (NPSC) which has 122 Delhi schools as members, including Sardar Patel Vidyalaya, Bal Bharati Public School, Springdales School, Sanskriti School, Delhi Public Schools, Ahlcon International School, and Amity International School, said that schools had been thrust into uncertainty once again.Acharya said parents had been calling the school and enquiring about the resumption of classes since many institutions outside Delhi were resuming classes from Monday. “We are getting a lot of queries from parents since we need to hold exams for students in classes 9 and 11. We don’t know how to conduct the exams at a time when schools have been closed abruptly without any clarity on reopening,” said Acharya, principal of ITL Public School, Dwarka.Former NPSC chairperson Malini Narayanan, who is also the principal of Army Public School in Shankar Vihar, said parents were disappointed due to the closure of schools and one could not understand the reason behind the closure. “How is it that schools seem to be the cause of pollution all the time? Closure of schools is becoming the answer to every problem. Our parents and children are also disappointed,” said Narayanan.Narayanan said that the closure had set back the school’s academic cycle and affected other services such as transport and canteen facilities. “We were geared up for the resumption of bus services and canteen facility. The school has incurred expenditure on these fronts but now we are unsure about the reopening which is unfortunate,” said Narayanan.Anticipating closure due to cold-wave conditions in winter, she said the closure of schools was never-ending. “In January, schools are asked to shut down due to fog. Due to some reason or the other, the closure has schools seems to be getting extended,” said Narayanan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/schools-in-delhi-to-stay-shut-till-further-orders-ban-on-trucks-extended-101637519139780.html
22-11-2021||Mumbai||BMC: May take call on shutting few Covid facilities post December||Although the rate of Covid-19 bed occupancy has dropped significantly in Mumbai, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is treading cautiously when it comes to shutting down the facilities erected for the Covid-19 patients. The civic body has said that it will wait till the end of the year to take a final call on shutting a few Covid-19 isolation facilities and treatment centres.According to the BMC dashboard, Mumbai has a capacity to accommodate 17,434 Covid-19 patients in all the hospital beds, out of which 16,273 (93%) of them are vacant and 1,161 are occupied. After the pandemic broke out, the BMC had set up a three tier bed system for the patients, which included Covid Care Centre -1 (CCC-1) located in hotels, halls and lodges, CCC-2 facilities in government centres with available doctors and nurses round-the-clock and Dedicated Covid Health Centres (DCHC).Additional municipal commissioner and in-charge of public health Suresh Kakani told HT, “We have instructed hospitals that having only one ward would do for now as the cases have started to go down. Earlier, there used to be several Covid-19 wards in BMC and government hospitals and now these resources will be transferred to the non-Covid wards.”He also mentioned that in the Jumbo Centres the number of active beds have also been reduced. Kakani said that each jumbo centre used to have as many as ten wards with 200-250 bed capacity in each of them for Covid patients. Now, there are 250-400 active Covid-19 beds in each of these jumbo centres depending on the demand and situation of the nearby municipal wards.“While we have reduced the bed capacity we are not completely dismantling these facilities right now. The month of December is going to be crucial with Christmas and new year to take place. We will be studying the situation and may take a call at the end of December or early January,” he said.A senior BMC official requesting anonymity said that at the ward level many of the CCC facilities have been shut down temporarily and the available resources are being reserved as a buffer in case there is any need in the future if the fresh Covid-19 wave hits. Earlier this year, the BMC standing committee had passed a resolution to appoint private contractors for maintenance of these beds. Sunita Rajesh Mehta - BJP corporator and a member of BMC Health Committee said that it’s too early to dismantle the available beds of the Covid Care Facilities.“There are still cases coming and many people are yet to complete their vaccination. The BMC has spent a lot of money in tackling the pandemic so far and if things go bad again then they will have to reconstruct these facilities again which will cost more,” Mehta said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/brihanmumbai-municipal-corporation-may-shut-covid-care-centres-post-dec-in-mumbai-101637514342517.html
22-11-2021||Lucknow||Former UP chief secretary advocates reward and punishment for civil servants||Former Uttar Pradesh (UP) chief secretary Alok Ranjan on Sunday advocated a system of reward and punishment for civil servants.He was speaking at the launch of his book, Making a Difference The IAS as a Career, at Jaipuria Institute of Management in Lucknow.“There should be a system of reward and punishment for civil servants to promote excellence and deter corruption,” the former UP chief secretary said.“Currently, there is no system to reward or punish civil servants which affects output. If such a system (of reward and punishment) is developed, where officers are rewarded for their excellence, then most civil servants will strive to give their best,” Alok Ranjan said while answering a question about the working of civil servants.The former UP chief secretary also raises the issue in his book while discussing how decision-making is delayed in the name of following procedures.“I found that officers avoid decision making or take shelter of procedures, queries and asking for more information in an effort to protect themselves. There is a tendency now to keep looking over the shoulder to see how CAG, CBI or CVC will view a decision,” writes Alok Ranjan in the chapter titled The Chief Secretary: Leader of the State Bureaucracy.He went on to suggest, “Corruption is not only to be condemned but acted upon strongly. However, systems need to be evolved which will protect an honest officer who takes decision in public interest.”Alok Ranjan, who served as the chief secretary in the previous Akhilesh Yadav government in Uttar Pradesh, shared his first-hand experience as a civil servant in the book meant for IAS aspirants and those interested in the know-how of bureaucracy. Former bureaucrats Naveen Chandra Bajpai, Atul Gupta, along with Surabhi Modi Sahai and Arvind Mohan, also participated in a discussion moderated by Jayant Krishna, during the launch event that was attended by several retired and serving bureaucrats and other dignitaries.Writing about his years as the chief secretary, Ranjan points out how planning, monitoring and political will can make huge projects come to reality.Sharing details about some of the most ambitious projects during the previous government, the former UP chief secretary writes, “The developers (of Lucknow-Agra Expressway) were talking of a minimum period of thirty-six months to complete this project. It was made clear that no more than twenty-four months would be allowed and this was further reduced to twenty-two months by the chief minister (Akhilesh Yadav) at the time of the launching.”In his book, he also suggests, “Media responses enable you to look at yourself in the mirror. If you take it positively, then both your image and that of the government shall improve. The media reactions represent the voice of the people which must be heard.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/former-uttar-pradesh-chief-secretary-advocates-system-of-reward-and-punishment-for-civil-servants-101637513919472.html
22-11-2021||Delhi||What’s it like to live in the most polluted pockets of Delhi?||For 35-year-old Rajesh Devi, pollution is a clear and present danger but despite knowing that it was taking a toll on her, she continues to travel from her house in Mundka to a factory where she works as a seamstress because, according to her, if she would stop, her family will starve.Dhruv Sinha of Dwarka Sector 8 has confined the movement of his 74-year-old father to a room despite his doctor’s advising a daily walk to keep the septugenarian’s diabetes in control. Every winter, Sinha used to send his father to his native in Bihar to escape high levels of air pollution in the Capital.Thirty-six-year-old Mumtaz, a resident of Bawana, has developed tuberculosis. Her doctor’s say that prolonged exposure to extreme air pollution levels is one of the primary reasons behind her condition.The parents of Dhriti, 7, and Arunima. 12, in Chandni Chowk have told them to give up on their outdoor games, and play video games instead, since October so that they are protected from pollutants in the air.Sagar Raj, a resident of Anand Vihar, says despite his locality consistently coming up in the list of most polluted neighbourhoods, the government authorities have done little over the years to address the issue. Raj says they were completely at the mercy of home air purifiers.Several neighbourhoods in Delhi record much higher levels of pollution than the daily average index value indicates. For instance, between November 1 and 21, Delhi recorded its average AQI in the severe zone (between 400-500) for 8 days, compared to 14 severe days in Anand Vihar and 11 such days in Bawana.This, doctors say, entails heavy costs in terms of health for the residents of these areas. “As doctors, we see the impacts of pollution on people firsthand, especially on the more vulnerable sections like senior citizens and children. In many health issues you might not see an immediate impact of pollution exposure but in more chronic cases, pollution does play a role in deteriorating a patient’s condition,” said Arvind Kumar, founder of Lung Care Foundation and chairperson of the Institute of Chest Surgery, Chest Onco Surgery and Lung Transplantation.Weather forecasters and scientists have time and again pointed out that besides working on long-term and immediate measures to curb pollution levels in the city, the authorities must ensure area-specific plans and monitoring since every neighbourhood profile in the capital is different, and has different kinds of local sources of pollution. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment said, “While Delhi needs to work on a holistic pollution control plan for the entire city, it is also imperative that there is a local action plan as well. This is because the pollution sources in each area are different. The landfill smoke and open garbage burning is not as big a problem in central and south Delhi as it is in the outer districts,” she said.Over the last two weeks, Hindustan Times spoke to residents of Mundka, Bawana, Anand Vihar, Dwarka Sector 8 and Chandni Chowk, which reported the highest pollution levels since Diwali among the 39 areas where air quality is monitoredby central, local and scientific agencies.Most of the residents that HT spoke to mentioned that despite the fact that the authorities know the exact months when pollution levels start rising, only “cosmetic” emergency measures are taken each year instead of a long-term action plan which works round the year.Delhi government initiated several measures such as shutting of schools and construction activities in the city on November 13, a day when the Supreme Court slammed both the state and central governments for doing little to control pollution in Delhi NCR and blaming the farmers for burning stubble, instead.The court also ordered the NCR state governments to hold an emergency meeting, following which on November 17, the federal anti-pollution agency, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) week-long measures across NCR such as shutting of schools, work from home for government staff and banning construction. However, most these steps were being implemented half heartedly, as meteorological factors such as improved wind speed coming to the rescue of the citizens and clearing air of pollutants to some extent.HT finds how is it like to live in five of one of the most polluted residential pockets in the national Capital..Mundka (highest average AQI in November: 493 )Thirty five-year-old Rajesh Devi, who works as a seamstress in the Mundka industrial area, and lives in the area, said if people like her start sitting at home fearing pollution, then her children will starve to death.She said wearing whites is also a privilege for the residents here, because the toxic chemicals from industries, open garbage fires and the dust from unpaved roads, turn them pale yellow soon.“The haze you see, you might find it unusual, but for us this is our everyday reality. You can ask any woman here, after one or two months, the white shirts of the school uniforms turn yellow. To mask it, I dip my kids’ uniforms in neel powder (indigo powder), but my daughter hates that because it makes her shirts blue. But that’s the only way these clothes will last a few years. We do not have the money to keep buying new uniforms every year,” said Devi.Mundka, an industrial area located in west Delhi, is among the 13 pollution hot spots that the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) recognized in 2018. Despite claims of focussed pollution control efforts, this locality has continued to top the list of the most polluted pockets of the Capital. On November 12, when Delhi’s AQI spiked to 471, the average AQI of Mundka had escalated to 493.Naresh Kumar, a Congress leader who is familiar with the locality, said the condition of roads in the rural areas, including Mundka, is extremely bad and this is also adding to the pollution in the area.“The mechanical sweepers and water sprinklers are reserved for the VIPs in Lutyens’ Delhi, the government and the municipal agencies have not bothered to deploy any pollution control measures here. Are the residents here not human beings? Or are their lungs made of steel?” asked Kumar.Dwarka sector-8 (highest average AQI in November: 470)Till Covid-19 pandemic hit the country, Dhruv Sinha, a resident of Dwarka Sector -8, would send his 74-year-old father, Brij Mohan Sinha, to his native town in Bihar every year in winters when the pollution levels in the national capital enters emergency levels, and remain consistently high for weeks.For the past two years, the Brij Mohan has to stay confined to his room with an air purifier despite doctors advising him go for a daily walk to keep his diabetes under control.“My father has not stepped out of the house since Diwali because of the high pollution levels. He gets cranky and depressed staying at home 24x7, because he is used to meeting his friends for evening walks. But our family doctor advised that going out in such high pollution levels might do his health more harm than good,” said Dhruv.Sumegha Sharma, a resident of Dwarka sector-10, and an environmental activist who has been working in the area for over five years now, explained that the pollution levels in Dwarka, despite being a largely residential area, remain high primarily because of various construction projects going on in the sub-city and also because of open waste dumping and burning.“Waste burning is a major pollution source in Dwarka. Since many plots are vacant, people have turned it into convenient garbage dumping points, and every few days it is set on fire after dark. The area is also developing, so many construction projects are ongoing and the AQI here tends to be higher than the rest of the city. Despite very specific issues, which are known to the authorities here, no action has been taken so far,” she said.AQI recordings over the last two days show that even on days when the average air quality of the city has improved to the upper end of very poor category, Dwarka was among the areas that continued to remain in the severe zone. For instance, on Sunday at 2pm, the average AQI of Delhi was 371, considered in the very poor zone on CPCB’s AQI scale, but the pollution levels at Dwarka was 401, in the severe range.Bawana (highest average AQI in November: 483)When 36-year-old Mumtaz moved to Delhi with her husband over 15 years ago, she had hopes of a better life from what she had back in her village in Uttar Pradesh. She planned to set up a small shop of beauty products while her husband earning a steady income from his work.But life took a turn for the worse for her in 2017, when she was diagnosed with tuberculosis. The doctors at the local government hospital told her that the prolonged exposure to the pollutants at the factory where she worked could be one of the reasons behind her disease.“It could be that or someone from the workforce had it and transmitted it to me, because the workspace where we all work is very small. It took me a year to completely recover, but even now I find it difficult to breathe on certain days. I feel tightness in my chest. Now I think that life back in our village was better, at least we could have clean air and drinking water,” said Mumtaz.A study titled, ‘Association Between Ambient Air Pollution and Elevated Risk of Tuberculosis Development’, conducted in Taiwan in 2019 highlighted broad-scale evidence showing the significant association between ambient air pollutants and the development of tuberculosis (TB). The study showed that short and long term exposures to particulate matters with aerodynamic diameters less than 10ug/m3 (PM10) and 2.5ug/m3 (PM2.5), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOX), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) are highly likely to be associated with the elevated risk of TB.Doctors back home have also highlighted the health risks associated with exposure to such high levels of pollution.Dr Rajesh Chawla, senior consultant of pulmonary and critical care at Indraprastha Apollo hospital, said that there was nearly a 20% increase in the number of patients coming in with exacerbations of their chronic respiratory conditions around Diwali this year.Chandni Chowk (highest average AQI in November: 492)Every day exactly at 5pm, seven-year-old Dhriti and her 12-year-old sister Arunima, leave whatever they are doing and sit before the television set to play video games for an hour. Till October, this was the time that they ran outside to play with their friends in the neighbourhood park, but because of the high pollution levels they have been confined to their house.“We bought them this video game set last year after Covid-19 pandemic, when they could not go outside and play. Children also need some entertainment. For one hour every day, we allow them to play video games, after which they have to go back to their homework or reading a book or any other chore,” said Sumitra Vishwas, Dhriti and Arunima’s mother, a resident of Chandni Chowk’s Gupta Residency.Many like the Vishwas family are concerned that the high pollution levels in the national capital could ruin the health and quality of life for their children. They said children are forced to stay cooped up at home, instead of freely running around and playing with their friends in the park.“You would see many children playing around in the local parks here in the evening, but on days when the pollution levels are high the number of those who venture outside is very less. You do not need any monitoring equipment; you can see the haze in the air. Who would want to subject their children to such toxic air? It is better to keep them safe,” said Mohammad Irshad, a resident of Daryaganj.Senior Delhi Pollution Control Committee officials said the pollution levels around Chandni Chowk are showing a rising trend this season because of multiple development activities going on in the area.“You have the some road repair work going on in Chandni Chowk area, plus in less than five kilometre radius you also have the other construction work going on at the Pragati Maidan,” a senior official said.The children in the area have also become more aware of the need for a partnership between citizens and governments so that Delhi’s air can be improved.“We are taught in school how Delhi is the most polluted capitals in the world. It is definitely the government’s responsibility but everyone in Delhi, including children like us need to do our bit as well. We can plant more trees in our areas and tell our parents to avoid private cars and take the Metro instead. This will be our contribution towards making our own future better,” said 16-year-old Sayali Parashar, a resident of the area.Anand Vihar (highest average AQI in November: 486)Anand Vihar, which located right at the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border, has been suffering from a locational disadvantage from years. While known as a transport hub, the area also has many residential complexes. The residents in these areas said that several complaints to shift the transport hubs to the outskirts of the Capital have been ignored by the government.“Despite being one of the most polluted locations of the city, no government agency has bothered to take any significant pollution control measures in this area. Recently a smog tower was installed here, but we are not very sure how much filtering of air is happening because of it,” said Sagar Raj a resident of Gitanjali Apartments, which is barely four kilometres away from the Anand Vihar bus terminal.Many older residents in his society prefer to move to their children’ houses to escape the winter pollution, Raj said.“The filters of my air purifiers need to be changed every year, because it gets choked. According to the company representatives, it needs changing only after three-four years in Indian cities. Imagine if the air purifier filters are getting to choked, what this pollution is doing to our lungs,” he added.A senior DPCC official said that they have created a list of localities apart from the 13 major pollution hotspots, where action is being tightened.“We made a list of 150 localities within these 13 hotspots and other areas where there were specific pollution problems. We have ordered the agencies to tackle these problems and submit regular reports to us,” the official said.Jogi Ram Jain, standing committee chairperson of the north Delhi municipal corporation said that they are making all efforts to minimise pollution levels in the city.“We have started 24x7 patrolling of our areas and special teams have been made for this purpose. We are also following all directions of the pollution monitoring agencies and conducting regular water sprinkling and sweeping of roads to control dust levels,” Jain said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/whats-it-like-to-live-in-the-most-polluted-pockets-of-delhi-101637513558848.html
22-11-2021||Mumbai||50% of fines collected from Mumbaiites for not wearing masks to go for civic works: BMC||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) will utilise half of the ₹64.11 crore collected from penalising 3.1 million people for not wearing a mask on development works and health services, among others. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said 50% of this amount is being streamlined to BMC’s common fund, which is used for various development projects and Covid-related expenses. He also said that the remaining 50% of the money is being used to pay the agencies that supply marshals to BMC.“Instead of paying direct salaries to the marshals and their agencies, we have offered half of the fine money to them as payment. At present, there are 12 agencies appointed by BMC and each of them is being given the responsibility of deploying marshals in two municipal wards,” Kakani added.In 2020, BMC deployed its officials for collecting fines and paid 10% of the daily fine amount as an incentive to employees and their departments. “The remaining money is being used in development works across departments just like how we use the money from property tax and water bills,” he said.Besides this, the BMC data also shows an additional ₹13.26 crore has been collected by Mumbai Police from citizens for not wearing masks. Kakani added that 50% of this amount will be transferred to the Mumbai Police Welfare Fund and the remaining is being deposited in BMC’s common kitty.He further said that the idea of imposing penalties was not about generating revenue and the fine amount in Mumbai is much less as compared to the other parts of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/50-of-fines-collected-from-mumbaiites-for-not-wearing-masks-to-go-for-civic-works-101637506540983.html

22-11-2021||World||2019 Lanka Easter Sunday terror attack: Ex-police chief indicted charged with criminal negligence||Sri Lanka's former police chief Pujith Jayasundera was on Monday indicted with 855 charges of criminal negligence for failing to act despite receiving prior intelligence warnings in the 2019 Easter Sunday terror attack that killed nearly 270 people, including 11 Indians.The Attorney General read out the charges when the case was taken up before a three-judge High Court bench comprising Justices Namal Balalle, Aditya Patabendige and Mohamed Irshadeen on Monday.A total of 855 charges of criminal negligence were levelled against Jayasundera, who pleaded not guilty.Jayasundera was present in the courtroom when the charges were read out against him in the case, which has over 1,200 witnesses, lawyers said.His lawyers insisted that the former Inspector General was not guilty of ignoring prior intelligence.Former defence secretary Hemasiri Fernando, who was a key member in the defence ministry when the attack took place in April 2019, also faces similar charges.Jayasundera and Fernando were suspended from service and arrested in connection with the case.However, they were later released on bail.Both were accused by the then President Maithripala Sirisena for negligence over alleged inaction to prevent attacks despite the availability of prior intelligence on the attacks.Police have filed over 23,000 charges against suspects for conspiring, aiding and abetting the attacks.Nine suicide bombers belonging to local Islamist extremist group National Thawheed Jamaat (NTJ) linked to ISIS carried out a series of devastating blasts that tore through three churches and as many luxury hotels on April 21, 2019, killing nearly 270 people, and injuring over 500.The attack stirred a political storm as the then government headed by President Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was blamed for its inability to prevent the attacks despite prior intelligence being made available.During his tenure, Sirisena formed a presidential panel to probe the attacks.The special presidential probe found Sirisena himself along with a host of other top defence officials, including Fernando and Jayasundera, guilty of ignoring prior intelligence.The panel report had recommended criminal action against them.The Catholic Church in Sri Lanka had repeatedly expressed dissatisfaction over the Easter Sunday terror attack investigations undertaken by the government.It has demanded action against those named in the report for their negligence to stop the attacks despite having prior intelligence.On a day when Jayasundera and Fernando had a torrent of charges levelled against them, leading Catholic priest Rev Father Cyril Gamini visited the Criminal Investigation Department to record his statement.He visited the CID for the third day as he was summoned to appear before them.Earlier this month, Gamini had filed a fundamental rights application fearing a possible arrest for questioning the involvement of the Sri Lankan state intelligence operatives in the Easter attack.On Sunday, members of the Catholic community held protests in remembrance of the people who had lost their lives in the attack .They appealed to the Sri Lankan government to ensure speedy justice and allow trials to be conducted with undue political interference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2019-lanka-easter-sunday-terror-attack-ex-police-chief-indicted-charged-with-criminal-negligence-101637598813585.html

The meeting was also attended by foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Pakistan Army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa and National Security Adviser Moeed Yousaf. Khan “announced Pakistan’s decision to allow the 50,000 MT of wheat India has offered to provide Afghanistan as humanitarian assistance to go through Pakistan as soon as modalities are finalized with the Indian side,” according to an official statement issued after the meeting.“Pakistan will also facilitate the return of Afghan patients who had gone to India for medical treatment and are stuck there, the Prime Minister announced,” the statement added.Hundreds of Afghan nationals, including patients seeking medical treatment and their relatives or attendants, have been stuck in India for months following the Taliban takeover in Afghanistan in mid-August.In recent weeks, some of them made their way back to Afghanistan via Iran on a handful of specially arranged flights. However, the fare for this route was $850 and out of the reach of many of the stranded Afghans.India offered to supply the 50,000 tonnes of wheat as humanitarian aid via the Wagah land border crossing with Pakistan several weeks ago. However, Pakistan did not respond positively to the move, Indian officials have said.Even a Taliban delegation that recently visited Islamabad had raised the issue of allowing the shipment of the wheat with the top Pakistani leadership.During the meeting in Islamabad, Khan instructed all Pakistani ministries to “facilitate Afghans to the maximum”. He ordered the immediate shipment of in-kind humanitarian assistance worth Pakistani ₹5 billion, including 50,000 tonnes of wheat, emergency medical supplies, winter shelters and other items. He also approved in-principle tariff and sales tax reduction on key Afghan exports to Pakistan.Khan also ordered authorities to continue providing free Covid-19 vaccination for all Afghans entering Pakistan from land borders. Pakistan started free vaccination of Afghans on November 13. NSA Moeed Yusuf, who is also the convener of the cell, made a presentation on the current economic situation in Afghanistan and the progress made by the cell in coordinating Pakistani efforts for humanitarian assistance and border facilitation for Afghans.Khan instructed Yusuf to visit Afghanistan to “hold delegation-level talks and agree on specific areas where immediate capacity-building support shall be provided to Afghans”, the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/khan-allows-indian-aid-to-afghanistan-to-pass-through-pak-once-modalities-are-finalised-101637593307976.html
22-11-2021||World||Was SUV driver in Wisconsin parade crash fleeing a crime?||Investigators are looking into whether the SUV driver who plowed through a Christmas parade in suburban Milwaukee, killing at least five people and injuring more than 40, was fleeing from a crime, a law enforcement official told The Associated Press.The joyous scene of marching bands and children dancing in Santa hats and waving pompoms turned deadly in an instant on Sunday, as the SUV sped through barricades and struck dancers, musicians and others.One video showed a woman screaming, “Oh my God!” repeatedly as a group of young dancers was struck. A father talked of going “from one crumpled body to the other” in search of his daughter. Members of a “Dancing Grannies” club were among those killed.One person was taken into custody after a Waukesha police officer opened fire to try to stop the vehicle, authorities said.Investigators were questioning the person about an earlier crime, which the official described to AP as an argument involving a knife. The official, who cautioned the investigation was still in the early stages, was not authorized to discuss the case publicly and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.Waukesha Police Chief Dan Thompson gave no immediate details about the person in custody or any possible motive.Thompson said that he did not know if the driver was hit by the officer’s bullets but that no bystanders were wounded.On its social media account, the city of Waukesha put the number of dead at at least five.The horror was recorded by the city’s livestream and onlookers' cellphones. One video shows the moment the SUV broke through the barricades and the sound of what apparently were several gunshots.Another video shows a young child dancing in the street as the SUV speeds by, just a few feet from her, before it hurtles into parade participants a few hundred feet ahead. One video, of dancers with pompoms, ends with a group of people tending to a girl on the ground.“There were pompoms and shoes and spilled hot chocolate everywhere. I had to go from one crumpled body to the other to find my daughter,” Corey Montiho, a Waukesha school district board member, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. “My wife and two daughters were almost hit. Please pray for everybody. Please pray.”The Milwaukee Dancing Grannies posted on its Facebook page that some of its members were among the dead. The organization describes itself as a “group of grannies that meet once a week to practice routines for summer and winter parades.”“Our group was doing what they loved, performing in front of crowds in a parade putting smiles on faces of all ages, filling them with joy and happiness,” the post said.“Those who died were extremely passionate Grannies. Their eyes gleamed ... joy of being a Grannie. They were the glue ... held us together.”A Roman Catholic priest, parishioners and Waukesha Catholic schoolchildren were among those injured, the Archdiocese of Milwaukee said.Chris Germain, co-owner of the Aspire Dance Center studio, had about 70 people in the parade, including children as young as 2 being pulled in wagons and participants up to 18 years old.Germain, whose 3-year-old daughter was in the parade, said he was driving at the head of their entry when he saw a maroon SUV that “just blazed right past us.” A police officer ran past in chase. Germain said he jumped out of his own SUV and gathered the girls who were with him to safety.Then he walked forward to see the damage.“There were small children laying all over the road. There were police officers and EMTs doing CPR on multiple members of the parade,” he said.Angelito Tenorio, a West Allis alderman who is running for Wisconsin state treasurer, said he was watching the parade with his family when they saw the SUV come speeding into the area.“Then we heard a loud bang,” Tenorio said. “And after that, we just heard deafening cries and screams from the crowd, from the people at the parade. And people started rushing, running away with tears in their eyes, crying.”The Waukesha school district canceled classes Monday and said extra counselors would be on hand for students and staff. The parade’s list of participants included cheer, dance and band entries associated with district schools.Gov. Tony Evers said he and his wife were “praying for Waukesha tonight and all the kids, families, and community members affected by this senseless act.”The parade, held each year on the Sunday before Thanksgiving, is sponsored by the city’s Chamber of Commerce. This year’s event, the 59th, had the theme of “comfort and joy.”Waukesha is a western suburb of Milwaukee, and about 55 miles (90 kilometers) north of Kenosha, where Kyle Rittenhouse was acquitted Friday of charges stemming from the fatal shooting of two men and the wounding of a third during unrest in that city in August 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/was-suv-driver-in-wisconsin-parade-crash-fleeing-a-crime-101637592023356.html

This does not speak well of the relations between our nations,” Duterte said.Duterte was referring to the actions of three Chinese coast guard vessels that is said to have blocked and used water cannon on resupply boats headed towards a Philippine-occupied atoll in the sea.The United States called the Chinese actions “dangerous, provocative and unjustified” and warned that an armed attack on Philippine vessels would invoke US mutual defence commitments, a Reuters report said.Speaking at the summit, Xi said: “We need to pursue dialogue instead of confrontation, build partnerships instead of alliances. China firmly opposes hegemonism and power politics. China will never seek hegemony, still less bully smaller countries.”China’s sweeping claims of sovereignty over the SCS has set it against Asean members Vietnam and the Philippines while Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan, which Beijing claims as a breakaway region, are also part of the ongoing dispute.Announcing the “comprehensive strategic partnership”, Xi Jinping said it was “...a new milestone in the history of our relations and will inject new impetus into peace, stability, prosperity and development of our region and the world”.“China supports Asean’s efforts to build a nuclear weapons-free zone and is prepared to sign the Protocol to the Treaty on the Southeast Asia Nuclear Weapon-Free Zone as soon as possible,” Xi said.China is ready to provide with another $1.5 billion in development assistance in the next three years to support Asean countries’ fight against Covid-19 and economic recovery, Xi said.The summit was held without a representative from Myanmar, reports said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-not-a-bully-does-not-seek-hegemony-xi-jinping-tells-asean-leaders-101637578666225.html
22-11-2021||World||China’s hypersonic missile shows Xi's interest in launching orbital strikes||China fired a missile from a hypersonic weapon as it approached a target during a test in July, the Financial Times reported, adding the Pentagon was surprised because no nation was known to have the capability.A hypersonic glide vehicle launched by China fired the projectile over the South China Sea while moving at five times the speed of sound, the newspaper reported, citing people familiar with the intelligence.Some military experts believe an air-to-air missile was fired, the newspaper said. Others thought it was a countermeasure that could hurt the ability of missile defense systems to knock out the hypersonic weapon, which can carry a nuclear warhead, in a battle.The Financial Times reported last month that China conducted hypersonic weapons tests on July 27 and again on Aug. 13, raising concern in Washington about Beijing’s advancing military capabilities. China’s Foreign Ministry said in October the nation had tested “a routine spacecraft” to see if it was reusable, an assertion ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian repeated Monday at a regular press briefing in Beijing.In an apparent effort to dismiss the idea the spacecraft launched anything, Zhao added: “After separating from the spacecraft before its return, the supporting devices will burn up when they are falling in the atmosphere.”If China’s tests of hypersonic weapons are confirmed, it would suggest that President Xi Jinping may be exploring orbital strikes as a way to counter American advancements in shooting down ballistic missiles before they can threaten the US homeland. Last year, the US Navy successfully intercepted a mock intercontinental ballistic missile.“I certainly can’t think of any technical precedent to a hypersonic glide vehicle releasing some sort of payload -- implied to be a missile by the FT story,” said Ankit Panda, the Stanton senior fellow in the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “I do wonder, however, if this ‘missile’ may have been some other sort of payload, perhaps a countermeasure or some other sort of support mechanism,” he said. Panda added there are questions about the military utility of such a demonstration, and the international community shouldn’t assume China intends to deploy such a weapon in the field.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-hypersonic-missile-shows-xi-s-interest-in-launching-orbital-strikes-101637572515610.html

The protesters also demanded the restoration of Hong Kong’s greater autonomy curbed by China’s implementation of the draconian national security law in the global financial hub. They held banners which read ‘Free Hong Kong’, ‘Fight for freedom’, ‘Stand with HK’.The organisers said the protest was a great success as people in large numbers gathered at the venue.China has long been accused of violating human rights and stifling dissenting voices. It is also facing allegations of trying to hide the early data related to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. Former US secretary of state Mike Pompeo also joined growing calls for a boycott of the Beijing Winter Olympics next year."The CCP has disappeared reporters writing about Wuhan virus, docs telling the truth about CCP labs, a prof tennis player, Uighurs, Hong Kongers & the head of Interpol. Let's disappear the Olympics from them and hold it in a place the world can be proud of. #BoycottBeijingOlympics," Pompeo tweeted.The call for a boycott has gained momentum after US President Joe Biden recently said his administration was considering a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. Biden was asked about the possibility of a boycott during his meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The US president indicated that the boycott could be on the card as he said it was “something we are considering.”A diplomatic boycott means the White House won’t be sending a delegation for the opening and closing ceremonies. The athletes, however, would attend the event.Reports suggest that the United Kingdom is also actively discussing the possibility of not sending officials to the Beijing Winter Olympics.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/friends-of-canada-india-protest-against-beijing-winter-olympics-in-vancouver-101637562974810.html

A father talked of going “from one crumpled body to the other” in search of his daughter. Members of a “Dancing Grannies” club were among those hit.The city of Waukesha posted on its social media accounts late Sunday that it could confirm at least five died and more than 40 were injured, while noting that it was still collecting information. The city's statement also noted that many people took themselves to hospitals. The city did not release any additional information about those who died.A “person of interest” was in custody, Waukesha Police Chief Dan Thompson said, but he gave no details about the person or any possible motive. The investigation was ongoing, with assistance from the Wisconsin Department of Justice.“What took place in Waukesha today is sickening, and I have every confidence that those responsible will be brought to justice,” Attorney General Josh Kaul, the state’s top law enforcement officer, tweeted.The horror was recorded by the city’s livestream and onlookers' cellphones. One video shows the moment the SUV broke through the barricades and the sound of what appears to be several gunshots. Thompson said a Waukesha police officer fired his gun to try to stop the vehicle.

Auckland, which is the epicentre of the outbreak, will start at red.Ardern said about 83% of eligible New Zealanders are fully vaccinated now and if all those people who are due for their second shot get it, that number would rise to 88%.The government previously said the country would drop lockdown measures and move into the new traffic-light system to manage outbreaks after 90% of the eligible population was fully vaccinated.New Zealand enforced some of the tightest pandemic restrictions among OECD nations that has helped limit the spread of Covid-19 so far and helped the economy bounce back faster than many of its peers.The country has so far reported about 7,000 cases in all and 39 deaths. Its international borders still remain shut to the rest of the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-to-end-tough-covid-curbs-adopt-new-virus-fighting-system-from-dec-101637557607984.html
22-11-2021||World||Australia to reopen to fully vaccinated foreign visa holders from December 1||Australia will allow foreign visa holders to enter the country from the start of December, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Monday, the latest step to restart international travel and support its economy.Australia shut its international border in May 2020 and allowed only restricted numbers of citizens and permanent residents to enter in a bid to curtail the spread of Covid-19.The rules were relaxed in recent weeks to allow foreign family members of citizens to enter, and Morrison said this will be scaled up from Dec. 1 to allow vaccinated students, business visa holders and refugees to arrive."The return of skilled workers and students to Australia is a major milestone in our pathway back," Morrison told reporters in Canberra. Australia will also allow in vaccinated tourists from South Korea and Japan from Dec 1, he said.The return of foreign students, who are worth about A$35 billion ($25 billion) a year to the Australian economy, will be a major boost for the education sector.More than 235,000 foreigners, including about 160,000 students, held visas for Australia at the end of October, government data showed.Many Australian universities have come to rely on foreign students, who make up about 21% of total enrolments, and the border closure led higher education facilities to lay off hundreds of staff.Many students locked out of Australia have said they would switch to alternative universities if they were unable to begin face-to-face learning in 2022.The relaxation of the border rules is also expected to ease labour shortages, which threaten to stymie an economic rebound."This will be critical relief for businesses who are struggling to find workers just to keep their doors open and for those who need highly specialised skills to unlock big projects," said Jennifer Westacott, chief executive of the industry body, the Business Council.Border rules, swift lockdowns and tough social distancing rules helped Australia to keep its coronavirus numbers far lower than many other comparable countries, with around 200,000 cases and 1,948 deaths.Most new infections are being reported in Victoria state, which logged 1,029 cases on Monday.

The fishermen were not able to earn their livelihood as big trawlers were allowed for fishing at Makran Coast,” he said at a public meeting last month.Rehman said despite building the Gwadar Deep Sea Port, the people of the city were still jobless and the government has done nothing about it."It is an insult for the sons of soil when they are stopped at checkpoints and inquired about their whereabouts," he was quoted as saying by The Express Tribune.The protests are part of growing discontent with China’s presence in Gwadar, whose port is an integral part of the USD 60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor project (CPEC), the flagship project of China's multi-billion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).India has protested to China over the CPEC as it traverses through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). The massive infrastructure project connects China's Xinjiang province with Gwadar port in Pakistan's Balochistan province.Gwadar port has long been portrayed as the jewel in the CPEC crown, but in the process, the city has become the very embodiment of a security state.The authorities’ priorities are geared towards securing the port and its ancillary interests; the welfare of those for whom the area is home counts for little. Far from the port being a harbinger of an economic boom, the opposite has happened, The Dawn newspaper reported on Friday.Existing privations have deepened; people’s mobility is restricted by security forces and there is unwarranted questioning of their activities. Many say they are made to feel like strangers in their own land, it said.Adding to the miseries of a large number of fishermen among the populace, the government, they complain, has issued licences to Chinese trawlers to fish in the waters off the coast. Their small boats cannot possibly compete, as a result of which their livelihoods are being squeezed. This is the petri dish of discontent from which have sprung the recent protests, it added.Balochistan is home to a long-running violent insurgency, and China’s presence in Gwadar has been the cause of much social unrest and led to anti-Chinese sentiment.It has also given a fillip to Baloch militant insurgent groups, who have carried out terrorist attacks in protest at CPEC projects.This year in August, a suicide bomber attacked a motorcade carrying Chinese personnel on the Gwadar East Bay Expressway project in which one Chinese was injured and two local children were killed.The Chinese embassy after the incident asked the Pakistan government to beef up security for the CPEC projects and the Chinese personnel working on them.In October last year, gunmen killed at least 14 people near Ormara on the coastal highway after ambushing a convoy of vehicles travelling from Gwadar to Karachi and in 2019 five people, including a Pakistani Navy soldier, were killed in an attack on the luxury Pearl Continental hotel in Gwadar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/protests-erupt-in-pakistan-s-gwadar-amid-growing-backlash-against-cpec-101637551638498.html

Some of the individuals were children and there are some fatalities as a result of this incident," Thompson told reporters.Asked about the fatalities, Thompson said: "I don't have an exact number at this time."It was not known whether the incident was related to terrorism, but an earlier shelter-in-place order in the town of around 72,000 had been lifted, he added.A video posted online showed a red SUV plowing through the parade, appearing to run over more than a dozen people before crowds ran from sidewalks to offer assistance. Moment the vehicle entered the crowd at the Christmas parade in Waukesha Wisconsin. pic.twitter.com/aOx2165XYmIn another video, police appeared to open fire on the vehicle as it crashed through street barriers.Thompson said an officer fired shots at the vehicle and no bystanders were injured.Belen Santamaria, her husband, and their three-year old daughter were planning to join the late afternoon parade with their Catholic Church. But Santamaria, a 39-year old Mexican factory worker, woke up on Sunday with a backache, so the family watched the procession from the sidewalk instead."The SUV came by at full speed," said Santamaria. "Then I started to hear people screaming."She hid in a restaurant with their daughter while her husband, 39-year old delivery worker Jesus Ochoa, ran ahead to try to help injured people. He said he heard through other members of their church that roughly 10 members, mostly Latinos and both adults and children, are injured."I was going to be there, walking," Santamaria said. "The SUV would have hit us too."DANCE GROUPS HITA woman told Milwaukee's Fox6 TV station that the SUV hit a dance team of girls between 9 and 15 years old. She said the immediate reaction was silence, followed by screaming, running and checking on those injured, Fox6 reported. Video on social media showed small groups surrounding injured girls with white pompoms scattered around.One witness said the driver also hit a group of "Dancing Grannies" and at least one person flipped over the hood of the SUV, according to Milwaukee's WISN-TV, an ABC affiliate."Members of the group and volunteers were impacted and we are waiting for word on their conditions," the Milwaukee Dancing Grannies said on their Facebook page. "Please keep the Grannies, all those injured, and all those who witnessed this horrible event in your thoughts and prayers."The local CBS affiliate later showed a picture on Twitter of what appeared to be the red SUV involved with its hood crumpled and front fender hanging off, parked in a driveway.Another witness estimated the SUV was going about 40 mph (64 kph) when it hit the crowd parading down the street, the TV station said."As we were walking back in between the buildings ... we saw an SUV cross over, just put the pedal to the metal and just zooming full speed along the parade route. And then we heard a loud bang, and just deafening cries and screams from people who are struck by the vehicle," Angelito Tenorio, an alderman in nearby West Allis, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.Photos and videos of Waukesha circulating on Twitter showed police cars and ambulances crowding a street decked out with Christmas lights in the aftermath of the incident, which occurred around 4:39 p.m. (2239 GMT). People bundled up against the cold huddled on sidewalks as dusk fell.Some of the injured were taken to the hospital by ambulance, others by police and still more by family and friends, Thompson said.The Children's Wisconsin hospital said on Twitter it had received 15 patients as of 8 p.m., with no reported fatalities at that time.Schools would remain closed on Monday for grades 4K-12 and additional counselors would be available for students who may need support services, the district superintendent of schools said.In 2015, four people were killed and 46 injured in Stillwater, Oklahoma when a woman drove into a crowd watching the homecoming parade for a football team.A truck was deliberately driven into a Christmas market in Berlin, Germany in 2016, killing 12 people in an attack linked to Islamic State.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-least-20-injured-after-suv-plows-into-wisconsin-christmas-parade-101637545103182.html

Ownership of a video player could lead to a public lashing.There was only one radio station, Voice of Sharia, that broadcast propaganda and Islamic programming.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-in-new-religious-guideline-asks-tv-channels-to-stop-airing-shows-with-women-actors-101637541964058.html

The crown prince denies any involvement."Do not sing for the murderers of my beloved Jamal," Cengiz wrote. "Please speak out and condemn his killer, Mohammed bin Salman. Your voice will be heard by millions."Bieber, who is Canadian, is among a group of artists scheduled to perform as Saudi Arabia hosts the Formula One Saudi Arabian Grand Prix in Jeddah."If you refuse to be a pawn of MBS, your message will be loud and clear: I do not perform for dictators. I choose justice and freedom over money," Cengiz wrote, using the crown prince's initials.Human rights groups have urged the performers to speak out against human rights issues in the kingdom."Saudi Arabia has a history of using celebrities and major international events to deflect scrutiny from its pervasive abuses," Human Rights Watch said on Wednesday.The advocacy group urged the performers, who also include rapper A$AP Rocky, DJs David Guetta and Tiesto and singer Jason Derulo, "to speak out publicly on rights issues or, when reputation-laundering is the primary purpose, not participate."Khashoggi, a Saudi-born U.S. resident who wrote opinion columns for the Washington Post critical of the Saudi crown prince, was killed and dismembered by a team of operatives linked to the prince in the kingdom's consulate in Istanbul. (Reporting by Kanishka Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Will Dunham)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dont-sing-for-murderers-jamal-khashoggi-s-fiancee-urges-justin-bieber-to-cancel-saudi-performance-101637541057147.html

22-11-2021||World||Ousted PM reinstated in Sudan||Sudan’s deposed prime minister signed a deal with the military on Sunday that will see him reinstated, almost a month after a military coup put him under house arrest. A key pro-democracy group that has mobilised dozens of protests had dismissed the deal as “a form of betrayal”.The country’s top general, Abdel Fattah Burhan, said in televised statements that Abdalla Hamdok will lead an independent technocratic Cabinet until elections can be held.It remains unclear how much power the government would hold. It would still remain under military oversight.It also remains unclear whether any political parties or pro-democracy groups have signed off on the agreement. The deal expects the military to release government officials and politicians arrested since the October 25 coup.Meanwhile, a 16-year-old boy was shot in the head and fatally wounded in the Sudanese capital on Sunday in a crackdown by security forces on anti-coup protests, medics said.The death raised to 41 the number of people killed since the October 25 coup, and it came hours after Hamdok was reinstated in a breakthrough deal to reverse the military takeover. “The signing of this deal opens the door wide enough to address all the challenges of the transitional period,” said Hamdok, speaking at the signing ceremony broadcast on state TV.The agreement comes just days after doctors said at least 15 people were killed by live fire during anti-coup demonstrations. Hamdok was held under house arrest by military leaders for weeks. The deal also stipulates that an investigation shall be conducted to identify those responsible for the killing and injuring of civilians and troops that marred protests following the coup.Hamdok thanked Sudan’s “regional and global friends” who helped in reaching this agreement but he did not name the countries.The 14-clause deal also stressed that power should be handed over to an elected civilian government after the end of the transitional period.“By signing this declaration, we could lay a genuine foundation to the transitional period,” said Burhan.The Sudanese Professionals’ Association, a group that played a key role in the uprising against Bashir, voiced their vehement opposition to the agreement, accusing Hamdok of committing “political suicide”.“This agreement only concerns its signatories and it is an unjust attempt to bestow legitimacy on the latest coup and the military council,” tweeted the group shortly after the deal was signed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ousted-pm-reinstated-in-sudan-101637531754658.html
22-11-2021||World||US lawmakers urge Katherine Tai to look for a deal during India visit||A bipartisan group of 75 US lawmakers have urged US Trade Representative (USTR) Katherine Tai to work towards a framework deal during her talks in New Delhi to quickly reinstate India’s benefits under an American preferential trade programme that allows tariff-free entry for imports from selective countries.But only if, they added, progress is made at the upcoming meeting of the Trade Policy Forum (TPF), the high platform for trade talks between the two sides, on the longstanding US demand for more access to Indian markets.The scheme - Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) - lapsed in December 2020; a replacement legislation to reform and modernise it is currently working its way through US Congress.But India’s benefits were suspended by the Trump administration much before in June 2019 after failing to get India grant US businesses to its markets.“If progress can be made at the TPF to address the market access issues that led to India’s termination as a GSP beneficiary, we strongly encourage you to create a framework for a deal that could be implemented soon after Congress reauthorises the GSP programme,” the lawmakers said in a joint letter to Katherine Tai.The letter was initiated by House of Representatives members Suzan DelBene, a Democrat, and Brad Westrup, a Republican. A total of more than 40 Democrats and 30 Republicans signed the letter.Tai meets her Indian counterpart union minister for commerce and industry Piyush Goyal on November 23.

No matter how “Taiwan independence” forces try to misrepresent facts and confound black and white, the historical fact that the mainland and Taiwan belong to one and the same China cannot be changed.”“Attempts to seek foreign support for political manipulation will prove a dead end,” the Chinese statement said.The downgrade is believed to be a deterrent to some other European countries, warning them not to try to provoke China on key issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-downgrades-diplomatic-ties-with-lithuania-over-taiwan-office-opening-101637502998533.html
22-11-2021||World||Upcoming India-US trade meet will set agenda for FTA: Nisha Biswal||Nisha Biswal, a former top US diplomat for India and head of the US-India Business Council, says that the upcoming meeting of the India-US Trade Policy Forum will set the framework for trade discussions on key areas of cooperation and alignment could create a path towards a Free Trade Agreement (FTA).Nisha Biswal also welcomed India’s willingness to negotiate an FTA. “Let me just welcome the much more positive and forward leaning stance that the Indian government has brought on the issue of free trade as someone who has been talking about the roadmap to an FTA for over a decade,” Biswal said in an interview. “There has never been in the past much of an appetite in India for an FTA certainly not with the United States, there was always a feeling that an FTA was going to disadvantage Indian companies and open up the Indian market too much to the US.”The trade policy forum, which is the top platform for India-US trade talks, will meet for the first time in four years this week when US trade representative (USTR) Katherine Tai is in New Delhi to meet commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal and other officials.Excerpts from the interview:So what’s going to happen now with Ambassador Tai in India next week?I believe that this will be the first trade policy forum in about four years. I think there was perhaps one at the very beginning of the Trump administration and then you know, we didn’t have one to do that. So, part of her focus from what I have been told in my conversations with USTR, really is to restart this process and to deepen kind of the institutional relationships and, you know, the frequency and the focus of these gatherings. And that’s a good thing.Where I would, perhaps challenge both governments and challenge trade representative Tai and minister Goyal is that process is important insofar as it advances goals and outcomes. And so, you’ve got also set some ambitious goals for where you want to go. What are the priority sectors? The Indian government has conveyed that it is open to the desirous of, you know, embarking on a (path) towards a Free Trade Agreement, which I think is a laudable goal and a worthy goal and unnecessary goal.You don’t appear too optimistic about deliverables and outcomes from this meeting.I don’t have an expectation. Do I think that both sides could have some important areas of an agreement that they could announce? I think that they could. I think a lot of work has been done over the years to try to come to some set of agreements around price controls on medical devices. A lot of work has been done on certain kinds of ICT (information and communications) tariffs. There are issues that the Indian government has raised that could be discussed, you know, I think, on GSP (Generalized System of Preferences), and, you know, I know that we don’t have an ability to reinstate GSP until Congress actually acts on it. Nonetheless, you know, there can be some conversations had there that would allow for certain understandings. So, I don’t preclude that there could be some things coming out of it. And we would welcome and encourage that. But what I’m saying is I don’t know that this is what either government wants to focus on. I think that what they want to do is get the framework right for how they’re going to take it forward.But why is a mini-deal not possible now? Can they not just pick up from where the Trump administration left off?I don’t think that there’s anything that precludes them from being able to get some kind of an outcome, right. A big chunk of the mini-deal hinged upon the restoration of GSP (President Donald Trump terminated India’s GSP benefits in 2019). GSP right now has lapsed as an entire programme has lapsed, right. So, it needs to be reauthorised by Congress. I think minus GSP it probably limits how much or what India is willing to put on the table in terms of what it gets back. So, the parameters of the mini-deal that existed are not currently in existence.But the more important thing will be for them to say, here are four areas that we know are priorities for our two governments to get right to harmonise and align our approaches and to create some opportunity. I think the digital economy is critically important. How are we going to address kind of the governance elements of a digital economy that is going to become more and more important for both countries. How are we dealing with emerging technology, whether it’s on 5G, whether it’s on AI, on semiconductors? How are we making sure that we are creating collaborative and aligned approaches to some of these areas that are going to shape the future economy for both of our countries and are going to be strategically important in the life sciences space. We have seen that US and India have been critically important to the world, you know, resolution of the Covid-19 pandemic, and India’s ability to create a vaccine supply chain is going to be really important to how the rest of the world survives and overcomes the pandemic. So, what do we need to address to facilitate that? Right. I think that there are a few areas that the two governments need to come together and say, “This is critically important, and we want to create a process for achieving greater harmonisation, alignment and convergence in these areas. And in so doing, it will create a much clearer path towards an FTA because we will have figured out what it takes for both sides to be able to achieve a more aligned approach that benefits both economies, both industries and workers in both countries.”You spoke about an FTA. That’s the new thing in the US trade relationship. And apparently, India’s very keen on it. You think it will come up at the meeting?Well, first of all, let me just welcome the much more positive and forward leaning stance that the Indian government has brought on the issue of free trade as someone who has been talking about the roadmap to an FTA for over a decade. There has never been in the past much of an appetite in India for an FTA certainly not with the United States, there was always a feeling that an FTA was going to disadvantage Indian companies and open up the Indian market too much to the US. Now, what I think India has understood is if it wants to be globally competitive, strategically and economically. It cannot exist as a silo. You cannot attract supply chains into India to manufacture for the world if you don’t have FTAs with most of the world, because you won’t be able to compete with producers in other countries that have huge FTAs. India does not have trade agreements with most of the major economies in the world. So, if you make in India, where are you exporting to?I just have one last question. And it is not trade related. It’s about s 400. What do you think is going to happen? You think the Biden’s administration could slap sanctions on India?I’m not privy to the thinking inside the administration. But I can tell you that we have been very clear and unequivocal that we think imposition of sanctions against one of our closest and most important partners would be counterproductive, would be not in our own national interest, and would get in the way of building and deepening the partnership between our two countries which is more important today than ever. So, we have said that we read that the deployment of the S-400 poses challenges and creates some concerns particularly around advanced US defence technology. And those concerns need to be addressed. But we also think that the US and India should be working behind doors to address those concerns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/upcoming-india-us-trade-meet-will-set-agenda-for-fta-nisha-biswal-101637478335587.html
22-11-2021||India||Toll tax to be levied soon on Delhi-Meerut Expressway: Report||Toll tax will be levied on people travelling on the Delhi-Meerut Expressway (DME) from next month onwards, Live Hindustan reported citing National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) officials familiar with the development.In September, NHAI rolled out tentative toll rates for the Delhi-Meerut Expressway (DME) between Sarai Kale Khan in Delhi and Meerut in Uttar Pradesh and also opened bids for prospective toll collectors, according to a news report by HT.There is no toll currently levied while travelling on DME. The NHAI set a tentative rate of ₹140 as the toll fee for travelling the full 60km length of DME.Commuters will be charged on the basis of distance travelled and the toll will be deducted from the FASTag system linked to the vehicle. In case the vehicle does not have a FASTag, the vehicle owner will be charged doubly for failing to have FASTag at the exit point and also penalise the driver.The DME which is 59.77km has three phases—Phase 1 links Sarai Kale Khan and UP Gate, Phase 2 connects UP Gate and Dasna and Phase 4 connects Dasna and Meerut. The six-lane 32-km access-controlled alignment between Dasna and Hapur is Phase 3 but it does not come under the DME.According to the Live Hindustan report, NHAI requested the Union ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) to charge a toll on all three phases but the ministry wanted the road in Phase 4 to be repaired first. It also highlighted that work in Chipiyana in Phase 2 is incomplete.The highways ministry also asked NHAI to construct the Railway Over Bridge (ROB) in Chipiyana and said that a call will be taken on toll tax imposition after that.Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to inaugurate the DME and dedicate it to the people of the nation in December, people familiar with the developments said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/toll-tax-to-be-levied-soon-on-delhi-meerut-expressway-report-101637603482752.html

The Commission said a separate one-day review meeting with officials of all the poll going states is also scheduled on Tuesday to discuss various matters related to election management.According to the press release from the ECI, the conference was organized to discuss and review various thematic issues related to electoral roll, polling stations, ongoing special summary revision, IT applications, timely resolution of grievances, EVMs/VVPATs, training and capacity building of polling staff, media and communication and extensive voter outreach program amongst others.During his address, Chief Election Commissioner Sushil Chandra stressed the significance of effectiveness and visibility of CEOs and asked them to ensure the purity of the electoral roll, availability of Assured Minimum Facilities and ensure better facilities at all polling booths for all voters.He asked the CEOs for expeditious redressal of all pending applications especially with regard to voter registration and added that the CEOs should have regular interaction with political parties to redress their grievances too.“CEC Shri Sushil Chandra during his address added that the objective of this conference is to identify the gaps and challenges to ensure instructions of the Commission are implemented uniformly in all States /UTs across the country,” the press release said.Election Commissioner (EC) Rajiv Kumar while interacting with the CEOs pointed out that even though the legal and regulatory framework of the elections is quite robust, the implementation of various instructions of the Commission at the field is very critical.He stressed that CEOs need to be innovative, more active and should learn from each other’s best practices and challenges.Adding on to Kumar’s emphasis on working on the implementation at the field level, EC Anup Chandra Pandey pointed towards the need to focus on the training and capacity building of Booth Level Officers (BLOs).

22-11-2021||India||Rulers need to introspect daily, people ‘ultimate lords’ of democracy: CJI Ramana||Rulers should introspect everyday whether the decisions taken by them are good and also check if they have any bad characteristics, Chief Justice of India NV Ramana said on Monday. Addressing the 40th convocation of Sri Sathya Sai Institute of Higher Learning in Puttaparthi town in Anantapuramu district, Justice Ramana, quoting Mahabharata and Ramayana, said there are 14 bad qualities of rulers which they should avoid. “All the rulers in the democratic set-up, before beginning their routine work, should introspect whether they have any bad characteristics. There is need to offer just administration and it should be according to people's needs. There are several wise men here and you are watching the developments that are taking place worldwide and countrywide,” he said. He said people are the ultimate lords in democracy and whatever decision has been taken by the dispensation should benefit them. He further said it was his desire that all the systems in the country should be independent and honest aiming to serve the people which Sathya Sai Baba also used to say the same thing. Unfortunately, the modern education system tends to focus only on the utilitarian function and such a system is not equipped to deal with the moral or spiritual function of education which builds the character of students and allows them to develop a social consciousness and a sense of responsibility, Justice Ramana said. “True education is one which imbibes moral values and virtues of humility, discipline, selflessness, compassion, tolerance, forgiveness and mutual respect,” He said. On Sathya Sai Baba, Justice Ramana said, "I had the good fortune of having Baba's darshan. I have always carried with me his words of wisdom." He further said: "There is no greater proponent of service, no greater mentor to follow than Baba himself. Sathya Sai means love, Sathya Sai means service, Sathya Sai means sacrifice.” “…Be it education, medical care, providing clean drinking water, relief work, Baba has showed us the righteous path. This is the concept embedded in our cultural ethos of 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam' (the world is one family),” he said adding Baba's life should be an inspiration to one and all. The world has gone through unprecedented changes during the past two years and the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed and highlighted deep-rooted vulnerabilities and has increased the inequalities in society, the CJI said. “In such times, selfless service is the need of the hour. I feel so encouraged by the fact that this idea of service is still strong in the hearts and minds of the people, including students of this institution, to provide relief to those in need,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rulers-need-to-introspect-daily-people-ultimate-lords-of-democracy-cji-ramana-101637596144543.html

22-11-2021||India||India quietly marks 50 years of key battle before 1971 war began||India on Monday quietly marked the 50th anniversary of a key battle in erstwhile East Pakistan, 11 days before India and Pakistan officially went to war in 1971, in which the Indian Army completely wiped out a Pakistani tank squadron, the Indian Air Force shot down three enemy fighter jets and an estimated 300 Pakistani soldiers were killed or injured, according to military historians who have studied the battle in detail. The Battle of Garibpur, which included a fierce confrontation between rival tanks on November 21, 1971, and an air battle a day later, ended with the Indian Army creating an important launchpad for the upcoming offensive into enemy territory and set the stage for the creation of military history 24 days later with the liberation of Bangladesh.“In the run-up to the 1971 war, the Indian armed forces were focussed on creating launchpads across the border fully aware that a full-scale military confrontation was imminent. Garibpur was among the key launch pads because of its proximity to Jessore in erstwhile East Pakistan,” said Brigadier Balram Singh Mehta (retd), an armoured corps officer who fought in the Battle of Garibpur as a young captain.The C Squadron of the Indian Army’s 45 Cavalry destroyed 14 American M-24 Chaffee tanks of the Pakistan Army on November 21 at Garibpur at the expense of two Indian PT-76 tanks, with the IAF’s Gnats intercepting a detachment of Pakistan Air Force fighter jets and shooting down three F-86 Sabres in the first aerial combat with PAF in the build-up to 1971 war. The IAF calls the air action Battle of Boyra.On November 22, 1971, four PAF F-86 Sabres violated Indian airspace and attempted to strafe Indian positions when they were intercepted by an equal number of IAF Gnats of the No. 22 Squadron (Swifts). All the IAF fighter jets returned to base unscathed. Flight Lieutenant Roy Andrew Massey, who led the four-aircraft package, was awarded India’s third highest wartime gallantry award, Vir Chakra, along with Flying Officer Donald Lazarus and Flight Lieutenant MA Ganapathy.The Battle of Garibpur, followed by the Battle of Boyra, was for all practical purposes the beginning of the 1971 war, said Air Vice Marshal Arjun Subramaniam (retd), a military historian and the author of India’s Wars: A Military History 1947-1971. “It was part of the Indian Army’s shallow thrusts into erstwhile East Pakistan to create bases for subsequent operations. The Battle of Garibpur and its outcome was significant as the army was shaping the future battlefield,” said Subramaniam. The Indira Gandhi government cleared the army to cross the international border “for self-defence” in a decision taken on November 18, experts said. “In one fell swoop, the 3 (Independent) Armoured Squadron, consisting of Chaffee tanks, was completely destroyed and two infantry battalions badly mauled… The biggest attack planned by Lieutenant General AAK Niazi (Pakistani commander) to teach the Indians and the Mukti Bahini a lesson had gone up in smoke. This battle was a victory and a decisive one at that. Garibpur was held in a bold and decisive move by ground troops, one battalion beat back an enemy brigade,” Mehta wrote in his 2016 book The Burning Chaffees: A Soldier’s First-Hand Account of the 1971 War.The 13-day war ended on December 16 with the creation of a new country, Bangladesh, and the Indian Army taking 93,000 Pakistanis as prisoners of war.Also, it was on November 21 that the Bangladesh government-in-exile under Sheikh Mujibur Rahman placed its armed forces and freedom fighters directly under the Indian Army’s Eastern Command. Bangladesh celebrates November 21 as Armed Forces Day. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, who visited the Bangladesh High Commission in Delhi on Monday to attend a reception to mark the Armed Forces Day, said, “This year is of extraordinary significance for India-Bangladesh relations as we commemorate the golden jubilee of the Liberation of Bangladesh and the birth centenary of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. In this momentous time, I salute the valiant struggle of the Mukti Bahini in the Muktijuddho, the War of Liberation in 1971”. Singh described the war for the liberation of Bangladesh as an unprecedented event in the 20th century history. “It was a moral fight against injustice, atrocities and oppression. Ordinary people were brutally maimed and murdered. The barbaric atrocities of Operation Searchlight (a crackdown by the Pak army to crush the voices of self-determination) stirred the conscience of the world.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-quietly-marks-50-years-of-key-battle-before-1971-war-began-101637592230340.html
22-11-2021||India||Southern states to receive more rain as govts assess damages||Several southern states continued to bear the brunt of heavy rainfall even as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) predicted light to moderate rain in Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry in the next five days.“Light to moderate scattered/fairly widespread rainfall over Karnataka, Kerala and Mahe and Tamilnadu, Puducherry and Karaikal during next 5 days. Isolated heavy rainfall over Tamilnadu, Puducherry and Karaikal and Kerala and Mahe during next 5 days and over coastal Karnataka on November 21,” the IMD said in a tweet.Citizens in Andhra Pradesh continue to face troubles due to the heavy rain, which caused floods and led to the damage of roads as well as personal and public property.According to news agency PTI, the state recorded at least 30 deaths and several thousand people have been displaced due to the floods in the Penna and Cheyyeru rivers. After 200,000 cusecs of water flowed out of the Somasila reservoir in SPS Nellore, the Cheyyeru river went into spate leading to severe inundation of Togurupeta, Mandapalli, Pulapathur and Gundlur villages and many other hamlets.The Andhra Pradesh government also announced that it will distribute essential commodities like rice, dal, edible oil, onions, and potatoes to all flood-affected families free of cost. The state government also held a review meeting on the flood situation in the Chittoor, Nellore, Kadapa and Anantapur districts.Heavy rains lash BengaluruParts of Bengaluru remained inundated on Monday following heavy rains on Sunday night. Yelahanka and Mahadevapura areas of the city witnessed water entering houses of residents.Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta said that the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) was present at the spot and will hand out essentials to affected residents. Visuals shared by news agencies showed roads in the Kendriya Vihar area of Bengaluru completely submerged and police officials helping residents in various areas of the city.Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai said that a decision was taken on Monday to release ₹500 crore to repair roads and bridges damaged due to incessant rains and floods in different parts of the state. Bommai said that officials were instructed to immediately disburse compensation for those whose houses have been damaged.He also said that surveys of crop loss due to rains are also being conducted and after receiving the final report compensation will be released.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/southern-states-to-receive-more-rain-as-govts-assess-damages-101637591313454.html
22-11-2021||India||First national survey of domestic workers launched||Union labour minister Bhupender Yadav on Monday rolled out the country’s first survey of domestic workers, the latest among a group of five national jobs enumeration campaigns aimed at discerning data on the country’s vast informal workforce that will feed a forthcoming national employment policy in Asia’s third-largest economy. Domestic workers are believed to be a million strong, but there is little official information on their actual numbers and parameters, such as work conditions and average pay. Lack of such data leaves them out of any formal policy governing the country’s informal workers, who make up a majority of the total workforce.The survey is designed to fill this gap and offer “time-series data on domestic workers”, the minister said. The survey for domestic workers is among five national jobs surveys that will be conducted periodically and provide crucial data for an upcoming national employment policy being planned by the Modi government, an official said, requesting anonymity. In September, the government had released the results of the first All-India Quarterly Establishment-based Employment Survey (AQEES) for the April-June 2021 quarter.Along with the latest survey, the AQEES is part of four other annual surveys conducted by the labour bureau. These are the All-India Survey of Migrant Workers, All-India Survey of Domestic Workers, All-India Survey of Employment Generated by Professionals and All-India Survey of Employment Generated in the Transport Sector. The survey, for the first time, will provide a headcount of domestic workers and their employers through a nationwide household-based survey. According to the manual of the survey, specific features of domestic work such as living conditions, their employment relationships, would be looked at extensively which are usually not covered in the traditional labour force surveys. “The numbers, thus, thrown up would improve the availability of official data on DW and would provide a basis for meaningful social dialogue,” the manual states. The parameters the survey aims to capture include the number and proportion of household workers by major states, with separate rural and urban break-ups, their percentage distribution, households that employ them and socio-demographic characteristics.The labour bureau’s all India quarterly establishment-based employment survey (AQEES) in September showed a 29% increase in employment in nine sectors during the peak Covid-19 months of April-June 2021 over a base of 2013-14. The survey showed a jump in jobs in sectors such as IT, business process outsourcing and manufacturing. India lacks official short-term, high-frequency jobs data and the AQEES is meant to fill the critical gap. Economists usually depend on the Periodic Labour Force Survey, a government jobs survey, or data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), a private data firm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/first-national-survey-of-domestic-workers-launched-101637591089800.html
22-11-2021||India||Advisory group on immunization likely to discuss booster dose in upcoming meeting||The top government expert panel on immunisation is likely to take up key issues regarding administering booster Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccine doses, and opening vaccination for children, in its next meeting scheduled towards the end of this month, said people familiar with the matter.The Covid-19 working group of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (NTAGI) is likely to meet in the last week of November.“The experts on the panel have been discussing these issues in past meetings but the decision is ultimately taken based on the quality of evidence, including real-world data, and consensus among the members within the group,” said a senior person in the know of things, on condition of anonymity.As for offering booster doses as evidence currently suggests that vaccine-derived immunity is not for life, the government experts are also likely to announce a detailed policy on administering additional doses soon. However, the government priority remains to vaccinate all adults first.Even the Union health minister mentioned on past several occasions that the decision to vaccinate children will not be taken in a hurry, and before booster doses, the government’s focus was to ensure all adults were vaccinated against Covid-19.“The experts have to be fully convinced on the issue as it is a matter of children. We will have to be extremely careful as even the developed countries that have begun vaccinating their children are treading cautiously. The decision of the experts will be final on this,” said Mansukh Mandaviya, Union health minister, during one of the recent media interactions.“Vaccinating all adults is on government’s priority list; booster doses come later,” he added.Only one Covid-19 vaccine, Zydus Healthcare’s ZyCoV-D, that was tested in children aged 12 years and above has been approved for emergency use in India. The drugs controller general of India is still reviewing the emergency use authorization of Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin that has been tested in children aged 2 years and above, even though the expert committee recommended it for use in children. According to people familiar with the development, even if a consensus is reached on starting vaccination in children among panel members, it is highly likely that the exercise will be conducted in a phased manner wherein the first phase will include children with comorbidities.Government experts are at present working on a list of comorbidities that could determine which children are eligible for a vaccine first. The list is likely to have those on cancer treatment; transplant cases; those with compromised immunity, etc. Experts, however, have been saying that there may not be an immediate need but eventually all children will have to be vaccinated.“Eventually, we will have to vaccinate all children and not just those at risk because children can bring the infection home and expose those members who are at high risk, especially the elderly and sick in the family,” said Dr JS Bhasin, director and head, department of paediatrics, BLK Hospital.A Booster dose is also likely to be introduced in a phased manner, with those at high risk getting the additional vaccine shot first. “The experts will focus on India’s requirements and local data to draft the plan. Global data is important but India also has managed to generate a significant amount of data that will be relevant in decision making,” said the person cited above.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/advisory-group-on-immunization-likely-to-discuss-booster-dose-in-upcoming-meeting-101637589589855.html
22-11-2021||India||Tripura court grants bail to Trinamool Congress youth leader Saayoni Ghosh||A local court in Tripura on Monday granted bail to Trinamool Congress youth wing leader and actor Saayoni Ghosh, arrested a day earlier for allegedly “disturbing” the chief minister Biplab Deb's public meeting.Police in Tripura also slapped charges on Ghosh for allegedly promoting enmity between people, attempt-to-murder, criminal intimidation and criminal conspiracy, apart from disrupting a civic poll rally led by Biplab Deb on Saturday.According to multiple reports citing police, Ghosh chanted Trinamool Congress' iconic slogan ‘khela hobe’ at the street-side meeting addressed by the chief minister. Soon after, the Bharatiya Janata Party filed an FIR against her at the East Agartala Women’s police station.However, Trinamool Congress general secretary Kunal Ghosh claimed that someone attending Biplab Deb's rally spotted Saayoni Ghosh in a vehicle and greeted her with “Didi, khela hobe” and the youth leader replied with “haan, khela hobe.”Ghosh's arrest came a day before Trinamool Congress national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee's scheduled roadshow in Agartala. Trinamool Congress Rajya Sabha MP Sushmita Dev claimed the motive behind Ghosh's arrest in the alleged ‘attempt-to-murder case’ was to disrupt Abhishek Banerjee’s rally. It is not immediately known if the Trinamool Congress leader's roadshow continued as planned even though he was reportedly in Tripura's state capital till the filing of this report.ALSO READ | Tripura civic polls: TMC MPs meet Shah to protest against attacks on its workersThe political battlefield in Tripura is heating up ahead of the November 25 civic polls.

We require 41 lakh tonnes of grains for buffer stock, but procured 110 lakh tonnes. If MSP law is made, all farmers will demand MSP on their crops and no one will be in a position to earn anything out of that,” Ghanwat was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.The panel member, who had earlier rued over the Narendra Modi government’s decision to repeal the three central farm laws, said he hoped another committee would be formed comprising leaders from the opposition and farming communities.He said the current government had the will to reform agriculture unlike previous regimes.We're not against MSP but open-ended procurement is a problem.

If MSP law is made,all farmers will demand MSP on their crops &no one will be in a position to earn anything out of that: Anil Ghanwat pic.twitter.com/wOVxcPe80w“It is very unfortunate that the farm laws were taken back. Farmers were demanding reforms for the last 40 years. This is not a good step. The existing system of agriculture is not enough,” he further said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-against-msp-but-open-ended-procurement-a-problem-anil-ghanwat-101637581848324.html

He said he spoke to Tripura chief minister over the phone yesterday and will seek a report from the state,” TMC leader Kalyan Banerjee was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Derek O'Brien, Sukhendu Sekhar Roy, Santanu Sen, Kalyan Banerjee and Mala Roy along with 11 other MPs were part of the delegation which met home minister Amit Shah.The Trinamool MPs said on Sunday that they would protest against the alleged disruptions caused by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers during campaigning in Tripura. Numerous clashes between both sets of cadres have been reported over the past month ahead of the civic body polls in the state.Trinamool chief Mamata Banerjee on Monday also called for support for her party’s workers in Tripura and said she will discuss the issue with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during her meeting with him this week. The West Bengal chief minister attacked her Tripura counterpart Biplab Deb and accused him of creating an atmosphere of lawlessness in the state.“The administration, the BJP and the chief minister himself are defying the Supreme Court verdict. The Tripura issue will be raised in Delhi, Mumbai and everywhere else. I'll meet the PM regarding this issue. They want to capture power and bulldoze the federal structure in the name of cooperative federalism,” Mamata Banerjee was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.She was referring to the Supreme Court order issued earlier this month which instructed the Tripura police to ensure that no political party is prevented from exercising their rights in accordance with the law for campaigning in a peaceful manner.Tensions remain high as another TMC lawmaker and Mamata Banerjee’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee is currently in Agartala despite permission being denied for his roadshow.Over the past week, several clashes have been reported and the Tripura police also detained TMC youth wing leader Saayoni Ghosh for allegedly disturbing a public meeting, which was attended by Tripura chief minister Biplab Deb.Former Union minister and ex-BJP leader Babul Supriyo also alleged that on Saturday he was harassed by BJP cadres as he was assessing poll preparations. The BJP workers denied these allegations.Tripura civic body polls are scheduled to be held on November 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tripura-civic-polls-tmc-mps-meet-shah-to-protest-against-attacks-on-its-workers-101637579881809.html
22-11-2021||India||Two former Uttarakhand chief ministers meet, spark speculation||Ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Trivendra Singh Rawat on Sunday met Harish Rawat of the opposition Congress and fuelled speculation ahead of the assembly elections due early next year. The meeting came months after the BJP leader was removed as the Uttarakhand chief minister in March.The two posted photographs of their meeting on Facebook and said they met to ask about each other’s well-being. “It was nice to see Trivendra Singh Rawat in an enthusiastic mood,” wrote the Congress leader. Trivendra Singh Rawat wrote the two met after a long interval. “There has been an improvement in his health after recovering from Covid-19. When asked about his health, he replied in his style-- ‘I am healthy’.”Political analyst S M A Kazmi said the BJP leader has been unhappy with his party since he was asked to step down as the chief minister. “He is also being given somewhat less importance by the party leadership. Meeting Harish Rawat and then posting its photographs on Facebook was an attempt to show his clout...”Also Read | Free pilgrimage for Uttarakhand senior citizens if AAP comes to power: KejriwalM M Semwal, a political science professor at Garhwal Central University, ruled out the possibility of Trivendra Singh Rawat joining Congress and called the meeting a pressure tactic. “It is visible that he is not being given enough importance in the party. Hence, by meeting Harish Rawat and then sharing photographs on his Facebook, he is in a way trying to send a message that he is not weak if they assume him to be so and has options...”The BJP leader could not be contacted for comments but Harish Rawat tried to play down the speculation. “It was a very informal meeting. I was visiting a physiotherapy centre in Dehradun on Sunday evening where Trivendra came to meet me as he lives in the nearby area. We had a healthy informal conversation in which we asked about each other’s health and well-being. Despite being from rival parties, we should not lose mutual respect.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-former-uttarakhand-chief-ministers-meet-spark-speculation-101637580166114.html
22-11-2021||India||Cold wave conditions likely in Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan over next two days||Cold wave conditions are likely in parts of Punjab, Haryana and northern Rajasthan for the first time this season over the next two days, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Monday.A minimum temperature of 10 degrees Celsius or below and/or 4.5 notches lesser than the season’s normal for two consecutive days is classified as a cold wave in the plains. A cold wave is also declared when the minimum temperature is less than four degrees Celsius in the plains. The mercury in Delhi fell to 9.6 or three degrees below the normal on November 17 and 9.8 degrees Celsius, three notches below normal, on Sunday. On Monday, the minimum temperature was 11.4 degrees Celsius. Hisar recorded 7.2 degrees Celsius, four notches below normal on Monday.D S Pai, who heads climate research and services at IMD (Pune) said there are two ways by which the temperature falls. “One is a clear sky, which leads to the warmth radiating back quickly from the surface. It is called radiational cooling. There are clear skies over northwest India now.” He added the other reason for cold setting in is that northwesterly cold and dry winds are blowing over the region from the Himalayas. “There is a low-pressure area over the Arabian Sea, which causes advection of northwesterly winds over the northwestern region. Consecutive low-pressure areas have formed over the Arabian Sea.”A cyclonic circulation is lying over the southeast Bay of Bengal and neighbourhood in lower tropospheric levels. It is very likely to move west-northwestward towards the Tamil Nadu coast during the next four-five days. A trough (line of low pressure) is running from the cyclonic circulation over the southeast Bay of Bengal and neighbourhood to the Tamil Nadu coast. In association with the cyclonic circulation, moderate to heavy rainfall is likely in Karnataka, Kerala, Mahe, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, and Karaikal during the next five days.Also Read: Winter woes: Keep seasonal allergies at bayR K Jenamani, a senior scientist at IMD’s National Weather Forecasting Centre, said they were expecting cold air incursion. “In Delhi, there may not be cold wave conditions but minimum temperatures will fall to about 8 to 9 degrees, around three to four notches below normal. In rural pockets, the cold wave conditions are likely to set in.”Weak La Niña conditions, which are also associated with colder winters in northwest India, are prevailing over the equatorial Pacific region. The latest model forecast is indicating they are likely to strengthen and peak to moderate conditions during the winter season. Thereafter, the La Niña conditions are likely to start weakening to reach cold El Niño and the Southern Oscillation (ENSO) neutral conditions during the second quarter of the next year, according to an IMD bulletin for November.ENSO is a periodic fluctuation in sea surface temperature and the air pressure of the overlying atmosphere across the equatorial Pacific Ocean. It has a major influence on weather and climate patterns such as heavy rains, floods, and drought. El Niño has a warming influence on global temperatures. La Niña has the opposite effect. In India, El Nino is associated with drought or weak monsoon while La Nina with the strong monsoon, above-average rains, and colder winters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cold-wave-conditions-likely-in-punjab-haryana-rajasthan-over-next-two-days-101637579206059.html
22-11-2021||India||Protect small fishermen, oppose ban on fishing subsidies: BMS tells government||The Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS), an affiliate of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), wants the Centre to oppose a group of countries that has urged the World Trade Organization (WTO) to push for withdrawal of fishing subsidies, arguing that such a move will be detrimental to the interests of small fishermen. The organisation representing labour unions has alleged that by allowing big trawlers and ships to resort to deep-sea fishing, the government has worsened the difficulties faced by small fishermen. Last month, 296 scientists from 46 countries urged the WTO to pass a motion to ban fishery subsidies. In a submission to the WTO, the scientists said the ban must be considered to “curb overfishing, biodiversity degradation and loss, and carbon dioxide emissions, and to safeguard food and livelihoods”. “WTO members must prohibit fisheries subsidies that cause harm such as those that lower the cost of fuel and vehicle construction and those that provide price support to keep market prices artificially high,” the scientists wrote. Watch: Modi govt reacts to Pakistan navy killing Indian fisherman off Gujarat coastThe BMS has, however, argued that if the Indian government agrees to the demand from developed countries in banning fishing subsidies, such a move will hamper the livelihood of millions of marine fishermen in 10 coastal states. “There is pressure building on the Indian government to also push for ending subsidies. So, we are urging the government to refrain from siding with the demand as the majority [of fishermen] in India are small fishermen who do not have the wherewithal for deep-sea fishing,” said Binay Kumar Sinha, BMS general secretary. He said the organisation strongly opposes the proposals on banning subsidies to fishermen in the “name of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing” by the organised sector’s fishermen. Pointing out the differences in fishing practices followed in India as against those in developed countries, Sinha said small fishermen in India and developing countries face many limitations and low capacities, and are not responsible for depleting marine reserves. “It is the organised sector’s fishing that catches fish through mechanised trawlers and huge ships, particularly by developed countries that are responsible for depleting marine fishing reserves. In India, traditional fishermen follow norms, such as observing a fishing ban during breeding season. Apart from this, small fishermen are allowed to catch fish within only 12 nautical miles. It is in no way hampering the reserves,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/protect-small-fishermen-oppose-ban-on-fishing-subsidies-bms-tells-government-101637578547716.html

22-11-2021||India||BJP focussing on youth and professionals: Rituraj Sinha||Rituraj Sinha’s elevation to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national president JP Nadda’s core team is an indication of a generational shift in the BJP which began soon after the 2019 Lok Sabha election with the aim to infuse youth and professionals into the organisational set up, people aware of the development said.Son of veteran BJP leader RK Sinha, the founder of Security and Intelligence Services (SIS), Rituraj Sinha has been actively working since 2005 for the BJP’s growth in a state it has struggled to dominate. He was key to BJP’s war room management and the party’s campaign committee during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections in Bihar. In 2019, he was roped in for the national campaign committee headed by Arun Jaitley. The latest recognition came on Sunday when he was appointed national secretary of the party.“It is an honour to be in the BJP president’s national team and I will discharge whatever responsibility is given to me. It is true that the BJP is looking for a generational shift with focus on youth and professionals from varied fields. From Bihar, I am only the second person to be included in the national team as secretary, while former Union minister Radha Mohan Singh is the vice president,” said Rituraj, who went to Doon School before getting an MBA degree from Leeds University and completing Public Leadership Credential programme from the Harvard University.Rituraj said he has seen the party evolve in the 15+ years of his association. “Even otherwise, one can witness the party’s shift towards professionals and youth, which was also evident in the Union cabinet shakeup. In Bihar too, I was the co-convenor of the team that gave shape to the party’s manifesto for the 2020 assembly election on the theme of ‘self-reliant’ Bihar. In fact, Bihar was the first state to align its manifesto with the national agenda of self-reliant India. I had the privilege of working closely with Bihar BJP incharge Bhupendra Yadav. I also worked at the mandal level in three districts of Barh, Nalanda and Nawada,” he added.Also Read: Bihar ministers involved in liquor trade, alleges Tejashwi YadavRituraj said the BJP aims to effectively communicate the good work done by the Central government to the masses. “A lot is happening and a lot more will happen as the country under Prime Minister Narendra Modi is breaking the stereotypes to develop a new India. It is in this backdrop that the party is focusing on youth and professionals at all levels, as they will lead the country in future,” he said.After the 2020 assembly elections, many fresh faces from the Bihar BJP were given responsibilities in chief minister Nitish Kumar-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government in the state, underlining the party’s thinking. Rituraj’s elevation is also being seen as an extension of the party’s youth oriented approach to leadership development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-focussing-on-youth-and-professionals-ruturaj-sinha-101637577166738.html

Rather he must assure the policy of MSP. They claim they have formed a committee on MSP, but this is a lie. A report of a committee in 2011 recommended that the MSP must be guaranteed. We don't want another committee. We want you to implement the recommendation of the previous committee," Tikait said.He further said the government has lied about implementing the recommendations of the Swaminathan committee. "The government is not giving employment. It is adamant to turn the country into a private mandi," he added.He said the farmers’ struggle will continue. "The government should either talk to us or our struggle will continue. If you won’t listen to us, the movement will continue against you," he added.He further said the arrest of Union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra Teni is one of the protesting farmers’ main demands. Teni’s son is in jail for his involvement in last month’s Lakhimpur Kheri violence in which at least four farmers were killed. “If Teni inaugurates a sugar mill, then the sugarcane of that mill will be sent to the DM's office.""If militants of Kashmir can come to Agra Jail, then the killer of farmers will also be sent to the same jail," he added.Tikait further said, "We don't want to make the Prime Minister of the country weak, but we want him to listen to us. If the PM does not listen to us, then the protest will continue against him.""The government must also withdraw cases against the protesting farmers," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/took-us-a-year-to-make-some-understand-farm-laws-are-harmful-rakesh-tikait-101637576836997.html

How it happened||President Ram Nath Kovind on Monday awarded the Vir Chakra to Group Captain Abhinandan Varthaman who, in 2019, shot down a Pakistani F-16 fighter jet during a dogfight over the Line of Control (LOC) in the aftermath of the Balakot airstrike. Abhinandan received the third-highest wartime gallantry award at the Rashtrapati Bhavan in New Delhi for showing “conspicuous courage” and demonstrating “gallantry in the face of the enemy while disregarding personal safety” with an “exceptional sense of duty”.What happened on February 27, 2019?A day before, India had conducted an airstrike on Jaish-e-Mohammed’s (JeM) camp in Pakistan’s Balakot after crossing the Line of Control (LoC) in a major “non-military pre-emptive action”. On February 27, a large force of Pakistan Air Force fighter aircraft consisting of advanced fourth-generation F-16 and JF-17 was detected heading towards the LoC at around 9.55am. Within minutes, Abhinandan, then a Wing Commander, scrambled to intercept the jets and scanned the low altitude airspace with the airborne intercept (AI) radar of his MiG-21 Bison.“Displaying exceptional air combat acumen and knowledge of the enemy’s tactics, Abhinandan scanned the low altitude airspace with his airborne intercept (AI) radar and picked up an enemy aircraft that was flying low to ambush the Indian fighter interceptor aircraft," Abhinandan’s citation reads.Abhinandan Varthaman: Know the IAF officer, now a Vir Chakra awardeeHe alerted the other formation pilots about this surprise threat and gathered his wingman in an offensive formation against the hostile Pakistani jet which, according to the citation, had started dropping weapons on Indian Army positions. The “audacious and aggressive manoeuvre” by Wing Commander Abinandan “forced the enemy aircraft into tactical chaos”. The enemy aircraft, including the ones that were yet to launch their air to ground weapons, were forced to turn back.Abhinandan pursued the retreating F-16 fighter jet and shot it down with his onboard missile.“However, in the melee, one of the enemy aircraft fired multiple advanced BVR missiles, one of which hit his aircraft forcing him to eject in enemy territory,” the citation further states.He was captured by the enemy in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) and was repatriated on March 1, 2019. Despite being captured by Pakistan, the citation says, Abhinandan continued to display exceptional resolve in dealing with the adversary in a stoic, brave and dignified manner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/when-abhinandan-varthaman-shot-down-pakistan-s-f-16-fighter-jet-how-it-happened-101637573096733.html

The house had 116 minor inmates accused of various crimes and this was not the first such incident at the observation home. Earlier in May 2020, 27 minor boys had escaped from the facility after attacking the staff with knives and firewood.Observation homes are for temporary stay of juveniles in conflict with the law during the pendency of any inquiry against him or her. Children in conflict with law brought under the purview of the Indian Penal Code and other legislations are produced before the Juvenile Justice Board, constituted as per Section 4 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000 and Amendment Act 2006. The apprehended children are normally detained under probation up to 4 months in these facilities.Also Read: Odisha court seeks call details of law minister’s aides in double murder caseIn Odisha, 16 observation homes including the one in Berhampur are functioning. However, a study by the Centre for Child Rights of National Law School of India, Cuttack in 2015 found several problems with the observation homes in the state. For instance, the dormitories in the Berhampur home housed 58 children in the age group of 10-18 against the maximum capacity of 40. The survey also found that the homes did not maintain mandatory protocols like installation of children suggestion box, display of child protection protocol, weekly food menu chart, formation of children committee, risk management plan etc.Not just that, it was found that there was no provision for professional counselling and guidance for social mainstreaming of children and no attention was given to individual care plan to address their developmental needs.

22-11-2021||India||Domestic workers survey flagged off, instruction manual unveiled||Union Labour Minister Bhupender Yadav on Monday flagged off the fieldwork of All India Survey on Domestic Workers and unveiled its instruction manual.It will cover 742 districts of 37 states in the country."This survey will cover a database of five and a half lakh households across the country and cover all types of domestic services like cook, driver, housekeeping, tutors (for children), watchman etc. This evidence-based study will help the government in policy-making for this segment of workers," Yadav said, addressing at the launch of fieldwork of the survey.Rapid urbanisation due to expansion would lead to migration of workers and a rise in the number of domestic workers, he added.Yadav released an instruction manual with a questionnaire for the All India Survey on Domestic Workers being conducted by Labour Bureau, Chandigarh.According to the latest data on the e-Shram portal, around 8.8 per cent of the registered 8.56 crore informal sector workers fall in the category of domestic workers.Labour Secretary Sunil Barthwal said that if we take into account that we would cover 38 crore informal sector workers on the e-Shram portal then there are three to three-and-half crore domestic workers in the country.He also said that domestic workers are the third-largest category of workers after agriculture and construction.Domestic workers (DWs) constitute a significant portion of total employment in the informal sector. However, there is a dearth of data on the magnitude and prevailing employment conditions of DW, a labour ministry statement said.Hence with the view to have time-series data on domestic workers, the central government has entrusted Labour Bureau to conduct an all- India survey on DWs. It will help the government understand the significant issues on the certain special and vulnerable segments of labour and will guide effective policymaking, it added.All India Survey on Domestic Workers is aimed to estimate the number and proportion of domestic workers at the national and state level, percentage distribution of domestic workers for live-in/live-out, formal/ informal employment, migrant/non-migrant, their wages and other socio-economic characteristics.The survey will also provide the household estimates of live-in/live-out domestic workers and an average number of domestic workers engaged by different types of households.The main objectives of the survey are to estimate the number/proportion of DWs at the national and state level; household estimates of live-in/ live-out DWs and to find out the average number of DWs engaged by different types of households.Under this survey, all 37 states and all 742 districts will be covered. At the All-India level, a total number of 12,766 first stage units (FSUs) i.e. 6,190 villages and 6,576 UFS blocks will be covered.The Domestic Worker Survey collects information on the following broad parameters, including household (HH) characteristics such as HH size, religion, social group, usual monthly consumption expenditure, nature of dwelling unit.Demographic characteristics, such as name, age, relation to head, marital status, general education level, usual principal activity status, subsidiary activity status and status of DWs.In addition to this, it will also collect information on DWs such as their age of entry, social group, migrant status, vocational training/education, number of HHs served by DW, activities performed by them, the number of days worked, duration of work, type of remuneration and its frequency, type of contract, among others.Information on Employer HHs is also collected such as their preferences of DW regarding gender and marital status, mode of payment of wages, the number of days worked, mode of engagement, whether DW services were availed during the COVID-19 pandemic, and medical support given to DWs.The result of the All-India Survey on Domestic Workers is expected within a time span of one year.The result of this survey will help the government understand the significant issues about certain special and vulnerable segments of labour and will guide effective policymaking in respect of domestic workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/domestic-workers-survey-flagged-off-instruction-manual-unveiled-101637571265744.html

22-11-2021||India||Australia welcomes vaccinated students, workers from Dec 1, Indians to benefit||Australia said on Monday it will allow fully vaccinated skilled migrants and international students holding valid visas to enter the country from December 1 without having to apply for a travel exemption, a move expected to benefit tens of thousands of Indians. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the move was in line with a national plan to safely reopen Australia, while “reuniting families and securing our economic recovery by opening our border to skilled and student visa holders”. The Indian side has been pressing Australia to open up travel for Indian nationals, especially students wishing to join courses at universities and educational institutions. India is the second largest source of foreign students in Australia, behind China. During 2019-20, Indian students contributed $6.6 billion to the Australian economy. “From 1 December 2021, fully vaccinated eligible visa holders can come to Australia without needing to apply for a travel exemption. Eligible visa holders include skilled and student cohorts, as well as humanitarian, working holiday maker and provisional family visa holders,” Morrison said in a statement. “The return of skilled workers and international students to Australia will further cement our economic recovery, providing the valuable workers our economy needs and supporting our important education sector,” he added. Under these arrangements, travellers must be fully vaccinated with a vaccine approved by Australia’s Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA). Both Covishield and Covaxin, the two main vaccines used in India’s immunisation programme, are recognised by TGA. Also Read: Singapore, India to resume flights under Vaccinated Travel Lane from Nov 29Travellers must also have a valid visa for one of the five eligible sub-classes, provide proof of their vaccination status, and present a negative Covid-19 PCR test taken within three days of departure.

Foreign nationals travelling to Australia must comply with quarantine requirements in Australian states or territories they are travelling to. Morrison also announced that from December 1, citizens of Japan and South Korea who hold a valid visa will be able to travel to Australia without needing to quarantine on arrival. Australian officials had earlier said foreign students, including Indians, would be able to start returning towards the end of this year and the beginning of 2022, ahead of the start of the first semester in February-March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/australia-welcomes-vaccinated-students-workers-from-dec-1-thousands-of-indians-to-benefit-101637569606648.html

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in an address to the nation on Gurpurab, announced the repeal of the agri laws and urged the farmers to withdraw their protests.At a kisan mahapanchayat convened by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of protesting farmer unions, the farmers also demanded the immediate resignation of Union home minister Ajay Mishra Teni, whose son Ashish has been arrested in connection with the Lakhimpur Kheri incident in which at least four ryots were killed last month."We don't trust the announcement made by the Prime Minister. We will believe that the farm laws are taken back only after we see a government gazette regarding it," said farm leader Joginder Singh Ugaraha."Ajay Mishra's family is the main accused of the Lakhimpur incident. His son is in jail but the Modi government has not asked him to resign yet," said Singh.Over a thousand farmers from several districts of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab have turned up at the kisan mahapanchayat being held at Eco Garden in Lucknow.Senior Bharat Kisan Union (BKU) leaders, including Rakesh Tikait and Balbir Singh Rajewala are addressing the gathering. Activist Yogendra Yadav is also attending the event.Tikait said the ongoing agitation along the borders of the national capital would continue until all farmers’ demands are met. “The government should bring a law to guarantee MSP (minimum support price) and announce 700 farmers who lost their lives during the struggle as martyrs," he said.Yadav said the Prime Minister is suffering from a disease of arrogance. "The people of Bengal gave him a small injection for this that proved effective slightly but he needs a bigger dose and that is the election of Uttar Pradesh," he said."I want to make this clear that the farmers' protest will continue till a law is formulated to guarantee MSP. The form of the protest will be decided by morcha," Yadav added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-believe-agri-law-rollback-once-gazette-is-issued-say-farmers-101637568892979.html

22-11-2021||India||MPs file dissent notes citing ‘reservations’ over Data Protection Bill report||Two Opposition Congress members of a parliamentary committee reviewing the Data Protection Bill have filed dissent notes citing a lack of oversight, failure to quantify penalties, absence of state-level data protection authorities (DPAs), and “unbridled” exemptions for the government as “reservations” to the panel’s final report. Jairam Ramesh and Gaurav Gogoi sent the dissent notes to the committee chairperson, PP Chaudhary, on Monday as the 30-member panel was due to adopt the final version of the report ahead of Parliament’s Winter Session beginning next week, people aware of the matter said.The people added Manish Tewari of the Congress, the Trinamool Congress’s Derek O’Brien and the Biju Janata Dal’s Amar Patnaik were likely to follow suit as the report is slated to be tabled during the session.“Today (Monday), the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Personal Data Protection Bill 2019 will adopt its report. I’m compelled to submit a detailed dissent note. But that should not detract from the democratic manner in which the Committee has functioned. Now, for the debate in Parliament,” Ramesh tweeted hours before the panel’s meeting was set to begin.Also Read: ‘Expect Winter Session to function smoothly’: Lok Sabha speaker Om BirlaRamesh filed his note contesting the exemptions to the government under Section 35 of the bill. He has argued the section provides unbridled power to exempt any of the government agencies from the proposed law. Ramesh added that Section 12, which covers non-consensual processing of data by the government, should have been made “less sweeping”.Gogoi cited a “lack of attention” paid to “harms arising from surveillance” and said a “modern surveillance framework” may be created. He also flagged concerns against Sections 35 and 12, along with a lack of “parliamentary oversight and engagement”. HT has seen a copy of Gogoi’s note. Gogoi noted the report has failed to “quantify penalties under the framework”.The people said Patnaik is likely to object to a lack of inclusion of state-level DAPs in the bill. The governments of Karnataka and Maharashtra sought this during the meetings of their representatives with the committee. In an interview with HT in September, Patnaik argued that the lack of state DPAs would raise issues of federal override.The panel has been looking into the draft law since 2019. It has been given several deadline extensions. The latest was due to changes in the panel after several of its members, including chairperson Meenakshi Lekhi, were inducted into the Union council of ministers in July.As per its summary, the report has proposed to treat social media platforms as publishers, which will make them liable for content posted by users. It has recommended adding back the condition of “just, fair, reasonable and proportionate” to Section 35, which deals with exemptions the government can claim in accessing personal data, one of the persons cited above said. This was of particular concern for the dissenters because the bill cleared by the government allowed it to claim an exemption as long as it felt it was “necessary or expedient” to do so in a particular set of circumstances such as those relating to national security. The “just, fair, reasonable and proportionate” portion was part of the first version of the bill, which was presented as per the recommendations of the Srikrishna Committee set up to recommend a legislative framework for data privacy in 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mps-file-dissent-notes-over-glaring-lacunae-in-report-on-data-protection-bill-101637566365637.html

The Shaurya Chakra awardees are Colonel Ajay Singh Kushwah, Lieutenant Colonel Jyoti Lama, Major Konjengbam Bijendra Singh, Major Maheshkumar Bhure, Naib Subedar Narender Singh, Havildar Alok Kumar Dubey, Naik Naresh Kumar and the Indian Navy’s Amit Singh Rana.Abhinandan’s citation read, “Displaying exceptional air combat acumen and knowledge of the enemy’s tactics, Abhinandan scanned the low altitude airspace with his airborne intercept (AI) radar and picked up an enemy aircraft that was flying low to ambush the Indian fighter interceptor aircraft… Abhinandan alerted the other formation pilots towards this surprise threat.”He was then a wing commander and promoted to the rank of group captain earlier this month. An IAF group captain is equivalent to an army colonel.Abhinandan, then 35, scripted military aviation history by downing an F-16, seconds before his own MiG-21 Bison was hit by a missile forcing him to eject. Experts had hailed it as the first ever kill of an F-16 by a MiG-21 Bison, fighter jets of two different generations. He was captured after he bailed out of his aircraft, but Pakistan returned him to India on March 1, 2019, after holding him captive for almost 60 hours.His Vir Chakra was announced on Independence Day 2019. The citation said, “Despite being captured by the enemy, he continued to display exceptional resolve in dealing with the adversary in a stoic, brave and dignified manner till he was repatriated on March 1, 2019.”In February 2019, Abhinandan was posted with a MiG-21 Bison squadron and was on “operational readiness platform” duty at air force station Srinagar when a large Pakistan Air Force fighter aircraft package was detected heading towards LoC. The hostile jets were armed with advanced beyond visual range (BVR) air-to-air missiles and modern air-to-ground standoff weapons.Abhinandan was scrambled to intercept this package five minutes after it was detected.“He then consolidated the riposte, by gathering his wingman in an offensive formation against the hostile Pakistani aircraft now dropping weapons on Indian Army positions. This audacious and aggressive manoeuvre forced the enemy aircraft into tactical chaos,” it further said.The citation said the wing commander then pursued a retreating enemy fighter aircraft and in the ensuing aerial combat, shot down an F-16. “However, in the melee, one of the enemy aircraft fired multiple advanced BVR missiles, one of which hit his aircraft forcing him to eject in enemy territory.”On February 26, the IAF’s Mirages hit three targets in Balakot with five Israeli-origin Spice 2000 bombs with penetrator warheads that allowed them to pierce through the rooftops before exploding inside to cause maximum damage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/president-kovind-awards-vir-chakra-to-abhinandan-varthaman-who-downed-pak-f16-101637563245211.html

It took place a day after the Indian Air Force’s Mirage-2000s struck targets in Pakistan’s Balakot. Varthaman's release was announced by Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, as “a peace gesture”.The 38-year-old, who is married and has two children, hails from Tamil Nadu's Tiruvannamalai district but completed his education in Delhi because his father - a decorated and senior officer of the IAF - was posted in the capital.His father, Air Marshal Simhakutty Varthaman, played a significant role during the 1999 Kargil conflict. His mother, Shobha, is a doctor.Abhinandan Varthaman is also an alumnus of Sainik School Amaravathinagar in Tamil Nadu.

However, the BJP rejected the allegations and blamed the TMC for attempts to “disturb peace” in Tripura.“ Hooligans and criminals are being brought from Bengal to disturb peace in Tripura. Now, a delegation of TMC is visiting Union home minister Amit Shah on Monday just to hide their own shortcomings. These are pre-planned conspiracies and we will tackle them in a disciplined and cool head way, “ Law minister Ratan Lal Nathtold reporters in Agartala in a late night press conference.Also Read: SC to hear TMC’s contempt plea on ‘worsening’ law and order in TripuraThe political tension in Tripura increased after violent incidents in the run-up to the Agartala Municipal Corporation (AMC) and 12 other municipal body elections, slated for November 25.

We are also ascertaining if any of our activists were involved in it,” said Nath.The CPM ,in a press statement, condemned Ghosh’s arrest and the attack on the TMC activists and said that opposition leaders and candidates have been attacked several times in the state but the police have not taken any action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-accuses-tmc-cpm-and-congress-of-shadow-alliance-in-tripura-101637562284986.html
22-11-2021||India||Drones figure in DGPs conference for manning troubled borders||Even as unarmed and armed drones figured in a big way in the DGPs conference in Lucknow for manning international borders this weekend, the Indian military is in the process of getting upgraded surveillance drones and examining the options of procuring armed drones from Israel.While the Indian Navy, the designated service for armed drones, is soon approaching the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) for acquiring 30 MQ-9B Predator drones from US, it is also examining the armed Heron TP drone from Israel for additional purchases.According to officials in knowledge of developments, a separate session on drone technology was held during the DGPs conference, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi part of the discussions. It was emphasised that India should be using drone technology for surveillance and response on the borders till such time the border infrastructure is upgraded to meet the future challenges posed by neighbours.Already, India is getting its surveillance Herons upgraded from Israel with advanced communication and data links, it is also examining the Heron TP, which virtually carries the same weapon payload as the Predator albeit has a larger radar cross-sector as compared to the US craft. The earlier plan of acquiring Heron TP on lease from Israel has apparently been shelved and there is a strong possibility of the craft being acquired from Israel on government-to-government basis.While indigenous design and development of surveillance and armed drones is work in progress, the regional security environment has changed with China stationing Wing Loong II armed drone at Ngari Gar Gunsa air base across the Demchok LAC in Ladakh. To complicate matter, China is also supplying the same drones to Pakistan with the possibility of technology transfer or joint development.If the issue with China is surveillance of the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the issue gets escalated on the western borders with Pakistan using drones for supplying weapons to terrorists with the aim of fomenting trouble in the Indian hinterland. Since 2019, the Pakistani deep state has chosen the low-cost option of not only supplying assault rifles and grenades to the terrorists in Kashmir and Punjab, they have also gone to the extent of targeting Jammu airbase with explosives this June. That the threat on western border is real becomes evident as the grenade used in the attack on Indian army establishment in Pathankot was part of the Pakistani drone consignment.At the DGPs conference, there were discussions and presentations on threat posed by radicalization and terrorism as well as the military challenge from China. The prognosis was that as India should use technologies like drones to manage the LAC as it cannot match border infrastructure put up by the Chinese PLA overnight with each military post connected by road and optical fiber for better response and decision making on the spot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drones-figure-in-dgp-conference-for-manning-troubled-borders-101637560316006.html

If he is non-partisan, he will definitely help us out.”Gokhale said the main issue the TMC delegates want to discuss with Shah is about the party’s youth wing president in Tripura, Sayani Ghosh, who has been charged with attempt to murder, among other things, for raising the party slogan “khela hobe (game on)”.

A cyclonic circulation is lying over southern Andaman Sea and its surrounding areas at lower tropospheric level. It is likely to move west-northwestwards during next four to five days.In association with the cyclonic circulation, light to moderate rainfall is likely over parts of Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry in the next five days.

Delhi’s air quality was in the ‘very poor’ category on Monday morning with the hourly air quality index (AQI) at 7 am reaching 314, as per the data from the Central Pollution Control Board.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.The Union ministry of earth science’s air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) had said that transport level winds were likely to stay strong till 23rd noon and with the farm fire counts educing rapidly, the percent share of stubble burning related pollutants to Delhi’s PM2.5 may remain low. Also Read: Kejriwal to begin 2-day visit to Punjab, will make big announcements in MogaRelatively high surface winds and moderate mixing layer height results in efficient ventilation of near surface pollutants. Net effect of drastic reduction in fire counts and increase of surface wind speed tend to improve the air quality, it had added. According to Safar’s projection, from 24th onwards, a likely drop in air temperature as well as surface wind speed may lead to less dispersion of pollutants. However, transport level winds’ speed was likely to reduce keeping the air quality in the upper end of ‘poor’ to lower end of ‘very poor’ category.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhis-air-quality-is-in-very-poor-category-101637549623568.html
22-11-2021||India||Facebook convinced poll panel to settle on a voluntary code||In the run-up to the 2019 general elections, internal Facebook documents say it managed to convince the Election Commission of India (ECI) to scuttle its original intention of introducing stiff social media regulations and settle for a voluntary code of ethics, avoiding additional legal obligations. The social media company fronted the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) to push its view and achieve consensus over the rules, Facebook’s internal documents spirited out of the company by whistleblower Frances Haugen show.The ECI, the documents show and former government officials independently confirmed, wanted a strict social media regulatory framework, perhaps not a fresh legislation (or an amendment to an existing one) in time for the elections.The EC spokesperson said that it wasn’t familiar with Facebook’s internal report, but the claim doesn’t seem to be correct. “Political advertisement on electronic media including social media is always prohibited during the silence period. Section 126(1)(b) of R.P. Act 1951 prohibits display of any election matter (including political advertisement) by means of television or similar apparatus (electronic media) during the period of 48 hours ending with the hour fixed for conclusion of poll,” the EC spokesperson told HT and The Intersection.“And as per the VCE (voluntary code of ethics), platforms had committed to act upon the violations of section 126 of R.P. Act, 1951. For this they had created a dedicated reporting mechanism for ECI under the provisions of VCE.”A Meta spokesperson, in an emailed response to The Intersection and The Hindustan Times said, “Promoting election integrity in India isn’t something we can do alone. Ahead of 2019 general elections, we joined other social media companies in a voluntary code of ethics for the general elections with the Election Commission of India (ECI).”Election integrityIn July 2018, the Commission set up a committee led by the then deputy election commissioner Umesh Sinha to suggest such a framework. In its draft report, accessed by The Intersection and HT, the committee recommended that “the Commission may issue directions to social media agencies to ensure that political advertisements are not uploaded on their platforms during the prohibited period of 48 hours mentioned in Section 126”.While the original scope of the committee, which submitted its report in January 2019, was to “look into social media regulation during the poll period”, it eventually zeroed in on the last 48 hours before the actual voting, or what is known as the “silence period”. The recommendations contained in the draft report are previously unreported.Also Read: Delhi Assembly panel asks Facebook to submit records on complaints on 2020 riotsOn 29 May 2019, five days after the Indian general elections drew to a close, officials from Facebook’s civic integrity team shot off a memo to the rest of the company. It was an after-action report of sorts, detailing everything the company had done during the polls; from proactive monitoring to taking action on content flagged by the ECI and driving the Voluntary Code of Ethics (VCE) that governed social media platforms.It was a big relief for the Menlo Park, California-based company which was just coming off a bruising scandal involving the controversial election management company Cambridge Analytica. Facebook (now Meta Platforms), the memo shows, was determined to avoid onerous legal obligations. It wanted to do the minimum to be able to dodge any backlash later, former Facebook officials told The Intersection and HT.Outlined in part one of a document titled “India Elections: A Case Study”, it included, among other platform-specific goals such as fighting misinformation and fake news, the prevention of “any bad regulation or law for social media on election integrity”.These details are from disclosures made to the Securities and Exchange Commission and to the US Congress in a redacted form by Haugen’s legal counsel. The redacted versions received by Congress were reviewed by a consortium of news organizations, including The Intersection, which is publishing a series of stories based on the documents and in partnership with The Hindustan Times.No ads, pleaseFacebook, multiple people confirmed, aggressively pushed back against the EC’s plan to require it to disable ads during the silence period. This was despite suggestions by the Sinha committee, to “consider the possibility of blocking posting of election advertisements during the period of the last 48 hours…” The social network, the people confirmed, was also the “most vocal and driving things” in meetings between industry body IAMAI and the ECI.Referring to a March 23, 2019 notification, the EC spokesperson reiterated that “TV/Radio channels and cable networks/internet website /social media platforms should ensure that the contents of the programmes telecast/broadcast/ displayed by them during the period of 48 hours referred to in Section 126 do not contain any material, including views/appeals by panelists/participants that may be construed as promoting/ prejudicing the prospect of any particular party or candidate(s) or influencing/ affecting the result of the election”. This, among other things also included display of any opinion poll and of standard debates, analysis, visuals and sound-bytes.It was also party to a public interest litigation in the Bombay High Court to enforce campaign silence for social media companies. “With the help of the Voluntary Code of Ethics and continued engagement with ECI, we were able to avoid an onerous and prescriptive direction from the Bombay High Court,” an internal Facebook memo said. The VCE was a potent instrument that Facebook used to blunt any new binding commitments.In a section titled “Code of Ethics Election Commission: The Incredibles”, Facebook notes, “This [VCE] was a significant development which helped our family of apps to continue working within the existing legal framework without attracting any new election law or attracting bad regulation.” Under the code, it created a high-priority channel for notice and take-down after receiving valid legal orders. That meant the onus of flagging content shifted to the ECI and Facebook merely carried out its instructions.Sahana Udupa, professor of media anthropology at University of Munich and a Joan Shorenstein Fellow at Harvard University, told The Intersection over phone, “The voluntary code that was drawn (up) during the 2019 general elections was weak and insufficient, not least because of the very manner in which it was created.”Facebook was alarmed that the ECI was planning to introduce a regulatory framework for platforms requiring them to proactively monitor and remove content, including disabling all ads during the silence period. “They also wanted us to pro-actively inform users on Silence period related Election laws for every round of polling.” In the end, the VCE merely said that participants will commit to following transparency in paid political advertising and instituted a mechanism to fast-track the ECI’s action requests.Writing in the memo, a Facebook official said, “We ensured our primary trade body IAMAI was involved to negotiate on behalf of the industry so that no bad recommendation was made. Eventually, we managed to get a text which was in line with intermediary protection for tech platforms.” Despite repeated requests, IAMAI remained unavailable for comment.Udupa said by negotiating with the ECI through an entity like the IAMAI, social media companies secured the buffer of an association to agree to a voluntary code. “Such double distancing on the part of the social media companies—first from being direct parties and second from enforceable obligation—showed that the voluntary code arrangement was weak from its very inception.”In sharp contrast, even though there is no concept of a silence period in the US, Facebook disabled fresh political ads on its platforms for a seven-day period before the 2020 presidential elections. A former Facebook official said that the company says it wants regulation, but in reality “they’re trying to shape regulation to what works best for them”.The ECI pulled one back on removal of content. Facebook’s original position on content takedowns, multiple sources confirmed, was a maximum duration of 72 hours, in line with the then version of the IT Act of 2000. The Sinha committee wanted it in 24 hours. An EC official told The Intersection and HT that while there was demand from social media companies to increase the time for take-down of content. The Commission held firm, asking them to remove any flagged material within three hours. Ultimately, it came down to two hours.Just a codeIt worked in Facebook’s favour that the Election Commission was pressed for time. An amendment to the legislation governing the elections, the Representation of People Act, 1951, the ECI official added would have taken a while to go through Parliament. A voluntary code therefore was a fair idea. “At that stage, it was considered that an amendment would take time to process, and thus, the voluntary code was considered a better via-media,” the ECI official said.“Our priority was to have a framework where grievances were expeditiously addressed and one that all social media companies abide by.”A former EC official who worked on the voluntary code said on condition of anonymity that it was beyond the mandate of the Commission to frame a law. “The Commission doesn’t make the laws. Whatever compliance is required must be anchored in a law and as such the EC had made recommendations to the IT ministry what to include.”To be sure, the Sinha Committee report recommended the insertion of the term “election matter” to the draft Information Technology [Intermediaries Guidelines (Amendment) Rules, 2018], to “suitably to address the concern of misuse of social media for the purposes of elections, particularly during the prohibitory period.”In September 2019, the ECI mandated that the VCE would be in use in all future elections, including the ones to elect legislative assemblies. At the time, Haryana and Maharashtra were going to polls.While the code had served its purpose, a senior IT ministry official told The Intersection and HT fresh legislation was required as it was no longer about the bigger platforms. “It is applicable to everyone, the smaller ones too. And if there is no legislation, the code should be evolutionary in nature, and reflect changes in prevailing conditions,” he said.(Venkat Ananth is a co-founder at The Intersection published by The Signal, www.thesignal.co)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/facebook-convinced-poll-panel-to-settle-on-a-voluntary-code-101637549263683.html

22-11-2021||India||SC to hear pleas accusing Twitter of promoting fake news, anti-India content||The Supreme Court is expected to hear pleas today seeking directions to the government to bring in legislation enabling the prosecution of Twitter for alleged “anti-India tweets”. One of the pleas has sought the framing of a mechanism that could check advertisements and paid content on Twitter that may be hateful or seditious and to rein in social media accounts "in order to stop the hatred, fake, investigative and other news which are contrary to the law of the country or violates the law of the country".Former national co-convener of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) IT cell Vinit Goenka, advocates Vinit Jindal, Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay and others had filed petitions in the apex court on the issue. The court issued a notice to the Central government in February and tagged Goenka’s plea along with another similar matter pending before the top court. A bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar and CT Ravikumar will hear pleas today.In his plea, Goenka alleged that the social media company is sympathetic to terrorist groups and promotes tweets that are “anti-India” and amount to waging war against the Union. The plea claimed that fake Twitter handles are used to"propagate casteism, communalism, regionalism, linguism, radicalism, and separatism, which endanger fraternity, unity and regional integration."It also mentioned Twitter’s refusal to block Twitter handles allegedly involved in promoting fake and provocative content. The petition stated that social media platforms, in the absence of any law to deal with offensive and hatred messages, "knowingly” promote messages which are “against the law of the land.”Advocate Vinit Jindal had sought directions for the central government to formulate laws that regulate and enforce accountability on social media platforms for spreading hate speech and fake news. He also sought directions to frame criminal prosecutions on those who are involved in spreading fake news or hate via social media channels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-to-hear-pleas-accusing-twitter-of-promoting-fake-news-anti-india-content-101637542159239.html
22-11-2021||India||UK rules recognising Covaxin for inbound travel come into effect from today||The changes announced by the United Kingdom, adding India's Covaxin to the list of approved Covid-19 vaccines for international travellers, will come into effect from November 22. This means that thousands of travellers from India, who have been inoculated with the Bharat Biotech-manufactured jab, will not have to self-isolate after arrival in Britain.The UK government has also added China’s Sinovac and Sinopharm in its list of approved vaccines, benefiting fully vaccinated people from the United Arab Emirates and Malaysia too. Around one billion doses of these three Covid-19 vaccines have been delivered worldwide.The changes were announced earlier this month, after the World Health Organization (WHO) cleared their “emergency-use listing”. The WHO issued an emergency-use listing for Covaxin on November 3.The UK began recognising Covishield, the Indian version of the AstraZeneca vaccine, for inbound travel from October 4.It also began accepting India’s vaccine certificates from October 11, ending a travel row that had resulted in UK nationals facing mandatory 10-day quarantine on arrival even if they were fully vaccinated.Covishield and Covaxin are the two main vaccines being used for India's immunisation programme. The country has also approved Russia-made Sputnik and Johnson & Johnson's single-dose vaccine.Last week, government officials said that as many as 110 countries have given recognition to Covaxin and Covishield, according to news agency ANI. Among these countries are New Zealand and Australia.Covaxin and Covishield were the first two jabs to receive emergency use authorisation (EUA) from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) for the nationwide inoculation drive, which commenced on January 16. The former has been developed by the Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech International Limited, and is the first made-in-India anti-Covid shot. The latter is the Indian variant of Britain's AstraZeneca vaccine, and manufactured locally by the Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uk-rules-recognising-covaxin-for-inbound-travel-come-into-effect-from-today-101637542215651.html

Wankhede has repeatedly denied the claims and released caste certificates of several of his family members, showing they are Mahars, a Scheduled Caste.The high court reserved an order last Thursday on the interim application filed by Wankhede’s father Dnyandev pertaining to the temporary injunction against Malik. Dnyandev Wankhede had filed a defamation suit against Malik and urged the court to restrain the Maharashtra minister from posting defamatory statements against him and his family on social media.Sameer Wankhede runs bar, hid info from department, alleges Nawab MalikOn November 12, the high court had reserved its order on the interim relief aspect in Dnyandev’s defamation suit but, a few days later, Malik moved the court seeking its permission to place on record additional documents. Malik submitted a letter by the public health officer of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) with a copy of the declaration regarding Wankhede’s rechristening, and two school leaving certificates. The minister claimed that these documents showed Wankhede was born a Muslim and his father’s real name was Dawood and not Dnyandev.Dnyandev Wankhede's counsel, advocate Arshad Shaikh, argued that Wankhede's birth certificate had initially mistakenly mentioned his father's name as Dawood, but the same had been corrected "way back". Shaikh told the high court that Malik must stop calling Dnyandev as Dawood."He (Malik) should not continue to call me Dawood since it was corrected to Dnyandev way back. Somehow, for the last four days, he kept quiet. Then he has started again," said Shaikh. "Whether his birth certificate is right or mine that has to be seen," he told the high court.The court directed both parties to refrain from submitting any fresh documents until it pronounces its order on November 22.Sameer Wankhede has been at the forefront of recent NCB investigations involving the film industry, including the drugs-on-cruise case and a drug probe linked to Sushant Singh Rajput’s death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-bombay-hc-order-nawab-malik-s-bombshell-what-did-you-do-sameer-dawood-wankhede-101637540769176.html

Supreme Court expected to get the answer today||The Supreme Court is expected to get a response today from the lawyer of former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh about his whereabouts. The top court had made it clear during the last hearing on Thursday that it will not entertain Singh's plea for protection against arrest in an alleged extortion case until his location is known.The bench headed by justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul had Singh's lawyer on November 18 that his petition will be heard "only after he tells which part of the country or the world he is in"."No protection, no hearing till we have the answer to the question - where are you?" the bench told Singh's counsel, who then sought time till Monday to get instructions.The top court also took exception that Singh's plea seeking protection has been filed through the power-of-attorney holder.The complainant, restaurateur Bimal Agarwal, alleged that the accused extorted ₹11.92 lakh from him by threatening to register cases against two of his outlets - Boho Restaurant and BCB Bar.Singh, the second most senior Indian Police Service (IPS) serving officer in Maharashtra, was declared a proclaimed offender by a Mumbai court on Wednesday after he remained elusive since March this year and did not show up before the trial court despite several notices and warrants issued against him.This was the first instance of a Mumbai police commissioner being declared a proclaimed offender. Singh, 59, was the city's 43rd police commissioner.Currently posted as Director General of Home Guards, Singh last attended his office in May, after which he went on leave. The state police had told the Bombay high court in October that his whereabouts were not known.The petition was filed against the September 16 judgment of the Bombay high court, which had dismissed the petition filed by Singh challenging two preliminary inquiries initiated against him by the Maharashtra government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/where-is-param-bir-singh-supreme-court-expected-to-get-the-answer-today-101637538388243.html
22-11-2021||India||Facebook lobbied over poll rules: Papers||In the run-up to the 2019 general elections, internal Facebook documents say it managed to convince the Election Commission of India (ECI) to scuttle its original intention of introducing stiff social media regulations and settle for a voluntary code of ethics, avoiding additional legal obligations. The social media company fronted the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) to push its view and achieve consensus over the rules, Facebook’s internal documents spirited out of the company by whistleblower Frances Haugen show.The ECI, the documents show and former government officials independently confirmed, wanted a strict social media regulatory framework, perhaps not a fresh legislation (or an amendment to an existing one) in time for the elections.The EC spokesperson said that it wasn’t familiar with Facebook’s internal report, but the claim doesn’t seem to be correct. “Political advertisement on electronic media including social media is always prohibited during the silence period. Section 126(1)(b) of R.P. Act 1951 prohibits display of any election matter (including political advertisement) by means of television or similar apparatus (electronic media) during the period of 48 hours ending with the hour fixed for conclusion of poll,” the EC spokesperson told HT.“And as per the VCE (voluntary code of ethics), platforms had committed to act upon the violations of section 126 of R.P. Act, 1951. For this they had created a dedicated reporting mechanism for ECI under the provisions of VCE.”A Meta spokesperson, in an emailed response to The Intersection and The Hindustan Times said, “Promoting election integrity in India isn’t something we can do alone. Ahead of 2019 general elections, we joined other social media companies in a voluntary code of ethics for the general elections with the Election Commission of India (ECI).”Election integrityIn July 2018, the Commission set up a committee led by the then deputy election commissioner Umesh Sinha to suggest such a framework. In its draft report, accessed by The Intersection and HT, the committee recommended that “the Commission may issue directions to social media agencies to ensure that political advertisements are not uploaded on their platforms during the prohibited period of 48 hours mentioned in Section 126”.While the original scope of the committee, which submitted its report in January 2019, was to “look into social media regulation during the poll period”, it eventually zeroed in on the last 48 hours before the actual voting, or what is known as the “silence period”. The recommendations contained in the draft report are previously unreported.On 29 May 2019, five days after the Indian general elections drew to a close, officials from Facebook’s civic integrity team shot off a memo to the rest of the company. It was an after-action report of sorts, detailing everything the company had done during the polls; from proactive monitoring to taking action on content flagged by the ECI and driving the Voluntary Code of Ethics (VCE) that governed social media platforms.It was a big relief for the Menlo Park, California-based company which was just coming off a bruising scandal involving the controversial election management company Cambridge Analytica. Facebook (now Meta Platforms), the memo shows, was determined to avoid onerous legal obligations. It wanted to do the minimum to be able to dodge any backlash later, former Facebook officials told The Intersection and HT.Outlined in part one of a document titled “India Elections: A Case Study”, it included, among other platform-specific goals such as fighting misinformation and fake news, the prevention of “any bad regulation or law for social media on election integrity”.These details are from disclosures made to the Securities and Exchange Commission and to the US Congress in a redacted form by Haugen’s legal counsel. The redacted versions received by Congress were reviewed by a consortium of news organizations, including The Intersection, which is publishing a series of stories based on the documents and in partnership with The Hindustan Times.No, ads pleaseFacebook, multiple people confirmed, aggressively pushed back against the EC’s plan to require it to disable ads during the silence period. This was despite suggestions by the Sinha committee, to “consider the possibility of blocking posting of election advertisements during the period of the last 48 hours…” The social network, the people confirmed, was also the “most vocal and driving things” in meetings between industry body IAMAI and the ECI.Referring to a March 23, 2019 notification, the EC spokesperson reiterated that “TV/Radio channels and cable networks/internet website /social media platforms should ensure that the contents of the programmes telecast/broadcast/ displayed by them during the period of 48 hours referred to in Section 126 do not contain any material, including views/appeals by panelists/participants that may be construed as promoting/ prejudicing the prospect of any particular party or candidate(s) or influencing/ affecting the result of the election”. This, among other things also included display of any opinion poll and of standard debates, analysis, visuals and sound-bytes.It was also party to a public interest litigation in the Bombay High Court to enforce campaign silence for social media companies. “With the help of the Voluntary Code of Ethics and continued engagement with ECI, we were able to avoid an onerous and prescriptive direction from the Bombay High Court,” an internal Facebook memo said. The VCE was a potent instrument that Facebook used to blunt any new binding commitments.In a section titled “Code of Ethics Election Commission: The Incredibles”, Facebook notes, “This [VCE] was a significant development which helped our family of apps to continue working within the existing legal framework without attracting any new election law or attracting bad regulation.” Under the code, it created a high-priority channel for notice and take-down after receiving valid legal orders. That meant the onus of flagging content shifted to the ECI and Facebook merely carried out its instructions.Sahana Udupa, professor of media anthropology at University of Munich and a Joan Shorenstein Fellow at Harvard University, told The Intersection over phone, “The voluntary code that was drawn (up) during the 2019 general elections was weak and insufficient, not least because of the very manner in which it was created.”Facebook was alarmed that the ECI was planning to introduce a regulatory framework for platforms requiring them to proactively monitor and remove content, including disabling all ads during the silence period. “They also wanted us to pro-actively inform users on Silence period related Election laws for every round of polling.” In the end, the VCE merely said that participants will commit to following transparency in paid political advertising and instituted a mechanism to fast-track the ECI’s action requests.Writing in the memo, a Facebook official said, “We ensured our primary trade body IAMAI was involved to negotiate on behalf of the industry so that no bad recommendation was made. Eventually, we managed to get a text which was in line with intermediary protection for tech platforms.” Despite repeated requests, IAMAI remained unavailable for comment.Udupa said by negotiating with the ECI through an entity like the IAMAI, social media companies secured the buffer of an association to agree to a voluntary code. “Such double distancing on the part of the social media companies—first from being direct parties and second from enforceable obligation—showed that the voluntary code arrangement was weak from its very inception.”In sharp contrast, even though there is no concept of a silence period in the US, Facebook disabled fresh political ads on its platforms for a seven-day period before the 2020 presidential elections. A former Facebook official said that the company says it wants regulation, but in reality “they’re trying to shape regulation to what works best for them”.The ECI pulled one back on removal of content. Facebook’s original position on content takedowns, multiple sources confirmed, was a maximum duration of 72 hours, in line with the then version of the IT Act of 2000. The Sinha committee wanted it in 24 hours. An EC official told The Intersection and HT that while there was demand from social media companies to increase the time for take-down of content. The Commission held firm, asking them to remove any flagged material within three hours. Ultimately, it came down to two hours.Just a codeIt worked in Facebook’s favour that the Election Commission was pressed for time. An amendment to the legislation governing the elections, the Representation of People Act, 1951, the ECI official added would have taken a while to go through Parliament. A voluntary code therefore was a fair idea. “At that stage, it was considered that an amendment would take time to process, and thus, the voluntary code was considered a better via-media,” the ECI official said.“Our priority was to have a framework where grievances were expeditiously addressed and one that all social media companies abide by.”A former EC official who worked on the voluntary code said on condition of anonymity that it was beyond the mandate of the Commission to frame a law. “The Commission doesn’t make the laws. Whatever compliance is required must be anchored in a law and as such the EC had made recommendations to the IT ministry what to include.”To be sure, the Sinha Committee report recommended the insertion of the term “election matter” to the draft Information Technology [Intermediaries Guidelines (Amendment) Rules, 2018], to “suitably to address the concern of misuse of social media for the purposes of elections, particularly during the prohibitory period.”In September 2019, the ECI mandated that the VCE would be in use in all future elections, including the ones to elect legislative assemblies. At the time, Haryana and Maharashtra were going to polls.While the code had served its purpose, a senior IT ministry official told The Intersection and HT fresh legislation was required as it was no longer about the bigger platforms. “It is applicable to everyone, the smaller ones too. And if there is no legislation, the code should be evolutionary in nature, and reflect changes in prevailing conditions,” he said.(Venkat Ananth is a co-founder at The Intersection published by The Signal, www.thesignal.co)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fb-lobbied-over-poll-rules-papers-101637530999072.html
22-11-2021||India||Rain-hit Andhra limps back to normal, 17 still missing||The south-coastal and Rayalaseema districts of Andhra Pradesh have limped back to normal after rainfall that wreaked havoc in the region gave the state some respite on Sunday.The state disaster management authority (SDMA) in an official bulletin in the evening said the death toll was 24 but the fate of 17 people believed to have been washed away in the floods in Kadapa, Chittoor, Anantapur and Nellore is still not known.“There has been no trace of 11 people, who were washed away in the floods of Cheyyeru River due to a breach of the Annamayya reservoir near Pulaputhur village of Nandalur block in Kadapa district. Four teams of NDRF and three of SDRF are still on the rescue operations,” the bulletin said.Four people in Chittoor and one each in Anantapur and Nellore are also still missing.“There has been very scanty and scattered rainfall in these four districts, ranging from 0.02 mm in Chittoor to 1.7 mm in Nellore. However, there was 4 mm rainfall in Kurnool,” the SDMA bulletin said.The flood fury continued to ravage Kadapa, Nellore and Chittoor districts, due to the heavy rainfall in the last three days. The bridge over Papagni River in Kamalapuram block of Kadapa district collapsed, bringing traffic to a halt on this road.In Chittoor district, a high alert was sounded in several villages like Mullapudi, Padipeta, Kuntrapakam, Tanapalli, Balijepalli and Gangireddipalli, as the Rayalacheruvu irrigation tank of Ramachandrapuram block is on the brink of a breach. Though the officials have been trying to plug the breach, they evacuated thousands of people from these villages to safer places.There are reports of at least three causeways on the Swarnamukhi river in Chittoor district getting washed away, cutting road links to as many as 30 villages. The officials said that it would take at least 20 days to restore the road connections.In the temple town of Tirupati, several colonies are still submerged. The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam (TTD) authorities, however, restored the traffic on both the ghat roads to Tirumala to facilitate pilgrims to get a darshan of Lord Venkateshwara.In Nellore district, the Penna river has been overflowing for the last three two days, inundating as many as 29 villages. Even in Nellore town, several colonies remained submerged on Sunday.The SDMA authorities said as many as 181 blocks, 1366 villages and four towns were affected due to heavy rains in the last two days, displacing over 36,000 people. As many as 2007 houses were damaged and 1,137 houses are still submerged in waters.The officials have shifted 31,827 people to 274 relief camps, where they are being provided with food and water. “According to preliminary estimates, agricultural crop in 2.41 lakh hectares and horticulture crop in 1.86 lakh hectares were totally damaged,” the bulletin said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rainhit-andhra-limps-back-to-normal-17-still-missing-101637526340423.html
22-11-2021||India||At 1.53%, Assam conviction rate lags behind the national average: NCRB||GUWAHATI The conviction rate in Assam paints a dismal picture of law enforcement in the state as merely 1.53% of those charged with IPC (Indian Penal Code) offences get convicted, against a national average of 14.35%, data for 2020 from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) showed.According to the NCRB report, 133,641 people were arrested in Assam for IPC crimes last year, of which charge sheets were filed against 61,668 but only 949 got convicted. Courts acquitted 15,919 of those arrested and 208 were discharged. “One prime reason for this is faulty and unscientific investigation. There’s also a lot of pressure on policemen who besides doing investigation are responsible for maintaining law and order and other duties,” said a former DGP of the state, wishing not to be named.“Slow pace of trial is another factor as sometimes witnesses retract from their earlier statements or turn hostile after a few months or years. Lawyers involved in prosecution should be more professional and the tendency to file frivolous cases or several cases for one incident also needs to be curbed,” he said.The conviction rate for crimes under special and local laws (SLL) in Assam is also very low. While the all-India rate stood at 34.16%, in Assam the conviction rate for SLL crimes in 2020 was just 1.36%, said the NCRB report. In 2020, a total of 12,482 persons were arrested under SLL in the state. Charge sheets were filed against 5,564 of them and only 76 of them ended up getting convicted. The courts acquitted the accused in 1,128 cases and discharged one. “The total strength of Assam police is very low and as there is no division of investigation, law and order and security duties, the same policeman ends up doing all of these tasks, which results in improper investigation. There’s a problem with infrastructure as well,” said noted lawyer Nekibur Zaman. “The state doesn’t have a fully equipped forensic sciences laboratory. There is also a lack of proper training for policemen to conduct scientific investigation. In some cases, charge sheets are not filed on time, which results in criminals getting bail and influencing witnesses,” he added. Zaman said while the judiciary is doing its bit, police also need to ensure delivery of summons on time and produce exhibits on schedule in courts. He blamed the state government for appointing prosecution lawyers on political considerations and not giving them adequate support. In 2020, a total of 146,123 persons were arrested under IPC and SLL crimes in Assam. Charge sheets were filed against 67,232 of them. Of them, 1,025 got convicted, 209 were discharged and 17,047 acquitted. The conviction rate for the state was 1.52% of those charge sheeted in comparison to the national figure of 21.63%. While conviction rates were low, the figures for recidivism (the tendency of persons arrested/convicted in past to commit crimes again) in Assam were better than the all-India numbers. In IPC cases, the rate of recidivism in Assam was 1.4% while the national figure was 4.8%. In SLL crimes, 4% of those arrested in 2020 were found to be repeat offenders in contrast to the all-India figure of 5% for such crimes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-1-53-assam-conviction-rate-lags-behind-the-national-average-ncrb-101637522740025.html
22-11-2021||India||Kerala adoption row: Andhra couple hand over baby, DNA test to be held||A baby who was allegedly given away for adoption without the mother’s consent was handed over to a joint team of Kerala Child Welfare Council and Kerala Police on Saturday by the foster parents, a couple from Andhra Pradesh who were given its custody in August this year.The baby will be brought to Thiruvananthapuram by Sunday evening and a DNA test will be held on Monday to identify its biological parents, a senior official of the social welfare ministry said.Last week, the Kerala Child Welfare Committee, a quasi-judicial body, ordered authorities to produce the baby in five days and conduct a DNA test to decide biological parents, following a petition filed by 23-year-old Anupama S Chandran, a former leader of the Students Federation of India (SFI), who has alleged that her boy born in October 2020 was secretively given away for adoption by her parents.The team comprising three senior officials of the child welfare council and three police officers, including a woman officer, is expected to return in the state capital on late on Sunday. The Kerala Child Welfare Committee had ordered a senior police officer to give protection to the child till a final decision is taken. According to reports in local media, the Andhra couple returned the baby and reportedly told the team that they would be happy if the child finds his real parents.“I am really relieved. Our six-month struggle evoked some results. But I have a reservation that same department officials who gave my baby for adoption flouting all norms were given charge of bringing him back,” said Chandran, adding that she will continue her stand-in protest outside the office of the state council of child welfare till officials who allegedly colluded with her parents get punished.The whole issue came to light after a police case was registered on October 20 after Chandran filed a complaint alleging that her parents forcibly took away her baby soon after its birth last year and gave it for adoption, bypassing her request to live with the newborn. Later, police registered a case against six people, including her parents.In her complaint, Chandran alleged that her father, S Jayachandran, a senior leader of the CPI(M) trade union wing CITU, took away her newborn child and handed it over to the Kerala State Council for Child Welfare-run orphanage in the state capital in October last year. The child was reportedly given to a family from Andhra Pradesh in a hurry, flouting adoption rules, she claimed in her complaint.Her father, Jayachandran, said since the baby was born out of wedlock they decided to shift to the government-run children’s home in the state capital with the consent of his daughter. He said she signed on stamp paper but Anupama later said she signed under duress. She said her parents opposed her relations with her husband Ajith since he belonged to a Dalit family. But her parents alleged that Ajith was already married and the child was born out of wedlock.The issue turned into a massive controversy cornering the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the state government. Many writers and left intellectuals appealed to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan to intervene, but he is yet to react while his party has maintained its stand that it was a “family affair”. During a recent assembly debate too, Vijayan skirted the issue. However, state fisheries minister Saji Cherian criticised Chandran justifying her parents. “Her parents have done only what everyone will do in the society,” he said. Later, Chandran filed defamation compliant against the minister.Chandran said she approached many including party politburo members and the CM but failed to get justice and forced to hit the street after all attempts failed. Legal experts said even after the DNA test she will have to wait till a court quashes the earlier adoption certificate and other formalities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-adoption-row-andhra-couple-hand-over-baby-dna-test-to-be-held-101637522380130.html

Recoveries outnumbered new infections with 847 people getting discharged in last 24 hours, aggregating to 2,675,174 leaving 8,722 active infections, a bulletin said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-1-8-million-get-jabs-in-tamil-nadu-in-10th-mega-drive-101637522319901.html
22-11-2021||India||Brother of former Miss Kerala runner-up seeks probe into car crash||The brother of former 2019 Miss Kerala runner-up Anjana Shajan, who, along with two others, died in a car accident, filed a complaint with the Kochi Police on Sunday and sought a detailed probe into the circumstances which led to the accident.In the complaint, Arjun Shajan has asked the police to probe the role of Roy Joseph, owner of the hotel where the models participated in a party and one Shaju Thankachan who followed them in his luxurious car after the party. “Some of the emerging details are serious. We want a thorough probe into the role of hotel owner Roy Joseph and Thankachan,” Arjun said in Kochi. Earlier, the parents of former Miss Kerala Ansy Kabeer, another accident victim, also filed a similar police complaint.During the investigation, the police found that the car was being tailed by an Audi car. Moreover, CCTV visuals from the hotel in Kochi were missing. During the probe, the police also found that employees retrieved the storage disk of the party area, as directed by the owner, and threw it into backwaters later.Sixteen days after the tragic deaths, the police arrested the hotel owner Joseph and five employees where the late-night party was held after two days of intense questioning. They got bail the next day.A senior police officer of the port city said they were arrested on charges of destroying evidence (section 204 of the IPC) and rash and negligent driving amounting to culpable homicide (section 304).Initially, the police booked the driver Abdul Rehman under section 304 of the Indian Penal Code. There were charges against the police that they are under pressure to go slow in the case, and driver Rehman was trying to hide vital information about the incident. Rehman remains in the hospital owing to his injuries but in under judicial custody, the police said.The fatal mishap took place on November 1 at around 1.30 am when the driver hit a tree on the roadside to save a motorbike rider in front of them. The car mangled in the impact, and it took some time for the rescuers to retrieve the trapped, the police said. Both Ansy and Anjana died on the spot while their friend Mohammad Ashiq, an advertising professional, died after a week. The driver escaped with minor injuries, the police added.Ansy was crowned Miss Kerala in 2019. In the same competition, Anjana ended as runner-up. After the accident, Ansy’s mother, unable to withstand her daughter’s tragic end, tried to die suicide but was saved by her relatives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/brother-of-former-miss-kerala-runner-up-seeks-probe-into-car-crash-101637522139982.html
22-11-2021||India||Dhinakaran banks on Sasikala to regain key role in AIADMK||V K Sasikala’s renewed political journey has in effect given TTV Dhinakaran another shot to play a role as the future of the political party in Tamil Nadu, but experts said if the AMMK founder continues to hope that he and his aunt can reclaim the AIADMK, his political performance would dwindle further. “There is no doubt that Sasikala rehabilitated him and made him number one in command in the AIADMK before she went to prison, but much water has flown under the bridge since then,” said political commentator Raveendran Duraisamy. “The 2.5% that AMMK got in 2021 is in favour of Dhinakaran’s character, his way of giving interviews. With that, he and Sasikala are aiming to reclaim the AIADMK, which has a 33% vote share. It is better if Dhinakaran keeps to himself and aligns with the UPA or NDA alliance in the 2024 elections. His vote share can convert into seats. Sasikala will only pull him down.” Dhinakaran’s place in Tamil Nadu politics was once touted to be the future of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), when he succeeded late J Jayalalithaa as the MLA of R K Nagar Assembly constituency in Chennai in 2017, at the height of his rebellion against the current leadership. Since then, he faced successive defeats and remained anonymous. His political future is inadvertently tied to the destiny of Sasikala, an all-powerful woman behind the scene when Jayalalithaa was alive – a position she lost after being imprisoned in 2017, and she, too, is picking up the pieces now. His lieutenants left him to join the ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), his aunt, Sasikala abandoned him and their political quest before the assembly elections held this April. Dhinakaran had floated the Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) with Sasikala’s supporters after the AIADMK had expelled both. It is perhaps the only party formed to reclaim the AIADMK. The AIADMK, after stonewalling Sasikala, has been divided in their opinion of her in recent months, given that the party lost three elections since Jayalalithaa’s death--2019 parliamentary polls, 2021 assembly polls and the rural body polls in October this year. On Sunday, Sasikala distributed relief materials to those affected by the rains in Chennai and alongside her was AMMK spokesperson C R Saraswathi. “AMMK cadre are all AIADMK cadre isn’t it?” said a leader of the AMMK, who did not wish to be identified. “We aim to merge with the AIADMK, and we are working towards that.” Sasikala continues to refer to herself as the AIADMK’s general secretary and has been releasing statements on current developments such as the northeast monsoon related floods, the repeal of the farm laws. “In other districts, homes have collapsed, people are suffering, so it raises a question if the government is doing enough,” she told reporters on Sunday. “The government has to safeguard people. In Chennai, people are suffering in huts. Relief has to be provided to them immediately.” Dhinakaran’s rise In 2017, Sasikala brought back Dhinakaran into the AIADMK and elevated him as deputy general secretary after Jayalalithaa had removed him in 2010. After Sasikala took over the AIADMK as its interim general secretary, and while facing a rebellion from O Panneerselvam before she could occupy the chief minister chair, the Supreme Court convicted Sasikala in the disproportionate assets case to a four-year jail term in Bengaluru. Following that, Panneerselvam and Edappadi Palaniswami expelled both Sasikala and Dhinakaran. Dhinakaran then contested as an independent candidate from Dr Radhakrishnan (RK) Nagar assembly constituency in Chennai, which fell vacant after late J Jayalalithaa’s death in 2016. He won the RK Nagar by-poll surpassing Jayalalithaa’s margin in 2016, which shook state politics. He also created history on two accounts – being the first independent candidate to win an assembly by-poll and the election here was rescinded twice by the election commission on charges of cash being distributed to voters. Dhinakaran’s victory pushed the AIADMK to the second spot, and the DMK nominee lost his deposit. Previously, it was back in 1999 when Dhinakaran won the Periyakulam Lok Sabha constituency from the south district of Theni. Following his win in RK Nagar, Dhinakaran stood as a lone challenger to the Dravidian majors. Analysts had then said that he could even pull off a successful third front in Tamil Nadu’s politics, which has been successively ruled by the DMK and AIADMK since 1967. His cool and ever-smiling demeanour while fielding questions from the press had earned him an aura that nothing could startle him. But he could not recreate his magic. The fall In 2018, he floated the AMMK with a breakaway faction of Sasikala’s supporters, including 18 disqualified MLAs. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, AMMK did not win any seats but registered a 5% vote share, eating into the vote base of the AIADMK. In the assembly elections held in April, too, the AMMK drew a blank and registered a vote share of 2.35%. Dhinakaran was banking on Sasikala to boost his party’s prospects. His hope that her release from prison, earlier this year in January, would shake up the AIADMK did not happen. This disappointed Sasikala, too, when the AIADMK stayed tight and no senior leader, including those appointed by Sasikala when Jayalalithaa was alive, approached her. In March, Sasikala decided to step away from politics. On the day she announced her decision, Dhinkaran visited her home in Chennai and came out dejected and told the media that he could not convince her. Dhinakaran soldiered alone tying up with smaller parties such as the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI), the political wing of Popular Front of India, actor-politician Vijayakanth’s DMDK and Hyderabad-based Asaduddin Owaisi’s All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM). Dhinakaran shifted his constituency from Chennai to Kovilpatti in Thoothukudi, but he lost. However, the AMMK did play a spoiler for the AIADMK in at least 20 assembly seats where the Dhinakaran and Sasikala’s community – Mukkalathor have strong support. “Dhinakaran did not take care of RK Nagar after his victory. So people did not want to give him another chance,” said a political observer who did not wish to be named. Before the April elections, a former AIADMK MLA, SG Subramanian, among 18 disqualified legislators for supporting Dhinakaran, was re-inducted into the AIADMK. Earlier, V Senthil Balaji and Thanga Tamilselvan quit AMMK and joined the DMK. Balaji is now the electricity minister of Tamil Nadu in the ruling DMK government. However, the party has had new energy recently since Dhinakaran supported Panneerselvam’s statement that the AIADMK would discuss inducting Sasikala. AIADMK has been speaking in different voices since then, with Palaniswami saying there is no chance of having her back. AMMK also held a two-day meeting in Chennai to prepare for the ensuing urban local body polls at the start of November.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dhinakaran-banks-on-sasikala-to-regain-key-role-in-aiadmk-101637521841348.html
22-11-2021||India||24 die in November as rain fury batters Karnataka||The Karnataka government on Sunday said that at least 24 people lost their lives due to the incessant rains in the month of November. The heavy rains continue to batter down Karnataka, leaving a trail of destruction. “Bengaluru Urban, Bengaluru Rural, Tumakuru, Kolar, Chikkaballapur, Ramanagar, Hassan districts have suffered extensive damage,” said the Karnataka government. According to data by the Karnataka Disaster Management Authority (KDMA), more than 658 homes were completely destroyed and nearly 8,500 homes were partially damaged. Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai, who held a meeting with senior officials on Sunday, instructed for the immediate release of ₹1 lakh as the first installment of relief for those who lost houses. Opposition political parties have accused the Bommai government of mismanagement and prioritising elections over the calamity. Siddaramaiah, Leader of the Opposition in Karnataka, on Sunday questioned governance of Bommai-led government. “Thousands of acres of paddy, ragi, maize, vegetables, banana, [and] coconuts have been destroyed. Farmers are washing their hands with tears. Ministers are on tours and officials are warmly in their homes. People are on the streets. Is there a government here?” former chief minister Siddaramaiah said in a post on Twitter. Janta Dal (Secular) or JD (S) too criticised the Bommai government for its decision to prioritise elections when the state’s population was reeling under hardships. “There have already been unexpected rains in massive proportions. There have been mishaps, farmers have lost crops, homes and roads are damaged. We have tried to get the government’s attention towards this. “People are in pain. The government should not prioritise the election and first heed to the problems of the people which is their duty,” HD Kumaraswamy, former chief minister and JD(S) leader said on Sunday. Bommai on Sunday said he had visited affected regions in the city. “State government definitely has priority for Bengaluru. Instructions have been issued to take repair and relief works in affected areas immediately after rains subside, I will go on city rounds soon,” he said. The chief minister directed that ₹25 lakh be released for each zone in Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) limits for filing potholes. The KDMA data showed that over 3.79 lakh hectares of agricultural crops were damaged and over 30,114 hectares of horticulture crops were lost due to the incessant rains; over 2,203 kms of roads were damaged. An official statement by the chief minister’s office (CMO) said that “crops in 3.43 lakh hectares were affected due to incessant rains in August and September, affecting 1.5 lakh farmers, (and) ₹130cr has been released for them. Compensation for 79,000 farmers is pending and Chief Minister Bommai instructed for [the] release of ₹79 crore towards clearing the compensation due for them.” Karnataka received 85% more rains than the average in the months of October and November, the state disaster management authority said. In the month of November, Karnataka received 129 mm actual rains against the average of 35mm, registering an excess of 271%, data showed. Coastal Karnataka, one of the badly affected regions in the state, received 228 mm of rains as against the average of 52 mm, registering an increase of 338%. Among the districts, Chikkaballapura, about 70 kms from Bengaluru, registered 500% increase in rainfall, receiving 251 mm in November so far against the average of 42 mm. Bengaluru Urban district recorded an increase of 364%, receiving 195 mm of rainfall against the average of 42mm between November 1 and 21. Data showed that 21 districts have registered over 200% increase in rains in November. Only one district, Bidar, in the northeastern part of the State, registered a deficit of -1% of rains in November.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/24-die-in-november-as-rain-fury-batters-karnataka-101637521719956.html
22-11-2021||India||NIA to investigate arms, drugs smuggling by drones from Pakistan||New Delhi: Amid inputs of a looming threat of terror attacks in Punjab around the assembly elections, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) has been roped in to investigate a series of incidents related to smuggling of arms and ammunition, explosives as well as drugs from across the border via Punjab and Rajasthan by Lakhbir Singh Rode, one of the most wanted Khalistani militants in India and the chief of Pakistan-based International Sikh Youth Federation (ISYF), people familiar with the development said. Initial investigations have revealed that multiple consignments of small and large firearms, heroin and explosives such as RDX packed in tiffins (lunchboxes) have been sent in the past several months with the help of Pakistani spy agency ISI. Drones are primarily being used to drop these consignments with a motive to revive militancy in Punjab as well as to carry out terror attacks in other parts of the country, said a senior officer, requesting anonymity Rode, who also goes by the moniker Baba, is a nephew of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale. He is currently said to be living in Lahore, Pakistan, and works closely with one Qasim, a suspected ISI officer. Officials said the NIA is probing a case regarding the arrest of one Darvesh Singh on September 7 this year. Darvesh Singh, along with his father Anokh Singh, both residents of Ferozepur, and 5-6 others was coordinating pick-ups of arms, heroin and explosives on the Punjab and Rajasthan borders.Between August and September alone, Punjab police busted at least four modules involved in the smuggling of weapons and explosives from across the border. In fact, multiple arrests were made and several tiffin bombs, hand grenades, detonators, small pistols, etc were recovered by police in Ambala, Kapurthala, Amritsar, and Ferozepur following which the Punjab government ordered a high alert in the state. The federal anti-terror agency is already investigating a case pertaining to the recovery of a tiffin bomb in Lopoke sub-division in Amritsar on August 8. It will investigate whether there is a link between the recovery of tiffin bomb on August 8 and arrest of Darvesh Singh on September 7. Apart from the ISYF, other Khalistani outfits such as the Khalistan Zindabad Force (KZF) and the Khalistan Liberation Force (KLF) are using Chinese drones with ISI help to arm a movement to destabilise Punjab. Multiple assessments by Indian agencies and border guarding force, Border Security Force (BSF), have warned that the Pakistani army, ISI and terror groups’ use of commercial drones or quadcopters is a serious threat considering the size of the border, which is difficult to man physically round the clock.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-to-investigate-arms-drugs-smuggling-by-drones-from-pakistan-101637521481070.html
22-11-2021||India||BJP seeks JD(S) support in upcoming MLC polls||Karnataka’s ex-chief minister and senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader BS Yediyurappa on Sunday expressed confidence in Janata Dal (Secular) or JD (S) to support the saffron party in the upcoming MLC elections on December 10. “Wherever JD(S) does not have a candidate, I have confidence that they will support us and for this – I request both (HD) Deve Gowda and (HD) Kumaraswamy,” Yediyurappa said in Belagavi on Sunday. However, Kumaraswamy denied receiving any proposal. “There is no such proposal in front of me, when it does come, we will think about it,” Kumaraswamy said on Sunday. The statement fuelled speculations of the growing proximity between the BJP and the JD(S). Congress continues to attack the JD(S), terming JD(S) ‘B-Team’ of the BJP for providing tacit support to the saffron party. Defection to the BJP has been a worrying factor for the JD(S) as their presence in the old Mysuru region is being threatened due to a large number of leaders switching sides. The BJP had engineered defections in 2019 that led to the collapse of extremely turbulent 14 months of the Kumaraswamy-led JD(S)-Congress alliance that was stitched up to deny BJP a chance at forming government. The JD(S) are trying to survive the onslaught of both parties – the BJP and the Congress – by siding with the one they think is a lesser threat in the Old Mysuru region where Congress has a better foothold than the other, said people familiar with the developments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-seeks-jd-s-support-in-upcoming-mlc-polls-101637521479968.html
22-11-2021||India||ACB raids BDA offices: No question of shielding guilty, says Karnataka CM Bommai||Karnataka chief minister Basvaraj Bommai on Sunday said that anyone guilty of corruption will not be spared as allegations of corruption surfaced in the Bengaluru Development Authority (BDA), the principal planning authority of Bengaluru. “Our government will not tolerate corruption in any form. There is no question of shielding anyone found guilty,” Bommai said.Around 100 Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) officials raided the BDA offices on Friday after widespread corruption was alleged by SR Vishwanath, BDA chairman and BJP legislator from Yelahanka.“The ACB conducted a raid recently at the BDA office. We will act on the report to be submitted by the ACB. The truth will come out. There is no question of shielding anyone found to be involved in corruption,” Bommai said. He also said, “SR Vishwanath, who is the Chairman of BDA, had also drawn my attention in this regard. Urban Development Department officials have been instructed to investigate the complaints. The guilty, whoever it may be, however influential they may be, we will take action. BDA needs cleanup in the interest of delivering its services to the common man.” The BDA is one of the major departments that come under the Bengaluru district in-charge portfolio that Bommai continues to retain for avoiding the infighting within his cabinet members. Ex-CM B S Yediyurappa too had retained control over Bengaluru for the same reason, said people familiar with the developments. The corruption in the BDA comes at the time when the Bommai-led BJP government is still facing heat from the opposition on the Bitcoin scam. Congress has been relentless in its attacks on the Bommai government over the alleged laundering of money using the cryptocurrency with the help of a hacker named Srikrishna or Sriki. This is not the first time the BDA has come under the scanner. Earlier in 2010, irregular site allotments had started a series of corruption charges against Yediyurappa, which eventually led to him stepping down from the CM post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/acb-raids-bda-offices-no-question-of-shielding-guilty-says-karnataka-cm-bommai-101637521300097.html
22-11-2021||India||Karnataka: Congress slams BJP over ‘Yatra’ as state reels under rain misery||Karnataka opposition leader Siddaramaiah on Sunday said in a Twitter post that the ‘Janaswarjya Yatra’, a rally organized by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to mobilize support for the upcoming Karnataka’s legislative council polls as well as local elections, was actually the ‘Jana Barbadi Yatra’. He criticized the ruling party for prioritising politics when the entire state is reeling under heavy losses due to incessant and unseasonal rains. “Half the state has been hit by unseasonal rains. Though there has been a good crop, farmers are not able to reap the benefits. The state government is like touring talkies and performing. This is not Janaswarjya Yatra, it is the Jana Barbadi Yatra,” Siddaramaiah said in a post on Twitter. “Affected by the rains, over 20 people have died. Over 10,000 hectares of crops have been destroyed. People are on the streets as their homes have collapsed. The BJP government has to rush to their aid but instead are going around doing their drama Janaswarjya Yatra,” Siddaramaiah added. Unseasonal rains have battered several states, including Karnataka, in October and November. Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Sunday said rains have caused extensive damage. “About 3 lakh farmers were affected due to excessive rains in July, August, September months. Compensation amount had been released for them. Instructions had been issued for disbursal of ₹130 crore pending amount through Direct Benefit Transfer system,” Bommai said on Sunday. The chief minister added that district officials were instructed to submit survey reports on the losses. Bommai said the election code of conduct is also an issue that is causing delay as permission from the Election Commission is needed, adding “We will write to the Election Commission in this regard.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnatakacongress-slams-bjp-over-yatra-as-state-reels-under-rain-misery-101637521121848.html
22-11-2021||India||Andhra: Rain recedes in coastal area, but 17 still missing||Heavy rain that has wreaked havoc in the south coastal areas of Andhra Pradesh as well as the Rayalaseema region over the last few days lifted on Sunday, bringing some much-needed respite to the districts in these regions, state authorities said. An official bulletin from the state disaster management authority (SDMA) in the evening said the death toll remained at 24 but the fate of 17 people, believed to have been washed away in the floods in Kadapa, Chittoor, Anantapur and Nellore, is still not known. “There has been no trace of 11 persons, who were washed away in the floods of Cheyyeru river due to the breach of Annamayya reservoir near Pulaputhur village of Nandalur block in Kadapa district. Four teams of NDRF and three of SDRF are still on the rescue operations,” the bulletin read. Four people in Chittoor, and one each in Anantapur and Nellore, were also missing till Sunday evening. “There has been very scanty and scattered rainfall in these four districts, ranging from 0.02 mm in Chittoor to 1.7 mm in Nellore. However, there was 4 mm rainfall in Kurnool,” the SDMA bulletin said. However, the flood fury continued to ravage Kadapa, Nellore, and Chittoor districts due to heavy rain in the last three days. The bridge over Papagni river in Kamalapuram block of Kadapa district collapsed, bringing traffic to halt on this road. In Chittoor district, a high alert was sounded in several villages like Mullapudi, Padipeta, Kuntrapakam, Tanapalli, Balijepalli and Gangireddipalli, as Rayalacheruvu — a major irrigation tank of Ramachandrapuram block — is on the brink of a breach. Though the officials have been trying to plug the breach, they evacuated thousands of people from these villages to safer places. There are reports of at least three causeways on the Swarnamukhi river in Chittoor district getting washed away, cutting road links to as many as 30 villages. The officials told them that it would take at least 20 days to restore the road links. Meanwhile, in the temple town of Tirupati, several colonies are still submerged. The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) authorities, however, restored the traffic on the ghat roads to Tirumala. In the Nellore district, the Penna river has been overflowing for the last three days, inundating as many as 29 villages. Even in Nellore town, several colonies remained submerged on Sunday. The SDMA authorities said as many as 181 blocks, 1,366 villages and four towns were affected due to heavy rain in the last two days, displacing over 36,000 people. As many as 2,007 houses were damaged and 1,137 houses are still submerged. As many as 31,827 people have been shifted to 274 relief camps where they are being provided with food and water. “According to preliminary estimates, agriculture crop in 2.41 lakh hectares and horticulture crop in 1.86 lakh hectares were totally damaged,” the bulletin said. Principal secretary (revenue) Usha Rani said each affected family would be given 25 kg of rice, one kg each of red gram, onions, potatoes and palm oil free of cost. The loss of crops is being estimated and suitable compensation would be worked out, she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhrarain-recedes-in-coastal-area-but-17-still-missing-101637520819991.html
22-11-2021||India||Don’t just raise Ram slogans, follow his path too: Mohan Bhagwat||Public service is not only about raising slogans but also requires one to be conscious and work on the ground, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat said on Sunday. Speaking at an award function organised by Sant Eshwer Foundation in association with Sewa Bharti, an offshoot of the Sangh, Bhagwat said it was not enough to raise slogans in praise of Ram, but efforts must also be made to emulate him. “Nowadays, we raise the slogan of Jai Shri Ram enthusiastically. There is nothing wrong in it but we should also follow the path shown by Lord Ram,” the 71-year-old said. Bhagwat said that the Indian civilization survived many odds and continued to move forward as it believed in taking everyone along. “There a tradition from the time of Vedas that assumes entire India belongs to you. This compassion towards this land which we treat as our motherland and all those born here as our siblings…If we work with this compassion there is nothing which can stop India from growing at a desired pace,” he said. While the opponents of the RSS accuse it of fostering a communal sentiment, the RSS chief said Indian society does not oppose anyone based on their faith.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-just-raise-ram-slogans-follow-his-path-too-mohan-bhagwat-101637520760991.html
22-11-2021||India||Former Maha minister Vinod Tawde named BJP’s national general secretary||Senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and former Maharashtra minister Vinod Tawde was on Sunday appointed as the party’s national general secretary. The elevation is seen as a strong message to former chief minister and leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis and is believably done against his wish, party insiders said.Tawde (59) was appointed as the national general secretary by party’s national president JP Nadda on Sunday. The Maratha leader was appointed as secretary and made in-charge of Haryana last year, after he was almost sidelined during the state assembly polls in 2019 when he was denied party ticket. Tawde was the minister for school education, higher and technical education for five years in the Fadnavis government. The ticket was denied, according to party insiders, reportedly owing to infighting within the state unit and at the behest of Fadnavis.“Tawde, Eknath Khadse, Chandrashekhar Bawankule were a few heavyweight party leaders who were not re-nominated in the assembly polls. It was not only shocking but sent out a wrong message that the party loyalists were being ill-treated, while the outsiders were given upper hand. Similar treatment was meted out to Pankaja Munde, who had to face defeat in the polls because ‘anti-party activities’ in her constituency during the election,” said a BJP leader on condition of anonymity.“The leaders were believed to be from the anti-Fadnavis camp. Tawde was divested of the medical education department within one-and-a-half years after the Fadnavis government was formed. He was also kept away from the decision making on key issues including Maratha reservation, during the stint. Tawde’s appointment has come just a day after Bawankule was featured in the list of candidates announced for the legislative council elections to be held on December 10. This is a clear message to the Fadnavis camp,” the leader added.On Sunday, Tawde said the appointment has shown that “patience pays rich dividends in politics”.“I have been given many responsibilities by the party in the past. I was general secretary at state level, youngest chief of the Mumbai unit of the party, leader of opposition in legislative council, minister with 8 departments among other responsibilities in my political career. When I was denied ticket in 2019-Assembly polls, I had said that I am a party worker who believe in patience and there was no question of quitting party for just one denial. The patience has paid today,” Tawde said.Tawde, who was elected from Borivali constituency in 2014, is also one of the key leaders from Konkan and his elevation is seen as an attempt by the party to woo Konkani voters living in Mumbai ahead of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation elections next year. Shiv Sena enjoys larger influence on this vote bank.Former minister and BJP leader Ashish Shelar called it a happy moment for the Maharashtra unit of the party. “He (Tawde) has been a prominent leader from Maharashtra. As a secretary and in-charge of Haryana, he has done an impressive job even in the adverse atmosphere. His elevation as national general secretary is delight for all of us,” he said.Tawde began his political career as active member of ABVP and went on to become general secretary of state unit, leader of opposition in the legislative council between 2011 and 2014.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-maha-minister-vinod-tawde-named-bjp-s-national-general-secretary-101637520759904.html
22-11-2021||India||TMC leader arrested in Tripura, party plans protest in Delhi today||The Trinamool Congress will hold protests in the national capital on Monday after Tripura Police arrested their youth leader from West Bengal, Sayani Ghosh, in Agartala on Sunday for allegedly trying to disrupt chief minister Biplab Kumar Deb’s civic poll rally the day before, the party informed.A group of 15 TMC members of Parliament will be reaching Delhi on Sunday night and have a meeting with President Ram Nath Kovind on Monday over the alleged “continued” political violence in Tripura. Party supremo and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee is also expected to be in the Capital on Monday afternoon on a four-day visit, party insiders said. She had earlier said that she wanted to discuss a host of issues with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.On Monday, TMC’s youth wing leader Ghosh will be produced before a local court in Tripura. The charges against her are grave: promoting enmity, criminal conspiracy and even attempt to murder.Ghosh was booked on Saturday under sections 153 (promoting enmity between different groups), 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on the ground of religion), 506 (criminal intimidation), 307 (attempt to murder) and 120B (criminal conspiracy).“We got a complaint and accordingly summoned her. Based on the statements of the witnesses, we arrested her,” said additional superintendent of police Jagadeswar Reddy. “Four more people were with her at that time. We are trying to arrest them as well,” Reddy said without elaborating on the attempt-to-murder charge.Ghosh’s counsel, Shankar Lodh, contested this and said she was returning from a political programme in Dhalai district’s Ambassa on Saturday when her vehicle came to Ashram Chowmuhani in Agartala where a poll meeting of chief minister Deb was underway.“Someone told her ‘Khela Hobe’ and she replied to the same politically. Being a lawyer, I will not comment on political matters. But a political slogan can’t be unconstitutional. If someone threatens to kill someone, that might be considered unconstitutional,” Lodh said.TMC leader Sushmita Dev alleged that the police went to the hotel where Ghosh was staying on Saturday night and asked her to report to the police station the following morning. While she was being interrogated on Sunday, some TMC leaders who were present outside the police station were assaulted by some Bharatiya Janata Party cadres, Dev alleged.“The main motive of the BJP is to disturb TMC general secretary Abhishek Banerjee’s rally here tomorrow (Monday). We are with Sayani,” Dev told the reporters.Police said that some people were attacked by some unidentified miscreants and two were injured. “We have filed a suo motu case and will arrest them when they are identified,” Reddy said.But BJP spokesperson Nabendu Bhattacharya rubbished the allegation. “We don’t consider Trinamool Congress as our opponent and our activists didn’t attack them. They should also restrain themselves from using any such words that are not welcome,” he said.But the TMC will hold protests in the national capital on Monday while their national general secretary, Abhishek Banerjee, will lead a procession in Agartala. The party delegation in Delhi will also seek an appointment with Union home minister Amit Shah.Meanwhile, TMC started a Twitter storm on Sunday evening. “This is the HORRIFIC state of affairs in Tripura under @BjpBiplab’s Gunda Raj! While our leaders & workers are being MERCILESSLY ATTACKED every moment, @Tripura_Police continues to shield the @BJP4Tripura assailants! Urging the Hon’ble Supreme Court to take strict actions,” TMC tweeted around 8pm on Sunday.HT spoke with TMC general secretary Kunal Ghosh over the phone who was in Agartala.“Violence is going on at the Agartala women’s police station where TMC youth wing president Sayani Ghosh has been kept in custody after her arrest. Goons stormed inside the premises and attacked us in the afternoon and once again in the evening. Even a journalist was injured. We were trapped inside till a senior police officer rescued us and took us to a safe place late in the evening. Such attacks in a police station can only be seen in movies,” Ghosh said.“The BJP government in Tripura is blatantly violating the orders of the Supreme Court which said a few weeks ago that the civic elections in the state have to be fair and democratic. This is contempt of the apex court. We will raise these in Delhi,” said Kalyan Banerjee, TMC Lok Saba member.(With inputs from HTC in Kolkata)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-leader-arrested-in-tripura-party-plans-protest-in-delhi-today-101637520581153.html
22-11-2021||India||Tamil Nadu cop killed while trying to nab thieves||A 50-year-old special sub-inspector was murdered by two men in the early hours of Sunday in Tamil Nadu’s Trichy district, the police said.S Boominathan was on patrolling duty with another police beat officer, Chitravel, when he saw the duo on a motorbike with a goat. Suspecting them to be thieves, Boominathan went ahead of his colleague on a two-wheeler to intercept them. However, the suspected two thieves assaulted him with weapons and fled, the police said.A statement from the police confirmed that he was assaulted on his head with a machete. CCTV footage from the spot near Pallathupatti railways underground bridge in Keeranur shows that the special SSI bled out heavily on the road. His associate reached the spot later. “The two officers started chasing the goat thieves together, but the second officer’s bike couldn’t pick up speed, so he couldn’t follow Boominathan and went another way. By the time they spoke over the phone, and he reached the spot, the murder had occurred,” said Trichy DIG Saravana Sundar.Tamil Nadu’s additional director general of police (ADGP), Tamarai Kannan, visited the grieving family and later told reporters that they are taking rapid action in the case. “We have received a tip-off on the accused, and we will arrest them soon,” he said. Four special police teams have been formed to track down the accused. Boominathan was an SSI in the Navalpattu police station in Trichy. He was cremated with state honours and a gun salute. He is survived by his wife Kavitha, who is a homemaker, and a 21-year-old son, Kugan, who is studying an MBA course at Chennai’s Anna University. Expressing grief, chief minister M K Stalin issued a solatium of ₹1 crore to Boominathan’s family and also assured a government job for one of his family members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-cop-killed-while-trying-to-nab-thieves-101637520459910.html
22-11-2021||India||All issues have been addressed, says Sachin Pilot after Rajasthan cabinet rejig||Former Rajasthan deputy chief minister and senior Congress leader Sachin Pilot on Sunday said he is happy that all issues he had raised, including the representation of Dalits, were addressed by chief minister Ashok Gehlot in the Cabinet reshuffle.“Four Dalits have been included in the Cabinet. This is a big message. At the same time, the representation of tribals and women has been increased. This was a necessary step and the party and the government worked hard to take it forward,” Pilot told reporters at his residence here.“I am happy that the issues raised, including increasing representation of Dalits, have been addressed by the party leadership,” he added.Five of Pilot’s loyalists were among 15 ministers inducted in the rejig which was necessitated following the former deputy chief minister’s rebellion against Gehlot last year. The rebellion had prompted the Congress to form a three-member committee to look into the issues raised by Pilot.Since then, the demand for a cabinet reshuffle and equal representation of all castes and communities were raised for several months by the Pilot camp, consisting of 18 Congress MLAs, excluding the party leader.The Cabinet rejig, which took place late on Saturday, was the first in the Gehlot government, which will complete three years of its term next month. The council of ministers now has 19 cabinet ministers and 10 ministers of state, apart from the chief minister.“It has been tried that no one should be left out and the decision has been made keeping in view every section and region. The representation of Scheduled Caste and women has increased manifold in the cabinet. This in itself is very important which we all should welcome,” Pilot said.“The work has been done to give representation, participation in proper proportion to the (Dalit) section which has always stood with the Congress. For this, I thank Congress president Sonia Gandhi, (party in-charge of state) Ajay Maken, Ashok Gehlot and Govind Singh Dotasra. They discussed with all the leaders and such a big reshuffle has been done with a very comprehensive approach and after taking feedback from all the leaders and workers,” he added.The senior Congress leader also said that after the reshuffle, the state Congress was likely to be revamped to help the party take on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the 2023 assembly elections.The former deputy chief minister also denied any factionalism in the party.“There is only one faction, the faction of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, and we all are the members. It will be our endeavour to move forward collectively and win the next assembly elections,” he said.Asked what role he would assume now, Pilot said he will wait for the party to decide.Speculations are rife that the senior Congress leader would be appointed as the general secretary in-charge of an important state which will go to polls next year.“I have always worked for the party. My aim is to bring Congress back to power in 2023,” he said.Pilot also said that the panel formed last year to look into the issues raised by him had delivered results. He added that he expects that those loyal to him would find a place in political appointments, expected to start from next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/all-issues-have-been-addressed-says-sachin-pilot-after-rajasthan-cabinet-rejig-101637520399969.html
22-11-2021||India||Congress attacks Centre over Chinese ‘intrusion’ in Arunachal Pradesh||The Congress on Sunday accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government of deception and deliberate distortion over alleged Chinese intrusions in Arunachal Pradesh and questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “silence” on the issue. Sharing two satellite images of any area in Arunachal Pradesh, Congress spokesperson Dr Abhishek M Singhvi claimed that China constructed 60 structures inside the Indian territory. HT could not verify the authenticity of the two images. He also pointed out contradictions in the defence ministry and ministry of external affairs’ stance in the matter. “Chief of defence staff Bipin Rawat, at a conclave, said all is well and all constructions are happening on the Chinese side of the border. But Arindam Bagchi from the ministry of external affairs, on the same day, said illegal constructions have been done by China,” “On an issue like this, can we have this double-voiced-hypocritical-unimaginable-inexcusable divergence of views between two ministries as important and high as foreign affairs and the defence ministry?” he added. Condemning Modi’s silence on the matter, the Congress leader said: “I beseech the Prime Minister to be honest and transparent and to immediately address this very huge issue of national security.” Hitting back, BJP national spokesperson Tom Vadakkan said: “Now that the farmers’ issue is sorted out, the Congress is creating a false narrative over China’s territorial expansion. The MEA and MoD have very categorically stated that there has been no intrusion.” “These are desperate times for Congress given the elections and that’s why they are using China to reach the public, by throwing false narratives,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-attacks-centre-over-chinese-intrusion-in-arunachal-pradesh-101637520341243.html
22-11-2021||India||2021 sees 199 fatalities on Pune city roads||On November 21 or the third Sunday of November which is traditionally observed as World Remembrance Day for victims of road accidents, the traffic branch revealed that there were as many as 199 fatal accident-related deaths in 2021 as compared to 143 in 2020, and 206 in 2019. The traffic branch said that the number of fatalities had gone down only marginally despite awareness created by different wings of the state government seeking to reduce road accidents and fatalities. Traffic experts and activists said that bad roads, incomplete roads, rash driving and indiscipline were some of the main reasons behind the rise in the number of vehicular accidents in the city.Despite restrictions for almost five months and offices allowing work from home due to Covid, the fatalities this year were high. Last year the number had come down drastically with complete lockdown for over two months.DCP (traffic) Rahul Srirame said that relaxation of lockdown restrictions and the addition of two new police stations – Lonikand and Lonikalbhor – had led to the rise in number of accident-related deaths. Most of the accident-related deaths were reported on stretches of the Pune-Solapur and Pune-Ahmedabad highways that come under the city limits. “Two-wheeler riders form the major chunk of accidental deaths wherein more than 90 two-wheeler riders have died in road fatalities during the year,” Srirame told Hindustan Times.Lonikand accounted for 20 fatalities while Lonikalbhor saw 16 fatalities even as most of the city’s old areas did not witness major accidents and deaths. However, citizen-activists pointed out several roads where accidents had occurred in areas including Chandan nagar, Yerawada, Dhanori, Hadapsar, Mohammadwadi, Undri, Baner, Pashan and other areas where the traffic police was found wanting in terms of manpower, patrolling and taking strict action against rash driving.Traffic expert Prashant Inamdar said, “We need more vigilance and enforcement on the part of the traffic branch in terms of implementation of traffic rules in the city. Wider dissemination of the dangers of rash driving along with strict implementation of penalties will lead to reduction in road accidents and fatalities. It is a continuous process and long-term measures are needed so that Pune becomes safe for commuters.”November 21 – origin and significanceSince the adoption of World Remembrance Day for victims of road accidents, pursuant to the General Assembly resolution, the day is being observed by a growing number of countries around the world. According to the United Nations, the day has become an important tool in the global efforts to reduce road casualties. It offers an opportunity for drawing attention to the scale of emotional and economic devastation caused by road crashes, and for recognising the suffering of road crash victims as also the work of support and rescue services.On the occasion, a dedicated website was launched to make the day more widely known and to link countries through shared objectives and remembrance of those killed and injured in crashes.Deputy RTO Sanjay Sasane said, “On the occasion of this day, more than 40 programmes on road safety will be organised. We are working closely with different government departments, motor training schools, and our RTO office for spreading traffic safety-related awareness in the society.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2021-sees-199-fatalities-on-pune-city-roads-101637520339994.html

It is important for linking Bangladesh to north Bengal. It will provide a lot of opportunities in transportation of goods. The services will start with freight trains and, over a period of time, passenger train services will start between Siliguri and Dhaka,” Shringla added.Freight train services between Haldibari in the Alipurduar railway division and Chilahati in Bangladesh resumed on August 1, after 56 years.“The two countries have passenger train services between Kolkata and Dhaka and between Kolkata and Khulna. Passenger trains between Dhaka and Siliguri will bring in tourists and people coming for medical reasons. This is good for the region,” Shringla said.Five railway services between West Bengal and Bangladesh are currently operational. These are: Petrapole (India) - Benapole (Bangladesh), Gede-Darshan, Singhabad-Rohanpur, Radhikapur- Birol and Haldibari-Chilahati.The foreign secretary also reiterated that India has a clear laid policy in regards to China.“The Tibetan Autonomous Region is a part of that country and there is no change in our policy,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/train-services-between-siliguri-and-dhaka-to-begin-soon-shringla-101637520099946.html
22-11-2021||India||Centre’s outreach fails to make mark in Jharkhand tribal icon's village||The Union government earlier this year announced to observe the birth anniversary of Birsa Munda on November 15 as the national ‘Janjatiya Gaurav Diwas’, with this year’s celebrations including Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressing a tribal conclave in Bhopal and virtually inaugurating Birsa Memorial at the old Ranchi jail, where the tribal icon breathed his last in captivity of the British in 1900 at a young age of 25.While the legacy of Birsa Munda gained national significance this year with the Bharatiya Janata Party’s tribal outreach, his name is one of the most prominent ones in Jharkhand and is often revered with a prefix Bhagwan (God) and several important landmarks such as airport, stadiums, academic institutions, jails and roundabouts among others named after him.Jharkhand, which was carved out of Bihar on Birsa Jayanti in 2000, observes its statehood day on November 15 every year. On the day, it’s an annual ritual for politicians and bureaucrats to make a beeline to Ulihatu, the paternal village of the tribal icon located around 70 km south of state capital Ranchi, and deep inside the hilly and forested terrain under Arki block in Khunti district, which was in news for its Pathalgadi movement in 2017-18.Despite deep inside the forest, ride to Ulihatu from the Khunti district headquarters is an easy one, thanks to a high-profile visit by home minister Amit Shah in 2017 when he was the BJP national president. A 12.5-km double-lane road constructed ahead of Shah’s visit remains in good shape.On November 19, this correspondent visited Birsa Complex at Ulihatu. It was just passed the noon and a few workers were busy painting the iron grills of the huge round platform at the Birsa Complex, spread across seven acres and housing a boarding school, an upcoming hospital and a guest house.Junior engineer of the district administration, Anil Shrivastava, who was supervising the renovation work, said it was due to recent spell of rain that they were behind schedule.“Our Baba (Birsa Munda) has become the face of the state. Every year, top politicians and senior officials come here. But this is what shows the actual situation on the ground. Couldn’t this work have been started 10 days back and completed before Birsa Jayanti,” said Gangi Munda, grand daughter-in-law of Birsa Munda, pointing at the renovation work being carried by the team of the junior engineer.One of the buildings on the complex meant for the school is now home to a company of Shahastra Seema Bal (SSB) stationed permanently here as part of the state’s anti-naxal operations. Though the school, from class I to X, became operational in 2008, it only has three permanent teachers against the sanctioned strength of 18, said its principal Kartik Singh Munda, who has been posted here since 2017.“Till the first lockdown, we were given 13 extra temporary teachers who were paid on hourly basis. We have opened this month and a few students from class 6 and above have returned,” he said.The memorial, with a marble floor, has a small two-room hut. The outside wall of the hut has two marble plaques. One lists the family lineage of Birsa Munda while the second has a name of two former ministers who laid foundation stone of the memorial in 2003-04.As per the family tree, Birsa had two siblings, Konta and Kanu Munda. While Birsa was unmarried when he died, there isn’t much documentation available on Konta. Kanu’s grandson Sukhram Munda who lives just next to the memorial is the recognised living member of Birsa’s family. As a mark of honour, Sukhram and his family have been given the economic security by the state government over the past two decades.In 2007, two sons of Sukhram — Jungle Singh Munda and Kanu Munda — were inducted as peons in Khunti district administration. While the siblings live in government quarters in Khunti, their parents Sukhram and Lakhmani Devi live in the house next to the memorial. While their house still has an asbestos roof, the floor is tiled and inner courtyard covered by paver blocks. The tiles and paver blocks were laid in 2017 ahead of Shah’s visit, besides piped water connection that draws water from a solar-power tank.The renewed focus on Birsa Munda this year at the national stage brought symbolic windfall for Sukhram in an era of the growing identity politics. Sukhram, along with his sons, was flown to New Delhi the morning after Birsa Jayanti, with the trip being sponsored by the office of Union tribal affairs minister Arjun Munda, who represents Khunti Lok Sabha constituency. During his three-day trip, Sukhram was given the honour of inaugurating the Aadi Mahtosav at Dilli Haat, given a tour of the Rashtrapati Bhawan and a thorough health check-up at AIIMS.While Sukhram Munda’s family has something to count in assistance, most of the villagers in Ulihatu still live in kachha houses and dependent on rain-fed agriculture. While majority of them speak Mundari, they also show reluctance in interacting with an ‘outsider’.Shyam Singh Munda, in his early 20s, said he was “tired of speaking to press as it hardly makes any difference”, pointing at the slow pace of development of the village amidst tall promises made by successive governments.“I am seeing this since childhood. Nothing happens. People visit our village once a while but things remain as usual,” said Shyam in broken Hindi, focusing on arranging the rice straw lying on the floor.On November 15, almost the entire district machinery was at the village with the Sarkar Aapke Dwar programme. The 42-day outreach programme for service delivery at panchayat level was inaugurated by chief minister and president of Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, Hemant Soren.Deputy commissioner-cum-district magistrate of Khunti, Shashi Ranjan, said there has been a delay in providing pucca houses to the villagers. “Pucca houses in this village are being provided under Shaheed Gram Vikas Yojna and not under the PM Awas Yojna. The villagers had been demanding bigger houses. Now all formalities have been completed. Few from the village were even given certificates for their entitlements. All houses would be completed soon,” said Ranjan.As per the 2011 census, Ulihatu has 196 families with a population of 1,126, including 675 male and 451 female with an average sex ratio of 668, much lower than that of state at 948.Ranjan said they are all set to inaugurate the hospital within a fortnight, while refusing to provide details about the total cost incurred in the project. “I don’t have the figures… as funds from tourism department are also involved in it,” he added.Karia Munda, eight-time BJP MP from Khunti and one of the tallest tribal leaders in the country, expressed displeasure over the prevailing state of affairs.“It was in mid 90s when then chief minister, Lalu Prasad, made a visit to Ulihatu. Then we should to have a tribal welfare commissioner. With active support from him, I got funds worth ₹3.5 crore sanctioned for development of Birsa Munda memorial and the complex around 1996-97. But the funds were not released. After creation of Jharkhand, we got that money back and then the development work started,” said Karia Munda, sitting in his ancestral home in Angira village on the outskirts of the Khunti district headquarters.Munda underlined that none of the governments in the state, irrespective of party, gave due importance and urgency towards development of the iconic village.Sukhram, however, expressed hopes that the renewed focus on his grandfather at the national stage might bring changes in life of the tribals across the state.“The key, however, is that tribals are given good education and modern training in whichever work they do. Be it farming or poultry or any other work, they should be given proper training and exposure with the best practices in the trade,” Sukhram said on his return to Ranchi airport from New Delhi on Friday, expressing happiness about his experience of flying and the attention he received in the national Capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centres-outreach-fails-to-make-mark-in-jharkhand-tribal-icon-birsa-munda-s-village-101637520042356.html
22-11-2021||India||After acing court, Leander prepares for political battle in Goa||Indian tennis legend Leander Paes, who has recently joined the Trinamool Congress (TMC), is busy traversing through the streets of poll-bound Goa, talking to local residents about problems faced by them and promising solution while tracing his ancestral legacy in the coastal state’s political court. Taking a leaf out of his playing days, he starts early in the morning, holding meetings to plan his day, followed by making strategies for the poll campaign and review people’s response. After the meeting, the celebrity campaigner for the TMC in Goa along with his partner and Bollywood actor Kim Sharma hit the road, greeting people, posing for photographs and offering a genteel smile to those that stare from the distance. “It’s been incredible. The reception that I’m so blessed to receive was one of being a son of the soil when we went into Velim, Tolleacanto, Assolna (the village where his father Vece Paes hails from) or when we came here to Calangute to Calangute or Candolim. They all start first talking about how wonderful it was to have a son of the soil coming back to make a difference,” and Olympic bronze medalist said, while being driven from one house to another. Helping him in his first plunge in politics is a group of around 20 IPAC (Indian Political Action Committee) volunteers, who have to constantly adjust his logistics and schedule as engagements take longer than planned and meetings either get delayed or cancelled. On Sunday, Paes had to cancel a meeting with Bruno Coutinho, former India football captain in the 90s, at the last minute while trying to squeeze in a meeting with a popular local restaurateur before rushing to back-to-back meetings with party strategists later in the day.“I served the country for 30 years playing my tennis. I’ve travelled around the world and tried to bring laurels to our flag and to our people. But now that I’ve retired from tennis, my single-minded focus is to bring a better quality of life to our people and to bring a sense of peace in society and a sense of harmony,” Paes said. His plunge into politics, he said, received a “mixed reaction” even within his family. “It’s amazing how everyone has a point of view on politics. I’ve pretty much heard it all,” he added. In between getting selfies and greetings, Paes also attempts to field questions about the party’s plans for Goa, which will go to assembly polls in February-March next year. One question that he recalls being frequently asked is as a son of the soil, where was he all these years and why has he emerged in a political outfit only months before the state elections.“I think there are so many Goans and Indians who have left their roots to pursue other professions to make a living. But we never leave our roots in our hearts and minds. Could have I come ten years ago? Could I have come five years ago? Could I have come six months ago? Maybe. But the fact that I’m here now is what matters,” he said. “There is a time and a place for everything and I’ve been very blessed to be in the right place at the right time. If given the right opportunity and a platform to bring a quality of life just as my parents and forefathers have given me and my sisters, I would like to do that to all my brothers and sisters of Goa,” he added. However, there are many who remain sceptical about the promises Paes and his party are making for development of Goa.“They (TMC) are speaking the right language but are yet to grasp the intricacies of Goa’s politics and prove that they really are here with an aim to defeat the BJP. They have to choose the right candidates and support the right candidate where they can’t find the right one,” said one such person after meeting Paes. “There are several issues that affect the locals, that they don’t seem to have fully understood,” he added, requesting anonymity.“We appreciate Paes for all he has done, but politics is a different ball game. I do not think he has had much of an impact. He didn’t come to Goa even during his playing days and now suddenly before elections he is here,” said Michael Beny da Costa, a resident of Velim, where Paes’s ancestral family hails from. He was a candidate for the TMC during its earlier foray in to Goa in 2012.“It is good for the voter that he has a choice of many candidates but we are worried about a split in the secular vote,” da Costa added.Neshwin Almeida, who traces his roots to the village but now lives in Margao, said Paes’s entry will get eyeballs, but may have little impact on the party’s ultimate chances in the election.“Velim constituency comprising villages of Assolna, Ambelim, Velim, Tollecanto, Chinchinim and Sarzora is surely proud of his 1996 Olympic Bronze, but Leander never recognised his Goan ancestry in the past and preferred to be known as a Kolkata boy or Bombay lad. In fact, he is more known for his club tennis in the USA and his visits to the White House to meet Obama as Washington Kastles captain,” Almeida said. “Bringing him to Velim will cause more insecurity amongst voters that an outsider with a distant son of the soil tag is being imposed on the constituency while the local lad Antonio Clovis da Costa who joined the TMC (and is a ticket aspirant) was sidelined. Bringing sportsperson to shake hands with children, wave at fishermen and interact for two hours can’t win you polls, it’s the foot soldiers that always win polls,” he added.When asked if he was going to contest the assembly election, Paes said, “I’m growing every day and learning something new. We are assessing the situation as it is on a daily basis and if the party decides that I should contest the polls then I’m ready.”The TMC with IPAC’s assistance has decided to once again foray into the Goa political space and has brought on board former CM Luizinho Faleiro to lead the party and has even begun poaching members mainly from the Congress to boost its numbers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-acing-court-leander-prepares-for-political-battle-in-goa-101637519920025.html
22-11-2021||India||The Week Ahead: Union cabinet to meet, farm laws withdrawal on table||It just does not end when it comes to Sameer Wankhede, the controversial western zone chief of the Narcotics Control Bureau. This week, the Bombay high court will hear a petition regarding a caste certificate. A petition was filed in the Bombay high court seeking directions to the caste scrutiny committee to verify Wankhede’s caste certificate. It also asks the Union Public Services Commission (UPSC) to terminate his services if the scrutiny committee finds that he has misused his father’s scheduled caste (SC) certificate. The petition claims that the SC status was relinquished after Dnyandev Wankhede, Sameer’s father, got married to a Muslim woman. In essence, the petition states that Wankhede entered the civil service by hiding the fact that he was a Muslim and by misrepresenting his caste/religion. Perhaps the biggest story this week will be the Union cabinet meeting on Wednesday when it is likely to discuss the repealing of the three controversial farm laws that Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced last week in a nationally televised speech. On Monday, farmers will gather for the mahapanchayat called by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha, a coalition of more than 40 organisations from across the country, ahead of the cabinet meeting. Farmers are demanding the formal decision to repeal should come early and that should be accompanied by a new minimum support price regulation. In Kerala, a local court in the state capital Thiruvananathapuram will start hearing on Monday a charge sheet filed against education minister V Sivankuty and five former legislators in a case related to destroying assembly property in a fracas in 2016. All courts, including the Supreme Court, had dismissed their pleas to discharge the accused. The child welfare commission is expected to take a final decision on former SFI leader Anupma S Chandran’s plea by Wednesday. Hectic political activity is likely to be witnessed this week in Rajasthan after a new cabinet was sworn in on Sunday under chief minister Ashok Gehlot. The CM on Monday is likely to allot departments to ministers, appoint parliamentary secretaries and advisors. The process to make political appointments in corporations and commissions will also begin this week. Assam will embark on a door-to-door campaign to ensure 100% coverage of the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine among all eligible beneficiaries. The campaign will continue till November 27. In Karnataka, political parties will switch gear ahead of the MLC polls as the deadline for nominations ends on Tuesday. Next week will see the Karnataka government publish an estimate on loss to crops and infrastructure due to rains since November 11. Karnataka high court is also expected to take up a case against a ban on gambling. In West Bengal, the schedule of the upcoming civic body polls in Kolkata and Howrah will be decided this week. The government wanted to hold the polls on December 19, but the BJP moved the Calcutta high court demanding simultaneous polls in all 120-odd civic bodies across Bengal. The hearing is on November 24. Meanwhile, in Tamil Nadu, restoration of damaged roads and other infrastructure touch points will begin this week after torrential rain disrupted life last week. A Central team of six members is likely to visit the state to assess the damage and provide aid for restoration work. BJP national general secretary (organisation) BL Santosh will reach Dehradun, Uttarakhand’s capital, on a three day visit from November 24 during which he will hold meetings ahead of the upcoming polls. West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee is scheduled to visit Delhi on Monday and is likely to meet PM Narendra Modi. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal will visit Punjab for what he termed as the ‘Mission Punjab’ tour. Also, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman will visit Jammu & Kashmir on Tuesday, while BJP chief JP Nadda will launch the party’s Uttar Pradesh poll campaign from Kanpur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-week-ahead-union-cabinet-to-meet-farm-laws-withdrawal-on-table-101637519742789.html
22-11-2021||India||Singapore, India to resume flights under Vaccinated Travel Lane from Nov 29||Singapore said on Sunday it has reached an agreement with India on resuming commercial flights under the Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) facility that will commence with six daily flights from Chennai, Delhi and Mumbai on November 29.The city state began discussions with Indian authorities last week for a temporary arrangement for partial resumption of commercial flights between the two sides following the launch of VTL for quarantine-free travel for fully vaccinated travellers.Singapore high commissioner Simon Wong tweeted that joint efforts by the lead agencies of both sides resulted in the resumption of commercial flights. Travellers from India can apply for a Vaccinated Travel Pass (VTP) from November 22, he said.VTL travellers must be fully vaccinated and present a digital proof of vaccination. They must also take two Covid-19 tests – a pre-departure test within two days before departing for Singapore, and an on-arrival test at Changi airport, following which they have to remain self-isolated until the result is confirmed to be negative.External affairs minister S Jaishankar, who was in Singapore last week, tweeted on November 17 that he had discussed enhancing travel arrangements between the two countries at a meeting with Singapore’s transport minister S Iswaran.The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) said in a statement it “reached an agreement with the Ministry of Civil Aviation of India on the resumption of scheduled commercial passenger flights”.“This will facilitate quarantine-free travel on the Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) from India to Singapore, which will start from 29 November 2021 with six designated VTL flights daily from Chennai, Delhi and Mumbai,” it said.Airlines can also operate non-VTL flights between India and Singapore, and travellers on these flights will be subject to certain public health requirements, including a Covid-19 test two days before departure and serving a seven-day “Stay-Home Notice (SHN)” at the place of residence, a hotel or a serviced apartment.The airlines will announce the schedules for VTL and non-VTL flights when ready.People familiar with developments said the arrangement with Singapore will be on the lines of an air bubble. India currently has air bubble arrangements with 30 countries.According to the CAAS statement, short-term visitors and long-term pass holders will need to apply for a VTP to enter Singapore under the VTL. Applications for VTP for both categories of visitors from India, Malaysia, Indonesia, Finland and Sweden will open on November 22.“CAAS understands that travellers are looking forward to the launch of the VTL and would like to assure travellers that there is no need to rush to apply for the VTP,” the statement said.VTPs will initially be issued to those who intend to travel to Singapore from November 29, 2021 to January 21, 2022. Those who intend to enter Singapore after December 1 were encouraged to apply after November 24.Short-term visitors were advised to obtain a visa after receiving VTP approval. They must also purchase travel insurance, with a minimum coverage of $30,000 for Covid-19-related medical treatment and hospitalisation costs. In Singapore, these visitors must also use the TraceTogether app to facilitate contact tracing.Currently, the only flights from Singapore allowed to carry passengers to India are those under the Vande Bharat Mission (VBM). Since these are chartered repatriation flights, they could not be designated as VTL flights.Singapore started the VTL mechanism on September 8 with two countries – Brunei and Germany. It now has VTL arrangements with 13 countries, including Australia, the UK and the US. VTLs for India, Finland, Indonesia, Malaysia and Sweden will become operational from November 29, and similar arrangements for Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) will begin from December 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/singapore-india-to-resume-daily-flights-under-vaccinated-travel-lane-from-nov-29-101637519741816.html
22-11-2021||India||Centre may bring back three farm laws after 2022 assembly polls, fears Samajwadi Party||The Samajwadi Party (SP) on Sunday expressed apprehension that the Centre could bring back the three contentious farm laws after the assembly polls in five states, including Uttar Pradesh, next year as it cited the statements made by Rajasthan Governor Kalraj Mishra and BJP MP from Unnao Sakshi Maharaj on them. On Friday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the Centre will repeal the three farm laws after nearly a year-long agitation by a section of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, opposing the laws. Both Mishra and Maharaj told reporters on Saturday that the laws can be brought back again, if needed.In a tweet in Hindi, the Samajwadi Party charged, “It is absolutely clear that their (BJP) heart is not clean and after the elections, the bills will be brought in again. Occupying Constitutional posts, Governor of Rajasthan Kalraj Mishra and BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj have said that the BJP government may bring a bill for farm laws...This is the truth of those tendering false apologies to farmers...The farmers will bring a change in 2022.”Mishra on Saturday said in Bhadohi that efforts were made to make the farmers understand the provisions of the farm laws, and positive aspects, but the farmers had been demanding the withdrawal of the three farm laws and were protesting against them. Eventually, the government felt that the laws should be withdrawn, and if there was a need to make the laws again, it would be done. “The farmers were continuously demanding that the farm laws be withdrawn and it was done in a very civilised manner. It is a good step and an appropriate decision,” Mishra said.Speaking to reporters in Unnao on Saturday, BJP’s Sakshi Maharaj said, “Bills are made and repealed. They will come again, and will be made again. It hardly takes any time (Bills to bante rehte hai, bigarte rehte hai...vaapas aajaayenge, dobara ban jaayenge...koi der nahi lagti hai). But I thank Modiji that he displayed a big heart and he chose the nation over the laws. And those whose intentions were wrong, those who had raised slogans of ‘Pakistan Zindabad’ and ‘Khalistan Zindabad’, have got a befitting reply.”He also categorically stated that there was no connection between the announcement of repealing of the farm laws with next year’s Uttar Pradesh assembly elections. “In the UP 2022 assembly elections, the BJP will cross the 300-mark in the (403-member) UP Legislative Assembly. In India, there is no substitute for (Prime Minister) Modi and (UP chief minister) Yogi Adityanath. Their magic will stay,” he said.SP national president Akhilesh Yadav in a press conference on October 25 (much before the PM’s announcement) had said, “It is quite possible that the BJP government (at the Centre) will withdraw the ‘black’ farm bills and then reintroduce them after the elections.” And in a press conference on Friday, hours after the PM’s announcement, Akhilesh Yadav had said: “Saaf nahin hai inka dil, chunayo ke baad fir layengey Bill (Their heart is not clean; they will reintroduce the bill after the elections).

22-11-2021||India||Uttarakhand elections: Free pilgrimage service for senior citizens if AAP voted to power, says Kejriwal||Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday promised to introduce a free pilgrimage service for senior citizens in Uttarakhand if the party was voted to power in the assembly elections next year.Under the scheme, Hindus will be taken to Ayodhya, Muslims to Ajmer Sharif and Sikhs to Kartarpur Sahib, Kejriwal told reporters during his one-day visit to Haridwar.“The AAP government in Uttarakhand will provide senior citizens free pilgrimage facilities to Ramjanmabhoomi in Ayodhya for Hindus, Ajmer Sharif for Muslims and Kartarpur Sahib pilgrimage for Sikhs residing in the state,” he said.Uttarakhand is already a religious hub and our party will make it a spiritual capital of the country, he added. Referring to a similar scheme introduced by his government in Delhi, Kejriwal said: “We introduced a free pilgrimage scheme for the elderly in Delhi under which they are taken in the comfort of AC trains for free to 12 pilgrimage destinations all over the country, including Haridwar, Rishikesh, Vaishno Devi and Puri.”At least 36,000 people have already availed the scheme under which people are selected every year for pilgrimages, he added. Besides this, the AAP chief also promised a monthly stipend of ₹5,000 to the unemployed, 80% reservation in jobs for local residents and one lakh jobs within six months of the party coming to power. “To check hill migration, a separate migration department will be formed in Uttarakhand,” he said. Kejriwal assured the people of Uttarakhand a huge positive change in development works, time-bound completion of projects and corruption-free governance which the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress, he alleged, only promise prior to the polls but fail to fulfill them after forming a government.Claiming that his party changed Delhi when people gave it a chance, Kejriwal asked for just one opportunity for the AAP to serve Uttarakhand.“We changed Delhi thoroughly when we were given a chance. Give us just one opportunity in Uttarakhand. You will forget about all political parties,” he said.Kejriwal also held a meeting with autorickshaw drivers in Haridwar and promised to address their problems as he had done in Delhi, if the AAP forms the government in the state. The auto-rickshaw drivers of Delhi are admirers of the AAP and played a vital role in its victory, he said.Several local residents and party workers took part in the AAP chief’s roadshow which began from Parshu Ram and ended at the Shankar Ashram intersection. Hitting out at the AAP chief over his poll announcements, BJP district general secretary Vikas Tiwari said: “They don’t have party cadre in all the 13 districts but making unrealistic claims of contesting in all 70 segments. Will the Delhi chief minister and his deputy (Manish Sisodia) be their faces or crowd pullers in Uttarakhand too?”“It is BJP which will win 60 plus seats, even Congress is nowhere near, forget the AAP,” he added. Congress national general secretary Harish Rawat said Kejriwal should first fulfil similar promises he had made to the people of Delhi. This is Kejriwal’s third visit to the hill state this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-elections-free-pilgrimage-service-for-senior-citizens-if-aap-voted-to-power-says-kejriwal-101637519679947.html
22-11-2021||India||PM Modi pitches for high-power technology for grassroot policing||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday appreciated the positive change in police attitude towards the public, particularly post Covid, at a conference of director generals of police (DGP) and inspector generals of police (IGP) in Lucknow, officials said.The Prime Minister also pitched for setting up of a high-power police technology mission, under the leadership of the Union home minister Amit Shah, to adopt future technologies for grassroot policing requirements.Modi was addressing the valedictory session of the three-day conference at the UP Police headquarters here when he made the suggestions, an official statement said. The event was inaugurated by Shah on Friday. “Took part in the DGP/IGP conference in Lucknow. This is an important forum in which we are having extensive deliberations on modernisation of our police set-up,” Modi tweeted. At the event, Modi sought an analysis of all police-related incidents and developing case studies to make it an institutionalised learning mechanism. He further hailed the hybrid format of the conference as it allowed a free flow of information between various ranks, the statement said. It added that Modi suggested involving highly qualified youth to look for technological solutions, through hackathon, to tackle some of the routine challenges faced by the police.The Prime Minister suggested the development of inter-operable technologies which would benefit police forces across the country. Citing the importance of technology in the lives of the general public, Modi gave examples of CoWIN, the online platform for Covid-19 vaccination, the GeM, the government e-market place and UPI, the instant real-time payment system. He also suggested a positive use of drone technology for the benefit of the people and stressed on a review of the SMART policing concept introduced in 2014. He suggested the development of a roadmap for its continuous transformation and institutionalisation of the same concept in police forces, the statement said. Violence perpetrated by Maoists, action against terror modules and cyber crime were some of the issues that figured prominently for discussion at the event.The Prime Minister sat through the deliberations in the entire session on Saturday. The conference was attended by 62 DGPs/IGPs of states/Union territories and DGs of CAPFs (central armed police forces)/central police organisations (CPOs). Over 400 officers of various ranks attended the conference virtually from Intelligence Bureau (IB) offices across the country. The Prime Minister also awarded the President’s Police Medal for distinguished service to IB personnel.In the run-up to the conference, various core groups of DGPs were formed for holding discussions on key aspects of national security such as prison reforms, terrorism, left-wing extremism, cyber-crimes, narcotics trafficking, foreign funding of NGOs, drone-related matters and development of border villages.For the first time, as per the directives of the Prime Minister, Indian Police Service (IPS) officers from various states submitted articles on contemporary security issues, which added more value to the conference.On Friday, Shah awarded trophies to three best police stations of the country. He also participated in all the discussions and offered his suggestions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-pitches-for-high-power-technology-for-grassroot-policing-101637519559821.html

The process is currently on with the health and ministry of external affairs and other departments working closely to make it happen. It is just a matter of time before the approval is granted,” added the official.Covax facility was created in 2020, to ensure global equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines, and is led by Gavi, the vaccine alliance, the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations (CEPI), and WHO (World Health Organisation).Covax facility has two categories — one is self-financing countries and second is those needing support. Rich countries that are part of the Covax facility are paying for their vaccines and also support 92 countries that require support.India also contributes to Covax facility because the country’s vaccine manufacturing base is solid and very appropriate for use in lower- and middle-income countries. It suits the settings of these countries in terms of cold chain management, training of workers etc., and the vaccines developed and manufactured in the country are also cost-effective, easy to use and easy to administer.India halted export of Covid-19 vaccines in April this year, after a severe second wave hit the country because of which the government of India decided to open up vaccination for all adults.After almost 70% of the country’s population received at least first dose and about 30% were fully vaccinated, the government decided to resume exports. Last month, 4 million doses were approved for exports to four countries — Iran, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Myanmar — as part of the Modi government’ vaccine maître initiative, and Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) has also been given approval this month to export 20 million doses of its second Covid-19 vaccine, Covovax, to Indonesia.Government is making efforts through a special drive — Har Ghar Dastak (knock on every door) — to ensure no eligible person is left without taking the vaccine shot.“The supply chain has improved tremendously, and we have enough to vaccinate the remaining population; therefore, the surplus amount can be shipped to other countries that are in need of the vaccines,” said a top government functionary, on condition of anonymity.On Sunday, at least 200 million balanced and unutilised vaccine doses were lying with all states and Union territories.Experts also said that vaccine supply seems no longer an issue in the country, and efforts of the authorities concerned must now be concentrated towards covering the last mile efficiently as those who were willing to get vaccinated have already received the shot.“In past couple of months, we have seen that there is no shortage of Covid vaccines doses; so, the focus now should be on identifying and reaching out to those who are vaccine hesitant. Instead of waiting for these people to reach vaccination centres, it was a good idea to go door-to-door,” said Giridhara Babu, head, epidemiology, Indian Institute of Public Health.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/negotiations-over-release-of-vaccine-for-covax-in-final-stage-101637519439873.html

Patiala is with us for 400 years,” a post on his official Facebook page said, quoting him. The two-time former chief minister quit the Congress earlier this month and floated his outfit, the Punjab Lok Congress.Punjab will pick a new assembly in elections early next year.“I am not going to leave it (Patiala) due to Sidhu,” the Facebook post said, in a reference to his spat with Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu. The veteran leader, in April, challenged Sidhu to contest against him from the seat months before the feud between the two leaders snowballed into a crisis in the party’s state unit and led to the unceremonious exit of Singh as chief minister.The Patiala assembly constituency has been a stronghold of Singh’s family. He has won the seat four times in the past, while his wife, Preneet Kaur, represented it between 2014 and 2017. Singh’s father, Yadavinder Singh, was the last ruler of the princely state of Patiala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amarinder-says-he-will-not-leave-patiala-seat-101637518600287.html
22-11-2021||India||New Raj cabinet takes oath, Pilot camp gains||Rajasthan governor Kalraj Mishra administered on Sunday the oath of office to 15 lawmakers as ministers in the Ashok Gehlot-led state government, the first major overhaul of the cabinet, a month before the Congress completes three years in office.Of the 15 MLAs administered oath, 12 are were not in the council that resigned on Friday and three have been elevated to cabinet rank. The 15 include five lawmakers considered close to former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot, who rebelled against CM Gehlot in July 2020 before an uneasy truce came into effect.All 20 ministers in the Gehlot cabinet tendered resignations on Saturday to pave way for the reshuffle. On Sunday, only three were dropped as they were not eligible for cabinet positions. Education minister Govind Singh Dotasra is state party chief; health minister Raghu Sharma and revenue minister Harish Chaudhary were made state in-charges for Gujarat and Punjab, respectively.Of the remaining 17 ministers, three were elevated to Cabinet rank and 14 were retained. With the induction, the Cabinet has reached its maximum strength of 30 for a 200-member state assembly. Among the inductees were five Pilot loyalists including -- Vishwendra Singh and Ramesh Meena --- who were sacked from the cabinet after Pilot’s rebellion last year. Other Pilot loyalists inducted are Murari Meena, Brajendra Ola and Hemaram Choudhary.Mamta Bhupesh, Bhajan Lal Jatav and Tika Ram Julee were promoted to cabinet rank. Four new MLAs were inducted as ministers of state including BSP leader-turned-Congress MLA Rajendra Gudha, who is considered close to CM Gehlot. Other ministers of state were – Zahida Khan, Brajendra Ola and Murari Lal Meena.Of the 30 ministers, nine are from reserved SC/ST category and there are ministers from all prominent communities such as Gujjars, Jats and Rajputs. However, there are 12 districts without a minister while 14 out of 30 ministers are from four districts – Jaipur, Bharatpur, Dausa and Bikaner.None of the independents supporting the government have found a place in the cabinet.Congress leaders, wary of unease within the state unit, said the chief minister will appoint 15 MLAs as parliamentary secretaries and another seven as his advisers in the coming weeks. Some others could be appointed as head of commissions and boards, people aware of the matter said. “Everyone would get some important position in the government or the party,” a senior Congress leader said, after the oath taking ceremony, asking not to be named.Before the oath taking ceremony, Gehlot addressed MLAs at state party office and said those who could not become ministers have no less roles. All India Congress Committee chief Sonia Gandhi said that those who keep patience get rewarded one day, one of the leaders aware of the meeting said.The CM said ministers should meet people every day and that they have responsibilities towards the entire state and not just towards their constituencies.Congratulating the new ministers, Gehlot tweeted: “Best wishes to all the MLAs who took oath as ministers of Rajasthan government today. In the last 35 months, our government has done the work of giving sensitive, transparent and accountable good governance to the state. Despite all the adverse circumstances, our government have taken the state forward on the path of development.”Pilot expressed satisfaction over the new face of the council of ministers and said the rejig was after much brainstorming and discussions. “I am happy that the issues raised including increasing representation of Dalits have been addressed by the party leadership,” said Pilot.“It has been tried that no one should be left out and the decision has been made keeping in view every section and regional point of view. The representation of SCs, women has increased manifold. This in itself is very important which we all should welcome,” he said.The clamour for Cabinet reshuffle was growing for the last several months with the Pilot camp demanding they be accommodated.Political analyst Manish Godha said the reshuffle is a balancing act to settle the conflict within the state Congress. The party has come up with a formula in which the dissident faction got five and Gehlot’s got ten berths. The party high command has maintained the supremacy of the CM but Gehlot failed to get some independent MLAs inducted. For Pilot’s camp, the return of two leaders – Ramesh Meena and Vishwendar Singh -- is a key win.“Overall it is a good act of balancing ahead of the assembly polls in 2023,” said Godha.Congress has 108 MLAs in the 200-member assembly. It also has the support of 12 out of 13 independent MLAs.Bharatiya Janata Party MLA Ram Lal Sharma said Congress leaders making statements of unity was just a front and there were many developments behind closed doors. He said the party will face resentment from senior MLAs, who are sidelined and not inducted in the cabinet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-raj-cabinet-takes-oath-pilot-camp-gains-101637518539027.html
22-11-2021||India||Worker’s hand chopped off for demanding wages in MP||Three men have been arrested for allegedly chopping off the hand of a 45-year-old Dalit man in Madhya Pradesh’s Rewa district after he asked his employer to pay his pending wages, police said on Sunday.The victim, Ashok Saket, is undergoing treatment at the Sanjay Gandhi Medical College in the district, the officials said.The incident occurred at Dolmau village under the Sirmaur police station, about 40 km away from the Rewa district headquarters, on Saturday, when Saket went to his employer, Ganesh Mishra, to ask for his wages, officials said.An argument broke out between the two, following which Mishra severed Saket’s hand, Rewa superintendent of police Navneet Bhasin said.“Ashok Saket used to work as a labourer at a construction site of Ganesh Mishra. Mishra was not paying his wages. On Saturday, Saket went to collect his wages but they had a heated argument. Mishra chopped off one of his hands,” Bhasin said.The incident came to light when Saket approached the Sirmour police station, Bhasin said. “Saket reached Sirmour police station and informed police about the incident. Police admitted him to a hospital.”“A police team reached the spot and recovered a hand after two hours. A team of doctors performed surgery but could not reattach it,” Bhasin said. Saket is reported to be in a stable condition.Mishra has been arrested along with his brothers Ratnesh and Krishna Mishra, and booked under section 307 (attempt to murder) of IPc and under relevant section of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, Bhasin said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/workers-hand-chopped-off-for-demanding-wages-in-mp-101637518479014.html
22-11-2021||India||Five charts that explain the inflation situation in India||How serious is the inflation problem in India? The answer depends on which indicator one is looking at. Retail inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) grew at 4.5% on a year-on-year basis in October. The Wholesale Price Index (WPI), on the other hand, grew at 12.5% in this month. What is one to make of these divergent estimates of inflation in India? Here are five charts which put this in perspective.CPI has been higher in the past, but WPI is at an all-time highAs far as retail inflation goes, India has seen worse even in the current CPI series which starts from January 2011. However, WPI has been in its highest ever territory in the past few months; it had never breached the double-digit barrier until April 2021.But CPI and WPI measure different set of pricesLest one assumes that the difference between CPI and WPI is the former measuring retail and the latter wholesale prices, it is important to clarify that the CPI and WPI commodity baskets differ significantly. The difference is on two counts: weight of different commodities in the two indices and the kind of commodities which are included in each basket. For example, food items have a share of 39% in the CPI basket. For food and beverages combined, this share is 46%. In contrast, food items account for just 24% of the WPI basket. Price of housing, which accounts for 22% of the CPI basket, is not present in WPI at all. Then there are items such as fertilisers and synthetic rubber in the WPI, which are not present in the CPI. This difference is on account of the purposes of the two indices. CPI seeks to measure the price change facing a household’s budget; WPI is the best proxy for producer prices in India.There is more to inflation than fuel pricesHeadline inflation numbers would have been higher had it not been the recent moderation in food prices. And, fuel prices have been an important source of tailwinds for both retail and wholesale inflation. The fuel sub-category of both CPI and WPI is at an all-time high at the moment. However, fuel is not the only source of inflation at the moment. Prices of non-food non-fuel goods and services have also been rising at a fast pace. Trends in the CPI sub-categories of clothing and footwear and miscellaneous (it mostly includes consumer services) and WPI sub-category of manufacturing goods clearly shows that inflation is pretty broad based in nature at the moment.Is it a case of imported inflation?International prices have definitely played a role. And it is not just an increase in crude oil prices. The Bloomberg Commodity Index – it is a weighted average of prices of energy, grains, industrial and precious metals, cotton and livestock – has increased significantly in the post-pandemic period. To be sure, it is still way below its all-time high and the trend has flattened in the past few weeks. Some independent economists have been arguing that the post-pandemic surge in international commodity prices – it was the result of twin shocks of disrupted value chains and sudden spike in pent-up demand – might have peaked already. If this is indeed the case, price pressures should ease going forward.But there is also a profiteering angle to current inflation storyWhether or not, and to what extent producers raise prices for consumers is among the most important bargains in economies. Producers are more confident of raising prices when they expect demand to be price inelastic i.e. less sensitive to change in prices. This is likely to be the case when consumer incomes are robust (higher prices do not hurt) or when producers do not fear being outcompeted by someone offering lower prices. Economic inequality, both among producers and consumers, plays an important role in this bargain.In a research note dated August 2, Pranjul Bhandari, Chief India economist at HSBC had underlined this possibility. “A key structural shift over the last year has been the rise in inequality. At the firm level, there is evidence that the pricing power of large firms has risen over the last year. At the individual level, higher demand for services could distort prices. The rich tend to consume more services than the poor, and the disproportionate rise in demand could stoke services inflation (which can’t be traded away like goods)”, the note said. In her note after the latest CPI numbers were released, Bhandari has reiterated this argument. “This component (core inflation or non-food non-fuel component of CPI basket) is most at risk over the foreseeable future as producers start to pass on higher input costs to consumers and services demand rises as vaccination rates pick up”, the note said.An HT analysis of data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy’s Prowess database – it is among the most comprehensive corporate database in India – supports Bhandari’s argument. The ratio of corporate profits to raw material costs – other things remaining the same, it would tell us whether firms are passing a greater or smaller share of input costs to consumers – has increased significantly in the post-pandemic period.It might be tempting to call for anti-profiteering actions to control such tailwinds to inflation. However, this is an option where a policy intervention carries a big risk of subverting market signals in the name of correcting them. A better way to look at this problem is to ask what has led to the rise in economic power of large corporations or the formal sector which has bestowed it with asymmetric pricing power in the economy. The answer to this question must confront the larger realm of political economy rather than tracking the intersection of demand and supply of individual commodities.(Vineet Sachdev contributed to this story for analysis of the CMIE Prowess data)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/five-charts-that-explain-the-inflation-situation-in-india-101637513078703.html
22-11-2021||India||‘Irresponsible nations twisting definitions of sea laws’: Rajnath Singh||In a veiled jibe at China, Union defence minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday said “some irresponsible nations” for the sake of their narrow partisan interests and hegemonic tendencies are coming up with inappropriate interpretations of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).It is a matter of concern that UNCLOS is being repeatedly weakened by arbitrary interpretation of its definition by some nations, he added.The minister was speaking after commissioning of Indian Navy’s destroyer INS Visakhapatnam in Mumbai when he made the remarks.“There are some nations - I would like to say irresponsible nations – (who) for the sake of their narrow partisan interests, keep on giving new and inappropriate interpretations to these international laws from hegemonic tendencies,” he said, without naming China.“The arbitrary interpretations create obstacles in the path of a rule-based maritime order,” he added.China has been militarising islands in South China, a move that has attracted global criticism. The area has overlapping claims of several East and Southeast Asian nations.“India is a responsible maritime nation and we believe in rule-based navigation and friendly and peaceful relations with all nations,” Singh said, adding that India envisions a rule-based Indo-Pacific, with freedom of navigation, free trade and universal values, in which the interests of all the participating countries are protected.Prime minister Narendra Modi’s SAGAR (security and growth for all) embodies the same values and principles, the defence minister said.Besides border disputes, Singh said maritime matters have been leading nations to bolster their militaries. “Make India an indigenous ship-building hub for not only our country but also the world,” he said.INS Visakhapatnam, which is the first of the four stealth guided-missile destroyers under project-15B, was commissioned in the Indian Navy at the naval dockyard here. Project 15B comprises four ships — Visakhapatnam, Mormugao, Imphal and Porbandar, and all are being built by the Mazgon Dock Limited (MDL).The ship is also packed with sophisticated state-of-the-art weapons and sensors such as surface-to-surface missile and surface-to-air missiles. It is fitted with a modern surveillance radar which provides target data to the gunnery weapon systems of the ship. The anti-submarine warfare capabilities are provided by the indigenously developed rocket launchers, torpedo launchers and Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) helicopters.“INS Visakhapatnam commissioning marks a milestone in indigenous shipbuilding, capability, firepower and intent in securing the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). Indian Navy is the primary manifestation of India’s maritime power,” Navy chief admiral Karambir Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/first-of-four-stealth-guided-destroyer-ins-visakhapatnam-commissioned-in-indian-navy-101637488837757.html
22-11-2021||India||Army, navy and IAF get 6 months to respond to theatre command final proposal||The department of military affairs (DMA) has given the Indian Army, Indian Navy and the Indian Air Force service headquarters six months till mid-2022 to respond to its final military theatre commands proposal before commencing the raising of much required rationalised structures for countering adversaries. China has already integrated theatre commands with mixed element brigades and is now helping Pakistan to also reform its warfighting systems with theatre commands.According to officials in the know of the developments, the DMA under Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat has sent the final structure to the three-service headquarters for giving their considered view in writing to the defence ministry in the next 180 days. It is understood that once the army, navy and the air force come back to DMA with their suggestions or objections before the process of raising theatre commands begins with senior military commanders indicating that the new commands will be functioning by end-2022.While the army and the navy are all for theatre commands, the air force is trying to reconcile with the division of its air assets among respective theatre commands. Fuelling discontent and new hurdles against the theatre commands is the fact that the service chiefs will no longer be numero uno of the respective military branches but will only be responsible for training and prioritisation of hardware purchases as part of the committee headed by the permanent chief of staff or the CDS in this case. It is this resistance to change or reform by the three services and the pressure from the retired ex-servicemen lobby that has led to the defence ministry consulting all and sundry for military theatre commands.Fact is that while the entire 3488 of Line of Actual Control is handled by the Western Theatre Command of the PLA including elements of the air force, armour, artillery and rocket regiments, it is faced with three—northern, central and eastern command—of the Indian Army along with similar three commands of the Indian Air Force. While the PLA theatre commander directly reports to the Central Military Commission (CMC) under President Xi Jinping, the Indian Army and Indian Air Force report to their respective chiefs like in World War II and who in turn report to the defence minister with a dotted line to the Prime Minister of India.Even the Indian Navy is divided into western and eastern commands, whose commanders report to Chief of Naval Staff, while the Andamans and Nicobar Commander, the key to any sea battle in future, reports to the Chief of Integrated Defence Staff or CISC. Simply put, all the services operate within their own silos and rarely are on the same wavelength on crucial issues facing the security of the nation. But for record’s sake, all the services have been talking about joint manship or battle synergy since the 1999 Kargil war.While India, often described as raucous and chaotic democracy, takes its own time to reform and rationalise the Indian military amidst continuous state, by-elections, and general elections, it is faced with as authoritarian Communist China ruled by a dictator for life and a quasi-democracy in Pakistan where the army is forever in power and rules the roost. Indian military must reform or else it will be surprised again by the PLA like it was in May 2020 on the banks of the Pangong Tso.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-navy-and-iaf-get-6-months-to-respond-to-theatre-command-final-proposal-101637481379968.html
