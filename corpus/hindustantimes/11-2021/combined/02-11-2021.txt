The CM said this step had been taken to safeguard the interest of consumers of the state, to reduce the burden of costly power. The average per unit charges (fixed and variable) remained at ₹5.1, ₹5.55 and ₹5.3 during financial years (FY) 18-19; FY 19-20 and FY 20-21, respectively, whereas the average cost of power per unit in the short-term market for these years has been ₹3.86, ₹3.21 and ₹3.01, respectively, a spokesperson of CMO said. On account of the cost differential between TSPL power and the short-term market power at ₹2 per unit, as per prevailing trends and the units scheduled from TSPL as 9,000 MUs, the additional cost being incurred by the PSPCL per annum, at the present rates, was about ₹1,800 crore, the CMO said, pegging the liability for the remaining period of the PPA at ₹36,000 crore. “Due to its higher variable rates, TSPL is placed lower down the merit order and as a result, lower quantum of power is scheduled, whereas PSPCL has to pay full capacity charges for the declared availability of the plant,” the CMO added. Since FY 2014-15 to FY 2020-21, 24,176 MUs of energy has been surrendered, while fixed charges of about ₹2,920 crore have been paid by the PSPCL for such energy. The cost of surrendered power from this plant was ₹389 crore, ₹756 crore and ₹446 crore during FY 18-19, FY 19-20 and FY 20-21, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punjab-cm-gives-nod-to-send-ppa-repudiation-notice-to-tspl-101635877790576.html

02-11-2021||Chandigarh||GADVASU experts issue advisory to keep dogs safe during Diwali||Ahead of Diwali, experts at Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (GADVASU) have issued an advisory asking dog owners to keep their pets safe during the festival amid bursting of crackers. The experts stated that dogs develop a permanent sound phobia or excessive fear of loud noises and may develop epilepsy and other nervous signs due to bursting of crackers during Diwali. These dogs may unreasonably hide from people, urinate, defecate, drool, pant and develop separation anxiety. Dr SS Randhawa, director of veterinary clinics, GADVASU, stated that pet and stray dogs are very sensitive to this continuous noise and become restless, run away and exhibit signs of anxiety or stress. This happens as the auditory pain threshold in dogs is approximately 95 decibels, which much lesser than humans. Fireworks usually produce a sound of 190 decibels, which is harmful for the human ears too. Dr Randhawa stated that noise of crackers can be harmful and dogs may then be scared of even harmless sounds like opening of a doors or sound of doorbells. Stray dogs may get seriously injured because of accidents. Moreover, poisonous gases and harmful particulate matter may lead to severe lung oedema in them and is also dangerous for people already who have respiratory diseases like asthma. The steps which can be taken to keep pet dogs safe include stopping the bursting of crackers, keeping them indoors, keeping the radio or television set on to distract them from loud noises, playing with them to distract them from outside noises, covering the pets with blankets and keeping a first-aid kit ready with dressing material, antiseptics, analgesic and medicines. Emergency services to remain open on Diwali The experts stated that the emergency veterinary doctor will be available on Diwali day and night and the residents should immediately contact the veterinarian if they note any signs of anxiety or stress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/gadvasu-experts-issue-advisory-to-keep-dogs-safe-during-diwali-101635877487699.html

After successful launch, the drive will be run across the country,” said a VHP office bearer. A draft proposal in this regard was placed and discussed at a meeting of the VHP held at its provincial office in Prayagraj on Sunday. During this, VHP national vice president and general secretary of Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust, Champat Rai was also present, he added. VHP regional organisation secretary of Eastern Uttar Pradesh, Gajendra Singh said that people from all over the country supported the Shri Ram Temple being built in Ayodhya and this sequence continues even now. “The organisation believes that along with Ayodhya, temples of each village and locality should equally be grand and become the centre of faith and religious rights of the people. For this, the VHP workers and office bearers will select a temple in their respective areas and start the process of its restoration,” he said. In this context, along with taking the help of the local people, the organisation would also cooperate with its resources. If there is any difficulty in the maintenance of the temple, then the workers of the organisation would cooperate in that too, Gajendra Singh said. The help, rendered by VHP, would be in all aspect, be it financially, physically or ideologically, he added Singh further informed that the temples, which would be renovated with the help of the local people and the VHP, would be used to discuss the problems being faced by the locals along with organising ‘satsangs’. Such temples could also become a centre of ‘family satsang,’ started by VHP, Singh said. An action plan for the Gaushalas to be operated in the area would also be prepared from these temples as these would emerge as a communication center of ‘Sanatan culture’. The message of harmony in the society would also be given through these temples. It would play an important role in the integration of Hindus, he explained. “The block level group of VHP, which is presently active in the given area will also look after the work related to the temple, as no other officer or worker of VHP will be given any responsibility for this,” he added. VHP officials said that issues like conversion and ‘love jihad’ were also discussed in the Sunday meeting and it was decided that there is a need to take concrete steps to bring public awareness to curb it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/prayagraj-vhp-calls-for-restoration-maintenance-of-neglected-temples-in-villages-towns-101635876887949.html

02-11-2021||Noida||Noida: Probe ordered into irregularities in issuing certificates to industrial units||The Uttar Pradesh government has ordered a probe into alleged violations in issuing functional certificates to factories and industrial units in different sectors of Noida. The move comes after complaints were filed against the industry department of the Noida authority alleging that the department issued functional certificates in violation of the norms. As per the norms, if an industrial unit or a factory becomes operational, then the authority issues a ‘functional certificate’ certifying that the business operations are underway at the site and the plot is being used for the purpose for which it was allotted. Before issuance of a functional certificate, the industry department of the authority checks all the documents of the unit and also conducts an inspection at the site, said officials.“We got a complaint stating that the industry department issued a functional certificate in complete violations of the laid down rules. A functional certificate was issued illegally as the industrial plot owner had not started any operations at the site. We have directed the Uttar Pradesh infrastructure and industrial development department to probe into the allegations. We have directed the officials to probe into all functional certificates issued since July 2020,” said Satish Mahana, UP industry minister who ordered the probe last week.The UP infrastructure and industrial development department directed Noida authority’s chief executive officer (CEO) Ritu Maheshwari to investigate into the allegations. Following directions, the CEO has formed a three-member committee headed by authority’s additional CEO Neha Sharma. Other two members of the committee are chief financial officer and work circle engineer.“We have started the probe and are gathering all relevant files. We are compiling the data as to how many functional certificates have been issued since July, 2020. Once we have all the figures, we will be able to fix the officials’ accountability,” said Sharma, additional CEO of the authority.According to the complaint, the industry department staff issued functional certificate illegally and indulged in corruption. The violations took place because the authority in early 2020 started cancelling the allotment of plots due to delay in starting industrial operations, the complaint said.“The authority started cancelling allotment of plots, where no industry or factory was operational at the site. To evade action, the plot owners got functional certificates issued in violation of norms. If the allegations are found to be true, we will act against officials responsible,” said Mahana.Noida has at least 12,000 industrial units in different sectors.“The authority should finish the probe at the earliest and take appropriate action in this matter, as it vitiates the business atmosphere. The government must take stern action against officials and others involved in the alleged irregularities,” said Vipin Malhan, president of Noida Entrepreneur Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-probe-ordered-into-irregularities-in-issuing-certificates-to-industrial-units-101635876227955.html

02-11-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad most polluted for fourth time since October 15||The Ghaziabad city continued to be the most polluted city in the country for the second consecutive day on Tuesday. The city’s air quality index (AQI), according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) bulletin, was recorded at 334 (‘very poor’), the highest across the country, but slightly lower than Monday’s 363.This is the fourth time since October 15 this year, when the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) was implemented, that the city has emerged the most polluted one ahead of Diwali. The last three occasions when the city topped the pollution chart were on October 16 (with an AQI of 349), October 29 (AQI of 321) and November 1 (AQI of 363).According to the CPCB, the primary pollutant on Tuesday was PM2.5 at all the four monitoring stations at Indirapuram, Loni, Sanjay Nagar and Vasundhara.In neighbouring Noida, the AQI was recorded at 303, while Greater Noida’s AQI stood at 276 (‘poor’), showed the CPCB data.“The primary pollutant (PM2.5) indicates that high traffic volume on roads has resulted in high emissions. Further, the external factors like stubble burning have also contributed to the city’s pollution. On our part, we are taking up regular inspections, including night patrolling in industrial areas and construction sites, to check for violations,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB.“However, during the current pre-Diwali period, Ghaziabad has fared better in terms of pollution levels which are lower than the pre-Diwali days’ figures in the last year. The rise in AQI in Noida can also be attributed to the high number of vehicles on roads due to the festival season,” Sharma added.According to the CPCB, the weekly average AQI before Diwali in 2020 was 412, as against 317 during the corresponding period this year.An AQI reading between 101 and 200 is considered ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 is ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and above 400 is considered ‘severe’.Environmentalists said that traffic snarls across Ghaziabad due to the festive season are responsible for high pollution levels. “Snarls are rampant even in small lanes and bylanes of the city. This is leading to high vehicular emission and causing city’s AQI to deteriorate,” said Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist.Meanwhile, the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) has predicted that the AQI is likely to remain in ‘very poor’ category for the next two days in Delhi.“Impact of stubble burning is expected to be low due to unfavourable winds coming from south-west and east direction. Share of crop residue burning emissions in PM2.5 is about 6% (effective fire count 1,795). Prevailing shallow mixing layer height reduces dispersion of pollutants,” the Safar forecast added.It further said that from November 4 to 6, the expected share of stubble burning in PM2.5 is likely to be in the range of 20-38%.According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality early warning system for Delhi, the air quality of the national capital is likely to remain in lower end of ‘very poor’ to ‘poor’ category on November 2 and 3. “The air quality is likely to be in lower end of very poor category on November 4. The air quality is likely to deteriorate on November 5 and 6 but remain in very poor category. PM2.5 to be the predominant pollutant,” the forecast added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-most-polluted-for-fourth-time-since-october-15-101635876167787.html

However, in the last two years, a few communal elements have been trying to vitiate the atmosphere by opposing peaceful Friday prayers,” a statement issued by the group at the press conference read.Altaf Ahmad, a member of the group, said that the members of the Muslim community were forced to offer namaz in open because the city lacked mosques, particularly in newer parts of the city. “We have asked the government to provide us land in different parts of the city so that we can build mosques. But till this happens, the administration must ensure that namaz is offered peacefully and no one is allowed to create disturbance,” he said. The campaign against hatemongering will run online as well as offline, to counter instances of hatred through fake news and false allegations. “A platform will be made available for all those who disagree with the current campaign against the Friday namaz and who stand for a united Gurgaon for harmony and progress,” said Arti Jaiman, a member of the Manch, who also heads a community radio station. Kulbhushan Bhardwaj, the legal advisor for Sanyukt Hindu Sangarsh Samiti, a Hindu group, said, “We only ask that religious practices should not be allowed in public.” Yash Garg, deputy commissioner, Gurugram, said that all efforts are being made to resolve the issue peacefully and through consensus. “A committee of stakeholders will discuss the issue and find resolution,” said Garg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/namaz-row-civil-society-group-calls-for-protection-of-constitutional-rights-101635875989373.html

The roads dry up soon after and it has no long-term impact. We objected to it during an internal district-level pollution meeting last month. However, it was dismissed by HSPCB [Haryana State Pollution Control Board].”Independent experts also agreed to the MCG official’s view, calling water sprinkling a “largely futile exercise.”Sachin Panwar, a city-based air quality expert, said, “Sprinkling of water has a maximum impact period of one hour, after which the road dries up and dust starts swirling around. The practice is a waste of resources and futile. Instead, the government should focus on increasing green cover around medians. Certain trees and plants with pointed leaves act as a barrier to check suspension of dust in the air.”However, officials of the HSPCB said that sprinkling of water is an important part of the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) that needs to be undertaken to control pollution.Kuldeep Singh, regional officer (north) for HSPCB, said, “Mechanised water sprinkling is an important way to control dust pollution that impacts the air quality in the city. During the festive season, we cannot stop people from going out or vehicles moving on the roads, but we can control the impact by implementing such measures across the city. Hence, this practice is needed.”Last year, the MCG had 40 water tankers to undertake sprinkling. Officials said that the 64 machines will be in addition to the 40 and will help with comprehensive coverage of the city.This year, the MCG has been carrying out sprinkling since early October, even before the official implementation of Grap started across the National Capital Region (NCR) on October 15.MCG officials said that water for sprinkling purposes will be procured from the sewerage treatment plants (STPs).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-to-procure-64-water-tankers-for-dust-control-measures-ahead-of-pollution-spike-101635875987796.html
02-11-2021||Gurugram||Air quality on brink of ‘very poor’, likely to worsen till Diwali||The air quality in Gurugram deteriorated on Tuesday, ahead of Diwali, inching closer to the ‘very poor’ category of the air quality index (AQI) according to the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) data. For a fifth consecutive day, the district reported ‘poor’ quality of air, recording an AQI of 287 on Tuesday, which was worse than a reading of 241 recorded on Monday. According to predictions, of experts, the pollution levels are likely to worsen and reach the ‘very poor’ category by Diwali. However, Gurugram fared relatively better than many of its counterparts in the National Capital Region on Tuesday, with Faridabad, Delhi, Noida and Ghaziabad recording AQI readings of 306, 303, 303 and 334, respectively, all of which were in the ‘very poor’ category of the CPCB system. According to the forecast of the Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi, the air quality in the National Capital Territory is likely to remain in the lower end of the ‘very poor’ to ‘poor’ category on Wednesday and the lower end of the ‘very poor’ category on Thursday (Diwali). A weather bulletin issued by the body on Tuesday evening stated that over the next five days, the air quality in the region is likely to deteriorate on Friday and Saturday and remain in the ‘very poor’ category, due to an expected increase in the particulate matter having a diameter of 2.5 microns or less (PM2.5), the major pollutant. Stepping up enforcement action ahead of Diwali, officials of the regional pollution control board in Gurugram said that patrolling will be increased during the day as well as at night. Kuldeep Singh, the regional officer of Haryana State Pollution Control Board for Gurugram (north), said, “During the day, sprinkling of water at pollution hotspots and other enforcement activities will be at the highest level. We have six teams across the district that will patrol during the night as well as day to check for violations. We have also requested builders in the district to carry out sprinkling at construction sites. We urge the public to not engage in bursting of crackers and stop others from doing so too.” Meanwhile, air quality experts in the city said that some respite is likely on November 7 and 8, with a likely increase in wind speed that will disperse pollutants. Sachin Panwar, a city-based independent air quality scientist, said, “With the impact of a western disturbance, wind speed is likely to pick up and increase to 16kmph from the 4kmph on November 7-8. From Monday onwards, the wind direction has changed from northwestern to northeastern, which helps in carrying away the pollutants. Light rain or drizzle is also expected over the region a day or two after Diwali.” A western disturbance refers to the winds originating over the Mediterranean region that carry moisture in the form of rainfall or snowfall while travelling to the northern regions. According to the India Meteorological Department, Gurugram is likely to witness partly or generally cloudy sky on November 5 and 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/air-quality-on-brink-of-very-poor-likely-to-worsen-till-diwali-101635875929174.html

02-11-2021||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Health dept keeping Covid watch on homebound migrants ahead of Diwali||Learning a lesson from the festival of Holi when homebound migrant workers had caused a spike in Covid-19 cases earlier this year, the health authorities in Uttar Pradesh are taking no chances this Diwali.For instance, the district health department has deputed 22 teams at all prominent bus stations and railway stations of Prayagraj district for carrying out rapid antigen tests of all migrants returning for the Diwali festival. The department has also decided to carry out RT-PCR (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) tests of all samples collected from these home-bound migrant workers in the run-up to Diwali even if the rapid antigen tests are negative, officials said. RT-PCR is considered the gold standard of Covid tests by experts.Prayagraj district Covid-19 nodal officer Dr AK Tiwari said that special precautions were being taken for Diwali when thousands of migrant workers of UP return home for the festival from various states, including Maharashtra, Delhi, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh among others. “A total of 22 teams have been deployed at bus stands and railway stations. Every migrant is being screened. Even if the antigen test report is negative, the samples are being sent for RT-PCR tests with an aim not to miss any positive Covid-19 positive individual who could spread the pandemic in the district. Any person who is found positive will be isolated immediately,” he said.The nodal officer said even if the report of an antigen test from a private hospital returns negative, the samples would be sent for RT-PCR tests as a sure check. These efforts are meant to keep the pandemic from starting to spread again during the festive season. At present, Prayagraj has three active Covid-19 cases with one new case being found in the Tagore Town locality on Monday. The latest case was the first to be found after a gap of nine days.“Currently, 6000 RT-PCR tests are being done daily in the MLN Medical College. Apart from Prayagraj, samples from Pratapgarh, Mirzapur and Kaushambi are also being tested here,” he explained.Dr Sujit Verma, senior physician at SRN Hospital in Prayagraj, warned that the threat of Covid-19 was not over yet.“It is very important to follow the corona prevention guidelines during the festive season. Do not forget to maintain social distancing and wear facemasks. Frequently washing hands with soap still remains one of the most effective ways to protect oneself from the Covid-19 virus,” he said.Paediatrician Dr Yugantar Pandey said special care should be taken to protect children during Diwali as adults may have got the Covid-19 vaccination, but the kids remain vulnerable.“Wearing a facemask and avoiding overcrowded places is the best way to protect kids from the virus,” he said. In Varanasi, nigrani samitis (surveillance committees) will keep an eye on people returning to the villages from cities and inform the health department about the people with symptoms of Covid-19. The health department teams will reach the villages and provide medicines to the symptomatic people and antigen tests will be done, said chief medical officer Dr Rahul Singh.The department has not deployed any medical team for doing antigen tests at any of the railway stations here (Varanasi), he said.Each nigrani samiti comprises locals and works in coordination with the panchayati raj department which constituted them to keep a watch on villages to ensure 100% sanitation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uttar-pradesh-health-dept-keeping-covid-watch-on-homebound-migrants-ahead-of-diwali-101635875567782.html
02-11-2021||Mumbai||High court clears way for passenger, Ro-Ro jetties in Palghar and Thane||The Bombay high court (HC) recently cleared the way for the construction of the proposed passenger jetties at Kelwa and Kharekuran and Ro-Ro jetty at Kharwadashri in Palghar and Thane districts. The court gave its nod to the projects by the Maharashtra Maritime Board (MMB) after it was informed that the mangroves to be cut for the projects were not much and the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) and State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA) had granted approvals. The court, while refusing the request of the Bombay Environmental Action Group (BEAG) to stay its order, directed the MMB to give an undertaking that it would strictly comply with the terms and conditions stipulated in the approvals for the projects. The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing three petitions filed by MMB seeking the court’s permission for cutting mangroves that fell within the Coastal Zone Regulation-I (CRZ-I), where the projects were coming up, was informed by advocates Saket Mone and Subit Chakrabarti that the projects were of pure public utility and would benefit the citizens of Palghar. The three projects consist of the passenger jetty at Kelwa near fishermen’s jetty, Kharwadshri Ro-Ro jetty and the Kharekuran passenger jetty in Thane district. While advocates had submitted that the project at Kelwa would not only benefit the citizens in the vicinity by increasing tourism but would also provide an eco-friendly travel option for the local industries without cutting any mangroves. With regards to the Ro-Ro jetty, the MMB submitted that the MCZMA had granted permission to divert 0.478 hectares of mangrove area comprising 72 mangrove trees and the board would replant five times the number of mangroves being removed. The advocates for MMB further submitted that the environmental authorities had already given their approval as no mangroves would be cut. The MMB further stated that it was willing to abide by the conditions stipulated by the MCZMA and SIEAA in its approvals and hence the court should permit the board to commence construction at the three sites. Senior advocate Sharan Jagtiani for BEAG, however, objected to the petitions and said that the jetty at Kelwa could be constructed as an extension to the existing fishermen’s jetty, instead of having a fresh construction in the buffer zone. The bench referred to the CRZ notification of 2011 and observed that activities related to the waterfront were expressly permitted and setting up of a jetty was not deemed as a prohibited activity. Hence, it cleared the way for the construction of the projects provided the board strictly adhered to the conditions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/high-court-clears-way-for-passenger-ro-ro-jetties-in-palghar-and-thane-101635875507803.html

The police recovered around 700kg illegal firecrackers from the violators.The first person – Pawan Kumar, a resident of Tri Nagar – was arrested from west Delhi's Mundka area with 16.16kg firecrackers.Another person was nabbed on the intervening night of Sunday and Monday, while going towards Nangloi on a scooter with a plastic bag, a senior police officer said, as reported by PTI.When police intercepted the scooter and checked the bag, they found firecrackers in it, said deputy commissioner of police (outer) Parwinder Singh.Kumar told police he bought the firecrackers from Bahadurgarh in Haryana and wanted to sell them at his shop on Diwali, police said.In a similar incident, a 32-year-old woman was arrested from the Sultanpuri area with 25.5kg firecrackers after police received a tip-off. The accused was identified as Rani, a resident of P-4 Block. She informed police that she bought the firecrackers from Gurgaon to make quick money.Several others were arrested in a similar manner from Rohini, Sadar Bazaar and other parts of the national capital. Police recovered 570kg of completely banned non-green and green firecrackers from Rohini, while another 77.2kg worth of firecrackers were seized from the Sher Ka Pinjra area.The Delhi Pollution Control Committee had on September 28 ordered a complete ban on the sale and bursting of firecrackers in the national capital till January 1, 2022.

Though Gunaram had sought an ambulance to take his wife to the sub-divisional health hospital in Anandpur, by the time it arrived, his wife had already delivered the baby.While Gunaram’s wife and the newborn were being taken to the hospital, some foetal blood fell on the floor of his house which reportedly upset the villagers. “The village headman and others said as per customs if a woman is sent to hospital after the delivery of the baby then the village is desecrated. I was asked to give three roosters, handia (a local brew) and some puja material for the purification of the village. I refused the same as I consider these superstitious practices,” said Gunaram.The tribal youth alleged that after his refusal, his family was socially boycotted following which he lodged a case with Ghasipura police station on November 1. Sub-inspector of Ghasipura police station, Manas Ranjan Panda, who went to the village to inquire into the allegations, said, villagers were upset over foetal blood falling on the floor.“They wanted penance. I held a discussion with the villagers and sorted out the issue,” said the sub-inspector.Health department officials in Keonjhar, however, said institutional delivery in the district was 98 per cent in 2020-21, up from 72.2 per cent in 2015-16. As per the state’s health management information system, the institutional delivery in Odisha in 2020-21 was 82 per cent, down from 85.3 per cent in 2015-16 (as per NFHS-4 figures), but health officials expressed hope that the NFHS-5 figures, which are due to be out for Odisha in a few weeks, would be close to 90 per cent.Additional district medical officer (family welfare), Koenjhar, Dr Pranatini Nayak said institutional deliveries in the district have been going up steadily due to targetted intervention over the last few years. “There may be some superstition among some tribal communities but more and more pregnant tribal women are coming to deliver their babies at hospitals,” she said.Health activists said despite state schemes like Mamata and central schemes like Janani Sishu Suraksha Karyakram, which promote institutional delivery, tribal districts like Keonjhar are beset with problems such as superstition. “In Mayurbhanj and Keonjhar districts, local tribals still prefer to visit the local doctor for their ailments and prefer to carry out childbirth at home despite availing the benefits of government schemes like Mamata and JSSK. The tribals there believe that the Gods will be angry if they go to a hospital instead of consulting a local doctor. Besides, in 381 community health centres across the state, there are just about 124 gynaecologists, which hampers childbirths at such centres,” said Gouranga Mohapatra, state convenor of Jana Swasthya Abhiyan, an NGO working on health issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/odisha-tribal-couple-take-newborn-to-hospital-allege-facing-social-boycott-101635874909295.html
02-11-2021||Pune||CM in Baramati heaps praise on Sharad Pawar and family; taunting BJP||PUNE: Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday lavished praise on Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar and his family for their development vision. Thackeray was speaking at the inauguration of the Incubation and Innovation Centre and Scientific Research Institute at Baramati, Sharad Pawar’s hometown. Sharad Pawar and Ajit Pawar too were present at the occasion. The three leaders met on the day NCP leader and former state home minister Anil Deshmukh was arrested and remanded to the Enforcement Directorate’s (ED’s) custody in a money laundering case. Earlier, the Thackeray-led Shiv Sena broke its alliance with the Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) and formed the government in Maharashtra by striking another alliance with the NCP and Congress party.Speaking at the event, Thackeray called Sharad Pawar a “youthful leader” who has shown the “Sun of development” to everyone. “Sharad Pawar is leading the state. He is leading several such institutes here and while he is continuously working, his family too is working tirelessly towards one obsession namely, development,” Thackeray said. Commenting on his former criticism of Sharad Pawar, Thackeray said that in politics, opponents are a must. “We were opponents and we used to criticise each other as well but the entire world knows about the friendship between Sharad Pawar and Sena supremo late Balasaheb Thackeray. Balasaheb used to tell us that we should go to Baramati and see what Sharad Pawar has done over there,” the CM said. Referring to the incubation centre, Thackeray, in a thinly-veiled reference to the snapping of ties between the Sena and BJP after the 2019 Maharashtra assembly polls, said that there should be an incubation centre in politics as well. “We (Shiv Sena) had opened one incubation centre 25 years ago. We also hatched some unwanted eggs and everyone knows what happened later,” Thackeray said. The CM said that Ajit Pawar was telling him that Baramati would become the number 2 centre in education after Pune. “According to me, as far as teaching lessons in politics is concerned, Baramati is already number one. I am sure the way Pawar and his family are working towards development, it will become one of the best centres not only in Maharashtra but in the whole country,” he said. The CM appreciated the Agricultural Development Trust in Baramati for bringing best practices from abroad and implementing them. He lauded Sharad Pawar for bringing about a transformational change in Baramati and the surrounding areas.On his part, Sharad Pawar said that the Agricultural Development Trust has constantly strived for innovation and thanked the CM for visiting Baramati and inaugurating the innovation centre. “The trust strives to use the best innovative practices and knowledge available in institutes worldwide and in India and use them in rural areas,” the NCP chief said. Sharad Pawar said he would strive to set up a centre of artificial intelligence in Baramati.In response, the CM assured full support of the state government and said he would never come in the way of good work and that if there are obstacles and red tape, those too will be removed. “We have to do all those things that will make our state not only the number one in the country but also in the world and we will do it for sure,” he said. Wishing everyone a happy Diwali, he said that some people are talking about bursting bombs after the festival. “I would like to tell them that burst bombs, burst crackers, but ensure that there is no smoke as we are yet to overcome Covid-19,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/cm-in-baramati-heaps-praise-on-sharad-pawar-and-family-taunting-bjp-101635874607823.html
02-11-2021||Mumbai||Vinod Rai must apologise to the entire nation: Ajay Maken||Senior Congress leader and former Union minister Ajay Maken on Tuesday demanded an apology by former Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) Vinod Rai for his false report on 2G allotment and questioned Anna Hazare, Kiran Bedi and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal for their silence on the poor implementation of the Lokpal, for which they led the nationwide protest in 2013.Maken who addressed a press conference in Mumbai on Tuesday said that Vinod Rai should tender an apology to the entire nation for his sham report on 2G spectrum, which highlighted a presumptive loss of ₹1.76 lakh crore. “The report was a figment of imagination. The then principal 2G spectrum auditor RP Singh had told the joint parliamentary committee that no loss has been caused to the exchequer. The special judge in December 2017 had said that the prosecution (Central Bureau of Investigation) miserably failed to prove any charge against any of the accused. Rai has tendered an unconditional apology to Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam for his false statement, but he should apologise to the nation for his falsehood,” he said.Maken said why the self-proclaimed crusaders against corruption are silent on the poor state of Lokpal. “Baba Ramdev, Arvind Kejriwal, Kiran Bedi participated in the protest under the leadership of Anna Hazare pressing for the Lokpal Bill, which was passed in 2014. However, the Lokpal came into existence only in March 2019. Until today, the director of prosecution or director of inquiry has not been appointed under it. The Lokpal cannot work unless these posts are filled. Lokpal received 1,427 complaints in 2019 and 110 in 2020 and just 30 this year. This means the Lokpal has become dysfunctional. The question here is why the people who were fighting for it are silent now,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/vinod-rai-must-apologise-to-the-entire-nation-ajay-maken-101635874487631.html
02-11-2021||Noida||As pollution rises, Ghaziabad admin says no to licence for selling green crackers||The higher than ‘moderate’ average air quality index (AQI) of Ghaziabad for the month of October has prompted the district administration to not issue any licence for the sale of green crackers this Diwali, said officials on Tuesday. On October 29, the Uttar Pradesh government passed an order allowing the use and sale of green crackers for not more than two hours in areas where the AQI is “moderate” or better. The state government’s order stated that the UP Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) monitored the air quality of 27 cities, including Ghaziabad and Noida, and found that the average AQI in these cities were under the “moderate” category from January to September this year. “We sought monthly average data from UPPCB. It indicated that the average AQI in October remained over the ‘moderate’ category. Hence, we have decided to not issue licences for the sale of green crackers this Diwali. We will enforce the directions with the help of police,” said district magistrate Gambhir Singh. On Tuesday, Ghaziabad continued to be the most polluted city in the country for the second consecutive day. The city’s AQI, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) bulletin, was recorded at 334 (‘very poor’), which is slightly lower than Monday’s 363. Traders dealing in the sale of green crackers said the decision of the administration has ruined their business prospects this year. “We approached the district officials several times, but they did not provide us the basis of their decision. Our entire investment is stuck and families of traders will suffer this Diwali,” said Ashutosh Gupta, president of retail cracker traders association, Ghaziabad. Environmentalists said that the authorities were unable to control the rise in pollution levels and as a result, the traders are now at the receiving end. “Air pollution is showing an increasing trend this season. Different departments make plans every year to control pollution, but they fail to have any effect on ground. The high volume of traffic and road repair works have also led to the deterioration of air quality,” said Sushil Raghav, a city-based environmentalist. UPPCB officials said they have initiated a survey in the city to find out ongoing road repair works. “The survey is being carried out in all the five zones and a report will be compiled. Based on the report, we will calculate the environment compensation cost (ECC) and levy penalties against the Ghaziabad municipal corporation. The deadline of completing road repair works already ended on October 30,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB. Municipal commissioner MS Tanwar said 95% of the road repair works are complete while the surface relaying works are 35% done. “During a video conference with state officials, we were told that the deadline for completing the works has been extended by 15 days. We are likely to finish a large chunk of the work in the next 15 days,” said Tanwar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/as-pollution-rises-ghaziabad-admin-says-no-to-licence-for-selling-green-crackers-101635874427728.html

02-11-2021||Pune||Oct sees 168 confirmed dengue cases, nominal drop from Sept in PMC||PUNE: As per Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) health department data, October saw a total 168 and 38 confirmed cases of dengue and chikungunya, which is just a marginal drop compared to September’s 192 and 80 confirmed cases of dengue and chikungunya, respectively. October also saw 408 suspected cases of dengue, up from 392 suspected cases of the infection in September. As of the end of October, the city reported 2,483 suspected and 563 confirmed cases of dengue and 218 confirmed cases of chikungunya. The civic body issued notices to 2,359 commercial and residential properties found to be mosquito breeding spots and collected a total Rs175,950 from the offenders. Now that the monsoon has receded, it might still take some time for the number of mosquito-borne infections to fall. In November, the infections are likely to come down.Dr Sanjeev Wavare, assistant health officer with the PMC, said, “It has been observed now since the past several years that in the month of October, the number of dengue cases, both suspected and confirmed, usually goes up because of multiple factors, primarily environmental factors like the receding monsoon, October heat and high humidity levels.

02-11-2021||Noida||Farmers protest against Noida authority, block key road over land compensation||Traffic movement was disrupted for more than an hour on the Delhi-Noida side of the link road on Tuesday afternoon after a group of nearly 1,000 farmers blocked a stretch of the key road near Noida’s Sector 15A. The farmers from nearly 80 villages of Noida have been protesting against the Noida authority for the past two months, demanding hiked land compensation and residential land settlement.On Monday, the farmers announced that they will lay siege to the residence of local member of Parliament Dr Mahesh Sharma in Sector 15A in protest against the policies of the Noida authority. The authority officials said that the farmers have been given a space in Harola village near the authority’s Sector 6 administrative building for the protest.The farmers marched from Harola village to the Sharma’s residence on foot at 1.30pm on Tuesday. During this, the traffic movement was disrupted on the city’s main road -- Udyog Marg -- for almost half an hour as one side of the road was blocked completely till the protesters crossed the Delhi-Noida link road, where Sector 15A is located.Police stopped the protesting farmers when they tried to break gate number 1 of Sector 15A to reach Sharma’s residence. Later, they tried to break gate number 2 which was already closed to stop them near the gate. When the police stopped the farmers at gate number 2, they sat on the Delhi-Noida link road for half an hour. They left the protest site only after Sharma reached the spot and assured them help.“We will take the farmers’ issues to the highest level, be it the chief minister or the Prime Minister... so that their issues can be addressed at the earliest,” said Sharma.Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police, said, “We made sure that the farmers do not create law and order issues during the protest. It was a peaceful protest, and they left the road after meeting the MP.”Farmer leaders said that the Noida authority’s policies and functioning are completely against the farmers who gave their land for the development of the industrial town. “The authority’s officials are harassing the farmers by issuing notices, demolishing houses, not giving hiked land compensation and residential plots. Our protest will continue until our demands are met,” said Sukhbir Yadav, leader of the Kisan Ekta Parishad.For the past two months, the farmers reach the Harola protest site daily at 12pm, and return to their homes in the evening. They also raise slogans against the authority officials during their sit-in.The farmers said they are not ready to get a map approved before constructing their buildings, as asked by the authority. “How can the Noida authority restrict our houses or life? Our villages have been ruined by the bad policies of the authority,” said Surendra Chauhan, another farmer leader.Indu Prakash Singh, officer on special duty, Noida authority, said, “We are trying to pacify the farmers by addressing their legitimate demands.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/farmers-protest-against-noida-authority-block-key-road-over-land-compensation-101635873831284.html

The suspect, identified as Priyanshu Prakhar, a native of Muzaffarpur in Bihar, used multiple SIM cards obtained with forged documents to cheat people. He was operating from a flat in Pan Oasis in Noida’s Sector 70, said police. Vivek Trivedi, station house officer (SHO) of Phase 3 police station, said on Tuesday, Prakhar ordered 14 pre-activated SIM cards from a company and gave his neighbour’s address in Noida for the delivery of the consignment to escape surveillance. “When the delivery boy reached the given address, the flat owner told him that he had not ordered for the goods. At that time, Prakhar reached there and said he had placed the order and mentioned his neighbour’s address by mistake,” he said. The flat owner suspected foul play as to why would a person give his address. He then dialled 112, following which a police team reached the spot. The police team opened the packet and found several pre-activated SIM cards. The police then searched Prakhar’s flat and recovered four mobile phones with SIM cards, one laptop, six diaries, ₹20,000 cash, nine debit cards, four Aadhaar cards, and one voter ID. During interrogation, Prakhar revealed he was operating from a flat and cheating people on the pretext of facilitating loans, KYC, and also jobs using SIM cards that have been obtained with forged documents. Sub-inspector Lokesh Kumar filed a complaint in this regard. Prakhar revealed he was cheating people with the help of two of his accomplices, who are on the run. A case has been registered against the three people under Sections 420 (cheating) and 406 (criminal breach of trust) of the IPC. “The suspect was produced in court and sent to judicial custody,” said the SHO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/man-gets-sim-cards-delivered-at-neighbour-s-address-in-noida-held-for-fraud-101635873827471.html

Teams of the Noida police also inspected several shopping malls and markets in the district on Tuesday.Vehicles coming from Sector 16 to Botanic Garden via Sector 18 were diverted to the left side of the Atta Peer. People had to use the next roundabout to continue to reach their destinations. Similarly, vehicles coming from Botanic Garden to Noida Sector 16 were diverted to the left side to the Film City underpass. They need to reach DLF Mall Sector 18 and exit from the Atta Peer.The traffic police said that vehicles coming from the Noida Film City will take the same route to reach Sector 16. Vehicles coming from Noida Sector 28/30 will have to use the same route -- Film City underpass and then the Atta Peer.Amit Gupta, a resident of Prateek Wisteria in Sector 77, who visited the market for shopping on Tuesday, said that unauthorised parking and vendors add to problems in Sector 18 and Atta Market. “They create nuisance mainly under the Sector 18 metro station. The traffic police should launch frequent enforcement drives to clear the stretch,” he said.Traffic movement remained smooth around the market on Tuesday evening.SK Jain, president of Noida sector 18 market association, said that many people visited the market for Dhanteras shopping on Tuesday. “Traffic police had made some diversions, which led to inconvenience to the people who came by commercial vehicles.

02-11-2021||Noida||Noida residents rush for last-minute shopping ahead of Diwali||Festive cheer is back on the streets of Gautam Budh Nagar as people rushed to the markets in the city to buy jewellery among other items on the occasion of Dhanteras that was observed on Tuesday as well as to complete their last-minute shopping ahead of Diwali that will be observed on November 4. From vibrant wall hangings to LED diyas and candles, markets are abuzz with shoppers looking to amplify their Diwali décor as the festival of lights will be celebrated after almost a year following the Covid-19 outbreak. At Atta Market in Noida’s Sector 27, paper lanterns, floating diyas were a hit among buyers. “My son wanted us to buy paper lanterns as we will not be bursting crackers this season. We found various designs of these lanterns, which were selling for ₹1000- ₹1500 for a set of five or ten,” said Nutan Chaturvedi, a shopper at Atta market. Markets were also flooded with artificial rangoli stickers of various designs, which can be pasted on the floor and saves time for those who have little patience to learn the complex and delicate art of making rangolis. “Alternatives for rangoli making, like a sieve with patterns embossed on them, are also available in the market. Residents are opting for the green way by going for rangoli colours made of flowers and edible items. Glittering rangoli powder has also gained popularity,” said Reeta Bahuguna, a shopkeeper at Atta Market. C B Jha, president of Atta Market Traders Welfare Association, said the crowd in the market has swelled in the last fortnight. “Last year, Diwali festivities were muted but this year, pre-Covid celebrations seem to be returning to the streets of Noida. However, we have instructed shopkeepers in the market to ensure proper Covid appropriate behaviour, maintain social distancing and not allow anyone in the shops without face masks,” said Jha.Shopping malls too are witnessing record footfalls as was seen during pre-Covid days. “With malls reopening after the second wave of Covid-19, we are witnessing a consistent growth in footfall. Sales have picked up, just as in pre-Covid times, as consumer sentiment has improved due to faster vaccinations. We are receiving phenomenal response from our patrons and with festive season round the corner, we are confident that the retail sector and the food and beverage businesses will recover and witness a steady growth,” said Manish Mehrotra, vice president and centre head, DLF Mall of India, Sector 18, Noida. According to traders in Noida, shoppers seemed to be in an upbeat mood on the occasion of Dhanteras. Sushil Kumar Jain, national treasurer of All India Jewellers’ and GoldSmith Federation and president of Sector 18 Market Association said business boomed unexpectedly this festive season. “As per our estimates, goods of more than ₹1500 crore have been sold in Noida’s markets on Dhanteras. This includes sale of around ₹350 crore of gold jewellery, electronic items worth ₹300 crore, garments worth ₹150 crore, gift items worth ₹250 crore. The sale of decorative items and utensils raked in ₹50 crore each, furniture sales were reported at ₹250 crore and the sale of other miscellaneous items garnered another ₹250 crore,” said Jain. While many shoppers rushed to jewellery stores, there are some who still prefer to buy jewellery from their family jeweller. “Though a lot of options are available online but my family always comes to our family jeweller in Sector 18 market on Dhanteras every year. It is a family tradition and seems more convenient as well since our jeweller knows our taste and is also able to remake old designs of jewellery that my mother wants,” said Ashok Bansal, a shopper at Sector 18 market and a resident of Sector 50.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-residents-rush-for-last-minute-shopping-ahead-of-diwali-101635873648936.html

The company expects to get water in the coming days.“We are looking at the possibilities of how water can be provided to the company. Soon the arrangement will be made,” said anofficial from the water department the PMC, on condition of anonymity.Biovet, is an associate firm of Bharat Biotech, manufacturer of Covid vaccines.Last month, the company sent an application for approval to the Food Drug and Administration (FDA), which the FDA approved.Earlier in May, collector Rajesh Deshmukh and district administrator Saurabh Rao had detailed discussions with Bharti Biotech officials, with the plant expected to play a big role in the Covid vaccination drive in Pune district.The Pune Manjri unit is one of four units expected to scale production of Covaxin doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/biovet-seeks-pmc-water-supply-to-produce-covaxin-101635873647528.html
02-11-2021||Lucknow||In UP’s Prayagraj, this Diwali gift pack helping poor elderly live with dignity||At a time when people in Sangam city are busy exchanging Diwali presents, a gift pack comprising five “Panchgavya Deepaks” (lamps made of five natural elements) in a set of 21 “diyas” (earthen lamps) made by poor elderly people is attracting many.Introduced by an NGO, Retirement India Foundation, which is providing lunch tiffin to city elders at a nominal cost of Re 1, the gift hamper of these eco-friendly diyas is further coming in handy in providing additional financial help to the poor elderly people of the city this festive season. “To keep many senior citizens engaged in some creative work and at the same time making them earn, the foundation has introduced a novel concept of training them in making of ‘Panchgavya Deepak’ at their homes. Sourced from South India and trained on hand-held moulding machines, these senior citizens’ groups can produce a few thousand ‘Gau Diyas’,” said NGO director Raaj Gulati. “The NGO then purchases these especially made eco-friendly and healthy diyas from these poor elders and pack them in a gift pack of 21 diyas. “Our NGO and many of the families in the city have purchased this gift pack and gifted the same to their loved ones this Diwali,” he added.“After assessing the feedback of our initiative, called ‘Hamare Diye, Aapke Liye’ (our lamps for you), our NGO plans to provide a global online market to products made by these senior citizens’ groups which would make them more self-reliant,” said Gulati. “’Panchgavya’ is a mixture used in traditional Hindu rituals that is prepared by mixing five ingredients. The three direct constituents are cow milk, dung, urine while the other two are derived products, including curd and ghee. These are mixed in proper ratio and then allowed to ferment,” he added. The material thus prepared is put in a moulding machine, giving shape to beautiful diyas.“’Panchgavya diya’ is a chemical free formulation with no charcoal or carbon footprints. The diya also burns out and this ‘Panchgavya’ composition promotes oxygen generation and also produces the phenomenal number of beneficial gases that fight pollution effectively. The residue is used as manure,” Gulati said. The society must come forward to support and improve the quality of life of our senior citizens, he appealed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/in-up-s-prayagraj-this-diwali-gift-pack-helping-poor-elderly-live-with-dignity-101635873467974.html
02-11-2021||Pune||Amidst lower demand, Maharashtra to get 20 million Covid-19 vaccine doses in Nov||PUNE The state government is likely to get at least 20 million Covid-19 doses from the Centre for the vaccination drive, despite the lower demand, as many have shown a hesitancy in taking the second dose after second wave has waned. Even though there has been a steady supply of the vaccine, demand has gone down drastically since October, mainly due to the mandatory 84-day gap between two doses and the drop in Covid-19 cases. The state has about seven million doses pending to be administered from the October stock, officials said. Dr Sachin Desai, state immunisation officer said, “We are likely to get about 20 million doses of the vaccine this month and we have about 7 million pending as part of October’s stock.” In October, Maharashtra received 20 million doses of the Serum Institute manufactured Covishield and the Bharat Biotech produced Covaxin. Earlier on Sunday, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray expressed a concern over the slow pace of anti-Covid inoculation in Maharashtra, saying he will take up the issue of vaccine shortages with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The chief minister also addressed the issue of vaccine hesitancy and urged more people to shed their inhibitions and get vaccinated.“Let us first focus on the task at hand, that is to get more and more people vaccinated and boost the health infrastructure in the state,” the CM had said while speaking informally to journalists in Mumbai, when asked about about his government’s long-term plan to contain the pandemic. According to Desai, the health department is supplying doses on demand to districts. “As of now the availability of vaccines is not at all the problem. We are supplying as many vaccines as is being demanded by the district administrations in the state. We are conducting massive Information, Education and Communication (IEC) programmes to educate people of the need to be fully vaccinated rather than just take one dose. Even smaller districts are getting a smooth supply of the vaccines because we have distributed the stock to regional centres to decentralise the process,” said Desai. Until October 31, the state has administered a total of 98.17 million doses, including both first and second doses, to all the categories of beneficiaries. Of these a majority of the chunk has been supplied to Mumbai district (island and suburban), 14.67 million doses, 12.10 million doses to Pune district and Thane with 8.23 million doses. Maharashtra has been administering the highest doses of vaccines among all the states in the country.PMC increases second-dose quotaThe Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has upped its quota for the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine to 90%, as the demand for the first dose of vaccination has gone down in the city. Earlier, the second dose quota was 60%, which is now increased to 90%. In Pune city, over 105% people 18-144 age group have been vaccinated with the first dose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/amidst-lower-demand-maharashtra-to-get-20-million-covid-19-vaccine-doses-in-nov-101635873107485.html
02-11-2021||Lucknow||Vrindavan widows celebrate Diwali||Like in the past years, widows living in various ashrams of Vrindavan celebrated Diwali this year too on the Yamuna banks there on Tuesday. Maintaining social distancing, around hundred widows gathered at historic Kesi ghat on the Yamuna river in Vrindavan and lit colourful “diyas” (earthen lamps) and made “Rangoli”. They also chanted Krishna bhajans and danced to celebrate the occasion.“This is the ninth year in a row when widows participated in the celebration of lights. This programme was organised by Sulabh Hope Foundation under social reformer Dr Bindeshwar Pathak. Earlier, as per Hindu tradition, these widows were not allowed to take part in any such rituals and were treated as inauspicious,” said Vinita Verma, vice president, of Sulabh Hope Foundation.“Thousands of widows, mostly from West Bengal, have been living in Vrindavan for decades,” added Verma. One of the widows, Manu Ghosh, said, “Motivated by the series of revolutionary initiatives, widows are now happy and enjoying their stay in Vrindavan.”With the aim of bringing a ray of happiness in the lives of these widows, social reformer Dr Bindeshwar Pathak, founder of Sulabh Movement, came up with this idea to organise the festival of lights, especially for the widows living in various ashrams in Vrindavan and Varanasi in 2012, claimed the organisers.“On a routine basis, Sulabh provides them medical facilities and vocational training besides meeting their day-to-day needs so that they do not feel left out during the twilight years of their lives,” said Vinita Verma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/vrindavan-widows-celebrate-diwali-101635872807711.html
02-11-2021||Patna||Bihar bypolls: Jury out on Lalu’s impact||Political observers in Bihar are divided over the impact an ailing Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad has been able to make on the results of the bypolls for two assembly seats in the state. For Prasad, who returned to Bihar in the last week of October for the first time since December 2017 when he was jailed in Jharkhand in fodder scam cases, this was the first election campaign since 2015.And the results have been mixed. Chief minister Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United), which had won Tarapur in 2000 state polls by over 7,000 votes, has managed to retain the seat, but only with a margin of less than 4,000 votes.Party leaders said it was Prasad’s idea to field a Vaishya community candidate from Tarapur as an experiment to woo the sizeable number of voters from the traders’ community, considered to be traditional vote bank of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance.In Kusheshwar Asthan, a Congress stronghold till it went to JD(U) in 2020, RJD snubbed its ally and fielded its own candidate. In 2020, Congress has contested the seat as part of RJD-led alliance and lost by nearly 7,000 votes. This time, RJD finished second, trailing JD(U) by nearly 12,000 votes. Congress, however, lost its deposit. “We may have lost, but we fought strongly in both the seats. In Kusheshwar Asthan, we have done very well despite contesting the seat after a long time,” said RJD’s Tejashwi Prasad Yadav.Experts believe Congress’s dismal performance in both seats has given ammunition to the RJD chief to justify his decision of contesting Kusheshwar Asthan too, in case there is a patch-up with the ally.“Lalu took the decision of contesting both the seats unilaterally as a calculated move to assess the party’s political base in constituencies where it has not put up candidates in the past elections. He knows there are no immediate elections in the next two years and there is always a scope of patching up with the Congress high command in the longer run,” says D M Diwakar, an avid political observer and former director of A N Sinha Institute of Social Sciences. Diwakar is of the view that RJD’s performance in the bypolls would have been much worse has Lalu not joined the campaign. “ Lalu is still a charismatic leader and his presence in Patna did give fillip to the party in performing better,” he says.However, political analyst and former principal of Patna College, Nawal Kishore Choudhary, is convinced there was no “Lalu factor” in the bypolls. “There was no impact of the RJD chief in the polls. RJD always had a political base in the two seats and Tejashwi got its dividends in the 2020 assembly polls when the party won 75 seats. It is wrong that to link Lalu’s campaign as a decisive factor influencing the bypolls,” he says. JD(U) leader and water resources minister Sanjay Jha too echoed the same view. “People of the state have tasted development and reposed faith in the Nitish Kumar government. Younger generation voters do not identify with the RJD or Lalu Prasad, who had little impact on the polls,” Jha said. However, RJD’s state spokesperson Mritunjay Tiwary said Prasad’s presence was a big morale booster for the party’s rank and file.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-bypolls-jury-out-on-lalu-s-impact-101635872207489.html
02-11-2021||Patna||Bihar bypolls: Congress loses deposits on both seats, clamour of overhaul reignites||The humiliating defeat of Congress candidates in the bypolls for two assembly seats in Bihar, one of which it had lost only by a small margin in 2020 polls, has fuelled the demand for an immediate overhaul of the party in the state.Soon after the results became clear, former legislator and Congress leader of Mithilanchal, Rishi Mishra, said Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) chief Madan Mohan Jha must step down. “Those leading the campaign in the constituencies should also go,” he said.Snubbed by the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) for its demand to spare Kusheshwar Asthan seat for it, Congress walked out of the coalition and fielded Atirek Kumar, son of BPCC working president Ashok Kumar, from Kusheshwar Asthan and Rajesh Mishra from Tarapur. Atirek got less than 6,000 votes while Rajesh polled a little over 3,000. Both forfeited their deposits.All India Congress Committee (AICC) media panellist and MLC Prem Chandra Mishra said the party needed to start from the scratch and stay away from the coalition to revive its base in Bihar. “Congress has lost its vote base over the years. It’s a long-drawn process to rebuild credibility and win over people’s confidence,” he said the MLC, adding that there were many factors that worked adversely in the fray. “The result would have been different had the RJD not broken up the coalition,” he said.BPCC chief Jha said the party would review the reasons for defeat and take corrective steps to rebuild the organization.Some other senior leaders said AICC in-charge of Bihar, Bhakta Charan Das, needed to pay more time to resurrect the organization at the grassroots levels, instead of depending too much on leaders indulging in “political tourism”. “The likes of Kanhaiya Kumar, Jignesh Mevani and Hardik Patel will work in Bihar only if the party had an army of active and dedicated workers at village and panchayat levels,” said Kishore Kumar Jha.Das and chairman of the BPCC campaign committee and Rajya Sabha member Akhilesh Prasad Singh, could not be reached out for their comment.Former Patna University teacher and political analyst Nawal Kishore Chaudhary said the results were on the expected lines, as the Congress refused to undergo a massive overhaul. “With elections becoming individual-centric, Congress needs a dynamic and strong leader to counter the might of Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad. As of now, Congress remains a marginal force with nominal existence. Either it should undergo a complete overhaul or remain a pillion rider to the like-minded parties in Bihar,” said Chaudhary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-bypolls-congress-loses-deposits-on-both-seats-clamour-of-overhaul-reignites-101635872151218.html
02-11-2021||Other||Bihar bypolls: JD(U) retains both seats, Nitish thanks people||The ruling Janata Dal (United) in Bihar on Tuesday retained both the assembly seats where bypolls were held on October 30, nearly doubling its victory margin in Kusheshwar Asthan and winning Tarapur seat by a reduced margin as compared to 2020 state polls.The bypolls, necessitated by the death of sitting MLAs, had turned into a battle of prestige, with an ailing Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad campaigning in an election after a gap of six years. With Tuesday’s win, JD (U) now has 45 MLAs in the 243-member Bihar assembly. The ruling National Democratic Alliance, led by chief minister Nitish Kumar, now has the strength of 127 (BJP-74, JD(U)-45; HAM-S and VIP four each). Besides, it also has the support of one independent MLA, who is a minister. The opposition alliance has 110 members in the assembly — RJD (75), Congress (19) CPI-ML (12) and CPI and CPM two each. The remaining five are with AIMIM.In Kusheshwar Asthan, a constituency reserved for scheduled castes, JD(U)’s Aman Bhushan Hazari defeated his nearest rival Ganesh Bharti of RJD by 12,695 votes. Hazari polled 59,887 votes while Bharti managed to garner 47,192 votes. In 2020, the seat was won by Hazari’s father Shashi Bhushan Hazari, who passed away following an ailment in July this year. Congress, which had contested the seat in 2020 as part of RJD-led opposition alliance but lost by around 7,000 votes, had this time fielded Atirek Kumar after deciding to contest both seats following a fallout with ally RJD. Atirek, whose father Ashok Kumar had won the seat for the party multiples times in the past. finished fourth, with 5,603 votes, less than Lok Jan Shakti Party (Ram Vilas) candidate Anju Devi, who secured third place with 5,623 votes. Congress’s performance in Kusheshwar Asthan is contrary to the strong buzz it managed to create in its campaign in which it had fielded its new catch Kanhaiya Kumar, besides a host of senior leaders. In Tarapur, JD(U) candidate Rajeev Kumar Singh defeated Arun Kumar of RJD in a close contest, by a margin of 3,821 votes. The seat had fallen vacant after the death of sitting MLA Mewalal Chowdhary, who had to resign a day after becoming a minister following allegations of corruption levelled by the Opposition. Here too, Congress put a dismal performance.In his first reaction after the results were declared, RJD’s heir apparent and leader of opposition in assembly, Tejashwi Yadav, said, “We accept the people’s verdict. The sympathy factor worked in both the places. We gave a good fight in both the places and went to people with issues.” Chief minister Nitish Kumar, who is also the de facto leader of JD(U), said, “In democracy, people are the judge and they have given their verdict. I thank them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bihar-bypolls-jd-u-retains-both-seats-nitish-thanks-people-101635872149923.html
02-11-2021||Patna||Bihar bypolls: JD-U win redeems Nitish||The bypoll for the two assembly seats were never expected to change the complexion of the government in Bihar. And yet, they turned into high-stakes battles for prestige between the two regional powers – chief minister Nitish Kumar’s JD-U and Lalu Prasad’s RJD. JD-U comfortably retained Kusheshwar Asthan and humbled a spirited RJD in Tarapur, though with a slender margin.The only consolation for RJD was that despite loss, it showed its might as the only opposition in Bihar, while its estranged ally Congress bit the dust. For JD-U, the results have also come as a validation of Nitish Kumar. Party’s general secretary and minister Sanjay Jha, who camped in Kusheshwar Asthan for nearly a month, said after the results, “ We doubled our winning margin in Kusheshwar Asthan from 2020, which speaks a lot about the trust people have reposed in Nitish Kumar and his inclusive development politics, which has made women a decisive factor in elections.” In Tarapur, the contest turned out to be stiffer and JD-U had sensed it. Just before the polling, it had roped in veteran leader Shakuni Choudhary’s elder son Rohit Choudhary in the party. Rohit’s younger brother Samrat Choudhary is an MLC from BJP quota and minister in the Nitish cabinet. All the senior JD-U leaders campaigned in Tarapur. The position in the Assembly is such that the NDA government did not have much to worry, unless its two allies — HAM-S of former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi and VIP of Mukesh Sahni — decide to play truant, which seems more unlikely now. Both have four seats each but it would also require AIMIM’s five seats to give any realistic chance to the RJD. The equations remain unchanged even after bypoll and require too many ifs and buts to alter it. In the Assembly, the NDA has 125 seats (BJP-74, JD-U-43, HAM-S-4 and VIP-4) and support of an independent candidate, which will increase to 128 with the addition of two more seats to the JD-U kitty, while the Opposition tally stands at 110 (RJD-75, CPI-ML-12, CPI-2, CPM-2, Congress-19). AIMIM has five seats. The position of the House means that even smaller parties would not like to throw tantrums, BJP and JD-U remains just four short of the majority mark and there could be more inductions from disgruntled lot in opposition ranks. For the Congress, it is a rude shock, as it has proved that it would require to put in a lot of hard work for organsiational strengthening at the grassroots and mere enthusiastic outbursts would not serve.“Politics never stops, but Nitish Kumar has salvaged his position after the poor show last year.

Vigilance deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Arun Paswan said the circle officer of Bettiah (Sadar), Shyamakant Prasad, had demanded a sum of ₹2.5 lakh from one Vinod Gupta, a resident of Lauriya in West Champaran, in return for a favour in a land-related dispute. “The circle officer (CO) was caught with a sum of ₹2.5 lakh around 6.30 am today (Tuesday),” said the DSP.Meanwhile, a 10-member team led by deputy superintendent of police (DSP), Suresh Kumar Mahurwar, searched the CO’s residence in Kamalnath Nagar locality of Bettiah and recovered approximately 1kg gold and 3.2kg silver, besides ₹10.50 lakh in cash and some incriminating documents. “All other legal formalities are being fulfilled,” said DSP Mahurwar.Complainant Vinod Gupta had approached the bureau on October 29 and alleged that the CO was demanding a bribe in return for a favour after a dispute was raised by a woman Shakeela Khatoon.After verifying his complaint, a vigilance team laid a trap and caught the accused red-handed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bettiah-circle-officer-caught-taking-bribe-101635872147392.html
02-11-2021||Mumbai||Phase 1 of textile museum to be completed by February: BMC||Two years after Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) began work on creating a textile museum at the decrepit United Mills Compound 2 and 3, to showcase Mumbai’s erstwhile mill culture, work on its first phase will be completed by February next year, the civic body has said. The museum, spread over 16.3 acres of land, will document, archive and represent Mumbai’s textile legacy.Though phase 1 does not include the actual displays for the museum, it includes a tourist attraction of a three-dimensional multimedia water fountain, within the mill’s premises. Once completed in February, the civic body is likely to throw it open for the public, and host musical fountain shows.A senior civic body official from the heritage department said, “We mulled whether to open the museum for the public after the entire project was complete. But that is at least going to take three more years. Phase one will be completed in February, after which we will open it for the public. Ticket and pricing are yet to be decided.”BMC will simultaneously work on phase two of the project, which includes creating the museum displays, structural restoration of the entire building, plumbing, drainage, fire safety, among others. This is likely to take three more years, after which, the civic body will begin procuring items for museum displays.The musical fountain will cost the civic body ₹19 crore and an additional ₹3 crore for operation and maintenance for four years. The remaining phase one will cost ₹10 crore.Phase two is in the tendering process at present.BMC first started work on phase one of the project in 2019. It entailed a facelift for a small portion of the mill compound and the work was divided into two parts. Part one comprised upgrading the infrastructure of the area, restoring gates and grills and constructing a canteen. This part of the project is complete. Part two includes landscaping of the area, constructing an open-to-air amphitheatre, cleaning up the pond, and setting up a musical fountain. People can view the musical show from the amphitheatre.The official said, “Only installing the musical fountain is remaining now. All other aspects of our phase one are done.” It took two years to complete this phase, as the heritage department received permission from the tree authority to chop off 22 affected trees in December 2020.The 3-dimensional nozzles required for the musical fountain show will be procured from the international market. The contractor initially submitted a design to the civic body, and procured locally made nozzles. “These were not up to the mark. They were only giving us two-dimensional images. From market research, we learned the kind of nozzles we are looking for are not made in the Indian market. We don’t want to compromise with the grandeur of the project. Hence, it is taking longer,” the officer added. The contractor has located German, Chinese, and Korean nozzles, and will be procuring them within a month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/phase-1-of-textile-museum-to-be-completed-by-february-bmc-101635871547337.html
02-11-2021||Delhi||Festive Rush: Shoppers and cab drivers at odds||New Delhi Markets in Delhi-NCR are flooded with shoppers, who are thronging these places for crazy deals and gifts this festive season. And after feeling accomplished post a good session of bargaining, buyers emerge from these bustling markets only to face a nightmare to navigate through the crowds and get into the cab to reach home. Holding innumerable shopping bags, as soon as the denizens take to their phones to find their cabbies, the tussle thus begins. While the shoppers find it cumbersome to lug around their bags, cab drivers demand them to walk to out of the markets to be able to manoeuvre their vehicles easily. “After hours of festive shopping in Kamala Nagar, I booked a cab for home. Three drivers cancelled the cabs, I’m assuming due to the festival rush, and 15 minutes later one driver arrived. But less than half way into the trip, we found ourselves stuck in a massive traffic jam and the cabbie asked me and my sister to get off and refused to continue the trip even though this meant he would have had to pay a penalty out of his pocket,” says Princy Malhotra, a Delhi University student, who finally found another cab after 30 minutes of waiting on a jam packed road and could make it home only after 1.5 hours. “On a regular day, my home is just 30 minutes away from the market,” she adds.And the story is the same in the entire city, which has led to the residents and cab drivers being at loggerheads. Kritika Kaushik, a resident of Pitampura, shares that while shopping in Greater Kailash M block market with her mother-in-law, the cab driver “took his own sweet time to reach the pick up point”, after one driver had already declined to go to her pick-up location. “Coming back from GK M block market, a cab driver accepted our trip and demanded that we come outside to board the cab. We had shopped so much that it was difficult to carry all that stuff, but we didn’t have much choice. We asked him to wait for five to 10 minutes only to help him to not to get stuck in the traffic. But he didn’t want to wait, and started throwing tantrums. I didn’t take my car to avoid the parking stress, but this cab drama was too much to handle,” she recalls.Renu Mittal, a homemaker from Paschim Vihar, shares, “I wanted to go shopping in Sadar Bazar and took a cab but the driver refused to go any further as soon as he spotted the rush in the market. Of course, it was crowded, but how can he say from 1km afar, ‘Madam better hoga agar aap yahi utar jao aur walk kar lo market tak. Agar mujhe pata hota aapko yahan aana hai toh trip accept hi nahi karta!’ My friend and I had no choice then but to get off and walk. We took a cab for our convenience, but it was of no use. Then, on our way back home, we decided to take an auto rickshaw. That was a much better decision.”The cab drivers have their own set of woes, especially in the festive season when roads are jam-packed. Santosh, a cab driver rues that out of 10 trips, at least six are from or to a market. He says, “Women are either coming back after shopping or want to go to Karol Bagh or Lajpat or Chandni Chowk. And market mein leke jana ya wahan se nikalna koi mazaak nahi hai! People insist, ‘Bhaiya, market ke andar aao’ par aap batao itne rush mein kaise andar tak jayenge... isiliye cancel karna padta hai. Thoda toh unko bhi location se aage aana padega na!”Amit, who works as a driver-partner with a cab aggregator, opines, “Kitni baar ladai hoti hai isi baat pe. Par sabko lagta hai ki jo cab book kar raha hai wohi theek hai. Koi nahi sochta ki sometimes we have to take two-kilometre-long U-turns because people have issues crossing the road. And all this gets worse iss festival time pe. But humein toh apna kaam karna hai. People don’t understand our trouble driving through a bhari hui market. Riders often ask us to stop here and there during the trip so they can run errands, but when we have to refuel with CNG, tab sab nakhrae karte hain aur darate hain ki low ratings de denge.”“Is sab se toh achha hai ki tyoharon ke time pe outstation ki booking mil jaye,” says Sachin Gautam, another cab driver, and adds, “Market ki galiyon mein phas jaana kisko pasand hai! Vaise toh yahan 12 mahine rush rehta hai, but Diwali aur Bhai Dooj se pehle haalat aur kharab hoti hai.” Narrating an unpleasant experience, he shares, “Abhi ek ne cab book kari, and reaching inside the market obviously took me some time. Jab tak main struggle kar ke pahuncha, rider ne cancel karke dusri cab bula li. How unfair! Humare bare mein toh koi sochta hi nahi hai.”Author tweets @siddhijainnFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/festive-rush-shoppers-and-cab-drivers-at-odds-101635871190510.html
02-11-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai jabbed 99% of target but how many beneficiaries were from city?||Mumbai is inching closer to 100% Covid-19 vaccination coverage, with most people having received at least one dose. However, civic officials are puzzled over the accurate number of citizens from the city who have been actually vaccinated. Reason: A large number of people from the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) and other parts of the state have taken the jabs in Mumbai, thus, the number of doses administered may not mean the same as the number of Mumbai residents vaccinated. Mumbai’s estimated adult population eligible for vaccination is 9.2 million. As of Tuesday, the city had administered 9.1 million first doses, taking the vaccination coverage to 99%. The number of second doses administered in Mumbai stood at 5.6 million, and altogether, the city had administered 14.7 million doses, according to the CoWIN dashboard. The civic body estimates that about 10% of the doses administered in Mumbai were for people outside the city. “But 10% is also a very rough estimate,” additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani told HT. “Instead of getting into how many people from outside have taken the vaccine in the city, we have decided to focus on taking the vaccination coverage much beyond 100% to ensure that we cover all citizens,” he said. According to Kakani, the vaccination trend is the same as the one seen in active Covid-19 patients and the number of admissions in the city. “Many patients hospitalised in Mumbai are from out of the city,” he said, adding that Mumbai residents, too, have taken Covid-19 jabs outside the city. “Mumbai has a floating population and there is a lot of travel between Mumbai and its periphery as well as from other parts of the state,” said vaccination expert Dr Naveen Thacker. “The focus must therefore be on vaccinating as many people as possible, instead of singling out the number of people in the city who have got the doses. Evaluation of the coverage at a micro-level can be conducted after a few months, and strategies can be developed. But it is not essential at the moment,” he said. State strategizes for districts with < 50% coverage Ahead of the review meeting by Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi on Wednesday, the Maharashtra government has planned various strategies for districts with less than 50% vaccination coverage. The strategies include flexible timings for vaccination drives, a cluster-based approach focussing on groups of four to five villages at a time, increasing mobile vaccination drives, offering incentives such as fast queues at ration shops for vaccinated persons among others. Among the 40 districts with below 50% vaccination coverage in India, five are from Maharashtra. These include Akola, Buldhana, Nandurbar, Hingoli and Aurangabad. PM plans to interact with the district magistrates of all the 40 districts. The chief ministers of the states will also be present at the review. “We had a meeting with the five districts on Monday to discuss specific issues and plan ahead in order to improve the coverage,” said N Ramaswami, commissioner, National Health Mission. “There is a very minor gap for these districts to reach the 50% coverage. We found that vaccine hesitancy is not the main issue. There are other factors that have contributed to the low coverage. For instance, the floods in Aurangabad in August disturbed the vaccination drive. Also, the vaccination picked up late in these districts which is why they are slightly behind,” he said adding that the state has administered over 98 million doses so far, and the focus now will be on the districts lagging behind.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-jabbed-99-of-target-but-how-many-beneficiaries-were-from-city-101635871067661.html

As part of the efforts, the state government has already banned regular crackers in the state following orders of National Green Tribunal (NGT). The UPPCB has also served notices to over 90 industrial units found violating pollution norms in the state in October and put in place a robust mechanisms to identify places recording high air pollution.In the state capital, while UPPCB is monitoring air pollution data, Lucknow Municipal Corporation has deployed road water sprinklers and humidifiers to wet major roads during peak traffic hours. “All these methods have proved to be effective and we have managed to keep the AQI (Air Quality Index) in Lucknow below 300 mark. Will be continue these efforts and make them more effective in coming days,” said member secretary of UPPCB Ajay Sharma.Amidst these efforts, the AQI levels in UP cities reflected a slight increase on Tuesday. Ghaziabad, Hapur and Noida recorded AQI above 300 mark which is categorised as very poor as per data of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). Agra, Bulandshahar, Kanpur, Lucknow, Meerut and Moradabad recorded AQI in range of 201 to 300 which is considered poor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uppcb-asks-district-authorities-to-keep-tabs-on-air-pollution-during-festivities-101635870947537.html

02-11-2021||Mumbai||Corporators cry foul over water supply during Diwali||As the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections inch closer, corporators from across the party lines have complained of a shortage in the water supply. The corporators alleged that the water supply is being deliberately affected to ruin their image among the voters, ahead of the civic body elections.After an uproar over the issue, the standing committee meeting of the BMC was adjourned on Tuesday.The issue of water supply was raised by the Leader of Opposition and Congress corporator Ravi Raja, who also said that water department employees have been threatening to not work citing the transfer of an employee. Raja claimed that areas of Sion-Koliwada have been facing water shortage problems since October 16. “I was informed that the water issue would be resolved before Diwali, but nothing has happened so far. It appears that someone is deliberately tampering with the water supply in my area.”Along with Raja, corporators across party lines including Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), Samajwadi Party (SP), Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Shiv Sena have raised similar complaints.Education committee chairman and Sena corporator Sandhya Doshi said that many in Borivli have complained about not receiving a proper water supply. Doshi said, “Many locals of our ward have been questioning us about erratic water supply. Such a problem during the festival time will leave a major impact on the image we built in the past 4.5 years. People are bound to remember the problems they are facing now.”Rais Shaikh, SP group leader and corporator said, “I condemn the administration. If the leader of Opposition is not getting justice, how will other corporators get it?”Further, Rakhi Jadhav, NCP’s group leader in the BMC said, “The corporators are being troubled for water supply ahead of BMC elections in the coming months.”Corporators have claimed that as per the data on water stock shared by the hydraulic department, enough water is available. However, it is not being distributed properly, they said.BJP’s nominated corporator Bhalchandra Shirsat pointed out that while the corporators were raising the pressing issue, there were no concerned authorities from the hydraulic department to make note of the grievances and work on them.Meanwhile, additional municipal commissioner Sanjeev Kumar, who was present at the meeting, said that he did not have specific details about the water problem in the Congress corporator Ravi Raja’s ward. However, Kumar admitted that the water stock in lakes was sufficient.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/corporators-cry-foul-over-water-supply-during-diwali-101635870108509.html
02-11-2021||Mumbai||Why did PM Modi not wear a mask during G20 Summit: Shiv Sena||The Shiv Sena on Tuesday took potshots at Prime Minister Narendra Modi for not masking up during his visit to Rome, Italy, for the G20 Summit and while meeting the other heads of states. An editorial in party mouthpiece Saamana also mocked the PM for throwing a coin in Rome’s iconic Trevi fountain.The editorial said that because Modi did not wear a mask during his foreign visit, the pace of immunisation against Covid-19 in the country dropped.“Except Modi, all the leaders of the countries had worn masks during the G20 summit. Modi was the only one roaming in this manner. He did not wear a mask when he met [US President] Joe Biden and French President [Emmanuel Macron]. This has led to a lot of criticism, but for ‘bhakts [Modi followers]’ Modi is a superpower. So he is not afraid of germs and viruses. Modi has shown the world to live without masks,” the editorial said.On the sidelines of the summit, Modi and the other world leaders had visited the Trevi fountain on Sunday. The delegation also threw a coin from over their shoulder in the fountain. It is believed that on throwing a coin over the shoulder into fountain, a person returns to Rome.“Like Trevi fountain, there are many such fountains and spots in India. Even if this is superstition, Modi went there and put a coin in the water. What must he have wished for… All this is superstition but there are people who have blind faith in Modi in India,” the editorial remarked. As a policy, Maharashtra BJP does not respond to criticism or remarks in Saamana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/why-did-pm-modi-not-wear-a-mask-during-g20-summit-shiv-sena-101635869868210.html

02-11-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra to get 20 million Covid vaccine doses in Nov despite fall in demand||The Maharashtra government is likely to get more than 20 million Covid-19 doses from the Centre for the vaccination drive despite the lowering demand. The vaccine supply has been steady and its demand has gone down drastically from the past one month, mainly owing to two factors: the mandatory 84-day gap between two doses and the declining Covid-19 cases, thereby decreasing the need for the vaccine among beneficiaries. The state has about 7 million doses pending to be administered from the October stock. Dr Sachin Desai, state immunisation officer, said, “We are likely to get about 20 million doses of the vaccines this month and we have about 7 million already pending from the October stock. Last month, too, we had received over 20 million doses. As of now, the availability of vaccines is not at all the problem. We are supplying as much as vaccine that are being demanded by the districts. We are conducting massive information, education and communication (IEC) programmes to educate people the need to be fully vaccinated instead of just taking one dose. Even smaller districts are getting a smooth supply of the vaccine because we have distributed the stock to regional centres to decentralise the process.” Until October 31, the state has administered 98.17 million doses, of which a majority – 14.67 million doses – had been supplied to Mumbai, followed by Pune (12.10 million) and Thane (8.23 million). Maharashtra has been administering the highest number of doses among all the states in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-to-get-20-million-covid-vaccine-doses-in-nov-despite-fall-in-demand-101635867709488.html
02-11-2021||Mumbai||ED custody till November 6 for ex-minister Anil Deshmukh||A holiday court in Mumbai on Tuesday remanded former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh to Enforcement Directorate (ED) custody till November 6. The Central agency arrested the 72-year-old Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader at around 1 am on Tuesday in connection with a money-laundering case registered against him in May 2021.Shortly after conducting a medical examination at Sir JJ Hospital in south Mumbai, ED officials produced Deshmukh before a holiday court for remand. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh and Hiten Venegaonkar, who appeared for the agency, sought custody for 14 days.They submitted that a comprehensive money trail needs to be established to bring the guilty to book, and, since Deshmukh has emerged as the main beneficiary, he is required to be interrogated in custody. In its application seeking Deshmukh’s remand, the agency said a foreign angle cannot be ruled out.A money-laundering case against Deshmukh was registered on May 11 this year on the basis of the Central Bureau of Investigation’s First Information Report (FIR) of April 21. The CBI FIR was, in turn, based on allegations of corruption levelled by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh.In a letter written to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on March 20, Singh had alleged that Deshmukh had directed certain Mumbai police officers to collect an amount of ₹100 crore every month from Mumbai’s bars and restaurants.ED’s lawyers pointed out that the agency’s probe revealed that, on Deshmukh’s instructions, Sachin Vaze – an assistant police inspector in Mumbai – had called a meeting of bar owners, and that, between December 2020 and February 2021 collected ₹4.7 crore from the owners of so-called orchestra bars in Mumbai to avoid police interference. In his statement to ED, Vaze reportedly revealed that he handed over the “extorted money” in two instalments to Deshmukh’s aide Kundan Shinde.Subsequently, they said, Deshmukh’s son Hrishikesh received an amount of ₹4.18 crore routed through Delhi-based shell entities as donations to a Deshmukh-led charitable trust, Shri Sai Shikshan Sanstha, Nagpur.Deshmukh’s counsels, advocates Vikram Chaudhri and Aniket Nikam maintained that the NCP leader’s arrest was illegal. They pointed out that the original complainant Param Bir Singh himself had fled the country and is wanted in several extortion cases, and Sachin Vaze, on whose statement the agency was relying, is under arrest for equally serious offences. They added that Deshmukh was in no way related to the controversy and that the investigation itself was mala fide.While ED’s counsels maintained that Vaze had, in his statements to the agency, referred to the former home minister as “Number 1”, Deshmukh’s counsel claimed that it was a reference to Param Bir Singh, indicating that Vaze was extorting money for Singh, and not for Deshmukh.On June 26, ED had arrested Shinde and Deshmukh’s personal secretary Sanjeev Palande in the money laundering case, and on August 23, filed a charge sheet against them. Vaze is also an accused in the charge sheet.“In July 2021, ED has provisionally attached Deshmukh’s properties worth ₹4.2 crore, which included the NCP leader’s residential apartment at Worli in south Mumbai, valued at ₹ 1.54 Crore, and 25 land parcels of book value ₹2.67 crore, at Dhutum village in Raigad district,” an ED officer said.The properties were held in name Deshmukh’s wife Aarti and a company named Premier Port Links Pvt Ltd. ED officers said Deshmukh family had acquired 50% ownership in this company, including its assets i.e. land and shops valued at approximately ₹5.34 crore by paying just ₹17.95 lakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ed-custody-till-november-6-for-ex-minister-anil-deshmukh-101635867707292.html
02-11-2021||Delhi||#Dhanteras2021: Denizens pin their goals on Bollywood||Come Dhanteras, and jewellery buying turns into a full-fledged mission for Delhiites to buy what’s trending. And most look towards Bollywood for inspiration. “Ek ladki Sridevi ki photo leke aayi aur kaha jaisa unhone set pehna hai, waisa banana hai,” shares Pooja Wadhwa, a Delhi-based jeweller, adding that designs worn by actors Deepika Padukone, in Padmaavat (2018) and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan’s Jodha Akbar (2008) style were quite popular for years. And recently, she has noticed a lot of demand for the diamond and polki sets worn by actors Malaika Arora and Kareena Kapoor Khan. “Logon ki choice kaafi high-fi ho gayi hai. Aur festival ya wedding season mein toh customers naye design chahte hi hain,” Wadhwa adds. From stone work in gold jewellery to minimalistic designs, shoppers are enquiring about everything that’s catching their fancy. “Temple jewellery, diamond and polki seem to be the favourite for many,” shares Inderjeet Singh, a jewellery shop owner at Rajouri Garden, while Sanjay Goel, from a Gurugram-based jewellery store adds antique jewellery to the list of popular choices.Acknowledging the impact of social media on jewellery buying habits, Singh adds, “Silver and gold coins ki demand toh hai hi, par aaj kal social media par jo cheez chalti hai, bazaar mein uski charcha rehti hai! Bollywood is always a favourite for Dhanteras shopping. Jaise ek ladki ne Kareena ke earrings dikha ke kaha, ‘Isne jaise pehne huye hain, waise wale dikhana.” Actor Janhvi Kapoor seems to be the new inspo for the young shoppers. Actor Kangana Ranaut’s jewellery from the National Awards ceremony look is also popular for queries, shares Goel. Silver, too, doesn’t fail to impress. Santosh Bathija, a store owner from Khan Market, says, “Silver chokers.

They would be carrying a first aid kit to treat animals that are found injured in residential societies. Some that need hospitalisation would be admitted too.There are different groups from several residential societies that have joined hands for the same.Sukhda Shirke, a volunteer from Friends Group in Ambernath has decided not to burst fire crackers and at the same time take a walk in the night and morning to check whether all regular street animals are fine or not.Shirke said, “We nine mothers/friends have decided to educate our children about the safety of our environment and animals this Diwali. Although none celebrated a full-fledged Diwali last year, this year, instead of planning big, we have decided to keep it simple with our rituals and reduce harmful fun with firecrackers.” They had seen a cat that was injured due to a firecracker last Diwali and couldn’t save her. She said, “This year, we decided to change ourselves and make others aware of the same. Our children also got ready for the same and they suggested we take a round on the streets at night and in the morning. We have a number of animal doctors who can treat them on an immediate basis.”Members of PAWS, Nilesh Bhanage, in Thane said, “We have been creating awareness about different animals and birds that have suffered due to fire crackers. What we perceive loud is louder for the stray animals. Stray animals often get scared and injure themselves. This Diwali, we have pledged to save firecrackers’ money and help the animals or needy people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/vigilance-squad-formed-in-thane-kalyan-ambernath-to-protect-animals-from-fireworks-this-diwali-101635867408605.html
02-11-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Backed by 2 ruling parties, Congress wins Deglur bypoll||The Congress defeated the Bharatiya Janata Party candidate by 41,933 votes to retain the Deglur constituency bypolls in Nanded district, results of which were announced on Tuesday. The victory is considered important for the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) comprising three ruling parties – Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress – ahead of the local body elections and in the backdrop of the BJP’s vow of repeating the Pandhurpur bypoll episode when it had wrested the seat from the NCP in May this year. Congress’s Jitesh Antarpurkar, who polled 108,840 votes, won the bypoll by defeating BJP’s Subhash Sabne who polled 66,907 votes, while Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi’s Uttam Ingole got 11,348 votes. The victory will help the Congress to retain its number of 44 in the state Assembly. The bypoll was necessitated due to the demise of Congress’s sitting MLA Raosaheb Antapurkar in April this year. Congress picked Jitesh, son of Raosaheb Antapurkar, to get the benefit of sympathy due to the demise of the sitting MLA. BJP candidate Subhash Sabne, a three-term MLA, had defected from the Shiv Sena days before filing the nomination. The bypoll was a prestige fight for the ruling parties as well as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Key leaders, including Union and state ministers from both the sides, participated in the campaign for the bypoll held on October 30. Antapurkar maintained the lead for all 31 rounds since morning. His father had won the poll by 22,433 votes in October 2019. The constituency is reserved for a Scheduled Caste (SC) candidate. The BJP had said that it will repeat the results of Pandharpur bypoll held in May this year. The BJP had snatched the seat from the NCP as former’s Samadhan Autade bagged the seat by a narrow margin of less than 4,000 votes. It was considered a setback for the MVA government as the three parties had fought the poll together against the opposition BJP. The result of the bypoll in Deglur is also considered important ahead of the local body elections slated for early next year, as it indicates the mood of the people. More than 75% of the local bodies, including corporations and district councils, will go to polls. “It is a victory of the combined efforts put in by the three ruling parties. There have been constant efforts to destabilise and pull down the MVA government in the state by the BJP, but voters have voted against such attempts,” said Ashok Chavan, public works department minister and guardian minister of Nanded. According to the Congress leaders, the united efforts by three ruling parties helped them win the bypoll. “Although NCP chief Sharad Pawar and Sena chief and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray did not participate in the bypoll, they were in constant touch with Chavan. Thackeray held a video conference with ena leaders from Nanded. The leaders from three ruling parties knew that it will be a major embarrassment for them if they lost. Subhash Sabne’s defection to the BJP was a clever move by BJP leaders, but it got scuttled because of the defection of Bhaskar Khatgaonkar to Congress just days ahead of voting. Similarly, Ashok Chavan had ensured that a sizable government fund was spent in the constituency in the past six months,” said a Congress leader. Senior party leader and former union cabinet minister Ajay Maken, who was in Mumbai, on Tuesday said, “The results of bypolls across the country are a clear indication that the countdown of BJP has begun. People are not happy with the autocratic way of functioning of the BJP leadership at the Centre,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-backed-by-2-ruling-parties-congress-wins-deglur-bypoll-101635867046764.html

After the 2018 assembly elections, elections have been held in eight assembly seats in the state, out of which Congress has won six and lost two seats traditionally held by the NDA by a small margin,” Gehlot said.“This victory shows that people have full faith in the good governance and welfare policies of our government. In future too, we would be able to maintain public trust,” he added.Accepting the BJP’s defeat in the bypolls, state chief Satish Poonia said the results depended on "local equations".Meanwhile, state ministers congratulated the winners of the bypolls and hailed Gehlot’s government for the victories.Sports minister Ashok Chandana, who was among the leaders to have campaigned in Dhariawad, said the people have voted for the “good governance” of Gehlot. “The Congress candidates on both the seats are going to win the elections with huge margins, and this was expected," he had said earlier in the day.Minister Harish Chaudhary said, “Many congratulations and best wishes to Congress candidate Preeti Shaktawat ji and Nagaraj ji Meena for their victory in the by-elections for assembly constituencies of Vallabhnagar and Dhariyavad in Rajasthan. Thanks to the people of Vallabhnagar and Dhariyavad. The Congress government of Rajasthan will always live up to your belief firmly.”The Vallabnagar assembly constituency has been a Congress stronghold since 1952. The grand old party has won the seat nine out of 16 assembly elections till date. The Dhariawad seat, which became a constituency after delimitation in 2008, made a shift by voting for Congress. The BJP had won the previous two elections in 2013 and 2016, preceded by Congress in 2008.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-bypolls-shot-in-arm-for-gehlot-govt-as-congress-sweeps-in-vallabhnagar-and-dhariawad-101635861661836.html
02-11-2021||Mumbai||NEET: Day after results, some examinees claim getting 2 different ranks||A day after the National Testing Agency (NTA) announced results for the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET-UG), few students have raised an objection over receiving two different all-India ranks on the same scorecard. Many of them have sent their queries to NTA but are yet to receive a response.“On every scorecard, NTA has mentioned the all-India rank obtained— both overall rank and the rank for counselling — for every student. In my case, there two different ranks awarded to me are for the counselling process itself, which is confusing,” said a student on the condition of anonymity.Unlike other NEET examinees who have been given a separate rank for admission, this particular student has received two ranks for the same and is now unsure of which one to use during admissions. “I’m not the only one facing this trouble as many others have also taken to Twitter to share their problem. We have already written to NTA for clarity,” he added.This year, NTA released results without using the tie-breaker system—which means the top three students who scored 720 out of 720 shared the first rank, while the next rank given is directly the fourth one. Similarly, 12 candidates share the fifth rank as per this year. NTA, however, mentioned that a tie-breaking system will be used for admission purposes, wherein a student older in age will take the first rank, followed by those younger to him/her, and therefore shared a separate all-India rank to each student for admissions counselling purpose.“The rule to consider age of a student in case of a tie and give the higher rank to someone older has been mentioned by the ministry of health education, and while we wanted to mention overall ranks keeping this rule aside, for counselling purpose, we had to use tie-breaker and release results,” said a senior official from NTA. He added that students who have got errors in their scorecards should download the same from NTA website again and get in touch with the authority if the errors remain despite downloading the scorecard.“All students received a scorecard where percentile scores for each subject (physics, chemistry and biology) are mentioned along with the total score out of 720, total percentile score, and two separate ranks—one for overall rank and another for counselling. There are, however, a few students who have received two ranks for counselling only. Which one should they choose then?” asked Muzaffar Khan, a Thane-based medical education counsellor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/neet-day-after-results-some-examinees-claim-getting-2-different-ranks-101635865666659.html
02-11-2021||Jaipur||Congress scores a clear win on 2 Rajasthan seats, BJP gets a huge jolt||JAIPUR: Rajasthan’s ruling Congress won Vallabhnagar and Dhariawad assembly segments where bypolls were held on October 30, pushing its tally in the state assembly to 108 in the 200-member house.Tuesday’s election results have come as a huge shocker for the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which not only lost the Dhariawad seat that voted the party in the 2018 state elections but was not even in the reckoning to be the runners-up on either seat. The BJP candidate in Dhariawad came third; marginally better than Vallabhnagar where it ended up in the fourth position.Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot promptly interpreted the bye-elections outcome as a vote for his government and the Congress. Gehlot tweeted that people have given their stamp of approval to the policies, programs and good governance of the state government under the leadership of Congress President Sonia Gandhi.“Congratulations and best wishes to Preeti Shaktawat, and Nagaraj Meena, for their victory in the assembly by-elections. Gratitude to the voters of both the constituencies and congratulations to the workers and leaders of the Congress party,” he tweeted. Rajasthan Congress president Govind Singh Dotasara called the win on two seats as a “historic win”.“The competition in the Congress was which candidates will win with a larger margin of votes,” he said.The bypolls were necessitated due to the death of Congress MLA from Vallabhnagar Gajendra Singh Shaktawat and BJP MLA from Dhariawad Gautam Lal Meena.Congress candidate Preeti Shaktawat in Udaipur district’s Vallabhnagar defeated her nearest rival and Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP) candidate Udailal Dangi, by a margin of 20,606 votes. She received 65,713 votes.Udailal Dangi, a BJP rebel was originally the Rajasthan unit’s choice for the party ticket, but he didn’t get the ticket.A BJP leader said the party could have snatched Vallabhnagar from the Congress if the leadership stuck with Udailal Dangi.Independent candidate Randhir Singh Bhinder, who stood third with 43,817 votes, also has BJP links. Bhinder walked out of the party in 2013 after he was denied a ticket and later founded the Janta Sena. Binder won the seat on a BJP ticket in 2003, and a decade later, as an independent.Himmat Singh Jhala, the BJP’s choice for the party ticket, ended up with 21,433 votes.But the Vallabnagar assembly constituency has been a stronghold of Congress with the party winning nine of the 16 assembly elections held since 1952. Pratapgarg district’s Dhariawad assembly segment, which came into existence after the 2008 delimitation exercise, last voted the Congress in 2008. In 2013 and 2018, the seat voted for BJP candidates.Congress candidate Nagraj Meena defeated independent candidate Thawar Chand, a rebel candidate of the Bhartiya Tribal Party (BTP) with a margin of 18,725. BJP’s Khet Singh Meena came third, with 46,487 votes.A senior BJP leader said the party lost due to the selection of candidates. “The result indicates that we need to consolidate our votes and tickets should be given to those who are connected with the masses.” He reasoned that the late MLA’s son in Dhariawad, Kanhaiya Lal Meena, would have been a stronger contender since he has twice been a pradhan - now his wife holds the post - but was denied the ticket due to the policy that two people wouldn’t get the ticket.BJP state chief Satish Poonia said, “This defeat is natural; circumstantial and was dependent on local equations and issues. We need to move forward by keeping up our morale and confidence; avoiding criticism; and taking lessons. Even when we were in power, we moved ahead by taking lessons from the defeat in the by-elections.” Political analyst Manish Godha said the result suggests that there was no anti-incumbency against the state government and even if was there, it was overshadowed by the BJP’s factionalism and attempt to experiment. The result has come as a morale booster for the Gehlot government, especially since the BJP stood fourth and third on the two seats. He said inflation was an issue but the BJP lost because of its factionalism fielding new faces.“Instead of playing the sympathy card on the Dhariawad seat, they fielded Khet Singh, whereas in Vallabhnagar, candidates Bhindar or Dangi would have been better candidates… Another important factor was the absence of Vasundhara Raje from the campaign,” said Godha. Rajasthan Congress chief Dotasara said oppositions normally have an edge in bypolls due to the anti-incumbency factor. “When we were in the opposition (2013-18), the Congress won six of the eight bypolls held. In this government’s tenure, the Congress has won five of the seven assembly bypolls, and one each by RLP and BJP – this shows that anti-incumbency is there against Narendra Modi’s government,” he said, interpreting the outcome to imply that the Congress will get the public support in the 2023 state elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/congress-scores-a-clear-win-on-2-rajasthan-seats-bjp-gets-a-huge-jolt-101635865066583.html

02-11-2021||Patna||Bihar bypolls: Pashupati Paras say Lalu Prasad’s campaigning loss for RJD||Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) leader and Union minister Pashupati Kumar Paras on Tuesday said Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad’s campaigning for his party’s candidates in the bypolls led to their losses in Kusheshwar Asthan and Tarapur assembly seats.“The campaigning done by RJD chief Lalu Prasad in Kusheshwar Asthan and Tarapur assembly seats for by-polls in Bihar was a loss for their party rather than a gain,” Paras told news agency ANI.The ailing RJD supremo campaigned at Tarapur in Munger and Kusheshwar Asthan in Darbhanga towards the end of October after a hiatus of six years. He had returned to his home turf after about three-and-a-half years having served his jail term in the multi-crore fodder scam case and undergoing treatment in Delhi.Prasad’s appearance had drawn huge crowds to rallies where he hit out at Bihar chief minister and Janata Dal United (JDU) head Nitish Kumar and his ally Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).“People of Bihar had made Tejashwi the chief minister. But Nitish Kumar formed the government through cheating and manipulation. Had I been outside (jail), it would not have happened,” he had told a crowd at Idgah Maidan in Tarapur.“Now, I am back in Bihar and will continue to be among you people. We have to fight,” he added, while urging people to defeat the “double engine” government of Kumar.However, RJD candidate Arun Kumar Sah lost to JD(U)’s Rajiv Kumar Singh by a narrow margin of 4,000 votes. In Kusheshwar Asthan, the JD(U) won by a comfortable margin of more than 12,000 votes. Both seats were held by JD(U) leaders whose deaths had necessitated the by-election.The RJD had raised concerns of “rigged” elections in both the seats and deployed heavy artillery for vote counting. Leader of Opposition Tejashwi Yadav had objected to the posting of a police officer in Kusheshwar Asthan, following which the officer was taken off election duty by the commission.The party had also urged for postal ballots to be counted first, which the commission had agreed to, but added that counting of postal ballots will be done in a separate hall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-bypolls-pashupati-paras-say-lalu-prasad-s-campaigning-loss-for-rjd-101635864265322.html
02-11-2021||Lucknow||UP govt gave 4.5 lakh jobs since 2017, says Yogi||LUCKNOW Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday said that his government gave over 4.5 lakh jobs to youths through a transparent recruitment process in the last four and a half years of his regime. “Because of the honest, fair and transparent work culture, the state is progressing fast and is soon going to become the country’s biggest economy,” said Yogi addressing a gathering after distributing appointment letters to 33 newly appointed assistant engineers in the Housing and Urban Planning department.Adiyanath told the newly appointed engineers that their role should be to improve the image of their department and advised them to shun corruption. Speaking on development work, the CM said the Kanpur Metro will be inaugurated next month.“UP’s economy, which was on 6th position in the country for four and a half years, is India’s second-biggest economy today. If we work in the same pure and transparent manner, Uttar Pradesh will become the ‘Number One’ economy in the country soon,” he pointed out.Congratulating the newly recruited engineers, the CM said the BJP-led UP government gave more jobs in government and private sector in these four and a half years than in the last 15 years. “No one can point a finger at any of the appointments because these were made in a transparent manner. From appointment to selection, the government was monitoring the entire process,” he added.Taking a jibe at the previous governments, the CM said once upon a time the development authorities of the state had become centres of corruption. “Even passing a map of a house was a difficult task. The common man was very upset. We made a big difference by deploying good officers, organising special camps to solve the problem, fixing deadlines for the work. As a result, even the common man is saying that good work is being done by development authorities,” he said.Referring to his visit to Moradabad, he also gave information about the affordable housing project under construction there and said that such innovative efforts were the demand of today.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-govt-gave-4-5-lakh-jobs-since-2017-says-yogi-101635864466571.html

The Air Quality Index (AQI) of Bahadurgarh and Faridabad was 318 and 306, respectively. Whereas the AQI of Panipat, Gurugram, Rohtak, Kaithal, Hisar, Yamunanagar, Kurukshetra, Bhiwani, Charkhi-Dadri and Daruhera was between 200 and 300, respectively.According to the Central Pollution Control Board, an AQI between 0 to 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 to 100 ‘satisfactory’ and 101 to 200 ‘moderate’. The AQI between 201 to 300 is classified as ‘poor’ and 301 to 400 ‘very poor’ and above 400 is categorised as ‘severe’. Most of the Haryana cities have ‘very poor’ and ‘poor’ quality. ‘Very poor’ quality of air causes respiratory illness on prolonged exposure’ while ‘poor’ air quality causes breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure.The deteriorating air quality is a cause of concern as the officials monitoring air pollution predicted a strong possibility that it may further get worse by the end of this week. The air quality of most Haryana cities improved last week and on September 25, all 20 cities of the state witnessed an AQI below 100. The air quality, however, dropped again with the incidents of stubble burning. The number of stubble burning incidents reached 3,038 by November 1.With 775 incidents of farm fires, Kaithal district is at the top, followed by Karnal (740), Kurukshetra (459), Fatehabad (393), Ambala (186), Jind (183) and Yamunanagar (113).Concerned over the deteriorating air quality, chairperson of the Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas (CAQM) MM Kutty held a video conference with the deputy commissioners of the districts where the incidents of stubble burning were being reported. “During the virtual meeting, Mr Kutty asked why incidents of stubble burning were being reported in some districts every year,” said an official who attended the meeting, adding the chairperson has also emphasised the need to put a complete check on stubble burning and also took stock from the deputy commissioners about steps being over the air quality across NCR districts.With Karnal reporting 740 cases of farm fires this year, deputy commissioner Nishant Kumar Yadva claimed that there was a considerable fall in farm fires as the number has come down to 740 against 949 of last year. He said 70 FIRs have been registered against the erring farmers and a fine of over ₹10 lakh have been imposed on 397 farmers. In Kaithal, deputy commissioner Pradeep Dahiya said that a fine of ₹6.30 lakh has been imposed on 255 farmers while in Kurukshetra a fine of ₹4 lakh has been imposed on 254 farmers so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ahead-of-diwali-air-quality-deteriorates-in-most-haryana-cities-101635864347379.html

The guest faculty wants relaxation in recruitment process of 1,091 posts of regular assistant professors; the government has already issued a notification for this. “We want the government to issue separate orders that guest faculty will not be relieved after the recruitment process. We also want the government to exempt us from any kind of written examination,” said Harminder Singh Dimple, president, Guest Faculty Assistant Professors’ Association. On Tuesday, a delegation from the union also met Punjab higher education minister Pargat Singh and principal secretary Krishan Kumar. “The minister has assured us that there will be no threat to our jobs. We will, however, resume work only after the government issues written orders related to it,” Dimple added. There are 1,873 sanctioned posts of lecturers in Punjab, of which 1,292 are laying vacant, with just 581 regular lecturers on the job. To deal with the staff shortage, 882 guest faculty members and 251 part-time lecturers have been providing their services for the past 15 years.Deepak Kaushal, physical education assistant professor, said, “Many guest teachers are providing services at government colleges for years, but their jobs have not been regularised due to poor policies of the state government.”“Guest faculty members are working on a salary of ₹21,600 per month. Our jobs have not been regularised to date, due to bad policies of successive state governments,” he claimed, adding that guest faculty formed the backbone of government colleges in Punjab. “The sad part is that 50% of guest lecturers have crossed the age limit to apply for other government jobs. The government should ensure that their services are retained, even as regular lecturers are appointed,” he added. During his visit to Patiala on Monday, higher education minister Pargat Singh said the government will look into all aspects. “The demands of guest faculty will be taken into consideration before taking a final call on the issue,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/over-900-guest-faculty-across-punjab-start-indefinite-strike-for-job-security-101635863206940.html
02-11-2021||Mumbai||Start PG medical admissions to prevent burnout of current batches: Docs to GoI, CJI||The constant delay in conducting admissions to the first-year post graduate (PG) medical courses is not only creating trouble for those waiting to confirm seats, but also for those who are already pursuing the degree. In separate letters addressed to the Centre, the Chief Justice of India and the National Medical Commission (NMC), several groups of resident doctors have requested that National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET)-PG counselling be kicked off at the earliest. The letters have been written by the Federation of Resident Doctors Association (FORDA), Federation of All India Medical Association (FAIMA) as well as the Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD).“With no admissions to first-year PG batches, healthcare institutions are being managed by current second and third-year batches of resident doctors. This is precarious, considering that these two batches have been dealing with the pandemic since March 2020. We request the government as well as the Apex court to take notice of this matter and bring relief to thousands of resident doctors,” stated the letter signed by members of FORDA. Originally scheduled to take place in January, NEET-PG was postponed first to February, then April, and eventually delayed indefinitely owing to the rising cases of Covid-19 registered across the country. The entrance test was finally conducted in September, but admissions after the exam have been stayed by the Supreme Court, which is currently hearing a series of petitions filed by students, questioning the validity of the implementation of the economically backward class (EWS) and other backward class (OBC) reservations in the all-India quota (AIQ) seats. “Currently, the entire patient load is being managed by second and third-year PG resident doctors. We are lacking the entire first-year batch, which means 2,000 doctors for Maharashtra itself. Unless the authorities start PG counselling, the existing batches of resident doctors will face burnout,” said Dr Pranav Jadhav, vice-president, Central MARD.He added that even during the second wave of the pandemic between March and May, NMC had decided to delay the graduation of final-year resident doctors to have all the help needed. However, after the final-year batch graduated, no new batch has been admitted and the existing students are feeling the heat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/start-pg-medical-admissions-to-prevent-burnout-of-current-batches-docs-to-goi-cji-101635862726527.html

02-11-2021||Mumbai||Presidential assent for amendment to Mhada Act for cessed buildings in process: Centre to HC||The Bombay high court (HC) has asked the Union government to inform it of the status of the President assent to a bill passed by the Maharashtra government enabling it to take over pending projects under the Mumbai Building Repairs and Reconstruction Board (MBRRB) of the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (Mhada). The directions were issued after petitioners of cessed buildings who are affected by projects pending since 2017, approached the HC seeking directions to the state to take over the projects as the developers had abandoned them. On its part, the state government informed the bench that it had amended the relevant section of the Mhada Act, which would enable it to take over such projects and complete them at its own cost soon after the President assent was granted and the bill became effective. A division bench of justice Ujjal Bhuyan and justice Madhav Jamdar, while hearing the petition of Navin Gupta, was informed by advocates JM D’Silva and VN Gupta that the petitioner was living in a cessed building- repairs and reconstruction of which came under the purview of the MBRRB. The advocates added that the contractor/developer had defaulted in completing the project as a result of which the petitioner and many others like him living in cessed buildings were left without a roof on their head. In light of these submissions, the advocates sought directions from the state to acquire the projects and ensure their completion. While responding to the grievance of the petitioner, additional government pleader Hemant Haryan submitted that the state government had amended the Mhada Act to insert section 91-A which would enable the state government to acquire the projects and complete them. Haryan submitted that the amendment had been passed by both the houses of the state legislature and was now awaiting the assent of the President. Last September, the state legislature had passed an amendment allowing the Mhada to redevelop or repair dilapidated and cessed buildings to protect the interest of the occupants of such structures. Both the Houses of the legislature had passed an amendment in the Mhada Act, 1976, empowering the authority to take over the cessed buildings, with the consent of 51% occupants, if the owners and housing societies failed to redevelop them within a year of the notification. Haryan had further submitted that the state could not proceed in the absence of such assent, therefore views from the Central government may be obtained. While responding to the direction of the bench to place their view on the issue of the assent of the President, additional solicitor general Anil Singh informed the bench of the status of the bill and also informed that the process for obtaining the assent of the President was underway. The court accepted the report by the ASG and placed the petition for hearing on November 29. Numerous petitions have been filed in HC by occupants of cessed buildings in the city especially in the south and central Mumbai after the developer/contractor defaulted or abandoned the project which was entrusted to them by the MBRRB. As some of these buildings are in an extremely dilapidated condition but as the Mhada Act did not permit the state government to acquire the projects the petitioners have approached the HC seeking relief. The nod from the President will ensure that the buildings are either repaired or redeveloped by the state to ensure that there is no loss of life or property to occupants in case of any collapse similar to the building in Malwani which collapsed and killed 12 people including eight children.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/presidential-assent-for-amendment-to-mhada-act-for-cessed-buildings-in-process-centre-to-hc-101635861106145.html
02-11-2021||Chandigarh||Himachal bypoll: Jai Ram accepts defeat, says will work on BJP’s shortcomings before 2022||After the electoral drubbing in three assembly constituencies and one parliamentary seat in Himachal, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur, under whom the Bharatiya Janata Party fought the bypolls, accepted the outcome and took responsibility for the defeat. “I accept the people’s verdict in Mandi, Arki, Fatehpur and Jubbal-Kotkhai and congratulate the Congress candidates who have won. Our party will deliberate on the reasons for the defeat and chalk out the future strategy accordingly,” he said adding that the party will look at working on the shortcomings before the assembly elections slated for 2022.He also vindicated reports of election sabotage and attributed Congress’ victory to the sympathy factor post former chief minister Virbhadra Singh’s demise and the rebellion within the saffron party. “Sympathy factor for the Congress was apparent in the tribal regions and the party seems to have taken full advantage of that,” said Jai Ram.Following the debacle, the CM cancelled his planned visit to Mandi. Deep Kamal, the party office in Shimla, where supporters had planned for big celebrations in anticipation of a thumping victory, went into a lull after the declaration of results. Jai Ram said the party would work with a renewed zeal for the assembly elections in 2022. “Congress has won Mandi but it’s not a victory that the party should celebrate, the margin was very less. Price rise was an issue and Congress exploited it to the hilt,” he said. It’s a referendum against BJP, says Congress Buoyed by the victory, the Congress said results show people have lost confidence in the ruling party. State Congress president Kuldeep Singh Rathore said, “The chief minister has lost the confidence of the people of Himachal Pradesh. The results of this byelection are a referendum against the ruling BJP government. Jai Ram Thakur should resign on moral grounds.”Thanking the voters of the state, the Congress chief said, “In constituencies where the BJP previously had a lead of more than 30,000 votes, it has now been reduced to less than 1,500.” He said the Congress’ lead in postal ballots was a clear indication of a strong anti-government sentiment among government employees.Meanwhile, Pratibha Singh who trounced BJP’s Brig Khushal Singh Thakur (retd) in the Mandi Parliamentary seat, said, “People have voted for the developmental works carried out by Congress government. Modiji promised two crore jobs but in the last seven years, he has done nothing in this regard. This victory is a tribute to my late husband, Raja Sahab, who was seen as the architect of modern Himachal Pradesh.”She thanked party workers who worked tirelessly to ensure the victory of candidates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/himachal-bypoll-jai-ram-accepts-defeat-says-will-work-on-bjp-s-shortcomings-before-2022-101635860986299.html

According to commission secretary VV Palnitkar, the home department has that one room would be made available at a Sahyadri guesthouse. “I am awaiting directions from the chairman. We have demanded two rooms - one cabin for commission members and one for the office. I have not seen the room. We will respond after the directions of the chairman,” said Palnitkar. The judicial commission probing the violence near Maharashtra’s Bhima Koregaon village in 2018 suspended its scheduled hearings on Monday, saying the state government was yet to provide suitable accommodation in Mumbai despite several requests. In a letter to the state government, Palnitkar said that despite repeated letters, “nothing was heard from the government till October 31, 2021 about availability of suitable accommodation”. He added, therefore, there was no other option but to suspend the hearing schedule till the government provided accommodation. “Accordingly, the commission hereby suspends all future hearings till the Government provides suitable accommodation at Mumbai,” said the letter, a copy of which is with HT. The letter said the commission informed the government it had to postpone the hearings scheduled in March and April 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic and restrictions imposed to avoid crowding. “In its seventh status report, the commission has stated that it is likely to examine about 40 more witnesses and expects a further extension of at least six months.” The two-member commission, headed by retired high court justice J N Patel, was constituted by the state government in February 2018 to probe the sequence of events that led to violence on the 200th anniversary of the battle of Bhima Koregaon on January 1, 2018. The violence left one person dead and several injured. “In the meeting dated October 28, chairman of the commission, justice J N Patel, advised principal secretary, Home, to take up the issue directly with the chief minister’s office and to get suitable accommodation on an emergent basis. It was also made clear that if suitable accommodation is not provided by October 29, 2021, the commission would suspend its hearing schedules,” the letter added. The probe panel resumed hearing in the case in August this year after a gap of nearly 14 months in the wake of Covid-19 restrictions||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/home-dept-offers-room-to-bhima-koregaon-panel-at-sahyadri-guest-house-101635860629973.html

While the JD(U) candidate from Kusheshwar Asthan was able to win the seat with a comfortable margin, the Tarapur Assembly constituency witnessed a seesaw contest between JD(U) and the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), the principal Opposition in Bihar Legislative Assembly.JD(U) had fielded Aman Bhushan Hajari from Kusheshwar Asthan after the seat fell vacant following the demise of his father, Shashi Bhushan Hajari. JD(U) was able to retain the Kusheshwar Asthan assembly constituency with over a 12,695 vote margin against rival RJD's Ganesh Bharti. JD(U)'s vote share in Kusheshwar Asthan is 45.72%, while RJD's vote share stands at 36.02%. Congress ended at 4th position with 5,602 votes and a dismal 4.28% vote share.In Tarapur, the RJD gave a scare to JD(U) as it led the trends up to 18 rounds of counting, only to give back a decisive lead after 24 rounds. JD(U)'s Rajeev Kumar Singh won the Tarapur Assembly seat by 3,852 votes over his nearest rival Arun Kumar, who was fighting from RJD's ticket. JD(U) received 46.62% of the total votes polled while RJD got 44.35% vote share. Congress performance in Tarapur was worse than Kusheshwar Asthan as it was able to receive just 2.12% of the total votes polled, 0.70% more vote share than NOTA.The overall vote share of JD(U) and RJD in the bypolls stands at 46.22% and 40.72% respectively. Congress' overall vote share (3.06%) is less than that of the Lok Jan Shakti Party (Ram Vilas) which received 3.65% of the total votes polled in the Bihar by-elections.RJD supremo Lalu Prasad's return to the poll campaign after years was seen as a huge boost for the party, which prompted the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) to run an intense campaign. Nitish Kumar, state ministers and other alliance leaders held several public meetings in Kusheshwar Asthan as well as Tarapur Assembly constituency to retain the seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-by-election-boost-for-nitish-kumar-s-jd-u-as-rjd-fails-to-snatch-tarapur-in-close-fight-101635856943237.html
02-11-2021||Chandigarh||Travel diaries: A therapy, meditation like no other||Whenever I travel, I take along two of my diaries. Favourite companions, they occupy a prime place on the bookshelf. Despite one of them having run out of blank pages, I still make it travel, which of course holds a richer travel history than the second one. During the lockdown months, I often turned to them as they made me travel again and ever since it’s become a ritual to read them every few weeks, especially at bedtime. I may have frequently dived into their deep waters but I’ve never been bored, rather with every session, my fascination soars. A warm thank you to them, which have chronicled so much – my conversations, museum visits, itineraries, flights, travel column ideas – some got published, some rejected and most importantly many lessons and epiphanies, most of which struck me during leisurely walks or while I’d be glued to the window during road or air journeys. Some of the pages make me nostalgic, some make me laugh and some allow me to hold conversations with locals I’ve met. Their emails and social media IDs, scribbled by them, sit on many of the pages, and I’m glad that I’m in touch with most of them. When I find coffee marks somewhere, I begin to wonder if they are from some flight or a café. There are pages where I get stuck and don’t feel like going further, chiefly which carry any flight notes, and I admire the details, from plane type, the airline, the meals and drinks served, the seat number, the views, my co-passengers, followed by first impressions of places I arrived at. One of them, from my first flight to Christchurch on April 1, 2019, reads: “Loving the views of Sydney’s skyline from my seat 5F (Qantas QF 139: Boeing 737) during the push back and enjoying the soothing welcome music along.” With skyscrapers drawn next to these words, the note continues: “During nearly 3-hour flight over the Tasman Sea, my eyes are being treated to the best sunset views, holding a cup of coffee in hand.” I also land on pages that hold stories of unique tours, from the Boeing factory in Seattle to a graveyard tour in a small town of Washington. It’s a joy to be led by those guides again, and get regaled by their commentary. The cycling experience around 4am along Lake Michigan in Chicago and walking up to the zenith of a hill in New Zealand’s Queenstown, where views of the lake and the Alps left me in awe; are some of my favourites. Sitting there, I wrote profusely, including epiphanies on life that crossed my mind. The diary is proof. These epiphanies act as a lighthouse for me, like the many beautiful adages I peppered my diaries with, the moment I caught them somewhere. The most inspiring one was while I was at Cape Byron Lighthouse in Australia. Its door had this on display: “Can we be the lighthouse for the world or someone?” Within a New York minute, my pen printed it on my diary. As I used one of these diaries for my interview with actor Manisha Koirala at the Khushwant Singh Literature Festival a few years ago in Kasauli, there are also pages that make me talk to her whenever I want. With many answers on how her mindset changed post cancer, there’s tons of inspiration for anyone who reads them. My diaries are therapy for me, a meditation like no other and a big chunk of me, which always makes me count my blessings and how travel has enriched me. Someone has rightly said, “We travel not to escape life but for life not to escape us.” If St Augustine is to be believed, “The world is a book and those who do not travel, read just a page.” rameshinder.sandhu@gmail.com The writer is an Amritsar-based freelance contributor||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/travel-diaries-a-therapy-meditation-like-no-other-101635859486198.html
02-11-2021||Chandigarh||Capt Amarinder quits Congress, accuses Sonia of midnight conspiracy||Former chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Tuesday resigned from the Congress and announced the formation of his new party, Punjab Lok Congress. In a seven-page resignation letter to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, the two-time former chief minister said the midnight conspiracy carried out against him at her and her children’s behest by calling a Congress Legislature Party (CLP) meeting over his head at the dead of the night and that too through Twitter was the most “egregious” act. “It was my prerogative as the CLP leader to have called the meeting if the AICC desired it. It was only early next morning that a colleague informed me that such an outrageous act has been committed,” he wrote. Also read: Jakhar has Capt Saab twist to Channi govt’s no ad on Indira Gandhi’s death annivCapt Amarinder Singh said he felt deeply hurt by her conduct and that of her children who he still loved as much as his own children, having known their father, since they were in school together in 1954. “…I hope that no other senior Congressperson is subjected to the ignominy that I was put through,” he wrote, listing in detail his achievements, particularly his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. Concerned about state in inexperienced hands Capt Amarinder Singh was made to resign as the Punjab chief minister on September 18 after a bitter tussle with Navjot Singh Sidhu amid infighting in the state Congress. The party later picked Charanjit Singh Channi as the next chief minister of the state. The former CM wrote that he was quite concerned about the inexperienced hands in which the state was given. “It is beyond my comprehension as how these inexperienced hands will handle the security situation in view of the massive influx of weapons and explosives and narcotics. We are gravely threatened by narco-terrorism that our hostile neighbour is sponsoring against us,” he said. Formal launch of party, symbol later On his new party, Capt Amarinder Singh said the registration of the party was pending approval with the Election Commission of India. “Since I announced that I will be forming my own party, my team of lawyers is working on the process and had applied to the Election Commission of India for the registration,” he said. He said the Election Commission had no objection to the proposed name, Punjab Lok Congress. About the party symbol, he said the EC had given three symbols from which one was to be chosen. “We have submitted three symbols and the final one will be chosen from the set of six, three suggested by the EC and three proposed by the party,” he said, adding, “The party will be formally launched later and its policies, programmes, agenda and vision will be spelt out at the time of the launch.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/capt-amarinder-quits-congress-accuses-sonia-of-midnight-conspiracy-101635856725717.html
02-11-2021||Chandigarh||Freshly infiltrated groups behind terror spike in Rajouri-Poonch||While the Army lost nine soldiers, including two junior commissioned officers, within four days in October, the protracted Poonch encounter in the dense jungles of Nar Khas entered the 23rd day on Tuesday. Former DGP SP Vaid, the man who contained Pak-sponsored terrorism during its peak, attributed the spike in terror activities in the twin border districts of Rajouri and Poonch, south of Pir Panjal, to freshly infiltrated terrorists. “Most likely, they are infiltrating groups. It (spike in terror attacks in Rajouri-Poonch) doesn’t appear to be a spillover from South Kashmir because not many terrorists are left in the Valley now. In the last two years, several terrorists have been eliminated in Kashmir and their numbers have been constantly depleting. Spillover takes place when their numbers go up considerably and their masters, sitting across the border, intend to engage security forces and involve Jammu,” said the former DGP. ‘Focus back on Kashmir after fall of Afghan govt’ Vaid said that after Afghanistan’s capture by the Taliban, Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) seems to have shifted its focus back on Kashmir. “Most probably, the ISI is trying to get terrorists spared from Afghanistan, and take them to launch pads along the Line of Control (LoC) to infiltrate them from Rajouri, Poonch, Uri, Tangdhar and Gurez,” the former DGP said. He said the ISI always tries to involve Rajouri, Poonch, Doda and Kishtwar areas. “Rajouri and Poonch have remained preferred routes for infiltration as they get less snow and the terrain is easier than Kashmir. People in this region are overwhelmingly nationalist and against terrorism but Hurriyat and JeI have tried to radicalise them in the past,” he said.No spillover from Valley: ArmySources within the army establishment, however, said, “As of now, there are no clear cut answers on why there is a spike in terrorism south of Pir Panjal.” “Infiltration pattern does not indicate exponential increase. Two to three militants from south Kashmir were able to sneak into the region, probably via Pir Ki Gali, but there is no big spillover from south Kashmir,” they added. The source said that though nine soldiers have died in two encounters, calling the region a hotspot of terror may not be correct at this stage. According to DGP Dilbag Singh, five to seven militants are believed to be hiding in the forests between Surankote and Mendhar tehsils of Poonch. “Two groups had come from across the LoC through Rajouri-Poonch area and they are embedded somewhere in the jungle. Going by their sighting at three places and the crossfire between them and us at two places, it seems their number is between five and seven,” he told a TV channel in Srinagar recently. On August 10, Dilbag Singh had said, “After a brief lull following the renewed truce deal between the two DGMOs on February 25, infiltration into Jammu and Kashmir resumed.” He added, “Terror camps across the border are still intact.” Route taken by infiltrators An intelligence official, requesting anonymity, said, “Sangiot and Balakote in Mendhar is an infiltration route. Once in, the terrorists cross Bhimber Gali and enter Nar Khas and Bhata Dhurian forests from where they can go to Thannamandi or to Bufliaz to Pir Ki Gali and head towards Shopian.” “It seems to that the fresh infiltration has caused disturbance in Rajouri and Poonch,” he added. “Till May, there was no infiltration in the region but we also know that during the season of maize crop and before the onset of winters, terrorists try to use these routes to infiltrate,” he said. The first major encounter took place in the region on August 6, a day after the second anniversary of the abrogation of Article 370, when two terrorists were killed in the Pangai forest of Thanamandi area of Rajouri. Another encounter took place in the same area on August 19. Two soldiers, including a JCO, were killed in an encounter. On September 13, a terrorist was killed in Manjakote area of Rajouri. “These encounters suggest that the terrorists had successfully infiltrated from across the LoC,” he said. Tufail Hussain, 36, a farmer from Shahpur, a village along the LoC in Poonch, said, “We have been living a peaceful life following a renewed truce deal on February 25 but things, it seems, have started taking an ugly turn. I don’t know whether they are coming from South Kashmir or have crossed the LoC but we are really scared.” “We request Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take strong action against terrorism,” he added. Munaf Malik, former Hizbul Mujahideen commander, said, “Militancy has increased and the situation is deteriorating in the region. There could be multiple factors behind this, but I believe that resentment has increased among the people because of the rising unemployment.

02-11-2021||Pune||Civic Sanskriti: Hope from the extraordinary power of ordinary people||PUNE A declaration was made on Day 1 of COP26, the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference. What is extraordinary is that the declaration is from a set of ordinary human beings, members of the first Global Citizens’ Assembly. They were joined by Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister of Scotland and Vanessa Nakate, youth activist from Africa.As shared in the column in September, the Global Citizens’ Assembly for COP26 is composed of one hundred people who together are an accurate snapshot of the world’s population by gender, age, geography, education, and attitude to climate change. The Assembly members were selected by a global lottery, meaning that anyone on earth could have been chosen.Global assembly processThe Global assembly members deliberated through October 2021, in over 30 languages, each supported by a community host with online conferencing facilities.They shared their lived experiences of climate change, gaining knowledge about climate change and the global COP processes. They shared views and hopes for how humanity should address the climate and ecological crises we face. They prepared the declaration by deliberating and voting on each sentence, giving reasons for their choice.People’s DeclarationThe ‘People’s Declaration for the Sustainable Future of Planet Earth’ presented by the Global Assembly to world leaders at the COP26 climate conference, says ecocide should be “firmly enforced alongside existing environmental protection laws”.The assembly defines ecocide as: “Unlawful or wanton acts committed with knowledge that there is a substantial likelihood of severe and either widespread or long-term damage to the environment being caused by those acts.” It could make some governments, corporations, and individuals guilty of an international crime!The Global Assembly resolved to endorse the Paris agreement, which aims to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The assembly resolved that: “The (Paris) agreement has to be strictly enforced and monitored by the United Nations, in collaboration with the relevant actors at all levels of governance.”But the assembly says mitigation should be equitable. “Developed countries should assist developing countries in building up autonomous capabilities for climate action, particularly in financial and technological terms,” the declaration says.The declaration presented by the assembly members on November 1 is specifically for COP26. The Assembly’s final statement, to be published in March 2022, will contain a broader set of statements providing a full response to the framing question: how can humanity address the climate and ecological crisis fairly and effectively?Support for Global AssemblyThe UN secretary general António Guterres and COP26 president Alok Sharma have made statements supporting the Global Assembly. “The Global Citizens’ Assembly for COP26 is a practical way of showing how we can accelerate action through solidarity and people power,”said Guterres.COP26 is branded as “an inclusive COP” after the Covid-19 restrictions. The Global Assembly process shows one of the best examples of inclusion of ordinary people. It also reflects the principles of action for climate empowerment, an integral element of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and Paris agreement.ExpectationThe citizens’ proposals are ambitious, and politicians may find the ambition hard to meet, constrained as they are by traditional politics. But citizens’ assemblies around the world are putting forth proposals that are practical and commensurate with the challenge.Rich Wilson, co-founder of the Global Assembly, speaking to BBC News on the eve of COP26, said, “Success would be if government leaders match and meet the citizens’ proposals. The expectation is that the world leaders would enter into dialogue with the citizens’ assembly, acknowledging citizens as key actors in the future of managing climate and in global governance on an ongoing basis.”FutureThe Global Assembly will become a new piece of international governance infrastructure, sitting alongside the UN, the World Trade Organisation (WTO) , and others as a place for citizens to have a direct place in decision making.Global Assembly member Mulki Devi, from Katihar, Bihar, shared that, “We have been facing crop losses in recent years due to climate change. As a member of the Global Assembly, I learned a lot about climate change. Now I want to form a women’s group in my village so we can understand more and work together.”Kunal Jaiswal, cluster coordinator for the eighteen assembly members and community hosts in India, said, “The co-creation process of the Global Assembly is equitable, flexible and inclusive. I am hopeful that it will help us all to work and move together to clarify and achieve our common goals.”The one hundred people who are the members of the first assembly on climate change are not permanent members. Other ordinary people, again selected by lottery, would convene as a Global Assembly in the future on other global issues. The number of members may even go up to one thousand.The Global Assembly is about ordinary people having a say in global decision-making. National climate assemblies and community assemblies can help take these processes much closer to people. India’s rural areas have their Gram Sabha, which is already an inclusive decision-making structure that people can and should use for climate empowerment.With such mechanisms, everyone on earth has a chance to have a say – because they are a human being. As Rich Wilson says, “It’s about time that citizens were invited to the table.”Read the Global Assembly declaration and get guidance to run your community assembly at globalassembly.orgSanskriti Menon is senior programme director, Centre for Environment Education.

Who were organisers of the parties? Such parties continued until you were the chief minister and discontinued after the government changed [in 2019]. Were you not aware of these parties? Was your police machinery so weak?”Malik added Fandavis, who was also the home minister then, should have taken action against such parties. “I had cautioned when you (Fadnavis) completed one year in office... about your brother. I questioned what was a duplicate Devendra Fadnavis doing in the city. Had CCTV footage of hotels been released, it would have been difficult for some people to hide their faces at that time. I have never done vendetta politics.”Also Read: We were being trapped: Sameer Wankhede refutes Malik’s latest allegationsThe comments came a day after Malik on Monday tweeted pictures of Fadnavis and his wife, Amruta, with Jaydeep Rana who was arrested in a drug peddling case. Malik alleged that drug peddlers were protected under the previous Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Maharashtra.Fadnavis denied the allegations on Monday and said he will expose Malik’s links with “the underworld” after Diwali.Malik on Monday dared Fadnavis to expose the links. “In 62 years of my life, no one has ever dared to say that I am linked to the underworld. Everyone knows that I was the only person targeting and questioning Devendra when he was the chief minister. Despite being targeted, you (Fadnavis) chose to keep quiet. Why? If you were aware of any such links, it was your responsibility to take action against me. By making vague allegations, I will not stop.”Malik claimed a consignment of 51 tonnes of poppy seeds has been lying at Jawaharlal Nehru Port near Mumbai for over five days and the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence was yet to register a case. He questioned why action has not been taken so far.He reiterated his allegation that the drug business was going on under political protection. “A dangerous game is going on related to drugs... The entire game of drugs cannot be run without political protection... those responsible for eliminating drug cartels are found allowing drug businesses to run.”BJP leader Ashish Shelar dismissed Malik’s allegations as baseless. He added he has levelled them out of fear of getting exposed after Diwali. “Why did Malik hide the sensitive information related to the drug cartel he had. Is it not a violation of the oath he has taken as a minister?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/nawab-malik-targets-devendra-fadnavis-again-links-him-to-high-end-parties-101635849394684.html

Nagraj Meena was leading by a margin of 20,252 votes over Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate Khet Singh Meena in Dhariawad. In Vallabhnagar, Preeti Shaktawat was ahead of Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP) candidate Udailal Dangi by a margin of 8,088 votes. The Vallabnagar assembly constituency has been a Congress stronghold with the party winning nine out of 16 assembly elections since 1952. The BJP candidate Randhir Singh Bhindar managed to win in 2003, and later as an independent in 2013. Dhariawad, which became a constituency after delimitation in 2008, has witnessed three assembly polls, with the BJP having won twice, in 2013 and 2018, and the Congress in 2008. Tranpsort minister Pratap Singh Khachariywas said, “We thank the people for supporting the policies of the Ashok Gehlot-led government. The win will show that Gehlot’s policies are… [endorsed] by the people.” Sports minister Ashok Chandana, who was among the leaders who campaigned in Dhariawad, said the people have voted for the “good governance” of Gehlot. “The Congress candidates on both the seats are going to win the elections with huge margins, and this was expected,” he said. BJP state president Satish Poonia said local equations didn’t go in the party’s favour and the trends were unexpected. “The BJP suffered because of the division of votes in both the constituencies,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-bye-elections-congress-candidates-lead-in-dhariawad-vallabhnagar-101635845195734.html

In May, the test positivity rate was over 10%. The test positivity rate on Monday was 0.94%. Authorities said the fewer cases on Mondays are because lesser people are tested over weekends.Kedar Toraskar, a member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 Task Force, said, “It is surprising that we are seeing a decline in cases despite people not adhering to Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. I think cases are declining due to vaccinations and herd immunity.”State surveillance officer Pradeep Awate said, “We never had so few figures in the past one and a half years. I agree it is Monday and figures are low, but it has never been so low. Our entire effort of ramping up tests, isolating the patients as well as mass vaccinations have given us good results.”Mumbai reported 258 cases and four deaths on Monday. The number of active patients in Maharashtra is 15,552. The toll from the pandemic has reached 140,226.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday said the third wave may or may not come as there is no new deadly variant in the state.

02-11-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: Railway underbridge in Pakhowal turns into cesspool||The under-construction railway underbridge (RUB) on Pakhowal Road crossing — from Pakhowal canal bridge towards Sarabha Nagar — has turned into a pool of waste water after a chamber of the main sewer line (72 inches wide) got damaged during the construction process. The main line caters to lakhs of population residing in Dholewal, Dugri, Gill Road, Partap Chowk and other areas. The chamber was damaged around a week ago and the sewage flow has not stopped. The MC is making efforts to repair the chamber by diverting or slowing down the flow of sewage in the main line. As per MC officials, the chamber is situated near the construction site and was damaged by the Railways while digging a portion near the tracks. The construction works have now been put on hold at the site. One of the MC officials, who wished not to be named, said that it was the main sewer line. “It is not possible to plug the main line, otherwise sewer lines in a major portion of the city will choke. The MC is trying to reduce the flow of the water in the main line by diverting or reducing the inflow, so that the chamber can be repaired. But it will take a few more days,” he added. Area councillor Amrit Varsha Rampal said the line needs to be repaired at the earliest as a major portion of the city will face problems due to clogged sewer lines. Though the sewer lines have not choked as of now, this can be a major issue in future, Rampal said, adding that foul smell has already spread in the area around the construction site. Meanwhile, additional MC commissioner Aditya Dachalwal said the main sewer line was attached to the sewer treatment plant of the civic body and efforts were being made to repair the same at the earliest. “The flow is being reduced and a large amount of accumulated water has been drained out of the RUB site. No complaints have been received regarding clogged sewer lines as of now as the flow has not been stopped completely,” he added. Work stopped, project already moving at snail’s pace The Pakhowal Road ROB/RUBs project has already missed deadlines in the past and the incident is expected to delay the project further as the work has been stopped at the site.Earlier, the authorities had stated that the RUB from Pakhowal Road canal bridge towards Sarabha Nagar will be opened for traffic by August 31, but the deadline was extended to December 31. MC officials, however, said that the construction work will be started soon at the site and the RUB will be completed by December 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-railway-underbridge-in-pakhowal-turns-into-cesspool-101635839494103.html

02-11-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana civic body goes on cleanliness overdrive ahead of Diwali||With an aim to present a cleaner look of the city ahead of the festival of Diwali, Ludhiana municipal corporation (MC) launched a mega cleanliness drive on Monday morning. At MC’s Zone-D office, mayor Balkar Sandhu and municipal commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal directed the staffers, who were asked to report at 7am, to focus on main markets, roads, religious places and green belts and parks. The commissioners of all four MC’s zones were also instructed to collaborate with the councillors to spread awareness and ensure smooth flow of traffic in main markets of the city. It was decided that the drive will be conducted in the main markets, including those of Bhadaur House, Chaura Bazaar, Sector 32 on Chandigarh Road, Sarabha Nagar, Ghumar Mandi, Model Town, and Malhar Road. The sanitation staff was directed to conduct night sweeping in areas where it is difficult to carry on drives during the daytime due to heavy footfall. Directions were also issued to repair road dividers and verges.At a time when the authorities have failed to act against encroachers in the main markets resulting in traffic chaos, the staff was directed to ensure that the encroachments do not become a hindrance in smooth flow of traffic. The health branch officials were asked to ensure timely lifting of garbage from over 40 secondary dumping points in the city and take action against those burning leaves and dumping waste in the green belts and parks. Sabharwal said, “People clean their houses and surroundings on Diwali and the staff of civic body has been directed to ensure that the city also wears a clean look during the festival. The zonal commissioners have been directed to step forward and work in tandem with the councillors as they know their area well. The officials have also been told to clear the choked sewer lines. Inspections will be done on ground level and if any anomalies are found, action will be taken against officers concerned.” ‘Keep in touch with fire brigade’Considering the large number of fire incidents reported in the city on Diwali, the zonal commissioners have been directed to be in touch with the fire brigade under their respective jurisdictions. The vehicles should be kept on standby and temporary stations should also be established to reduce response time on Diwali, they were told. Arrangements should also be made to arrange water from tubewells and industrial units on Tajpur Road, Bahadurke Road and other areas, which are at some distance from the fire stations as precious time is wasted to refill the tenders from the fire stations. ‘Celebrate plastic-free Diwali’The civic body has appealed to the residents to celebrate plastic-free Diwali. Plastic carry bags were banned in the state in April 2016, but are still being used at every nook and corner of the city due to lack of enforcement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-civic-body-goes-on-cleanliness-overdrive-ahead-of-diwali-101635839015266.html

02-11-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: Defunct streetlights to play a spoilsport during Diwali||At a time when Ludhiana is gearing up to celebrate Diwali, defunct LED streetlights in different parts of the city are playing a spoilsport during the festival of lights. As per residents and councillors, the non-functional streetlights on main roads and residential areas also increase the chances of snatching and other crimes. Many people had been complaining against the same in Model Town Extension, Dugri, Bahadurke Road, Bhamiyan Road, BRS Nagar, Field Ganj, and Haibowal among other areas. They say the company that has been given the contract to look after the lights does not pay heed to their issues despite repeated complaints. They express resentment over the municipal corporation’s failure in taking any action against the contractor. Leader of Opposition in the MC House, SAD councillor Jaspal Giaspura also slammed the authorities for making tall claims of cancelling the company’s contract, but not doing anything on the ground level. He said, “The issue has been discussed in MC House meetings several times. Streetlights on main roads of my ward are still lying defunct. In many areas, the problem is persistent for around four months. MC officials had stated that all the lights will be repaired before Diwali, but the ground reality is different.”One of the residents of Shastri Nagar, Monty, said that streetlights on the lane leading to his house near Tirkona park on Model Town-Jawaddi road have been lying defunct for over a week now. “There is always a fear of any accident or snatching. Complaints have also been submitted with MC officials , but to no avail,” he added. One of the MC officials, while requesting anonymity, said that a large number of complaints were pending with the company, but a small number of staffers has been deputed by, which affects the work. Even councillors from the Congress criticised the MC and company for delaying the installation of around 15,000 new streetlights. Over one lakh LED streetlights have already been installed in the city, as claimed by contractor company officials. Congress councillor from ward number 68 Baljinder Bunty said due to delay in installation, many of the areas will be left in dark during Diwali too. “The MC should expedite the process,” he added. MC chief Pardeep Sabharwal said contractor company officials have already been directed to ensure all streetlights were functional, not only near Diwali but on regular days too. “The situation has improved as more men and machinery has been pressed into service after the MC tightened the noose around the company. The staff has also been directed to keep a check on the non-functional lights and get those repaired. Steps are also being taken to ensure installation of new lights at missing points as soon as possible,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-defunct-streetlights-to-play-a-spoilsport-during-diwali-101635838713901.html

Salman had tried to trap us via a middleman. He was arrested and he is in jail. False allegations are being levelled by sharing his WhatsApp chat,” Sameer Wankhede said on Nawab Malik's allegations, according to news agency ANI.“The middleman, who had tried to trap us, had given a false complaint earlier this year to the Mumbai Police. Nothing came out of it. After that peddlers like Salman were used to trap my family.

02-11-2021||Chandigarh||Himachal byelections: Congress scores 4-0, BJP loses to infighting||The opposition Congress swept the byelections in the Mandi Lok Sabha constituency besides the Arki, Fatehpur and Jubbal-Kotkhai assembly segments by defeating the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Himachal Pradesh on Tuesday. Celebrations broke out in the Congress camp even before the Election Commission formally announced the results in the evening. Pratibha Singh, the Congress candidate and wife of former chief minister the late Virbhadra Singh, won from Mandi parliamentary constituency by 7,490 votes. A former two-term member of Parliament from Mandi, Pratibha polled 3,69,565 votes, while her BJP rival Brigadier Khushal Chand Thakur (retd) got 3,62,075 votes. NOTA plays spoilsport for BJPNone of the above (NOTA) played spoilsport for the BJP as it got 12,626 votes. In the 2019 general election, the BJP had won the Mandi seat by more than 4.5 lakh votes. Its voteshare declined by 20.61% in two years. The party had polled 48.14% votes as compared to 68.75% in the 2019 elections. The Congress vote share rose by 23.46%. In the last elections, it polled just 25.64% votes, while this time it got 49.14% of votes. The Mandi seat is significant as it is the home turf of chief minister Jai Ram Thakur for whom this election was a litmus test of his and his party’s popularity as the state heads into an election year. The win also establishes that Pratibha will carry forward the political legacy of Virbhadra Singh, a six-time chief minister who passed away in July. Their son, Vikramaditya Singh, actively campaigned for her in the byelections. Infighting costs BJP dear in Fatehpur In Fatehpur assembly segment, Bhawani Singh Pathania of the Congress won by 5,789 votes. Pathania polled 24,449 votes against the BJP’s Baldev Thakur. Former member of Parliament Rajan Sushant, who contested as an independent candidate this time, polled 12,927 votes, thus playing spoilsport for his former party, the BJP. The ruling party was marred by infighting in Fatehpur, a stronghold of the Congress for more than a decade. The byelection was necessitated after sitting legislator Sujan Singh Pathania passed away due to a prolonged illness in February. His son, Bhawani, quit his job in a banking and insurance company to take the poll plunge. Congress snatches Jubbal-Kotkhai from BJP The Congress snatched the Jubbal-Kotkhai seat from the BJP. Congress nominee and a former two-term legislator, Rohit Thakur, defeated BJP rebel turned independent candidate Chetan Bragta by 6,293 votes. The BJP suffered a humiliating drubbing as its candidate, Neelam Saraik, couldn’t even save her security deposit. The death of BJP MLA Narinder Singh Bragta had necessitated the byelection. Thakur, the grandson of former chief minister Ram Lal Thakur, polled 29,955 votes, while Chetan, the son of Narinder Bragta, got 23,662 votes. Saraik managed to get only 2,644 votes. The BJP’s vote share slid by 45%, while the Congress vote share increased by 4.67% in the constituency. Congress retains Arki seat, infighting hits BJP The Congress also retained the Arki assembly seat that had fallen vacant after former CM Virbhadra Singh’s death in July. Congress candidate Sanjay Awasthi polled 30,798 votes against the 27,579 votes his BJP rival, Rattan Pal Singh, got. In Arki too, infighting harmed the BJP’s prospects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/himachal-byelections-congress-leads-in-mandi-arki-fatehpur-101635834513882.html

02-11-2021||Patna||Bihar bye-elections: RJD seeks removal of returning officer at Kusheshwar Asthan||Just before the counting for bye-elections at Bihar’s Kusheshwar Asthan and Tarapur assembly seats began on Tuesday, the main opposition Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) called upon the Election Commission to remove the returning officer (RO) at Kushweshwar Asthan, arguing that his conduct was under the scanner because he had allegedly intimidated voters during the 2020 assembly polls. In a letter sent to Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sushil Chandra at 12.37am on Tuesday, the RJD’s Rajya Sabha MP Manoj Jha said Sanjeev Kumar Kapar, the returning officer at Kusheshwar Asthan, who is a sub-divisional officer at Biraul, had allegedly intimidated people to vote for the ruling party during the 2020 assembly elections in Bihar. Jha also attached audio and video files with the letter to argue his case and support the charges he made against Kapar.The letter was also circulated among members of the press. Also Read: Tejashwi Yadav confident RJD will win by ‘handsome margin’“We write this to you to convey our strongest reservation that the said officer’s presence as returning officer for the counting process shall seriously undermine the idea of free and fair elections, and hence the officer concerned should be divested of the responsibilities as returning officer for this important exercise,” Jha said in his letter to the CEC. Counting for the two bye-election seats started at 8am on Tuesday, with postal ballots being counted first, followed by EVMs votes. The by-polls are important for both the ruling Janata Dal (United) or JD(U) and the Opposition RJD. Chief minister Nitish Kumar, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ministers, leader of the Opposition, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, and RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav – all of them had taken part in rallies ahead of the elections. Allegations of partisan behaviour of poll officials and misuse of state machinery have been flying thick and fast from both the ruling JD(U) and the RJD. On election day last Saturday, the JD(U) reacted sharply after it emerged from an audio circulating on social media that a block development officer was purportedly talking to a close aide of the party’s nominee from Kusheshwar Asthan in an intimidating manner. Earlier, the RJD complained about alleged partisan behaviour of a deputy superintendent of police (DSP) posted at Biraul in Darbhanga on poll duty. The officer was eventually removed from election duty ahead of the bye-elections. The results of the bye-polls will be significant for both the JD(U) and the RJD.A win for the JD(U) will give the ruling party a much needed opportunity to take on rival RJD in the backdrop of CM Nitish Kumar’s development model and “susshashan ( good governance)” campaign.A victory for the RJD will not only increase the party’s tally of MLAs from 75, it will also give Tejashwi Yadav and Lalu Prasad Yadav the scope to step up pressure on the ruling JD(U), among other advantages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-bye-elections-rjd-seeks-removal-of-returning-officer-at-kusheshwar-asthan-101635832713545.html

02-11-2021||Patna||Electricity in Bihar may be cheaper as existing power tariffs, slabs likely to be revised: Report||Electricity may get cheaper in Bihar as power slabs and tariffs are likely to be revised, reported Hindustan Times's sister publication Live Hindustan. The electricity department has already been strategising to bring the plan to fruition, however, the consent from Bihar Electricity Regulatory Commission (BRRC) is yet to be sought.Speaking to reporters on Monday, energy secretary Sanjeev Hans said that they have been working on reducing the categories in electricity, which was earlier brought down from 90 to 36.The changes will be made in the power slabs too, which will be further brought down to two in the coming days as against the present three.The official also said that a 3 per cent discount is being given on online submission of electricity bills as against 2.5 per cent being given earlier.The official also spoke on the smart, prepaid metres that will be soon installed in Bihar. He said the smart meters will be more beneficial to customers as no fee is charged for installing the smart meters. Once the installation is done, the company that installed the meters will also keep a check for maintenance for at least 8 years.Notably, 17.5 million electricity metres in Bihar will be converted into smart, prepaid metres by 2025. The metres will not require manual reading for billing, distribution of bills, collection of fees and disconnection over non-payment of dues.Earlier this year, the Bihar Electricity Regulatory Commission (BERC) approved an average cumulative hike in power tariff by 0.63% over the existing rate for the financial year 2021-22.For domestic urban customers, the power tariff was hiked by 5 paise to 35 paise per unit. However, for those consuming more power (over 300 units in the existing category), the commission slashed the per unit rate from ₹8.50 to ₹8.05.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/electricity-in-bihar-may-be-cheaper-as-existing-power-tariffs-slabs-likely-to-be-revised-report-101635821288049.html

02-11-2021||Delhi||Ashram crossing bottleneck gets narrower, traffic disarray worsens||The traffic disarray at the Ashram intersection has worsened over the past 10 days, after authorities left just one lane open for traffic moving from Bhogal towards Badarpur, tightening an already narrow bottleneck and making commuters spend about an additional hour at the junction, motorists said.The commuters said that debris, muck, barricading, and additional closures have made the vital intersection even harder to negotiate, with prohibited vehicles, like interstate buses and trucks, adding to the chaos.An HT spot check on Monday backed these claims. With traffic in full flow during the festive season, a terrible traffic situation at a crucial intersection used by around 350,000 vehicles during peak hours each day has effectively been made worse.Subhash Jain (32), a daily commuter on the stretch, said, “You have to keep in mind that you could be stuck for an additional hour in this mess.”The Delhi traffic police on October 23 issued an advisory informing commuters that a lane on Mathura Road for traffic moving towards Badarpur would be shut to make way for the relocation of a 7km-long, high-power transmission line along the Ashram Chowk underpass.“Vehicles coming on Ring Road from Sarai Kale Khan, and taking left towards Badarpur are advised to take CV Raman Marg-Mathura Road or Ashram flyover-Capt Gaur Marg- Modi Mill Flyover for Badarpur. Likewise, traffic on Mathura road from Nizammudin seeking to cross Ashram for Badarpur are advised to turn right and take Captain Gaur Marg-Modi Mill flyover for the onward journey,” the traffic police said in its official advisory.Gyanendra Mishra (48) who was travelling towards Sarita Vihar on Monday, complained about the damaged road along the underpass construction site. “The roads around all the infrastructure projects are very poorly managed. The traffic jam due to construction work is understandable, but at least the roads nearby can be maintained. The Delhi Metro corporation carried out so much work in the city, causing people very little inconvenience,” he said.Aashu Chandel, 28, who rides a motorcycle to his workplace in Faridabad said the situation has worsened over the past one week. “The road has got narrower and new parts have been dug up. It has made the stretch even more difficult to cross,” he said.Traffic police personnel at the intersection admitted that the snarls had got worse over the past week-and-a-half.“We have sent several reminders to the Public Works Department to expedite the project,” a traffic police officer said.“We will consider increasing deployment once the traffic load at other sites eases up due to the festive season,” the officer added.A senior PWD official said the bottleneck due to the barricading will ease only after Diwali.The 750-metre underpass, which connects Nizamuddin railway bridge and CSIR Apartments at the Ashram intersection, has already missed four deadlines since the work began on the project in 2019.Even though work was still on to construct the underpass, the government in February simultaneously launched work on extending the Ashram flyover on Ring Road. The two projects running together have made Ashram — which connects south and central Delhi, and virtually serves as the connection for Noida and Faridabad — a traffic nightmare.Additional commissioner of police (traffic) SD Mishra said, “Keeping in view the problems faced by commuters at the Ashram Chowk, the traffic police force has deployed more forces during the peak commuting hours.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ashram-crossing-bottleneck-gets-narrower-traffic-disarray-worsens-101635810073952.html
02-11-2021||Delhi||As Delhi schools reopen, a first glimpse of classes for some students||Scores of young students in the national capital got their first experience of a school environment on Monday, when they walked into classrooms for the first time in 19 months, albeit with a bit of distancing, face masks, sanitisers and temperature checks.With the Covid-19 threat abating in the capital, the Delhi government allowed public and private schools to resume all classes from Monday, while adhering to strict pandemic protocols.Luvkush, a class 5 student, enrolled at Chirag Enclave-Sarvodaya (Co-ed) Vidyalaya (Kautilya), said he was excited to wear the uniform and meet his friends. “It’s good to be back at school. During online classes, I could not meet my friends. But today, we had a lot of fun. Even though everyone was wearing masks, I could instantly recognise my friends. We also saw a film and played antakshari (a musical game),” said Luvkush, as his father Bhikam Singh looked on.Singh said online classes could not replace the experience of attending a regular school. “Children are very happy to be back in school. It’s a new beginning for them after the closure of schools for nearly two years,” he said.Schools were shut in March last year when a nationwide lockdown was imposed to curb the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19). While in-person classes for students in grades 9-12 restarted in September, children up to class 8 continued with online lessons.“Childhood remains incomplete without school. It is good to see that after a year and a half, children have reached their schools and classrooms. Leaving the difficult times behind, now we all have to move forward,” tweeted Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday.Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who also hold the education portfolio, visited schools and spoke with children and their parents.“Due to the closure of schools, school education had suffered tremendously. However, it is expected that after reopening, our teachers and parents will work together to fight the learning gap in children,” said Sisodia.In line with the Covid-19 SOP issued by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority(DDMA), schools need to limit occupancy in classrooms to 50% of the seating capacity. Staggered seating with sanitisation protocols has to be adopted as students return with mandatory written consent from parents.On Monday, most schools conducted activities along with happiness and mindfulness sessions to ease students into the school environment. While attendance in some schools remained low, others saw a good turnout on the first day. Teachers said students were expected to join the school in increased numbers after Diwali.Chitender Singh Verma, school principal, Chirag Enclave-Sarvodaya (Co-ed) Vidyalaya (Kautilya), said around 45.65% students from kindergarten to class 8 came to school on Monday. The school is calling only 50% of students every day. The day’s lineup of activities included film screening, quizzes, a school tour and mindfulness sessions. “We are keeping it light and interactive in the beginning along with a few lessons. There were a number of interactive activities that will help students acclimatise to life in school again,” said Verma. He said the school will focus on bridging learning gaps through “Mission Buniyaad” in the first three months.The majority of private schools are expected to resume classes from next week, after Diwali. Sudha Acharya, chairperson, National Progressive Schools’ Conference, said over 120 of their member schools will reopen after Diwali. “While a few schools have reopened on Monday, most will start from next week. School need to be readied as they had remained shut for nearly two years,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/as-delhi-schools-reopen-a-first-glimpse-of-classes-for-some-students-101635802853004.html
02-11-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Winter flowers to fill the senses||Winter is here. Those feeling homesick for the golden-yellow flowers of the amaltas must resign themselves to a long wait for the tree’s summertime bloom. Some interim relief will however arrive in the brief spring with the red semal flowers.Meanwhile, the smoggy cold season can be exploited in cultivating a relationship with the saptaparni tree. Now is the time of their bloom. The flowers of the saptaparni, though, are not easily noticeable in their clusters of pale green globules. From a distance, they resemble small brocollis. Unlike the flowers of amaltas, which fall all day long from their branches like a hailstorm of party confetti, the subdued saptaparnis drift down almost imperceptibly, in a spray of powdery fragments. Their bloom spurns showiness. As if the saptaparni were assured of its share of adoration, and doesn’t need the theatrics of pageantry.Here in upscale Golf Links, where the saptaparni is said to have been first introduced in Delhi in the 1940’s, the blossoms are noticeable only to those who actively look for them. Otherwise these flowers smoothly merge into the green of their tree leaves, standing out as unobtrusively as black stars would in a blacker sky.Sometimes, a lucky saptaparni flower plops down on the ground in its entirety, without splintering into shards. One can then place it on one’s palm and study the structure in detail. The flower is not completely green, but glazed with white; each shade’s essence ending up so fragile that one fears both might be vaporised by a passing breeze.Saptaparnis are sighted across the Delhi region. An unusually tall tree in Ghaziabad stands on the rutty side-road that connects Sahibabad Sabzi Mandi to Sector 6 in Vasundhara. A park-facing lane in Gurugram’s Sector 15 A, too, has a row of them.The saptaparni flowers are particularly cherished for their scent but this afternoon they aren’t smelling at all. Hours later, at night, the same tree is now cloaked in a fragrance that is stubbornly restrained—yet effable, pervasive, and intoxicating. One feels mildly tipsy.PS: The photo shows Gufran Siddqui, a chauffeur, holding flowers under a saptaparni tree in central Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-winter-flowers-to-fill-the-senses-101635802185272.html
02-11-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab doesn’t not need ‘lollipops’ but roadmap for people’s welfare: Sidhu||On a day the Charanjit Singh Channi-led Congress government slashed power rates and approved a hike in dearness allowance for government employees, Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu hit out at the “lollipop culture” practiced just two months before the state elections. Sidhu said that Punjab did not need “lollipops” but a definite roadmap for its resurgence and welfare of its people. “How will the welfare of Punjab be achieved? There are two ways. Either you give lollipop, give this free and that free. You do whatever you want for four years and nine months, carry out excesses and then give everything free. Is your only aim to come to power and form the government by telling lies and making 500 promises or work for welfare of people,” he said at an event organised by the newly formed Sanyukt Hindu Mahasabha here. The mahasabha is headed by Congress leader and former MLA Ashwani Sekhri. The PPCC president, who has been miffed over senior appointments and kept the Channi government on tenterhooks, made his first public appearance at the programme. Though Sidhu did not name anyone, his speech is being seen in Congress circles as a direct attack on Channi and his decisions. Channi was appointed as the CM after his predecessor Capt Amarinder Singh resigned following a revolt by Sidhu and several ministers and legislators. However, the change of guard did not end the rift in the state Congress as Sidhu and Channi, who is the first SC chief minister of Punjab, are not on the same page on several issues. Sidhu also asked about the resources for such announcements and cited the ₹5-lakh crore debt burden on the state. “If someone says the state exchequer is flush with funds, then ETT teachers should be paid ₹50,000 salary a month, employees regularised and pension given to those who have not been getting it since 2004,” the Punjab Congress chief said, reiterating that he would continue to show the mirror and not let anyone deviate from issues. He said that before talking about Diwali gift, one must tell who would take the state out of this quagmire and the roadmap. Channi, who had last month claimed that the government coffers were full, termed Monday’s announcements as “Diwali gift” for people of the state. Earlier, the Mahasabha, a grouping of representatives of different Hindu organisations from across the state, demanded post-matric scholarships for children from poor families from the Hindu community and electricity for small shopkeepers at par with the industry at ₹5 per unit. “The idea behind the outfit is to create a platform for Hindus community so that their voice is heard,” Sekhri said. Hollow promise, says AAPAAP national spokesperson and Punjab affairs co-incharge Raghav Chadha on Monday said that the hollow promise of cheap electricity in Punjab is an electoral stunt of “dramebaaz” chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi as the electricity rates have been reduced only till March 31, 2022. In a statement, Chadha said that if the people of Punjab get deceived by this electoral stunt of Congress, then electricity rates will get expensive again five months later. “Channi’s promise is like Capt Amarinder’s fake promise of employment and there is no difference between them,” he claimed, stating that if this is not an election stunt, the Congress should make electricity rates cheaper in Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra where it is in power. He said that Channi was terrified by Arvind Kejriwal’s bijli guarantee, due to which he has made false promises to the people on the issue of electricity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-doesn-t-not-need-lollipops-but-roadmap-for-people-s-welfare-sidhu-101635798930866.html
02-11-2021||Chandigarh||Bir theft case: SIT preparing questionnaire to grill dera chief in Sunaria jail||Ahead of its visit to Sunaria jail in Rohtak to grill Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda head Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, the special investigation team (SIT) probing the 2105 sacrilege cases is preparing a questionnaire on the basis of evidence on record. Last week, a Faridkot court issued production warrants against Ram Rahim in a case of sacrilege wherein a “bir” (copy) of Guru Granth Sahib was stolen from a gurdwara in Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village of Faridkot district on June 1, 2015. But Punjab and Haryana high court directed Punjab Police to grill Ram Rahim in Rohtak jail itself, if it so desired, and directed the jail authorities to make arrangements for the SIT to question the dera head. SIT head inspector general of police Surinder Pal Singh Parmar said the probe team is waiting for the confirmation of date from the Sunaria jail authorities to question Ram Rahim. “We will grill him immediately after getting the confirmation,” he added. An official privy with the development said that: “The SIT is preparing a detailed questionnaire on the basis of evidence collected against the dera head over his role in the 2015 sacrilege cases. The probe team wants to question Ram Rahim before the hearing in the high court on November 12, so it can submit a complete report on the conduct of the dera chief during interrogation. The SIT will seek further instructions from the court if dera head does not cooperate during the interrogation,” the official added. In July 2020, after the arrest of seven dera followers, the SIT led by former inspector general of police Ranbir Singh Khatra had named Ram Rahim and dera’s three national committee members—Sandeep Bareta, Pardeep Kler and Harsh Dhuri— as accused in the case. The “bir” was stolen from Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village gurdwara on June 1, 2015. On October 12, 2015, torn pages of that “bir” were found scattered in front of a gurdwara in the adjoining Bargari village, leading to statewide protests and death of two Sikh protesters in police firing. In its chargesheet, the SIT claimed that it was Ram Rahim who ordered to carry out sacrilege to avenge insult of sect followers by a Sikh preacher. The dera head is lodged in Sunaria jail of Rohtak since August 25, 2017. In 2017, he was awarded 20-year jail term for the rape of two disciples. Subsequently, he has been convicted in murder cases of a journalist, Ram Chander Chhatrapati, and Ranjit Singh, a former dera manager, in which life sentence has been awarded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bir-theft-case-sit-preparing-questionnaire-to-grill-dera-chief-in-sunaria-jail-101635798750791.html
02-11-2021||Chandigarh||Ambala traders look forward to a glittering Diwali as pandemic abates||Diwali, this year, has brought festive cheer to coronavirus- beleaguered businesses, with residents finally being able to shop to their hearts’ content. Ravi Kakkar, 45, who owns a jewellery store in the heart of Ambala City near Jagadhri Gate, says, “Our business depends on large gatherings and so our shop remained closed most of last year due to Covid-induced restrictions. Marriages remained low-key affairs, and business only picked up a little bit around Diwali last year,” he said. It was not just a difficult year for Kakkar workwise, but also on the personal front as he lost his father to age-related ailments and his brother-in-law to Covid.“At least customers are fearlessly wandering around markets this year, which will translate in more sale this dhanteras,” he said. With Ambala being home to one of the largest cloth markets in Asia, with at least 1,000 outlets at Old Cloth Market, Maharaja Agrasen Chowk and Kalka Chowk drawing customers from Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana and even Western Uttar Pradesh, retailers and wholesalers expect the cash counters to keep ringing. Dharamveer Aggarwal, who owns Kala Niketan at the Cantonment’s Sadar Bazar, says, “Sale had picked up around this time last year too as Diwali had coincided with the marriage season. We also deal in women’s designer clothing, which will also pick-up a day before the tikka festival,” he said.Several markets in the city that deal with decoration items, gifts, and artificial jewellery are also recording a huge footfall, especially in the evening. Meanwhile, cops are seen struggling to manage traffic and pedestrian movement. In a different corner of the city, traditional potters at Kumhaar Colony are elated with the increased sales at their makeshift stalls near Ram Bagh Road. Sixty-five-year-old Raj Rani, who buys gilli mitti products from his neighbours, has put-up a stall with her daughters for the second time.“We are requesting locals to buys our products over Chinese lighting sold at showrooms. They are selling the products to drive up their profits, while we need to make a living,” she says, adding that the sales had been dismal last year. Sitting across her stall, Yograj, 74, who has been selling hand-made diyas for decades with his son, believes that sales will be down this year too. “How will devotees use ₹200 per litre mustard oil to light diyas? Rise in fuel prices will also impact sale,” he predicted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ambala-traders-look-forward-to-a-glittering-diwali-as-pandemic-abates-101635798631399.html

02-11-2021||Delhi||‘Call taken due to Covid, pollution’: Delhi doubles down on cracker ban||The Delhi government on Monday told the high court that it will not allow any firecrackers, including “green crackers”, to be sold and used in the Capital in wake of Covid-19 pandemic and the deteriorating air quality.Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva, while hearing a plea by 50 licensed traders seeking to sell the so-called green crackers in Delhi, was told by advocate Naushad Ahmed Khan, additional standing counsel of the Delhi government, that it has seized more than 11,000 kg of firecrackers till October 24 this year.“In the last one year we are not adding any additions to the fire crackers and simultaneously we have carried out raids… wherever large-scale crackers are found… 11,119 kg firecrackers were seized till October 24..,” he said.Khan also told the court that Covid-19 is not over yet, though restrictions have been lifted on several activities.“Covid-19 is not yet over, we have to see all aspects including opening of school, trade avenues and everything we are doing. Some restrictions have been lifted and some are still in place,” he said, adding that the ban is in consonance with the earlier order passed by the Supreme Court on July 23, 2021 where it had said that the use of firecrackers could be disallowed due to considerations such as Covid and air quality.The Delhi government’s submissions were made while hearing the petition filed by Jai Kishan Fireworks, among 50 licensed traders who sought permission to sell green firecrackers in the Delhi-NCR region. The petitioners also sought permission to sell these firecrackers within Delhi to people coming from outside the Capital.Green crackers cause less air pollution than the regular variety since they do not contain barium salts. One of the petitioners said crackers of this variety are not available in Delhi because the state government “did not allow their use despite a go-ahead from the Supreme Court”. The petitioner said he wrapped up his business in the city after the ban.The court, while allowing the petitioners to withdraw their petition, declined to grant permission to sell firecrackers in Delhi, even to people from outside the city.“If somebody were to come, say from an area ‘A’ where the air quality is excellent and there is no prohibition and were to come to you in Delhi and purchase it from you, then the point of sale will be Delhi which would be in contravention of the order of the Supreme Court. The ‘sale and use’ means you can’t sell it in Delhi and you can’t use it in Delhi by bringing it from outside,” justice Sachdeva said.The court also said that in case the petitioners want relief then they ought to have moved the apex court or the National Green Tribunal for clarification.“Please go to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court is already looking into the issue today. Seek clarification. [The high court is the] wrong forum. Inform National Green Tribunal. They are a specialised body,” the judge said.NGT, on December 2, 2020, announced a total ban on the sale and use of all kinds of firecrackers during Covid-19 pandemic in the National Capital Region and all towns in the country where the ambient air quality falls below the “poor” category.This July, the Supreme Court refused to interfere with the NGT order while observing that scientific studies are not needed to ascertain the side effects of firecrackers on the health of citizens.Only 11% bad air plaints in NCR resolved: CPCBAgencies that are supposed to tackle air pollution-related complaints across the National Capital Region are faring poorly, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data. Only 11% of the complaints have been resolved since October 15, when measures under the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) first come into force, the data shows. Delhi is faring worse, with only 9% of all complaints (26 of 277) resolved.Between October 15 and October 30, only 47 of 424 complaints were resolved by agencies in Delhi and NCR cities in Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan.In Delhi, the north corporation received the most complaints so far (103), but has only been able to resolve two of these.This is followed by the south corporation, which received 88 complaints between October 15 and October 30, but was only able to resolve two. The east corporation received 20 complaints, and resolved seven complaints.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/call-taken-due-to-covid-pollution-delhi-doubles-down-on-cracker-ban-101635798040479.html

Today, 11,258 quintal cotton was sold by farmers in different mandis of south Malwa districts.Districts of Bathinda and Mansa, stated by the Punjab government as the worst-hit by pink bollworm attack, reported rates of up to ₹9,600 and ₹9,330 per quintal.Till November 1, Bathinda has recorded 1.30 lakh quintals and private buyers have bought 1.43 lakh quintals.This season, Fazilka, which remained unaffected by the pest attack, is leading with 2.12 lakh quintals and on Monday cotton rate remained ₹8,800-9,095 per quintals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cotton-prices-hit-all-time-high-in-punjab-breach-10k-mark-101635798332226.html

02-11-2021||Chandigarh||Confusion prevails over ‘resignation’ of Punjab advocate general APS Deol||Confusion prevailed on Monday after senior officials in the Punjab chief minister’s office (CMO) said that advocate general APS Deol tendered his resignation while the latter denied the move. Appointed on September 27 after Charanjit Singh Channi took over as chief minister in the wake of Amarinder Singh’s ouster, Deol’s appointment had come under severe criticism with Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu even tendering his resignation. “I met the chief minister since the cabinet was to hold a meeting. This probably led to the speculations. I have neither been asked to resign nor I have I done on my volition,” Deol said. Channi, who was questioned about the development after the cabinet meeting, ducked the query. Earlier, Deol did not attend calls for nearly five hours after senior officials “confirmed” the senior lawyer having put in his papers. Soon after Deol’s appointment in September, Sidhu resigned from his post opposing his appointment and that of Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota as director general of police (DGP). Sidhu has been adamant on his replacement and conveyed the same to the Congress high command. Deol, 61, had shot into limelight earlier this year when he secured bail of former director general of police (DGP) Sumedh Singh Saini who was arrested by the vigilance bureau in a 2020 criminal case. Deol had also appeared for Saini, among other accused, in the 2015 post-sacrilege violence cases in the high court. This became the reason for the criticism of the government following his appointment. Several Sikh organisations had also opposed his appointment saying a person who defended those accused in sacrilege cases could not be appointed as AG. To counter the criticism, Deol brought in criminal lawyer Rajwinder Singh Bains as special public prosecutor to defend these cases. However, this move also ran into controversy as Bains in the past had appeared for one complainant in sacrilege cases. Last week, the government had to give an undertaking to the high court that Bains will not appear in post-sacrilege violence cases till November 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/confusion-prevails-over-resignation-of-punjab-advocate-general-aps-deol-101635797432231.html

This was our duty,” said Suvendu Adhikari, leader of the opposition in the assembly. The speaker could not be contacted. Ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) legislators refused to comment on the speaker’s decision, saying it was his jurisdiction. Adhikari also announced that BJP legislators will not attend the assembly session till November 15 because of the festivals.“The ruling party should not have convened the session in this festive season. We cannot attend the session because we have to stay among the common people and share their joy during the coming Kali puja, Diwali, Chhat puja and Jagatdhatri puja. We will come to the assembly on the last three days if the session continues till then,” Adhikari said. The session is scheduled to continue till Noveber 18.Though the BJP bagged 77 seats in Bengal, it is now effectively left with 70 legislators as five have joined to the TMC since June and two legislators did not take oath to retain their Lok Sabha seats. Bypolls in these two seats were held on October 30.The ruling party, on the other hand, has officially increased its tally from 213 to 215 by winning two Murshidabad district seats where polls were held on September 30. Two candidates who filed their papers from these seats died of Covid-19 before the March-April polls. On October 30, bypolls were held at Dinhata in Cooch Behar district, Santipur in Nadia district, Khardah in North 24 Parganas and Gosaba in South 24 Parganas. Two of these constituencies, Dinhata and Santipur, were won by the BJP in the March-April polls but the winners did not take oath to retain their Lok Sabha seats. In the remaining two, the TMC’s winning candidates died. All four districts, where the bypolls were held, are located along the Bangladesh border and have a record of illegal infiltration, smuggling and influx of Hindu refugees during India’s partition in 1947 and creation of Bangladesh after the 1971 war. Since Hindus are in the majority in all these seats, the BJP referred to history in its campaign and focused on the recent attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bjp-protests-bangladesh-killings-in-bengal-assembly-mlas-march-with-candles-101635797370684.html

02-11-2021||Chandigarh||Eye on assembly elections, Punjab govt slashes power tariff by ₹3 per unit||In a populist move ahead of the 2022 assembly elections, the Punjab government on Monday announced to slash power tariff by ₹3 per unit for domestic consumers. The decision that came into effect from Monday itself was taken in a cabinet meeting chaired by chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi. It will be applicable for the consumers having an installed load capacity up to 7 kilowatt (kW). The reduction in power tariffs was one of the 18-point agenda that the Congress high command had given for implementation to the state government ahead of the state polls when Amarinder Singh was the chief minister. Addressing a press conference after the cabinet meeting, Channi said it was a “big Diwali gift” for people of Punjab. Nearly 69 lakh (95%) of a total of 72 lakh domestic consumers will benefit from the move that will put an additional burden of ₹3,316 crore per year on the state exchequer, he said. Citing a survey conducted by the government, the CM said people wanted quality and cheap power. With this decision, the tariffs for the domestic category have become cheapest in the country, he claimed. “People of Punjab do not want anything free. They want quality power at cheaper rates,” he said while quoting the survey.Channi said for up to 100 units of consumption (up to 2 kW), the power tariff will drop to ₹1.19 per unit from ₹4.19 per unit and for 101-300 units, the tariff will be ₹4.01 and for above 300 units, the power rate will be ₹5.76 per unit. Similarly, power rates for more than 2 kW and up to 7 kW will also come down. Taking about the AAP government in Delhi, Channi said its power subsidy is ₹2,220 crore per year as against ₹14,000 crore in Punjab.His government was procuring power at a cheaper rate and would pass on the benefit to consumers, the CM said.Monday’s announcement takes the total subsidy burden on the state exchequer to ₹13,974 crore, including ₹10,628 crore free electricity to 14 lakh agriculture tubewells, scheduled caste and backward class (SC/BC) consumers, and industrial units. Channi clarified that the existing free power facility for consumers with the load up to 1 kW to SC, OBC, BPL categories will continue. About residential consumers with load capacity over 7 kilowatts, he said that their number was “very small” and are from the creamy layer and hence needed no benefit. After Channi took charge as CM, the state government has already waived pending default bills of consumers having connected load of less than 2 KW. Also, the government was also considering shifting to monthly billing cycle instead of the existing 2 months so that the higher rates are not charged with increase in consumption, he added.

Warning those at the mining site against charging above the government rate of ₹9 per cubic feet, they asked department officials to keep constant vigil. The officers also directed mining officials to install boards displaying rates at all mining sites so that no one can dare to charge exorbitantly. Meanwhile, they also interacted with the tractor-trolley owners who came to the quarries, who informed them that they have started getting sand at the fixed price. The SSP also held a meeting with senior police officers and issued directions to keep a check on the illegal mining.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sbs-nagar-dc-ssp-inspect-mining-de-silting-sites-101635797070715.html

He had skipped at least five such ED notices. The money laundering case against Deshmukh and others was made out after the CBI booked him in a corruption case related to allegations of at least ₹100 crore bribery made by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ed-arrests-ex-maharashtra-home-minister-anil-deshmukh-in-money-laundering-case-101635796856197.html
02-11-2021||Chandigarh||Srinagar MC to start census of street vendors this month||The Srinagar municipal corporation (MC) has decided to start a census of street vendors in the city for rehabilitating them and establishing vending zones.Mayor Junaid Mattu said the civic body will start the exercise this month. “Srinagar MC will start a city-wide street vendor census this month to identify, classify and register street vendors in all 74 wards of the city,” Mattu said in a tweet.He said this will form the basis for their rehabilitation and establishment of flea markets and vending or non-vending zones in the city. “And (this will) also ensure the success of PM-SVANidhi,” he said.Last June, the Ministry of housing and urban affairs had launched the PM Street Vendor’s Atma Nirbhar Nidhi (PM SVANidhi) for providing affordable loans upto ₹10,000 to street vendors, hawkers or cart pullers selling vegetables, fruits, street food, apparel etc. The aim was to help them resume their business after the Covid-19 pandemic and consequent lockdowns adversely impacted their livelihood.The Srinagar MC is mulling to identify some major vending zones for the rehabilitation of the street vendors.Deputy mayor Parvaiz Qadri said after PM SVANidhi was launched last year, they were not able to register the street vendors for the scheme fully as there was no official data on their numbers and types.He said the census will not only help them register people for centrally sponsored schemes but also help in rehabilitation of people in this unorganised sector.“There is also an increased demand to de-clutter our city’s major markets. The street vendors are a major cause of congestion, roadblocks and traffic snarls. We are planning to set up some vending zones in the city where their vendors can be rehabilitated,” he said. Qadri added the data will help them know how many vending zones are needed to accommodate these street vendors.“We are primarily looking at major markets such as Parimpora, Batamaloo, Hari Singh High Street, Sarai Bala and Nawhatta where these vendors are present in good numbers. The exercise will take some time, at least over a month,” he said.He said there is already a vending zone like Mecca Market in the city and another one has been set up near Kashmir Haat, where they have been installing kiosks for registered vendors. “We are attempting to rehabilitate every vendor,” he said. In May, the government, in its annual report showcasing major initiatives undertaken during 2020-21, had stated that it had provided a special credit facility for street vendors with an initial working capital of ₹1,000. It was disbursed to 11,276 cases under PM-SVANidhi Scheme, the government had stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/srinagar-mc-to-start-census-of-street-vendors-this-month-101635796771836.html

The legalisation of MSP (Minimum Support Price) doesn’t mean guarantee of procurement, but government should give guarantee of procurement of the crop on MSP,” added Sainath, speaking at the closing session of Ghadri Babeyan Da Mela (Ghadrites) at the Desh Bhagat Yaadgar Hall in Jalandhar on Monday. During his address, he also hailed the farm protest for being peaceful. “It has been the biggest peaceful protest across the world in the past five years. Sixteen years after it was tabled in Parliament, the Swaminathan Commission has not been implemented as it was pro-farmer and prepared in consultation with real farmers.” “Farmers should form their own commission at the national level, comprising farmers and farm labourers from every sector of farming. The commission will study the issues or problems of farming sector of the country and counter the government’s studies, even in courts,” he said, adding that it will add new energy among farmers. He added that the government will not be able to shut the independent commission of farmers, which could be extended to the state, district or block level. He claimed that farm suicide numbers were going up, but they (the government) were tinkering with the calculation of these figures by recreating new categories. “After 2015, it is not possible to compare with the earlier data as there is change of the methodology,” he added. Sainath underlined farmers’ ventures should be in the hands of farmers, not of corporations. It could be made much more profitable by the implementation of the Swaminathan Commission recommendation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/farmers-need-to-form-own-independent-commission-sainath-101635796651367.html

Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) has forecast smoggy days ahead, and bursting of crackers on Diwali will compound pollution woes. PAU department of climate change and agricultural meteorology head Prabhjyot Kaur Sidhu said, “The wind speed across the state is around 3km per hour since the last week of October, contributing immensely to worsening the pollution.” She added, “Low wind speed and dip in temperature makes a closed-room condition in which hardly anything enters or goes out. So, the smoke becomes a suspended particle that just keeps hanging in the air.” On the possible remedy for this, she added, “The only possibility of improving air quality is due to western disturbance which brings rain or any climatic condition which leads to high-velocity winds, which is highly unlikely, at present.” She added that on Sunday (October 31), the Air Quality Index (AQI) in Ludhiana was 254, on Monday it dipped to 261. The AQI of Amritsar was recorded at 245 on Monday; Patiala 231; Jalandhar 220. An AQI between 200 and 300 is classified as poor and causes breathing problems for most of the population. Firecrackers around Diwali worsen the problem, with smog witnessed for 12 days in 2020; 10 days in 2019 and 11 days in 2018 in November. ‘DELAYED CROPPING CYCLE TO BE BLAMED’Prabhjyot added a delayed cropping cycle is also contributing to the pollution. Earlier, paddy crop was harvested by September, when the temperatures were high and the wind speed remained around 9km per hour. “High temperature and strong wind evaporate smoke. Conversely, when the weather remains still and chilly conditions, along with fog, envelop the state in October and the beginning of November. Under such a situation, setting stubble residue on fire could be hazardous,” she added. DC CLAIMS 37% DIP IN STUBBLE BURNINGEven as the AQI is deteriorating each passing day, Ludhiana deputy commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma on Monday claimed that Ludhiana has witnessed 37% reduction in stubble burning cases over the past year. Addressing farmers during a Kisan Mela organised by the agriculture and farmers’ welfare department, the DC said, “ The district has witnessed a dip in stubble burning incidents by 37% this time from September 15 to October 31 to 826 from 1,316 cases.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/smoggy-days-ahead-crackers-will-compound-pollution-warns-pau-101635796290523.html

Party’s chief spokesperson Syed Suhail Bukhari said the PAC resolved that the party would redouble its efforts to fight the designs of dividing and disempowering the people of Jammu & Kashmir and give voice to the concerns and aspirations of all people of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh.“The meeting also reiterated the party’s demand of immediate release of all political prisoners and speedy and impartial investigations into the cases of recent civilian killings.

Now to cover its sins, the state government is making desperate attempts,” said party state general secretary Subhash Sharma.He said the state government’s appeasement strategy by announcing hike in dearness allowance (DA) was ironic as the employees were still paid on the basis of the 6th pay commission recommendations.The employees in Punjab have suffered a lot in the last over four years even as the Narendra Modi government at the Centre has implemented the 7th pay commission, he said. Govt befooling people: SAD The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Monday accused chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi of defrauding the people of Punjab by rolling back the 35% hike in power tariff, which had been earlier affected by the Congress government.The SAD said the government would still be taking ₹3,791 crore more from power consumers by reducing power tariff by ₹3 per unit, instead of implementing the 800 units per bill cycle free power commitment of the SAD-BSP alliance. Addressing a press conference here, SAD spokesman Daljit Singh Cheema said that state Congress unit president Navjot Sidhu has exposed the Congress government by telling that it only wants to fool people during the last two months in office asking the government to specify from where it would come up with the money to honour its promise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/power-tariff-cut-a-political-stunt-bjp-101635796050550.html

Police have been able to identify the duo on basis of the registration number of the Hyundai i20 car, in which the group fled after firing three shots following a drunken brawl over wrong parking. One of the bullets had grazed past the knee of an Ambala man, which led to the registration of an attempt to murder case.

We will save this water and regularise illegal water connections outside the lal dora.” AAP election campaign committee chairman Chandramukhi Sharma said: “The BJP has failed to provide adequate water to the city residents despite a surplus.” Sharma said the daily per capita water consumption in the city is 245 litres, as compared to the national average of 135 litres per head. “This indicates the city has surplus water... then why is the government charging three times the cost and where is the surplus water going from the city?” he said, while demanding an inquiry into this “matter of concern”.The MC is expected to launch the 24x7 water supply project next month. Funded by the European Union and French government, the ₹500 crore project includes a soft loan of ₹413 that is to be repaid in 15 years.

02-11-2021||Chandigarh||India ends policy of wooing Khalistani elements abroad||The cancellation of nearly a dozen Overseas Citizen of India or OCI cards in recent weeks marks the possible end of an initiative launched in 2015 to woo Khalistani elements abroad who had moderated their stand over the years. That initiative started following the visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Canada in 2015 and featured backchannel discussions between Indian intermediaries and former votaries of Khalistan in the country as well some in the United KingdomNew Delhi had also simultaneously pruned a blacklist of Khalistanis, who had earlier been prevented from entering India, with some being allowed to get the OCI cards, a lifelong visa.However, as Khalistani elements in Canada hijacked the anti-farm law protests in the country, New Delhi has resorted to a harder line by cancelling some OCI cards, which a senior official said totalled a dozen across several countries, including the United States.Among those who played a part in the introduction of the leniency initiative was then high commissioner to Canada Vishnu Prakash. He told HT that the effort had “mixed results” even as the government had “been reaching out and responding to the overtures of former Khalistani sympathisers”.The trigger for the change of course and starting a new blacklist was the surge in pro-Khalistan sentiment in countries like Canada after anti-farm law protests started in India. The new measures, a senior Indian official said, were meant as a “warning” to those indulging in anti-India activities in countries like Canada. “The behaviour and false propaganda of the Khalistani elements against agricultural reforms in India is pretty disappointing,” Prakash said.The new measures were discussed following the surge in such activity from December 2020. Other than the cancellation of the OCI cards, there is greater scrutiny when it comes to granting emergency visas to travel to India, as a senior official said, there were “strong checks put in place and diligence so that only those genuinely in need” were issued these documents.While the original blacklist featured names of Khalistanis, who had been openly involved fomenting violence in India during the 1980s and 1990s, the new regime includes those funding and providing material support for a resurgence of pro-Khalistan sentiment in India under the guise of backing the anti-farm laws movement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/india-ends-policy-of-wooing-khalistani-elements-abroad-101635795812168.html

The CM disclosed that a notice had been served to GVK for cancellation of the PPA. The PPAs with the other two supercritical thermal plants; L&T-owned 1,400 MW at Rajpura and Vedanta group’s 1,980 MW at Mansa are also under the scanner. The cancellation of these PPAs, which were signed during the tenure of SAD-BJP government, was part of the pre-poll promise made by the Congress ahead of the 2017 state polls for the exorbitant tariff it imposed. The demand for the cancellation of these PPAs was raised during the tenure of Capt Amarinder Singh as state CM, by leaders within the party. The issue also became a rallying point for Capt’s removal. “This costly power will be replaced with the low-cost power from solar generation. Reduction in power cost will be passed to the consumers,” said the CM, adding that GVK was supplying power at rate of Rs. 6-7 a unit, while PSPCL has procured 250 MW solar power at Rs. 2.33 a unit and allotted 150 MW of solar plants to be established in state at the rate of ₹2.69 per unit. PSPCL has also issued a default notice to the Talwandi Sabo Thermal Plant for its failure to give proper supply during last paddy season. According to PSPCL chairman-cum managing director A Venu Prasad, the penalty amount works out to be between ₹600 and ₹800 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ppas-with-two-other-thermal-plants-to-be-reviewed-as-well-channi-101635794850843.html
02-11-2021||Chandigarh||Ellenabad bypoll: Counting of votes today||The counting of votes for the Ellenabad bypoll in Haryana’s Sirsa district will take place on Tuesday. The bypoll for this assembly seat had taken place on October 30.Over 81.38% voters turnout was reported in Ellenabad, while in the 2019 assembly polls, 83.24% voter turnout was reported from here. The fate of Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) nominee Abhay Singh Chautala, his former aide and Congress candidate Pawan Beniwal and BJP’s Gobind Kanda will be decided with this.Though as many as 17 candidates were in the fray, the main contest is said to be between these three leaders.Sirsa deputy commissioner Anish Yadav said the counting of votes will start at 8am. “Three-tier security will be deployed to ensure peaceful counting. The counting of votes will be done first followed by counting of EVM votes,” the DC said.The DC and other senior officials visited the counting centre in Sirsa to check the arrangements.INLD supremo and former Haryana chief minister OP Chautala said Abhay will win the bypoll with a thumping majority.“I have received feedback from villages and my analysis predicts that the bypoll was a cakewalk for party nominee Abhay. The farmers’ anger is brewing against the ruling BJP-JJP alliance,” he added.The bypoll was necessitated after INLD’s lone MLA Abhay Singh Chautala had resigned from the Haryana assembly on January 27 after the Republic Day violence at Red Fort, in support of the farmers protesting against the farm laws.The Ellenabad bypoll is just as crucial for the INLD because it’s the only seat in the 90-member Haryana assembly from where the INLD had won in 2019.A decisive win would reassert the INLD’s stature in state politics, particularly in the Jat-dominated farming belt.On the other hand, the BJP sees the bypoll as a golden opportunity for it and a test for the INLD, which has been holding the agriculture-dominated seat since 1996.Abhay has been representing the constituency since 2010, while the BJP has never won from here. No member of the Chautala family has lost from here so far since 1966.This assembly seat includes 35% Jat voters, a majority of whom are dependent on agriculture. Hence, INLD’s Abhay has been expecting their support amid the farm agitation. However, the BJP is trying to get majority of the non-Jat chunk of votes as it has fielded turncoat Gobind Kanda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ellenabad-bypoll-counting-of-votes-today-101635794612177.html

In a judgment dated October 27, justice Prathiba M Singh said the hospital administrations shall ensure that steps are taken to monitor such contractors on a regular basis.The court said it will be the responsibility of the medical superintendent of the hospital to ensure that the contractual workers are not abused or misused in any manner and that their salaries payments are proper, in accordance with the amount being released by the hospitals.“For selection of the contractual firm through GeM, two separate and independent committees, bid finalisation committee and bid evaluation committee, comprising non-administrative faculty members will be constituted,” the the judge said in a 15-page order. She also said approval shall be obtained from the ministry concerned for award of contract, after the bids are evaluated and finalised.The court was dealing with a plea filed by contractually employed persons, working at the Lady Hardinge Medical College and Hospital, challenging the illegal termination of their services. The workers contended that the new contractor was coercing them to pay money to ensure their continued employment.Perusing the report by the committee, appointed by the Union health ministry, the court said there were several gaps in the recruitment of contractual workers.Issuing a slew of directions, the court said the hospital administration shall create awareness among the outsourced workers about their dues and statutory deductions.“For the said purpose, when they report for duty for the first time, a senior person from the hospital administration shall try and hold an interactive session in the presence of the contractor to sensitise them as to their rights and duties,” the court said.The judge said proper and transparent criteria shall be fixed and, once the contractor has finalized the workers, the administration shall verify their identity cards and documents before they are allowed to report for duty.While directing the constitution of a committee comprising at least two senior persons – one from administration and one from the faculty, the court said committee would interact with the outsourced employees on a quarterly basis to ascertain whether they are facing any difficulties, including with regards to salaries and other payments.“In accordance with the committee’s recommendations, salary slips may be issued each month to the outsourced workmen showing the breakup of admissible salary and statutory deductions, and the net salary payable through the bank must reflect on the salary slips,” the court said.It further said a complaint box shall be put up in a prominent place on the hospital premises, so that any contractual workers may submit their grievances, in an anonymous manner if they so choose. These complaints shall also be looked into, and action taken within two weeks of receiving the complaint.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hc-issues-directions-on-employing-contractual-staff-in-hospitals-101635794381256.html
02-11-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana Police constable aspirants miffed over difficult question paper||Haryana male constable aspirants were upset after the recruiting body, the Haryana Staff Selection Commission (HSSC)’s question paper explored their knowledge at different levels and had just one question regarding Haryana. Besides, there were questions from other fields.Around 5,500 posts of male constables will be filled through this examination, which started on October 31 and will continue till November 2.The constable aspirants and teachers were surprised with the difficulty level and the fact that just one question was asked from the state’s current affairs of 100 questions (each carrying 0.8 marks).The aspirants said maximum questions in the written exam were asked from biology, economics, polity, and English.Suresh Kumar, an aspirant from Mahendergarh, said he had appeared for the written exam in Panchkula on October 31. “We had studied Haryana’s current affairs for months and just one question was asked from it. While in the sub-inspector exam, which was conducted recently, majority of the questions were on Haryana. I was surprised to see questions on international relations, botany and advanced level geography,” he added.Another aspirant Praveen Malik, from Sonepat, said the written exam for the constable posts was much more difficult than that of the sub-inspectors.“The HSSC has failed to repose faith in Haryana youth. The question paper was difficult and only students who had taken coaching for CGL or other competitive exams could clear it. Different question papers were being given to students and we don’t know on what parameters the normalisation will be initiated while declaring the results,” he added.The HSSC had faced major criticism after it asked “unusual questions” in the sub-inspector exam held in September. Among the questions that had raised eyebrows include one on the “speciality of Haryana home minister Anil Vij”.Candidates were given four options to choose from: Vij is highly-educated, has been a home minister before, is unmarried, or has served as a police officer.INLD general secretary Abhay Singh Chautala, in a press statement, slammed the HSSC and the Haryana government and accused them of keeping away youth of rural areas from getting recruited in police by setting difficult question papers.“The commission had asked high-level questions and eligibility for the exam was just Class 12. How can we expect that a Class 12 passout will answer Masters and PhD level questions? More than 500 answer sheets were found blank in the women’s written examination which was held in September. This proves that irregularities are being done. We demand an enquiry by a setting judge and dismantling of the HSSC,” he added.HSSC chairman Bhopal Singh Khadri said the question paper was set keeping in mind the Haryana Police rules. “We cannot do anything about the questions being asked and their level of difficulty. Our job is to ensure free and fair recruitment,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-police-constable-aspirants-miffed-over-difficult-question-paper-101635794380066.html

Data provided by the Delhi chief electoral officer (CEO) also showed that the draft roll saw a decline of 102,520 voters when compared to the last list published in January this year, which election officers said could be attributed to the Covid-19 pandemic. not many people would have been able to register themselves on the electoral rolls earlier due to the pandemic-induced restrictions in place, they said.The special summary revision is significant because Delhi will hold municipal elections sometime in April next year. The final electoral roll will be published on January 5, 2022. Addressing a press conference, Delhi CEO Ranbir Singh said Delhi has 14,795,549 registered voters according to the draft roll published on Monday. The total number of electors in the final electoral roll of the Delhi on January 15, 2021, was 14,898,069, which was 205,933 more than the total electors -- 14,692,136 -- in the final roll published on January 6, 2020, data with the CEO office showed.“In the past few years, we saw an increase in voters’ registration due to the Lok Sabha and Delhi Assembly elections. But this year, 319,222 voters were deleted from the list due to duplication, dead entries, and change of addresses. The Covid-19 pandemic could also be the reason why not many got their names registered or updated in the electoral rolls. Usually, the enthusiasm to get a voter ID card peaks around elections. With MCD elections scheduled next year, we hope more people register with us this month,” said Singh.

The sale of banned crackers is on with impunity across the state, with enforcement missing. Ludhiana, Kurali Amritsar, Bathinda and several other cities and districts are selling crackers, despite the state government’s October 26 orders.In its order routed through the department of science, technology and environment, the government had cited orders from the Supreme Court and the National Green Tribunal. Citing rising pollution levels, the order said that only green crackers, which are manufactured without using barium salts or compounds of antimony, lithium, mercury arsenic, lead or strontium, chromate, were allowed for sale and use in the state. Wholesalers and traders dealing in traditional crackers claim that it is not feasible to introduce green crackers in the market by announcing restrictions just around a week before Diwali. “Green crackers are much costlier than the traditional crackers available in the market. Even if we had got them, sale will have dropped drastically,” a trader said. A Jalandhar wholesale trader, requesting anonymity, said, “The government should start the process of introducing green crackers by imposing a ban on the manufacturing of traditional crackers and promote green crackers. Sivakasi in Tamil Nadu is hub of cracker manufacturing.” “People are excited to celebrate Diwali as the pandemic played spoilsport last year. Only a few varieties of crackers are available in the market and this ban, if properly enforced, will dampen the festive mood,” said another dealer. The traders in a temporary cracker market established in the Grain Market near the Jalandhar bypass in Ludhiana said, “Some local companies have started pasting stickers of green crackers on normal boxes, as it is difficult for even department officials to differentiate between the two categories.The ban will also result in losses to traders, who have stocked the traditional crackers in large quantities.”Lambasting the authorities for allegedly making hollow claims just to save their skin before the NGT and the courts, environmentalist Balbir Singh Seechewal said nothing is done to enforce the laws at ground level. “I appeal to residents to stop polluting the environment in the name of religion and festivals. The money wasted on crackers can be used to help the needy,” Seechewal said. Passing the buck for enforcement of norms to the district administration, Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) member secretary Krunesh Garg said, “The PPCB has just been tasked with monitoring air quality and action has to be taken by the district administration in their respective areas.”Ludhiana deputy commissioner Varinder Sharma maintained that checking was being done and only Green Crackers are being allowed for sale in the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punjabs-ban-on-normal-crackers-goes-up-in-smoke-101635794311691.html

A blanket ban on the sale and use of crackers had been imposed by the UT administration on October 12, which had come as a setback for firecracker dealers across the city. As such the Chandigarh Cracker Dealers’ Association had asked the administration to issue temporary cracker licences for Diwali and Gurupurab festivals.In a letter to district magistrate Mandip Singh Brar, the association’s president Davinder Kumar Gupta and general secretary Chirag Aggarwal had said that despite specific guidelines from the National Green Tribunal and the Supreme Court pertaining to the sale of green crackers, the administration had imposed a complete ban in the UT.“The Supreme Court on Monday set aside an order of the Calcutta high court promulgating a blanket ban on crackers in West Bengal. Even the states surrounding Chandigarh have allowed the sale and bursting of crackers as per the orders of NGT and the Apex Court,” the letter said, adding that the administration was depriving members of the association from earning a living, which is their constitutional right.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cracker-ban-not-to-be-diluted-in-chandigarh-ut-advisor-dharam-pal-101635794310341.html

The commission had clearly mentioned in its advertisement that the criteria to be followed in the written exam will be as per the qualifications of Class 12. I can assure that the CM and his entire cabinet will not get even 33% marks in the exam,” he said.“I invite the DGP, additional DGP and IG level officers of Haryana to solve this question paper and I’m quite sure that they will fail,” he added. Questions related to Haryana and pertaining to the eligibility criteria for a police constable’s job are missing in the question paper, he said.The Congress leader said that instead of testing the calibre and competence of Haryana youngsters, the commission and the BJP-JJP government in state are playing a “cruel joke” with them. “This is a conspiratorial method to exclude deserving candidates from the selection process and accommodate favourites through manipulation,” he alleged.The Congress leader said if one goes through the eight papers presented to the candidates on October 31, one will find that even the DGP, the CM or the home minister will not be able to answer the questions.“I found that of 95 questions, only one or two were pertained to Haryana. The question arises as to whether police constable recruitment is being made for WTO or a foreign country. Questions should have been about geographical, social and political situation of Haryana, Indian Penal Code, fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution, human rights, etc. However, the eight papers had questions pertaining to MA or PhD level botany, zoology, sociology, international history, international general knowledge, MSc level mathematics, etc,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/even-khattar-dgp-will-fail-to-answer-questions-of-constable-recruitment-exam-surjewala-101635794132458.html
02-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Gopal Rai urges students to say no to crackers this Diwali||Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai on Monday met schoolchildren and teachers as part of the government’s anti-firecracker campaign, and urged young students to educate their peers so that no one bursts cracker this year in their neighbourhoods. “Diwali is coming and these days, fewer diyas (lamps) are lit and more crackers are burst. When these crackers go off, it is certainly nice to watch the lights and hear the sound, but along with the sound and lights, these crackers also produce smoke and poisonous gases that mix with the air. When we breathe in this air, all these toxins enter our bodies and harm the lungs. A lot of people find it hard to breathe in such circumstances, and the children and the elderly are especially at risk,” said Rai, while interacting with students on Monday. Urging them to promise that this Diwali, Delhi will be lit with diyas and not crackers, Rai said this was a pledge to protect people’s lives. “A lot of parents that I spoke to said they themselves did not like crackers but they couldn’t help bursting them since their children would insist. We have to remember that when the first Diwali was celebrated, there were no firecrackers; only diyas. All of us will celebrate a glorious Diwali this year, together and without any crackers. Spread this message and try to convince as many as you can,” Rai said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhigopal-rai-urges-students-to-say-no-to-crackers-this-diwali-101635794131263.html
02-11-2021||Delhi||Health minister Mansukh Mandaviya directs Delhi to up dengue testing||As the number of dengue cases crossed the 1,500-mark in the national capital, Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya reviewed the situation on Monday, directing officials to ramp up testing so that all cases are reported and treated properly. According to official data, Delhi recorded 1,537 cases and six deaths due to the vector-borne disease until October 30.“Primary healthcare centres may prescribe anti-pyretic drugs to suppress the symptoms without addressing the root cause, which may lead to the eventual demise of the patient. Since testing is the most important step to identifying dengue, these deaths will not be reported as such and the disease will continue to be under-reported,” said Mandaviya during the review. Highlighting the urgency of intervention, the minister pointed out that while many poor people could be affected by dengue, several of them may not be diagnosed properly and their deaths were likely to be unreported. “The last two weeks have been bad in terms of the number of cases; and it looks like a mix of strains is prevalent--dengue 1 and 2. The disease outcome depends largely on when the disease is diagnosed and whether you are well-hydrated and have your vital parameters, such as blood count, liver function etc. in check. Many patients delay going to a doctor, resulting in their condition deteriorating,” said Dr Rommel Tickoo, director (internal medicine), Max Healthcare. The Union health minister assured Delhi of his full support in controlling and managing the vector-borne viral disease. The Union health minister also stressed the need for effective coordination between the Centre and states, and said that officials from the health ministry will support their counterparts in the Delhi government to chalk out a detailed action plan to combat the rising cases of dengue. He said that since it seemed as if some hospitals were over-burdened with dengue cases, while beds remained empty in others, the Union health ministry suggested Delhi officials look into the possibility of repurposing beds reserved for Covid-19 patients for dengue patients. He also suggested the Delhi health officials carry out on-ground initiatives such as hotspot identification, fogging and timely treatment to curb the disease. “Use of mosquito nets, full sleeved clothing, indoor fogging are to be encouraged,” he said. Now that the schools are being reopened, Delhi government will begin a campaign to sensitise school children on larvae control, and training them to ensure there is no water storage in flower pots, feeding bowls for birds, coolers etc. Among other measures for vector control, biological larvicide fish like Gambusia have been deployed at 163 sites, the Delhi government said. Delhi government recently declared dengue a notified disease that is likely to enhance reporting and monitoring of the disease. As of now, Delhi is monitoring all fever cases, suspected dengue cases and confirmed cases. All hospitals have been converted to sites with zero tolerance for mosquito breeding, and a mosquito net will be provided to all dengue patients so that non-dengue patients undergoing treatment do not get infected. “Although only 10% cases are complicated and mortality seldom crosses 1%, all Delhi Government health officials assured the Union Health Minister that the outbreak shall be contained with the help of all stakeholders…,” read the health ministry statement. Apart from Delhi, the health minister also directed officials to focus on those states reporting dengue cases. Mandaviya directed the Union health secretary, Rajesh Bhushan, to identify and send teams of experts to states with reporting high active dengue cases. The meeting also discussed the new vaccines developed to target dengue that is being tried in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/health-minister-mansukh-mandaviya-directs-delhi-to-up-dengue-testing-101635794071820.html
02-11-2021||Delhi||Cyber fraud uses malware to hack phones via messaging apps: Delhi police||The city police force has stumbled upon a rare cyber fraud with the arrest of a 33-year-old Nigerian national who allegedly hacked phones and used messaging apps such as WhatsApp to either blackmail the owner or impersonate the person to ask money from their contacts.Police said that in this case, the accused, Chimelum Emmanuel Aniwetalu, alias Maurice Degri, sent a malware links -- disguised as links for gifts and lucrative offers -- to gain control of the victim’s phone.While a similar fraud in which email accounts of victims are hacked has become common in the last 10-15 years, police said this is the first time in Delhi that they are coming across an instance of malwares being used to get remote access of a person’s phone and use it to take control of WhatsApp account. Police have sent the suspect’s phones to forensic labs to check how many people were targeted in this way.Deputy commissioner of police (cyber cell) KPS Malhotra said Degri and his accomplices were operating from Delhi and Bengaluru. “We started probing this case after receiving a complaint from a person whose cell phone was hacked by some unknown persons. After taking control of the complainant’s WhatsApp account, they started demanding money from people in the contact list by sending distress messages. The suspects also blackmailed the person after gaining control of the data on the phone... We registered a case and started probe,” he said.DCP Malhotra clarified that the app was not hacked. “The data on the app is safe but if the phone is hacked, it is like giving the control of the phone to another person.”DCP Malhotra said that technical surveillance led investigators to the suspect, Degri, who was traced to a house in west Delhi’s Mohan Garden.“In all, 15 mobile phones and one laptop have been seized from his possession. The seized laptop showed that they used applications used to design various malware links... The accused used to create dedicated apps for each victim which when downloaded and installed on the victim’s phone, will send the Contacts, Call Logs and SMSs to their server, from where they could access his phone,” he added.Police said Degri and his associates would demand ₹5,000-50,000 from the victims.A WhatsApp spokesperson did not respond to requests seeking comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/cyber-fraud-uses-malware-to-hack-phones-via-messaging-apps-delhi-police-101635793897463.html
02-11-2021||Delhi||Two shot dead in separate incidents in Delhi||Two men were shot dead within half an hour of each other in south and southwest Delhi on Sunday night. Both the crimes were captured on CCTV camera footage, police said.In the first case, a 52-year-old hotel owner was shot dead allegedly over a financial dispute in south Delhi’s Mahipalpur close to Delhi airport on Sunday night, police said. Deputy police commissioner (southwest) Gaurav Sharma said the police control room received a call from a person saying someone shot his brother in Mahipalpur. A police team reached the spot and rushed the injured man to a nearby private hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival.“The deceased was identified as Krishan Pal Sehrawat, a 52-year-old resident of Gurugram. He had a gunshot injury near his left temple,” said Sharma.During the preliminary investigation, Sharma said, police found that Sehrawat had leased out his hotel, Dolphin International, to a person named Roshan Mishra about 10 months ago.“Sehrawat was disputing pending electricity bills and non-payment of the lease amount with Mishra. Mishra and his associates are the prime suspects. Efforts are on to trace them,” he added.The police said that the two parties had an altercation over a pending payment of nearly ₹5 lakh last week as well. Sehrawat asked Mishra to vacate his property if he was not willing to pay. The issue was sorted out at the time as Mishra agreed to clear the dues soon. However, he failed to do so and Sehrawat came to the hotel on Sunday night to confront Mishra, said a police officer associated with the case.“Mishra invited Sehrawat inside the hotel and also offered him alcohol. But Sehrawat was miffed and he started demanding the money. An altercation broke out between them and they walked out of the hotel. Mishra was accompanied by three associates. During the altercation, one of the four men whipped out a gun and shot Sehrawat in the temple before fleeing. Sehrawat collapsed and died,” said the officer.Sehrawat’s son, Siddharth Sehrawat, told reporters that after retiring from the Indian Air Force, his father constructed the hotel and leased it out to Mishra. “Except Mishra, my father never had any dispute with anyone. I also fear for my life. I am still in shock,” Siddharth told reporters.Police said that raids were being conducted to nab the suspects.In the second case, two unidentified motorcycle-borne assailants shot and killed a 22-year-old auto-rickshaw driver, Rahul (known by his first name) while he was waiting for someone near Zamrudpur traffic signal. The alleged attackers fled the crime scene but the incident was captured on CCTV cameras. Police said that the three suspects have been apprehended and are being interrogated to ascertain their role and motive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/two-shot-dead-in-separate-incidents-in-delhi-101635793890266.html
02-11-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana farmers line up at Kaithal police post to get DAP, block highway||Soon after getting reports of recovery of around 300 bags of DAP fertiliser by the police, hundreds of farmers lined up outside a police post in Kaithal city to get the fertiliser.Following complaints of farmers that a truck of DAP was being taken by a dealer, a police team took the truck into their possession and brought it to the police post for distribution among farmers who were protesting non-availability of DAP.“We had informed the police and officials of the agriculture department about the truck carrying over 300 bags of DAP being sent to a dealer, later police brought the truck to the police post and the DAP was distributed among the protesters,” local farm leader Satpal Singh said.Officials of the agriculture department said the recovered DAP belonged to a dealer in Kalayat who had provided all related documents but to avoid confrontation with farmers, the DAP was distributed among the farmers.Kaithal SDO Satish Nara said the recovered DAP was legal and it should be sent to the private dealer in Kalayat. Now it will be sold to farmers at Kaithal and the money will be sent to the dealer concerned.Kaithal deputy director (agriculture) Karam Chand said shortage of the DAP was due to early sowing of wheat but the supply of DAP has been increased and there will be no shortage of DAP in the next two-three days.He said around two lakh bags of DAP has been provided to farmers against the required four lakh bags.Earlier, the farmers had protested by blocking Pehowa Chowk of Kaithal demanding the administration to increase the supply of DAP. The farmers alleged that the government was not able to supply the DAP even though the sowing season is at its peak.Similar protest was reported in Karnal’s Assandh town as farmers associated with the BKU (Charuni) blocked the Kaithal-Assandh highway.The protesting farmers alleged that the government was unable to supply the required DAP and farmers were facing problems for the past one week. Later, following assurance from the authorities, the farmers lifted the blockade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-farmers-line-up-at-kaithal-police-post-to-get-dap-block-highway-101635793830323.html
02-11-2021||Delhi||Of five new dengue victims in Delhi, four are under 18, say officials||Four out of the five persons who died due to dengue between the end of September and October in Delhi were children, according to government data. The five deaths took the official toll in the national Capital to six this year, the highest since 2017 when the mosquito-borne disease claimed 10 lives.In comparison, there was only one dengue death in New Delhi last year, two in 2019 and four in 2018, according to official data. In 2015, a major dengue outbreak killed 60 people.This year, the infection claimed the lives of a six-year-old boy from Tri Nagar on October 15, a 17-year-old boy from Pitampura on October 16, a 14-year-old boy from West Punjabi Bagh on October 23, and a 9-year-old boy from Rangpuri Pahari on September 9. A 27-year-old man from Punjabi Bagh also died of dengue on October 20. Two weeks ago, the death of a 35-year-old woman from Delhi in September was the first to be recorded in the official toll.This year, 34 deaths were reported to the committee, of which 25 have been investigated. The committee is yet to examine nine more deaths, which is likely to drive up the toll further. Once a dengue death is reported by a hospital, an expert committee audits all documents to see whether it was indeed the infection that killed the person and whether the origin of the case was in Delhi. 
02-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Girl falls into tank, dies; parents say landlord tried to hush up death||An eight-year-old girl died on Saturday after she allegedly fell into an open underground water tank at a building in south-west Delhi’s Kapashera, where she lived with her parents and three siblings in a rented room, police said on Monday.The girl’s parents have alleged that their landlord tried to cover up the incident by asking them not to inform the police about it as doing so would mean that their daughter’s body will be “cut open” for autopsy. They also alleged that the landlord stopped them from taking the girl’s body out of the tank and tried to frighten them that the police would arrest them for killing their daughter. He offered them financial help and assistance in cremating the body, they alleged. However, the girl’s mother informed the police after which the landlord fled. The police then fished out the body from the water tank.Although the family has not alleged any foul play in her death or raised suspicions of a sexual assault, the police are waiting for the autopsy report to ascertain the exact cause of death and if she was sexually assaulted.According to the police, around 2.30pm Saturday, the eight-year-old girl went to use the toilet in the rear of the house where she lived with her parents and siblings. Her parents, who work as tailors in a factory in Gurugram, panicked when she did not return till 4pm. They launched a search for her in the neighbourhood and around 6pm, they found the girl’s slipper floating in the underground tank.“We alerted our neighbours and one of them suspected that our daughter may have fallen into the tank that is nearly 11-foot deep. All of us started emptying the tank using buckets and two water motors. When the water level receded after nearly three hours, a neighbour entered the tank and his feet hit our daughter’s body. In the meantime, the landlord arrived and asked everyone to leave; he said the body was not inside the tank,” said the girl’s father.The father alleged that the landlord switched off all the lights and locked the main gate so that no outsider could enter. The landlord allegedly offered money and told the parents that the body will be taken out only if they agreed not to inform the police. But around 10pm, the girl’s mother secretly informed the police and by the time the police arrived, the landlord had fled, the father alleged.“No foul play has been reported in the matter. A case has been registered based on the allegations made by the family,” said deputy commissioner of police (south-west) Gaurav Sharma.Police said the present case is similar to the one reported in August from the Delhi Cantonment, wherein a nine-year-old girl was allegedly raped and killed by a priest and three employees of a crematorium, who then cremated her body allegedly without her parents’ consent or the police being informed. Her parents had alleged that the accused, who are presently in jail, tried to hush up the matter by telling them that she was electrocuted while fetching water from the water cooler. The parents had also alleged that the four men prevented them from involving the police in that matter and also offered them money to remain silent. A charge-sheet has been filed in that case, which had triggered widespread outrage and condemnation and the family was later visited by several politicians, including Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhigirl-falls-into-tank-dies-parents-say-landlord-tried-to-hush-up-death-101635793650229.html
02-11-2021||Delhi||Gangster accused of 7 murders stabs and kills fellow inmate in Delhi jail||On Friday afternoon, in ward number 3 of Delhi’s Mandoli jail, a 39-year-old prisoner was stabbed in the head, allegedly by two prisoners, and the man succumbed to injuries the following day at the Guru Teg Bahadur hospital.The prisoner who stands accused of the murder is Vicky Pehalwan alias Raghunath, 29, one of western Uttar Pradesh’s most wanted gangsters until his arrest in March 2020. Since then, he has gained notoriety among prison inmates as the man with the maximum number of murder cases against him — jail officers say the killing of the 39-year-old undertrial prisoner Manjeet alias Manu is the eighth such case against Raghunath in the past five years. According to the jailers, Raghunath and his accomplice Imran alias Golu used a knife, improvised from a tin sheet, to grievously wound Manjeet. Records on the status of these cases were not immediately available for verification, but jailers said these murders took place in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh.According to these officers, even a dreaded Delhi gangster such as Jitender Gogi, who was shot dead by his rivals inside a courtroom at the Rohini district courts on September 24 had six murder cases against him. Gogi’s associate Kuldeep Fazza, a gangster who died in a police encounter on March 28, 2020, had five murders against him. But the total cases in which they were involved (including robbery, attempted murder, extortion and arms) were more compared to Pehalwan, which put them at the top of teh Delhi Police’s most wanted list. Following Friday’s murder, prison officers have shifted Raghunath to a high-security ward within the prison. Police investigation has revealed that Raghunath planned Manjeet’s murder for two reasons – Manjeet had stabbed Raghunath’s friend Jojo (identified only by his first name) inside Tihar last year and Manjeet also bullied Imran inside Mandoli jail. Officers of the Delhi Police special cell, who arrested him in March 2020, said Raghunath is a key member of Ankit Gujjar-Rohit Chaudhary gang. Gujjar, 29, one of western Uttar Pradesh’s most wanted men, was allegedly beaten to death by prison officers inside jail 3 on August 3. The prison department informed the court that Gujjar and two others were injured in a scuffle that broke out after jail officers confiscated a cellphone, data cable, and a knife from Gujjar’s cell. The Gujjar-Chaudhary gang of south Delhi and western Uttar Pradesh is involved in cases of extortion, murders, robbery and contract killings, among other heinous crimes, the police said.“Raghunath is hot-headed even within the gang and he is a resident of Muradnagar in Ghaziabad. We found his involvement in seven murder cases when we arrested him from the Mehrauli-Gurgaon Road on March 6, 2020. He then told us that he comes from a poor family and was introduced to Gujjar by a mutual friend in 2014. After Gujjar’s death, he became the de facto head of the gang along with jailed gangster Rohit Chaudhary,” said a police officer, who asked not to be named.Delhi Police officers who have questioned Raghunath in the past said both Gujjar and Rohit gang used Raghunath as their hitman.According to the police, Raghunath was involved in the murder of gangster Prince Chaudhary outside Saket mall on May 6, 2019. Prince, who was Rohit’s main rival, was shot dead allegedly by Raghunath and others, at the bidding of Rohit Chaudhary and Gujjar.“Gujjar again took Raghunath’s help to murder his political rival and local BJP leader Vinod Pandit, during the panchayat elections in Baghpat, Uttar Pradesh, on July 19,2019. It is difficult to reform prisoners like Raghunath,”said a Delhi Police officer, asking not to be named.But prisons expert Sunil Gupta, who worked as the law officer in Tihar jail for over three decades, disagree.“The jail officers have two responsibilities — safety of prisoners and their rehabilitation. If the man has murdered eight people so far, then he should be shifted to a high security prison where he does not get to interact with other inmates. Secondly, they should counsel and advise him to join a vipassana or meditation. It works in most cases. For those lodged in terror cases, we took the help of experts to “de-radicalise” them,” said Gupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/gangster-accused-of-7-murders-stabs-and-kills-fellow-inmate-in-delhi-jail-101635793530289.html

Delhi is faring worse, with only 9% of the total complaints (26 of 277) resolved so far. According to CPCB data, between October 15 and October 30, only 47 of 424 complaints were resolved by agencies in Delhi and NCR cities in Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. The data shows that in Delhi, the north corporation received the most complaints so far (103); however, it has only been able to resolve two of these complaints during this period. This is followed by the south corporation, which received 88 complaints between October 15 and October 30, but was only able to resolve two. The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) and the east corporation received 20 complaints each, resolving one and seven complaints respectively. Among the Delhi agencies that failed to resolve a single complaint so far are the Delhi Police, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) and the Flood Control Department. A senior CPCB official said most complaints are related to dust violations, construction and demolition waste and instances of open-waste burning. “Daily reports are being collected and compiled now. Data is being updated in realtime as each complaint gets resolved. Agencies have already been asked to ensure pendency rate remains low and teams on the ground can resolve pollution-related complaints in a matter of days,” said the official. Meanwhile, according to CPCB data, agencies in Haryana have dealt with 15 out of 86 air pollution-related complaints, while none of the 12 complaints in Rajasthan has been resolved so far.

The protesters gheraoed the building and symbolically locked its gates.Vikas Goel, the leader of Opposition in North Delhi Municipal Corporation alleged the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled municipal corporation has not paid current employees their salaries and retired employees their pension for the last three months. “How will MCD employees celebrate Diwali without salary? When preparations for festivals are going on in everyone’s house, there is not even a grain of ration left in the house of MCD employees. How will employees celebrate Diwali without pay?” Goel asked.Manoj Tyagi, the leader of Opposition in East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) said that workers engaged in cleaning Delhi are unable to light stoves in their houses. “AAP demands that if the BJP-led MCD is not able to pay salaries to the employees, then the people of the BJP should resign immediately,” he said.Prem Chauhan, the leader of Opposition in South Delhi Municipal Corporation said that if the BJP can’t run the municipal corporations and pay municipal employees, then it should learn from the AAP.BJP functionaries in the municipal corporations, in turn, blamed the Delhi government for the delay in disbursing salaries. Shyam Sunder Aggarwal, the EDMC mayor, said that the civic body has a pending payment of ₹ 525 crore in tax share allocation. “Salaries for September have been released for sanitation workers on a priority basis but remain pending for Group A, B, and C employees. We never faced delays in payment of our tax share during the Sheila Dikshit government,” he added.Jogi Ram Jain, standing committee chairman in the north corporation, said that the salary of all the employees and pension of retired employees have been released till the month of August, while the salary of safai karamcharis has been released till September. “The salary and pension for the month of September will be released to all the employees and retired employees very soon,” Jain said. “We are paying salaries to the employees through our own sources. Transfer duty of ₹61 crore for the month of August and ₹84 crore for the month of September for the north corporation are due. If the Aam Aadmi Party releases the due funds of the corporations, then the problem of salaries of employees will be completely resolved,” Jain said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aap-holds-protest-over-non-payment-of-salaries-to-civic-employees-in-delhi-101635793354553.html

Similarly, timely release of payment for material is critical for the creation of tangible and durable assets under MGNREGA,” he wrote. Last week, hundreds of MGNREGA workers in Sambalpur district staged a rally at Keshaibahal demanding quick payment of their wages.While the daily wage fixed by the RD ministry for MGNREGS work per person is ₹207, the Odisha government pays ₹308 per day in 20 migration-prone blocks in the state. Additional 200 days of works have also been approved for these 20 blocks.In 2020-21, Odisha generated 20 crore person days’ of works, 81 per cent higher than the total person days of work created in 2019-20 financial year on account of migrants who had stayed back following the Covid lockdown. In 2019-20, 11.14 crore person days’ of works were generated under the rural job scheme which provides for livelihood security by providing at least 100 days of guaranteed wage employment in every financial year to every rural household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work.In 2018-19, about 8.30 crore person days’ of works were generated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/odisha-cm-writes-to-pm-modi-for-increasing-nrega-labour-budget-101635793351242.html
02-11-2021||Chandigarh||Dr Surjit Singh takes over as PGIMER officiating director||Paediatrics department head Dr Surjit Singh took over as the officiating director of the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research here on Monday. The Union ministry of health and family welfare appointed him as officiating director after Dr Jagat Ram retired on Sunday after serving a tenure of four years and seven months.“Professor Surjit Singh has been given the charge for a period of six months or till such time a regular director is appointed, whichever is earliest”, the letter from the Union ministry read.After completing his MBBS from Maulana Azad Medical College, New Delhi, Dr Singh joined PGIMER as a resident doctor in 1984. He specialises in paediatric rheumatology, especially the Kawasaki disease, and primary immunodeficiency diseases.Speaking on the occasion, Dr Singh said, “PGIMER is facing the challenge of an increased patient load from other states. Emergencies are running at double their capacity, especially at a time when dengue and malaria cases are prevalent. Out-patient departments are also treating over 8,000 people per day.

02-11-2021||Lucknow||Jammu and Kashmir Students Assn seeks amnesty for three booked for sedition||Agra The Jammu and Kashmir Students Association wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday, seeking dropping of sedition charges and FIR against three Kashmiri students booked in Agra after they were allegedly found involved in posting pro-Pakistan chats on social media post the India -Pakistan match in T 20 World Cup on October 24. As per a press statement, the association also sought revoking their suspension from the college in Agra. National spokesperson of the association Nasir Khuehami said that the action against the Kashmiri students was totally arbitrary and unwarranted. “Sedition and FIR are very harsh punishments for their act and will ruin their careers and further alienate them. These harsh charges on the basis of mere WhatsApp chats will have serious consequences on their career and may lead to serious repercussions both in the long and short terms. Slapping sedition charges on them will put their career and the resources used by their parents for their education at stake,” Khuehami said. “The social media messages might have hurt the sentiment of people, but we need to reach out to them and counsel them rather than react with harsh decisions. No doubt they erred, but we hope that they will be given a chance to return to studies. Their future should not be destroyed in the larger interest of the country. The students who go to other states do so for serious studies. They have nothing to do with politics.” National general secretary of the association Younus Rashid also said that the government should give the students a chance and sought amnesty for them. Rashid requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take immediate steps to resolve the issue on humanitarian grounds and take immediate steps to revoke sedition charges and FIR against the students, so that their future was saved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/jammu-and-kashmir-students-assn-seeks-amnesty-for-three-booked-for-sedition-101635792815276.html
02-11-2021||Mumbai||Pained that my family is being harassed: Former Maharashtra minister Anil Deshmukh||Former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmumh, who on Monday appeared before the Enforcement Directorate (ED) following summons by the agency, has questioned the whereabouts of former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh. Deshmukh said that he was “pained” that he was being grilled on the allegations levelled by an officer, who according to the media reports, has “fled the country”. Stating that the allegations levelled by Singh against him are baseless, Deshmukh also said that it was not true that he was evading the probe by the central agencies. “All that I have ever sought is a transparent, fair and objective probe without any fear or favour so that truth is not rendered a casualty,” read a statement released by the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader. “Param Bir Singh levelled allegations against me after he was removed as the [police] commissioner of Mumbai and not when he was on that post. Former API (assistant police inspector) Sachin Vaze levelled [extortion] allegations only after I initiated the process of his termination from the service. Vaze is facing murder charges and is being probed by NIA (National Investigation Agency) in the Antilia explosives scare. Vaze was behind the bars on many occasions in the past as well. He was a trusted aide of Singh and levelled allegations against me on his behest. The central agencies are investigating against me and my family on the allegations levelled by people, of which one has fled the country and the other is facing serious charges. My family members are being harassed and it pains me a lot,” Deshmukh said in a pre-recorded video message put out on Twitter. “Whenever I received ED summons, I had informed them that I have moved the Bombay high court (HC) and the Supreme Court (SC) and would appear before them after the ruling by the courts. I had appeared before the CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation) twice. My case is still pending before SC, but as it is likely to delay, I appeared before ED today,” he further said. Stating that Singh is in Belgium, Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam has questioned who is behind facilitating the Indian Police Service (IPS) officer’s safe passage. “According to the information I received from my sources, Singh is in Belgium and fled the country through Nepal. The central agencies should throw more light on this. The question is how did he flee and who helped him in doing so. The central agencies should answer these questions. If the Centre is claiming that our borders are safe and fool proof, how can a person facing five cases flee the country? According to my information, Singh has a house in London and his family lives there. The Centre should coordinate with the Interpol to bring him back,” said the former parliamentarian. In March, Singh had written to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, alleging that Deshmukh had asked crime branch officers to collect ₹100 every month from establishments. IPS officer Rashmi Shukla, who was the intelligence department chief, had submitted a report last August to the state government over the alleged exchange of money for police transfers. Taking the cognisance of Singh’s allegations, HC had ordered a preliminary inquiry by CBI against Deshmukh, while ED is probing money laundering charges against the ex-minister. “Deshmukh appeared before ED only after he failed to get respite from courts. A bigger question here is why were leaders from all three ruling parties (Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress) trying to save the former home minister. Perhaps they fear that the inquiry will reveal the names of the ruling parties’ leaders who were equally involved in the collection of the ₹100-crore. We firmly believe that the truth will come to the fore in the inquiry,” said Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Ram Kadam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pained-that-my-family-is-being-harassed-former-maharashtra-minister-anil-deshmukh-101635792691045.html

02-11-2021||Delhi||3 yrs after fire, Delhi HC asks cracker unit owner to pay ₹34L as compensation||New Delhi: Three years after a fire at a cracker unit in Bawana killed 17 people, the Delhi high court has directed the factory owner to deposit ₹34 lakh with the authorities as compensation for families of the victims. Justice Prathiba M Singh said that the amount should be deposited with the Commissioner of Employees’ Compensation Act of north-east district in two instalments, by November and January.“The deposit and release of the amounts are being directed to provide some succour to the families of the victims who lost earning members. One of the victims was a 13-year-old girl. The above deposits shall be subject to further orders in the present petition,” the court said.The order comes while hearing a plea by the factory’s owner Manoj Jain, challenging the notices issued by the commissioner of Employees’ Compensation Act on January 21, 2018, directing him to pay the computed compensation amounts to the legal heirs of the employees who died in the 2018 incident.As per the application for condonation of delay, the petitioner attributed the delay in filing a writ petition challenging the commissioner’s order to his former lawyer who reportedly asked him to focus on the criminal trial, which is going on in a lower court, as it is “more important” than the proceedings under the Employees’ Compensation Act, since it’s a “civil case”.The total delay in filing the writ petition is more than 1,100 days, as per the petitioner, but over 1,900 days, according to the Delhi government. In an order on October 25, the court said that the delay in filing the petition by the factory owner shall be condoned and the interim order of no coercive action shall continue subject to the ₹34 lakh being deposited. It also directed the commissioner to ensure ₹2 lakh each is released to the legal heirs of the victims.At least 17 workers died and two others were injured in the fire which took place on January 20, 2018, following which an FIR was lodged under the sections of the Indian Penal Code and Explosives Act.During the hearing, the petitioner’s counsel informed the court that in the course of the criminal trial, a sum of ₹34 lakh was already deposited by Jain’s son in 2018, who was earlier arrested and granted bail by a trial court on the condition of depositing the money.The court was informed by the counsel for the Delhi government and some of the victims that they learned of two more incidents of fire in other firms associated with the factory owner.The high court said under such circumstances and considering the delay in the present case, some conditions will be liable to be imposed for the continuation of the interim order -- preventing coercive action against Jain -- and condonation of delay.The court made it clear that if the deposits are not made by the petitioner, the application seeking condonation of delay shall automatically stand dismissed and that the writ petition challenging the commissioner’s notice will be dismissed without any further orders.It also directed the commissioner to file a status report concerning the directions before the next date of hearing on February 10 next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/3-yrs-after-fire-delhi-hc-asks-cracker-unit-owner-to-pay-34l-as-compensation-101635792573869.html
02-11-2021||Other||Orissa High Court allows dealers to sell green crackers||Orissa High Court on Monday allowed firecracker sellers across the state to sell green crackers (ones that don’t emit much noise and gas and have reduced the size of shell) ahead of Diwali, officials said. However, this comes with a number of preconditions including burning of crackers between 8 and 10 pm and selling by dealers and retailers authorised by the Petroleum and Explosive Safety Organization, the nodal agency for regulating the safety of hazardous substances such as explosives, compressed gases and petroleum.Disposing of a writ petition by the All Odisha Firecrackers Dealers Association, that sought relaxation on the ban of the sale of firecrackers imposed by the Odisha government, a division bench of chief justice S Muralidhar and justice BP Routray ruled that the orders passed by Odisha’s Special Relief Commissioner, after meeting the firecracker dealers association on sale and use of green firecrackers that conform to the definition and formulation as proposed by CSIR-NEERI, would be followed.This year, Diwali would be celebrated across the country on November 4.“Sale and use of other fireworks would be completely banned. The sale and use of joined firecrackers (series crackers or laris) would also remain banned. Only those traders/dealers who obtain and produce a certificate from the PESO, after due inspection of their existing stock, certifying that the green fireworks stocks in their possession conform to the definition and formulation proposed by the CSIR-NEERI and are genuine would be allowed to sell their products,” the HC ruled quoting the SRC’s order on October 31.Earlier, the HC asked the Special Relief Commissioner to take an appropriate decision over the contentious issue keeping in mind the directives of the Supreme Court and the National Green Tribunal on the sale of firecrackers. The SRC then passed an order on October 31 after meeting the firecracker dealers.Quoting from the guidelines issued by the SRC, the HC ordered that authenticated copy of the PESO certificategranted to the dealers after due inspection of existing stocks lying in possession of the traders/dealers would bedeposited with the district administration/police commissioner for getting permission to sell the green fireworks.Traders/dealers who fail to obtain and produce the certificate from PESO would not be allowed to sell their products. “Mere labelling of fireworks boxes as “green fireworks” and providing QR codes would not entitle any trader/dealer to sell the same. Only those retailers who obtain a license from the authorities concerned under the provisions of the Indian Explosive Act, 1884 would be allowed to sell green fireworks, the HC said.As per PESO, green crackers are fireworks/firecrackers with reduced size of shell, minimum ash usage and reduced usage of raw materials in the compositions and use of additives as dust suppressants to reduce emissions with specificreference to particulate matter. The green crackers have a minimum of 30 per cent reduction in particulate matter compared to routine crackers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/orissa-high-court-allows-dealers-to-sell-green-crackers-101635792572518.html

02-11-2021||Delhi||Nearly 35% of dengue cases detected last week in Delhi ‘untraced’||Delhi municipal corporations’ weekly report regarding vector-borne diseases showed that 184 of 531, or 34.65%, dengue cases detected last week were “untraced”. The comparative statement of dengue cases in Delhi for the week ending October 30, issued by the anti-malaria operations (headquarters) at South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC), said that the hospitals did not have addresses/contacts for at least 100 dengue patients in the city. The eighty-four other patients who could not be traced were not hospitalised and had not provided their addresses/contacts to the labs testing their blood samples either.“While doing a follow-up of the infected patients, we find that many of the mobile numbers or the addresses provided by patients at the time of pathological tests are false. If we can’t reach them on these addresses or numbers during investigation, we declare these patients ‘untraced’,” Dr BK Hazarika, medical health officer, SDMC, said. Additionally, the report said 418 of these cases were “acquired infections from other states”.Explaining what acquired infections are, Dr Hazarika said, “Prima facie, we classify patients as Delhi and non-Delhi residents to identify who was infected with dengue here and who got infected from other states.” After investigation, those found to have been infected in other states are classified as “acquired infections”, he added.He also said that the municipal health staff regularly conducts awareness drives about the steps to be taken to prevent the breeding of malaria (Anopheles) and dengue (Aedes aegypti) mosquitoes. “To control the spreading of mosquito-borne diseases, domestic breeding checkers have arranged 23 million house visits till October 30 this year. They have sprayed insecticides at 2.8 million houses this year”. The report also said that 1,537 dengue cases were reported in Delhi till October 30. Delhi had reported 1,069 cases in 2019 and 612 in 2020. “Of the 531 cases detected last week, the maximum number of cases--134-- was detected in the areas under the jurisdiction of North Delhi Municipal Corporation, followed by 127 and 69 in areas under the jurisdiction of the south and east municipal bodies, respectively. Eight cases were detected in areas under the jurisdiction of the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC), five cases were detected in the Delhi cantonment, and four cases were detected in areas under the jurisdiction of the railways,” it stated. When contacted, Mukesh Suryan, the mayor of the SDMC – the nodal agency that releases the data of vector-borne diseases, said that no death due to dengue has taken place in either of the two hospitals, i.e. Purnima Sethi and Tilak Nagar. “We are doing the best to tackle this disease by repeated fogging and awareness drives in different wards. But, the onus of all six deaths recorded in Delhi so far this year lies on the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)-ruled Delhi government. Despite a huge surge in dengue cases this year, we don’t have any funds to tackle this situation. Even if the dengue victims were not Delhi residents, it was the responsibility of the state government to save their lives,” he said. Refuting Suryan’s allegations, Prem Chouhan, the leader of the Opposition in SDMC, said that it’s the responsibility of the municipal bodies, to control the vector-borne diseases in their areas. “But the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled municipal bodies want to hide all their failures, blaming the Kejriwal government. Neither do they want to perform, nor do they let others perform. Forget about government, every worker of our party is ensuring repeated fogging in all critical areas,” he said. Abhishek Dutt, the Congress leader and Andrews Ganj councillor, accused both BJP and AAP of the failure in tackling the spread of dengue in Delhi. “The fact is that neither of these parties can turn their back on their responsibilities. Instead of diverting the attention of the people with their catfight, they must perform at the ground level for the people’s suffering,” he said.He also alleged that the civic bodies are trying to “control” the number of dengue cases by “leaving cases untraced”. “Is it possible to have untraced cases in a world where everything is driven by technology? Both AAP and BJP are trying to hoodwink people with their blame game... instead of providing proper healthcare facilities,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/nearly-35-of-dengue-cases-detected-last-week-in-delhi-untraced-101635792210222.html
02-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt launches training centre to rehabilitate beggars in the Capital||The Delhi government launched a training centre and skill development centre on Monday to help persons who make their living by begging, while social welfare minister Rajendra Pal Gautam shared the findings of a government survey, which identified 20,719 individuals as “persons engaged in the act of begging”.“The Kejriwal government is now preparing a strategy to rehabilitate beggars in Delhi. Our aim is to make Delhi begging-free... The Delhi government will ensure and provide skill training to persons engaged in begging so that they can find economic opportunities in mainstream society,” said Gautam during the launch of the training and skill development centres at the Delhi Secretariat.In February 2021, the department of social welfare in collaboration with the Institute for Human Development conducted on-ground surveys to identify persons engaged in the act of begging (PEAB), the government said in a statement.“In the survey, around 20,719 people were identified as PEAB in Delhi. Out of the total, 53% (10,987) were men, 46% (9,541) were women across 11 districts. One per cent (191) were transgenders. The highest number of PEAB were in East Delhi (2,797),” said Gautam, citing the findings of the survey.He added: “Poverty, along with many other factors, results in a person resorting to begging. People are forced into begging because of their social and economic circumstances. They are the most vulnerable section of society. Keeping this in mind, we conducted a pilot survey to identify such persons and simultaneously formulate a plan through which they can be rehabilitated.”“The department of social welfare in Delhi government has started the ‘integrated programme for the rehabilitation of beggars in Delhi’. The objective of this program is to make Delhi a begging-free city by rehabilitating beggars and also providing them with opportunities for training and skill development so that they can find jobs in the mainstream economy. The aim of the project is to create a sustainable model for rehabilitating and settlement of persons engaged in the act of begging,” the government statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-launches-training-centre-to-rehabilitate-beggars-in-the-capital-101635791910182.html
02-11-2021||Delhi||Ex-chief secy challenges clean chit to Delhi CM, Sisodia in assault case||A Delhi court on Monday sought the response of the chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, his deputy Manish Sisodia and nine Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLAs on a plea by former chief secretary Anshu Prakash, challenging the clean chit given to them in an alleged assault on him.Additional sessions judge Geetanjali Goel issued notice to Kejriwal, Sisodia and the MLAs, and posted the matter for further hearing on November 23.On August 11, a city court had exonerated Kejriwal, Sisodia and nine AAP MLAs who were accused of allegedly assaulting Prakash during a midnight meeting in 2018, saying that there was no “criminal conspiracy” and “unlawful assembly”.The court said that the incident happened suddenly, after some of the MLAs started questioning Prakash over some issues and in the spur of the moment, two of the MLAs — Amanatullah Khan and Parkash Jarwal — allegedly hit him, without any conspiracy, prior meeting of minds or pre-meditation.The judge, however, had framed charges against the Khan and Jarwal for obstructing a public servant on duty, assaulting him and voluntarily causing hurt to Prakash, taking note of the statement of CM’s advisor VK Jain.Challenging the decision of the magistrate on Monday, Prakash, in his plea through senior advocate Siddharth Luthra, has contended that the trial court has conducted a “fishing and roving enquiry” into the allegations in the charge sheet, and has drawn erroneous inferences and conclusions without having the benefit of examination of the prosecution witnesses.“...that the trial court even while selectively relying on and considering the material available on record has arrived at divergent findings qua the accused persons, without any basis or justification, by applying different yardstick for different accused in relation to their role and involvement in the crime,” the plea said.It also said that the trial court had failed to appreciate the fact that the meeting was called at midnight, which was very unusual as there was no emergency.“The trial court has failed to appreciate the genesis of the entire case including the preceding and subsequent events of the incident wherein the complainant (Prakash) under a well-planned conspiracy was physically assaulted and intimidated as he was not giving in/agreeing to illegal directions to issue the TV advertisements (for the occasion AAP government completing three years) in violation of the guidelines of Supreme Court,” the plea added.In his complaint to the police in February, 2018, Prakash had alleged that Kejriwal, Sisodia and 11 AAP MLAs had assaulted him in a midnight meeting called by the CM’s advisor, VK Jain, to discuss release of the party’s advertisements related to the government completing three years in Delhi.Prakash alleged that he was manhandled and assaulted in the course of the meeting which was called to discuss the release of the party’s advertisements related to the government completing three years in Delhi.Police had later filed a charge sheet against Kejriwal, Sisodia and 11 AAP MLAs for offences including criminal conspiracy, assaulting a public servant, threatening to cause death or grievous injury, and wrongful confinement, among other sections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/exchief-secy-challenges-clean-chit-to-delhi-cm-sisodia-in-assault-case-101635791850133.html

Officials said that the gang also provided solvers who would appear in place of the actual candidates in various recruitment exams in exchange for money.Kumar Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police, Noida, said the Sector 58 police received information that the gang members would be gathering near a park in Noida’s Sector 61 early morning. “A team from the Sector 58 police station reached the spot and arrested 10 persons sitting in two cars,” he said. Police recovered ₹9.15 lakh in cash, two cheques of ₹2 lakh each, 28 admit cards of different examinations, a sample question paper of the Haryana Police constable exam, and 14 mobile phones from the suspects’ possession .Rajneesh Verma, assistant commissioner of police Noida (2), said that the suspects, Sunil Kumar and Satnam Singh, natives of Haryana, are retired subedar, while another suspect Lakhan Singh from Rajasthan is a retired army jawan. Lakhan was in contact with other suspects -- Umesh Tatwar, Abhinav Kumar, Layak, Virendra Yadav, Mahipal Yadav, Vikas Sharma and Jitendra Yadav, police said.“The suspects revealed that they had gathered to exchange information and cash. They used to leak the question papers and sold them to candidates. In some cases, the suspects used to impersonate in exams by forging documents of candidates,” Verma said. Suspect Jitendra Yadav was about to appear in the constable exam on Monday on behalf of a candidate, police said, adding that the gang had a large network spread across various states, including Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, and Bihar. They have fraudulently helped nearly 150 candidates get government jobs in the past 2.5 years. The preliminary investigation showed that the gang would charge ₹30 lakh per candidate, police said. A case has been registered against the suspects under sections 420 (cheating), 467 (forgery), 468 (forgery for the purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged document) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) at Sector 58 police station. “The suspects were produced in court that sent them to judicial custody,” Verma said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-cops-bust-gang-involved-in-leaking-exam-papers-10-held-101635791791343.html
02-11-2021||Noida||RRTS project: Ghaziabad station to act as major interchange hub||The future routes of the Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) to Khurja and Hapur in western Uttar Pradesh will branch out from the main Ghaziabad station, which is being constructed as part of the 82-km-long Delhi-Meerut RRTS project, officials said on Monday.The officials of the National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC), implementing agency of the RRTS project, said on Monday that eight routes were proposed, with three being prioritised, when the RRTS project -- which will have high-speed trains on dedicated tracks -- was conceptualised in 2006.“The design of the Ghaziabad RRTS station has been done in such a manner that it will pave the way for two future routes to Khurja and Hapur. Sufficient infrastructure is being constructed, including the loop lines at the Ghaziabad station, which will help us branch out more routes in the future as well,” said Puneet Vats, chief public relations officer (PRO) of NCRTC.The eight initially proposed corridors include Delhi-Meerut, Delhi-Alwar, Delhi-Panipat, Delhi-Palwal, Delhi-Khurja, Delhi-Rohtak, Delhi-Hapur and Delhi-Baraut, officials said, adding that the prioritised three corridors were slotted under Phase 1 of the RRTS project and the five other routes were identified under the Functional Plan on Transport for National Capital Region-2032.“The Ghaziabad RRTS station is being designed to act as a major interchange hub, and it will also have interchangeable facilities with the Metro. Besides, it will also act as an interchange station for other future routes,” Vats added.According to an estimation, the distance between Ghaziabad and Khurja is nearly 77 kilometres, and 34 kilometres between Ghaziabad and Hapur.Officials familiar with the development said that the Ghaziabad station -- which is nearly 27 metres in height and among the three prioritised corridors -- is the tallest among all the RRTS stations, will also have interchangeable facilities with the Metro.

Police officials said they will also sensitise people to follow traffic rules during the month-long drive. Police commissioner Alok Singh said that there is a need to inculcate a sense of road discipline in the mind of every commuter. “India has world’s 1% vehicles, but it records 11% global road accidents. We need to change our mindset and follow traffic rules strictly,” Singh said at the inaugural programme at commissionerate office in Sector 108.Ganesh Prasad Saha, deputy commissioner of police (traffic), Gautam Budh Nagar, said that police will take strict action against polluting vehicles. “We will impound diesel and petrol vehicles older than 15 and 10 years, respectively. We are also taking action against vehicles using modified silencers. Besides, we will encourage people to use e-vehicles,” he said. The district has 771,087 registered vehicles, of which 6,937 are e-vehicles, the officials said. “At present, the traffic police department has 565 personnel. We have added around 1,000 traffic volunteers,” the DCP said. Shreya Sharma, a resident of Noida’s Sector 50 and one of the traffic volunteers, said, “Every Sunday we conduct a traffic awareness programme at the neighbouring crossing. We also urge people to wear a helmet while riding motorcycles,” she said.Anurag Kulshrestha, president of TRAX, a road safety NGO, delivered a presentation at the inaugural programme and said that roads should have 360 degree visibility, proper lane marking, walkable footpath, proper merging of traffic, and easy emergency exit. “We have found that Noida roads lack these technical aspects which must be fixed,” Kulshrestha said. Some private companies also displayed their innovative models for traffic safety and smart policing during the programme. The police commissioner visited these stalls and interacted with their representatives. Abhishek Dwivedi, chief operating officer of EVeez, put up a stall to display e-bikes on subscription basis. “E-bikes are environment friendly and cheaper as compared to diesel and petrol vehicles. We found that some people do not want to buy such vehicles but want to ride them. We are offering these vehicles for a monthly rent,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-traffic-police-to-focus-on-enforcement-against-polluting-vehicles-101635791612679.html
02-11-2021||Noida||Air quality worsens in Noida, increase in mercury likely today||The air quality in Noida and Greater Noida worsened to the ‘very poor’ category on Monday, after oscillating between the ‘moderate’ and ‘poor’ categories for days.According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Noida recorded the air quality index (AQI) reading, on a scale of 0 to 500, on Monday at 301 against 292 a day earlier, and Greater Noida at 306 against 292 on Sunday.An AQI reading between 101 and 200 is considered ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and above 400 ‘severe’.According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), fire incidents have increased in the city, but the change in wind directions has helped in reducing the intrusion of smoke in the region. “Delhi’s AQI was recorded in the ‘very poor’ category on Monday, and it is likely to improve to the upper end of ‘poor’ in the next two days. This is due to the prevailing winds from west/southwest direction, and the reduction in transport of emissions from stubble burning. The share of crop residue burning emissions in PM2.5 is low, about 7% (effective fire count being 3,971) due to unfavourable wind for transport. The prevailing mixing layer height (MLH), which is shallow, reduces the dispersion of pollutants,” according to the Safar statement on Monday.The effective fire count (stubble burning) on Sunday was 3,971 against 1743 a day earlier, it added.Meanwhile, there was a slight drop in the daytime temperatures in Noida. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the maximum and minimum temperatures in Noida on Monday were recorded at 29 degrees Celsius (°C) and 14.2 degrees Celsius, respectively, against 29.2 degrees Celsius and 17.1 degrees Celsius, respectively, a day earlier.“The maximum and minimum temperatures in Noida will hover around 30 degrees Celsius and 15 degrees Celsius on Tuesday,” said an IMD official, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/air-quality-worsens-in-noida-increase-in-mercury-likely-today-101635791611456.html
02-11-2021||Noida||Greater Noida housing complex fined over ₹4L for violating waste management norms||The Greater Noida authority has imposed a penalty of ₹4.03 lakh against the Eco Village One housing complex in Greater Noida’s Sector 1 for not following norms as mentioned in the Waste Management Rules 2016, said officials on Monday.It imposed the hefty penalty against the residential complex for not segregating and handling the waste, and dumping the same at undesignated sites, in complete violation of the waste management rules.According to the Waste Management Rules 2016, if a housing complex produces more than 100kg waste daily or is built on a 5,000-square-metre area or above, it will be considered as a “bulk waste producer” and will have to segregate and treat the waste at source. It will have to segregate dry, wet, and plastic waste separately, and treat the same according to the rules.“We have imposed a penalty of ₹4.03 lakh against the housing complex, as during an inspection, a team from the Greater Noida authority found that it had violated the waste rules. And if it continues to flout the rules, the authority will have to increase the penalty amount against it,” said Salil Yadav, in-charge of health department, Greater Noida authority.“Earlier, we had imposed a penalty of ₹2 lakh against the same housing complex in August 2021. If they continue to violate the waste norms, the penalty amount will keep increasing,” Yadav added.Supervisors Dr Umesh Chandra, Inder Nagar and Mudit Tyagi were also part of the authority teams which conducted the inspection at the residential complex.Narendra Bhooshan, chief executive officer (CEO) of Greater Noida authority, has directed its health department to conduct similar inspections and ensure that “bulk waste producers” across the city are keeping the norms in check. He has also appealed to the general public to support the authority in handling waste management in a better way.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/greater-noida-housing-complex-fined-over-4l-for-violating-waste-management-norms-101635791610225.html
02-11-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad ‘most polluted’ city for third time since October 15||The air quality index (AQI) in Ghaziabad has been worsening ahead of the festival of Diwali on Thursday (November 4 this year), with the city being listed as the “most polluted” one for the third time since October 15 this year, according to the Central Pollution Control Board on Monday.Ghaziabad was listed as the “most polluted city” on October 16 with the AQI recorded at 349 -- for the first time after the implementation of the graded response action plan (Grap) on October 15 this year, and on Friday (October 29) with the AQI at 321.The AQI figures released by the CPCB shows that Ghaziabad recorded the AQI at 363 -- the highest so far -- under the ‘very poor’ category, with the primary pollutants being PM10 and PM2.5.An AQI reading between zero and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.Officials of the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) said that they faced issues in streamlining data at two of the four monitoring stations. “We faced some technical issues at our two monitoring stations at Vasundhara and Loni, and morning figures were shown in the afternoon. So, we are adopting rectification measures. Our patrolling teams are also monitoring the air in industrial areas and construction sites regularly,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB.According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), Delhi’s AQI was recorded in the ‘very poor’ category on Monday, and it is likely to improve to the upper end of ‘poor’ in the next two days. This is due to the prevailing winds from west/southwest direction, and the reduction in transport of emissions from stubble burning.“The share of crop residue burning emissions in PM2.5 is low, about 7% (effective fire count being 3,971) due to unfavourable wind transport. The prevailing mixing layer height (MLH), which is shallow, reduces the dispersion of pollutants,” according to the Safar statement on Monday.Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist, said, “Instances of garbage burning and heavy traffic movement on roads have led to the spike in the particulate matter in the air. It seems that there is a lack of coordination among different agencies to act on this at the ground level. High volumes of traffic movement and snarls are leading to the increase in the pollution, too.”According to the Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi, Union Ministry of Earth Sciences, the air quality in Delhi-NCR is likely to be in the ‘poor’ to lower end of the ‘very poor’ category between November 2 and 3. “In the outlook for the subsequent five days, the air quality is likely to deteriorate significantly between November 5 and 6, and it may reach the upper end of the ‘very poor’ category. PM2.5 will be the predominant pollutant,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-most-polluted-city-for-third-time-since-october-15-101635791430045.html
02-11-2021||Gurugram||Will stop public namaz: Muslim body amid clamour from right-wing groups||Members of the Muslim community on Monday said that they have decided to stop offering Friday prayers (namaz) at an open site in Sector 12, which was designated by the district administration, to avoid confrontations with right-wing Hindu groups and ensure “harmonious” coexistence of all religions.Community leaders and members of the Haryana Waqf Board on Monday met the deputy commissioner and submitted a memorandum to the chief minister, offering to stop namaz in open spaces and requesting that officials concerned be directed to remove encroachments from mosques and land owned by the Waqf Board.Khurshhid Rajaka, a member of the Haryana Waqf Board, who is also the chairman of Muslim Rashtriya Manch, said that prayers cannot be conducted under the shadow of police protection every Friday. “Prayers being offered amid opposition and against the wishes of the people are not in tune with Islam and national unity. We don’t want our Hindu brothers to feel unhappy and resort to protests to disrupt our namaz,” Rajaka said.The Haryana Waqf Board has 19 land parcels in different areas of the Gururgam district, out of which at least 13 sites are encroached upon. Members of the Muslim community also demanded land in developing sectors for the construction of mosques.Rajaka alleged that the issue of namaz has been turned into a political issue to pitch one community against the other, and said that changes can be adopted to maintain peace.The development comes a day after members of a Hindu right-wing group announced that they would perform Govardhan Puja and organise a Bhandara (community kitchen) at the namaz site in Sector 12. Earlier, members of the Muslim community offered prayers at Sector 47, but following protests by residents, they were allotted a site in Sector 12A. However, the protests continued there as well.Members of right-wing organisations have been protesting against namaz being offered in the open since September. Following a memorandum submitted to the administration by a consortium of Hindu groups — demanding that the practice be stopped — on October 26, the police were deployed to protect those offering prayers last Friday.Last Friday, at least 35 people associated with different Hindu groups were detained by the police for trying to disrupt namaz in Sector 12A on Friday afternoon, as more than 500 officers were deployed at five designated namaz sites. No violence was reported and prayers were offered peacefully, the police said.Rajaka said they have submitted a list of the 19 Waqf Board sites and requested the administration to free the land parcels from encroachments. “We have requested the existing mosques, which are few in number, to conduct multiple rounds of prayers on Friday to accommodate as many people as possible,” he said.He said that individual members of the community have also offered their private plots for Friday prayers and that they may also choose to offer prayers at these sites provided locals do not have an issue with the same.Haji Shehzad Khan, the chairman of Muslim Ekta Manch, said that they have been taking up the issue on the behalf of the community since 2018, and now and then, the issue flares up due to which they have decided to permanently end the practice. “Misinformation is being spread that those 37 sites, designated in 2018, were for only one day, but actually, it was for one day a week,” said Khan.Khan said that they will cooperate with all the stakeholders concerned and offer prayers at the places identified by the authorities in consultation with all parties concerned.Meanwhile, officials of the Gurugram district administration acknowledged the receipt of a memorandum in this regard.Yash Garg, the deputy commissioner of Gururgam, said that they have received the memorandum and will come out with a solution at the earliest.KK Rao, the commissioner of police, said that the police are well prepared to prevent escalation of the law and order situation and they are equipped to protect those offering prayers at the designated sites. “We took strict action against those who tried to disrupt namaz and tried to give it into a communal issue,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/namaz-row-muslims-to-end-prayers-in-open-request-authorities-to-clear-encroachments-at-13-land-parcels-101635789990038.html

Therefore, there is no other option before the Commission but to suspend the hearing schedule till the government provides suitable accommodation to the Commission. Accordingly, the Commission hereby suspends all future hearings till the Government provides suitable accommodation at Mumbai”.The letter stated that the commission has informed the government about a proposed hearing scheduled from November 8-12, 2021.“In the meeting dated Oct 28, 2021, Chairman Justice JN Patel advised Saxena, principal secretary, Home Spl. to take the issue directly to the office of the Chief Minister and to get the suitable accommodation on an emergent basis. It was also made clear that if suitable accommodation is not provided by October 29, the commission would suspend its hearing schedules. Unfortunately, nothing was heard from the government till October 31 about availability of suitable accommodation”, the letter reads.The commission, according to its secretary, had informed the government that it had to postpone hearings scheduled in the last week of March and first week of April, 2020, due to the Covid-19 pandemic.“Further notifications were also kept on hold at the request of the Commission mainly due to Covid-19 pandemic. In its 7th Status report, the Commission has stated that it is likely to examine about 40 more witnesses and expects further extension of at least six months,” the letter stated.The two-member commission, headed by retired high court justice J N Patel, was constituted by the then state government under CM Devendra Fadnavis on February 9, 2018, to probe into the sequence of events that led to violence on the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Bhima Koregaon on January 1, 2018. The commission has six terms of reference, including identifying causes of the January 1, 2018 riots that took place in Pune, identifying responsible groups, determining whether police and administration were prepared, and recommending short and long-term measures.When contacted, commission secretary Palnitkar said, “We have informed the chief secretary about the suspension of further hearings due to lack of space.”The Elgar Parishad conclave was first held on December 31, 2017, at Pune’s historic Shaniwarwada, ahead of the 200th anniversary of the battle of Bhima Koregaon, which was observed on January 1, 2018. Clashes broke out between right-wing forces and Dalits near the Vijay Stambh (victory pillar) at Bhima Koregaon, located in Perne village on the Pune-Ahmednagar highway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/koregaon-bhima-commission-suspends-hearings-no-accommodation-101635785129594.html
02-11-2021||Mumbai||Former Maha CM protected drug peddlers, says Nawab Malik; Fadnavis hits back||Attacking the Bharatiya Janata Party and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, Maharashtra minister and senior Nationalist Congress Party(NCP) leader Nawab Malik on Monday tweeted pictures of Fadnavis and his wife, Amruta, with Jaydeep Rana, arrested in a drug peddling case.The minister said that people like Rana received protection under the previous government. Fadnavis, however, denied the allegations and said he will expose minister’s links with the Underworld after Diwali.In a series of tweets, Malik hit out at the former chief minister and the BJP. “Let’s have a discussion of links between BJP and drug peddler,” Malik said in a tweet with a photograph of Amruta Fadnavis and Rana. In another tweet, he posted a picture of Fadnavis with Rana.Rana was arrested in a drug peddling case in June this year and is currently lodged in a jail.“Jaydeep Rana is linked with Devendra ji. When Fadnavis was CM, his wife Amruta released the album in February 2018... It was directed by Sachin Gupta, creative head was Manish Khanka and finance head was Jaydeep Rana. Claims that anyone can take a picture when you are in public life will not work in this case. There is also another picture where both can be seen together during Ganesh Chaturthi, I don’t know who visited who’s residence then,” said Malik, later, at a press conference.Also Read: On Wankhede’s ‘clean chit’ by caste panel official, Nawab Malik’s objection“The matter is also not limited to this but is also related to a major drug business and Fadnavis’s role in the matter needs to be probed… We are not questioning pictures but funding of the album. We demand an investigation either through judicial commission or CBI,” Malik said.Hitting out at Malik, Fadnavis said that Rana has nothing to do with him and his wife and that he will expose Malik’s links with the underworld after Diwali. “Malik has levelled baseless allegations against me and my wife. The accused arrested a few days ago was engaged by River March for their social drive. We were just helping them in a social cause. The accused took pictures with me as well, but Malik is intentionally targeting my wife. It shows their culture,” Fadnavis told reporters. Responding to Malik’s allegations over Rana funding the album, Amruta Fadnavis said, “River March approached me for this project (Mumbai River anthem) for the rejuvenation of four Mumbai rivers which were reduced to nullahs. It was because of our efforts that the BMC took some steps for the rejuvenation... Instead of appreciating good work, we are being targeted,” she said. Devendra Fadnavis said that he will produce proof of Malik’s alleged underworld links before the media and NCP chief Sharad Pawar. “Those who have relations with the Underworld should not speak about me. I will present evidence of Nawab Malik’s relations with the Underworld. I am waiting for Diwali to pass,” the former chief minister said.Soon after Fadnavis’ allegations, Malik in a tweet in Hindi said, “We are ready”.“Malik is trying to pressurise the NCB by levelling allegations so that the charge sheet against his son-in-law is weakened. The NCB will not buckle under any pressure. The law will take its own course,” Fadnavis added.Malik’s son-in-law Sameer Khan was arrested by the NCB earlier this year in a drugs case and was later granted bail by a court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/malik-claims-link-between-fadnavis-and-drug-peddler-former-cm-hits-back-101635765988652.html

The duo met on the sidelines of the United Nations’ COP26 world leaders summit underway in Glasgow, Scotland.Addressing a special briefing on Modi's visit to Glasgow, foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said Deuba was thankful for India’s help in rebuilding houses, schools and several cultural sites after the earthquake."The Prime Minister of Nepal started by thanking the PM for the assistance that India had provided Nepal in post-earthquake relief -- the construction of 50,000 houses in the Gorkha district. A number of schools and hospitals and a number of cultural sites were restored, which were badly affected by the earthquake. He also spoke about the cross-border oil pipeline which connects part of India and Nepal and the utility of the pipeline," Shringla said."He also thanked the Prime Minister for providing vaccines in a timely manner to Nepal, including the one million doses that have just been supplied. He also invited PM Modi to visit Nepal at his earliest convenience," he added.Earlier in the day, Modi and his Nepalese counterpart noted the excellent cooperation between two countries during the pandemic, particularly through the supply of vaccines, and medical equipment from India to Nepal.The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), in a statement, said this was the first meeting of Modi with Deuba after a telephone conversation between the duo in July this year when the latter assumed office as the Prime Minister of Nepal."The two leaders noted the excellent cooperation between India and Nepal during the pandemic particularly through the supply of vaccines, medicines and medical equipment from India to Nepal as well as by ensuring the free flow of goods across the borders," the MEA said.Both leaders discussed ways to further strengthen bilateral cooperation including in the context of ongoing efforts against the COVID-19 pandemic.Ministry of external affairs spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said the leaders discussed the issue of climate change and Covid-19. "PM @narendramodi met PM of Nepal @SherBDeuba today. In their first engagement since PM Deuba assumed office, the two leaders discussed ways to further strengthen our close bilateral ties. Also discussed climate, COVID-19 & resolved to work together toward post-pandemic recovery," Bagchi said in a tweet.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-pm-deuba-thanks-modi-for-covid-vaccines-post-quake-aid-during-first-meet-101635871704209.html

He said the protocols and standards of this interoperability would be "some of the most difficult and most important policy work."Facebook on Tuesday announced new European partners in its XR Programs and Research Fund, a two-year, $50 million investment that it says will help it build the metaverse responsibly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebooks-metaverse-can-take-up-to-15-yrs-company-will-enhance-users-safety-and-privacy-says-senior-executive-101635870933658.html

While world leaders have gathered in Scotland, Xi sent a written response to the climate summit aimed at securing net-zero carbon emissions and keeping the Paris Agreement target of a 1.5 degrees Celsius temperature rise."As I understand it, the conference organisers did not provide the video link method," Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at a regular briefing.Xi’s physical absence at the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference was seen as China’s unwillingness to offer any more concessions during this round of talks. As per the expectation, China failed to offer any additional pledge to fight global warming and called on the parties to “build on exiting consensus, increase mutual trust” to deliver a successful COP26 in Glasgow.China argued that it has already made significant pledges including bringing emissions to a peak by 2060 and raising total solar and wind capacity to 1,200 gigawatts by 2030. Xi said in a statement that China will continue to prioritise ecological conservation and pursue a green and low-carbon path to development.“We will foster a green, low-carbon and circular economic system at a faster pace, press ahead with industrial structure adjustment, and rein in the irrational development of energy-intensive and high-emissions projects. We will speed up the transition to green and low-carbon energy, vigorously develop renewable energy, and plan and build large wind and photovoltaic power stations,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-jinping-sends-written-statement-to-cop26-china-alleges-video-link-not-provided-101635866737338.html

Therefore, I believe, for now, that the zero-transmission strategy is not too costly, but is in fact a relatively less costly method.”In a major outbreak in July-August, China counted a total of over 1,200 local infections.In the ongoing outbreak, mostly concentrated in northern China, 538 local cases have been reported between October 17 and November 1.The Chinese mainland on Monday reported 54 new locally transmitted Covid-19 cases, the national health commission (NHC) said in its daily report on Tuesday.Of the new local cases, the biggest number, 27, was reported in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang.Beijing, according to the Xinhua news agency, reported four new local Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, all from the same family, taking the total number in the latest resurgence to 35 including 33 confirmed ones and two asymptomatic carriers.The four cases were from Tiantongyuan, a neighbourhood in Beijing’s Changping district, reputed to be the largest residential area in Asia.“Their confirmation led the community where they live to be labelled as a medium-risk region for the epidemic. Some 142,700 residents living in the community and neighbouring streets were given nucleic acid tests starting on Tuesday morning. The mass test is likely to be completed on the same day,” the Global Times reported on Tuesday.Meanwhile, Shanghai’s Disneyland on Tuesday announced it will resume operations on Wednesday, November 3, 2021, after nearly 70,000 nucleic acid tests conducted on visitors and staff present at the resort over the weekend, returned negative.More than 33,000 visitors inside the park on Sunday were only allowed to leave after their Covid test results came negative as one confirmed patient had visited the resort on Saturday.The total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases on the mainland had reached 97,314 by Monday while 4,636 had died of the infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-won-t-give-up-on-zero-tolerance-covid-policy-soon-expert-101635858226567.html

I know these tapes exist & hope you have them. This z d time," Saleh said in his tweet.I call on @ashrafghani to release the tapes ( esp Jul/Aug) of the conversations with Khalilzad & other relevant foreign diplmts on peace process to counter the growing propaganda that it was & is all the Afghan fault. I know these tapes exist & hope you have them. This z d time.Ghani must do it to counter the growing propaganda that accuses the Afghan side of the collapse, Saleh said in a tweet.He also said in a subsequent tweet posted in Persian that Khalilzad's deceptions became apparent, after which it was decided that other face-to-face and telephone conversations related to him with other foreign delegations should be recorded in secret. "Now that salt is sprinkled on the wounds of our nation every day, it is necessary to publish these conversations."The tweets were in response to claims made by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in a recent interview that Ghani was responsible for the collapse of the previous Afghan government.“I talked with Ashraf Ghani on the telephone and he endorsed that a new government will be shaped led by the Taliban. We wanted an all-inclusive government in Afghanistan. Ashraf Ghani accepted that but the next day he fled Afghanistan,” Blinken had told CBS News.Khalilzad had also said previously that Afghanistan government collapsed since Afghan security forces did not show willingness to fight the Taliban. The insurgent group stormed to power in August following a military campaign which started just three months ago.Khalilzad resigned in October, and was replaced by Thomas West. Blinken thanked Khalilzad for his "decades of service".Khalilzad was the person who led talks with the Taliban in Qatar that resulted in the Doha agreement between the Islamic group and former US President Donald Trump to fully withdraw US troops by May 2021.But he has been criticised for not pressing the Taliban hard enough during peace talks.Afghan leaders lashed out at Khalilzad after his resignation. Rahmatullah Nabil, the former chief of Afghanistan's National Directorate of Security (NDS), called him a con-man. Rangin Dadfar Spanta, a former Afghan foreign minister, called Khalilzad out for his “destructive role in a shameful process”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amrullah-saleh-asks-ashraf-ghani-to-release-tapes-on-peace-talks-with-khalilzad-101635856127326.html

There are no plans to invite the Taliban to the meeting in line with the Indian government’s decision not to rush into recognising the current dispensation in Kabul.“I will not be going,” Yusuf told a news briefing in Islamabad after a meeting with his Uzbekistan counterpart Victor Makhmudov. He was responding to a question from a reporter on whether he would attend the meeting in India.“A spoiler cannot try to be a peacemaker,” he added, in an apparent reference to India.In response to another question, Yusuf said Pakistan has identified India as a hurdle to regional efforts to establish peace and security.“Pakistan has said repeatedly that if India is prepared to move forward, then we will also be ready. But there are some prerequisites and an enabling environment for moving forward,” he said.Among the prerequisites is addressing the Kashmir issue, he said. He added he didn’t see how the two sides could move forward in view of the Indian government’s policies and ideology.The Indian side had earlier planned to convene a similar meeting in April, with the participation of the former Ashraf Ghani government. However, this was scrapped due to the second wave of Coronavirus infections in India and the rapidly evolving situation in Afghanistan at the time.India recently participated in a meeting of the Moscow Format that was also joined by senior Taliban leaders. Indian officials also held talks with the Taliban leaders on the margins of the meeting in Moscow.Iran also convened a meeting of regional countries to discuss the situation in Afghanistan, though India was not invited to the meet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-nsa-says-won-t-attend-meet-on-afghanistan-convened-by-india-101635853487036.html

Local Chinese media reported Yahoo's move on Tuesday."In recognition of the increasingly challenging business and legal environment in China, Yahoo’s suite of services will no longer be accessible from mainland China as of November 1," a Yahoo spokesperson told Reuters in an email on Tuesday."Yahoo remains committed to the rights of our users and a free and open internet. We thank our users for their support."Yahoo's move follows that of Microsoft Corp, which pulled the plug on Linkedin in China last month, marking the retreat of the last major U.S.-owned social network in China. Linkedin cited a "more challenging operating environment and greater compliance requirements in China".Yahoo had already greatly scaled back its presence in China over the past few years. Prior to Monday, it had still operated a weather app and some pages that showed news articles in foreign languages.Yahoo entered China in 1998 and in 2012 struck a deal with Alibaba Group to sell its stake in the e-commerce giant. The deal also saw Alibaba obtain the right to operate Yahoo China under the Yahoo brand for up to four years.Yahoo China later shut its email service and web portal but the brand retained a global research and development center in Beijing until 2015, when it was shut down.Its departure comes as Beijing has imposed fresh curbs on its internet companies on areas from content to customer privacy as well as new laws. On Monday, its new Personal Information Protection law designed to protect online user data privacy came into effect.In May, Verizon Communications sold Yahoo and its other media businesses to private equity firm Apollo Global for $5 billion.The Chinese website of tech blog Engadget, which was also sold in the deal, was also unavailable on Tuesday and only displayed Yahoo's announcement on no longer providing content for mainland China users.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/yahoo-leaves-china-for-good-cites-challenging-environment-101635853411663.html
02-11-2021||World||China asks families to stock up daily necessities, triggers speculation||The Chinese government has asked families to stock up daily necessities in case of emergencies and directed authorities to maintain adequate food supplies, sparking online speculation on the possible reasons behind the directive.The unusual notice published by China’s commerce ministry comes in the backdrop of heavy rains in October that caused widespread flooding and damage to crops including in the province of Shandong, China’s biggest vegetable growing area.Adding to concerns of food supply shortages and increase in prices is the ongoing Covid-19 outbreak, which has led to some lockdowns and intra-provincial travel restrictions across 14 provinces including in the capital, Beijing.A notice posted by the commerce ministry on Monday evening urged “families to store a certain amount of daily necessities as needed to meet daily life and emergencies”.The commerce ministry directive made no mention of an ongoing food shortage or of whether the instructions were motivated by fears that anti-Covid measures could disrupt supply chains or leave locked-down citizens in need of food.Soon after the directive was issued by the ministry on Monday evening, netizens speculated on Chinese social media whether it could be linked to heightened tension with self-governing island, Taiwan, which Beijing claims as a breakaway region and has not ruled out using force to reunite it.The news was trending on China’s Twitter-like Weibo on Tuesday.One Weibo user wrote: “You didn’t tell us to stock up when the pandemic broke out in 2020. This is the first time that such a reminder has been issued. A little scared…countries don’t publish scary news like this unless they have to.”In response, the Economic Daily, a Communist Party China (CPC)-backed newspaper, told netizens not to have “too much of an overactive imagination” and that the directive’s purpose was to make sure citizens were not caught off guard if there was a lockdown in their area.“In the long run it (the notice) is also to advocate residents to improve their awareness of emergency management and increase the necessary household emergency commodities reserves as a necessary supplement to the national emergency response system,” the Economic Daily article said.The commerce ministry directed the authorities to track the supply, demand and price changes of daily necessities including vegetables and meat, and issue early warnings if necessary.The notice said local authorities should strengthen and optimise emergency distribution networks for daily necessities.It added that at places where “closed management measures” for Covid-19 prevention were implemented, the authorities should promptly announce the source and contact information of the relevant supply network.China kept infection numbers low through a Covid-zero strategy of border closures, targeted lockdowns and long quarantine periods.It is increasingly adopting tough measures even to contain a handful of cases - though infections have been detected in several provinces - like in the latest outbreak, especially ahead of the Beijing Winter Olympics beginning on February 4, 2022.Besides the pandemic disrupting the supply chain, China has been hit hard by unusually heavy rains and flooding in the last two years especially in the central and eastern provinces.China also plans to release vegetable reserves “at an appropriate time” to counter rising prices, according to a state TV report late on Monday, quoted by Reuters.It is not clear which vegetables China holds in reserves and how big those reserves are.The state planning body has called for the timely replanting of vegetables, urging local governments to support fast-growing produce, according to the report.Average wholesale prices of 28 kinds of vegetables in October were up 16% from the previous month, state media reported on Monday, citing government numbers.Currently, China has about 100 million mu (6.7 million hectares) planted with vegetables, the agriculture ministry was quoted by Reuters as saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-asks-families-to-stock-up-daily-necessities-triggers-speculation-101635850534463.html

The two satellites, both prototypes, will be launched in fourth quarter next year, the company announced.“The first two satellites for Project Kuiper will be launched next fall. This is a big step towards our mission of providing fast, affordable internet to unserved and undeserved communities across the world,” the Seattle-headquartered firm tweeted on Monday. 🆕: The first two satellites for Project Kuiper will launch next fall. This is a big step toward our mission of providing fast, affordable broadband to unserved and underserved communities around the world. https://t.co/LIo7Aj2DSw pic.twitter.com/qmRR7LFyIeIn a statement, Amazon said that the two satellites will be called ‘KuiperSat-1’ and ‘KuiperSat-2,’ adding that these will be used to test the communications and network technology that will be used in the final satellite design. Describing these as an ‘important step' in the development process, the company also said that the two will have much of the technology and sub-systems which power the production version of the satellite design.Additionally, the team will also test the prototype of the project's low-cost customer terminal; the platform has been designed to provide fast, reliable services at a cost far more affordable than that incurred due to legacy antennas.“We have filed an experimental license application with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to launch, deploy and operate the prototype satellites for Project Kuiper,” the statement noted. “These initial launches will be supported by the all-new RS1 rocket under an agreement with the ABL Space Systems, which has designed it. The launches will take place at the Florida-based Cape Canaveral Space Force Centre,” the statement mentioned further.Project Kuiper was developed under Kuiper Systems LLC, a subsidiary of Amazon which was set up in 2019. Currently, more than 750 people are working on it, and hundreds more will be added to the team in the coming years, Amazon said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amazon-to-launch-first-2-satellites-under-project-kuiper-next-year-101635844936330.html

The far-right government of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has particularly come under fire over the deforestation of the Amazon.Greenpeace criticized the Glasgow initiative for giving the green light to “another decade of deforestation.”“Indigenous peoples are calling for 80% of the Amazon to be protected by 2025, and they're right, that's what's needed,” said Greenpeace Brazil executive director Carolina Pasquali.“The climate and the natural world can't afford this deal,” she said.​​​​​​||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cop26-world-leaders-back-deal-to-end-deforestation-by-2030-101635830074477.html

Facebook would be stronger with someone who was willing to focus on safety."The social network, with nearly 3 billion users, changed its name to Meta last week, in a rebrand that focuses on building the "metaverse," a shared virtual environment that it bets will be the successor to the mobile internet.But early adopters of the virtual worlds known as the metaverse blasted Facebook's rebranding as an attempt to capitalise on growing buzz over a concept it did not create to deflect from recent negative attention.Commenting on the rebranding, Haugen said it made no sense given the security issues that have yet to be tackled."Over and over Facebook chooses expansion and new areas instead of sticking the landing on what they've already done," Haugen told an animated crowd which frequently burst into applause as she spoke.Facebook's announcement came amid strong criticism from lawmakers and regulators over the corporation's business practices - particularly its enormous market power, algorithmic decisions and the policing of abuses on its services.The social media network, which operates a dual class share structure through which Zuckerberg and a small group of investors control the company, has hit back saying the documents leaked by Haugen were being used to paint a "false picture."Haugen told British and American lawmakers last month that Facebook would fuel more violent unrest worldwide unless it curbed its algorithms which push extreme, divisive content and prey on vulnerable demographics to keep them scrolling."A key problem is that the foundation of the platform's security is based on monitoring content language by language, which does not scale to all the countries where Facebook operates," Haugen noted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/step-down-and-allow-change-facebook-whistleblower-urges-mark-zuckerberg-101635819016924.html
02-11-2021||World||One case, 33,000 tests: In China, a very Disney story||Shanghai Disneyland was closed Monday over a single Covid-19 case, as Chinese authorities pressed ahead with their zero-infection strategy before the Winter Olympics.China had reduced most domestic cases to a trickle throughout the pandemic, but a flare-up in recent weeks has tested Beijing’s determination to eliminate Covid-19 even as much of the rest of the world opens up.There were 92 new cases reported Monday -- the highest since mid-September.Shanghai Disneyland closed after a woman who visited the park on Saturday tested positive upon returning home to a neighbouring province, state media said.Disneyland said it would remain shut for at least Monday and Tuesday “to follow the requirement(s) of pandemic prevention and control”.The reopening date was yet to be confirmed, it added.The park began barring new visitors from entering on Sunday, with everyone in the park required to take a Covid-19 test before leaving.Nearly 34,000 people were tested by Monday morning, the city government said, with all tests negative.State media footage showed scores of health workers in hazmat suits inside Disneyland, as masked visitors waited underneath fireworks at the park’s landmark castle.The closure comes after Beijing’s newly opened Universal Studios said Saturday that close contacts of infected people had been found among the previous weekend’s visitors.All staff at that theme park -- which entered a “state of emergency prevention” on Friday -- have tested negative and no trace of the virus has been detected on the site, the park added.Beijing is due to host the Winter Olympics in under 100 days, and authorities have said eradicating the virus is their biggest challenge in the run-up.At a Monday press conference, deputy chief of Beijing’s disease control centre Pang Xinghuo said the current outbreak remained “severe and complex”, especially as the weather turns colder.At least three districts in the capital have closed cinemas and other entertainment venues in an effort to curb the spread of the virus.About six million people are under lockdown orders, mostly in northern parts of China.Mi Feng, spokesperson for the National Health Commission, said at a press conference Saturday that authorities would continue to “strictly prohibit people in locked-down communities from leaving their homes”.After logging two new cases Sunday, the northeastern city of Harbin, locked down two housing compounds, closed schools and kindergartens for one week and suspended inter-city bus services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/one-case-33-000-tests-in-china-a-very-disney-story-101635817268616.html

Together, the US, the European Union, Britain and Brazil - all upper-middle- or high-income countries - account for one-eighth of the world’s population but nearly half of all reported deaths.The US alone has recorded over 740,000 lives lost, more than any other nation.The death toll, as tallied by Johns Hopkins University, is about equal to the populations of Los Angeles and San Francisco combined.It rivals the number of people killed in battles among nations since 1950, according to estimates from the Peace Research Institute Oslo.Globally, Covid-19 is now the third leading cause of death, after heart disease and stroke.Russian region extends off-work orderAuthorities in Russia’s Novgorod region on Monday ordered most residents to stay off work for one more week starting November 8 as infections and deaths remained at all-time highs.The Novgorod region was the first to extend the nationwide non-working period between October 30 and November 7 that was ordered by President Vladimir Putin.Russia’s state coronavirus task force on Monday reported more than 40,000 new confirmed cases for the third straight day and more than 1,100 deaths for the seventh day in a row - the highest levels in each category since the start of the pandemic.Putin has said that governments in regions where the situation is the most dire could start the non-working days earlier and extend them if needed.Meanwhile, about 9,000 municipal workers were put on unpaid leave for refusing to comply with a vaccine mandate that took effect on Monday, New York City mayor Bill de Blasio said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-covid-19-deaths-top-5-million-101635816545340.html
02-11-2021||World||BASIC nations underline climate finance goal||Brazil, South Africa, India, and China -- nations that form the ‘Basic’ grouping -- are seeking a fresh long-term climate finance goal at the COP26 summit in Glasgow, according to a statement presented by India’s environment minister, Bhupender Yadav, on behalf of the bloc.Yadav said during the opening of COP26 that the grouping endorsed for the delivery of the promised $100 billion climate finance support for developing countries, and a carbon market mechanism that facilitates private sector engagement in the fight against climate change.The Basic grouping added that its views were aligned with the position taken by the Western African country of Guinea on behalf of the G77 group of developing nations and China.“Delivered the Basic statement at the opening plenary of #COP26, underlining that developed nations have not only failed to meet the $100 billion goal per year of support to developing nations since 2009, but also continue to present it as a ceiling of their ambition all the way to 2025,” Bhupender Yadav tweeted on Monday.At the COP15 meeting in Copenhagen in 2009, developed countries committed to mobilising $100 billion a year by 2020 to support developing countries in climate change mitigation efforts. These funds were meant to come from a wide variety of sources, public and private, bilateral, and multilateral, and including alternative sources of finance.“On the long-term temperature goal, the latest available science makes it clear that all parties need to immediately contribute their fair share,” the Basic statement said. “Achieving it will require developed countries to rapidly reduce their emissions and dramatically scale up their financial support to developing countries. Unfortunately, we have not made much progress on these issues. It is particularly disturbing.”The Basic nations said they were expecting a clear road map from developed countries on their existing obligations to mobilise $100 billion per year from 2021 to 2025… and the willingness to urgently initiate the process within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) of setting a new collective quantified goal on finance.The bloc also said it was expecting a market mechanism that facilitates private sector engagement in carbon markets in the larger fight against the climate crisis.“Decisions particularly on climate finance and Article 6 (which pertains to cutting emissions) can significantly help enhance climate ambition,” the Basic statement said.A finance delivery plan jointly led by Canada and Germany said last month that developed countries will likely be able to mobilise $100 billion funding only in 2023 - with a delay of three years.Such a delay not only risks delaying how countries roll-out climate crisis mitigation measures -- such as switching to clean energy -- but also threatens to open the rift between the developed and developing nations on the crisis. Developing countries like India have pointed to what they say is lack of equity in responsibility and climate justice since developed countries have typically enjoyed decades of unbridled climate restrictions when they grew.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/basic-nations-underline-climate-finance-goal-101635810542215.html
02-11-2021||World||Queen Elizabeth calls for joint action on climate crisis||Queen Elizabeth II on Monday appealed to world leaders to work together in "common cause" against climate change to "solve the most insurmountable problems".The statement, delivered in a video message to the COP-26 conference in Glasgow came after a day of speeches from world leaders warning of the urgency of the crisis."If the world pollution situation is not critical at the moment, it is as certain as anything can be, that the situation will become increasingly intolerable within a very short time...," said the Queen."If we fail to cope with this challenge, all the other problems will pale into insignificance."She added: "None of us underestimates the challenges ahead: but history has shown that when nations come together in common cause, there is always room for hope."Earlier, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres had issued a similarly stark warning."We are digging our own graves," he said, referring to the current exploitation of the planet's resources.But some observers have already denounced what they see as a lack of action to back up the statements from world leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/queen-elizabeth-calls-for-joint-action-on-climate-crisis-101635797770899.html

In an order, the administration said the employees were found to be inefficient and “acting against public interest”.The Union territory (UT) has lately been plagued with terrorist attacks, especially against migrants living in the region. As many as 11 civilians were killed last month. Several of these victims were migrants from Bihar. So far, this year, 32 civilians have been shot dead in Kashmir by terrorists.Also Read | Security tightened, searches intensified after J&K civilian killingsThe probe into six civilian killings has been handed over to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) with The Resistance Front (TRF) – an arm of the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), coming out as the perpetrators of most of the attacks, Hindustan Times had earlier reported.In counter-attacks carried out in the restive terrain, at least 13 terrorists, including a top LeT commander, have been shot dead by security forces. Last Thursday, the Jammu and Kashmir Police a terrorist, who was allegedly involved in the killing of two migrant labourers in the Valley, was gunned down.In a series of tweets, the J&K Police said the terrorist, Javid Ahmad Wani, was killed before he could target a shopkeeper in Baramulla region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/school-principal-top-prisons-dept-officer-fired-in-j-k-over-terror-links-101635876333330.html

Former legislators will be entitled to benefits and allowances only if they have completed a five-year term, the state government announced after a cabinet meeting.The decision reverses a 2019 amendment to the rules that ended the requirement for ex-legislators to serve as a lawmaker for at least four years to entitle them to a monthly pension - the amendment also hiked it from ₹17,250 to ₹34,500 - besides medical cover for their families. After the 2019 amendment came into force, ex-legislators were entitled to the pension and medical cover if they served as MLA for just a day.Tuesday’s decision requiring MLAs to serve a full term means first-time legislators who quit their seats to cross sides, or are disqualified, will not get the pensionary benefit.“This is a positive move of the state government taken during the cabinet meeting today. We believe that the accountability and integrity towards the government among the legislators will improve with the decision,” cabinet spokesperson and information and cultural affairs minister Sushanta Chowdhury told the reporters at the civil secretariat on Tuesday evening.Chowdhury added that it would be applicable to all those who became legislators in 2018.The decision comes days after Ashish Das, who was elected on a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ticket from Surma constituency in Dhalai district in the 2018 state elections, crossed over to Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress. Das formally made the switch at a public meeting addressed by TMC general secretary Abhijit Banerjee on October 31. But he had made his intention clear during his visit to Kolkata last month when he tonsured his head, took a dip in the Ganga and called it “an act of penance” before joining West Bengal’s ruling party.Just a few hours before the cabinet signed off on the change in the rules, assembly speaker Ratan Chakraborty sent out a notice to Ashish Das under the anti-defection law.Chowdhury did not give a direct response when asked if Ashish Das’s exit was the provocation for the change in rules. He reiterated that it will be applicable for current members too.Chowdhury also linked TMC’s Abhishek Banerjee’s public meeting in the West district on October 31 to an increase in the Covid-19 positivity rate in Tripura’s West and North district, saying many people from different states including neighbouring Assam entered the state through Churaibari in North district.Over the past three days, he said, the positivity rate in the West district has risen from 0.40% to 0.72%, and from 0.21% to 1.04% in the North district.“The state has controlled Covid-19 graph through vaccines and also mandated RT-PCR tests at all the entry points for the outsiders. But the political party concerned tried to malign the government by politicising our implementation of the Covid-19 guidelines. We condemn this,” Chowdhury said.Only 500 people were allowed to attend Banerjee’s first public rally on Sunday as per Tripura high court order following a TMC petition after state police told the party to shift their venue to Swami Vivekananda Maidan. The state also mandated all the passengers coming from states with 5% or above positivity rate to produce negative RT-PCR reports irrespective of their Covid-19 vaccination status.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tripura-changes-rule-on-allowances-for-ex-mlas-after-bjp-lawmaker-joins-tmc-101635876647770.html
02-11-2021||India||Delhi's AQI may enter 'severe' zone due to crackers, farm fires on Diwali: SAFAR||Delhi's air quality is likely to enter the 'severe' zone on Diwali night and the share of stubble burning in its PM2.5 pollution may go up to 40 per cent the day after, according to the Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality forecast agency SAFAR.Under the zero firecracker emission scenario, Delhi's PM2.5 concentration is predicted to be in the upper end of the 'very poor' category from November 4 to November 6."However, even if we consider 50 per cent of firecracker-related emissions of 2019, the AQI is predicted to degrade to the 'severe' category from November 4 night and will remain so till November 5," SAFAR said.The PM2.5 concentration in the national capital can surpass 300 micrograms per cubic metre on November 5. The safe limit is 60 micrograms per cubic metre.The contribution of farm fires in Delhi's air pollution has remained low this season so far due to the record-breaking rainfall in October and "unfavourable" wind direction.However, it is likely to go up to 40 per cent by November 5 as the wind direction is expected to change northwesterly after Diwali, said Gufran Beig, the founder project director of SAFAR.Northwesterly winds carry smoke from farm fires in Punjab and Haryana towards the national capital.Farm fires accounted for six per cent of the PM2.5 pollution in the national capital on Tuesday. The contribution will remain marginal (less than 10 per cent) until November 3 despite a higher fire count due to unfavourable wind direction, SAFAR said."Stubble fire share in Delhi's PM2.5 is predicted to be 20 per cent to 40 per cent during November 4-6," SAFAR said adding the peak could be recorded on November 5 if the fire counts are assumed to be 4,000 as expected.Last year, the share of stubble burning in Delhi's pollution had peaked at 42 per cent on November 5. In 2019, crop residue burning accounted for 44 per cent of Delhi's PM2.5 pollution on November 1.The air quality in the national capital entered the very 'poor' category for the first time this season on Tuesday owing to unfavourable conditions for dispersion of pollutants, authorities said.Stubble burning accounted for six per cent of the PM2.5 pollution in Delhi on Tuesday. The rest of the pollution is due to local sources, Beig said.According to the Central Pollution Control Board, the capital recorded a 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) of 303. It was 281 on Monday, 289 on Sunday and 268 on Saturday.The neighbouring cities of Faridabad (306), Ghaziabad (334) and Noida (303) also recorded very poor air quality.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate', 201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhis-aqi-may-enter-severe-zone-due-to-crackers-farm-fires-on-diwali-safar-101635871122004.html

Party chief Ravinder Raina said the former member of the legislative council’s remarks were against the basic principles of the party, which believes in respecting all faiths.A disciplinary committee headed by Sunil Sethi has given an interim report to the party on Randhawa’s speech.The report has been examined by J&K BJP president Ravinder Raina and it has been decided to agree with interim recommendations made by the disciplinary committee.Raina also strongly felt that disparaging remarks have been made against women as well as a particular community and have hurt the “religious sentiments of our brothers and sisters”, his party said, adding that the state unit found it “unacceptable” that a person occupying a senior position in the party makes a statement which hurts religious sentiments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jammu-and-kashmir-bjp-sacks-party-secretary-vikram-randhawa-over-provocative-remarks-101635873829909.html

Rajender tendered his resignation earlier in June after he was sacked from the state council of ministers over allegations of land encroachment.“Despite the fact that the ruling TRS spent hundreds of crores of rupees in this election, people of Huzurabad voted for BJP candidate Etela Rajender. I thank the people of Huzurabad for rejecting money power and voting for BJP,” Union minister G Kishen Reddy was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.“People of Telangana are confident about the BJP and they believe this is the only effective and dynamic party that can counter the misrule of the TRS government,” Ponguleti Sudhakar Reddy, BJP's national co-incharge for Tamil Nadu, was quoted as saying by PTI. Reddy said the BJP was exposing the TRS-led government for a long time.Meanwhile, in Andhra, the Jagan Mohan Reddy-led YSRC retained the Badvel seat, which is reserved for Scheduled Caste candidates. YSRC's Dasari Sudha polled 1,12,211 votes, while Suresh secured only 21,678 votes. In 2019, Venkata Subbiah, Sudha’s husband, had won the seat by 44,734 votes from the Badvel seat.In a tweet, Reddy thanked the voters of Badvel constituency and complimented Sudha and party workers for the victory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-andhra-bypolls-rajender-wins-in-huzurabad-ysrc-retains-badvel-101635872370760.html
02-11-2021||India||New impetus for setting up theatre commands, key deadline advanced||The department of military affairs (DMA), headed by chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat, has asked the three services to expedite their ongoing studies on the creation of threatre commands, and submit comprehensive reports within six months, officials familiar with the developments said on Tuesday on the condition of anonymity.The deadline for submitting reports focusing on finalising the joint structures has been advanced from September 2022 to April 2022, one of the officials said.On Monday, Rawat held a meeting with the three service chiefs and top three-star officers, who are conducting the studies, to chart out a road map to accelerate the theaterisation plan, said a second official.The current theaterisation model seeks to set up four new integrated commands -- two land-centric theatres, an air defence command, and a maritime theatre command -- to best utilise the military’s resources for future wars and operations. The creation of theatre commands could take up to two years, a second official said.Theaterisation refers to placing specific units of the army, the navy and the air force under a theatre commander. Such commands are to be led by an officer from any of the three services, depending on the roles assigned to them.The earlier India sets up theatre commands, the better, said Lieutenant General Vinod Bhatia (retd), former director, Centre for Joint Warfare Studies (CENJOWS). “Setting a deadline for theaterisation is critical as delay will only cause disruption. We need to optimise our combat effectiveness in view of the emerging geostrategic equations,” Bhatia added.In June 2021, the government formed an eight-member panel under CDS to fine-tune the theaterisation plans and bring all stakeholders on board, especially IAF, for speedy roll-out of the new joint structures.IAF’s earlier reservations to the move revolved around asset split, leadership and dilution of the powers of the service chiefs. However, on October 5, IAF chief Air Chief Marshal Vivek Ram Chaudhari said that the air force was fully committed to tri-service integration and its concerns about the theaterisation model had been factored into the planning process. He hoped that the new structures would cater for joint planning of operations at all levels.The armed forces currently have 17 single-service commands spread across the country, apart from the tri-service Andaman and Nicobar Command and the Strategic Forces Command. The army and IAF have seven commands each, while the navy has three. Creating theatres would involve merging the existing commands (except the Northern Command).The army’s Udhampur-based Northern Command is the only single-service command that will stay outside the scope of the military’s theaterisation drive due to its unique role. It is responsible for guarding the country’s borders with Pakistan and China in the north, and is also the nerve centre of counterterrorism operations in Jammu and Kashmir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-impetus-for-setting-up-theatre-commands-key-deadline-advanced-101635872449327.html

The statue was handed over by the vice-chancellor of the university to India’s high commissioner to Ottawa, Ajay Bisaria, during a virtual event last year.The Archeological Survey of India (ASI) received the idol on October 15 and will be placed at the Kashi Vishwanath Temple.Also Read | Canada to return 18th century Annapurna statue to IndiaThe Union minister for culture and tourism G.

Ellenabad, a traditional stronghold for the Chautala family, voted for the INLD leader, marking his fourth win from here and fifth electoral win in an assembly poll.Chautala had earlier resigned from the state legislative assembly over the three farm laws. After his victory, Chautala said the win belonged to the farmers. “This is not my victory. It is a win of the farmers and people of Ellenabad,” he was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Chautala said the BJP and Congress had colluded to defeat him. “My margin was going to be very big. I would have won by over 50,000 votes had the BJP-JJP not indulged in horse-trading and had the Congress not colluded with them. Money power was used to lure voters, the official machinery was misused. We made 15 complaints to the Election Commission, but we did not get any response,” Chautala said.Haryana minister Anil Vij said Chautala’s win was not a reflection of people’s rejection of the central farm laws. “The issue on which he resigned from the Assembly has been completely negated by the people of Ellenabad. If that issue was so strong, then his victory margin would have increased. The fact that his margin this time has reduced only proves that people have rejected the issue for which he resigned,” Vij said.Chautala polled a total of 65,992 votes, BJP’s Kanda who came in second secured 59,253 votes, while Congress’ Beniwal got 20,904 votes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/haryana-bypolls-inld-s-abhay-chautala-calls-win-farmers-victory-101635869189873.html

02-11-2021||India||NOTA finishes third in tribal-dominated seat in Madhya Pradesh||About 3.89% of voters rejected all the candidates and opted for ‘none of the above (NOTA)’ in a scheduled tribal reserved seat in Jobat, Madhya Pradesh. BJP candidate Sulochana Rawat won from the seat with a margin of 6104 votes against Mahesh Patel of Congress. NOTA finished third with 5611 votes. While in the other two assembly seats- Raigaon and Prithvipur - only 1% of people opted for NOTA, officials said. In the last election, an independent candidate, Vishal Rawat, son of Sulochana Rawat, finished third with more than 22,000 votes. A Gujarat based Bhartiya Tribal Party also tried luck in this election from Jobat. The candidate Sardar Parmar of the party received 3056 votes only. Experts said tribals are getting aware of their rights and know how to exercise their voting power. “Tribals have started discussing the capability of candidates. Now, educated members of the tribal community want to talk about their rights. But candidates of political parties’ are still busy taking the agenda of their party ahead. They failed to impress voters which resulted in people opting for NOTA,” said Vikram Achaliya, a tribal expert. Jai Adiwasi Yuva Sangathan’s Anand Rai said, “Now, tribals want a party which focuses on the core issues of the tribals because they realize that Congress and BJP are not concerned about their issues. Even, these parties want to finish their identity so some people exercised their vote in favour of NOTA.” However, Congress leaders said the administration played a game and diverted the votes of Congress to NOTA. Congress spokesperson JP Dhanopia said, “On the machine, the first button belongs to Congress candidate Mahesh Patel and last button to NOTA. When a layman asks for assistance to vote for Congress, the official would ask them to press the first button without mentioning whether from the top or bottom. People pressed NOTA and that’s why it finished third.” Similarly, BJP feels that people pressed NOTA because they were unhappy with Congress. “The voters are unhappy with fake promises of Congress and that’s why they opted for it to ensure the defeat but the trend will change as after the BJP candidate wins the election, these people will realize that BJP is a fair option for the development of the belt,” said Ashish Agrawal, spokesperson BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nota-finishes-third-in-tribal-dominated-seat-in-madhya-pradesh-101635861587722.html

One of the petitions at the high court hearing had claimed that the blanket ban within West Bengal was “patently erroneous” when the Supreme Court has allowed the use of green firecrackers in permissible limits across the country.The Supreme Court order was welcomed with a cheer by fireworks traders in West Bengal who make nearly 75-80 per cent of their annual sale, estimated to be around ₹5000 crore, during this festive season.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/firecrackers-ban-calcutta-hc-to-hear-plea-seeking-implementation-of-sc-order-101635857931687.html

The senior BJP leader, however, added that his party was declared winner in the same seats where it had lost previous by-elections.“BJP candidates never get cars, mics, or accommodation during the by-elections here. Police get the voting done, which is one-sided and not neutral. Earlier, too, we lost the by-elections but won the general elections at the same place,” Ghosh was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.The Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress romped home a 4-0 clean sweep in the by-elections having wrested the Dinhata and Santipur seats in Coochbehar and Nadia districts respectively, from the BJP, and retaining Khardah and Gosaba by huge margins. The ruling camp’s tally was now raised to 215 in the 294-member West Bengal assembly, while the BJP saw its tally come down to 75 from an earlier 77.The Trinamool Congress, in total, bagged 75.02 per cent of the votes cast, whereas the BJP got some 14.48 per cent votes, in the four assembly segments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-bypolls-bjp-s-dilip-ghosh-says-cops-get-voting-done-here-101635859519058.html

In his seven-page resignation letter sent to party chief Sonia Gandhi on Tuesday, Singh called the cricketer-turned-politician "an acolyte of the Pakistani deep state" and "a person of unstable mind"."Despite my profound reservations and over the unanimous advice of almost all the MPs from Punjab, you chose to appoint an acolyte of the Pakistani deep state Navjot Sidhu who had publicly hugged the Pakistan Army Chief Gen Bajwa and Prime Minister Imran Khan, as the President of the Punjab Congress Committee. Khan and Bajwa are the people responsible for sending terrorists across the border to kill Indians," Singh said in his resignation letter.Singh posted a copy of the letter on his Twitter handle.I have today sent my resignation to @INCIndia President Ms Sonia Gandhi ji, listing my reasons for the resignation.‘Punjab Lok Congress’ is the name of the new party. The registration is pending approval with the @ECISVEEP. The party symbol will be approved later. pic.twitter.com/Ha7f5HKouq"Sidhu's only claim to fame was that he would abuse me and my government on a regular basis. I am old enough to be his father but that did not stop him from using the filthiest and most vile language against me both publicly and privately," he further said.The former chief minister also took on Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi. "Unfortunately rather than being reined in, he was patronised by Rahul and Priyanka, while you chose to turn a blind eye to the shenanigans of this gentleman," said Singh in the letter.He then talked about the most “egregious” act - calling a Congress Legislature Party (CLP) meeting over his head at the dead of the night and that too through Twitter. Terming it a "midnight conspiracy", Singh told Sonia Gandhi it was "carried out against me at your and your children's behest".Singh resigned as the Punjab chief minister on September 18 after a bitter tussle with Sidhu amid infighting in the state Congress. The party later picked Charanjit Singh Channi as the next chief minister of the state.Sidhu too was elevated to the position of Punjab Congress president. After resigning hours before the CLP meeting, Singh had said he felt "humiliated".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/acolyte-of-pak-deep-state-amarinder-singh-targets-sidhu-in-resignation-letter-101635859194378.html
02-11-2021||India||India, Russia likely to hold 2+2 dialogue this month; defence, trade pacts on cards||India and Russia are expected to hold their first 2+2 dialogue of defence and foreign ministers in Moscow by mid-November, and this could be followed by the annual summit in December.A number of agreements in the defence, economic, trade, and science and technology spheres are expected to be signed during the summit, India’s outgoing ambassador to Russia, BV Varma, said. The two sides are also set to announce the joint commission on technology and science and extend their military-technical cooperation for the period 2021-2031, Varma said in an interview with TASS news agency.Defence minister Rajnath Singh and external affairs minister S Jaishankar are expected to travel to Moscow for the first 2+2 dialogue with Russia. India has similar dialogues only with the US, Japan and Australia.Varma said both sides are working to take forward cooperation in diverse areas during the bilateral summit. “Both sides are actively working on it. There is a high possibility that the summit is taking place in December,” he said.Referring to the 2+2 dialogue, Varma said it was “important for friends like India and Russia to have an additional level of consultations”.“For example, India and Russia can have more focused cooperation in Central Asia, in the Indian Ocean region. A number of developments, including those relating to Afghanistan, have created new challenges. And I think the 2+2 dialogue will be a very important addition to the architecture of dialogue that you have rightly pointed out already exists,” he said.Varma said there has been a diversification of India-Russia relations in recent years, and the Indian side is considering major projects in the energy sector and long-term arrangements for coking coal and fertilisers. In the defence field, the value of contracts had gone up from about $2-3 billion dollars a year in 2018 to about $9-10 billion dollars, he said.“We have major defence contracts already under implementation. The S-400 is one of them. We also have a contract relating to the manufacture and production of 1135.6 frigates...,” Varma said.The production of more than 700,000 AK-203 rifles will be done in India, and New Delhi is going to buy additional Su-30-MKI and MiG-29 jets and 400 more T-90 tanks, the envoy said. “Russia has moved back again as the top defence partner of India,” he added.Asked about a meeting between Indian officials and Taliban leaders on the margins of the Moscow Format meet last month, Varma said, “There was a meeting with the Taliban. We put forward our points of view, the Taliban put forward their points of view. This is the dialogue that we continue. “No decisions were taken either way on both sides. But I think India will engage in the humanitarian situation because the humanitarian situation is quite serious and India’s always placed the well-being of the Afghan people as the topmost priority.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-russia-likely-to-hold-2-2-dialogue-this-month-defence-trade-pacts-on-cards-101635859307551.html
02-11-2021||India||Himachal Pradesh bypolls: Congress sweeps Mandi Lok Sabha, all 3 assembly seats||Ahead of the Himachal Pradesh assembly elections next year, the Congress on Tuesday secured major victories in the bypolls which were held on October 30. It not only wrested the Mandi Lok Sabha seat from ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), but also won all three assembly seats - Fatehpur, Arki and Jubbal-Kotkhai.Congress candidate Pratibha Singh won by 7,490 votes from Mandi, defeating Khushal Thakur of the BJP. Singh, wife of former Himachal Pradesh chief minister Virbhadra Singh defeated Kargil war veteran Brigadier Khushal Thakur. In the 2019 parliamentary polls, BJP's Ram Swaroop Sharma had emerged victorious by a whopping 4,05,000 votes. In Jubbal-Kotkhai, Congress' Rohit Thakur emerged as the victor by 6,293 votes.Congress also retained Fatehpur and Arki legislative assembly constituencies where its candidates Bhawani Singh and Sanjay Awasthi emerged victorious respectively. While Singh defeated his BJP rival Baldev Thakur by 5,789 votes in Fatehpur, Awasthi defeated the saffron party's Rattan Pal by 3, 219 votes.Congress, invigorated with these wins, demanded the resignation of Himachal Pradesh chief minister Jai Ram Thakur on moral grounds. “Thakur even failed to retain the BJP's seat in his home district Mandi,” Himachal Pradesh Congress chief Kuldeep Singh Rathore said.“This is a vote for change, against the anti-people policies of the BJP's Union and Himachal Pradesh governments. It is a mandate expressing people's solidarity with the pro-people stance of our leaders Soniaji and Rahul Gandhi ji,” Congress Himachal Pradesh in-charge Sanjay Dutt.Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur, meanwhile, accepted the people’s mandate but pledged to take action against cadres of the BJP who may have worked against the party. “The BJP will introspect the causes which led to its defeat, will formulate a strategy to overcome its shortcomings and do everything possible to ensure victory in the 2022 assembly elections,” Thakur was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.

02-11-2021||India||Swapna Suresh gets bail in UAPA case, to walk out after 15 months in jail||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Swapna Suresh, the former secretary at UAE’s consulate general’s Thiruvananthapuram office arrested in July 2020 on charges of running a gold smuggling racket, was granted bail along with seven others by the Kerala high court on Tuesday in a case investigated by the National Investigation Agency under the anti-terror law Unlawful Activities Prevention Act.Tuesday’s ruling by the bench of justices Vinod Chandran and C Jayachandran will enable Swapna Suresh to walk out of prison after 15 months. She was earlier granted bail in related cases registered by the Enforcement Directorate and Customs department. Last month, a different bench of the high court also set aside the detention order issued under Cofeposa (Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act).“I feel she is innocent and made a pawn by others,” said Swapna Suresh’s mother Kumari Prabha after Tuesday’s bail order.The other seven also granted bail are PS Sarith, Rabins Hameed, KT Ramees, KT Sharfuddin, Mohammad Ali, Rabins Hameed and AM Jalal. At one point, NIA officials alleged that KT Ramees and M Sharafuddin visited Tanzania on several occasions and met Dawood Ibrahim’s contact Feroze ‘Oasis’ to discuss ways to smuggle firearms into the country.Additional solicitor general SV Raju, who appeared for NIA, opposed the bail plea by the eight suspects, saying they were kingpins behind a thriving smuggling racket and charges against them were grave. NIA said Swapna Suresh and others committed a terrorist act by smuggling 167 kg of gold into India from UAE between November 2019 to June 2020 as they knew that doing so would threaten the security and economic stability of the country.But the suspects countered the NIA accusation, underscoring that the charge sheet filed against 20 people by the federal agency did not mention terror funding or involvement of transnational forces.The high court relied on observation of another bench in February that a mere act of gold smuggling, covered under the Customs Act, will not amount to a terrorist act under the provisions of the UAPA. The court observed that smuggling was done for mere profit motive and that will not come under the ambit of the UAPA. Besides, the trial in the case is not likely to begin in near future and they can’t remain in jail till then, the court said in February.The gold smuggling case surfaced in July 2020 after the seizure of 30 kg gold hidden in bathroom fittings in one of the consignments camouflaged as diplomatic baggage in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) consulate in the state capital. The case was later handed over to the National Investigation Agency and it arrested Swapna Suresh and her accomplice Sandeep Nair from Bengaluru. Five central agencies are probing the case; NIA, ED, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, Customs and Income Tax.The case invited much embarrassment to the left front government after the CM’s principal secretary M Sivasankar, a senior IAS officer, was arrested by the ED after his alleged liaison with Suresh surfaced. Later he secured bail from the high court.The union and state governments locked horns several times over the case and the latter even constituted a judicial commission against the ED, a first of its sort, alleging a bid to implicate many senior leaders including CM Pinarayi Vijayan in the case. But later the HC had quashed the judicial commission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/swapna-suresh-gets-bail-in-uapa-case-to-walk-out-after-15-months-in-jail-101635856965653.html

02-11-2021||India||YSR Congress wins Badvel seat in Andhra; BJP, Cong lose deposits||The ruling YSR Congress party in Andhra Pradesh has retained the Badvel assembly seat in Kadapa district in the by-elections with a record majority of more than 90,000 votes over its near rival Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).The polling for the by-elections was held on October 30 and the counting of votes took place on Tuesday.YSRCP candidate Dr Dasari Sudha, a practising doctor, was declared elected with a huge margin of 90,411 votes over Panathala Suresh of the Bharatiya Janata Party. While Sudha secured 1,12,072 votes, the BJP candidate polled only 21,661 votes. Congress candidate, former MLA P M Kamalamma, finished third with 6,217 votes. Both the BJP and the Congress lost their deposits.The by-election was necessitated with the death of Sudha’s husband and sitting MLA Dr Gunthoti Venkata Subbaiah due to illness in March this year.“I am overwhelmed by the affection shown by the people of Badvel who blessed me with double the majority my husband got in the 2019 assembly elections. It reflects the people’s endorsement to the governance of our chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy,” Sudha told reporters after being declared elected by the returning officer.In the 2019 assembly elections, Sudha’s husband Venkata Subbaiah secured a majority of around 45,000 votes over then Telugu Desam Party candidate Obulapuram Rajasekhar.However, the victory of YSRCP in the Badvel by-election was a foregone conclusion as the party had been representing the constituency for the last two terms. Secondly, Kadapa district had been the bastion of Jagan’s family since the days of his father late Dr YS Rajasekhar Reddy, former Congress chief minister.When YSR was alive, Kadapa was dominated by the Congress and after the bifurcation of combined Andhra Pradesh, the Congress lost its hold as all the party cadre shifted loyalties to the YSRCP. In the last general elections, the YSRCP won all the 10 assembly seats and two Lok Sabha seats in Kadapa.This time, the TDP opted out of the contest on the grounds of upholding the tradition of not fielding a candidate against the spouse of the deceased MLA in any by-election. So did Jana Sena Party led by popular Tollywood actor Pawan Kalyan.However, the BJP and the Congress contested the Badvel by-elections, despite the fact that they lacked enough strength to take on the YSRCP.The BJP, however, campaigned extensively in the by-election only to test its strength. Several BJP leaders including state party president Somu Veerraju, BJP national general secretary Daggubati Purandeshwari, BJP national in-charge of AP Sunil Deodhar, MPs C M Ramesh and GVL Narasimha Rao and BJP state secretary Satya Kumar campaigned for the BJP candidate.Congress candidate Kamalamma said the polling in Badvel did not take place in a free and fair manner. “The YSRC leaders intimidated the rivals, rigged the elections by bringing voters from neighbouring areas and influenced voters with its money and muscle power,” she alleged.The BJP leaders could not be reached for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ysr-congress-wins-badvel-seat-in-andhra-bjp-cong-lose-deposits-101635852576410.html
02-11-2021||India||‘I am the biggest environmentalist, but…’: Gadkari defends Goa infra projects||PANAJI: Union minister for road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari on Tuesday said that opposition to infrastructure projects in Goa was coming in the way of economic development that could help people get jobs and come out of poverty. “I am the biggest environmentalist. I do not write books. I have an NGO which works in water conservation. It has also won an award. Ecology and the environment have to be protected. I brought alternative fuel to India. Ethanol, methanol, biodiesel, bio CNG, electric and now green hydrogen. We all should do better to obtain international benchmarks, but the economy is also important so that people can get jobs and poverty is alleviated. There has to be a balance between both, hand in hand,” Gadkari told reporters at a Press conference.Gadkari pointed to his green initiatives including introducing ethanol-blended motor spirit, and promoting CNG and electric buses, to indicate that the environment and economy need to go hand in hand. Union minister Nitin Gadkari’s remarks were a reference to opposition to infrastructure projects in Goa including the railway line double-tracking, widening the Goa-Hubli (Karnataka) highway to four lanes and a new power line. The three are proposed to pass through the Western Ghats.Goa has seen massive protests against the projects, particularly the railway project fearing that with a double line, more coal and coal dust will be moved across the railway spewing dust in the port town as well as in the villages that lie along the route.The railway line, by far the biggest of the three, will also lead to the diversion of 114 hectares of Western Ghat forest land from the protected area and the felling of 18,541 trees.The second is the plan to upgrade a two-lane highway constructed by the Portuguese colonial government between Panaji in Goa and Belgavi in Karnataka. According to the government’s plan, since there are long stretches where it would not be possible to widen the existing road due to the difficult terrain, it is proposed to build new roads on viaduct structures parallel to the existing highway in such places,This highway expansion project is projected to cost the tiny coastal state 31.015 ha of forest land and 12,097 trees.Thirdly, a 400KV power line, 3.5 km of which passes through the protected forest, to augment power supply between Goa and Karnataka to provide additional feed to Goa is also proposed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-am-the-biggest-environmentalist-but-nitin-gadkari-defends-goa-infra-projects-101635851854510.html
02-11-2021||India||UP polls: Adityanath among ‘panna pramukhs’ for micro-level voter contact||Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, his Cabinet colleagues and top ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) functionaries are among five million “panna pramukhs” nominated for micro-level contact with voters listed on each page of the electoral list for the state elections, people aware of the matter said. The polls in the country’s most populous state that sends the biggest contingent of lawmakers - 80 - to the Parliament are due early next year and are seen as crucial for the BJP’s prospects in the 2024 national polls. Union home minister Amit Shah is seen as the originator of the micro-level poll management that has been credited as one of the reasons for the BJP’s electoral successes. Also Read: Ahead of UP polls, SP chief Akhilesh’s Jinnah remark triggers political rowHe introduced the “panna pramukh” concept in 2007 in Gujarat. It was first implemented nationally in the 2014 national polls and also in the 2017 Uttar Pradesh elections, which Shah was in charge of. The BJP, which managed to win just 47 seats in the 2012 poll, swept to power in the state with 325 seats in the 403-member House in 2017. The party won 71 out of 80 Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh in 2014. It swept the national polls again in 2019 in the state by winning 64 seats despite a formidable alliance between the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP).BJP functionaries said a “panna pramukh” is expected to reach out to between 27 to 60 voters and galvanise them in the BJP’s favour through personal visits. The concept has been scaled up with the inclusion of top leaders for the first time in Uttar Pradesh. Adityanath has accordingly been named as the “panna pramukh” of booth No. 246 of the Gorakhpur (urban) assembly seat, while his deputy, Keshav Prasad Maurya, that of booth No. 254 in Prayagraj. Other prominent “panna pramukhs” include deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma, state BJP chief Swatantra Dev, Union ministers Mahendra Singh and Sanjeev Balyan.“All the 60 ministers including the chief minister are panna pramukhs of their respective polling booths. So are nearly all the party functionaries,” said BJP leader Chandramohan, who is also among the “panna pramukhs”.A second BJP leader said that “panna pramukhs” would reach out to the voters listed on each page of the voter list and tell them about the BJP’s ideology, stance and commitment to various issues. “[They will] also clear misconceptions, and any doubts that the voter may have and to encourage two-way interaction.” The second leader said there would also be a “panna” panel for better voter outreach.The BJP has also launched “main bhi panna pramukh (I too am a panna pramukh)” campaign on Facebook to mobilise its cadres.Defence minister Rajnath Singh, in an address to the BJP’s state executive committee in March in his Lucknow Lok Sabha constituency, said the position of a “panna pramukh” is as important as that of the party chief.BJP leaders said the party is also appointing heads at the level of all 16,30,00 polling booths as it is up against spirited opposition.The party faces a major challenge in western Uttar Pradesh, which has emerged among the strongholds of the agitation against the three farm laws enacted last year. Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has been at the forefront of efforts to revive her party in the state, where it has been out of power for over three decades. She has over the last few weeks met the families of the protesting farmers, who were run over by a car in Lakhimpur Kheri, as well as the kin of a sanitary worker allegedly killed in police custody in Agra and farmers, who died in Bundelkhand, amid alleged fertiliser shortage.The BSP has been wooing the Brahmins, who are counted among the BJP’s core supporters, to replicate its success in the 2007 assembly elections.A third BJP leader referred to Shah’s visit to Lucknow last week and said he asked the cadres to ensure they visit each household to convey the party’s message. “It is part of a well-thought plan by the party leadership... they would have mapped each locality. The data the party has about voters in each area is being verified through such physical visits which would also help provide feedback to the party for the manifesto for 2022 polls.”The BJP strategists are hoping that such contacts involving top leaders will raise the voter turnout in the party’s favour. “The idea is to have several ground-level cadres at the booth level of varying backgrounds to maximise the outreach,” a fourth party leader said, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-polls-adityanath-among-panna-pramukhs-for-micro-level-contact-with-voters-101635851614791.html
02-11-2021||India||When will India peak before reaching net zero emissions? Top experts weigh in||India’s announcement at the COP26 summit on climate change in Glasgow on transitioning to net zero emissions by 2070 has generated a lot of excitement among economists, environmentalists and energy researchers, particularly because as an emerging economy with extremely low per capita emissions, India has declared a move towards gradual decarbonisation.But this comes with anxiety over disruption in the energy sector and debates over when India should “peak”, the time till when a country’s emissions rise before gradually falling and achieving net zero emissions. The timing of when individual countries’ emissions peak and then decline - especially those of major emitters such as the US and China - is critically important in determining whether the most dangerous climate impacts can be avoided, according to the World Resources Institute.Also Read: Small island nations at biggest threat from climate change: PM ModiChina, in its nationally determined contributions (NDCs), for example, has said it will peak before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. It plans to lower its carbon intensity by over 65% from the 2005 level by 2030. China seeks to bring installed capacity of solar and wind to over 1,200GW by 2030, and increase the share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption to 25%, among other plans.“India’s pledge is very significant. Realistically speaking India should peak by 2040-2045. It takes a pretty long time to change our energy systems. I think 30 years is a reasonable time. So, there will be a lot of growth in the near term,” said Vaibhav Chaturvedi, an economist, who leads Council on Energy, Environment and Water’s work on Low-Carbon Pathways. India’s short-term targets include increasing non-fossil fuel power capacity to 500GW by the end of the decade from 450GW. Half of India’s energy will come from renewable sources by 2030. India’s 2030 carbon intensity goal — measured as carbon dioxide emissions per unit of gross domestic product — will be increased from 35% to 45%. The country will also strive to produce half of its electricity using renewable energy and cut carbon dioxide emissions by 1 billion tons l by 2030. The targets will require major financial investments and skilled workers for the deployment of renewable energy.“We are trying to clarify with the government if it is talking about meeting 50% of India’s energy requirements from renewable energy by 2030. It is not possible. Then you are referring to all sectors. Realistically speaking I think they are referring to 50% installed capacity for electricity from renewable energy,” Chaturvedi said. India’s installed capacity from renewable energy sources is already 39.8%. Chaturvedi said when it comes to cutting CO2 emissions by 1 billion tonnes, the government may be referring to the cumulative emissions that will be avoided by 2030 because of India’s rapid deployment of renewable energy.“This is an unprecedented bold announcement from the Prime Minister [Narendra Modi]. This is more ambitious than either the EU and Chinese announcements. For an economy that is expected to grow fast for the next two decades, even peaking in the next 20 years is not an easy feat. This announcement will shake Indian and global energy markets and give a sense of much-needed long-term certainty to investors in the energy domain.” Chaturvedi said the enhanced ambition of the 2030 target makes the net zero announcement even more credible. “The Prime Minister has stamped India’s leadership in the climate discourse. Any ambitious target would have its share of challenges.” He said the biggest near-term challenge is in electricity market design and distribution sector reforms. “For the longer term, it would be managing the human resources in the coal sector. Skilled human resources for the new shape of energy markets would be critical. So, challenges galore, but strategic planning would help see us through.”Nicholas Stern, chair of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, London School of Economics and Political Science, said India’s annual greenhouse gas emissions will peak by 2030.In a statement on Monday, he said, “This was a very significant moment for the summit, with Prime Minister Modi pledging stronger action by India on climate change, with five new targets. These include a further increase in clean energy to 500 gigawatts by 2030, a reduction in the emissions intensity of its economy by 45% by 2030, and net zero emissions by 2070.” He added together this might mean that India’s annual emissions of greenhouse gases could peak by 2030.The statement called on the developed countries to follow India’s example. “This demonstrates real leadership, based on a track record of action and ambitious targets, that can deliver on both economic development and climate change, from a country whose emissions per capita are about one-third of the global average.” It added the rich world must respond to Modi’s challenge to deliver a strong increase in international climate finance.Sandeep Pai, who studies energy security and climate change at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said achieving India’s short-term targets will require major reforms and large-scale finance.“India’s net zero pledge is bold. For a developing country that has not even carbonized to talk about decarbonization is ambitious and sets the targets clearly. However, the devil will be in the details or in other words what would be the exact plans to achieve this target. In the absence of these plans, this pledge will not mean much. By when India will have to peak to meet the pledge will really depend on the sectoral pathway the country will follow. For example, when will the coal use peak in the power sector?” Pai added India’s 2030 targets are achievable but not easy at all. “From DISCOM reforms, raising large-scale finance for the deployment of renewables, managing land issues, to aligning Centre-state climate policies will be key determinants of whether India will be able to meet its 2030 targets or not.”India needs to adopt transformational changes in its energy mix to be able to transition to net zero emissions by the mid-2060s, according to the India Energy Outlook report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) released in February. For India to achieve net zero emissions, energy demand in 2040 should fall nearly 30% below the projected level, based on current policies, with a complete switch from traditional biomass-based energy. India will have to shift away from coal. Solar photovoltaic cells will have to take up coal’s share of electricity generation a full decade ahead of what current policies envisage, the IEA report said.In a tweet, Sunita Narain, the director general of Centre for Science and Environment, said India enhanced NDC is a challenge to the world to step up. “We will reduce 1 billion tonnes by 2030; 22% reduction in BAU; per capita will be 2.31 tonnes/as against US 9.4 t/per capita and China 9 t/per capita. No question that this is running the talk #COP26 ,” she tweeted. “Yes, and for the world to go #netzero in 2050; China should go by 2040 and OECD countries by 2030. This is why #NetZero is inequitable and makes combatting #climatechange unambitious and ineffective. We deserve better #COP26Glasgow. RE target of 50%; non-fossil fuel 500 GW; carbon intensity of 45% are all pathways to get to 1 billion tonne carbon emission reduction by 2030. India has laid out its roadmap; this is more than OECD and certainly what China has done.”Many experts said China has not committed to much more than what it had promised in 2016. Lauri Myllyvirta, the lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, tweeted: “China’s new climate commitment under the Paris agreement has been published. It turns the 2060 carbon neutrality target and CO2 emissions peak before 2030 into new formal pledges but doesn’t shed more light on the emissions trajectory over this decade.”China’s role gains importance considering the carbon budget numbers. A carbon budget is the cumulative amount of CO2 emissions permitted over a period of time to keep within a certain temperature threshold, according to Carbon Tracker. According to a recent analysis by the Centre for Science and Environment, in the coming 10 years, China will take up 33% of the remaining carbon budget of 409 GtCO2 and India may occupy only 9.54%. Between 1870 and 2019, China occupied 13.4% of the global carbon budget; India 3.16% and the seven historical polluters - United Kingdom, US, European Union, Russia, Japan, Australia, and Canada - 60.53%.The share changed quite a bit between 1990 and 2019 when China occupied nearly 21% of the carbon budget. This means China went through a very intense phase of development mainly dependent on fossil fuels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/when-will-india-peak-before-reaching-net-zero-emissions-top-experts-weigh-in-101635850474595.html

The directions by the Union government came amid the ongoing 'Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav' event being organised across the country.The coordination division in all the ministries and departments have been asked to furnish the ATR on the subject "all ministries/ departments to put up a preamble wall in their office premises" in the e-Samiksha Portal.The portal is a real-time online system, directly monitored by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Cabinet Secretariat to check the progress of schemes and projects in all ministries. It plays a key role in measuring performance in the government.The Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) has also directed all the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) to "put up a preamble wall" in their office premises and submit their ATR to the ministry by this evening, reported ANI further.The recent directions to the Forces follow the October 28 order, where the MHA directed Border Security Force (BSF), Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB), Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), National Security Guard (NSG) and Assam Rifles to "furnish the action taken report" in respect of their organisation to it through e-mail.However, the order does not mention any specific criteria of preamble wall, all the CAPFs are engaged in the process to fulfil the direction on time.The then minister Prakash Javadekar on November 26, 2020, had inaugurated the preamble wall at the premises of the ministry of environment, forest and climate change on the occasion of Constitution Day. The same year, the department for promotion of industry and internal trade, as well as the department of personnel and training, also unveiled it. Similarly, some other ministries and departments also unveiled preamble walls in their office premises as per the Centre's order.The preamble mentions "we, the people of India, having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic, republic and to secure to all its citizens: Justice, social, economic and political; liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship; equality of status and or opportunity, and to promote among them all; fraternity assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the nation""In our constituent assembly this twenty-sixth day of November 1949, do hereby adopt, enact, and give to ourselves this constitution," mentions the preamble.The order was again sent to all the ministries and departments as we celebrate Constitution Day, also known as National Law Day, in India on November 26 every year to commemorate the adoption of the Constitution of India, as well as at the same time we are celebrating Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav.The official journey of "Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav" commenced on March 12 this year which started a 75-week countdown to India's 75th anniversary of independence and will end post a year on August 15, 2023.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-orders-all-ministries-departments-to-put-preamble-wall-in-office-premises-report-101635846840946.html
02-11-2021||India||Money laundering case: Anil Deshmukh sent to ED custody till November 6||A sessions court in Mumbai sent former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh to the Enforcement Directorate's custody till November 6 in connection with a money laundering case. The agency had sought extended custody of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader, whom they arrested after 12 hours of questioning late on Monday.The court allowed Deshmukh's application for home food and medicines during his ED custody and the presence of his lawyer during the interrogation by the agency.Deshmukh has been booked under various sections of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).He was produced before additional sessions judge PB Jadhav, who presided over the special holiday court, a little after noon.While Additional Solicitor General of India (ASG) Anil Singh and Hiten Venegaonkar argued for the Enforcement Directorate, senior counsel Vikram Chaudhary and Aniket Nikam defended the former Maharashtra home minister.Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) registered an FIR against Deshmukh on charges of bribery, corruption and criminal conspiracy after allegations were made against the politician by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh who said that the NCP leader asked dismissed assistant inspector Sachin Waze to collect ₹100 crore from hotels and bars in Mumbai every month. Deshmukh resigned in April after the FIR was registered.ED started its investigation based on the CBI's case.NCP leader Nawab Malik said on Tuesday that the action against Deshmukh is politically motivated and meant to defame the three-party ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance in Maharashtra."After exploring all the legal means, he appeared before ED. He is being framed. The one who made the allegations against him (Anil Deshmukh) is absconding," said Malik."Where is Param Bir Singh? He left for Chandigarh and never returned to the city since then. There are only three ways to escape, of them one is by air and another is by road. A person can go to Nepal by road either through Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh or Bihar and BJP is in power in all these three states. Was Param Bir Singh helped to escape; MVA was defamed through him? BJP needs to answer all these questions,” he added.Deshmukh, 71, appeared before the ED on Monday after skipping multiple summons. In a video message released yesterday, he said that all the allegations against him are false. "Today, I have presented myself before the Enforcement Directorate. Former Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh made false allegations against me. Where is he today? As per media reports, he has left the country," said Deshmukh.The NCP leader appeared before the investigating agency after the Bombay high court on Friday rejected his petition challenging the ED summons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/money-laundering-case-anil-deshmukh-sent-to-ed-custody-till-november-6-101635849997130.html
02-11-2021||India||Kerala HC refuses to entertain former SFI leader’s habeas corpus plea||A division bench of the Kerala High Court on Tuesday declined to entertain a habeas corpus petition filed by former leader of the Students Federation of India (SFI) Anupama S Chandran seeking to produce her baby who was given up for adoption by her parents last year. A division bench of Justices Vinod Chandran and C Jayachandran observed that the child was not in illegal custody but with adoptive parents now. Besides this, the family court in Thiruvananthapuram is hearing the issue in detail and there is no need of any intervention at this juncture. The court directed the counsel for Chandran to either withdraw the petition or it will be rejected on Wednesday when it takes it up again. In the petition, Chandran argued that the newborn was given for adoption without her knowledge and all norms were flouted. She said she was in the dark about the baby for more than a year and often her parents give conflicting information about the adoption. She said the baby was forcibly removed from her on the third day of delivery and given up for adoption in August with the connivance of officials of the state council for child welfare. Police had registered a case on Oct 20 after Chandran approached them complaining that her parents forcibly took away the newborn last year and gave it for adoption in a hurry, bypassing her request to live with the newborn. Later, the police registered a case against six people including her parents. On Monday, a family court in the state capital ordered a DNA test to resolve the complaint about the controversial adoption of the newborn. Her father, Jayachandran, said he sent the baby to the government-run children’s home with his daughter’s consent. She signed on a stamp paper to that effect, he said, but the former said she did so under duress. Chandran’s one-day fast before the state secretariat last week for her child attracted national attention.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-hc-refuses-to-entertain-former-sfi-leader-s-habeas-corpus-plea-101635848437882.html

According to UK watchers, the claims of high turnout in the voting to decide whether Khalistan should be carved out of Punjab is being projected by Pakistani media.A majority of the voters were backed by Pakistan, the people cited above said, adding that the total number was less than 2,000.The Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), which organised the referendum, failed to get even 100-150 voters in the first half and various outfits associated with the Khalistan movement - like Federation of Sikh organization (FSO) and World Sikh Parliament (WSP) - pressed their workers to come and vote, said UK watchers. SFJ is a banned organisation in India.The organisers had pressed into service buses to ferry people from different parts of the UK, but even they couldn't bring a large number of people, said the people cited above.The UK watchers further said that there were just 53 buses, which brought people from different parts of the UK to the voting centre. The location was Westminster in central London, but not even 50 people turned up with their private vehicles, they said.The diplomats based in London said that there was no verification if the persons arriving for the referendum were Sikhs, Pakistanis or Afghans. Coverage of the event also showed that the same set of people were brought in to vote repeatedly, they added.The SFJ had called all the Sikhs above the age of 18 to vote in the referendum. Those who indeed came to take part in the exercise shouted pro-Khalistan slogans and carried the Khalistan flag.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/turnout-less-than-2-000-khalistan-referendum-in-london-a-damp-squib-101635847760168.html

Counting was underway held for bye-elections for 29 assembly and three Lok Sabha seats.These instructions were issued earlier this year when there was a surge in Covid-19 cases right after the counting for assembly elections held in Assam, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Bengal and Kerala. The EC had banned victory processions during or after the declaration of election results after the Madras high court held the election monitor accountable for the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/byepolls-election-commission-issues-reminder-of-ban-on-victory-processions-101635847054565.html

The prosecution case even if proved, only amounts to an offence of smuggling of gold, which will come under the Customs Act and not UAPA. It is only a Customs offence, at the worst. And for the Customs offence, the petitioners have already been granted bail," Suresh’s lawyer had said."There is no legal evidence of an expert witness that the alleged activity will lead to the destruction of economic stability under Section 15 of UAPA. The final report filed by the NIA at the Special Court does not include any evidence whatsoever that such proceeds have been utilised to finance terrorism as alleged," the lawyer added."While some of the accused in the matter were released on bail already, the rest were denied bail on the sole ground that a deeper probe was necessary for the facts narrated in the FIR, regarding funding terrorism and involvement of transnational forces. From the final report, it becomes clear that no such links with terrorism or transnational links could be established by the investigating agencies," the petition said. (With inputs from bureau) and agencies||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-gold-smuggling-case-hc-grants-bail-to-key-accused-swapna-suresh-101635843261617.html
02-11-2021||India||Income Tax dept attaches properties allegedly linked to Ajit Pawar||The Income Tax department has provisionally attached properties in Maharashtra, Delhi, and Goa allegedly linked directly and indirectly to Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, officials aware of the matter said on Tuesday.The action was taken after the department allegedly discovered unaccounted income of about ₹184 crore during searches it carried out at 70 premises of two Mumbai-based real estate groups, individuals, and entities allegedly linked to Pawar and his family in Mumbai, Pune, Baramati, Goa, and Jaipur last month. The department said incriminating documents, evidencing the unaccounted income were found during the raids.The department is yet to issue any statement on the attachment but officials cited above said the action was taken under the Prohibition of the Benami Property Transactions Act. The attached assets include an office building at a prime location in Mumbai, a flat in a posh Delhi locality, a resort in Goa, agricultural land, and a sugar mill in Maharashtra, the officials said.Also Read: I-T dept rolls out new annual info statement; taxpayers can give feedbackFunds obtained in a “dubious manner” were allegedly utilised for the acquisition of these properties, they added.HT has reached out to Pawar for comments and the copy will be updated accordingly.After the searches, the department claimed there was a suspicious flow of funds allegedly involving an “influential family from Maharashtra,” without naming Pawar or his family. The department officials, who spoke off the record, said the influential family was that of Pawar.The department carried out searches including at the residences of Pawar’s three sisters and son, Parth. Pawar then called the agency’s action harassment. He alleged the department was being misused against his family for political reasons.The agency said the searches led to the identification of transactions by business groups with a web of companies that, prima facie, appear to be suspicious. “A preliminary analysis of the flow of funds indicates that there has been an introduction of unaccounted funds in the group by way of various dubious methods like the introduction of bogus share premium, suspicious unsecured loans, receipt of unsubstantiated advance for certain services, collusive arbitration deals out of non-existent disputes, etc,” the agency said in its statement last month.It added the value of assets allegedly acquired through funds obtained in a “dubious manner” was about ₹170 crore. The department claimed to have seized unaccounted cash of ₹2.13 crore and jewellery worth ₹4.32 crore during the five-day search operation.Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief and Ajit Pawar’s uncle, Sharad Pawar, reacted strongly to the searches saying the action reeks of abuse of power. He linked it to the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) reaction to his position on the Lakhimpur Kheri violence. Sharad Pawar likened the violence to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre during the Indian national movement.Union minister Ajay Mishra Teni’s son has been arrested in connection with the Lakhimpur Kheri violence that was triggered after a car ran over a group of protesting farmers.NCP is part of the Shiv Sena-led government in Maharashtra, which has had frequent run-ins with the BJP-led central government over the alleged misuse of central agencies.BJP leader Kirit Somaiya alleged Pawar and his family own the properties attached. “The properties include Jarandeshwar sugar factory worth ₹600 crore, an office owned by Parth Ajit Pawar in South Mumbai worth ₹25 crore, a flat in south Delhi worth ₹20 crore, and a resort named NIlaya in Goa worth ₹250 crore. The properties... are owned by Ajit Pawar, his wife Sunetra, his mother, his son, sisters, and Mohan Patil, son-in-law.”Ajit Pawar last month refuted allegations that he and his family bought the sugar factories for paltry prices. “There are no irregularities involved in the purchase of any sugar factories. The factories were auctioned following all norms,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/income-tax-department-attaches-properties-allegedly-linked-to-ajit-pawar-101635843214039.html

Issuing a notice to the Delhi Police, the women's body described this as a matter of “serious concern,” which, it said, deserves “immediate attention.”Also Read | T20 World Cup: Virat Kohli slams trolls of Mohammed Shami as ‘pathetic’“DCW has issued a notice to police over a threat made on Twitter to rape Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma's daughter.

The post was made from the account @Criccrazygirl; the handle has since been deleted. However, some netizens have claimed that the tweet was made from a Pakistani account.In its notice to the police, the DCW sought to be informed, by November 8, on the following counts: Copy of FIR registered in the matter, details of accused identified and arrested, details of steps taken to arrest the accused if no arrest made thus far, and detailed action taken report.While Kohli's captaincy, and the Indian team's performance at the ongoing World Twenty20 event in the UAE has triggered criticism from fans, it was his support for teammate Mohammed Shami that triggered the ire of a section of social media. On October 30, a day before India's second match in the tournament, against New Zealand, the India number three had thrown his weight behind pacer Shami, the only player Muslim in the side, following the team's 10-wicket defeat in its opening fixture vs arch-rivals Pakistan, on October 24.This was India's first-ever defeat to Pakistan in a World Cup, 50-over or 20-over; the Men in Blue's head-to-head record in World Cup matches against the neighbours now reads 12-1. Follwing its defeat in the second match as well, the team now needs to win all three of its remaining fixtures, by huge margins, to have any chance of qualifying for the semifinals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dcw-issues-notice-to-delhi-police-over-online-threats-to-virat-kohli-s-family-daughter-101635839724082.html

The YSR Congress leaders requested President Ram Nath Kovind to derecognise TDP."All our MPs met President today and explained to him the filthy language used by TDP functionaries, particularly Chandrababu Naidu, his son Lokesh and spokesperson Pattabhi against our party and leader Jagan Mohan Reddy. We've requested the President to derecognise TDP," said YSR Congress leader and Member of Parliament V Vijayasai Reddy, who was part of the delegation."TDP has become a terrorist party, an anti-social party. It doesn't have confidence and doesn't follow democratic principles. Therefore, a party that doesn't believe in democracy loses the moral right to contest elections," Reddy told reporters outside the President's House.The YSR Congress leader also said that they have urged the President to direct the law minister to bring contempt legislation similar to Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 to punish the Andhra Pradesh opposition party leaders for using such filthy language.The visit comes a day after TDP leaders met Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sushil Chandra and demanded the ruling YSR Congress Party be derecognised for "provoking anarchy and giving rise to state-sponsored terror" in Andhra Pradesh.In their representation to the chief election commissioner (CEC), the TDP leaders accused the YSRCP of promoting enmity in the name of caste and religion to divert people's attention, and violating multiple legislations governing the conduct of lawmakers and executive bodies.The YSR Congress too had sought a similar step against the opposition TDP in a meeting with the CEC.The issue came to limelight last month when thr YSR Congress accused TDP spokesperson of making objectionable comments against chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy in a press conference.The caustic remarks were made by TDP spokesperson K Pattabhi Ram in reaction to police notices sent to former minister Nakka Ananda Babu.The YSR Congress workers ransacked TDP's headquarters at Mangalagiri, offices at Visakhapatnam and other places over the issue.TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu had met President Kovind last month, demanding that President's Rule be imposed in the southern state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/terrorist-party-ysr-congress-leaders-meet-president-seek-tdp-s-derecognition-101635840548856.html

02-11-2021||India||PM Modi’s climate action commitments leave room for India's economic growth||Prime Minister Narendra Modi's commitment towards climate action with India promising to achieve net zero emissions by 2070 appears to have been taken with global strategic landscape in mind. His speech at the COP26 indicates that India is all for saving the planet without inhibiting India's economic growth and at the same time monitoring other countries walk the talk on countering climate change.Coming straight to Glasgow from G-20 summit in Rome, PM Modi's statement takes into account the reality that India has the lowest per capita income in the top twenty grouping with Indonesia, South Africa ahead on multiple figures and China nearly four times ahead. That PM Modi did not spell out the peaking year also indicates that India has lot of economic growth potential in near future. And with better technology options available to India during the projected period of growth, the country will be in far more synergy with the global climate change objectives.“PM Modi has tried to balance climate action with realistic assessment of resource position. He has made commitments by keeping the space for India’s economic development. The commitments are etched in stone unlike others who are all talk and no action,” said a former foreign secretary.The fact is that PM Modi not only spoke for India but took upon himself to be the voice of global south at both the G-20 and the COP26. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Monday night tweeted: “When it comes to climate action, India has delivered on its Paris commitments and has now set out ambitious goals at Glasgow. This reflects in our determination to shape key global outcomes and make our fullest contributions. India will count where it matters. When it comes to climate justice, we will speak our mind and flight for Global South. History shall not be repeated.” EAM Jaishankar also asked that countries which makes promises of greater climate finance should also be held accountable and that financing like mitigation should be monitored closely.Climate change was also one of the main agendas at the G-20 conference with covid vaccine, Afghanistan and Islamic radicalization being the other big issues facing the world. But the global order, trust and transparency and resilient supply chains in the context of Indo-Pacific was the under-current of the Rome summit.While PM Modi met key leaders at the G-20 and the COP26 including French President Emmanuelle Macron and Australian PM Scott Morrison, EAM Jaishankar had a nuts and bolt meeting with his US counterpart Antony Blinken with detailed step by step focus on Afghanistan and the growing Islamic radicalization in the Indian sub-continent as well as the Indo-Pacific.While the response to PM Modi’s climate action is expected to be revealed later today, it is quite evident that India has put up a positive agenda at the COP26 with a room for maneuvering country’s future economic development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-s-climate-action-commitments-leave-room-for-india-s-economic-growth-101635836056163.html

02-11-2021||India||Support for BJP fell after 2019 Pulwama terror attack, claims new study||A new study published in the American Journal of Political Science (AJPS) has concluded that the 2019 terror attack in Kashmir’s Pulwama district - in which 40 members of India’s security forces were killed - had a negative impact on the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) support base in areas where it was the incumbent party.Milan Vaishnav, a senior fellow and director of the South Asia Program at Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, and Jamie Hintson, junior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, jointly wrote the research paper titled: “Who Rallies Around the Flag? Nationalist Parties, National Security, and the 2019 Indian Election”.Vaishnav, who rolled out the paper’s argument in a series of tweets, wrote, “At a macro level, it’s widely accepted that the 2019 Pulwama terror attacks in Kashmir generated nationalist rallying that aided the BJP’s re-election campaign. Yet, we find those most acutely affected by the attacks were much less likely to rally behind the BJP.”Also Read: NIA raids multiple locations in J-K in Jamaat-e-Islami caseThe study claimed that nationalist governments in general are often well-placed to make the most of security-related crises and they are inclined to have hawkish views on national security policy.However, Vaishnav argues in his paper, “Using granular booth-level data on electoral outcomes and village-level data, we find that proximity to the Pulwama victims’ funeral processions substantially ‘reduced’ BJP support in areas where it was the incumbent.”“Our effects cannot be explained by prior electoral behavior, spatial correlation or personal connections to victims,” Vishnav wrote. “While several mechanisms could be at work, the preponderance of available evidence points to anti-incumbent blame as the principal driver [behind the presumed fall in BJP support].”BJP spokesperson Gopal Krishna Agarwal played down the research paper’s argument, saying that such a sweeping conclusion cannot be drawn on the basis of just one survey.“There are very huge negative impacts of the Pulwama attack. But the strong action taken by the government had brought out a very positive image of [Prime Minister Narendra] Modi that he means business,” Agarwal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/support-for-bjp-fell-after-2019-pulwama-terror-attack-claims-new-study-101635822572977.html

02-11-2021||India||UP assembly polls: With focus on women, Congress changes strategy||Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Monday promised a bonanza of benefits for women including two in every five government jobs for women in the state if the party comes to power, ahead of the state elections slated for early next year. The announcement comes weeks after the party promised 40% tickets for women.Gandhi also announced that women would get annually three cooking gas cylinders for free and they won’t need to buy tickets in state government buses. She also promised scooties and smartphones for girl students—a leap from the usual poll promises of bicycles. Party insiders claimed that all these measures are aimed to create a class-based vote bank for the Congress that had rapidly lost its erstwhile vote-base in the post-Mandal politics to Samajwadi Party, BSP and the BJP in UP and Bihar.“Priyanka has established her as the face of the Congress in UP and many women look up to her as their favourite leader. She is also looking at the broader picture and trying to reach out to a broader section,” said a senior strategist, requesting anonymity.A party insider also revealed that the women-centric announcements were a result of a strategy in which both Priyanka and Rahul Gandhi were involved. Among the other steps, Priyanka announced monthly ₹10,000 for all Asha and anganwadi workers. Gandhi also announced widow pension of ₹1000 per month and 75 vocational schools across the state.The poll promises also signal a new style of campaign and a tactics to pre-empt the manifesto of other parties. In the last UP assembly polls, the Congress bagged just 6.25% popular votes and seven out of 403 seats in UP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-assembly-polls-with-focus-on-women-congress-changes-strategy-101635814357331.html
02-11-2021||India||Private sector firm set to make small arms||Indian weapons company SSS Defence will begin manufacturing and testing small arms at its new facility that will be operational in Bengaluru in January 2022, with the complex also housing a first-of-its kind underground weapons testing tunnel to determine their effectiveness, the firm’s CEO Vivek Krishnan said on Monday.“This will be our first full-fledged facility where we will carry out integrated research and development, manufacturing and testing of weapons,” he said. Security audits by the ministry of home affairs are currently on at the manufacturing unit.In a needed boost to the government’s Make in India campaign, the weapons factory will make SSS Defence the second private sector company in India to manufacture small arms for the local and export markets after PLR Systems Ltd (PLR), a joint venture between Adani Group and Israel Weapon Industries (IWI).The 150-metre-long tunnel will be the first underground facility to be set up by a private sector company in the country for testing and evaluation of weapons ranging from pistols and assault rifles to carbines and sniper rifles, people familiar with the matter said. The testing process allows manufacturers to gather crucial tactical weapon data including muzzle velocity, action time and consistency.Experts said the development was an indicator of the small arms manufacturing business coming of age in the private sector and the Indian military and paramilitary would have cheaper indigenous options to choose from.The four-year-old firm SSS Defence emerged as the lowest bidder for a contract to upgrade a small number of Indian Army’s AK-47 assault rifles, beating off competition from established Israeli rival Fab Defense, as reported by Hindustan Times on Sunday.Thus far it has built prototype weapons such as assault rifles and sniper rifles at a ‘bridge’ or make-shift facility in Bengaluru, and the new facility will allow the Bengaluru-based firm to ramp up annual production to 20,000 assault rifles and 3,000 sniper rifles depending on orders, Krishnan said.PLR is working on its first order to supply Masada 9mm pistols to the Indian Navy’s elite marine commandos, said one of persons cited above. The JV is manufacturing at its Gwalior facility the complete range of IWI weapons such as Tavor assault rifles, X95 assault rifles, Galil sniper rifles, Negev light machine guns and Uzi submachine guns.The weapons to be manufactured at SSS Defence’s eight-acre unit at Jigani near Bengaluru’s well-known technology hub, Electronic City, include the Viper and Saber sniper rifles, P-72 assault rifles and the P-72 carbines, Krishnan said. The weapons facility represents an investment of around ₹200 crore.The company is also setting up an ammunition manufacturing plant at Anantapur in Andhra Pradesh that is expected to be operational next year.Achieving self-reliance in the small arms sector is critical, said military affairs expert Lieutenant General DB Shekatkar (retd).“Apart from the military, paramilitary organisations and state police forces need to be equipped with quality small arms for better response,” said Shekatkar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/private-sector-firm-set-to-make-small-arms-101635814498850.html

The month-long door-to-door vaccination campaign aims to inoculate the entire population in poor-performing districts.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is currently at Glasgow in the United Kingdom, is also set to hold a Covid-19 review meet as soon as he returns to India after attending the COP26 climate conference. According to reports, the coronavirus review meeting will focus on districts with low vaccination coverage, those areas which have less than 50 per cent coverage on the first dose and low coverage on the second dose as well.After a Covid-19 review meeting with the health ministers of states and Union territories last week, Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya informed the media about the ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ campaign to ramp up the vaccination drive. “We are going to launch a mega vaccination campaign ‘Har Ghar Dastak’. We have decided that for the next one month, healthcare workers will go door-to-door to vaccinate people eligible for the second dose and also those who have not taken the first dose,” said Mandaviya.According to the Union minister, 77 per cent of the eligible population in India has been vaccinated against Covid-19 with the first dose while 32 per cent of people have received both doses.“More than 10 crores people have not taken the second dose of vaccine,” he added. “People who are eligible for the second dose should take the vaccine.”Highlighting the need to accelerate the pace and coverage of vaccination, he stated that there are more than 10.34 crore people in the country who have not taken the second dose after the prescribed interval. As several countries report a high number of Covid-19 cases, the ramping of vaccination drive in India to reduce severity becomes crucial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/har-ghar-dastak-india-to-launch-mega-vaccination-drive-today-against-covid19-101635811445547.html

02-11-2021||India||Will give free pilgrimage if voted in, says Arvind Kejriwal||Ahead of the state polls due early next year, Aam Aadmi Party president and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday promised free pilgrimage to the four religious places-- Ayodhya, Shirdi, Velankanni and Ajmer Sharif -- if their party is voted to power in Goa.“If we form the government we will facilitate an Ayodhya pilgrimage and opportunity for a darshan for Hindus. For the Christians, we will give a free Velankanni pilgrimage (in Tamil Nadu) and for the Muslims, we will give a free Ajmer Sharif pilgrimage (in Rajasthan). I’ve been told that for many people in Goa prefer a pilgrimage to Shirdi, so they will get a free pilgrimage to Shirdi (in Maharashtra),” Kejriwal said addressing a press conference in GoaThe announcement of a free pilgrimage is the third in a list of ‘guaranteed’ promises that the AAP leader has offered the people of Goa after previously promising free, uninterrupted power supply and an unemployment allowance. While Ayodhya and the shrine of Sai Baba in Shirdi are offered as options for Hindus, Christians are offered an opportunity to the Church of Our Lady at Velankanni in Tamil Nadu and a free trip to Ajmer sharif the tomb of revered Sufi saint, Moinuddin Chishti, located in Rajasthan’s Ajmer is on offer for Muslims.“I’m not promising anything new. Our pilgrimage scheme in Delhi has been going on for a few years now. Over the last two years it was stopped due to the pandemic. But prior to that 35,000 people took advantage of the scheme. People get a choice of where they want to go. Everything is paid for by the government,” Kejriwal said.Kejriwal said that he was prompted to announce the scheme for Goa after he visited Ayodhya. On October 27, the Delhi government approved the inclusion of Uttar Pradesh’s Ayodhya in the Delhi government’s free pilgrimage scheme for senior citizens.The Delhi chief minister also took on rival political parties, who he said were only interested in power games and not bothered about the issues facing the people of Goa. “We are making a whole plan for the development of Goa. But here they (other political parties) are talking about alliances. In the morning they say they will ally with one party. In the evening it is someone else. Is anyone even thinking about Goa? Every time I come to Goa I talk about mining, about land rights, about health, education, women programmes, industry, trade. We are making a plan for every sector that affects the people of Goa. Is anybody else doing this? Nobody is worried about Goa,” Kejriwal said.Kejriwal was initially in talks with Goa’s Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party for a possible alliance, but the negotiations broke down. He, however, didn’t rule out an alliance ahead of the pollsResponding to Kejriwal’s poll promises, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party spokesperson Urfan Mulla said, “These are hollow promises given on the eve of Diwali much like the fireworks that explode with a bang but soon fizzle out.”Congress spokesperson Amarnath Panjikar also attacked the AAP president and said, “There are so many issues of Goa that he could have spoken about instead he is here trying to lure people with the carrot of religion.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-give-free-pilgrimage-if-voted-in-says-arvind-kejriwal-101635798427747.html
02-11-2021||India||Ex-minister Anil Deshmukh grilled by ED for 12 hours, arrested at midnight||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) late on Monday arrested former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh after questioning him for 12 hours in connection with its money laundering probe in an alleged extortion racket, people familiar with the development said.Officials who didn’t want to be named said Deshmukh was placed under arrest under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) just around midnight on November 1, as he was “evasive during questioning” and there was sufficient evidence of laundering against him.The NCP leader appeared before ED for the first time on Monday after skipping multiple summons issued to him for past four months. The central agency even issued a lookout notice against him as the agency could not reach him all these months.A First Information Report (FIR) was registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) against Deshmukh in April to probe allegations that he asked dismissed assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze, currently behind bars in the February 25 Antilia bomb scare conspiracy as well as murder of businessman Mansukh Hiran on March 5, to collect ₹100 crore every month from hotels, bars and restaurants in Mumbai.A chargesheet has already been filed on August 23 against Deshmukh’s personal secretary Sanjeev Palande and personal assistant Kundan Shinde under PMLA, in which it has been alleged that while serving as Maharashtra home minister, Deshmukh misused his position, and through Vaze, collected ₹4.7 crore from Mumbai’s bars for their “smooth functioning”.During investigation, ED identified 24 private entities that are controlled by the Deshmukh family and found that huge sums of money were transacted among them without any rationale.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/exminister-anil-deshmukh-grilled-by-ed-for-12-hours-arrested-at-midnight-101635800071153.html
02-11-2021||India||How the bad air battle turned the tide for once-thriving Sivakasi||Velavan Fireworks, established in 1983, is not the beehive of activity it used to be ahead of Deepavali. In a corner of its 36-acre compound is a small office, out of which N Kartheeswaran, the second-generation owner of the factory, works.There are at least 50 manufacturing sheds inside the campus, each painted in white with blue doors. The bigger sheds usually have four workers to a space, the smaller ones hold two. This year, several sheds are shut. The factory had 150 workers until 2020. It has between 50 and 70 now.Many of the workers are women. Their children have nowhere else to be, so next to their mothers, they play in groups, swaying from makeshift swings made from old blankets and sarees hung from the ceiling. By the middle of the day on October 20, even before lunch, two workers approach Kartheeswaran and ask what to do next. Their work for the day is done. Two weeks before Diwali, in Sivakasi, the question borders on the absurd.“If we have another situation like last year, there is no way our factory, or the industry will survive,” Kartheeswaran says.In September 2017, the Supreme Court banned the use of antimony, lithium, mercury, arsenic, lead and strontium nitrate in firecrackers, hearing a case filed in 2015 by the legal guardians of three Delhi based children who argued for a complete ban to protect their right to a pollution-free environment. A year later, in 2018, the apex court held that only “green crackers” would be allowed. This year, the Supreme Court on Friday, October 29 clarified that “green firecrackers” were allowed, but reiterated the ban on those that contain barium salts and “joined crackers”, a staple of the industry. The apex court said: “Celebration cannot be at the cost of the other’s health.”In 2020, just before a week before Diwali, seven states banned the sale and use of firecrackers. This year Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh have allowed green crackers, while in Punjab, Tamil Nadu and Odisha, they are allowed for two hours on Diwali. Haryana has announced a blanket ban in 14 districts, allowing green crackers in areas where AQI is “moderate” and above. The Calcutta high court on Friday ordered a complete ban on firecrackers in West Bengal, which the Supreme Court set aside on Monday, allowing green crackers.A Asaithambi, president, Sivakasi Fireworks Manufacturers Association (SIFMA) says that if production was affected by 25% in 2020, it has already dropped 40% this year.As India grapples to control the heavy toll taken by the annual winter pollution with at least nine Indian cities among the world’s worst 10, according to the World Air Quality Report 2020 — converting some northern metropolises into veritable gas chambers in the winter, the fallout of bad air shortening lifespans and causing serious ailments among the vulnerable — the firecracker industry, close to a hundred years old, is on its knees.THE BEGINNINGSIn 1923, two men from Virudhunagar, P Ayya Nadar and his brother Shanmuga Nadar, travelled to Kolkata to learn the skill of making matches. They returned in eight months, convinced they had struck gold. Soon, the Nadars, a powerful community in Tamil Nadu, began setting up factories. The factories, which originally made matches, were owned by the Nadars, while those that worked in them were predominantly women and Dalits. Within a few years, fireworks began to emerge, beginning with sparklers. As machines began taking over the match business, the workforce began to turn to fireworks by the late 1920s.As the industry grew, people, including child labourers, began migrating to Sivakasi from the neighbouring districts of Madurai, Tirunelveli and Thoothikudi. Across India, most fireworks were still being imported, but this was curtailed during the Second World War. In 1940, the government passed the Indian Explosives Rules which licensed the manufacture, sales and storage of fireworks, and the industry exploded.Much of the land where factories, such as Velavan, now stand, is agricultural in an area that is not conducive to farming, with dry weather and low rainfall. Until they began the factory in 1983, Kartheeswaran’s family had grown spinach. “There was no water and barely any hope in agriculture. We only began to grow when firecrackers began,” he says.THE SLIDESivakasi produces firecrackers worth an estimated ₹6,000 crore every year, 90% of the volume produced in India. According to the Virudhunagar district administration, there are 1,010 factory units. Of these, 269 are licensed by the district revenue office and 741 by Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organization (Peso). The number of workers employed directly is 150,000 and workers in the allied industries -- offset printing, paperboard, retail and transport -- are close to 500,000, according to Virudhunagar district collector J Meghanath Reddy.Factory owners say the total number of people working in fireworks and allied industries in the region could be around 800,000.After the Supreme Court’s orders in 2017 and 2018, sections of the industry began manufacturing green crackers using formulae prescribed by CSIR-NEERI’s (National Environmental Engineering Research Institute). According to the NEERI website, one such new formulation of light-emitting crackers named ‘STAR Z’ uses 32% potassium nitrate, 40% aluminum powder, 11% aluminum chips, and 17% proprietary additives to reduce PM10 and PM2.5 emissions by 70%. Peso approved these new formulations in 2019.In Sivakasi, there is still a great deal of confusion on what “green crackers” are. “The confusion lies in not knowing the definition of green crackers. This is supposed to be clearly defined by the central government but there is no consistency…The alternatives that are recommended for green crackers are four times as expensive. In just 2021, every three months there has been a revision in the prices of aluminium powder and metal power,” says Prasanna Gunaram, the 31-year old, third-generation owner of Ramsons Fireworks.Fireworks manufacturers have also made a plea to the Supreme Court to allow barium nitrate, which they argue is a “safe” oxidiser. “90% of conventional crackers need barium nitrate. NEERI has offered a formula where an additive to this composition will reduce emissions. But as of now barium nitrate isn’t permitted, Peso will not allow these crackers, and therefore our number of manufactured items have reduced,” Asaithambi said.In the middle of the crisis and the confusion, came Covid.When the national lockdown was enforced in March 2020, the industry downed shutters for 55 days. When they reopened, only 50% of their workforce was allowed to work. “We didn’t know what to produce. Because of the unpredictability, production was very low and some factories couldn’t afford to pay workers,” says Asaithambi. The industry’s busiest months are from July to October, ahead of Diwali. “From December to April we produce orders for the marriage season and temple festivals but this completely stopped due to Covid.”In 2021, factories were also shut throughout May due to the second wave. Orders from across the country are usually placed by wholesalers immediately after Diwali, up until May. “This year the production has fallen further because our buyers have stock in excess. So they either limited their orders or just didn’t buy,” says Prasanna Gunaram.THE WORKERSWorkers begin walking into the Velavan factory by 6.30am. There is a canopy of trees around the factory, and it is early in the day, but it is already warm. “It’s the chemicals,” says Kumaravel Pandian, the foreman who decides what chemicals are mixed in which shed, the type of knife to be used to cut threads, and most things else. Only those who qualify in the “explosive licence exam” held by Peso can be employed as foremen. Pandian once ran a small business selling raw materials for matches, but it turned unviable in 2004. “If not for this job, I wouldn’t have been able to get my daughter married,” he says.Next to him, 40-year-old Amul Raj is bathed in striking silver. Raj has the riskiest job in the enterprise -- mixing the chemicals. For his own sake, he has to finish by 11am, for then he runs the risk of his body heat rising to unhealthy levels, combined with the strong sun. Raj has been doing this for 15 years before which he was loading crackers for transport. Now he earns ₹500-600 a day, double what he once did. It is this job that has brought his family a respectable living, the prize for the tenuous dance between life and death he lives everyday.Working with them is the 65-year-old Victoria (who gave only one name), brought to the factories as a child labourer, as a Class 5 student. Back then, she earned 40 paise a day for making a 100 “joined crackers”. She married a factory worker and has five sons, none of whom works in the industry. “When you go to bed drinking just water every day, you follow what everyone else does to survive,” she says.At 65, she is frail but her hands have the deftness of a surgeon, as she wraps plastic around multiple two-sound crackers in seconds. Earning between ₹150 to ₹170 a day she now can afford a lunch box which she shares with the three stray dogs that call the factory home. She echoes a sentiment common in the region. “Who else will give us work now? If they (the factories) don’t remain open, it’s a death knell,” she says.THE DEBATEWith the threat of closure looming, the industry has been appealing to the Union Environment Ministry since 2017 to exempt fireworks from the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986. “We are eligible for exemption since pollutants from crackers don’t stay in the air for more than 48 hours. People burst crackers only for two days during Deepavali and now, for only for four hours a day with the new restrictions. Our industry doesn’t pollute like thermal power plants, cement factories, construction, vehicles and stubble burning,” Asaithambi claims.Environmentalists do not agree, but they acknowledge that it is time the government creates a transition plan for the labour force.“We have to acknowledge that this is a sunset industry,” says Dharmesh Shah, public policy researcher who works on air pollution and is a senior advisor for Lawyers Initiative for Forests and Environment (LIFE). “The science is very clear that contamination, especially heavy metal pollution, is extremely high in firecrackers. Green crackers are safer but not pollution-free.”Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) have been agitating for the implementation of Employees’ Provident Fund and Employees’ State Insurance to be strictly implemented by all factory owners. “We are also appealing for a minimum wage of ₹18,000 per month to be fixed for all the workers,” says V N Jothimani of Crackers and Matchbox Employees Association. “Everyone is desperate for a job. They’re going even if they get only ₹100 a day and they sleep over at factories so that they don’t miss out on any work.”THE FUTUREManickam Tagore, the Congress MP from Virudhunagar, says that there is a desperate need for a long-term plan. “The biggest strength of the industry has been adapting to the times. It brings revenue to the government and creates jobs. We have the capacity to compete with China which exports fireworks to Australia, the US and the UK. But instead government agencies are targeting this industry and creating several bottlenecks.”Back at Velavan Fireworks, there is no next rung of generational leadership of the factory waiting after Kartheeswaran. He had studied till Class 12, and after trying his hand at unsuccessful businesses, returned to the family business. But there is now a distaste for the work among their children. While Kartheeswaran’s daughter is still in school, his niece work as a nurse and nephew as a mechanical engineer. “No one has the mindset to come back here and struggle through this.”Still, there will be time to worry about that later. For Sivakasi, much depends on this pivotal week. Kartheeswaran and his employees, like everyone else in Sivakasi, are hoping there are no additional last-minute bans.“That’s the difference between life and death,” he says. An ironical, but serious, fallout of India’s air emergency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-the-bad-air-battle-turned-the-tide-for-once-thriving-sivakasi-101635794082176.html

02-11-2021||India||Confusion over resignation of Punjab advocate general||Chandigarh: Confusion prevailed amid reports of resignation of Punjab advocate general, Amar Preet Singh Deol on Monday, as by evening, Deol denied that he has resigned from the post On Monday afternoon, senior officials in chief minister’s office confirmed that Deol met chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi and tendered his resignation. However, by evening APS Deol denied that he had resigned. “I met the chief minister since cabinet was to meet. Probably, this led to speculations. I have neither been asked nor resigned,” Deol said. Meanwhile, Channi ducked questions about Deol’s resignation after the cabinet meet. Soon after Channi appointed Deol as state’s advocate general on September 27, Punjab Congress Committee chief, Navjot Singh Sidhu had resigned from his post, criticising his appointment and also that of director general of police Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota. Sidhu has been adamant on his replacement since then and conveyed the same to the central leadership of the Congress. Deol, 61, was a counsel for former director general of police Sumedh Singh Saini in the 2015 post sacrilege police firing incidents and secured his release. Several Sikh organisations had also opposed his appointment arguing that how a person who defended those accused in sacrilege cases, could be appointed an AG. To counter the criticism, Deol, brought in noted criminal lawyer Rajwinder Singh Bains as special public prosecutor to defend these cases. However, this move also ran into controversy as Bains in the past had appeared for one complainant in sacrilege cases. Last week, the government had to give an undertaking to the high court that Bains will not appear in post sacrilege violence cases till November 23. All these cases are politically sensitive and important for the new government that has to face the assembly election within four months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/confusion-over-resignation-of-punjab-advocate-general-101635795274437.html

Six candidates from Sindgi and 13 from Hanagal are contesting the polls. “In both constituencies, we will win with a very big margin . The election went off very well and there have been voting in large numbers. I am fully confident that In both places, our candidates will emerge victorious,” Basavaraj Bommai, the chief minister, said on Monday. Bommai had tasked his entire Cabinet to the bypoll-bound constituencies to secure a victory and increase the party’s strength in the legislative assembly. The chief minister is also trying to prove his leadership and cement it among the disgruntled seniors of the state unit, who were overlooked for the top post when Yediyurappa stepped down. Hanagal was earlier held by the BJP and falls in Haveri, the home district of Bommai, making it a prestige battle for the chief minister. Bommai had even stated that the results of these polls will serve as an indicator of which way the 2023 assembly polls are likely to go.Sindgi was earlier with the Janata Dal (Secular) and fell vacant after MC Managuli passed away in January. His son Ashok Managuli is fighting on a Congress ticket from the constituency. The Congress, meanwhile, continued to attack the Bommai government over the Bitcoin scam. “.@CMofKarnataka has said that the state investigating agencies have conducted comprehensive investigation & the case has now been referred to ED & CBI.What was the need to hand it over to ED & CBI if the State agencies had done it properly?” senior Congress leader Siddaramaiah said in a post on Twitter on Monday.He added that there were allegations that around 5,000 bitcoins, to the tune of around ₹2,600 crore was purchased. “As per news reports, in chargesheet filed by CCB police, it is recorded that the accused has looted 5000 Bit coins through unethical hacking. Who holds these Bit coins now? Have they got it transferred to accounts of investigating agencies? Or are they clueless,” he wrote. “It raises lot of suspicion about the conduct of State govt when we read news reports about bitcoin scam. Instead of targeting those who question the scam, @CMofKarnataka should present the facts in front of the people,” Siddaramaiah further said.The senior Congress leader also openly invited Srinivas, the JD(S) legislator from Gubbi to join the party and even assured the latter a ticket in the 2023 elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-will-win-with-a-big-margin-in-sindgi-hanagal-bypolls-karnataka-cm-bommai-101635795156020.html

According to a statement from the department, disciplinary action was taken against 29 traffic police personnel in September for violating towing and other traffic enforcement procedures. Another eight officers were penalized this past week in October for checking vehicle documents in the absence of any visible traffic violation. In September, among the 29 officers to be punished were 17 police constables, eight head constables, three assistant sub-inspectors, and one police sub-inspector. As part of the disciplinary action, some officers have been suspended as well, said police. Apart from its own officers, the department has also suspended 32 towing vehicles and have permanently taken eight towing officials off duty. Joint commissioner of police, traffic, BR Ravikanthe Gowda, said that action was taken based on the complaints that have been received from the public. He also asked commuters to communicate with the higher authorities if any traffic police officer stops them for a random document check. “We do conduct special drives to collect pending fines from vehicle drivers, but it is conducted during non-peak hours. During these rides, if someone doesn’t have any pending fines they are allowed to go. But if there is any, then the vehicle document verification will take place even if there was no visible traffic violation at that particular time,” Gowda said. Meanwhile, the city traffic police have decided to impose fines of up to ₹1,000 on those using bluetooth-enabled devices for communication while riding or driving. As per the amended Motor Vehicles Act use of any mobile devices while driving has been brought under the ‘dangerous driving’ category and attracts a fine of up to ₹5,000 or up to one year jail or both. While police said that use of the mobile devices for navigation will be allowed, Bengaluru traffic police said that using headphones for navigation will be punishable. According to police, the first violation of rule will attract ₹500 fine, while the fine for the second violation will be ₹1,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/29-bengaluru-traffic-police-officers-face-action-for-violating-norms-101635795092045.html
02-11-2021||India||Karnataka government launches Janasevaka scheme offering home delivery||Bengaluru Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Monday launched the ‘Janasevaka’ scheme offering 58 government services at the doorstep of citizens. In the first phase, the scheme will be available in all 198 municipal wards in Bengaluru. “To get the benefit of any service, the system that exists makes it very difficult. The situation is such that there is dipping confidence among citizens that their job will be easy when they walk into offices and we wish to make this easier,” Bommai said on Monday in Bengaluru. The chief minister said that the scheme would be implemented throughout Karnataka from January 26. “Through this Janasevaka scheme, the government will reach the doorstep of every house. Under the programme, various services such as caste certificate, property Khata certifcate, old age and widow pension schemes will be provided,” he told reporters in Malleshwaram. Bommai said that there exists a situation in which citizens are forced to cough up money and the Janasevaka programme would help avoid these irregularities that have added to the ‘wall” between government services and the citizens. After laucnhing the programme at Vidhana Soudha to commemorate Kannada Rajyotsava, Bommai visited homes of 10 selected residents in Malleshwaram where he delivered residential certificates, income and caste certificates, widow pension, labour card, senior citizen card, Aadhar card and Ayushman health cards to them. “Ours is a pro-people government, which is reaching the doorstep of individuals. People’s faith in democracy strengthens when these essential services directly reach the citizens,” he said, adding that even PDS (public distribution system) would be added to the list of services Under the scheme, citizens will be charged a facilitation fee of Rs115 along with department fee for the requested service. Printing charges will be added wherever applicable, according to the government. The Jana Sevaka pilot project was launched in T. Dasarahalli assembly constituency of Bengaluru North on March 2, 2019 and was extended to three more assembly constituencies eventually. The scheme had seen over 95,000 applications received through Janasevaka.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-government-launches-janasevaka-scheme-offering-home-delivery-101635794973048.html

Our main job is to protect the right to privacy and right to not be discriminated against.” His reference is to the right to equality, freedom of speech and expression, and the right to life and personal liberty.“FAQs have been prepared to bring clarity as well as to explain the nuances of the due diligence to be followed by intermediaries”, the preface to the primer said. It added that the document “is in response to general queries received by MeitY. It is not a legal document and in no way whatsoever replaces, amends or alters any part of the IT Act/ IT Rules, 2021.”“In order to ensure an Open, Safe & Trusted Internet and accountability of intermediaries including the social media intermediaries to users, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) has notified the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 (hereinafter referred to as “IT Rules, 2021”) on 25th February, 2021,” the document states. “These Rules prescribe the due diligence to be followed by all intermediaries as well as the additional due diligence to be followed by significant social media intermediaries. The Rules also provide guidelines to be followed by publishers of news & current affairs and also online curated content providers.”The document release Monday is different from the standard operating procedure (SOP) that the ministry is working on, which the minister said will address the contentious issue of which designated authority is allowed to issue take down orders. Chandrasekhar also clarified the government’s position on traceability, a clause that been challenged by messaging service WhatsApp in court. “As far as first originator is concerned, the government believes that when criminality occurs online and there is a legal valid order, then there are methods where without breaking encryption, it can be traced,” he said. “Cyber space cannot be a space where laws cannot reach.”Social media firms welcomed the intervention. “We appreciate the government’s efforts in bringing more clarity on the 2021 IT Rules. We look forward to studying the FAQs,” a Meta (earlier called Facebook) spokesperson said.Kazim Rizvi, founder of The Dialogue, a policy think tank said that the FAQs will be crucial in helping the intermediaries to better appreciate the finer nuances of the guidelines , but that a SOP is crucial.“These FAQs accord clarity regarding the operational aspects of some of the crucial provisions. For instance, they lay down the details of the requisite information that needs to be communicated by the law enforcement agencies to the intermediaries while issuing a takedown notice,” he said. “With respect to the data retention mandate, the explainer provides that Section 61 C of the IT Act alongside the IT (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information) Rules, 2011 must be referred to determine the kind and extent of user data that needs to retained by different kinds of intermediaries.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mos-chandrasekhar-releases-social-media-guidelines-faqs-says-cyberspace-needs-regulation-101635794972522.html
02-11-2021||India||Superstar Puneeth Rajkumar’s eyes give new lease of life to four||Bengaluru: Four corneal blind patients received eyesight, thanks to Kannada actor Puneeth Rajkumar. The actor’s eyes were donated on Friday afternoon soon after his demise.Dr Bhujang Shetty, Chairman, Narayana Nethralaya hospital on Monday said that all four patients are between 20 to 30 years of age and have been on the waiting list for over 6 months. “Due to the pandemic, the number of donations had reduced, and the waiting list was getting longer. So we made the best use of available donations and instead of two, we were able to do the successful transplant in four patients on October 30.” said Shetty. Explaining the process, he said that usually two corneas from a donor are transplanted into two corneal blind patients. “But in the case of actor Puneeth Rajkumar, his corneas were sliced into four parts. The front portions went to two different patients and the rear ends went to two other patients,” he said. “The outer or superficial part of the cornea was transplanted to two young patients with corneal dystrophy and keratoconus. Both these conditions affect the superficial layer of the cornea. The inner or deeper layer of the cornea was transplanted to two patients with corneal endothelial decompensation affecting the innermost layer of the cornea,” he elaborated. The four patients — a woman and three men — are from Karnataka and are doing well after the surgery. “Finding suitable recipients for the procedures was a challenge. We sought help from B.L. Sujatha Rathod, director of the state-run Minto Ophthalmic Hospital,” he said. The limbal rim (white part of the eye near the circumference of the cornea) that was not used for the transplants, has been sent to the laboratory to generate ‘Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells’ for potential use in patients with Limbal Stem Cell Deficiency, chemical injuries, acid burns, and other serious disorders, he added. Meanwhile, leader of Opposition Siddaramaiah on Monday urged the union government to consider Puneeth Rajkumar for Padma Shri award. “I urge @PMOIndia to award Padma Shri posthumously to Puneeth Rajkumar. His acting & contribution to society deserves even more accolades,” he tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/superstar-puneeth-rajkumar-s-eyes-give-new-lease-of-life-to-four-101635794971084.html
02-11-2021||India||Congress leader’s statement on Telangana-Andhra reunion kicks up a row||HyderabadTelangana Pradesh Congress Committee working president T Jayaprakash Reddy’s statement calling for a merger of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh states has landed the party in an embarrassing situation.Reddy, better known in political circles as Jagga Reddy, told reporters on Sunday that he would favour the reunion of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh which were separated in June 2014 after the passage of the AP Reorganisation Act in parliament.He reminded that he was always in favour of a united Andhra Pradesh. “When the Telangana movement was at peak, too, I argued strongly against bifurcation. Some people called me a betrayer of Telangana but still I could win as an MLA. Now the talk of united Andhra Pradesh has surfaced again and I strongly support it,” Reddy, also a lawmaker from Sangareddy assembly constituency, said.It all started with a remark made by Telangana Rashtra Samithi president and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao at his party’s plenary held in Hyderabad last week that there were requests from the people of Andhra Pradesh to launch the TRS in their state, as they were impressed by the welfare and developmental programmes being implemented in Telangana.A day later, Andhra Pradesh minister for information and public relations Perni Venkaramaiah alias Nani pooh-poohed KCR’s remarks. “There is no objection if KCR wants to launch the TRS in our state. But instead, he can ask the Centre to reunite both Telangana and Andhra so that there is no need to launch a separate party here. His TRS can as well contest the elections in this region,” Nani said.Telangana PCC president A Revanth Reddy alleged that KCR had colluded with Andhra leaders and was conspiring for the merger of the two Telugu states again. “Congress president Sonia Gandhi had granted statehood to Telangana when the UPA was in power, after a prolonged struggle by the people. Now, KCR wants to launch the TRS in Andhra, to see that eventually both the states are reunited,” he criticised.Against this backdrop, the PCC working president’s comments that he also favoured merger of both the Telugu states created tremors in the party. But Jagga Reddy defended his comments saying they were purely his personal and had nothing to do with the party.“I know the people of Telangana are not demanding the merger of two states. Yet, it is my considered view that it should happen. Nobody, including the PCC chief, can question my right to express my views,” the MLA said.PCC campaign committee chairman and ex-MP Madhu Yashki Goud said the party would not endorse Jagga Reddy’s comments on the merger of the two Telugu states. “Sonia Gandhi had granted statehood to Telangana only to undo injustice done to the region in the united Andhra regime. Any statement from any leader questioning her decision would only be his personal,” Goud said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-leader-s-statement-on-telangana-andhra-reunion-kicks-up-a-row-101635794729800.html
02-11-2021||India||Missing gun may dent Gauri Lankesh case prosecution||Bengaluru: Even as a special court in Bengaluru on Saturday framed charges against 18 accused in the Gauri Lankesh’s murder case under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, Arms Act and Karnataka Control of Organised Crimes Act (KCOCA), however, one missing link in the case could prove to be a chink in the armour as the police have not been able to recover the pistol used to commit the crime. The trial of the case will finally begin after more than four years since the journalist turned activist was shot dead outside her Bengaluru home on September 5, 2017. The trial is also crucial as Lankesh’s murder is also connected to the killing of other rationalists – MM Kalburgi, Govind Pansare, and Narendra Dabolkar. With all suspects in custody and the Supreme Court upholding the Special Investigation Team’s (SIT) decision to slap Karnataka Control of Organised Crimes against them, the police are confident of a victory in the case. Just days after the murder, balletic experts had concluded that a 7.65mm country-made pistol was used to murder Lankesh. The investigation revealed that 10 days after the murder, one of the accused, Sudhanva Gondhalekar traveled to Bengaluru and collected the murder weapon from a rented house in Seegehalli, where the accused was staying after the attack. Gondhalekar handed over this weapon to Sharad Kalaskar, an associate of his. After key members of the gang that killed Lankesh were arrested in May 2018, Kalaskar was given instructions to dispose of the weapon. In 2019, SIT got custody of Kalaskar, and he revealed where he had thrown the weapon. “We also decided to remove the slide and barrels of these three pistols and dispose them. The remaining parts could be used in making other weapons. Likewise, I selected the three pistols, removed the slide and barrels, and put them in a bag. Vaibhav Raut and I took off in Raut’s car and threw these parts into a river from a bridge on the Mumbai — Nashik highway on July 23, 2018, at about 9:00 pm. The remaining parts of these weapons, I gave to Vaibhav Raut who kept him at his house in Nallasopara,” read Kalaskar’s confession statement. The SIT roped in a dredging agency to find the weapon from the creek, but after months of dredging, the SIT has decided to give up on the search. The SIT is confident that they can secure a conviction even without the murder weapon. “We have made all attempts to recover the weapon, and this has been conveyed in the charge sheet. At the same time, one of the accused in his statement has said that he disposed of the weapon to destroy evidence. The other strong evidence we have provided in the case would conclusively prove the murder and the conspiracy,” said a senior SIT official. While the case evidence provided by the SIT could prove the murder, but in order to prove the larger conspiracy to murder rationalists, which is one of the reasons for slapping charges under organized crime, the weapon would be crucial. Especially since the Lankesh trial is expected to help the investigation into the other three murders, which are at crossroads now. The SIT investigation also unearthed a link between the murders of four rationalists – MM Kalburgi, Govind Pansare, Narendra Dhabolkar, and Lankesh. During the initial days of the investigation, the SIT found a connection between the murders of Lankesh and professor Kalburgi, who was killed on August 30, 2015. The four bullet slugs and cartridges recovered from Lankesh’s house matched with the slugs and cartridges of the Kalburgi murder case. The forensic labs found that both bullets were fired from the same gun. The Maharashtra SIT, which is probing the murder of another rationalist, Govind Pansare, also found that the same was used in Lankesh and Pansare murders. The link between the murders of Lankesh and Narendra Dhabolkar, another Maharashtra-based rationalist, murdered on August 20, 2013, emerged during the later stages of the investigation. It was found that 50-year-old Rajesh Bangera, a second division assistant in the Education Department, who was the 10th person arrested by Karnataka SIT, provided weapons training to the killers of Dhabolkar and Lankesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/missing-gun-may-dent-gauri-lankesh-case-prosecution-101635794550401.html

The car was found in a mangled state and it took enough time to retrieve the trapped.Police said they got some CCTV visuals from the area, but it was not clear what exactly triggered the accident. Relatives of Kabeer and Shajan said they were close friends and worked together on several modelling projects. Both the women went to Kochi for a fashion show, their relatives said.Kabeer, a resident of Attingal in Thiruvananthapuram, had won the Miss Kerala title in 2019, and Shajan, reportedly a Thrissur native, finished runner-up that year.Police said after post-mortem bodies will be handed over to their relatives. “It seems to be an accident, we don’t suspect any foul play at this juncture,” said a senior police officer of Ernakulam.

02-11-2021||India||Supreme Court sets aside Calcutta HC’s complete ban on firecrackers in Bengal||The Supreme Court on Monday set aside the Calcutta high court order imposing a complete ban on sale and use of all firecrackers in the state, ruling that the high court departed from the legal regime established under the top court’s orders without any material to show inaction on part of the state or collusive approach by the authorities at the ground level.“We are convinced that if the high court wanted to impose complete ban, it should have asked the authorities to offer an explanation requiring such an extreme order and departing from the order passed by this court on October 29,” the bench of justices AM Khanwilkar and Ajay Rastogi observed at a special sitting to hear this case as the courts have closed for Diwali vacation.On October 29, the Calcutta high court held that it found no evidence to establish that there was a mechanism to ascertain that only green crackers were being sold or burst, and went ahead to prohibit the sale of even green crackers ahead of the festive month beginning with Kali Puja, Diwali, Chhatt Puja, Jagadhatri Puja, Guru Nanak’s Birthday and extending till Christmas and New Year celebrations.The high court verdict came on the same day the Supreme Court ordered states and Union territories to comply with its order prohibiting the sale of banned firecrackers but made it clear that there was no blanket firecracker ban, because green crackers can be used during the festival.Two fireworks dealers’ association, Burrabazaar Fireworks Dealers’ Association and Siliguri Fireworks Dealers Association, rushed to the Supreme Court against the high court ban, pleading that they have already received their stocks from Sivakasi in Tamil Nadu and the last-minute ban jeopardised their interests ahead of the festival season.The dealers represented by senior advocates Siddharth Bhatnagar and Malvika Trivedi recalled the top court’s direction on Friday, laying down clearly that there is no complete ban on firecrackers and use of green crackers and improved crackers (with reduced emission) are permitted.The bench agreed. “All states are following the order passed by this court. How can West Bengal be an exception? Our order has to be consistent in all areas unless as a matter of policy, any state decides to impose a ban (on sale or use of firecrackers),” it said.To be sure, a blanket ban on all types of firecrackers including the ‘green’ ones is in place in Delhi where the prohibition is effective till January 1 next year in view of the worsening air pollution. The Odisha government earlier banned firecrackers in the interest of protecting general public health but on Monday, the Odisha high court allowed green crackers to be sold ahead of Diwali but has stipulated that these should only be burnt between 8pm and 10 pm.Senior advocate Anand Grover appearing for West Bengal government told the court that the state government was also taken by surprise by the high court ruling. “The order came as a bolt from the blue as the high court never discussed it when the PIL was heard and suddenly made it part of the order,” Grover said.He also produced figures indicating that last year, over 100 First Information Reports (FIRs) were registered against people found selling illegal crackers in Kolkata resulting in the arrest of 243 persons. Similar figures were provided for the years 2018 and 2019 as well. This year too, 10 persons were arrested in connection with seven FIRs, Grover stated.Lawyer Rachit Lakhmani, appearing for Roshni Ali who petitioned the high court for a ban, told the Supreme Court that crackers are being burst near hospitals and prescribed silence zones in violation of the Supreme Court’s repeated directions to states to have community cracker bursting at designated places.The bench said, “There may be people of all kinds but that does not mean there should be a complete ban. Instead, the mechanism has to be strengthened to prevent abuse of our orders. The high court has not defined what the practical realities are to pass such an extreme order. Even the state did not have the opportunity to present facts.”The bench said that over the years, the top court specified the legal regime regarding ban on fireworks and to depart from that regime, there must be some material to show inaction on part of the state or collusive approach by police and officials at the ground level.The top court accepted the assurance given by the state that in the event of any inaction on part of its officials to curb illicit fireworks, “appropriate remedial and corrective steps will be taken.”Senior advocate Gopal Shankarnaraynan, who last week argued for a blanket ban on firecrackers, said the top court’s October 29 order was passed in the context of manufacturers while the present petition concerned dealers. He reiterated that most firecrackers produced in Sivakasi were mislabeled ‘green crackers’ with fake QR codes as they contained the chemicals including barium salts already banned by the Supreme Court in October 2018.“The same logic laid down by this court on October 29 for manufacturers shall apply to traders,” the bench said asking the state to abide by the top court’s order. Adding further, it said, “West Bengal government may explore the possibility of ensuring no banned fireworks or related items are imported within the state and be verified at the entry point itself. This mechanism can be strengthened in addition to the strict supervision and verification at other places where trading or utilization of such fireworks takes place.”The bench said the petitioner or any person was free to place all relevant documents before the high court, “which after giving opportunity of hearing to the WB government and WB Pollution Control Board may proceed to pass orders as may be advised.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-sets-aside-calcutta-high-court-s-complete-ban-on-firecrackers-in-bengal-101635794312903.html
02-11-2021||India||Will rename Mumbai-Karnataka region as ‘Kittur Karnataka’, says CM Bommai||Bengaluru Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Monday reiterated that the state government would rename Mumbai-Karnataka region as ‘Kittur-Karnataka’, saying the former title holds no meaning since there were no ties between the two after the restructuring of states in 1956.“We have recently renamed Hyderabad-Karnataka region as Kalyana Karnataka. We have now decided to rename Mumbai-Karnataka region as ‘Kittur Karnataka’ in the coming days,” the chief minister said, adding, “After the reorganisation, the border issue has been settled. Is there any meaning to Mumbai-Karnataka?” The announcement was made during the Karnataka Rajyotsava, which is celebrated to commemorate the formation of Karnataka state 65 years ago. The Mumbai-Karnataka region, which was formerly under the Bombay presidency, became part of Karnataka in 1956.While Karnataka celebrates Kannada Rajyotsava on November 1, the Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti (MES), a group of native Marathi speakers, observe a black day as they claim to have been forcibly separated from their parent state 66 years ago during the reorganization exercise. The renaming has two benefits- one is to shrug off any ties to Mumbai and Maharashtra as well as naming the region after 19th century ruler, Kittur Rani Chennamma, the followers of whom are now the Panchamasalis, the largest subsect within the Lingayats. In 2012, the state government inaugurated the Suvarana Vidhana Soudha, a replica of the Vidhana Soudha in Bengaluru, where it holds the winter session of the state legislature, to further thwart any claims of territory from the neighbouring state. However, the region still have native Marathi speaking residents, who continue to raise the inclusion of Belagavi and surrounding regions into Maharashtra and often clash with pro-Kannada organisations in the border district.“Renaming the region does not change the topography of marathi culture or have any impact on our movement,” Deepak Dalavi, the president of the MES said. He added that Rani Chennamma is a revered figure and had written to the British, seeking permission for adoption in Marathi language.Dalavi further said that there has been no change in the lives of the Marathi people who have been forced to move away from their roots.Bommai said the changes in the region should have happened in 1956 when the State Reorganisation Act came into effect. Stating that mere renaming is not sufficient until the standard of living of the people in that region improves and development takes place, the chief minister said the regional imbalance and disparities should also go and all the regions should grow together. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government is making efforts to end regional disparity with a vow not to leave any region in the state underdeveloped, Bommai said. “We are also committed to prepare an action plan for the development of ‘Kittur Karnataka region’,” he said.Speaking on the occasion of Kannada Rajyotsava, when, 65 years ago, the erstwhile state of Mysore was renamed as Karnataka with several parts of other provinces becoming part of the state. Kittur Rani Chennamma was the ruler of Kittur, who led an armed rebellion against the British in the early 1800’s. She was from the Panchamsali community, the largest sub-sect of the Lingayat community, who have intensified their demands to be included in the 2A or most backward category in the state reservation list.Influential seers and other leaders of the Panchamsalis have demanded that their reservation-related request be met at the earliest, failing which the community would revive its agitation. Influential Panchamsali seers and leaders have demanded that their reservation-related request be met at the earliest, failing which the community would revive its agitation. The community has already started to mobilise support for its cause and the government continues to reassure the group of appropriate action.Kudalasangama-based Panchamasali Mutt seer Jagadguru Basava Jaya Mrityunjaya Swami, who is leading the agitation, had on October 21 made a veiled threat to the government demanding action on their reservation request or expect a backlash in the October 30 bypolls, as reported by HT.He demanded that the government should get the report from the backward classes commission over the reservation. “There is some discontentment among the people. Last time when the results of Maski and Belagavi came, the media showed it was the impact of Panchamasali discontentment,” the seer had said.“This is one kind of politics to pacify our community (Panchamasali). In the bypolls, one of the Congress candidate is from our community. In Hanagal, we have 60,000 people and even in Sindgi we are the deciding vote but they (BJP) did not give one of us a ticket. Because they didnt give us a ticket they are trying to pacify us by giving such statements,” Vijayanand Kashappanavar, former MLA of Congress party and president of Akhila Bharatha Lingayat Panchamasali Mahasabha said on Monday. Going into the history of Kannada and Kannadigas, Bommai said there were Kannadiga rulers who ruled the neighbouring states such as Kadamba, Chalukya, and Vijayanagara empires.Bommai said Kannada displayed its unique internal strength to survive even in the face of onslaught by foreign invaders. “Even when rulers from other regions took reins here, Kannada managed to save itself. The language withstood the attacks of foreign forces and is standing firm. It was possible because it has got its own internal strength, which we should never forget. No force can ever destroy Kannada,” the chief minister said. He also told the gathering that the funds for the Kalyana Karnataka region bordering Telangana will be doubled in the next budget and ₹3,000 crore will be allocated for the purposeThe CM said the government has given utmost importance to Kannada, making the language compulsory in the higher education under the new National Education Policy (NEP). He also said his government has made efforts to teach engineering in Kannada medium.The Bommai government had to face criticism on at least three occasions since he took over from his predecessor BS Yediyurappa in July this year, over a visible absence of Kannada in official programmes.Bommai emphasised that his government wants the Kannadigas should get up to 75% jobs in jobs in government, private and semi-government industries in Karnataka.Earlier, Bommai offered his obeisance to Bhuvaneshwari Devi, the mother Goddess of Karnataka, and hoisted the Kannada flag along with the national tricolour at the Kanteerava Stadium.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-rename-mumbai-karnataka-region-as-kittur-karnataka-says-cm-bommai-101635794190394.html
02-11-2021||India||Three students get perfect score in NEET-UG||New Delhi: Three students scored 720 out of 720 marks and shared the all India rank one in the National Eligibility Entrance Test (NEET) undergraduate 2021 examination, results of which were announced by the National Testing Agency (NTA) late on Monday. The exam, which was conducted across the country on September 12, witnessed a sharp jump of 10 percentage points in the attendance compared to last year.According to the NTA, which is the nodal agency to conduct various entrance exams in the country, a total of 1,614,777 candidates had registered for the country’s biggest entrance exam for admission to MBBS and BDS courses. Of which, 1,5 44, 275 or 95.63% appeared and a total of 870,074 candidates qualified the exam. Last year, 1,366,945 (85.57%) out of 1,597,435 registered candidates had appeared for the exam. Three students — Mrinal Kutteri from Telangana, Tanmay Gupta from Delhi, and Karthika G Nair from Maharashtra — have shared the top rank by scoring 99.999 percentile or cent per cent marks. A senior official at the NTA said that a “tie-breaking” formula will be applied during counselling for these three candidates. The NTA is yet to announce the formula. As many as 12 candidates have scored 99.998 percentile and shared rank 5 this year. The NTA announced the NEET-UG results after the Supreme Court on last Thursday stayed an order of the Bombay high court requiring the NTA to hold the re-examination for two students on account of a mix-up of test booklets before announcing the results.The NEET-UG was conducted across 3,858 centres amid strict precautions in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. A total of 681,168 male, 863,093 female and 14 transgender candidates appeared in the exam this year. “The examination was conducted for the first time in foreign countries (the UAE; Kuwait) also. It was also conducted for the first time in Punjabi and Malayalam medium, in addition to the existing 11 languages,” the agency said.The NTA has cancelled the results of 15 candidates after identifying the use of “unfair practices” in the examination, it said.Meanwhile, the qualifying marks saw slight decline this year. For instance, the qualifying marks range for unreserved category last year was 147 out of 720 marks, which came down to 138 this year. Similarly, other categories also saw the qualifying cut-off taking a slight decline. Delhi’s Tanmay Gupta, who scored 720 out of 720 marks, said, “A lot of times, people say that one needs to put in 14-15 hours on a daily basis to score well. I feel it’s more crucial to be consistent with preparations. Even if one dedicates 4-5 hours on a daily basis, the effort will pay off.” “Based on my experience, I can say that consistency is key and one can score well without putting in 14-15 hours,” Gupta added. Telangana’s Mrinal Kutteri said the lockdown period helped him in his preparations. “There was no time wasted on travel, studying from home could be very distracting. I made sure that I had an environment optimised for focused study. For instance, I did not have a mobile phone near me when he studied.” “I reduced my interactions with friends during the last month before the NEET exam. But I did not cut myself off from the outside world in the name of NEET,” he added.NEET-UG exam had come under scanner this year after at least three students died by suicide in Tamil Nadu fearing they would not be able to clear the exam. The Tamil Nadu government also passed a resolution, announcing that it will opt out of the entrance exam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/three-students-get-perfect-score-in-neetug-101635794070438.html
02-11-2021||India||AIADMK: Leadership crisis and caste politics||There is a deep crisis within the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) about the leadership struggle and competition amongst the key stakeholders such as Edapaddi Palanisamy (EPS), O Panneerselvam (OPS) and VK Sasikala. The AIADMK after the passing away of J Jayalalithaa is yet to find a leader who could obtain the undivided loyalty of its functionaries and communicate with the party cadre. The party is deeply divided and polarised on caste and sub-regional terms with dangerous implications for future. The party and its cadre are disillusioned with the three successive defeats – the 2019 parliamentary elections, the 2021 assembly elections, and the recently held local body polls.After the departure of Sasikala to Bengaluru prison and the exit of TTV Dinakaran along with his core loyalists, the pact between EPS and OPS was more to retain their power in government and the party was only a means. This power arrangement has survived and worked beyond everyone’s expectation, simply because of the support and backing provided by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to keep the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) out of power. The EPS-OPS pact would have ended in May this year with a remarkable success of the DMK but for the considerable number of seats won by the AIADMK to emerge as an opposition party with floor potential.The defeat of the AIADMK in the assembly elections held earlier this year and the spread of its winning candidates revealed an upper hand for EPS and the impending revolt from within was withheld until further notice. OPS continued to play along with him until the conditions portend a change of wind and along the way he has also been fine-tuning his tone of reconciliation and bridge building exercises with Sasikala through his seasoned emissaries. The BJP factor weighs heavily upon everyone’s mind when evaluating or trusting the moves of OPS. This is also the critical dilemma and source of discomfort between Sasikala and OPS negotiators.The uncertainty of the future and the absence of clear leadership are factors gripping the party as never before. In certain ways, generating a condition for the return of Sasikala and along with her TTV Dinakaran with his party and flag rolled up for the dream show. Sasikala is all set to walk the last mile coinciding with the Pon Muthuramalinga Thevar’s birthday celebrations and the cautious strategy of recapturing the party through democratic means. EPS is beginning to wither under multiple pressures of challenge to his leadership, threats of Kodanad case and the searches and raids conducted against the former colleagues and influential ministers during the AIADMK reign. EPS is sensing the heat and he knows the depths of distrust prevailing between him and OPS. He may even be ready to surrender but the bitter memory for Sasikala is too fresh to wane for any stake that he may concede. Sasikala is also aware that EPS is more vulnerable than ever before. OPS remains a pigeon in the BJP’s nest and unlikely to fly out without any trappings.There is chance for re-induction of Sasikala in the AIADMK without an inevitable split because of the clear absence of consensus about her leadership. The split and disaffection will be inevitable with her return. She has to wait and fight (plot) her way back. It will not be easy even after she succeeds. She must win the hearts of people, which she may not, because she will always be seen as a usurper of power.The crisis of leadership and the impending split from within also presents another challenge of the division being on the lines of caste and region as never before. Although Thevar community, in particular, Mukkulathor, at large have been a consistent vote bank for the party yet the AIADMK managed to retain other communities with good rapport and mutual benefits. This fragile consensus within the AIADMK will be tested beyond doubt and the regional polarisation of traditional vote bank will also affect the assessments in future.Dinakaran will be the largest beneficiary of this transition if it happens. OPS will also benefit with power and influence. Along with Sasikala, it is Dinakaran who will return to exercise power and clout within the party like before. An interesting proposition is that if Sasikala returns to AIADMK, she and her clan will keep the party under their control in the future. It will then emerge a condition that will force the destiny of the party to follow the infamous political culture witnessed in the country. The AIADMK will become a party of the family, like the Congress, Samajwadi Party, Rashtriya Janata Dal, DMK etc.(Prof. Ramu Manivannan is a scholar-social activist in areas of education, human rights and sustainable development through an initiative “Multiversity.”)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiadmk-leadership-crisis-and-caste-politics-101635793896304.html
02-11-2021||India||Biometric attendance in govt offices from November 8||Biometric attendance in government offices, which was discontinued after the Covid-19 outbreak, will resume from November 8 with adequate precautions, the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) said in a government order on Monday.The office memorandum -- which overrides a June 14 DoPT order continuing the suspension of biometric attendance -- means attendance registers will no longer be used in government offices.“Physical distancing of 6 feer must be maintained while marking attendance... additional biometric machines can be installed to avoid overcrowding,” said the latest order.“As far as possible the scanners should be placed in an outside/open air environment. If indoor, adequate natural ventilation should be maintained,” the office memorandum added. Meetings, however, will continue be to be done via video conference as far as possible and personal meetings with visitors are to be avoidedThe decision is in a series of moves being taken in different parts of the country as the caseload reduces after a brutal second wave. On Monday, India had 158,817 active infections -- from a high of 263,533 cases on May 18 this year, and down 455 cases from the day before.In June, DoPT asked officials of the rank of under secretary and above to attend office on all working days. Officials below the rank continued to work from office at 50% capacity, with staggered timings still in place. The department reversed its order from the third week of April, wherein the government brought back staggered timings and work from home for junior officials (deputy secretary and below) as the number of daily Covid-19 cases continued to rise at an alarming rate. A number of ministries, however, issued guidelines for work from home before the official DoPT memorandum starting April 15 when the country was recording neat 230,000 cases daily. These included the ministry of home affairs, consumer affairs, information and broadcasting and higher education. Most offices have now returned to full attendance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/biometric-attendance-in-govt-offices-from-november-8-101635793831403.html
02-11-2021||India||Madras HC quashes 10.5% Vanniyar quota, says Tamil Nadu law unconstitutional||The Madras high court on Monday set aside a Tamil Nadu legislation granting 10.5% reservation to the Vanniyar community within an existing 20% quota for the most backward classes (MBC) in the state, holding the law to be unconstitutional.A bench of justices M Duraiswamy and K Murali Shankar held that the 2021 law, passed by the previous All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) government the day state elections were announced, was illegal because of a lack of quantifiable data to measure the “extreme backwardness” of the Vanniyars.“…The impugned enactment has been passed by the state without any quantifiable data on population, socio educational status and representation of the backward classes in the services and the sub-classification done by virtue of the impugned act solely based on population data, in the absence of any objective criteria, is illegal in the eye of law and in violation of the Constitution of India,” the court saidThe court clarified that the order nullifying the reservation will not impact those who have been admitted to institutions under the quota.The Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK), which has been demanding reservation for Vanniyars, called the order a disappointment and urged the DMK-led state government to move the Supreme Court against the high court order. Government officials said they will consider moving Supreme Court against the order.The law carving 10.5% reservation for Vanniyar within 20% reservation for Most Backward Classes (MBCs) was notified by the previous AIADMK government on February 26, the day assembly elections were announced. When the present Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) government took over in May, it issued an order to fully implement the reservation, following which 35 petitions were filed in the high court.The petitioners, who belong to various castes in the MBC grouping, argued that the Vanniyar quota left little for the 115 other castes under the MBC umbrella. The state defended the enactment and submitted that institutions such as the Tamil Nadu Dr Ambedkar Law University had implemented the reservation and added that it would not affect the prospects of other communities.In its 184-page order, the court said that the sub-categorisation of reservation was done on recommendation of the chairperson of a commission without any quantifiable data on backwardness of the Vanniyars within the MBCs. It also said that all other members of the commission had dissented on the reservation recommendation.The commission headed by retired justice A Kulasekaran was constituted after PMK’s statewide protests for reservation in 2020. The commission is yet to submit its report on providing caste-wise reservation to all communities based on their population.The reservation was provided by amending Tamil Nadu Backward Classes, Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes (Reservation of Seats in Educational Institution and Appointments or Posts in the Services Under the State) Act 1993, which the state had enacted following a Supreme Court order to protect 69% caste-based reservation in Tamil Nadu.In most other states, caste-based reservation is capped at 50%.The court said that the legislation was in violation of Articles 15, 16 and 29 of the Constitution of India as it treated one caste- Vanniayars--differently.“By doing so, the respondents have shown discrimination between one caste having 6 sub-castes and 115 other castes, as the impugned Act tried to give higher proportion of reservation to one caste and deprive the others,” the court said.“We also find that none of the remaining 115 communities was given separate reservation, as it has been done in the case of Vanniyar caste.”The court added that “it is settled position of law that caste alone cannot be the basis for any classification” and the Supreme Court in the 1992 Indra Sawhney judgment made this clear.The court also said that the state had not taken a policy decision to modify the reservation after consulting the National Commission for Backward Classes as mandated by Article 338-B of the Indian Constitution and neither had any supporting materials been collected to prove that the Vanniyar caste was not able to compete with other extremely marginalised communities.“There is nothing on record to establish that the state government had deliberations with all the stakeholders, especially, those communities who would be affected by the impugned act,” the court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madras-high-court-quashes-10-5-vanniyar-quota-says-tamil-nadu-law-unconstitutional-101635793590288.html
02-11-2021||India||2013 Gandhi Maidan blasts: 4 sentenced to death, 5 awarded prison terms||PATNA: A special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court on Monday sentenced four of the nine men convicted for the 2013 serial blasts at Patna’s Gandhi Maidan to death, while the remaining five were awarded prison terms ranging from seven years to life term. Seven Improvised Explosive Devices went off on October 27, 2013, before a rally by Narendra Modi, then the Bharatiya Janata Party’s prime ministerial candidate. Six people were killed and 90 injured in the explosions. The additional district and sessions judge (XV) of the special NIA court, Gurwinder Singh Malhotra awarded capital punishment to Imtiyaz Ansari, Haider Ali alias Abdullah, Noman Ansari and Mohammed Mujibullah Ansari. Umar Siddiqui and Azharuddin Qureshi were sentenced to life imprisonment, Ahmed Hussain and Feroz Aslam were sentenced to 10 years’ rigorous imprisonment while Mohammed Iftekhar Alam was awarded a seven-year prison term. Five of the convicts — Haider Ali, Imtiaz Ansari, Umer Siddique, Azharuddin Qureshi and Mujibullah Ansari — are already serving life terms for the Bodh Gaya Mahabodhi blasts that took place just over three months before the explosions at Modi’s election rally. The court also imposed different quantum of fine on each accused. In its charge sheet, NIA said the accused planned the Patna bombings after they failed to get close to Modi at previous rallies in New Delhi, Chhattisgarh and Uttar Pradesh. The agency claimed the accused even carried out a dry run of a suicide bombing in Ranchi. The last bomb went off at 12.25 pm — 20 minutes before Modi and senior leaders took the stage. A total of 17 IEDs — seven of them had detonated — were found in and around the Gandhi Maidan. The nine were convicted on October 27 by the special NIA judge for planting and detonating the explosives. Special public prosecutor Lalan Kumar Sinha said the nine were convicted for criminal conspiracy, murder, attempt to murder, waging war against the government of India, conspiracy to wage war against the government, destroying evidence, explosives and railway act and the anti-terror law Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. Two of the accused, Imtiyaz Ansari (Gandhi Maidan) and Mohammad Tariq Ajam (Patna Junction), were injured in the incident and revealed the name of the other associates. Ajam died during treatment. Following their revelations, the Bihar police and NIA also managed to solve the Bodh Gaya blasts case. In the Bodh Gaya bombings, on July 7, 2013, 10 of the 13 IEDs planted went off, killing five people. Senior police officer Manu Maharaaj, who was Patna’s senior superintendent of police when the blasts took place, said Imtiaz’s arrest after his injury in an accidental blast at Patna railway junction on the day of Modi’s rally blew the lid off the conspiracy. “There would have been more blasts if the culprit were not arrested,” added Maharaaj. Former Bihar police chief Abhyanand told HT that they were happy with the court’s judgment. The former DGP added that due to team work, Bihar police managed to arrest one of the accused on the spot and averted stampede at the Gandhi Maidan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2013-gandhi-maidan-blasts-special-nia-court-sentences-4-to-death-prison-terms-to-5-101635793235678.html
02-11-2021||India||SP, RLD to tie up; no clarity if Akhilesh Yadav will contest poll||Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav announced on Monday an alliance with the Rashtriya Lok Dal for the upcoming elections in Uttar Pradesh was final but added that he will not be contesting the polls scheduled early next year. Hours after, an SP spokesperson appeared to walk back his comment, saying that the party was yet to decide on Yadav’s candidature. A former chief minister, Yadav has never contested an assembly election and is currently the member of Parliament from Azamgarh. “Our alliance with RLD is final. Seat sharing is to be finalised,” he told PTI in an interview. RLD, led by Jayant Chaudhary, is traditionally strong in the western UP region and draws its support from the Jat and Muslim farmers who dominate the region. Both parties oppose three central farm laws and have organised joint events. RLD said that its alliance talks with the SP were in the final stages. The two parties contested the 2017 assembly elections together, and all subsequent polls. “Yes, our alliance talks are in the final stages and soon the alliance will be announced,” said Anil Dubey, RLD national general secretary.On October 20, the SP announced an alliance with Om Prakash Rajbhar’s Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) and a few smaller parties, including the Mahan Dal. SBSP, which draws its strength from Backward Classescommunity in eastern UP, was an ally of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party but walked out in in May 2019, soon after the Lok Sabha polls complaining about ignoring the Backward Classes.But confusion reigned on Yadav’s possible candidature for the high-stakes polls.“So far as the matter of the SP national president contesting the 2022 UP assembly election himself is concerned, the Samajwadi Party will take the final decision and it will soon announce the decision. In the Samajwadi Party, the candidates’ selection process is already on. Akhilesh Yadav and the party are shortlisting all the ticket seekers. The scrutiny process is on,” said party state spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary.Yadav began his electoral career with a victory in the Lok Sabha bypoll in 2000 for the Kannauj seat, and was re-elected in 2004 and 2009.Even after becoming the Uttar Pradesh chief minister in 2012, Yadav did not contest an assembly bypoll. Instead, he entered the state legislature through the legislative council and vacated his Lok Sabha seat.

02-11-2021||India||India pledges new climate crisis goal: Net zero by 2070||India will reach carbon neutrality by 2070, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced as part of a five-point action plan that included reducing emissions to 50% by 2030, making the boldest pledge on Monday at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, where he also urged developed countries to deliver on their promise of climate financing.This is the first time India has committed to net-zero emissions, a target that is particularly hard for developing nations that need to balance commitment to economic growth. India, Modi said, was the only major economy that delivered its Paris Agreement commitments in “letter and spirit”.“By 2070, India will achieve the target of net-zero emissions,” the PM told more than 120 leaders at the critical talks. He added four more commitments: The country will increase its non-fossil fuel power capacity to 500 gigawatts (GW) by the end of the decade, up from 450GW; half of India’s energy will come from renewable sources by 2030; India’s 2030 carbon intensity goal — measured as carbon dioxide emissions per unit of gross domestic product — will be increased from 35% to 45%; and the country will also strive to produce half of its electricity using renewable energy and cut carbon-dioxide emissions 1 billion tons from business as usual by 2030. But Modi reiterated that rich countries have to ramp up their contributions to help less developed nations decarbonise. “It is India’s expectation that the world’s developed nations make $1 trillion available as climate finance as soon as possible,” Modi said. “Justice would demand that those nations that have not kept their climate commitments should be pressured... climate finance cannot lag climate action.”India has the lowest per capita emissions of the world’s major economies -- emitting 5% of the total, despite accounting for 17% of the world’s population. In absolute terms, India is the fourth largest carbon emitter after China and the US. China has pledged to turn carbon neutral by 2060 while the US and the European Union – as a block, EU nations together account for the third largest volume of emissions – aim to do so by 2050.India hasn’t submitted an updated nationally determined contribution (NDCs) with these commitments to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) yet.During his speech, Modi was particularly stern about the steps taken by developed countries. “All of us are aware of the reality that the promises made so far on climate finance have only proved to be hollow…world’s ambitions related to climate finance cannot be at the same level as they were during the Paris Agreement,” he said.“Today as we track the progress on climate mitigation in the same way we must also track climate finance. Justice will truly be served if the pressure ids put on those countries that have not lived up to their climate finance commitments. For many developing countries climate change threatens their very existence. We will have to take big steps as it’s the need of hour,” he added.Senior officials said India’s actions will depend on climate finance, which will be made available by developed countries. “We have a long fight in the next two weeks over climate finance and it will be critical in determining whether India puts this in NDCs. It will be the biggest point of negotiation for us,” said a member of the Indian delegation who is in Glasgow, who asked not to be named.Bhupender Yadav, Union environment minister, said: “As a leader, PM has upheld the views and imperatives of all developing countries. He has underlined that climate finance and transfer of new technology will be critical for transition”.Energy experts and environmentalists welcomed India’s submission, saying that it balances India’s development needs and also demands more action, especially on finance from historical emitters.“India has walked the talk on its commitments and has now significantly upped these. The developed world must meet its commitments on finance and technology now. Good that imperatives of our development were also underscored while adding to our commitments,” said Manjeev Singh Puri, former ambassador, climate negotiator and distinguished fellow at The Energy and Resources Institute.Experts also said Modi’s announcement is a win because it’s consistent with what scientists agree is needed to meet that target. To keep temperatures from rising more than 1.5C, the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projects that the world has to reach net-zero carbon dioxide emissions by about mid-century and then hit net zero across all greenhouse gases by 2070.“India’s pledges are significantly more ambitious than its current NDC,” said Ulka Kelkar of the World Resources Institute India, referring to the NDCs under the Paris accord. “These will take the country on a low-carbon development pathway and give strong signals to every sector of industry and society.”Many developing countries in Asia have announced net zero targets - like Thailand, Sri Lanka, Malayasia. “The experience of many European economies over the last 30 years shows that it is possible to achieve sustained economic growth while significantly cutting emissions, even after accounting for consumption and imports. For India also, strong climate action will help reduce air pollution and create new jobs,” added Kelkar.A former senior climate negotiator from India said the country “was under immense pressure to commit to a net zero target from US and other developed nations”. “We all know it. But now, 2070 is out there and India has indicated a direction. It will be pushed to include this in its NDCs and will be subjected to review as per the provisions under Paris Agreement. At the same time India could not have been reluctant on a global stage when many countries are announcing net zero targets. So India will have to take this commitment seriously and plan it out. It cannot be conditional to finance alone,” said this person, who asked not to be named.“This was a very significant moment for the summit, with Prime Minister Modi pledging stronger action by India on climate change, with five new targets...This demonstrates real leadership, based on a track record of action and ambitious targets, that can deliver on both economic development and climate change, from a country whose emissions per capita are about one-third of the global average. The rich world must respond to Prime Minister Modi’s challenge to deliver a strong increase in international climate finance,” Lord Stern of Brentford, chair of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science said.Several world leaders spoke till the time of going to press, each ramping up an end-of-the-world rhetoric. For UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, global warming was “a doomsday device” strapped to humanity. United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said people are “digging our own graves” and Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley, speaking for vulnerable island nations, warned leaders not to “allow the path of greed and selfishness to sow the seeds of our common destruction.”“There’s no more time to sit back,” Biden said in a more measured warning that also apologised for his predecessor’s temporarily pulling the US out of the historic 2015 Paris agreement, something he said put the country behind in its efforts.Earlier in the day, PM Modi, speaking at the Leaders Event on Action and Solidarity, said India is extremely vulnerable to climate change. “Adaptation hasn’t got as much attention as mitigation to climate change. This is not justified, especially for countries bearing the brunt of climate change,” he said.Cropping patterns in India are changing due to monsoonal flooding and unseasonal and extreme rainfall. India’s infrastructure needs to be made resilient to climate change and climate change adaptation should be mainstreamed he said.At his address at COP26, the PM began with recounting India’s recent efforts on climate change. “We are making all possible efforts in a resolute manner and working hard. In terms of installed renewable energy capacity, India is ranked fourth; it has increased its non-fossil fuel energy by 25% over the last seven years; and it now represents 40% of our energy mix,” he said.Net zero refers to a balance where emissions of greenhouse gases that raise the planet’s temperature continue are offset by the absorption of an equivalent amount from the atmosphere. Experts see net zero targets as a critical measure to successfully tackle climate change and its devastating consequences.(With Bloomberg inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-pledges-new-climate-crisis-goal-net-zero-by-2070-101635793110247.html
02-11-2021||India||Ahead of UP polls, SP chief Akhilesh's Jinnah remark triggers political row||Samajwadi Party national president Akhilesh Yadav’s reference to Muhammad Ali Jinnah in the same breath as some of the stalwarts of India’s freedom struggle has has snowballed into a controversy, with UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath leading the charge against the SP chief.Adityanath at a public meeting in Moradabad on Monday said the comment smacked of “Talibani mentality, which the people of the country and Uttar Pradesh will not tolerate”.He was responding to Yadav’s comment, at a public meeting in Hardoi on Sunday that “Sardar Patel, mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, and Mohammed Ali Jinnah studied in the same institute and became barristers. They helped (India) get freedom and never backed away from any struggle.”The speech came on the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhai Patel, independent India’s first home minister and the man who united the country by convincing the princely states to merge with the Union of India. Unlike the other three who studied law at the Inner Temple, Patel studied at the Middle Temple.In response, Adityanath said on Moradabad: “I heard the statement of Samajwadi Party president. He compared ‘desh-todo’ (one responsible for dividing the country) Jinnah with ‘desh-jodo’ (the one who united the country) Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. The statement is downright shameful. Sardar Patel is the architect of the country’s unity. At present, work is on to realise the dream of ‘Ek Bharat, Shreshth Bharat’ of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. But his (Akhilesh’s) ‘vibhajankaari’ (divisive) mentality has surfaced once again when he compared Sardar Patel to Jinnah. He tried to glorify Jinnah”.Elections in Uttar Pradesh, India’s most politically important state are due early next year and all parties, including the BJP and the SP have launched their campaigns.Adityanath continued his criticism of Yadav in another meeting on Monday in Haryana’s Faridabad.“Earlier Jinnah supporters fired upon Ram Bhakts; if they come again, they will again do it. Now (during BJP rule) bullets are fired upon terrorists, traitors.”His reference was to the firing on karsewaks in Ayodhya in 1990, during the Ram Janmabhoomi movement, when the Samajwadi Party was in power in the state.With the movement coming to a fruition in 2019 with a Supreme Court verdict allowing the construction of a Ram temple at Ram Janmabhoomi, work on which is currently underway, the BJP has made it (the temple and the movement) one of the pillars of its campaign.On Saturday, in another public meeting, Adityanath asked: “Will those responsible for ordering firing would apologise to the nation?”The Samajwadi Party sought to defend Yadav’s remarks. “Its spokesperson and MLC Udaiveer Singh said: “Akhilesh did not say anything wrong. In the statement, he drew a parallel between Jinnah and the RSS as both were responsible for the country’s partition. Akhilesh only mentioned facts that Gandhi, Nehru, Patel, and Jinnah studied at the same institute and worked for the country’s freedom. This is true. And he meant that while Patel was responsible for India’s unity, he banned RSS as it were the RSS and Jinnah (who were) responsible for dividing the country.”Jinnah is a polarising figure in India where he is held responsible for pushing for the partition and the creation of Pakistan, as well of the horrors that followed the split. In 2018, several BJP leaders from Uttar Pradesh demanded the removal of Jinnah’s portrait from the office of the students union of Aligarh Muslim University.Political analyst and former head of the department of political science, Lucknow University, Professor SK Dwivedi said Yadav’s comment seemed “calculated”.“One day he says he will build a better temple (than the one coming up at Ram Janmabhoomi in Ayodhya) and then the next day he invokes Jinnah. Akhilesh’s comment seems aimed at appeasing minorities ahead of the 2022 polls.”The Bahujan Samaj Party, however, said there is “collusion” between the SP and the BJP. In a tweet in Hindi, BSP chief Mayawati alleged that Yadav’s remarks on Jinnah and the BJP’s response to it were part of a well-thought-out strategy of the two parties to vitiate the atmosphere on Hindu-Muslim lines ahead of the Uttar Pradesh assembly polls.Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) national president Jayant Chaudhary, in a tweet, said: “Jinnah, Indo-Pak Cricket, Aurangzeb doesn’t matter...The economy, job creation, governance must win!”. In the tweet, Jayant attached the RLD manifesto’s page and added: “Let’s take up the issues and ignite a debate on development models, policies & programmes!” The RLD has been SP’s ally since 2017 UP assembly polls and the two parties are set to continue the alliance for the 2022 polls as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-up-elections-sp-chief-akhislesh-yadav-jinnah-remark-triggers-political-row-101635793051072.html
02-11-2021||India||PM Narendra Modi holds bilateral talks with British counterpart Boris Johnson||Glasgow, Nov 1 (PTI) Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday met his British counterpart Boris Johnson on the sidelines of the COP26 climate summit here and the two leaders discussed cooperation in areas like green hydrogen, renewables and clean technology, economy and defence.This was the first in-person meeting between Modi and Johnson following the British Prime Minister’s twice cancelled visit to India earlier this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.The interaction, soon after the opening ceremony of the World Leaders’ Summit at COP26, was scheduled to focus on the UK-India climate partnership as well as a review of the 2030 Roadmap for stronger UK-India strategic ties – signed by the two leaders during a virtual summit in May this year.“Marching ahead on Roadmap 2030. PM @narendramodi met UK PM @BorisJohnson in Glasgow today. Congratulated him for successfully organising @COP26. Discussed cooperation in areas like green hydrogen, renewables & clean tech. Also exchanged views on economy, defence, P2P ties,” Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Arindam Bagchi tweeted soon after the meeting.According to official sources, the relatively short interaction focussed on exchanging views and taking stock of the bilateral relationship. The issue of security and counter-terrorism, with a likely focus on separatist Khalistani activities in the UK, are likely to have featured during the discussions.Prime Minister Modi is expected to have reiterated his invitation for Johnson to visit India.“Both governments remain committed to the implementation of the Roadmap, within prescribed timelines. Accordingly, we are looking to launch negotiations in November 2021 for an Interim Agreement to be signed in March 2022 and eventually a comprehensive agreement, if all goes according to schedule, by November 2022,” India’s High Commissioner to the UK, Gaitri Issar Kumar, said ahead of the prime ministerial talks.The Modi-Johnson meet, dubbed an important bilateral of the UK leg of Modi’s European tour, was followed by a leader-level COP26 event entitled Action and Solidarity: The Critical Decade, for which the UK had extended a special invitation for Modi to deliver an address on the subject of “adaptation”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-narendra-modi-holds-bilateral-talks-with-british-counterpart-boris-johnson-101635792937786.html
02-11-2021||India||Congress, BJP push for Odisha minister’s sacking, say new evidence indicts him||BHUBANESWAR: Odisha’s opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress on Monday escalated their attacks on the ruling Biju Janata Dal (BJD) government’s minister of state for home Dibya Shankar Mishra, claiming that the minister was not only close to the man accused of murdering a school teacher in Kalahandi but also attempted to mediate between the teacher and the prime accused, Gobind Sahu.Gobind Sahu, president of the managing committee of Sunshine English medium school, a private school in Mahaling panchayat of Kalahandi district, is alleged to have strangled 26-year-old school teacher Mamita Meher, in his car on October 8 after she threatened to expose his affairs. According to the police, he cut her body into pieces, burnt it and buried it in an under-construction stadium near the school. He was arrested on October 19 and was sent to jail after he was questioned for five days.Since then, the opposition has been demanding the minister’s sacking from the Naveen Patnaik ministry due to his proximity with Gobind Sahu, a demand that was rejected by BJD leaders who insisted that Dibya Shankar Mishra could not be penalised for the actions of someone he knew.On Monday, the BJP and Congress stepped up their attacks.Congress MLA from Kantabanji Santosh Singh Saluja alleged Dibya Shankar Mishra, Gobind Sahu and school teacher Mamita Meher were present at the Mishra’s residence in Chhattisgarh capital Raipur between September 20 and 23.“Mishra tried to iron out differences between Sahu and Mamita at his Kool Homes apartment in Raipur. Sahu then deposited money in Mamita’s SBI account on October 7 a day before she was killed,” said Saluja.Soon after, BJP leader Bijoy Mohapatra claimed that there were three meetings between Sahu and Meher in Raipur, not just once as alleged by Saluja.“Not once, the meeting between accused Gobind Sahu and Mamita was held thrice in Raipur. Govind Sahu was in touch with Mishra and even held a telephonic conversation with him when he was detained in the police barrack of Titilagarh town from where he escaped subsequently. This is just the first few pages of the story. There will not be a full stop to the case anytime soon and more explosive facts are going to surface in coming days,” said. Mohapatra.Mishra, Odisha’s energy minister who also holds charge as minister of state for home, did not respond to phone calls and text messages seeking his comments on the fresh allegations levelled by Saluja and Mohapatra.Congress leader Narasingha Mishra also alleged that Mishra tried to mediate a dispute between Meher and Sahu after the former threatened to expose him, Odisha Congress president Niranjan Patnaik questioned the Raipur visit by the trio. “What did they discuss in Raipur? Why did minister Dibya Shankar spend nights in Sunshine school,” he asked.The allegations came on the day the Bolangir police seized the JCB machine and the two-wheeler allegedly used by accused Gobinda Sahu to bury Mamita Meher’s body. Both vehicles were seized from Mahaling in the Kalahandi district. Police alleged that Sahu admitted that he used the JCB to bury her the burnt body parts in a 10-feet deep pit that was dug before he killed her. The two-wheeler was allegedly used to ferry tyres used to burn the body.Meanwhile, BJD leader and editor of Odia daily Sambad, Soumya Ranjan Patnaik continued to embarrass the BJD leadership in another front-page editorial in which he appeared to keep the pressure on his party.“Even as the minister said that the opposition and certain media houses are running a smear campaign against him as they have an axe to grind, what he seems to have forgotten is an independent inquiry in the murder case will not be possible unless he put down his papers,” wrote Patnaik, asserting that he would bat for the state’s interests rather than his party.Patnaik recalled that in 2016 when more than 20 people died in the infamous SUM hospital fire, then health minister Atanu Sabyasachi Nayak resigned on moral grounds to maintain high standards of public propriety. “He resigned to preserve the image of the party and the government, though he had no role whatsoever in the mishap,” said Soumya Ranjan Patnaik, a ruling BJD legislator.“Everyone knows what happened during the JB Patnaik’s rule two decades ago when the government dithered over taking action against the then advocate general Indrajit Ray following allegations over his links in the infamous Anjana Mishra molestation case,” wrote Patnaik, who is also the son-in-law of JB Patnaik who was forced to step down and replaced with Giridhar Gamang in February 1999.Taking a swipe at Mishra for invoking Goddess Samaleswari, the presiding deity at Kalahandi most-revered temple, Patnaik said while a common man takes refuge in God whenever he feels helpless, it is perplexing what made the minister helpless.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-bjp-push-for-odisha-minister-s-sacking-say-new-evidence-indicts-him-101635792931919.html
02-11-2021||India||Dabur ad taken down due to intolerance, says justice Chandrachud||Supreme Court judge DY Chandrachud on Monday said that the ‘Karva Chauth’ advertisement featuring a same-sex couple was withdrawn by Dabur due to “public intolerance,” adding that there is a need to change the mindset of both men and women.Speaking at a virtual conference conducted jointly by the National Legal Services Authority and National Commission for Women on Saturday, Justice Chandrachud said, “There is a great divergence between ideals of the law and the state of society today” while speaking on the topic, “Empowerment of Women through Legal Awareness.” “Just two days ago, all of you would know of this advertisement which a company was required to pull down. It was an advertisement for Karva Chauth of a same sex couple. It had to be withdrawn on the ground of public intolerance,” he said.He was referring to the advertisement issued by Dabur’s Fem Crème bleach showing a lesbian couple celebrating Karva Chauth. After public outrage against the advertisement on the social media, the company took down the advertisement and tendered an unconditional apology for hurting public sentiments.“Every day in our lives, as judges in the Supreme Court, you come across injustice against women, daughter in law being thrown out of house and when she complains, she is told that her husband has no title in the joint family home. When maintenance is sought to be enforced, she is told that the business is of the joint family and husband is only a salaried partner in the business.”Justice Chandrachud said that we have provided laws such as the Domestic Violence Act and the Prevention of Sexual Harassment at Workplace Act to achieve the aim of fulfilling the constitutional rights of women but women are daily being deprived of their rights as there is a need to make our society and workplaces inclusive. He referred to the recent attempts by the Supreme Court to provide access of equal rights to women in the armed forces.“I believe that the deprivation of rights of women, if we have to find an answer to them, the origin must be in the changing of mindset, both men and women… Legal awareness of rights of women is not merely a women’s issue. That awareness can be truly meaningful if it is created among the younger generation of men in our society,” the Supreme Court judge said.The event held at Varanasi which marked the launch of nationwide legal awareness programme on the subject of Women Empowerment was presided over by Justice UU Lalit of the Supreme Court, who is also the Executive Chairman of NALSA.Justice Chandrachud was of the view that women share multiple identities and this is not recognized by the society which is marked by a sexual division between men and women. He proposed an intersectional approach to end the violence and discrimination against women and warned that entitlements given to women under various laws should not become a ruse or an excuse for perpetuating domination of men.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dabur-ad-taken-down-due-to-intolerance-says-justice-chandrachud-101635792870261.html
02-11-2021||India||A month after launch, BH series registrations yet to gather pace||Only about 137 vehicles in India have been registered with the latest “Bharat” (BH) series ever since the Union government launched the new registration series on September 15, national data seen by HT showed.The BH series was introduced by the ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) to allow people with transferable jobs to continue using their existing four-wheeler or two-wheeler in another state after relocation. At present, people who relocate to another state have to first get a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the state where their vehicle is registered. Once the NOC is issued from the parent state, the vehicle is to be re-registered in the new state within 12 months. Besides, even the road tax that was paid for 15 years while purchasing the vehicle has to be re-paid in the new state where the vehicle owner has relocated and the process of getting a refund on pro-rata basis becomes too tedious.The Bharat series was introduced to simplify all these hassles with an online application process where vehicles with the BH registration number are not required to be re-registered in a new state. Also, instead of the owner paying the road tax upfront for 15 years in total, the tax is levied for two years and in multiple of two thereafter.However, ministry data accessed by HT showed that the new BH series has seen a slow start with only eight of the 36 states and UTs in India implementing it so far. Among the states that have implemented the BH series, Odisha registered 63 vehicles - the highest of all. This was followed by Delhi (39), and Goa and Rajasthan with 12 registrations each. The other states/UTs include Chandigarh (5), Himachal Pradesh (3), Maharashtra (2) and Andaman and Nicobar Islands (1). All figures are till October 29.“We have sent reminders to all the states and UTs, but only a handful of them have actually introduced the series in the past one and a half months. This is one major reason for the slow start. Besides, a few states have also put up queries to the MoRTH seeking clarifications. For example, road tax is a state subject and some states have questioned the proportion in which they should charge for two years instead of 15 years. We are resolving these teething issues to make it more seamless,” said a senior ministry official on condition of anonymity.For a BH registered vehicle, the Centre has prescribed that the road tax be charged at 8% if the cost of the vehicle is below ₹10 lakh; 10% for those costing between ₹10 and ₹20 lakh; and 12% for vehicles costing over ₹20 lakh. Diesel vehicles are to be charged 2% extra, while electric vehicles shall be charged 2% less tax.A second senior officer said a few other states also questioned as to how they would verify if the vehicle owner is actually eligible for BH registration. “As per the rule, those who are in transferable jobs such as government employees or even private sector employees whose companies are present in at least four states/UTs are eligible for a BH series registration. While it is easier to verify government employees, some states said they have no way of checking whether a private company has offices in four or more states or not,” said the officer on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-month-after-launch-bh-series-registrations-yet-to-gather-pace-101635792814174.html
02-11-2021||India||Leaders dial up doomsday warning to kick-start COP26 climate talks||GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) — World leaders turned up the heat and resorted to end-of-the-world rhetoric on Monday in an attempt to bring new urgency to sputtering international climate negotiations.The metaphors were dramatic and mixed at the start of the talks, known as COP26. For British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, global warming was “a doomsday device” strapped to humanity. United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres told his colleagues that people are “digging our own graves.” And Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley, speaking for vulnerable island nations, added moral thunder, warning leaders not to “allow the path of greed and selfishness to sow the seeds of our common destruction.”After apocalyptic warnings from those three and a few others, a handful of more sedate — sometimes detailed — speeches followed. U.S. President Joe Biden and German Chancellor Angela Merkel avoided soaring rhetoric and delved into wonky policy.“There’s no more time to sit back,” Biden said in a more measured warning that also apologized for his predecessor’s temporarily pulling the U.S. out of the historic 2015 Paris agreement, something he said put the country behind in its efforts. “Every day we delay, the cost of inaction increases.”In addition to coaxing big carbon-polluting nations to promise more stringent emission cuts, French President Emmanuel Macron said European nations now have to shift from promises to action.Earlier, Johnson — who is hosting the summit in the Scottish city of Glasgow — likened an ever-warming Earth’s position to that of fictional secret agent James Bond: strapped to a bomb that will destroy the planet and trying to defuse it.He told leaders that the only difference now is that the “ticking doomsday device” is not fiction and “it’s one minute to midnight on that doomsday clock.” The threat now is climate change, triggered by the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, and he noted that it all started in Glasgow with James Watt’s steam engine powered by coal.Johnson also pointed out that the more than 130 world leaders gathered for the leaders’ summit portion of the U.N. climate conference had an average age of over 60, while the generations most harmed by climate change aren’t yet born.The conference aims to get governments to commit to curbing carbon emissions fast enough to keep global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels. The world has already warmed 1.1 degrees Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit). Current projections based on planned emissions cuts over the next decade are for it to hit 2.7C (4.9F) by the year 2100.Increased warming over coming decades would melt much of the planet’s ice, raise global sea levels and greatly increase the likelihood and intensity of extreme weather, scientists say. With every tenth of a degree of warming, the dangers soar faster, they say.The other goals for the meeting are for rich nations to give poor nations $100 billion a year in climate aid and to reach an agreement to spend half of the money to adapt to worsening climate impacts.But Mottley, of Barbados, warned negotiators are falling short.“This is immoral and it is unjust,” Mottley said. “Are we so blinded and hardened that we can no longer appreciate the cries of humanity?”“We are already gasping for survival,” chimed in President Wavel John Charles Ramkalawan of the Seychelles, another island nation. “Tomorrow is not an option for it will be too late.”Guterres struck an equally gloomy note.“We are digging our own graves,” said the U.N. secretary-general. “Our planet is changing before our eyes — from the ocean depths to mountaintops, from melting glaciers to relentless extreme weather events.”The speeches will continue through Tuesday, then the leaders will leave.The idea is that they will do the big political give-and-take, setting out broad outlines of agreement, and then have other government officials hammer out the nagging but crucial details. That’s what worked to make the historic 2015 Paris climate deal a success, former U.N. Climate Secretary Christiana Figueres told The Associated Press.“For heads of state, it is actually a much better use of their strategic thinking,” Figueres said.In Paris, the two signature goals — the 1.5-degree Celsius limit and net zero carbon emissions by 2050 — were created by this leaders-first process, Figueres said. In the unsuccessful 2009 Copenhagen meeting the leaders swooped in at the end.Thousands lined up in a chilly wind in Glasgow on Monday to get through a bottleneck at the entrance to the venue. But what will be noticeable are a handful of major absences.Xi Jinping, president of top carbon-polluting nation China, won’t be in Glasgow. Figueres said his absence isn’t that big a deal because he isn’t leaving the country during the pandemic and his climate envoy is a veteran negotiator.Biden, however, has chided China and Russia for their less than ambitious efforts to curb emissions and blamed them for a disappointing statement on climate change at the end of the meeting of leaders from the Group of 20 major economies in Rome this weekend.Perhaps more troublesome for the U.N. summit is the absence of several small nations from the Pacific islands that couldn’t make it because of COVID-19 restrictions and logistics. That’s a big problem because their voices relay urgency, Figueres said.In addition, the heads of several major emerging economies beyond China are also skipping Scotland, including those from Russia, Turkey, Mexico, Brazil and South Africa. That leaves India’s Narendra Modi the only leader present from the so-called BRICS nations, which account for more than 40% of global emissions.Kevin Conrad, a negotiator from Papua New Guinea who also chairs the Coalition for Rainforest Nations, said he’s watching the big carbon-polluting nations. “I think it’s really important for the United States and China to show leadership as the two largest emitters. If both of them can show it can be done, I think they give hope to the rest of the world,” he said.But before the U.N. climate summit, the G-20 leaders offered vague climate pledges instead of commitments of firm action, saying they would seek carbon neutrality “by or around mid-century.” The countries also agreed to end public financing for coal-fired power generation abroad, but set no target for phasing out coal domestically — a clear nod to China and India.The G-20 countries represent more than three-quarters of the world’s climate-damaging emissions and summit host Italy, and Britain had been hoping for more ambitious targets.India, the world’s third-biggest emitter, has yet to follow China, the U.S. and the European Union in setting a target for reaching “net zero” emissions. Negotiators are hoping Modi will announce such a goal in Glasgow.But the Biden administration has tried hard to temper expectations.Rather than a quick fix, “Glasgow is the beginning of this decade race, if you will,” Biden’s climate envoy, John Kerry, told reporters Sunday.___This story has been updated to correct that the goal is to keep global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, not below.___Associated Press writers Jill Lawless, Frank Jordans and Ellen Knickmeyer contributed to this report.

Each investor was duped of ₹62,100 in the name of providing bike taxis. He was arrested following his surrender in Uttar Pradesh’s Surajpur court in June 2019 and is in prison since then.The scam surfaced after a complainant Sunil Kumar Meena, a resident of Jaipur, filed an FIR against the Bike Bot operator at Dadri police station in Uttar Pradesh on February 14, 2019 against Sanjay Bhati and five directors of the company.In its FIR, CBI has taken cognisance of the Uttar Pradesh government letter, which had referred 11 FIRs of the Noida Police registered at Dadri for the central agency probe in December 2019.“Under a preplanned conspiracy the respondent Sanjay Bhati and his associates have cheated and defrauded investors and have collected at least 15 thousands crores of money across the country in the name of business of ‘BIKE BOT - THE BIKE TAXI POWERED BY GIPL’ and misappropriated the same,” the FIR stated.CBI FIR, without naming the officers, said that “complaints were submitted and fraudulent activity of the company was in the knowledge of the Noida district authority’s as well as police authorities who did not take any action, rather Senior Superintendent of Police and Superintendent of Police Crime branch pressurized the complainants to withdraw their complaints”.Bhati is lodged in prison. HT could not locate his legal representatives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-to-investigate-uttar-pradesh-bike-bot-ponzi-scheme-101635792450364.html
02-11-2021||India||CBI probe on Navy leak case: Info on 3 other projects may have been leaked||The navy leak case may be bigger than what last week’s release on an investigation into the leak of information regarding the upgrade of submarines suggested, people familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity.Central Bureau of Investigation’s (CBI) probe into the Naval leak case, in which a serving Commander was arrested, has revealed that “peripheral” information on at least three other projects of the Indian Navy was leaked over the past year, they added.More people, including some navy officers, both serving and retired, and some other people are likely to be arrested in coming days, the people said.The investigation agency arrested five people, including a Commander-rank serving officer, two retired navy personnel and two others in September for allegedly leaking confidential information related to the upgrade of Russian-origin Kilo class submarines. It is alleged that the Commander shared crucial details about the ongoing modernisation project of Kilo class submarines with the two retired officers in return for money. The information about the case was made public last week.Sharing details of investigation, which is being monitored at the highest level, a senior officer said it is likely that two or three groups were involved in leaking information in lieu of bribes, and that this was going on for at least a year.The people involved, “had access to only peripheral information regarding these projects,” said a second officer. “Highly classified data was luckily not compromised.”“We are trying to ascertain if all these groups involved were connected with each other and if the payments were made at the behest of some anti-India elements,” added this person.Both officers refused to divulge the details of the other projects whose information may have been leaked.The agency may not register separate First Information Reports (FIRs) but rather file separate charge sheets against the suspects in the existing case, the officers said.The Indian Navy said on October 26 that an investigation related to the alleged leak of information of an administrative and commercial nature had come to light and was being investigated by the appropriate government agency.The navy is also conducting an internal inquiry in the matter, which is being led by a vice admiral to find out how the information leaked despite security protocols and advisories, and how lacunae, if any can be fixed.India operates eight Kilo class submarines, four HDW German origin submarines and three Scorpene submarines built in India under technology transfer from France (three more Scorpenes will join the fleet in the future). The navy also operates an indigenous nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine, INS Arihant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-probe-on-navy-leak-case-information-on-3-other-projects-may-have-been-leaked-101635792089532.html
02-11-2021||India||Army conducts high-altitude airborne exercise in eastern Ladakh||The Indian Army on Monday launched airborne drills in eastern Ladakh to validate and showcase its rapid response capabilities in high altitudes even as India and China are locked in a standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the sensitive sector.The exercise includes inter-theatre movement of troops and equipment, precision stand-off drops, rapid grouping and ability to capture designated targets with speed and surprise, officials familiar with the development said on condition of anonymity.An airborne brigade, called Shatrujeet, comprising the army’s finest paratroopers is the centrepiece of the three-day high-altitude combat manoeuvres that saw soldiers being inserted into a drop zone at an altitude of more than 14,000 feet on the opening day, said one of the officials cited above.“Acclimatised troops along with specialist vehicles and missile detachments were transported (to the exercise area) via US-origin C-130J special operations aircraft and Soviet-origin AN-32 medium transport planes from five different mounting bases to validate inter-theatre move, precision drops and capture of designated objectives,” said a second official, adding the drop was particularly challenging as it took place in minus 20-degree conditions.Experts said the timing of the exercise was significant as it was being staged three weeks after the 13th round of military talks between India and China to cool tensions in Ladakh reached an impasse on October 10, with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) not agreeing to suggestions made by the Indian Army.Other elements of the exercise include integrated battle drills by airborne forces, mechanised columns and attack helicopters, the second official said,The Indian Army is clearly demonstrating its combat capabilities to China with the high-altitude exercise, said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General BS Jaswal (retd).“India stood up to China after the border row erupted, and now the army is sending a message that PLA should not underestimate Indian military capabilities. Such drills have been conducted in the past but on a smaller scale,” Jaswal added.The high-intensity manoeuvres also come in the backdrop of PLA scaling up its military activities in the east. It has intensified patrolling in sensitive areas across LAC in Arunachal Pradesh after the lingering standoff with India began last year in the Ladakh sector.PLA has also ramped up area domination patrols for surveillance and orientation of newly inducted troops with a noticeable increase in visits by senior PLA officers to forward areas to supervise the military activities in the eastern sector, as previously reported by HT.The sectors across which the Indian Army has detected increased PLA activity in Arunachal Pradesh include Lungro La, Zimithang and Bum La -- areas of high historical significance in the context of Chinese aggression in the eastern sector -- and counter measures have been taken to boost India’s readiness to handle any contingency.The October 10 military dialogue in Ladakh took place more than two months after the last round of talks that led to disengagement of forward deployed troops from Gogra, or Patrolling Point-17A, in early August.Despite two rounds of disengagement at friction points this year, the two armies still have 50,000 to 60,000 troops each deployed in Ladakh. Outstanding problems at Hot Springs and Depsang are yet to be resolved.The Indian Army’s patrolling activity has been affected in Hot Springs (PP-15) and PLA’s forward presence in Depsang has also hindered access of Indian soldiers to routes including the ones leading to PP-10, 11, 11-A, 12 and 13.There is no end in sight to the standoff, with army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane stating on October 9 that if PLA is there to stay in the Ladakh theatre so is the Indian Army.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-conducts-high-altitude-airborne-exercise-in-eastern-ladakh-101635791793960.html
02-11-2021||India||IT panel seeks LS Speaker’s permission to call Facebook whistleblowers||The Parliamentary standing committee on information technology has sought permission from Speaker Om Birla to have Facebook whistleblowers depose before it as allegations of the company using algorithms, that allowed the amplification of hate speech in India, lands it in controversy, panel chairperson Shashi Tharoor said on Monday. “The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information Technology did not exist between September 12 & October 12 when it was officially reconstituted. It had to then adopt its agenda, submit it to the Speaker &have it bulletinized before it could convene any meetings,” the Congress MP wrote on Twitter. “This has just happened & with its agenda official, the Committee will hold its first meetings of the new session on Nov16&17. Under our procedures videoconferencing is not permitted. Testimony in person by witnesses from abroad requires the Speaker’s consent. This is being sought,” he added. Last month, whistleblower Frances Haugen sent a complaint to the US Securities and Exchange Commission citing internal documents that back some of these allegations. Haugen has already testified before the US Senate and the UK Parliament. India will be the third country where she will testify if permission is granted. Another former Facebook employee, Sophie Zhang, earlier exposed the company’s partisan policy in removing inauthentic accounts from the social media platform ahead of the 2020 Delhi elections. Zhang is among several former Facebook employees and contractors who have said that the company’s policies and management are leading to harm. In a tweet last month, she had also said she would be willing to testify before the Indian Parliament. The disclosed documents also mention that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh linked users, groups and pages promote islamophobia and “fear-mongering”, but the company failed to put “forth a nomination or designation” for the group given the “political sensitiveness”. This, however, is not the first time when Facebook has been accused of not censoring BJP-related political content. Last year, the social media firm’s public policy head Ankhi Das had to step down over allegations that Facebook refused to action “hate-speech” by a BJP politician. The panel then summoned Facebook India officials to explain their stance regarding the allegations of adopting a biased approach. The panel has also heard from several other social media platforms as its agenda include the safety and security of users on the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-panel-may-call-facebook-whistleblowers-101635790890823.html

Randhawa said such people should also be beaten.The video was first shared on Twitter by Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) leader Naeem Akhtar, to which party president Mehbooba Mufti responded stating “no action” had been taken against the BJP leader.“No action taken against an ex-BJP MLA who calls for genocide of Kashmir and to skin them alive. But J&K students are charged with sedition for merely cheering the winning team. India is surely the mother of all democracies,” Mufti tweeted.No action taken against an ex BJP MLA who calls for genocide of Kashmiris & to skin them alive.

This is unacceptable to the party and has brought disrepute and embarrassment to the party,” PTI reported, quoting the notice.Also Read | 'Patriotism can't be forced': Mehbooba Mufti urges PM Modi to intervene in arrests of Kashmiri studentsThe BJP disciplinary committee has asked Randhawa to render an explanation over his remarks within the next 48 hours.Raina also warned Randhawa of strict action if an apology did not come soon. The BJP chief further clarified that Randhawa’s statements had “nothing to do” with the saffron party’s stand.Meanwhile, Randhawa’s statements have triggered protests in the Valley, with senior lawyer Sheikh Shakeel urging the inspector general of police to book the BJP leader.Shakeel said Randhawa had in the past openly threatened a government official and also used derogatory remarks against Union minister Jitendra Singh. “We appeal to the IGP to…book him immediately for hurting the sentiments of the Muslims,” the lawyer was quoted as saying by PTI.As many as three Kashmiri engineering students were sent to 14-day judicial custody on Friday for their alleged “anti-national” slogans and praise of Pakistan during the country’s match against India in the T20 World Cup event last week.A complaint against the students of RBS Engineering College in Uttar Pradesh’s Agra district was initially filed by Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) leader Gaurav Rajawat.Later, a statement released from Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s official Twitter handle said individuals celebrating Pakistan’s win will “face sedition”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jk-bjp-serves-show-cause-notice-to-party-leader-over-hateful-comments-101635789863534.html
02-11-2021||India||Oct GST revenue hits new high at ₹1.3L-cr||Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenue in October surged to ₹1.3 lakh crore, the second highest since the new tax was launched in July 2017, signalling a robust recovery of business activities after the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, and increased compliance.Collections of the indirect tax, widely seen as a weathervane of economic activity, have exceeded ₹1 lakh crore for the fourth month in a row, after they plunged below the benchmark in June due to the devastating second wave of Covid-19.The number is the latest of several indicators that highlight a recovery in the economy. Data released on Monday showed the Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for manufacturing for the month of October at 55.9, the highest since February. And according to the Controller General of Accounts (CGA), which works under the ministry of finance, there has been an increase in direct tax revenue as well as central government spending in the month of SeptemberGross GST revenue in October this year is ₹1,30,127 crore, a 24% year-on-year jump and a 36% increase over October 2019, according to data from the finance ministry. The highest ever GST collection of ₹1,41,384 crore was also reported this year -- in April ahead of the second wave of Covid-19, which resulted in lockdowns in many states across the country and lasted wholly or in part, through May. Commenting on high GST revenue collection, the finance ministry said in a statement: “This is very much in line with the trend in economic recovery. This is also evident from the trend in the e-way bills generated every month since the second wave. The revenues would have still been higher if the sale of cars and other products had not been affected on account of disruption in the supply of semiconductors.”E-way bills are an indication of volume of interstate movement of goods. “The revenues have also been aided due to the efforts of the state and central tax administration resulting in increased compliance over previous months. In addition to action against individual tax evaders, this has been a result of the multipronged approach followed by the GST Council,” the finance ministry added.MS Mani, senior director at consulting firm Deloitte India said the high GST revenue in October is a result of continuing policy initiatives to improve compliance and discourage evasion. The GST collection in October 2017 was ₹93,333 crore, in October 2018, ₹1,00,710 crore, in October 2019, ₹95,379 crore, and in October 2020, ₹1,05,155 crore.The government recently introduced several measures to ease compliance such as nil-filing through SMS, quarterly return monthly payment (QRMP) system, and auto-population of return. The government allows GST registered taxpayers to file nil returns through an easy process of SMS if they do not have any business activity in a specific period to check deliberate tax evasion. While, QRMP saves small taxpayers from paperworks by allowing them to pay tax every month but file returns quarterly, auto-population of returns pre-filled details of invoices making tax evasion difficult.In the past year, the GST Council took various steps to discourage non-compliant behaviour such as blocking of E-way bills for non-filing of returns, system-based suspension of registration of taxpayers who failed to file six returns in a row, and blocking of credit for return defaulters.Mani said: “In addition to various measures to streamline return filings, e-way bill generation etc, several restrictions placed on non-compliant taxpayers would also have resulted in many taxpayers gradually becoming more compliant and paying GST and filing returns promptly. Going forward, we may see more checks and balances being introduced to encourage filers and dissuade non-filers.”Experts expect that the trend of strong revenue collection to be sustained. Abhishek Jain, tax partner at consultancy firm EY India, said: “The robust GST collections are quite encouraging and a clear sign of economic recovery. With the ongoing festive season, we can expect similar or even higher GST collections in the coming months.”October’s GST revenue correspond to transactions in September. Experts say that expected reforms such as tax rate rationalisation and correction in inverted duty structure will push tax revenue further.At the 45th meeting of the GST Council on September 17, the apex decision-making body on indirect tax matters took a decision on rationalising tax rates, and decided to correct duty inversions in textile and footwear sectors from January 1, 2022.The GST Council also decided to set up two groups of ministers (GoMs). The first one will examine ways to rationalise tax rates and review exemptions to boost revenues. The other one will discuss ways and means of using technology to improve compliance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gst-collection-in-october-soars-to-1-3-lakh-crore-second-highest-ever-101635764788759.html
02-11-2021||India||Covid-19 pandemic: Australia opens door to Indians vaccinated with Covaxin||Australia on Monday said Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin vaccine would be a recognised vaccine for international travellers as part of the country’s efforts to safely open up travel.The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) of Australia said both Covaxin and BBIBP-CorV , manufactured by China’s Sinopharm, “would be ‘recognised’ for the purpose of establishing a traveller’s vaccination status”.The move is expected to benefit thousands of Indian students and professionals waiting to join educational courses or return to jobs in Australia.“This will have significant impacts for the return of international students, and travel of skilled and unskilled workers to Australia,” TGA said.The recognition of Covaxin came exactly a month after TGA recognised Covishield, the Indian version of the AstraZeneca vaccine, for allowing international travellers into Australia.The recognition for Covaxin will apply to travellers aged 12 and over vaccinated with the dose, TGA said. The body said it obtained additional information in recent weeks demonstrating that Covaxin provides protection and potentially reduces the “likelihood that an incoming traveller would transmit COVID-19 infection to others while in Australia or become acutely unwell due to COVID-19”.This information was provided to TGA from the vaccine’s sponsor “and/or the World Health Organisation”.Covaxin is currently awaiting emergency use authorisation by WHO.TGA further said, “Importantly, recognition of Covaxin, and BBIBP-CorV, along with the previously announced recognition of Coronavac (manufactured by Sinovac, China) and Covishield (manufactured by AstraZeneca, India), means many citizens of China and India as well as other countries in our region where these vaccines have been widely deployed will now be considered fully vaccinated on entry to Australia.”Australian officials had earlier said that foreign students, including Indians, will be able to start returning towards the end of this year and the beginning of 2022, ahead of the start of the first semester in February-March.India is the second largest source of foreign students in Australia, behind China. During 2019-20, Indian students contributed $6.6 billion to the Australian economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-pandemic-australia-opens-door-to-indians-vaccinated-with-covaxin-101635750027954.html

Cardiac diseases, sudden deaths are rising||The untimely demise of the 46-year-old actor Puneeth Raj Kumar, reportedly from a heart attack after a two-hour workout, has triggered a question. How can someone so young, fit, with a daily exercise regimen, and no symptoms of ill-health, have a heart attack and die?

In the case of Delhi’s particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution, this statement would seem to ring true. Wealthier households are more likely to be located in quiet and leafy neighbourhoods, far away from busy urban intersections. They are more likely to spend their time indoors, and not in the dusty streets outside.
02-11-2021||Today's||Running – not walking – the talk on climate||India’s targets for the climate crisis, announced by Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi in Glasgow are bold and ambitious — and challenging. But given the enormity of the crisis, India is not just walking the talk, but running it.Historically, India has not been a contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. From 1870 to 2019, its emissions add up to a minuscule 4% of the global total. It was lambasted as the world’s third-highest polluter in 2019, but its scale of emissions stands at 2.88 CO2 gigatonnes (GT) compared to the two highest polluters: China, at 10.6 GT and the US, at 5 GT. This while India needs to meet the energy needs of millions of its people.From every angle, India did not have to make these global targets to reduce its carbon emissions. Despite this, India’s climate targets are laudable, and they show the developed world that it means business.Let’s decode the targets: The most important is the national commitment to “reduce projected carbon emissions by 1 billion tonnes from 2021 to 2030.” Taking a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, carbon emissions are projected to be 4.48 Gt in 2030. This commitment means that India’s carbon emissions would now be 3.48 Gt in 2030. In other words, the country has set an extremely high target to cut 22% from BAU.But this does not explain the real change that we have set ourselves to achieve. India’s annual per capita emissions would be roughly 3 tonnes in the BAU scenario — still much lower than most industrialised countries. But now, in the new scenario, emissions will be 2.3 tonnes per capita by 2030.If you compare this to the rest of the world, the sheer scale of the transformation is apparent. The US, even after the 50% reduction target set by President Joe Biden (which it is in danger of not meeting because of the stalemate in Congress) will see a comparable number of 9.42 tonnes of CO2 per capita in 2030. China, as it has not set any emission reduction target, will actually see the number go up from 7.3 tonnes to 9 tonnes of CO2 per capita in 2030.India’s climate commitment is a challenge for the rest to follow. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), global emissions must be 18.22 GT in 2030 for the world to stay below a 1.5°C rise in temperature. If you take the global population in 2030, this means that every person in the world can only emit some 2.14 tonnes of CO2. India’s per capita comes close.The Conference of the Parties (COP) 26 target has to be to match this in every industrialised country. The United Kingdom (UK) — the host — has an ambitious climate plan of 2.7 tonnes per capita — higher than India, and above what the world needs in 2030. Australia, Canada, the European Union (EU), Russia, the US, and China are all way above this. Russia tops this at 13.5 tonnes of CO2 per capita in 2030.Most importantly, as carbon dioxide emissions accumulate in the atmosphere for 150-200 years, they force temperatures to rise. India has committed not to add to this burden. This natural debt of the industrialised world and China now needs to be paid. And this is why PM Modi has rightly said a massive transfer of funds is required, and that these funds must be measurable. It is ironic that funding for the climate crisis remains non-transparent and without verification.The remaining targets — to reach 500 GW in non-fossil energy capacity; to meet 50% of energy requirements from renewable energy; and to reduce the carbon intensity of the economy by less than 45% — are the roadmap to reach the 1 billion tonnes CO2 emission reduction by 2030.This is the trajectory of growth for our future and adds substance to the 2030 goal. However, only a few countries — and not the industrialised world — have put out their carbon reduction paths with clarity. This, again, suggests what the world must do before leaving Glasgow.The question remains: Is all of this possible? In terms of the energy mix, reaching 50% electricity from renewable energy (RE) would mean that India will have to up its RE target from 450 GW in 2030 to around 630-700 GW. This is achievable, but will need huge investment. India’s coal energy in 2030 — as per estimates of the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) will be 266 GW in 2030 — which means that we are capping future growth in this globally indicted dirty energy source.India has accepted a massive transformation of its energy systems, which will be designed for the future, and compliant with the climate crisis goals.The big issue will be to ensure that growth is equitable, and that the poor are not denied their right to development in this new energy future. As we set ourselves the goal to grow without pollution, we must work on increasing clean, but affordable, energy for the poor.The last target is net-zero by 2070 — though much in the headlines is a non-issue. The fact is that for the world to reach net-zero in 2050, the industrialised world should have committed to a net-zero target of 2030 and China, 2040, at the latest. India could have then been pressured to also commit to net-zero by 2050. But now, the world has set an extremely unambitious and inequitable net-zero target, with most industrialised countries tom-tomming their goal for 2050. This will not keep the world on course to avoid the devastating impacts of the climate crisis.The agenda for COP26 is now clear: Raise the ambition of the industrialised world and commit to even greater cuts by 2030; put the spotlight on China to drastically reduce emissions; and provide the finance that is needed for the transformation — not transition — in the developing world. It’s within our reach. But will the rich world’s leaders now really run the talk?Sunita Narain is director-general, Centre for Science and Environment, New DelhiThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/running-not-walking-the-talk-on-climate-101635860026092.html
