16-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi HC directs waqf, police to inspect Markaz building to decide on reopening||The Delhi high court on Tuesday directed the Delhi Police and members of Delhi Waqf board to conduct a joint inspection of the Nizamuddin Markaz building to ascertain if it can be reopened with strict adherence to Covid-19 norms.Justice Mukta Gupta instructed that five members each from the Delhi Police and the petitioners (Delhi Waqf Board) visit markaz complex and apprise the court of the various areas in the building and their purposes. The Markaz building comprises the Masjid Bangley Wali (the mosque), Madarsa Kashif-ul-uloom (the madrasa) and an attached hostel.The court, while hearing a plea by the Delhi Waqf Board seeking to de-seal the Nizamuddin Markaz building, where a Tablighi Jamaat congregation was held amid the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020, said it is undisputed that the entire building is divided into three parts and the protocols for each of part would be different.“Place on record the map that this is the area of worship, this is the area of congregation and this is the hostel area,” the court said.“Since the guidelines of the DDMA (Delhi Disaster Management Authority) in relation to these three areas are distinct, a joint inspection of by the Delhi Police, including the SHO of the station of concerned, and the authorised representatives of the petitioners will be carried out so as to demarcate the three areas and thereafter necessary directions on following the DDMA guidelines in each of these areas can be determined,” the court said in its oral order. During the proceedings, senior advocate Sanjoy Ghose, appearing for the waqf board, urged the court that at least the mosque part of the complex must be allowed to be reopened after the inspection and demarcation exercise.Appearing for the Centre, counsel Rajat Nair said the inspection may be carried out, but a decision can be taken thereafter. He said currently, prayers are being offered and only after the inspection report could it be decided as to which areas should be regulated.The court granted 15 days to submit the inspection report and posted the matter for hearing to January 12.The board, in its plea filed through advocate Wajeeh Shafiq, contended that even after Unlock1 guidelines permitted religious places outside containment zones to be opened, the markaz complex continues to be locked up.It further contended that even if the premises are part of any criminal investigation or trial, keeping it “under lock and out of bounds” was a “primitive method” of inquiry process.On April 15, the court allowed 50 people to offer namaz five times a day at the Nizamuddin Markaz during Ramzan, saying there is no direction from the DDMA to close down places of worship.The court allowed namaz to be offered on “the first floor above the basement” of the mosque, making clear that it has to be opened “strictly in accordance” with the DDMA’s April 10 notification and other standard operating protocols.Several FIRs have been registered under the Epidemic Diseases Act, the Disaster Management Act, Foreigners Act and various provisions of the Indian Penal Code after a Tablighi Jamaat event was held at the markaz, allegedly in violation of Covid-19 protocols, and the subsequent stay of foreigners there during the lockdown last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hc-directs-waqf-police-to-inspect-markaz-building-to-decide-on-reopening-101637087309922.html
16-11-2021||Pune||MSEDCL cuts power to 800 Pune ZP schools over non-payment of bills||PUNE As per the information released by Pune Zilla Parishad’s chief executive officer (CEO) Ayush Prasad on Tuesday, electricity supply to 800 schools has been disconnected by Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) over non-payments of the bills. There are a total 3,639 schools operated by the Zilla Parishad in the district and 800 of them are now in the dark over pending electricity bills. MSEDCL officials said that apart from non-payment of bills there is no reason to disconnect electricity supply of schools and Zilla Parishad Pune should pay the pending dues. “The total pending bill amount is Rs2.28 core. After every vacation we take stock about the status of electricity supply in the schools. This information came forth after that,” said Prasad.“We have asked the local authorities to assist in the payment of bills from their funds. We have assured MSEDCL that the bills would be paid. In 639 schools quarantine centres were operated. So there is an issue whether these electricity bills should be paid by the school or through the state disaster relief fund,” said Prasad.MSEDCL officials said that supply would be restored once bills are paid. “MSEDCL is already in a fragile state as electricity bills worth Rs72,000 crore are pending from consumers of various categories. ZP conducted a meeting on November 11 and this issue of schools was highlighted. Connection of any consumer who fails to pay bills on time is cut after issuing a notice. There is no other reason for disconnecting the supply. ZP should pay the bills. It can be paid in installments as well,” said Rajendra Pawar, superintending engineer, Pune rural circle MSEDCL. The Zilla Parishad administration claimed that it has taken steps to resolve this problem. “In the last two days many school administrators have started the process of payments. We have asked local authorities such as gram panchayats to assist from their funds. It would be the responsibility of MSEDCL to resume electricity supply immediately, once the bills are paid. I assured MSEDCL that the bills would be paid, but electricity supply should be resumed for the sake of the students,” said Prasad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/msedcl-cuts-power-to-800-zp-schools-over-non-payment-of-bills-101637087129712.html
16-11-2021||Mumbai||Led by part-time CM, MVA most corrupt government: Devendra Fadnavis||Terming the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, led by “part time” chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray the “most corrupt” regime, the Bharatiya Janata Party’s state executive passed resolutions to condemn ‘criminalisation of politics’ and highlight the plights of various stakeholders of the society owing to the failure of the state government. The state executive meeting held in Mumbai on Tuesday was attended by all key leaders from the Maharashtra unit as well as national leaders and in-charges, including national general secretary CT Ravi and Dilip Saikiya, national joint general secretary Shivprakash, among others. In his concluding speech, leader of opposition and former CM Devendra Fadnavis hit out at MVA government. Fadnavis said the Thackeray government has lost credibility owing to its failure on every front. “There is no presence of government felt. CM has no command over his cabinet. The ministers are busy with corruption and illegal liquor and gambling dens are on the rise with the help of political patronage. Women are not safe in the state. This sort of corruption and failure was witnessed never in the state,” Fadnavis said. While addressing party workers, Fadnavis said they should fight for people and take all the stakeholders in the society along, without waiting for power. He also said that there was an attempt to polarise minorities through the violent incidents in Amravati, Nanded and Malegaon. He said the incidents were a conspiracy by the ruling parties by misleading people over the purported atrocities against Muslims in Tripura. CT Ravi, taking a dig at Thackeray, said the Shiv Sena chief is a part-time CM. “Hindus are facing attacks on the soil, which is known after [Sena supremo and CM’s father] late Balasaheb Thackeray. The ruling party [Shiv Sena] has become a family party after it snapped ties with Hindutva. The family is enjoying prosperity while Maharashtra is going through destruction. People are eager to do away with the incumbent state government. I am sure that the state government will collapse soon. If they [the ruling parties] have courage, they should face elections by dissolving the Assembly. BJP will form the government single-handedly,” he said. State BJP chief Chandrakant Patil said the party will hold 20,000 ‘corner meetings’ across Maharashtra to highlight the failure of the government and to voice the plights of the common people. He also announced a massive rally in Mumbai against the state government and its “anti-people” policies. The state executive also passed a resolution to congratulate Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the “commendable job” done by the Central government in administering more than 1.09 billion doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/led-by-part-time-cm-mva-most-corrupt-government-devendra-fadnavis-101637087069869.html
16-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi asks Centre to clarify data in SC affidavit on stubble fires||New Delhi: Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai on Tuesday asked his counterpart in the Union government, Bhupender Yadav, to clarify the exact contribution of stubble burning in Delhi’s air, referring to contradictory data submitted by the Centre in an affidavit to the Supreme Court on Monday. The Union government on Monday submitted before the Supreme Court that stubble burning is not a prime cause of pollution, adding that it contributes just around 10% to the total pollution. But the affidavit, placed by the Centre before the court in the same matter, also contains a finding that the stubble burning has been contributing about 35% to 40% of the total pollution load in Delhi-NCR. Interestingly the same affidavit, at another point, refers to a scientific study to maintain that stubble burning contributes a meagre 4% to PM 2.5 and PM 10 pollutants during the pre-winter and winter weeks. The source of this scientific study has not been named in the affidavit.“On Monday, there was a debate between experts and sections of the media on what is the exact contribution of stubble burning to Delhi’s PM 2.5 concentration. While the affidavit said the contribution was 4% , another section in the same affidavit says the contribution of stubble burning to Delhi is 35-40%. Either the 4% figure is correct, or the 40% figure is right, both cannot be correct,” said Rai during a press conference on Tuesday. He asked the union environment minister to verify the contribution, and clarify the data so that corrective measures can be taken. Quoting the data from the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), a body under the Union ministry of earth sciences, Rai said that the daily contribution of stubble burning to Delhi’s PM 2.5 levels between November 4 and 14 was around 31%. “This body also falls under the central government, so which figure is correct?,” asked Rai, stating a Special Investigation Team (SIT) formed to tackle a 4% percent contribution will work quite differently from an SIT formed to tackle a 40% load. “I request the minister to look into this matter and give everyone clarity on stubble burning and its contribution,” he said.A senior union environment ministry official on condition of anonymity, said there is a difference between the two figures, as one represents real-time concentration for the day, whereas the other figure of 4 percent is averaged out through the year. “There is a clear explanation in the affidavit submitted and the source of these,” said the official. According to the Safar data, the contribution from stubble burning to pollution in Delhi was 25% on November 4, 36% on November 5, 41% on November 6, and it peaked at 48% on November 7. By November 14, this came down to 31%. The Supreme Court had on Monday asked the Centre to hold an emergency meeting on air pollution within 24 hours. The meeting was organised on Tuesday by the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) with Delhi and the states of Punjab, Haryana, UP and Rajasthan. Rai said the Delhi government suggested implementing work from home across Delhi-NCR, a ban on construction activities in the region and shutting down industries in Delhi-NCR, if required. “We have already imposed a ban on construction activities in Delhi, but we have asked the commission to impose this across NCR. Similarly, like Delhi, all government staff in NCR may work from home. If required, we have also suggested shutting down industries,” said Rai. To continue acting on local sources of pollution, the minister said the Delhi government will launch phase-two of the ‘Red Light On, Gaadi Off’ campaign from November 19. Phase-one of the campaign was held between October 18, till November 18. “Due to poor air quality, we have decided to extend the campaign. Phase-two of the campaign will run for 15 days.” he said. Delhi’s air quality deteriorated to the ‘severe’ category on Tuesday, touching an air quality index (AQI) of 403 (severe) according to CPCB’s daily bulletin. In comparison, the AQI on Monday was 353 (very poor). Agencies say low wind speeds across Delhi, even during the day, are trapping pollutants locally and not allowing dispersal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-asks-centre-to-clarify-data-in-sc-affidavit-on-stubble-fires-101637086889723.html
16-11-2021||Mumbai||Congress MLA writes to Sonia Gandhi, claims ill-treatment by party’s Mumbai chief||The differences within the Mumbai unit of Congress have surfaced again as its Bandra (East) legislator Zeeshan Siddique has written to party president Sonia Gandhi, alleging about the “ill-treatment” meted out to him by Mumbai chief Bhai Jagtap during a recent public protest. In a letter Siddique, the youngest lawmaker in the current state legislature and son of former state minister Baba Siddique, has said that during a morcha at Dadar, Jagtap used foul language in the presence of senior leaders. “Before the protest, a delegation of leaders went to Dr BR Ambedkar’s memorial Raj Gruha to pay respects to the architect of the Constitution of India. Senior leader KC Venugopalji and HK Patilji had joined the delegation. Despite being one of the only four Mumbai legislators representing the party, my name was not on the list. Being an elected representative, when the police officers were willing to let me go [to the memorial], Jagtapji rushed out and told the personnel not to allow me to be a part of the delegation. When I requested that he should protect me as he is my president, he used foul language for me. ‘Go to hell, if you are feeling bad about it’, he said to me (sic),” the Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) has alleged in his letter. Siddique has also claimed that Jagtap pushed him after visiting Raj Gruha and used derogatory words for his community. He further said that his supporters were angry and wanted to retaliate, but he stopped them from doing so. Responding to Siddique’s claims, Jagtap said he was hurt by the allegations levelled by the MLA against him. “They [allegations] by are shocking. Throughout my political career, I have been a true believer of secularism and have followed the Gandhian ideology. I cannot say anything more about the allegations,” he said. Siddique had written a similar letter to Gandhi in June against Jagtap, accusing the city chief of “obstructing” the work in the MLA’s constituency. He had said Jagtap was supporting those who were sacked from Congress for anti-party activities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/congress-mla-writes-to-sonia-gandhi-claims-ill-treatment-by-party-s-mumbai-chief-101637086829724.html
16-11-2021||Lucknow||Lucknow admn to set up cloth banks to help poor tide over winter||To help the poor and the needy sail through the harsh winter, the Lucknow district administration is going to set up at least five cloth banks. Officials said they were chalking out a plan to ensure that the stocked clothes reached the poor. “It has been observed that many homeless people are forced to spend the nights in the open, that too without proper woollens. Hence, we have decided to set up five cloth banks, covering all corners of the city, to provide beddings and woollens to the homeless,” said Abhishek Prakash, district magistrate, while addressing a meeting on Rain Baseras. The DM said commoners, NGOs, corporate houses and others would be roped in to run these banks. “We will appeal to people, NGOs and others to donate with an open heart. We will accept bed sheets, old blankets, old quilts, sweaters and other woollens,” he said. For those who cannot come over to the banks to deposit old cloths, there will be a dedicated courier service. “The service man would collect the old clothes from the house and deliver it at the banks,” added the DM. Once the clothes are collected, the banks would be made open to the needy people. The remaining clothes would be transported to the Rain Baseras where they will be distributed among the gathering. However, the DM said the administration was yet to finalise the date when these banks would get operational. The administration is also going to increase the numbers of Rain Baseras to accommodate the maximum numbers of homeless. The DM has also directed the Nagar Nigam and other departments to give a facelift to the existing Rain Baseras. “We are also preparing a list of the old government establishments that would be transformed into Rain Baseras,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lucknow-admn-to-set-up-cloth-banks-to-help-poor-tide-over-winter-101637086772406.html

Earlier in October, RTA had approved an increase in fares by Rs2 for the first 1.5 km and Rs1 for every km thereafter. The decision, which was to come into effect from November 8. This was then put on hold.Now, fares have been increased by Rs3 for the first 1.5 km and Rs2 for every km thereafter The revised fares for three-seater autorickshaws will come in effect from November 22 in Baramati, besides Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad. This decision by RTA was taken on recommendations made by the Khatua committee report as auto unions were demanding fare hikes following a rise of Rs4 per kg for CNG during the past few days. The existing auto rickshaw fares are Rs18 for the first 1.5km and Rs12.31 for every kilometre thereafter. A review meeting of the Pune RTO was held at Pune district collector’s office on October 12, at which discussions over the recommendations given by the Khatua committee report were made. The committee declared the revised rates of Rs20 for first 1.5 km and Rs13 for every kilometre thereafter. Auto unions strongly opposed this decision and on Tuesday revised rates were declared.

Apart from these three jurisdictions, an additional 40 per cent will be applicable during night hours for the rest of the district. “Passengers travelling with luggage will have to pay Rs3 per bag of 60 by 40 centimetres. At the same time, auto drivers have been given time till December 31, 2021, for meter calibration with the revised fares. And most importantly, only those auto drivers will be allowed to take the revised fares from the passengers who have their meter calibrated for revised fares,” said Pune regional transport officer Ajit Shinde. Autorickshaw unions are happy with the decision. “We are happy that RTO listened to our demands and finally gave a fare hike. Now we will look to all the auto drivers to complete their meter calibration process,” said Bappu Bhave, president, Pune auto-rickshaw federation. On other hand the passengers are not so happy with the decision. Kiran Sawale a regular auto user said, “I often take an auto to go to my workplace and now if these revised rates are going to be implemented it will be costlier travelling.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/autorickshaw-fares-for-pune-pcmc-revised-from-nov-22-rs21-for-first-1-5-km-101637086771278.html
16-11-2021||Mumbai||Brace for major traffic jams from next month; BMC set to repair 808 city roads||Expect traffic diversions and blockages as the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is set to start repair work on 808 city roads measuring around 274 km. The civic body is expected to finalise bids worth ₹2,200 crore by the end of this month, paving the way for the work to start.According to BMC officials, the proposed repair work across the city, western and eastern suburbs include a total of 808 roads, both major and minor. Some of them include Cumbala Hill Lane, Kamathipura 10th Lane in South Mumbai, Kamraj Nagar Road, Ramabai Road in Eastern suburbs and Military Camp junction, Kalina Navpada Road, Bandra East, Shastri Nagar Road, Santacruz East Aarey Colony Road in Western suburbs. Under the repair, maintenance and strengthening work, the BMC is converting the surface of all city roads from paver block/ asphalt to cement and concrete. The contractor that will be appointed for repair works will be responsible for clearance from the Mumbai Traffic Police and will have to manage traffic, including installing safety barricades during the construction phase.The construction period for all the 808 roads in the city varies from road to road and ranges from a year to two years, depending on the challenges at the construction site. According to sources from the BMC, it has received bids that are 15-20% below the estimates despite re-tendering the number of roads. On September 13, Additional Municipal Commissioner P Velrasu in its letter had sought justification from the deputy municipal commissioner of infrastructure (BMC) on how the quality will be maintained amid the contractors quoting below 30% of the estimated cost. Post this, the BMC had re-floated all the bids citing there would be quality concerns.The last date for submitting re-floated tenders was earlier this month, and the BMC is now scrutinising the bids it received. A BMC official said, “The bids are still being scrutinised but it looks that they are 15-20 per cent lower than the estimates. The final call will be taken by the senior officials. We may be in a position to submit the proposals to the standing committee for approval by month end.”P Velrasu, Additional Municipal Commissioner of the BMC said, “We are expecting to table the proposals in the standing committee in the coming days and post that approval, the repair work may start from next month.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/brace-for-major-traffic-jams-from-next-month-bmc-set-to-repair-808-city-roads-101637086709876.html
16-11-2021||Lucknow||Akhilesh Yadav’s ‘political rath’ to traverse Purvanchal e-way today||LUCKNOW: Samajwadi Party (SP) national president Akhilesh Yadav will traverse the entire 340-km Purvanchal Expressway on ‘political rath’ on Wednesday “in a symbolic reiteration” that the expressway was the previous SP government’s project. Before this, on Tuesday, hours ahead of the expressway’s inauguration by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the SP cadres did “symbolic floral inauguration” in all the districts falling on the longest expressway in the country. SP state spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary said: “Akhileshji will begin the fourth leg of Vijay Yatra in the morning (on Wednesday) from Ghazipur and end it in Lucknow the same evening.” Ghazipur is one end of the expressway, Lucknow the other. On Tuesday, hours before the PM landed at the Sultanpur IAF emergency landing airstrip on the Purvanchal expressway to inaugurate the expressway, the SP workers wearing red caps rode bicycles and did “floral inauguration” of the six-lane road in various districts along it. The SP workers acted on instructions that party chief Akhilesh Yadav had issued the day before. As the expressway was blocked for traffic on Tuesday at many points in all the districts due to the PM’s event, in many places SP workers climbed (carrying their bicycles) on the expressway from the sides and then rode along, showering flowers. Akhilesh said the Samajwadi Expressway’s name was changed as part of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government’s habit of renaming of the SP’s projects and re-inaugurating them. On Tuesday, Yadav tweeted pictures of the “inauguration” and the foundation-laying ceremony of the expressway by him as chief minister in December 2016. “How will the BJP wipe out from the pages of history that the foundation for the expressway was laid on December 16,” he said later in a statement. Originally, Akhilesh was scheduled to take the expressway for his Ghazipur to Azamgarh Vijay Yatra. But the Ghazipur district administration denied permission. Yadav also said that the BJP was five years behind SP’s rule “in the way it was doing the inauguration”. He added fighter jets had landed on the Agra-Lucknow Expressway when the SP ruled the state and the BJP government copied it for the Purvanchal Expressway. Hours before the inauguration of the expressway Akhilesh Yadav alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Centre was trying to steal the credit for the work done by his party. Akhilesh Yadav’s tweet, roughly translated from Hindi, read: “The ribbon came from Lucknow and the scissors came from New Delhi. There is a ‘khicham-khichai (tug-of-war)’ to take credit for the work of SP. It is hoped that till now the people of Lucknow must have memorised the length of the ‘Samajwadi Purvanchal Expressway.” And after the inauguration in Sultanpur, Akhilesh said in a statement: “Even as the (UP) assembly elections are getting closer, the BJP is frightened over the rising public anger against it. That’s why the chief minister who sat idle for 4.5 years is on foundation-laying and inauguration spree and spinning false stories of development.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/akhilesh-yadav-s-political-rath-to-traverse-purvanchal-e-way-today-101637086589700.html
16-11-2021||Mumbai||Eastern Freeway to be extended from Chembur to Thane||To make travel between Mumbai and Thane seamless, the Mumbai Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (MMRDA) has decided to extend the Eastern Freeway to Thane. The formal decision was taken in its board meeting headed by Urban Development Minister Eknath Shinde.Currently the Freeway, which starts from South Mumbai ends at Shivaji Nagar, Chembur but hits a traffic hurdle towards Thane. The Freeway has played a significant role in faster traffic movement from South Mumbai to the Central suburbs of Chembur and Ghatkopar.Shinde, who is guardian minister of Thane, has been an ardent advocate of the plan. The plan is to extend the freeway from Chheda Nagar to Anand Nagar. From there onwards, an elevated road has been planned between Anand Nagar and Saket. There will also be a creek road bypassing the busy Ghodbunder Road.“Currently we are experiencing huge traffic bottlenecks in Thane. The said plan will considerably decongest both the main roads as well as internal roads in Thane. In addition, the Saket Gaimukh bypass road will also clear off most of the traffic on Ghodbunder Road,” said Shinde.The meeting also gave in-principle approval for Kopri-Patani bridge and Kharegaon bypass road. The latter will decongest traffic in areas like Kalwa, Vitava and Kharegaon.In the last few decades, there has been a huge rise in the population in Thane due to various reasons including exorbitant realty prices in Mumbai. This has caused a huge strain on the local infrastructure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/eastern-freeway-to-be-extended-from-chembur-to-thane-101637086472405.html
16-11-2021||Mumbai||Second dose certificates not updated, complain citizens; hospitals unable to backdate||A 56-year-old woman from Borivli had taken her second shot of the Covid-19 vaccine at the state-run Sir JJ Hospital in April. When she tried to access the full vaccination certificate last week, while entering a mall, she realised that the Co-Win portal had no update on her second dose. She got in touch with the hospital where the doctors updated her certificate, but could not backdate it. The date of her second dose now shows as November 8, which is the date when she got her vaccination certificate updated. The civic body had found that nearly four lakh people from the city have missed their second dose of the vaccination. While some of them could have delayed the doses due to travel plans or other work-related issues, some may have taken the second dose outside Mumbai or other parts of the country. A section of people like the Borivli resident adds up to the statistics of unvaccinated people, due to delay or manual errors in data entry. As malls, trains, air travel and even offices have linked entry to fully vaccinated people, citizens who had earlier not accessed the certificates are now stumbling upon such issues. “In the initial phase of the vaccination drive, our staff was manually entering data in the portal,” said Dr Lalit Sankhe, nodal officer of the Sir JJ Hospital vaccination centre. “We were vaccinating nearly 2,000 people in a day and all of the data had to be entered in the portal at the end of the day. Because of the high workload, updates of some beneficiaries may have been missed out,” he said. According to Dr Sankhe, the Co-Win portal is a real-time system. “We are therefore unable to make any backdated entries,” he said adding that the Sir JJ Hospital centre has administered nearly 100,000 doses to date and fewer than 30 people have turned up at the hospital as their certificates were not updated. In another case, a 51-year-old Churchgate resident faced a similar issue. She had taken her second dose at the state-run Cama Hospital way back in May, but realised that her certificate was not updated when she was making travel plans. Her certificate too could not be backdated. “We are getting a few such cases. We promptly verify the documents of the beneficiaries, cross-check with our records and give them an updated certificate,” said Dr Tushar Palve, medical superintendent of Cama Hospital. “Verification is important because we have had a few cases wherein people turned up at the hospital claiming to have got vaccinated, but there were no records about them. We believe that these people are among those who are hesitant to take the jabs but wanted a certificate because a lot of things are now linked with vaccination,” he said. Mumbai’s immunisation officer Dr Sheela Jagtap said that the 24 war rooms in the city have been tasked with reaching out to every person who has missed out on the second dose and updating the data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/second-dose-certificates-not-updated-complain-citizens-hospitals-unable-to-backdate-101637086296074.html
16-11-2021||Mumbai||After lull of 20 months, big fat weddings back; traders hopeful of great season||With the decline in the Covid-19 cases and the Maharashtra government easing restrictions, the ‘big fat Indian weddings’ are back on the cards. After a lull of about 20 months owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, hotels, banquet halls and open grounds across the state are witnessing hectic activities as people have now started holding grand-scale weddings. All the banquet halls in leisure destinations such as Alibag, Lonavala and Karjat have been fully booked till January.The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) has estimated 2.5 million weddings across the country between November 14 and December 13, which are likely to generate business more than ₹3 lakh crore. Of the 2.5 million weddings, 400,000 are slated to be held in Maharashtra alone and are likely to generate business of approximately worth ₹20,000 crore.The stakeholders from the hospitality and other sectors feel that the government should now relax the restriction imposed on the number of guests allowed for wedding ceremonies. The state has allowed 200 people for weddings in open places, while in closed-hall venues, the number has been limited to 100 attendees or 50% capacity of the venue, whichever is less.St Regis Hotel at Lower Parel said banquet bookings, which suffered the most during the pandemic, have bounced back to business. “We will host at least 20-30 weddings in November and 40 in December. Weddings are one of the biggest revenue generators for us and we had suffered a lot during the pandemic. The business is reviving now,” said Nicholas Dumbell, general manager, St Regis.Radisson Blu Mumbai International Airport Hotel, which has two banquet halls along with a lawn, is also seeing many bookings. “It is welcome change as people are back to holding grand celebrations. The confidence [in the industry] is back,” said Pankaj Saxena, the hotel’s general manager.“We had a fabulous Diwali and now even the wedding scene is all set to dazzle in the coming months. People have again started spending on celebrations,” said Rajendra Bathiya, executive chairman, CAIT (Maharashtra), adding that more than 25 sectors, including catering, decorations, food items, flowers, jewellery, transport, entertainment and clothing are directly related to the wedding industry. “This will give a great boost to both various businesses as well as generate large-scale employment,” he added.According to representatives from Revmerito, which is a revenue management consultancy firm for around 75 hotels in India, people prefer nearby destinations for weddings. “As most of the destinations abroad are closed, we are witnessing a huge response for places such as Alibag, Lonavala, Wada and Karjat, where people are holding destination weddings. Opulence Resort at Alibag, which started in October, is fully booked for weddings till January-end,” said Vishal Ajwani, director, Revmerito.The wedding industry had suffered a lot during the pandemic as there was hardly any activity during the lockdown. Besides, the government had restricted the number of guests initially to 20. In the second wave which started in February, many weddings were cancelled.The Indian Bullion and Jewellers Association (IBJA) said jewellers are expecting record sales this wedding season. “Many families had postponed their celebrations in the past two years and are now splurging on jewellery,” said Kumar Jain, president, IBJA (Mumbai). “People saved a lot of money during the pandemic as they did not travel abroad or indulge in eating out or shopping. They are now buying jewellery,” he added.The Bombay Caterers Association (BCA) said though the bookings have started, many grand weddings have shifted either out of Mumbai owing to the restriction on guests. “As Mumbai has a strict rule on restrictions on the number of guests, people are now holding grand celebrations outside the city limits. As Covid-19 cases are declining, we are seeing restrictions being eased all around. So the cap on guests should also be relaxed further,” said BCA spokesperson Lalit Jain.Savio D’sa, a hospitality consultant who also hosts wedding parties, said the guest restrictions need to be waived off at the earliest. “If there are more guests, more will be money spent [for the ceremonies], thereby helping the state exchequer. This [rule on guest limitation] needs to be rectified at the earliest,” said D’sa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/after-lull-of-20-months-big-fat-weddings-back-traders-hopeful-of-great-season-101637086289763.html
16-11-2021||Delhi||‘Pollution-related’: Pvt hospital in Delhi’s diagnosis for respiratory problems||New Delhi: With high levels of pollution driving up cases of respiratory problems and aggravation of chronic conditions like asthma, a private hospital in the Capital plans to write “pollution-related” as diagnosis for such patients. “We have decided to write ‘pollution-related’ or ‘triggered by pollution’ as a diagnosis for people who come in with respiratory symptoms to the hospital this time of the year. It should become a diagnostic criterion,” said Dr Sumit Ray, head of the department of critical care at Holy Family hospital in Okhla.Clinicians have for years been pointing out that increase in pollution levels drive up cases of respiratory conditions. “Respiratory symptoms can be clearly connected to increasing levels of pollution. Usually symptoms in people with asthma or COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) are triggered either by infection or due to exposure to pollution. So, what we need to do is, check for an acute exacerbation, a spike in the number of such cases, and rule out infection,” said Dr Ray.With temperatures and air quality dipping in Delhi, hospitals across the city have seen a 20-30% increase in the number of patients coming in with respiratory symptoms in the last 10 days, doctors said.“Exacerbation in symptoms of those who have conditions like asthma and COPD is usually triggered by three things – viral infections that are common during the change in season, high levels of pollution and exposure to certain gases that are usually released in the atmosphere during Diwali,” said Dr Neeraj Gupta, a professor in the department of pulmonary medicine at Safdarjung hospital. He, however, did not want to comment on whether “pollution” should be used as a separate diagnostic criteria.Dr Karan Madan, associate professor in the department of pulmonary medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), said that experts should come together to set a criteria for what can qualify as a “pollution-related” diagnosis.“One can say that certain conditions are triggered and exacerbated by pollution. But labelling is a challenge. All of us know that pollution is leading to an increase in respiratory symptoms, but establishing cause and effect in one particular case is difficult. The experts should come together and define the symptoms or behaviours that happen due to pollution. Once that comes in the medical literature, then we can have a criteria for such a diagnosis,” he said. Dr Ray added that even though there is an increase in cases of heart attack and stroke when the pollution levels are high, determining the role of pollution in individual cases is difficult. “Unlike the acute respiratory symptoms, it takes years for pollution to cause a heart attack or a stroke. We know that the incidence (of respiratory symptoms) goes up in winter – and it cannot be only due to the cold because earlier the numbers used to go up during the really cold months of December and January. Now, we have already started seeing an increase,” said Dr Ray.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/pollutionrelatedpvt-hospital-in-delhi-s-diagnosis-for-respiratory-problems-101637086229907.html
16-11-2021||Mumbai||Financial, logistical support reduce paediatric cancer treatment abandonment rates: TMH analysis||A holistic cancer care approach that includes financial, logistical, nutritional and treatment support has considerably brought down the treatment abandonment rate among paediatric cancer patients at the Parel’s Tata Memorial Hospital (TMH). Analysis of 10-year patient data, carried out by the hospital, has revealed that the treatment abandonment rate dropped from 10.4% in 2010 to 3.7% in 2020. Preliminary data compiled up to June this year showed that the abandonment rate was around 2.4%. The hospital defines abandoned treatment as failure to begin cancer-directed treatment or to have started treatment but subsequently discontinued it at least for four weeks. Before 2010, the treatment dropouts were estimated to be more than 20%. “Financial constraints and logistical issues such as accommodation in Mumbai were among the topmost reasons for abandoning cancer treatment,” said medical oncologist Dr Shripad Banavali, who is also the director of academics at the TMH. “We probed all these reasons and decided to tackle every aspect that prompted parents to discontinue their child’s treatment mid-way or not initiate the treatment at all,” he said. In 2009, an internal audit conducted by the TMH found that nearly 70% of paediatric patients coming to the facility were from a lower socioeconomic background, about 60% of the parents were illiterate and almost 90% of the patients travelled from long distances for treatment. Of the 1400 paediatric patients who came to TMH in 2009, over 20% had abandoned treatment, the audit revealed. A telephonic audit of families, who abandoned treatment, revealed that lack of quality and affordable housing in Mumbai, travel from long distances, cost of food and local travel, loss of income, lack of family donors for blood components, misplaced faith in alternative medicine, and a sense of hopelessness regarding the curability of cancers were among the key reasons. Based on the findings of the audit, the hospital set up the Improving Paediatric Cancer Care and Treatment (ImPaCCT) Foundation in 2010 to ensure that no child coming to TMH goes without treatment or leaves treatment mid-way. “To start with, we got some funds from a United States-based organisation to hire support staff,” said Shalini Jatia, secretary of ImPaCCT Foundation. “We hired data managers, paediatric social workers and formed a paediatric social support group which included a network of hospital staff, NGO’s among others and worked out a system wherein all paediatric cancer patients are covered for everything right from the time they arrive at the hospital,” said Jatia, adding that from smaller contributions in the initial years, the foundation now raises nearly ₹30 crore to ₹35 crore annually. The foundation leverages funds through four sources- corporates, government, non-profits and individual donors. It covers accommodation for every paediatric patient enrolling in the general category and their parents or caregivers and offers meals and snacks to minimise the out-of-pocket expenditure. The accommodation given to the children is commonly in non-profit run homes, guest houses etc, that are connected to the hospital through shuttle services to avoid travel expenditure. Treatment time for most childhood cancers ranges from six months to 18 months. Blood cancers — leukaemias and lymphomas — and brain tumours are among the commonest childhood cancers. “With timely and complete treatment, the outcomes of childhood cancers are extremely good,” said Dr Girish Chinnaswamy, head of paediatric oncology at TMH. “Unfortunately, those who abandon the treatment suffer from advanced disease and eventually succumb,” he said. An estimated 60,000 children are diagnosed with cancers in India every year. “In the West, the childhood cancer cure rates are nearly 85%, because almost every patient gets treatment. In India, the cure rates would be only about 35% to 45% as a large number of patients don’t get treatment,” said Dr Chinnaswamy adding that TMH has a 75% childhood cancer cure rate. The ImPaCCT Foundation’s robust abandonment tracking system involves data managers and social workers closely following up with the child’s parents and caregivers. The team constantly counsels them, to ensure that they come back for treatment. During the pandemic, the hospital staff was actively in touch with patients on phone and WhatsApp and many patients were encouraged to get blood tests and other basic examinations done locally. “A similar holistic model can be replicated in adult cancer patients too, as the treatment abandonment rate among adults is likely to be much higher,” said Dr Banavali. The TMH is the country’s biggest cancer facility and it receives a large pool of patients under one roof. Over the years, the hospital has worked towards decentralising cancer care by starting similar centres in other parts of the country such as Varanasi, Sangrur, Guwahati among other cities. “There is a definite need to develop more cancer centres across the country, and decentralise the treatment options further so that people don’t have to travel all the way to Mumbai,” said Soumitra Ghosh, associate professor at the Centre for Health Policy, Planning and Management, Tata Institute of Social Sciences. “When patients have treatment options in their own states, their out of pocket expenditure reduces and they are more likely to continue the treatment,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/financial-logistical-support-reduce-paediatric-cancer-treatment-abandonment-rates-tmh-analysis-101637086049692.html
16-11-2021||Patna||For Chand Sarai, Poorvanchal expressway opens gateway of progress||Lucknow: When Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the Poorvanchal Expressway on Tuesday, residents of Chand Sarai village in Gosaiganj area of Lucknow saw the programme on a large screen and cheered. Small wonder they are thrilled, for the western end of the 340-km Expressway is located in the village and its construction has brought prosperity to Chand Sarai that was once called the ‘gwalon ka gaon’ (village of milkmen). “The road has brought development to our village. While some families were given handsome compensation for their land, others benefited by opening business along the road,” said Pramod Kumar, 57, pradhan of the village. The hamlet of over 6,000 residents had wide roads, concrete drains, street lights and community toilets that were made in the past three years, said Kumar. The prosperity is also reflected by the big colourful houses with wide porches that stand on both sides of the road leading to the village. Most of the houses have an SUV or two parked near the gates. The village has a government primary school but children from most households go to English medium schools in nearby Gosaiganj or in Lucknow city. Even as most of the villagers are involved in farming, everyone has contact number of the local real estate dealer. The prices of land in the village have almost doubled in the past four years and gone up 5 times since 2011. “The price of land in our village was around ₹350 per sq feet in 2011. It was around ₹600 per sq ft in 2016 but now the rates are around ₹1500 to 1700 per sq feet,” informed Mahmood Alam, 46, former village head. Alam is one of the 30 people whose land was taken for the construction of the expressway. “People in the village are approached regularly by real estate agents to broker a land deal for one or the other construction projects,” added Alam. Besides the Poorvanchal Expressway, the Lucknow-Sultanpur road also benefited the residents of the village. The Sultanpur highway linked the village to the district headquarters some 20 km in north and helped business thrive along it. Several restaurants, shopping complexes, banquet halls and higher education colleges have come up along the road that provide business and employment to the villagers reducing their dependency on roads. While highlighting the importance of the expressway and business opportunities it will bring in the coming days, they hope that a service lane will soon be made specially near the approach road of the expressway. “The absence of a service road near the approach road has turned it into an accident-prone zone. We hope that a service road will be constructed near it to facilitate easy and safe movement of local traffic,” said Sumit Kumar Pal, 55, another resident of Chand Sarai .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/for-chand-sarai-poorvanchal-expressway-opens-gateway-of-progress-101637085990136.html

The bus finally stopped after hitting a shop on Malgodam Road. The bus driver was arrested. “The bus driver seemed to have lost control on the steering and the vehicle hit several people on the road on Tuesday. Three of them, including a couple, died. The driver was arrested,” informed SP Kasganj Rohan Pramod Botre. The private bus was going through the market on Malgodam Road when it suddenly went out of control. The exact reason is yet to be assigned but it is believed that the brakes of the bus failed. The bus first struck an e-rickshaw and thereafter mowed down three people. The directionless bus stopped after hitting a shop of music instruments on Malgodam Road. Fortunately, no one in the shop was injured. Police reached the spot and sent the bodies for post mortem examination. Those killed were identified as Ramesh Kumar (50), his wife Nirmala (45) and an unidentified aged man.

16-11-2021||Lucknow||PM Modi to lay foundation of ultra-mega solar park in UP’s Jhansi on Nov 19||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will lay the foundation stone of the 600 MW ultra-mega solar park in Jhansi on November 19 in a move that seeks to convert the Bundelkhand region with abundant land and sunlight into a “solar power hub” in the state, people dealing with the issue said.Jhansi project is one of the three ultra-mega solar parks that are proposed to be set up in the region to generate 2,000 MW solar power in “plug and play mode” under the Centre’s Ultra Mega Renewable Energy Power Parks (UMREPP) scheme. “Besides the 600 MW solar park in Jhansi, the foundation stone of which is to be laid by the PM on November 19, the action is also being taken to set up a 600 MW solar park in Lalitpur and 800 MW solar park in Chitrakoot,” a senior official of the alternative energy department said. The TUSCO Ltd, a joint venture of the THDC India Ltd and the New and Renewable Energy Development Agency (UPNEDA), has been given the mandate to set up three ultra-mega solar parks to generate 2,000 MW electricity from the sunlight in Bundelkhand. The developer has already identified 2,609 acres of private land 242.3 acres of government land in six villages under the Garautha tehsil of Jhansi for the development of the solar park there.“As per the detailed project report (DPR), the total project cost of the Jhansi solar park is ₹3,013 crore of which ₹313.18 crore will be spent on the creation of the park and ₹2,700 crore will be used in setting up solar units in the park,” the official said. “The Centre will provide 30% of the project cost,” he added. The UP Power Corporation Ltd will buy the power to be generated from the solar park.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/pm-modi-to-lay-foundation-of-ultra-mega-solar-park-in-up-s-jhansi-on-nov-19-101637084729950.html
16-11-2021||Lucknow||Purvanchal E-way will be lifeline of eastern UP’s growth: UP CM||Chief minister Yogi Adityanath said on Tuesday the Purvanchal Expressway would not only be a means of transportation but will also become the lifeline of development of eastern UP that “remained neglected after Independence”.Addressing a public meeting at the inauguration programme of the Purvanchal Expressway in Sultanpur district, he said, “The foundation of the Purvanchal Expressway was laid three years back. Despite the Covid pandemic, the construction was completed on schedule and was being inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi today (Tuesday).“The inauguration of the expressway will take the development of UP to a new height. The industrial cluster being developed on both sides of the expressway will generate employment,” he added. “Within four-and-a-half years, several infrastructure and development schemes have been launched in the state. Along with the inauguration of the Purvanchal Expressway, the state government is also working to connect Bundelkhand with a new expressway. The work on Ganga expressway will start within a few days to connect western UP with eastern UP. The work on Gorakhpur link expressway and Ballia link expressway is also continuing on a war footing,” Yogi said.“Since 2014, the BJP government has made major efforts to improve public transport by spreading the Metro network in various cities. Next month, Metro services will be launched in Kanpur. Earlier, there were only two airports in the state-- in Lucknow and Varanasi. Now, taking benefits of the Centre’s UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Naagrik) scheme, nine airports are functional in the state and construction of 11 new airports is in progress,” he added.“It’s the picture of new India and new UP. Uttar Pradesh is assisting the PM’s resolve to make the country the biggest economy in the world. UP is moving fast in all sectors— infrastructure, education, health and welfare schemes. People are getting benefits of the schemes without discrimination. The symbols of faith have also been given due respect under the BJP government,” Yogi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/purvanchal-e-way-will-be-lifeline-of-eastern-up-s-growth-up-cm-101637084249775.html

The police on Monday arrested the accused and his son over the incident that took place in Samasgarh forest area, Ratibad police station in-charge Sudhesh Tiwari said. The matter came to light when a forest guard spotted the body of a woman and her six-month-old baby near Pilota nullah in Samasgarh area on Sunday. During the investigation, the victim was identified as a 25-year-old resident of Bilkisganj in Sehore district, he said. The victim had married a man from Sehore about a year ago, and had been staying with her elder sister in Ratibad for the past few days, when her infant son died due to some illness on November 4, he said.Following the death, the victim's elder sister had called their father and brother for the child's cremation, the official said. On their way for cremation on a motorcycle, the accused took the victim inside Samasgarh forest, where he allegedly raped and killed her, the official said, adding that the accused came out of the forest and narrated the incident to his son and the duo returned to the village. The accused confessed to the crime and said that the family was angry with the victim after she married against their wishes, he said.

16-11-2021||Kolkata||Bengal poll body hits pause on civic body polls, will let court decide case first||KOLKATA: The West Bengal State Election Commission on Tuesday told the Calcutta high court that it will not issue the notification for elections to any of the state’s 120-odd civic bodies till the two-judge bench decides a petition filed by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).The BJP rushed to the Calcutta high court last week after the commission accepted the ruling Trinamool Congress government’s suggestion to hold elections to the Kolkata and Howrah municipal corporations on December 19. The BJP wants the high court to order the state election commission to hold elections to all civic bodies in one go.On Tuesday, the commission, which is mandated to hold urban local body and panchayat elections, told the high court that it was in no rush and will wait for the high court to decide the petition before issuing the election notification.The assurance implies that there is a distinct possibility that the commission will have to reschedule the elections proposed for December 19.Bengal minister Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay said the commission’s decision was appropriate. “The commission did the right thing since the matter is sub judice. The polls can be held after the case is heard” said Chattopadhyay.BJP national vice-president Dilip Ghosh welcomed the development. “We have questioned the state’s decision to hold polls only in Kolkata and Howrah. Why should people in the rest of Bengal be deprived? The government cannot cite lack of manpower as an excuse to hold these elections in phases,” said Ghosh. Opposition parties in Bengal have been demanding civic elections for more than a year.The ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) controls most of the 120-odd civic bodies in Bengal. The terms of the elected boards ended over the last two years but elections were not held because of the Covid-19 pandemic. The state government appointed the elected heads of the civic boards as administrators till fresh polls are held. For example, minister Firhad Hakim, who was the mayor of Kolkata, was made head of the administrative board of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation.This decision also became a political issue on the eve of the March-April assembly polls.On March 20, the Election Commission of India, which conducted the assembly elections, passed an order saying politicians appointed as administrative heads of civic corporation and municipalities beyond their terms be replaced by government officers within 48 hours.Since the administrators were politically affiliated people the situation could “give rise to a legitimate apprehension in the mind of the voters about the fairness and impartiality of the election process,” the ECI said. The order, said the ECI, was passed “to avoid a situation where critical functions of urban local bodies are actually discharged and thereby affecting level playing field during the operation of Model Code of Conduct….” This triggered a sharp reaction among TMC leaders who saw it as a move against the ruling party prior to the eight-phase polls that began on March 27. The TMC, however, secured 213 of the state’s 294 assembly seats while the BJP won 77 against its declared target of 200.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bengal-poll-body-hits-pause-on-civic-body-polls-will-let-court-decide-case-first-101637084129479.html
16-11-2021||Dehradun||Supreme Court stays felling of 11,000 tress on Doon Expressway till November 26||The Supreme Court on Tuesday stayed felling of around 11,000 trees and plants on the Ganeshpur-Dehradun Road (NH-72A) stretch, part of the Delhi-Dehradun Economic Corridor until November 26 and also asked National Green Tribunal (NGT) to decide the plea against forest clearances granted to the Expressway.A Bench of Justices DY Chandrachud, Surya Kant, and Vikram Nath set aside the October 6 order of NGT and asked it to consider afresh a plea of NGO 'Citizens for Green Doon' which has challenged the Stage-1 and Stage-2 Clearances and tree felling permissions.It asked the NGT to pass a reasoned order on each of the averments made by the NGO and asked it to list the matter within 24 hours of filing the plea. The NGO was granted liberty to move the NGT within a week.The new six-lane Delhi-Dehradun Economic Corridor Expressway will reduce the travel time from 6.5 hours to just 2.5 hours as per the plan of the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) and would have a 12-kilometre elevated road to protect the wildlife and forests.The apex court said that the NGT's order of dismissing the plea of the NGO is in error as it did not consider the earlier judgements on the issue.The Central government has contended that the project should not have stayed in the public interest as all necessary clearances were taken by the NHAI.The NGO said that they have filed an RTI before the Divisional Forest Officer of Saharanpur seeking to know whether an order for tree felling has been passed, which was categorically denied.It stated that mitigation steps which the Centre is talking about for the protection of flora and fauna are not implemented and would destroy the forests and endanger the wildlife in the area.The apex court on November 11 had directed the Centre that there should not be any tree felling on the Ganeshpur-Dehradun Road till November 16.

16-11-2021||Lucknow||With Ayodhya a priority, UP CM likely to launch projects next month||Ayodhya has remained the focal point of the Yogi government from day one after it came to power in Uttar Pradesh in March 2017. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has been a regular visitor to Ayodhya ever since he started visiting the temple town as CM on May 31, 2017. Now, even when the government is going to complete its tenure and is preparing for the assembly polls due early next year, Ayodhya still tops the priority list of the BJP government. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath is likely to lay the foundation stones of pending projects in the temple town and will also dedicate to people some of the projects nearing completion next month. According to the Ayodhya administration, the Queen Heo Hwang-ok memorial park, a park named after a Korean queen with Ayodhya roots, and digital museum at Ram Katha Park are almost complete. A makeover of the Ayodhya railway station is also going on. The renovation work of the station and electrification of railway line is almost complete. The CM is likely to dedicate these projects to the people of Ayodhya next month. The Centre has approved 27 road projects in Ayodhya under the Pradhan Mantri Gramin Sadak Yojana. For these roads having total length of 197 km, the Modi government has sanctioned ₹132.78 crore. Construction work of these roads will start next month after CM Yogi Adityanath lays their foundation stones. The Ayodhya Development Authority is also likely to finalise the master plan of Ayodhya by December end. “Chief minister is likely to visit Ayodhya next month to inaugurate some projects that have been completed. He will also lay foundation stones of some projects,” said Ved Prakash Gupta, BJP MLA from Ayodhya (Sadar) constituency. On Deeputsav in Ayodhya on November 3, the CM had either laid foundation stones or inaugurated projects worth ₹600 crore there. Even during the pandemic phase of one–and-a-half-years, Ayodhya remained the priority of the state government. Yogi presided over the ceremony of shifting of Ram Lalla idol from makeshift temple to a pre-fabricated temple within the Ram Janmabhoomi campus on March 25, 2020. The ceremony was organised by the Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Tirath Kshetra Trust. Only priests and members of the Trust were present at the event. No locals and media persons were allowed. Then there was “bhoomi pujan” (groundbreaking ceremony) of Ram Mandir on August 5, 2020 in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi was the chief guest. The event had attracted attention worldwide. After this ceremony, the construction work of Ram Mandir began.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/with-ayodhya-a-priority-up-cm-likely-to-launch-projects-next-month-101637083712068.html
16-11-2021||Kolkata||West Bengal government launches ration at doorstep scheme||The Mamata Banerjee government in West Bengal launched the ‘Duare Ration’ (ration at doorstep) scheme on Tuesday which the administration said will benefit around 10 crores of people of the state.“This Duare Ration scheme will help 10 crore people of the state. I will request all the ration dealers to make it a success,” Banerjee said while launching the scheme and flagging off vehicles that would deliver the ration.Earlier, the Kejriwal government in Delhi decided to launch a similar ration delivery scheme from March 25 this year. The Union food and consumer affairs ministry, however, raised objections.The ‘Duare Ration’ scheme is one of the many pet projects of CM Banerjee and was announced ahead of the West Bengal assembly elections earlier this year. A section of dealers had moved the Calcutta High Court against the scheme but their plea was junked.“Some are moving court while others are creating obstacles. Don’t do this. No one should create any disturbance else the food supply department would have to step in. Ensure its success,” Banerjee told ration dealers. There are around 21000 rational dealers in the state. The government would provide a subsidy of ₹1 lakh to each dealer to purchase a delivery vehicle. The government also allowed ration dealers to recruit two assistants. The state would pay half their salaries. Each vehicle would be parked at a convenient location in a neighbourhood so that residents need not walk more than 500 metres to avail the ration.At the programme, Banerjee also inaugurated a WhatsApp chatbot for the Food and Supplies Department of the state government and a mobile application, ‘Khadya Sathi: Amar Ration Mobile App’ to help people apply for ration cards and get information about how to do it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/west-bengal-government-launches-ration-at-doorstep-scheme-101637083531013.html
16-11-2021||Lucknow||Abhyuday Yojana: Free coaching classes in all UP districts soon||Classes under the Mukhyamantri Abhyuday Yojana offering free coaching to economically weaker aspirants of competitive exams in Uttar Pradesh will now be held in every district instead of just at divisional headquarters. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath had launched the Abhyuday free coaching scheme for the aspirants of competitive examinations on February 15 earlier this year. As part of the scheme, the UP government has set up coaching centres offering free classes to prepare the students for Joint Entrance Exam (JEE) for engineering, National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) for the medical aspirants, the entrance exam for the National Defence Academy (NDA), Combined Defence Services (CDS) examination and Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) exams.The platform has over 500 IAS officers, over 450 IPS officers, over 300 IFS officers and several experts on various subjects who contribute by creating educational content through physical classes and virtual sessions for civil services and other competitive exams’ aspirants.A portal http://www.abhyuday.up.gov.in/ too has been launched for the benefit of the students. These training classes were given online during the multiple lockdowns that the state went through. Gradually, the Abhyuday coaching centres were set up at the divisional levels in the first phase and is now being followed up at the district level in the next phase, said officials of the state social welfare department in the know of the development.For paving way for the classes to begin at the district level, a missive has already been sent to all divisional commissioners and district magistrates on behalf of the director of social welfare department. Now preparations were on to constitute district level committees, they added.Confirming the development, Deputy director (social welfare), Prayagraj, Manjushree Srivastava said, “This time, classes are to be held in all the districts of the state.” “State social welfare director’s letter has arrived in this regard. District level committees are being constituted. This is the reason why the classes, which were to start from November 15, have been stopped for the time being. As soon as the committees are constituted in all districts of the division, the classes will start simultaneously in all 75 districts,” she said.“For this, there will now also be a designated officer from among the respective district inspector of schools, district social welfare officer or district magistrate,” the officials said.Senior IAS officer and director general, UP Academy of Administration and Management, Lucknow, L Venkateshwar Lu also attended a workshop organised in the meeting hall of Circuit House in Prayagraj on Tuesday in this regard.

16-11-2021||Lucknow||Protection against Chinese manjha: View-cutters being installed on 11 flyovers of Prayagraj||After a spate of incidents where two-wheeler and bicycle riders sustained serious injuries after running into thin Chinese kite threads or manjha while crossing flyovers, as many as 11 flyovers of Prayagraj are being fitted with six-feet high ‘view cutters’ or fibre-walls.The state government has sanctioned ₹20 crore for installing view-cutters in Prayagraj as well as neighbouring Kaushambi, said officials. To note, during the past several years, many cases have been reported in Prayagraj city wherein commuters have run into Chinese thread used to fly kites. Although district police have been taking strict action against those who are indulging in the business of selling these illegal Chinese-manufactured threads and have even raided several shops in old city area, the sale of these ‘dangerous threads’ goes on unabated. It so happens that locals residing in the localities situated besides the major flyovers of the city indulge in flying kites using these Chinese threads which are quite strong and often have coatings of glass shreds that can be fatal when someone runs into them, causing serious injuries to the body part that comes in contact with the thread. Now, with the view-cutter being installed on both sides of the flyovers, the commuters will not run into this thread thereby zeroing the chances of any such incidents, officials explained. Chief engineer of UP Bridge Corporation RK Singh said “The view cutters are being installed at several of the flyovers of the city, including Rambagh flyover (which is one of the major spots where such incidents have occurred in the past), the flyover at Pani-Ki-Tanki, flyover at Chaufatka, at Alopibagh, MNNIT railway overbridge, Phulpur overbridge, Karchana overbridge, Naini overbridge, Saiyaara overbridge of Kaushambi, Sirathu overbridge in Kaushambi and the one at Manauri.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/protection-against-chinese-manjha-view-cutters-being-installed-on-11-flyovers-of-prayagraj-101637081969816.html
16-11-2021||Mumbai||NCB shielding some people in cruise drug bust case: Nawab Malik||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and state minister Nawab Malik on Tuesday shared screenshots of WhatsApp messages and audio clips purported to be between KP Gosavi, an independent witness in the cruise ship drugs bust case, and a Delhi-based unnamed informer, in a bid to show that the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) had planned to entrap guests who were scheduled to attend a party on the Cordelia cruise ship on October 2. Malik also questioned why Kashiff Khan, a Fashion TV executive was allowed to board the ship that eventually left Mumbai for Goa and returned the following night.An NCB team led by zonal director Sameer Wankhede had conducted a raid on the cruise ship, which led to eventual arrest of 20 persons, including Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son, Aryan (23), who was detained with his friends Arbaaz Merchant on October 2 before they boarded the ship.Malik said on Tuesday that while some people were caught before they boarded the ship, Kashiff Khan was given safe passage because he was allegedly close to Wankhede.Responding to Malik’s allegations, Wankhede said that he did not know Kashiff Khan and had never met him. “If Kashiff Khan is close to me, then Malik should produce some evidence, like call data record or WhatsApp chats etc,” he said. Gosavi is currently lodged in a Pune jail after he was arrested on a cheating case last month. His counsel, Sachin Kumbhar expressed his inability to comment on any NCB related matter. “I am restricted to cheating cases lodged in Pune, where the first case was registered with Faraskhana Police Station and then Lashkar Police Station took him into custody. Two more cases have been registered against him. We are looking into these cases only.”Malik alleged that the NCB picked up certain individuals from the terminal at Green Gate, where the ship was docked, by distributing their pictures to some private individuals. “Here are Whatsapp chats between K P Gosavi and an informer which shows how they were planning to trap people who were going to attend the party on the Cordelia Cruise. This is Sameer Dawood Wankhede’s private army therefore he has a lot to answer,” he said in a tweet which shared an audio recording.Malik in the past had also alleged that Wankhede had formed an “army of private individuals” that used to extort money from drug peddlers and that Gosavi was part of it. Wankhede has repeatedly refuted all allegations.According to the chats shared by Malik, in the first screenshot, the person can be seen asking Gosavi details of the people attending the cruise party along with their names and the outfits that they would be wearing. “Ok agar outfits mil jayenge to its easy to find them asap (It will become easier to find them if we could know about the outfits they are wearing)” the chat in the screenshot read. In another screenshot, the person tells Gosavi that 35 officers were waiting for his message. Gosavi purportedly responded saying that he would send an update as the boarding had been delayed by a few hours. Malik shared another screenshot of a conversation that he claimed was about Kashiff Khan. “Here is a Whatsapp chat between K P Gosavi and an informer which mentions Kashiff Khan. Why is Kashiff Khan not being questioned? What is the relationship between Kashiff Khan and Sameer Dawood Wankhede?” he asked in his tweet. “Unlike others Kashiff Khan along with a person from Dubai were allowed to board the cruise and were also given a safe passage to return. We want an answer from NCB about why they are shielding Kashiff Khan,” Malik told reporters in a press conference after he tweeted.Kashiff Khan has clarified to news channels that he has no relation with Wankhede as claimed by Malik.(With inputs from Manish Pathak and Nadeem Inamadar)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ncb-shielding-some-people-in-cruise-drug-bust-case-nawab-malik-101637079929221.html
16-11-2021||Ranchi||J’khand: CRPF jawan among 3 held for supplying ammo to Maoists||Three persons, including a CRPF jawan, were arrested by Jharkhand’s anti-terrorism squad (ATS) for allegedly supplying ammunition to outlawed CPI (Maoists) and organising criminal gangs in the state, police said on Tuesday. The three arrested persons include 29-year-old Avinash Kumar, currently posted with CRPF 18 BN stationed in Pulwama, besides his two associates, Rishi Kumar (49) and Pankaj Kumar Singh (48), police said. Prashant Anand, superintendent of police (SP), ATS, said while Avinash and Rishi were arrested from Patna and Gaya in Bihar with the help of state police, Pankaj Singh was arrested from Ranchi. Based on their information, police have recovered 450 ammunition of 5.6mm, which is used in Insas rifles. “We are verifying the source of these ammunitions, including if they have been pilfered from stock meant for any security force. Avinash had joined the CRPF in 2011 and was posted in Pulwama since 2017. However, he had been absent from duty for the past four months. We are verifying whether he has been absent due to any misconduct there,” Anand said. While all three accused belong to Bihar, Pankaj currently lives in the Bhuli area in Dhanbad. On whether they had any terror links, the officer said they are yet to establish anything on that front. “Prima facie, it appears the gang is in the trade to make quick money. They have confessed to having supplied over 1000 rounds in the past as well. They were in touch with the gangsters in jail using social media platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram,” said Anand..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/jkhand-crpf-jawan-among-3-held-for-supplying-ammo-to-maoists-101637078133841.html

Madhubani civil surgeon Dr Sunil Kumar Jha said closure notices have been served to the two nursing homes following inquiry reports, which were submitted in his office on October 30, even though prepared by district communicable disease officer on October 12. He attributed the delay on his absence on some official assignment, besides vacation on account of Diwali and Chhath festivities.The CS said a fine of ₹50, 000 has also been slapped on each of the two nursing homes, which were running without registration and necessary facilities.“So far, probe against 21 nursing homes have been conducted on the basis of two petitions filed by Avinash. Out of them, eight were already closed while inquiry reports on some others were awaited. Out of 21, only one nursing home was found to be operational in accordance with stipulated norms,” the CS said.Earlier, on November 14, Madhubani police had issued a press release about the arrest of six accused, including a woman, in the murder case. According to press release, the victim, son of Dayanand Jha, youngest among three siblings, had disappeared on November 9. His elder brother Chandra Shekhar Jha lodged an FIR at Benipatti police station on November 10. Avinash’s partially burnt body was recovered from Urain village under the same police station on November 12.Police have arrested Purnkala Devi, along with five others, identified as Roshan Kumar Sah, (23), Bittu Kumar Pandit (20), Dipak Kumar Pandit (24) and Manish Kumar (21). The press release, however, was completely silent on the “motive” behind the crime. Superintendent of police Satyaprakash did not answer calls. Later, his staff member called back saying he was “out in field” and couldn’t be contacted immediately.“My brother had filed many RTI applications against these illegal and unauthorised clinics and hospitals and healthcare establishments in his area running without licence,” said Avinash’s eldest brother Trilok Jha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/madhubani-journo-killing-two-nursing-homes-get-closure-notice-101637078132639.html
16-11-2021||Ranchi||An ocean of info with us after Maoist Kishan Da’s arrest: J’khand DGP||It would take months to study and analyse the information obtained during interrogation of dreaded Maoist Prashant Bose, Jharkhand director general of police Neeraj Sinha said on Tuesday, even as security agencies from other states also joined the questioning here. Bose alias Kishan Da was arrested last week along with his four associates from Saraikela-Kharsawan district. “The volume of information we have following his arrest is like an ocean that would take months to study and analyse. Currently, we are doing physical interrogation after taking him on remand on Monday. Officers from other states have also joined the interrogation. Once we are done with it, we plan to deploy around 100 of our men across hierarchies to study and analyse the set of information that we already have with us,” DGP Sinha said on Tuesday. However, the state police chief refused to share the source of the information they have, including those in the lone pen drive and the two SD cards they have shown in the seizure list as part of recovery from the arrested Maoist. Bose, a member of the CPI (Maoists) Politburo, his wife Sheela Marandi, herself a member of the central committee, and their four other accomplices were arrested on November 12 from Giddibera toll plaza under Kandra police station limits when they were paying toll fee for the white SUV they were travelling in as they did not have a Fastag facility. Sources said septuagenarian Bose, who now has difficulty in walking, was on his way to attend a high profile meeting of the Maoists in the forest area under Tonto police station in West Singhbhum district. A top official, who is part of the anti-Naxal operations in the state, said the arrest was done after specific inputs from the intelligence bureau (IB) about his movement from the Parasnath area in Giridih district in North Chhotanagpur to Saranda area in the Kolhan division. “A dedicated team of IB had been tracking his movement for the past 4-5 months. On November 12, his movement was being tracked from 4 am until 11 am when he was arrested. An active mobile on that vehicle helped in tracking his movement,” the officer said. With their top ideologue landing in the police net, the CPI (Maoists) has called for Bharat Bandh on November 20, besides observing “Pratirodh Diwas” from November 15 to 19. DGP Sinha said all districts have been put on high alert in wake of the call given by the Maoists. “Retaliation is not unexpected as their biggest living ideologue is in our net. We have made all preparations to meet any eventuality,” added Sinha..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/an-ocean-of-info-with-us-after-maoist-kishan-da-s-arrest-j-khand-dgp-101637078131356.html

The next day, his wife Anulika Singh, who was elected as district board member in the ongoing panchayat polls, filed an FIR (first information report) on Saturday, naming the minister, her nephew Ashish Singh alias Athiya and one Sudesh Singh as accused. The other two accused are yet to be identified. Banmankhi subdivisional police officer (SDPO) Kripa Shankar Azad, who is leading the probe, said, “We have got a CCTV footage which gives us a clear clue about the incident. We are carrying out raids not only in Purnia, but also in several districts including Araria, Katihar and Bhagalpur, to nab the accused.” Reacting to the charge, the minister said, “I am ready to face investigation. This is nothing but to malign my political image.” On the other hand, Anulika Singh has demanded a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). “The minister is quite influential and the police can’t act with honesty and integrity,” she said.Meanwhile, police have pasted notices for property attachment on the houses of the two named accused, declaring them absconders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/purnia-leader-s-killing-police-claim-key-leads-minister-denies-charge-101637078129198.html

16-11-2021||Delhi||#ShaadiSeason: Delhi to have 8000 weddings on November 21||Shaadi season in Delhi is back and how! With comparatively low number of Covid cases in the city and the guest list being capped at 200 people now, heavy saaya dates have been booked solid. While the latter part of November will see a lot of weddings in the Capital, November 21 has emerged as the day when there are nearly 8000 weddings in Delhi. “November 18-20 are totally booked for functions with the weddings being on November 21. In fact, the venues were all booked for this day since October itself,” says wedding planner Sumathy Bachchan while another wedding planner Chinmayi Jain adds, “November 21 is the most auspicious day of the year. I have five weddings booked on this day and I also have my friend’s wedding to attend in Delhi as well. So things will need to be figured out...We stopped taking more orders for that day last month itself.”Anil Thadani from Jea Band says that he has had to book more weddings than what they usually do every year. “In Delhi, there are about 7000-8000 weddings approximately on that day. Every year, even if it’s a heavy saaya day, we don’t book more than six to seven weddings, but this year we have booked 10 weddings. Some of these weddings is of people who booked with us earlier but their weddings were delayed due to Covid restrictions. People are also scared of the third wave and want to finish getting married before cases go up. Sabko abhi hi karni hai shaadi, ki third wave aa gayi toh kya karenge,” he says.Anam Zubair from WeddingWire India, a virtual marketplace that connects vendors with customers, says that booking a decent venue is becoming quite tricky. “Couples are having a hard time booking a decent venue at that date. Most of the preferable venues are already pre-booked for half or whole day. It is becoming quite challenging for vendors too because the demand is rising rapidly.Swati Chirpal, a wedding planner adds, “Hotels have divided their venues to accommodate as many weddings as they can on November 21. People are sticking to the 200-250 guest limit, but other than that, nothing has changed. People want to go all out. It’s challenging for wedding planners also as we like to be personally present at the weddings and this is why I don’t prefer taking on too many weddings on the same day. This year, we are actually having to refuse customers who want to book on November 21.”Pandits are also facing an issue in trying to divide their time on November 21. “Saaya bahut bhaari hai aur humein bhi 3-4 shaadiyon mein jaana hoga. Jinki shaadi hai, unke parivaar wale hi humein pick aur drop karenge. Aaj kal sab prefer karte hai ki shaadi jaldi ho jaye, toh uske hisaab se dekhna padhega,” says a wedding pandit, RK Pandey from Shalimar Bagh. Sushma Arora, a homemaker from Delhi says that they made sure that everything was booked well in advance for her son’s wedding on November 21. “Humne toh venue August mein ho finalise aur book kar leeya tha. Iss din saaya bhaari hai aur bahut saari shaadhiyan hai Delhi mein. Aise mein, we wanted to be very sure of getting the place we wanted,” she says.Author tweets @anjuriFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/shaadiseason-delhi-to-have-8000-weddings-on-november-21-101637077535204.html
16-11-2021||Lucknow||UP govt plans sector-wise industrialisation in 12 districts along Purvanchal Expressway||LUCKNOW With the formal opening of the 341-km-long expressway on Tuesday by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Uttar Pradesh government’s next focus would be rapid industrialisation along this expressway. The government has selected 12 districts along this expressway where region specific industries will be promoted. These units will be specific to that region/district to ensure overall development of the region, said a senior official of the state government. Barabanki, Amethi, Sultanpur, Jaunpur, Azamgarh, Ghazipur, Mau, Ayodhya, Gorakhpur, Ambedkar Nagar, Ballia and Sant Kabir Nagar districts have been identified for the Purvanchal Expressway Industrial Corridor project. The government has also decided to set up industrial parks along the expressway as part of its policy to bring up industrial parks along all e-ways. Being a land-locked state, transportation has been a major challenge for entrepreneurs investing in Uttar Pradesh. This is a major reason that the government is now preparing to develop industrial parks on the sides of expressways. “Investors have been demanding to set up industrial units along the expressways as this will provide proper connectivity to industries,” said Manmohan Agarwal, senior vice-president, Indian Industries Association (IIA).

16-11-2021||Mumbai||Pollution levels shoot up further in Mumbai, AQI at 269||A day after air pollution levels touched a season high of 245 on the air quality index (AQI), pollution levels shot up further on Tuesday, peaking at 280 in the morning, and then dropping slightly to settle at an index value of 269 by evening. An AQI of 269 falls in the “poor” category, which, as per the Central Pollution Control Board, can cause “breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure.”This is as per data from the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR) network of 10 monitoring locations across the city.Gufran Beig, meteorologist and project director, SAFAR, explained that a buildup of moisture in the city has allowed the air to retain a larger quantum of particulate matter pollutants, like PM2.5 and PM10, pushing up the AQI in almost all monitoring locations. According to IQ Air, a Swiss air quality technology and monitoring company, Mumbai’s air quality on Tuesday evening made it the seventh most polluted city across major cities globally. Delhi was the second worst, while Kolkata came in at number 10. IQ Air follows more stringent air quality guidelines laid down by the United States of America’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as per which the AQI of all three Indian cities fell in the “unhealthy” category.Experts attributed the spike in pollution — particularly particulate matter (PM) — over the past two days to an incursion of moisture after the formation of a low-pressure area in the Arabian Sea off Maharashtra’s coast. Air quality had also dipped to the “poor” category this month on November 5, a day after Diwali, when the AQI touched 215. However, the overall AQI as presented by SAFAR is an average of its city-wide network, which shows significant geographic variation.Colaba continued to register the city’s most polluted air with an AQI of 370 on Tuesday evening (up from 345 on Monday). This was in the “very poor” category, which, as per the CPCB can cause “respiratory illness on prolonged exposure.” Other locations with “very poor” air on Tuesday included Mazagaon at 331 (up from 325 on Monday) and Malad with an index value of 327 (up from 306 on Monday). “Very poor” air persisted in Bandra-Kurla Complex which recorded an AQI of 311 (314 on Monday).Only Andheri registered a significant improvement in air quality, with a "moderate” AQI of 183 (down from a “poor” reading of 259 on Monday). Meanwhile Chembur (183), Borivli (159), Worli (142), Bhandup (125) and Navi Mumbai (183) all recorded “moderate” air on Tuesday, with slight deteriorations from Monday. “Moderate” air quality can cause “breathing discomfort to people with lung disease such as asthma, and discomfort to people with heart disease, children and older adults,” as per the CPCB’s health advisory.“Because of the low-pressure area, moisture laden winds have started blowing over the city, pushing up the humidity levels. When this happens, the air becomes heavier and is able to hold pollutants, especially PM2.5 and PM10, to a greater capacity. This is why haze has accumulated over some parts of the city. Locations with higher AQI are very likely also more humid, such as in south Mumbai. At the moment, winds are not strong enough to disperse this haze but there may be some relief tomorrow due to rains,” Beig said, pointing out that parts of the South Konkan and adjacent area, including Sindhudurg, Ratnagiri coast have already begun receiving thunderstorms as of Tuesday evening.Rising humidity levels have also coincided with an uptick in temperature over the past week, with Tuesday’s daytime maximum settling at 35.7 degrees Celsius (two degrees above normal), up from 35.2 degrees Celsius a day prior. This was after maximum daytime temperature dropped to a monthly low of 32.8 degrees Celsius on November 7. Mornings in the city have also been getting warmer, with Tuesday’s minimum nighttime temperature settling at 25.4 degrees Celsius — four degrees more than normal — up from 24.4 degrees Celsius a day prior. On November 11, the minimum temperature was 19.8 degrees Celsius. Both maximum and minimum temperatures are expected to remain above normal till Friday, as per IMD’s seven-day forecast for Mumbai. “We were expecting it to rain in Mumbai on Tuesday, but the influence of the low-pressure area is being felt more in south Maharashtra. Northern Raigad, Mumbai and parts of interior Thane will get rains either Tuesday night or Wednesday. There is a likelihood of thunderstorms continuing till early Friday,” said a meteorologist with the IMD’s regional forecasting centre in Mumbai.The highest daytime maximum temperature recorded this month in Mumbai was on November 14, when the mercury touched 36.6 degrees Celsius. Last year, the highest temperature recorded in November was 36 degrees Celsius (on November 15 and 18).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pollution-levels-shoot-up-further-in-mumbai-aqi-at-269-101637074108711.html
16-11-2021||Lucknow||Previous govts reduced eastern UP to poverty, mafia rule: PM||LUCKNOW Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday accused the previous Uttar Pradesh governments of letting poverty and mafia take over the state’s eastern part, saying the BJP government was now writing a new chapter of development there.Modi was addressing a rally near Kurebhar area of Sultanpur district on Tuesday after inaugurating the 341-km Purvanchal Expressway, where he landed in a C-130J Super Hercules aircraft on a 3.2-km stretch developed as an emergency airstrip for the Indian Air Force. He also witnessed an airshow on the airstrip.The expressway links Lucknow with Ghazipur and has been constructed at an estimated cost of ₹22,500 crore. It starts from village Chaudsarai in Lucknow on Lucknow-Sultanpur road (NH-731) and ends in Hydaria village located on National Highway number 31, 18 km east of the Uttar Pradesh-Bihar border.Terming the Purvanchal expressway as a symbol of new UP and its progress, he said it would bridge the gap between the development of western and eastern UP. The PM invoked Lord Hanuman and lauded the contribution of the people of the district in the freedom struggle.“I bow to the people of the land on which Lord Hanuman killed Kalanemi. In the 1857 struggle, the people of the area fought the British. The land carries the fragrance of the independence struggle. And today, the holy land is getting the gift of Purvancahl Expressway,” he said.Development was limited to places where the previous chief ministers had their homes or families, Modi said while not naming the Samajwadi Party, the Bahujan Samaj Party or the Congress, which the ruling BJP faces in the assembly polls just months away.“The previous governments reduced the vital eastern part of the state to ‘mafiawaad’ and poverty, but the BJP government is now writing a new chapter of development,” he said. “The government, which was in power in UP before the BJP government, did not assist me. The then CM did not share dais with me fearing that his vote bank will get angry. The governments before the Yogi government were unfair to people, neglected development of the state and focused on the well being of their family. The people of UP removed them from power. They gave a big mandate to Yogi and Modi in 2017 and 2019 to serve them,” he said.“In UP, we have seen a long period of governments who showed dreams of industrialization without worrying about connectivity. As a result, many factories located here were shut due to lack of infrastructure. It was also unfortunate that both Delhi and Lucknow were dominated by the dynasts. For years, this partnership of family members kept crushing the aspirations of Uttar Pradesh,” he said.Modi emphasised that the BJP’s “double engine government” was working for the welfare of people and development of the state. “Along with running old industries, it is creating an environment for new investments,” he said. “When I laid the foundation stone of the Purvanchal Expressway three years back, I had never thought that I will land here on an aircraft one day,” added the PM. The airstrip on the highway is meant to facilitate landings and take-offs of Air Force jets during emergencies.Accusing the previous governments of “ignoring” defence infrastructure, the PM said that the country’s security was as important as its prosperity.“The emergency landing facility for aircraft on the expressway is a symbol of strength for the Indian Air Force. It’s a message to those who neglected defence infrastructure of the country,” he said.The PM said after seeing the development in UP one can say that he destiny of the state was set to change. “Who can forget regular power cuts earlier, deterioration in law and order, lack of medical facilities and loot incidents. Now, those who committed loot are in jail and new roads are being constructed across the state,” he added.“In the last seven years, villages in eastern and western UP have been connected with roads. The dream of UP’s development is being fulfilled. New medical colleges, AIIMS, modern educational institutions and airports have also been constructed,” he said.The PM said the Yogi government was working with the ‘sabka saath, sabka vikas’ mantra without any discrimination. “The industrial corridor is being developed along the expressway and 21 spots have been selected for the purpose,” he said. Lauding the Covid vaccination drive, Modi said UP had achieved the 14-crore vaccination milestone, making it the leading state in vaccination. “People ignored political misinformation and conspiracy over the Covid vaccine manufactured in the country. My government is working hard for the development of UP. Women have benefitted most under the BJP government –they have got pucca houses, power supply, cooking gas, toilets, piped drinking water supply, better health facilities under Ayushman Bharat scheme,” emphasised the PM.The event ended with an air show performed by Mirage, Jaguar, Sukhoi and An-32 aircraft, before the Prime Minister headed back to Delhi on the C-130 Hercules, which had brought him here.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/previous-govts-reduced-eastern-up-to-poverty-mafia-rule-pm-101637073688819.html

Despite the central government issuing orders restricting the weight of the bags to 50kg, the traders continue to get the mathadis to unload heavier bags.“This is exploitation of the mathadis and we will no longer tolerate it. If the situation is not corrected, tomorrow we will have mathadis from all the APMC markets converge at the APMC administrative office and take over the cabins of the officials.”APMC director and trader, Ashok Walunj, said, “We have repeatedly asked our suppliers to not send more than 50kg bags. There are just a few overweight bags that come at times and we will ensure that they too are stopped.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mathadis-protest-against-unloading-bags-heavier-than-50kg-at-apmc-market-in-navi-mumbai-101637073450054.html

Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma and his Meghalaya counterpart Conrad Sangma stated this following a joint inspection of Langpih, one of the 12 border points of contention, between both states on Tuesday. The two northeastern states are planning to address 6 of the 12 points first before moving on to the rest. Addressing a press conference in Guwahati later, the CMs stated that they have asked the three regional committees, formed to look at each of the 6 border points, to submit their reports on or before November 30 this year. Out the 12 disputed areas, the 6 which will be taken up first for resolution are Tarabari, Gizang, Hahim, Boklapara, Khanapara-Pilangkata and Ratacherra. The areas fall in Kamrup, Kamrup (Metropolitan) and Cachar districts of Assam and West Khasi Hills, Ri Bhoi and East Jaintia Hills districts of Meghalaya. “Till date, the committees formed by both states have visited 5 of the 6 disputed sites together. Today, with the consent of Meghalaya CM, we have decided that by November 30 all the three committees shall submit their reports to their respective CMs,” said Sarma. Once the reports are received, both states will consult with stakeholders one more time. After that is done, both states have agreed to issue a final statement on the 6 disputed sites most likely by December 31. Sarma mentioned that Langpih is not part of the 6 points of disputes which both states hope to resolve in the first stage. But the CMs visited the site on Tuesday to demonstrate that even in areas where the disputes are more complex there is a will by both state governments to address them. “We are trying to define which village or area in the 6 sites falls under which state. Redrawing the boundaries of both states will require the intervention of the Union home ministry and Parliament but first, we are focussing or arriving at a consensus on the boundaries. We are trying to create history,” Sangma said. Meghalaya was carved out of Assam in 1972. Over the years, differences started cropping up regarding the boundary and sometimes resulted in skirmishes between the various communities inhabiting the border areas. Both states share a 733 kilometre-long boundary. Before Tuesday, both Sarma and Sangma met twice - in July and August - this year in Shillong and Guwahati where modalities of resolving the disputes through the formation of regional committees were agreed upon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cms-of-assam-meghalaya-reiterate-commitment-to-resolve-boundary-disputes-amicably-101637072968910.html

With the divestment of Air India, this issue becomes more acute,” she wrote.Scindia, in a response to the MP on November 12, said that the government is “committed” to providing medical benefits. “I have had the matter examined. I would like to inform you that the government is fully aware and committed to providing medical facilities to the retired employees of Air India. Modalities for the same are being worked out in consultation with the ministry of health and family welfare,” Scindia responded.Reacting to the minister’s response, Chaturvedi tweeted that she was “heartened and happy to hear” from the minister that the civil aviation ministry and the health ministry are “working to resolve this.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/committed-to-providing-medical-insurance-to-retired-air-india-staffers-scindia-tells-sena-mp-101637070028556.html

Based on their information, police have recovered 450 ammunition of 5.6mm which is used in Insas rifles.“We are verifying the source of these ammunitions including if they have been pilfered from stock meant for any security force. Avinash had joined the CRPF in 2011 and was posted in Pulwama since 2017. However, he was absent from duty for the past four months. We are verifying whether he has been absent due to any misconduct there,” added Anand.While all three accused belong to Bihar, Pankaj currently lives in Bhuli area in Dhanbad. On their having any terror links, the officer said they are yet to establish anything on that front.“Prima facie it appears the gang is in the trade to make quick money. They have confessed to having supplied over 1000 rounds in the past as well. They were in touch with the gangsters who are in jail using social media platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram. We have formed an SIT led by a deputy SP to work on the case further,” said Anand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/crpf-jawan-2-others-held-in-jharkhand-for-supplying-ammunition-to-maoists-organised-gangs-101637069909380.html
16-11-2021||Chandigarh||Fighting indifference to make a difference||We waited for three days, hoping someone would take notice of the leaking tap in the playground. Its valve had become defunct and the precious liquid was flowing out incessantly. Athletes and their coaches strive hard day in and day out to make a mark in the playground of the college. The adjoining lush football ground invites an enviable footfall every morning. But somehow no one seemed to notice the 24×7 leakage of the tap in one corner of the ground. Constant wastage of water for the past few days had flooded a corner of the ground to turn it into a swamp. My friend and I are avid morning walkers. We spent the next day or two, trying to stop the flow of water by plugging the spout with twigs, tying the faulty valve with a piece of cloth and pressing the stopcock by keeping a brick over it, but to no avail. The continuous running of the tap led to waterlogging of almost one-third of the ground. Players and coaches chose to restrict their area of activity rather than spring to action to fix the defective tap. We decided to inform the security men at the gate. “Sir, do you have the required permission for morning walk in the college campus?” one of them countered. While examining our ‘morning-walk cards’, the man in-charge was ready with his next query, “Why did you enter the playground? Only players and athletes are allowed there. You come here for a walk, so stick to the pavement or road. Regarding the tap, we’ll see what needs to be done.” Dejected, we waited for two more days for remedial action but nothing happened. We decided to meet the works manager of the college. He assured us of a quick redressal but even 10 days later, nothing happened to prevent the wastage of water. Google, the panacea of all ills, was consulted to find an email ID or phone number of the college to lodge a complaint. All phone numbers on the college website were out of order. Whenever, we tried to contact the college authorities via email, all links led us to select the courses of our choice and pay the fee with a single click. One of our friends suggested to click the picture of the running water and share it on social media. His suggestion did not find favour with us. We decided to get the tap repaired instead of circulating its photo. Now, the next challenge was to bring the plumber and his tools to the ground without the security guards getting wind of our plan. A young plumber was selected and I lent him my tracksuit and sports shoes so that he could pass off as an enthusiastic jogger. It being the rainy season, I concealed the ranch, stopcock valve and thread in my folded umbrella to smuggle them to the manmade wetland. It took a few minutes to repair the faulty tap that had led to the wastage of thousands of litres of water in a fortnight. A small step in the right direction called for a treat. What better way to celebrate than eating samosas along with piping hot tea at the stall opposite the campus on a rainy morning. rajivsharma.rs201067@gmail.com The writer is an Amritsar-based freelance contributor||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/fighting-indifference-to-make-a-difference-101637069788444.html
16-11-2021||Mumbai||Sheena Bora murder case: Bombay HC rejects bail plea of Indrani Mukerjea||The Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday dismissed the bail plea of Indrani Mukerjea, who is being prosecuted for allegedly murdering her daughter Sheena Bora.A single-judge bench of justice Nitin Sambre rejected Indrani’s plea on merits. Though the special Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court – which is trying her along with her ex-husbands Peter Mukerjea and Sanjeev Khanna, and driver Shyamvar Rai for Bora’s murder – had rejected her bail applications multiple times, this was Indrani’s first attempt to seek bail from high court on merits.According to CBI, on April 24, 2012, Indrani, Khanna and Rai allegedly strangulated Sheena and later disposed of her body in a forested area near Gagode village of Raigad district.The murder came to light in August 2015 when Khar police arrested Rai, purportedly while he was attempting to dispose of an illegal firearm. After Rai revealed the murder to the police on August 25, 2015, Indrani was arrested and has since been lodged in the Byculla women’s jail. Khanna was arrested after she revealed his alleged involvement in the commission of the crime.Peter Mukerjea was arrested on November 19, 2015, after the case was transferred to CBI, which claimed that the former media baron, too, was a part of the conspiracy to eliminate Bora. Justice Sambre had granted bail to Peter Mukerjea last year on February 6.Meanwhile, the Mumbai sessions court also rejected Indrani’s anticipatory bail application in connection with a case registered by Nagpada police station for rioting inside Byculla women’s jail after the prison guards allegedly assaulted a murder accused, Manjula Shetye, to death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sheena-bora-murder-case-bombay-hc-rejects-bail-plea-of-indrani-mukerjea-101637067448359.html
16-11-2021||Chandigarh||SGPC jatha to visit Kartarpur to celebrate parkash purb||AMRITSARHailing the Centre’s decision to reopen the Kartarpur Corridor on November 17 for parkash purb of Guru Nanak, the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) on Tuesday decided to send a “jatha” to Darbar Sahib Gurdwara in Kartarpur.The “jatha”, which will pay obeisance at the gurdwara on November 19, will be led by the gurdwara body’s chief Bibi Jagir Kaur. It will also include a “ragi jatha” (group of Gurbani singers) and other members of the gurdwara body. The SGPC has also appealed to the Sikh sangat to take part in the “jatha” to celebrate Guru Nanak’s 552nd birth anniversary at Kartarpur Sahib.Earlier in the day, Union home minister Amit Shah tweeted that the corridor will be reopened from tomorrow (Wednesday), two days before the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak, saying the decision will benefit a large number of Sikh pilgrims. “I thank the Prime Minister, home minister, foreign minister and the other cabinet ministers who have taken the decision in favour of the aspirations of the Sikh sangat,” Jagir Kaur said.“As soon as we came to know about the reopening of the corridor, we requested the manager of gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib in Pakistan to start akhand paath (continual recitation of Guru Granth Sahib) from the SGPC in view of the Gurpurb,” she said.“We expect 1,500 pilgrims will be allowed to visit Kartarpur Sahib through the corridor on Gurpurb. The SGPC will expenses of Sikhs who wish to visit the historic shrine, the SGPC chief added.Kaur said another SGPC “jatha” of 855 pilgrims was scheduled to visit Nankana Sahib via the Attari-Wagah brder on November 17 to celebrate the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak. Of the 179 historic gurdwaras that came under Pakistan’s jurisdiction after Partition, only 10-12 are open for want of pilgrims, Kaur said, urging the Indian government to look into the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sgpc-jatha-to-visit-kartarpur-to-celebrate-parkash-purb-101637066488392.html
16-11-2021||Delhi||AAP accuses MCD of 'corruption'; claims BJP on its way out||Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Member of Legislature (MLA) Atishi accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ruled Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) of “corruption” by not auctioning off five prime parking locations and taking them out of the e-tender process, alleging that it will lead to the loss of funds for an already cash-starved MCD.“MCD said that we will allot these parkings to those who have been handling it till now and at a minimum price,” Atishi read off a corrigendum at the press conference on Tuesday.Atishi alleged that if the parking lots in Mansarovar Garden, Ajmal Khan Road, Karol Bagh, Shastri Park, MCD primary school Pusa Road had been auctioned MCD would have earned more than four times the 17 lakhs it is getting now by allotting it without any auction.“MCD is experiencing a shortage of funds because all three MCDS are corrupt.” Atishi claimed, adding that “This is that MCD which is unable to pay its teachers, doctors, and when they will protest MCD will say Delhi government did not pay us hence we cannot pay you”.“This is a loss for the government’s treasury, for MCD’s teachers, doctors, nurses, safai karamcharis because when MCD is unable to earn money from auctions and advertisement property tax and it goes into the pockets of BJP leaders and politicians MCD is unable to pay their salaries,” she stated.Atishi hit out at BJP for not providing any reason for taking the parking spaces out of the auction process, alleging that “because their time at MCD is about to be over and once they lose the elections next year they will not be able to continue with their practises.”Atishi also criticised the Centre for “misleading” the Supreme Court over the stubble burning issue, claiming it is the reason for the apex court questioning what the Delhi government has done to curb pollution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aap-accuses-mcd-of-corruption-claims-bjp-on-its-way-out-101637065302474.html
16-11-2021||Pune||Civic Sanskriti: Support culture of road safety in society||PUNE The World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims is observed later this week on November 21, 2021. Let’s take a moment to think about all the people who lost their lives and those seriously injured in road crashes. Today’s column is in their memory.Road traffic injuries present a colossal cost to humanity, as it is the leading cause of death among people aged 5-29 years. Children, women, the elderly, and the disabled are more likely to be pedestrians and are the most vulnerable road users.The United Nations General Assembly has proclaimed 2021-2030 as the Second Decade of Action for Road Safety with a target to reduce road traffic deaths and injuries by 50% by 2030.From victim blaming to “safe systems”Often, there is a tendency to blame the victims and drivers. In news reports of accidents, we read “a case of rash and negligent driving was registered”, or pedestrians are blamed for “crossing in the middle of traffic.”However, road safety experts for many years now have been advocating the “safe systems approach.” It advocates that safety must be at the core of road transport systems. The approach anticipates and accommodates human errors. It includes road and vehicle design to prevent death or serious injury.Those who design and maintain the roads, manufacture vehicles, enforce road safety rules and administer safety programmes share responsibility for safety with road users. Factors such as cost or the desire for faster transport should not compromise safety. In fact, lower speeds can prevent many deaths and serious injuries, especially among pedestrians, without significantly adding to travel times.To bring down road accidents in Pune, solutions need to be jointly developed and implemented by the city and transport planning agencies, road departments and highway authorities, traffic police, regional transport office (RTO), and public transport agencies.Multi-modal transportSafe public transport and safe walking and cycling are key elements of road safety within the mandate of local authorities. The road department needs to adequately provide for these modes in street design and encourage road management for the safety of all. The Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC’s) efforts to improve footpaths and the upcoming Pune Pedestrians’ Day on December 11 are noteworthy and something to look forward to.A similar focus is needed for cycle tracks. In Pune, after cycle tracks were made, we found motorised two-wheelers were using them. Bollards were added to prevent such misuse. Some of us spent several hours measuring just how wide the gap should be to allow a cyclist but prevent a scooter or motorcycle. Now, most of the cycle tracks have a forest of bollards but hardly any cyclists. The cure – if you can call it that – has proved worse than the disease, and the cycle tracks remain unusable. Perhaps it is time to accept that the design has not worked out.We will need to continue to evolve cycling infrastructure design and management. Perhaps car and bike drivers who found a new interest in cycling due to the Covid-19 lockdowns are more sensitive to cyclists’ needs now. However, a systemic solution is essential, such as better enforcement to prevent motorists’ misuse of footpaths and cycle tracks and to ensure safe crossing for pedestrians and cyclists at junctions and mid-blocks. Then perhaps one day we will feel our city is safe enough for children to walk or cycle to school.How you can helpAs a driver the best policy is to stay safe – follow traffic rules, keep safe speeds, don’t drink drive, and ensure that self and passengers wear seat belts in a car and helmets on a two-wheeler. Often if you ask back-seat passengers in cars or SUVs to put on their seat belts they say, “Oh only the driver and front passenger are required to wear.” In fact, the driver and all passengers must wear seat belts to stay safe and comply with the law.When buying a two-wheeler, you are required to be provided two helmets by the dealer, for yourself and a pillion, so make sure you get them. Helmets should fit snugly and be ISI-marked. Avoid buying a spurious or second-hand helmet especially if it is dented or cracked.If you witness a crash and people are injured, immediately contact emergency services on 108 with your mobile or land phone. If an ambulance is not available, try to take the injured persons to a hospital. One need not fear getting stuck in legal processes after helping road crash victims, as India has enacted the Good Samaritan Law in 2015. Those who help victims are not liable in legal proceedings and need not even provide their name or number as per this law.In addition, we should demand road safety. We do have a great opportunity to ask for road safety to be on the political agenda in the upcoming municipal elections. It’s up to us to support a culture of road safety and care in society and each of us has a role.Sanskriti Menon is senior programme director, Centre for Environment Education.

He stressed the importance of immediate effective, visible and measurable actions, including a dialogue with the community leadership for reassurance.The former MLC also demanded the establishment of temporary camps in the valley to ensure their stay in comparative safety. He further asked the LG for a comprehensive affordable and reassuring insurance scheme for all these employees as a compensatory safety measure besides a provision for risk allowance at the rate paid to local employees of the LIC in Kashmir valley.With regard to the removal of illegal encroachments, Raina opined, “A narrative is being pushed by vested interests to discredit the recent laudatory effort of the UT administration to remove illegal encroachments from the property of the displaced community. Illegitimate beneficiaries of these unlawful encroachments and unethical coercive sales are joining hands to blame this long due action for the unease in the valley. In this regard, “distress sale” under the Jammu and Kashmir Migrant Immovable Property (Preservation, Protection and Restraint on Distress Sales) Act, 1997 needs to be defined comprehensively to avoid arbitrary disposal of complaints. This will put to rest fake propaganda”.He demanded “a complete security audit of areas where religious minorities live in Kashmir including transit camps for PM package employees and an in-depth enquiry into coercive sales of land that originally belonged to KPs in 1990 but was taken away through manipulative sales and later resold to government at much higher rates”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjps-raina-calls-on-j-k-l-g-demands-security-audit-of-minority-pockets-101637063489725.html
16-11-2021||Mumbai||HC extends stay on construction of cycling and jogging track around Powai lake||The Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday extended its stay on the construction of a cycling and jogging track around Powai Lake, in Kurla taluka, till January 31, 2022. HC had, earlier this month, imposed a stay till November 18, in a response to public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Omkar Mahadeo Supekar and Abhishek Tripathi, PhD candidates at the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B), alleging that the work violates the Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules. On November 1, HC had restrained Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) from constructing a 10-km cycling track bordering Powai lake after it was informed that such activity would violate wetlands guidelines and rules, disrupt the natural flora and fauna associated with the lake, and have an adverse impact on the habitat of Indian marsh crocodiles (a protected species) that live there. The PIL has also stated that in 2009, the Supreme Court had passed a judgement that had stressed on safeguarding wetlands and sought directions to BMC to comply with the same. However, BMC refuted these claims and stated that Powai lake is a manmade reservoir, hence the area surrounding the lake would not come under the purview of wetland guidelines and rules. The court had asked the state to ascertain the claim of BMC and asked both the state and BMC to file their replies within a week. Neither party has yet filed their responses, and asked for additional time to comply. The BMC had previously informed the court that the project was in public interest. A division bench of the HC, led by chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Makarand S Karnik, on Tuesday directed them to do so by November 30, after which, the petitioners may submit their rejoinder by December 8. The matter will be heard next on December 13. BMC’s Projects division officials, who are privy to the development, declined to comment and said that the matter is subjudice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hc-extends-stay-on-construction-of-cycling-and-jogging-track-around-powai-lake-101637061868195.html
16-11-2021||Chandigarh||Data literacy essential for evidence-based decision-making||Data and digitisation have changed governance and even the business landscape across the globe. Technological innovations and new data methods have encouraged innovative governance practices. These are challenging the traditional rules of business and the markets substantially. Digital firms have risen to higher scales, without mass and with economies of scale and scope. There is a new wave of competition, occasionally regulated but largely unforeseen, which among other things, also has a direct impact on public sector institutions. Data means information about people, things, and systems. It is a critical input and a driver for equitable growth. It is collected differently through various sources and is affected by values, power structures, policies, and programmes of governments. Social media, call data records, geographic information system (GIS), and e-governance platforms are some of the new modes of data collection. However, governments still follow traditional methods of survey and enumeration. The data is broadly distinguished as public intent and the private intent data. Three pathways to collect data are: First or top pathway: Individuals and civil society; second or middle pathway: Government and its organisation/agencies; and third or bottom pathway: Private firms/organisations. The data collected through each of these pathways complement and supplement each other. However, each type of data has its limitations. These include lack of representativeness, granularity, accuracy, and biases such as spatial, gender, and in the Indian context, class, and caste biases. Data literacy must for digital governance For a better understanding of the new normal of digital governance and economy, data literacy is considered essential even among senior leadership in the governments and public sector institutions. It implies a greater knowledge and understanding of data acquisition, processing, analysis, visualisation, validation, and reporting that create an enabling institutional and leadership environment that places a high premium on the use of data and evidence in decision-making. It enables decision-makers to champion innovations for speedier quality growth, prepare the institutions for new statutory and non-statutory business and tax regulation, and compete in global markets. The promotion of data literacy would, however, require additional human, technological, and financial resources. Data governance, which has changed over time, includes data infrastructure policy, the legal and regulatory framework, the related economic and other policies, and institutions. These diverse elements are effectively the building blocks of a social contract that seeks to deliver the potential value of data equitably while safeguarding against harmful outcomes. It also involves laws and regulation that protect personal data and promote the open transfer of non-personal data. Data literacy is an essential aspect of data governance, and therefore its requirement would also need to be met. Challenges in harnessing social, economic value of dataThe governments and the public sector institutions face challenges in harnessing the social and economic value of data. They suffer data illiteracy even among some of their senior leadership. It was experienced during the Covid-19 pandemic. The data collection and management systems were often not fully equipped and updated according to the changing demands. The problem is, however, more intense in low and medium-income countries. The senior management and leadership of these institutions in these countries do not meet the requirements of data-driven and evidence-based decision-making. The National Statistical Organisations of these countries face substantial difficulties in data collection, access, validation, analysis, and usage due to capacity constraints. Public sector institutions mainly use public intent data. But, with the advent of new technologies and innovations, the private intent data landscape has also changed. It is big, always-on, and can be zoomed in at any time. It is also real-time, collected actively or passively, without many unknown biases, and considered a crucial input for new product design and development, cost reduction, effective intermediation, and innovations. The value of private intent data for the economy and society will be much higher if combined and repurposed along with the public intent data. It, however, does not happen too often. Again, the inadequacy or lack of data literacy among the senior leadership and management of the public sector institutions and the governments is observed as a handicap. Free flow of data for better businesses The promotion of data literacy, particularly among the senior leadership of public sector institutions, has not received the attention it requires. It is considered a low priority in low and medium-income countries. with inadequate funding for research, training, and data infrastructure. Appropriate policies and structures need to be evolved for research, training with full appreciation of the requisite financial resources. These should be done to achieve a greater understanding of new techniques and technologies of data collection, validation, and analysis. The complementarity between private intent and public intent data should also be encouraged. The values and systems that envisage the free flow of data with due safeguards for privacy should be promoted for better and competitive businesses with a greater understanding of the larger political objectives. Governments should evolve a long-term holistic plan to overcome financial, technological, and knowledge constraints in promoting data literacy and resultantly better decision-making. Such a plan should, if so required, leverage international assistance for technical assistance and training to cultivate open data practices and to build skills in the creation and dissemination of public use census, survey, and administrative datasets that are subject to international best practices in deidentification. Collaboration with private technology firms should also be explored for better results at a low cost. It has become almost essential to promote, and secure future growth with innovations. sureshkumarnangia@gmail.com The writer, a retired IAS officer, is former chief principal secretary to the Punjab chief minister.

16-11-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai’s air quality continues to worsen; in ‘poor’ category||Mumbai’s air quality worsened on Tuesday, recording an AQI of 280, according to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR). The reading officially puts the city’s air quality in the “poor” category, going by the Central Pollution Control Board’s classification.On Monday, the AQI reading was 245, also in the “poor” category. According to data from IQ Air, a Swiss air quality technology and monitoring company, Mumbai’s air was the sixth most polluted across major cities globally on Tuesday afternoon. New Delhi’s was the worst, while Kolkata was the other Indian city in the top 10, at No 8. IQ Air follows its own stringent air quality guidelines laid down by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), according to which New Delhi recorded an AQI of 235, Mumbai 166 and Kolkata 159.Experts said pollution has spiked over the past two days - particularly particulate matter (PM) pollutants - due to moisture coming in as a result of a low-pressure area in the Arabian Sea off Maharashtra’s coast. Also Read: SC: Ensure smaller cities don’t become polluted like MumbaiMumbai’s air quality had dipped to the “poor” category on November 5, a day after Diwali, when the AQI touched 215. Colaba continued to register the most polluted air in the city with an AQI of 370 - up from 345 the previous day. It was in the “very poor” category.Other locations with “very poor” air quality include Mazagaon at 331 (up from 325 on Monday) and Malad with 327 (up from 306 on Monday). “Very poor” air quality persisted in Bandra-Kurla Complex with an AQI of 311, marginally down from 314 the previous day.Gufran Beig, a meteorologist and project director at SAFAR, said a build-up of moisture in the city has allowed the air to retain more particulate matter pollutants such as PM2.5 and PM10, pushing up the AQI in almost all monitoring locations.“Due to the low-pressure area, moisture-laden winds have started blowing over the city, pushing up humidity levels. When this happens, the air becomes heavier and is able to hold pollutants, especially PM2.5 and PM10, to a greater capacity. This is why one might notice a haze accumulating over some parts of the city. At the moment, winds are not strong enough to disperse this haze, but there may be some relief soon because rains have been predicted,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbais-air-quality-continues-to-worsen-in-poor-category-101637057127772.html

In the meeting, the chief minister instructed officials on the need to have planned efforts to curb pollution. He also asked the officials to encourage locals to use public transport as much as possible, instead of private vehicles, according to the statement by the chief minister's office.The meeting comes as Delhi NCR is seeing a major dip in the air quality, prompting government to take emergency measures such as the closure of schools, construction sites. The Delhi government is also considering a lockdown of one week in order to reduce the pollutants in the air.The pollution level in the National Capital Region (NCR), especially Noida and Gurugram, recorded a slight dip on Tuesday. According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), Noida reported the Air Quality Index (AQI) in the upper end of the 'Very Poor' category at 362, while the air quality in Gurugram deteriorated to the 'Very Poor' category at 322,As per SAFAR's bulletin, the AQI in Delhi which was recorded at 331 is "unlikely to improve" today as winds at the transport level are increasing, resulting in more intrusion of farm fire-related pollutants into Delhi.Yesterday, the national capital recorded an AQI at 318 (overall).The Supreme Court on Monday directed the Central government to call an "emergency meeting" on November 16 with Punjab, Delhi, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh and sought an action plan to curb air pollution in the city.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/up-cm-adityanath-orders-officials-to-take-measures-to-curb-pollution-in-ncr-101637055338952.html

Bird flu or avian flu is an influenza that spreads among birds. In rare cases, it can affect humans. Initially, experts felt the deaths were caused by Ranikhet disease, known in the West as Newcastle disease. But a Bhopal-based lab report later confirmed that the migratory birds were dying in Rajasthan due to bird flu, officials said. Veterinary doctors and those involved in rescue operations have so far tested negative for bird flu.Authorities in the state have faced criticism over the handling of the situation, especially with the disposing of the bodies. A senior government official who wished not to be named said, “We should have waited for the lab report before acting, but the pressure was so intense to take action.”Also Read: First possible human infection of bird flu in India: What we know so farThe first death of a demoiselle crane was reported on November 5 in Kaparda village in Jodhpur, from where around 180 bodies have been recovered so far. Officials said the number of daily deaths among the migratory birds in the area have come down to four to five fatalities per day from 30-40 in the initial days of the outbreak. The outbreak hasn’t yet been recorded in the Sardar Samand Lake area in Pali district, around 36km from Kaparda. A total of 134 migratory demoiselle cranes died in the last three days, including 22 on Sunday, according to Vinod Kumar Kalra, joint director of the state’s animal husbandry department. Viscera samples of the dead birds have been sent to a lab, he said. Dr Gyan Prakash, a veterinary expert at Kaparda, said a report from a lab in Bhopal has confirmed that the birds died from avian flu, after which certain protocols were put in place, such as disinfecting the area and carefully disposing of the bodies. Prakash also said no such case has so far been reported in Khichan village, which currently has over 14,000 migratory birds. Khichan is around 180km from Jodhpur city. Prakash said that local birds were aware of Kaparda’s saline water, hence only the migratory demoiselle cranes were dying from bird flu. He said the presence of black wind stilt in the area, a bird that is seen as a pollution marker as it feeds on algae and weeds that grow in polluted water, indicated that the water in Kaparda was polluted. Prakash speculates it’s possible that the bird flu came from Japan, where an outbreak was reported in October, with migratory birds likely carrying the disease to Rajasthan. On protocols that are followed in the event of a bird flu outbreak, retired professor and microbiologist Dr AK Kataria said the process starts the moment symptoms are spotted prima facie. “Everyone, especially those involved in the process, need to be cautious when the disease is undiagnosed as it can be fatal and communicable. If it is bird flu, it can be fatal,” Dr Kataria said.In November 2019, carcasses of close to 18,000 migratory birds were found at Rajasthan’s Sambhar Lake, the largest inland salt lake in India. The deaths were caused by avian botulism, a neuromuscular illness of birds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/bird-flu-kills-300-migratory-demoiselle-cranes-in-rajasthan-in-last-10-days-101637055687865.html

16-11-2021||Delhi||High court allows eateries and bars to serve herbal hookah in Delhi||The Delhi high court on Tuesday allowed the use of herbal hookahs in the national capital subject to bars adhering to strict Covid-19 norms and using disposable pipes. The court said that when cinemas have been opened and all other activities have resumed, it would not be appropriate to keep the petitioners hanging.In an interim order, Justice Rekha Palli said in case there is any change in the Covid-19 situation, the city government can move an application to modify Tuesday’s order. Palli gave the Delhi government six weeks to file its reply.In late October, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)-led Delhi government had opposed a plea filed by various bars and restaurants seeking permission from the high court to sell and serve herbal flavoured hookahs. Citing a World Health Organisation (WHO) and Centre of Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) order, the government said allowing sale and consumption of hookah might increase the risk of Covid-19 transmission."As per WHO and CDC, the act of hookah smoking includes, touching hookah by many hands, close contact of fingers with lips which increases the possibility of transmission of the virus from hand to mouth. Thus, allowing herbal hookah in open spaces may worsen the situation and increase the transmission of COVID-19," the government had told the high court.The government also told the court that bars, restaurants and eateries do not acquire separate licences for selling herbal hookahs and classify it as “food”. Considering herbal hookah as a food product is not at all justified, the government said.Several petitions were filed by Breath Fine Lounge and Bar, TOS, R High Speedbar and Lounge, Verandah Moonshine, and Sixth Empirica Lounge in West Punjabi Bagh, challenging the order of the joint commissioner of police (licencing unit) prohibiting and excluding the sale or service of herbal flavoured hookahs in restaurant/bar being run by them.The petitioner alleged that even though herbal hookahs contained no tobacco, cops were conducting raids, seizing equipment and issuing challans. They requested the court to issue directions to both Delhi government and Delhi police not to interfere with the sale and service of herbal flavoured hookahs and not to take coercive steps against them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/high-court-allows-eateries-and-bars-to-serve-herbal-hookahs-in-delhi-101637052240631.html

Once the economy is back to normal, the health of state finances will also improve, enabling the state government to undertake development work.”Also Read: ‘He is lying, misleading public’: RJD MP slams Bihar CM over crime rate in stateN K Chowdhary, a former head of Economics at Patna University, said the government failed to cope with the second Covid-19 wave. “The public healthcare system was utterly incapable to meet the challenge.”The government also faced much embarrassment after the death of over 40 persons due to hooch.Chowdhary said they have appointed 45,000 teachers even as the process was stalled due to Panchayat polls. “For the first time... the appointments for the headmaster and headteachers for high and higher secondary education will be done through Bihar Public Service Commission (to improve quality).” Chowdhary said the women have been given 35% reservation in government jobs.Ruling Janata Dal (United) or JD (U) spokesman Neeraj Kumar said ₹4,671 crore has been sanctioned for Seven Resolves for development. “[Chief minister] Nitish Kumar has been hailed globally as a climate leader by UN body and state government has been awarded for its e-governance programme.”Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Rajiv Ranjan said the NDA has been following development with justice with the Centre’s support. “Bihar is leaping forward.”There have been signs of unease between the BJP and JD (U) over issues including caste-based enumeration and the Pegasus snooping row.Kumar led an all-party delegation that met Prime Minister Narendra Modi to push for the caste-based census. Many parties believe the reservation system is no longer representative of the demography.Much to the BJP’s embarrassment, Kumar also called for a probe into the Pegasus snooping issue.Leaders of both parties have maintained that all is well in the alliance even as Bihar water resources minister Sanjay Jha has countered the Union government’s claim that 14.6 million water connections were provided in the state under the Centre’s Jal Jeevan Mission. Jha said that 87% of rural households in the state have access to clean tap water and credited the state government for the achievement.Opposition leader Tejashi Yadav questioned what happened to the government’s promise of 1.9 million jobs? “Where is the special economic package? When will be contractual employees will be regularised. The government claims to have been providing good governance yet it has failed to build infrastructure.”Congress leader Premchandra Mishra called the NDA government’s first year dismal. “The effect of being the number three party was clearly visible on Nitish Kumar and the BJP completely dominated the government. A large number of people died due to the failure of the government on the health front and prohibition. The government lacks stability.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/nda-govt-completes-first-year-of-fourth-term-in-bihar-under-shadow-of-pandemic-101637049987363.html

Gearing up for some much-needed retail therapy, shoppers in Delhi-NCR are relieved to find Covid-19 protocols such as mandatory wearing of masks, social distancing and sanitiser machines at various points in place. “Since my childhood, IITF has been a source of joy to me as everything is beautifully decorated, and there’s amazing food. I have never missed IITF except last year due to Covid. So this year, I’m really excited to visit again. I’m looking forward to buying pashmina stoles from Jammu and Kashmir hall and beautiful sarees from Kerala hall while keeping in mind safety protocols such as double masking, social distance and sanitiser,” says Shifali Gupta, a finance associate from GTB Nagar.Organised over an area of 70,000 sqm this year, the fair has around 3,000 exhibitors from 20 states, three union territories and nine countries, including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bahrain, Kyrgyzstan, Tunisia and Turkey. Tickets are available for sale online as well as at 60 Delhi Metro stations including major ones like Mandi House, Rajiv Chowk, Hauz Khas and Kalkaji Mandir.LC Goyal, the chief managing director of the India Trade Promotion Organisation (ITPO) shares that the theme this year is Aatmanirbhar Bharat. He informs, “The fair highlights the outstanding performance of Indian entrepreneurs who have shown exemplary commitment to excel despite all odds due to the pandemic. More importantly, IITF offers an ideal platform to showcase Indian products under the Vocal for Local campaign.”For many, it is the limited number of Covid-19 cases that emboldened them to visit the fair this year. “Now that cases are fewer, we feel more confident to head out. I have always been a big fan of Delhi Trade Fair since it is here where I get chance to handpick items and relish great food from all over India,” says Niharika Gul, a Noida resident. Meanwhile, others hope that visitors will keep in mind that the pandemic is not over yet and remain careful. “If you notice, kaafi log toh markets mein bhi mask nahin pehen rahe… And lots and lots of people are going to be at the trade fair. So, everyone needs to be careful. I will definitely be going, but in double mask,” shares Manas Swaroop, a law student from Model Town.

City-based wedding choreographers are being asked to teach dance routines on songs like Woman (Doja Cat), Black & White (Diljeet Dosanjh) and Jalebi Baby (Tesher), that make for popular music audios on IG Reels. “It’s no more about photos, photo albums are passé. All the craze is on reels now,” says Sudha Khatri of photography studio Pixelstory.in, adding, “These days, clients come up with crazy requirements on deliverables. One of the common ask is how many reels will be delivered that can be instantly shared on Instagram.” Prabhu Kumar from a wedding choreography studio, More Than Thumkas, says, “With rising interest in wedding choreographies, the new trend in weddings is to include the famous Instagram reels/TikTok trends. Out of 100, at least 75 people ask for reels-inspired dance moves.” For Saloni Sharma, a city-based choreographer, lists of songs for 30-second reels have been coming in, too: “People are influenced and also want to be influencers themselves.” Anubhav, a choreographer, adds, “Reel songs like Manike Mage Hithe O Nari Manhari Sukumali are popular. People want to inculcate these dance moves.” The trend seems to have blown up so much that Meher Sarid, a Delhi-based wedding planner, says she is even looking to “hire a young person with the knowledge of making reels”.Author tweets @siddhijainnFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/grooving-to-reels-on-weddings-is-denizens-new-love-101637048727571.html

Also read: 12 firms booked for hoarding, overpricing of DAP fertiliser in PunjabThe development is seen as a setback to Chattopadhaya, considered a frontrunner for the post of Punjab DGP, the appointment of which is expected in the next few days. The camp led by Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu has been strongly backing Chattopadhyaya’s candidature for the post. It was under the Sidhu faction’s pressure that Chattopadhaya was appointed chief director, Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau, Punjab, last month. A bench headed by Justice L Nageswara Rao dismissed the appeals filed by Chattopadhyay and Mustafa. The court had reserved judgment in the case on September 15. Gupta had superseded five officers Dinkar Gupta was appointed the Punjab director general of police (DGP) in 2019. Both Mustafa, a 1985-batch IPS officer, and Chattopadhyaya, 1986-batch IPS officer, had challenged Gupta’s appointment with claims that the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) had tailor-made rules to include Gupta in the panel sent to it by it to the Punjab government. Gupta had superseded five senior officers, including Mustafa and Chattopadhyaya. After both the officers challenged the appointment in the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT), this court had quashed Gupta’a appointment. However, the Punjab and Haryana high court in January 2020 stayed the CAT orders. The UPSC is said to have taken a strong stand while backing Gupta, citing two factors, the length and range of service in the previous 10 years.

It should be clarified...How can both be correct? I urge the environment minister (Central) to verify the data,” he was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Rai's comments came a day after the Supreme Court slammed the Delhi government over its affidavit that it said was "all about bashing farmers and how the entire cause (of pollution) is stubble burning".Speaking about the meeting convened to discuss pollution in the national capital region (NCR), Rai said the Delhi government suggested a work from home policy, ban on industries and construction work to deal with the crisis.The meeting was attended by officials from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, besides all other stakeholders as directed by the Supreme Court on Monday.Meanwhile, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath held a high-level meeting on pollution earlier in the day.

16-11-2021||Delhi||New liquor vends in Delhi from tomorrow. What are the new facilities? Will alcohol cost more?||The Delhi government will exit the liquor business as nearly 600 vends run by it will be shut from Tuesday night making way for new private shops with a walk-in facility, which will begin operations from Wednesday under the new excise policy brought in to boost the city's revenue, crackdown on liquor mafia and improve user experience.The private liquor vends already shut operations on September 30 and the government-owned shops, which were operating in the transition period of one-and-a-half months, will close on Tuesday night.All the 850 liquor vends in the Capital, including the 260-odd outlets, run privately, have been given to private firms through open tender, under the new excise policy of the Delhi government implemented in June this year.Under it, retailers are free to decide the selling prices in a competitive environment, rather than an MRP mandated by the government.Also read | ‘Won’t act against pvt vendors for not paying license fee’: Delhi govt to HCThe new excise policy aims at revolutionising the consumer experience by replacing the existing liquor vends in the nooks and corners of the city, with swanky, well lit and air-conditioned liquor stores spread over at least 500 square feet area with a walk-in facility.These new liquor vends will be set up in 32 zones across the city where people would be able to walk in and buy the brand of their choice just as they do in shopping malls. They will not have iron grilles at the front which most liquor vends in the Capital had.The new liquor policy stipulates that the new liquor stores will have to be equipped with air-conditioning and CCTV cameras. It also bars selling liquor through grilled shops with people crowding outside on roads and pavements.Five super-premium retail vends having an area of 2,500 square feet can open and a liquor tasting facility will also be developed at these super-premium retail vends under the new policy.Also read | Delhi HC asks govt for details of liquor brands with fixed MRPs under new excise policyBusiness hours in the new vends in Delhi will be from 10am to 10pm and those at the airport may open round-the-clock.Officials familiar with the transition process said the availability of liquor in the city may be affected in the first few weeks and that the prices may spike a little during the initial stage.“Liquor prices may slightly start with higher rates in the initial days but, it could also be the other way round. Eventually, the prices are bound to stabilise and we can safely say that Delhi will be strongly competing with Gurugram in keeping liquor rates low and offering attractive discounts, which until now was not possible in the national capital,” a senior excise official, who asked not to be named, told Hindustan Times.The Delhi government has already issued guidelines regarding placing orders and receiving the liquor stock for the upcoming shops under the new regime. These vends have already started placing orders for procurement of liquor from November 11, officials have said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/new-liquor-vends-in-delhi-from-tomorrow-new-facilities-extended-hours-101637044494233.html

Therefore, he has a lot to answer,” Nawab Malik alleged in a tweet.Malik, Maharashtra’s minorities minister, had in the past alleged that the NCB’s Mumbai zonal director Sameer Wankhede had formed an “army of private individuals” to extort money from drug peddlers, and Gosavi was allegedly part of the network. Sameer Wankhede has refuted all the allegations made by the Maharashtra minister.According to the purported chat messages, as shared by Malik, between Gosavi and an unnamed person, a WhatsApp group was formed for communication and around 35 NCB officials were part of it. Following a spate of allegations surrounding the drugs bust case, the NCB itself formed a special investigation team (SIT) to probe the charges.

The entire process can be done online too, which is way easier and the voter ID card will be delivered at their homes. Still, for those who are uncomfortable with the online process, we will be organising special camps across all polling stations on November 27-28,” said Singh.People can get their names registered with the Delhi CEO’s office by downloading the ‘Voter Helpline app’, or going to www.nvsp.in, or by visiting the upcoming camps.The differently abled can do the same by downloading the PWD mobile app. For the homeless, the Delhi CEO organised special camps across 200 shelters on Saturday.As per the draft electoral roll, Delhi has 14,795,549 registered voters, of which 8,088,031 are male; 6,706,570 female; and 948 third gender. The total number of electors in the final electoral roll of the Delhi as on January 15, 2021 was 14,898,069, data with the CEO office showed.The special summary revision is significant because municipal elections are going to due to be held in Delhi in April next year. The final electoral roll will be published on January 5, 2022.Talking about the Covid-19 pandemic, Singh said that the 13,820 booth level officers (BLOs) appointed by him played a mjor role in Covid management.“From ensuring people follow home quarantine, to patrollig along containment zones, helping in the vaccination process and even contact tracing.

16-11-2021||Delhi||Woman, attacked by stalker with acid, succumbs||The 23-year-old woman from outer Delhi’s Bawana, who was admitted at a city hospital after her neighbour threw acid on her on November 3, succumbed to her injuries on Monday evening.Police said they will now book the arrested suspect under sections of murder.The suspect, Montu, was allegedly stalking the victim and pestering her for marriage, even though she was already married and living with her husband.On November 3, he allegedly tied up the victim’s hand before throwing acid on her when she turned down his proposal on November 3. Police had rushed the 23-year-old acid-attack survivor to the Ram Manohar Lohia hospital where she was being treated. Doctors had told the police that she had suffered around 50% burns on her face and head and that she had lost vision in both her eyes.Police had on November 8 arrested Montu,26, from Buxar, Bihar. Since over-the-counter sale of acid is banned in India, including Delhi, following the Supreme Court’s order in 2013, police interrogated Montu to know how and from where he procured it. Police had said that he had bought the acid from a man in Uttar Pradesh, by claiming to use it to clean the toilet.After his questioning, police arrested Ram Sevak, a resident of UP’s Shahjahanpur, who had sold the acid to Montu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/woman-attacked-by-stalker-with-acid-succumbs-101637012106530.html
16-11-2021||Delhi||Centre’s plea against Delhi govt’s ration plan declined||The Supreme Court on Monday declined to entertain two separate petitions against a Delhi high court interim order on September 27 that allowed the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government to stop supplying foodgrain to fixed price shops for patrons who have chosen doorstep delivery over physical collection of ration.The decision also effectively gave the go-ahead to a scheme over which the Union and Delhi governments have locked horns for over a year.The top court was considering two separate appeals, filed by the Centre and the Delhi Sarkari Ration Dealers Sangh, both aggrieved at the high court order.“We are not inclined to entertain these special leave petitions (SLP) as we are informed that the writ petition before the high court is listed on November 22, and as both parties have agreed they will not seek an adjournment,” a bench of justices L Nageswara Rao and BR Gavai said.The Centre, represented by solicitor general Tushar Mehta requested the apex court to record an undertaking from the Delhi government, that they will not implement the scheme in the meantime.To this, senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, representing the state government, said, “There is no need to pass such an order. It is impossible to roll out the scheme in such short time. The preparation and implementation of the scheme is in progress.”The bench said it will record this statement to dispose of the appeals.The ration shop owners moved the court in February challenging the tenders issued for the doorstep delivery scheme. However, the petition was amended on March 18 to challenge the Delhi government’s doorstep delivery of ration scheme, with the association demanding that it should be declared ultra vires (beyond the scope of legal power).On March 22, the court directed the Delhi government not to stop or curtail the supply of foodgrain or flour to the members of the petitioner association, for operationalising the doorstep delivery. However, the high court modified its order on September 27, allowing the government to stop supplying foodgrains to FPS to the extent of food grains for those who have chosen doorstep delivery over physical collection of ration.This was after the Delhi government informed the high court that out of 7.2 million registered ration card holders in the Capital, over 6.9 million had availed of the doorstep delivery scheme.Solicitor General Mehta on Monday argued in the Supreme Court that the delivery of foodgrain to the intended beneficiaries under the public distribution system (PDS) was envisaged only through fair price shops (FPS) as this process ensures checks against leakages through biometric authentication. “Is it open for any state to deviate from the statutorily prescribed method when the Union government has apprehensions that the foodgrains may not reach the beneficiaries,” he said, adding that this matter had “potential all-India repercussions”.He clarified that he was not arguing for the FPS owners who filed a separate appeal and had earlier petitioned the HC.Mehta argued that the scheme goes against the One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC) scheme under which the entitlement can be availed by a beneficiary and his family at two places at the same time.Singhvi rebutted Mehta’s claim, and said that Delhi government’s scheme fully complied with ONORC, and was fully computerised to enure proper delivery. He added that it was optional for the beneficiaries to collect ration from FPS on designated days. “Mandate under the NFSA is actual delivery, and if the state is ensuring it at zero cost, why should it be restricted. Unfortunately, politics is interfering in a matter of public interest. When everything is delivered at doorstep by Amazon, Flipkart, why not foodgrains?” Singhvi told the court.He pointed out that the Centre appeared through law officers in the Delhi high court and did not object to the order (September 27 verdict).The bench said that these issues were pending before the high court and asked the Centre to address its submissions there.The Delhi government’s doorstep delivery of ration scheme was to be launched on March 25, but the Union food and consumer affairs ministry wrote to the Delhi government on March 19 raising two objections — the use of the term “mukhyamantri (chief minister)” for a scheme involving the distribution of food grains allocated under the National Food Security Act (NFSA), and that any change in the delivery mechanism requires an amendment in NSFA that can be done only by Parliament. The term “mukhyamantri” was later dropped from the scheme’s name.In June, the government sent the file back to LG, contending that its provisions are in accordance with the NFS Act, and that it will simultaneously implement the Centre’s “One Nation, One Ration Card” scheme.On October 5, after the high court’s order of September 27, the government sent the file again to the LG office. In a note on the file, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said he sincerely hoped that Baijal will review his decision to stop implementation of the doorstep delivery scheme, so that the orders of the high court can be implemented and doorstep delivery of ration can be processed for the beneficiaries opting it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/centres-plea-against-delhi-govt-s-ration-plan-declined-101637011927879.html
16-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt all set to exit liquor biz, pave way for reforms||After decades of operating around 60% of the city’s retail liquor shops, the Delhi administration will formally exit from the business permanently from Tuesday night, paving the way for new privately owned shops that aim to provide a better buying experience to consumers as a new excise regime kicks in from Wednesday.Owing to the transition to the new system, under which Delhi has been divided into 32 zones, with 27 liquor shops each owned by one retail licensee per zone, the availability of liquor in the city is likely to take a hit for the first few weeks, people familiar with the transition process said. This is because the government has, so far, issued provisional licenses for retail trade of alcohol to about 350 vends, as against the 850 that are supposed to come up under the new regime.“Availability of liquor will take a hit briefly, but that is expected in such a major transition. In the wholesale market, over 200 brands have been registered, with around 10 wholesale licensees so far. These licensees have started operations with an initial procurement of 9 lakh litres of liquor of various brands. It will take about 2 months for everything to be stabilised,” a senior excise official said on condition of anonymity.A major trader in Delhi’s liquor business, who wished not to be named, said out of the 350 shops that have got the provisional license to operate, majority of them are not operational yet. “Most of them either are still getting their interiors designed, or are facing delays in terms of stock delivery. So, it will take a few weeks until the real impact of the new excise policy in terms of customer experience is visible,” he said.Meanwhile, Tuesday will be the last day for the city’s government run liquor shops.Until the new excise regime was approved earlier this year, Delhi had 849 liquor vends, of which 60% were government and 40% were private. But most of them were dogged by poor service -- personified by the famous grilles that donned most of the storefronts -- did not offer a walk-in experience, and there were allegations of brand- pushing and excise evasion by the city’s liquor mafia.The new policy aims to change all this. Under it, the new retail stores in Delhi will get rid of the iron grilles at the front of most liquor vends in the Capital, and allow buyers to browse and purchase the brands of their choice; shops will be spacious, well lit and air-conditioned to allow customers a walk-in experience under camera surveillance; and business hours will be from 10am to 10pm, while those at the airport may open round-the-clock.The office of Delhi government’s excise department was also teeming on Monday with representatives of the new licensees to get last-minute glitches addressed. Some retail licensees who have their shops ready started placing orders for liquor procurement from November 11.The excise department had kept a total reserve price for all the 32 zones at around ₹7,041 crore, and managed to earn about ₹8,917.59 crore through bidding. In addition to the bid value for the 32 zones, the excise department will also earn about ₹650 crore from excise duty, import fees, value added tax, and other licence fees, an excise official said on condition of anonymity. Another ₹900 crore to ₹1,000 crore is expected to come from licensing of new brands and distributor licenses.The average revenue of the city from the liquor business over the past three years stood at around ₹5,500 crore annually, according to government data.The new policy was implemented on June 11. Under it, retailers are free to decide the selling prices in a competitive environment, rather than an MRP mandated by the government.The prices may spike a little during the initial stage, but they will stabilise soon, said a senior excise official who asked not to be named.“Liquor prices may slightly start with higher rates in the initial days but, it could also be the other way round. Eventually, the prices are bound to stabilise and we can safely say that Delhi will be strongly competing with Gurugram in keeping liquor rates low and offering attractive discounts, which until now was not possible in the national Capital,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/govt-all-set-to-exit-liquor-biz-pave-way-for-reforms-101637011641286.html
16-11-2021||Delhi||Debate over share of farm fires in toxic air||Like a thick haze of smog that blots out visibility, mystery shrouds the exact contribution of stubble burning in worsening the air quality of Delhi-NCR.The Union government on Monday submitted before the Supreme Court that stubble burning is not a prime cause of pollution, adding that it contributes just around 10% to the total pollution. But the affidavit, placed by the Centre before the court in the same matter, also contains a finding that the stubble burning has been contributing about 35% to 40% of the total pollution load in Delhi-NCR.Interestingly the same affidavit, at another point, refers to a scientific study to maintain that stubble burning contributes a meagre 4% to PM 2.5 and PM 10 pollutants during the pre-winter and winter weeks. The source of this scientific study has not been named in the affidavit.Delhi-NCR has been in a grip of severe-plus air pollution as a toxic smog lingers over the Capital and its adjoining cities, leading to a public health emergency. This November has also seen the number of farm fires reaching a new high with the enforcement of a ban on the practice collapsing.On Saturday, the Supreme Court stepped in, imploring the Centre and the Delhi government to take “emergent measures”, including imposition of a lockdown in the national capital, to “immediately” control rising levels of air pollution.At the same time, the bench headed by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana, lamented that “bashing farmers” over stubble burning has become a fashion even though there are several other major contributors to the hazardous air quality.When Delhi government’s counsel Rahul Mehra submitted that it is “probably” the stubble burning that has made the air quality index and PM 10 and PM 2.5 pollutants shoot up by several hundred points, the bench, which also comprised justices DY Chandrachud and Surya Kant, retorted: “What is this? Now, it has become a fashion to bash farmers, whether its Delhi government or someone else. You had imposed a ban on firecrackers in Delhi. But see what has been happening in the last 7-8 days. What are you doing? What are Delhi Police doing?”When the proceedings resumed on Monday, solicitor general Tushar Mehta, representing the Centre, conceded that the court was right when it said that stubble burning is not a major contributor of air pollution. “I must admit stubble burning is not a major contributor. It contributes only 10%,” he said.This prompted the bench to observe that the “hue and cry” over farm fires apparently had no legal, scientific or rational basis. The bench also noted that the Centre’s own affidavit refers to a study to say that stubble burning contributes only 4% to increase in PM 2.5 and PM 10, and therefore, “an insignificant source of pollution” was being targeted by everyone.But the anomaly in the Union government’s response was sought to be highlighted by senior advocate Vikas Singh, who was appearing for the 17-year-old petitioner, Aditya Dubey. He contended that the Centre is trying to mislead the court by claiming stubble burning is causing less than 10% pollution. He said that the high-powered committee, comprising senior officials of the Centre and governments of Delhi, Punjab, Haryana and UP have recorded in the meeting on November 14 that stubble burning is responsible for 35%-40% of air pollution.HT has reviewed the Centre’s affidavit cited by Singh. The minutes of the meeting of the commission for air quality management in Delhi-NCR and adjoining areas, held on Sunday, records it categorically that farm fires and stubble burning partakes a major share in rising levels of pollution.“Post Diwali, there has been a spurt in the number of fire incidences owing to paddy stubble burning, particularly in Punjab where about 42,285 incidences have been reported in the last 10 days alone, out of the cumulative fire count of 62,863 till November 13 during this season. Likewise, the instances of paddy stubble burning in Haryana have also witnessed an increase compared to last year with 5,400 incidents being reported so far in 2021 against a cumulative figure of 3,635 in the corresponding period in 2020,” recorded the commission.It also made a recommendation in this regard to the state governments concerned. “Efforts need to be intensified to control the instances of stubble burning to minimum as currently the paddy stubble burning has been contributing about 35%- 40% of the total pollution load in Delhi-NCR.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/debate-over-share-of-farm-fires-in-toxic-air-101637010983780.html
16-11-2021||Delhi||Stubble fire emissions to stay low but AQI may worsen, say scientists||Air quality in Delhi will gradually deteriorate over the next 48 hours due to poor wind speed even as the contribution of farm fire emissions is expected to stay low, forecasting agencies said on Monday.
16-11-2021||Delhi||Experts say lockdown will do little to clear Delhi’s air||The Delhi government on Monday told the Supreme Court in an affidavit that it was willing to consider a lockdown in the national capital to bring down pollution levels if other NCR states agreed to do the same, but multiple experts believe such a step will achieve little in terms of controlling the bad air, cause major economic disruption, and trigger an emissions rebound once it is rolled back.The lockdown suggestion was first made on Saturday by the top court while taking stock of the Capital’s annual air emergency that has once again led to a toxic haze engulfing the city as measures by the Delhi and Union governments have once again failed to control the spike. The suggestion of locking down was in the context of Delhi alone, and the rationale behind it was that it will curb emissions from vehicles and industries, and road dust.But experts said this would only be a reactive measure that is unlikely to lead to any improvement now that the situation has turned serious. Mukesh Khare from IIT Delhi, who is also a former expert member of the now-dissolved Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control Authority), said that measures such as lockdowns, if at all, can be taken pre-emptively when there is a prediction of a drop in air quality.“We have forecasting systems which can tell when air quality will deteriorate and the concentration levels expected. Measures under Grap (Graded Response Action Plan) and a lockdown should be possibly based on that if required. It is even possible to feed data from the Covid-19 lockdown period and assess the possible reduction that could occur if a decision support system is used,” he said.Senior counsel Rahul Mehra, representing the Delhi government, told the court on Monday that a lockdown will be of little use unless it is implemented across adjoining NCR regions in UP and Haryana.Another expert called the lockdown suggestion a “knee-jerk idea” that takes away from what is needed: focussed year-long measures. “It is a knee-jerk reaction, if it occurs. Once the lockdown is lifted, those sources of pollution will return once again and you are only looking at an extreme and temporary solution. What we need is action throughout the year,” he said, asking not to be named.A third expert said warned of the costs of such measures, especially when there is little scientific evidence it will lead to any significant gains. “It will set a terrible precedent, and show that we are not able to handle the spikes in pollution at this time of the year. We also cannot judge the meteorological factors that will be at play, even if a lockdown is imposed,” said Santosh Harish, fellow at the Centre for Policy Research (CPR).Thaneshwar Adigaur, secretary of the Delhi Asangathit Nirman Mazdoor Union said that the ban on construction activity in the Capital has already led to uncertainty in the sector, and feared workers might migrate back to their villages as they had when the Covid-19 lockdown was imposed last year.Inamul Haq, a private labour contractor in Delhi, said: “Workers are worried that the ban on construction activity will be extended as the air pollution situation is unlikely to improve. In the past too, the ban has been extended. It was after great difficulty I managed to get workers back from Bihar, West Bengal etc. Now, I don’t know how long this will continue.”Haq said that if the ban is extended then he might think of sending the labourers to other cities.Traders opposed the idea of a lockdown, too, “We hope there is no lockdown now, as it will hugely impact businesses. It is only recently that the rush is back in the markets and sales have picked up. A lockdown now will break the continuity. During the pandemic, traders have suffered a lot,” said Atul Bhargava, president of the New Delhi Traders Association in Connaught Place||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/experts-say-lockdown-will-do-little-to-clear-delhi-s-air-101637010510637.html

16-11-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana | Tipper Association demands revision of sand prices||Staging a protest outside the deputy commissioner’s office, the Ludhiana Tipper Association on Monday accused the police and administration of pressuring them to sell land for ₹5 per cubic foot. They claimed that earlier they were paid ₹32 per cubic foot but the prices had been slashed. “Selling sand at the rate fixed by the government is impossible and allowance should be made for vehicle maintenance expenses, diesel charges and other miscellaneous expenses,” he said.  Leading the protest Mohd Ilyas said, “The Punjab government had recently fixed the rate of sand at ₹5.5 per cubic foot at the sand pit. However, transportation charges are additional. However, authorities and locals demand that sand should be given to them at the rate announced by the government. It is impossible for us to deliver sand at such a price.” .He added that those associated with the tipper-truck business were incurring losses and if the situation did not improve,they will have to close down their businesses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-tipper-association-demands-revision-of-sand-prices-101637009424381.html

16-11-2021||Chandigarh||Paddy arrivals continue, Punjab asks Centre to up procurement target||With paddy arrivals still continuing in Punjab even after the agencies concerned shut the procurement operations on November 10, the state government has written to the Centre to allow purchase of the grain reaching the mandis. So far, at least 188 lakh tonne produce has arrived in the grain markets and 2-3 lakh tonne more is expected. State food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu asked Union minister for food and public distribution Piyush Goyal to renew the procurement target to 191 lakh tonne. In a communication received by the state government from the Centre on August 31, the procurement of rice from Punjab was fixed at 113 lakh tonne (equivalent of 168.65 lakh tonne paddy) for the current season. “It is estimated that the total arrival of paddy this kharif season may surpass 190 lakh tonne,” said a demi-official communiqué by Ashu to the Union minister. An official in the state food and civil supplies department said, “So far, there is no reply from the Centre and we are sending another written reminder on Tuesday (through the department secretary).” On September 24, chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi had also requested Union food secretary during his visit to the state to revise the paddy procurement targets for the current season.At the start of the procurement season it was promised that the purchase of produce will continue till November 30, in line with the schedule followed by the state agencies in the past two years. Previously, the procurement that started on October 1 continued till December 15. This time, the procurement started on October 3. Due to late rainfall at the maturing stage of the crop, the harvesting was delayed and the Centre postponed the start of procurement till October 11 but it was advanced by a week after protests by farmers. At the start of the current season, procurement targets were set at 191 lakh tonne against the previous year’s all-time high procurement of 204 lakh tonne. Last year, rice of previous seasons in large volumes was brought from the outside states to be mixed with freshly shelled grain so as to make profits illegally. To check the malpractices, restrictions were imposed this time. On Sunday, 132 tonne paddy arrived in the state’s mandis, taking the total arrivals to 187.95 lakh tonne. Of the total 186.45 lakh tonne procurement so far, 167 lakh tonne has been lifted and 95,526 tonne bought by private millers. Nearly 20 lakh tonne is still lying in mandis.

The plea seeks consent of advocate general for initiation of contempt proceedings against Sidhu by high court. It alleges that Sidhu tweets about the drugs case just when it is to be taken up by high court. His act “substantially” interferes with “due course of justice” since Twitter is a public platform and he has 9.77 lakh followers. He knows his tweets are widely read and generate huge publicity, it adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/drugs-cases-contempt-petition-moved-against-sidhu-101637008403807.html

On Monday, she along with Sonu, district planning board chairman Inderjit Singh Charik and former district Congress president Babu Singh visited at least 10 villages to address gatherings in view of the upcoming assembly elections. At a press conference on Sunday, Sonu had announced that Malvika, 39, will contest the polls. But he refused to reveal the name of the party she will be joining and the seat she will contest from, while showing preference for their hometown. Moga MLA Harjot Kamal is fearing for his ticket due to Malvika’s political campaign. Sources in the district Congress unit said the defeat of the MLA’s wife in the Moga municipal corporation polls has lowered his standing within the party. His wife Rajinder Kaur was the candidate for mayoral post but lost to Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) candidate Harwinder Kaur Gill from ward number 1. Besides, Congress had won only 20 of a total of 50 wards even as 10 independent candidates joined the party later. Indirjit Singh Charik said, “Sonu and Malvika are like family to me. We are always there for each other. Besides, I had gone to villages along with Sonu and Malvika to extend my support to their mission of helping the unprivileged and the needy. These were not political events and we were there for the social cause.” Babu Singh said, “We along with Sonu Sood met people to know their problems. We all will resolve their issues. These were more of social gathering.”Talking to mediapersons, Sonu Sood said, “There are a number of people in villages, who need help, but they do not find any way. Therefore, our motive is to find those people who can take responsibility for helping people.” MLA Kamal did not respond to repeated calls and messages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/congress-leaders-by-her-side-sonu-sood-s-sister-starts-campaign-in-moga-segment-101637008163966.html
16-11-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana bus contractor issues notice to ministers, authorities over ‘illegal’ buses on city routes||With city bus services struggling to make a profit, a bus contractor has served a legal notice to the ministers concerned and local authorities for failing to tighten the noose around the transport mafia, which he claimed was plying ‘illegal’ buses on city bus routes.The notice has been served to transport minister Amrinder Singh Raja Warring, local bodies’ minister Brahm Mohindra, the state transport commissioner, Ludhiana Regional Transport Authority assistant transport officer, local bodies’ department secretary, Ludhiana municipal commissioner; commissioner of police and Ludhiana City Bus Services Limited. Accusing the ministers and local authorities of being hand in glove with the transport mafia, the contractor alleged that the authorities concerned had failed to act on his complaints, which had caused his company to incur losses. He pointed out that his agreement specifies that no private bus will be allowed to ply on city bus routes. The contractor Jaskirat Singh said no action was taken against private buses and auto rickshaws that have been plying on city bus routes, due to which the footfall in city buses had reduced. He also alleged that in July a few members of the auto-rickshaw union had also manhandled their staff in Sahnewal, but the culprits were let go scot-free. “It has come to our knowledge that the transport department is renewing the permits given to private buses to ply on city bus routes, which is against our agreement with Ludhiana City Bus service Limited. We will be left with no other option than to move court, if authorities still fail to act against the illegal buses,” said Singh.Despite attempts to reach MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal, he remained unavailable for comments. One of the officials said that a meeting had been scheduled to discuss the matter on Tuesday. At present, the city bus service is only running on two routes. Of 120 buses, 83 have been transferred to the contractor, of which, only 25 are being operated. The contractor had also moved the high court a few years ago, after the MC had served a termination notice to his company.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-bus-contractor-issues-notice-to-ministers-authorities-over-illegal-buses-on-city-routes-101637008043771.html

Addressing the devotees at Manji Sahib Diwan Hall in the Golden Temple complex in Amritsar to mark the SGPC’s 101st foundation day, Sukhbir said, “We must identify who is our own and who is not. I may have flaws. I may commit a fault or a sin, but the Akali Dal or SGPC must not be punished for that. I may be replaced as party chief tomorrow. But the institutions will be there and they are real strength of the Sikhs. They need to be defended by defeating the propaganda of the Congress”, he added.The Akali Dal and the apex gurdwara body, he said, are repositories of Sikhs’ faith and of the Punjabis’ trust in the Guru’s philosophy.“Both belong to all those who subscribe to the Panthic philosophy and Punjabi identity,” he said. Differences among Sikhs can and must be resolved within the family. Criticise me, correct me whenever you think I am wrong. But do not join the Panth’s enemies to weaken our treasured institutions,” the SAD chief said. Unfortunately, the Congress is spreading false propaganda despite their entire cabinet led by Parkash Singh Badal tendered an apology for the sacrilege incidents taking place during the SAD’s tenure in government, he said.“We tried to solve these cases, but we had to hand over the inquiry to the CBI under the circumstances. Ironically, the issue is being raised by the party that attacked the Sri Darbar Sahib with tanks and massacred thousands of our brothers and sisters,” Sukhbir said. Akal Takht acting jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh appealed to the Sikhs to unite to further strengthen the SGPC.SGPC president Jagir Kaur said preachers of different languages would be recruited and sent on tours to different states and countries for spreading Sikhism. “The Central Sikh Museum would be further expanded and the Sikh history would be portrayed in a modern way,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dont-punish-akali-dal-sgpc-for-my-faults-says-sukhbir-badal-at-golden-temple-101637007685525.html

But the decision was reversed within days, after requests by locals for reconsideration as the mela that provides employment to thousands, remained cancelled last year due to the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/fiveday-kapal-mochan-mela-begins-in-yamunanagar-101637007443762.html

16-11-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana govt to organise International Gita Mahotsav from December 2 to 19||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Haryana government has decided to organise the International Gita Mahotsav on a large scale at Kurukshetra from December 2 to 19. This was announced by the Kurukshetra deputy commissioner Mukul Kumar on Monday.Lakhs of devotees from across the country converge on to the Brahma Sarovar, where several rituals, including lighting of diyas and chanting of mantras, are carried out during the Mahotsav.Last year due to Covid 19 pandemic, the Haryana government had reduced the International Gita Mahotsav to a mere online show and the celebrations were limited to only a few programmes, such as International Gita Webinar and online Gita Path.According to the deputy commissioner, this year, the Saras Craft Mela will be organised from December 2 to 19 and the religious programmes will be organised from December 9 to 14. Online Gita Quiz will be organised from November 21 to December 8, Gita Marathon will be organised on November 28 and wall and floor painting competition will be organised on November 21 and 22. Gita seminar will be organised on December 10 and slogan chanting will be done by around 55,000 students on December 14, he added.When asked about the funds allocation for the Gita Mahotsav, Madan Mohan Chhabra, honorary secretary of the Kurukshetra Development Board said that the estimates for the expenditures are yet to be finalised.The information, provided by the Kurukshetra Development Board in a reply of an application filed by a Panipat-based advocate Amit Rathee under the RTI Act, revealed that the Bharatiya Janata Party led Haryana government had spent ₹42.16 crores in organising International Gita Mahotsav (IGM) between 2016 to 2019. The maximum ₹15.20 crores were spent in 2017, followed by ₹11.07 crores in 2018, ₹9.59 crores in 2016 and ₹6.28 core in 2019, revealed the reply.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-govt-to-organise-international-gita-mahotsav-from-december-2-to-19-101637006963679.html
16-11-2021||Chandigarh||Kashmir witnesses bumper tourist season this year||Kashmir has witnessed a good tourist season this year so far despite the Covid’s second wave hitting the country in April, May and June.Officials said over 4.25 lakh visitors toured places in the Himalayan valley till the first week of November and the outlook for winter is also bright with advance bookings in most of the hotels.October witnessed a record footfall of 91,000 – which is otherwise considered a lean month. Many people chose to celebrate their Diwali in Kashmir with 25,000 arrivals in the first week of November.“This is a bumper season as we have the highest footfall in October which is usually a lean period,” said Zeeshan Khan, assistant director tourism department, publicity.Bilal Ahmad, assistant director tourism, Pahalgam, said post-Covid, the tourism scenario this year was good.“These are lean months, but surprisingly we are getting record tourist numbers and many of them are high-end visitors,” he added. He said they have already crossed four lakh visitors till October end and the numbers are increasing. The tourism in Kashmir had nosedived after August 5, 2019, when the special status of the erstwhile state was revoked. The situation was further aggravated by the Covid-induced lockdown the next year. The ski resort of Gulmarg has also been reaping benefits this year, particularly drawing elite visitors. “Our hotels are booked. This is after 2008 that we have been seeing such inflow, particularly since last winter’s snowfall, though there was some break in May and June,” said Javid ul Rehman, assistant director tourism, Gulmarg.He said that many elite groups have been making their way to Kashmir.“There is hardly any day when the most expensive hotel in Gulmarg where a room costs 50,000 a day does not remain booked,” he said. “There can be two reasons. One is restrictions on foreign travel, so Kashmir is an option for such high-end tourists and another is many people have been holed up in their homes owing to Covid and they want to relax,” Rehman said.The footfall has buoyed the economy to some extent which has been under increased stress. Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) president Sheikh Ashiq acknowledged the positive impact of tourism revival on the economy, but wanted the government to work on making Kashmir a 12-month destination.“Definitely when there is no business and something positive happens, it helps,” Ashiq said.He said that the focus on high-end tourists is good but at the same time we want that the lower and middle segment should also be attracted.“The middle segment of tourists should not be ignored as they are a boon to the industry,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kashmir-witnesses-bumper-tourist-season-this-year-101637006847259.html

16-11-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana | Railway police to auction ‘jinxed’, seized vehicles||‘Doomed’ vehicles cursed with ‘drivers’ bad luck’, vehicles left parked in the parking zones of the Ludhiana railway station, and unclaimed stolen vehicles will soon be auctioned by the Government Railway Police.The railway police have been left with the custody of 165 unclaimed vehicles, mostly bikes and scooters, of which 110 will be auctioned, say officials.Many vehicles are those involved in a crash, but have not been claimed by the victims’ kin, fearing the vehicle to be jinxed. “We do contact the relatives of the deceased after completing legal formalities and ask them to take the vehicle with them. However, more often than not they bluntly refuse saying the vehicle may prove to be unlucky for other family members as well. We are left with no other option but to dump the vehicle at the backyard of the police station,” a GRP official said.Parking fee surpasses cost of vehicleHowever, not all vehicles to be auctioned belong to accident victims, a few also belong to those who parked their vehicles in the marked parking zones of Ludhiana railways pre-Covid, but failed to pay for the space.“People have parked their two-wheelers in these areas before the Covid lockdown. However, now that the rent of the parking has exceeded the cost of the vehicle, people have refused to claim the vehicle,” says inspector Jaskaran Singh. “We have tried to resolve such parking disputes and a few people took their vehicles back after paying concessional parking fees. However, ,many left their vehicles in the said parking areas, saying they will buy a new vehicle instead of paying the parking fee!” said Singh.Unclaimed stolen vehiclesA few vehicles were taken in custody as there were no number plates on them and they may be stolen vehicles. The GRP has now formed a committee to auction the vehicles (case properties) stranded at the GRP Police station for many years. The committee will decide the reserve price of the unclaimed vehicles.The committee includes GRP deputy superintendent of police, inspector, transport officer, manager roadways and DIC general manager. “The committee is yet to decide the date of the auction. It was supposed to be held last month, but due to a strike of the ministerial staff , the meeting of the committee was postponed. Since the strike has ended, soon proceedings will be initiated after the coordination with the DC office,” he added. The GRP will hold the auction under Section 25 of the Police Act (police- officer to take charge of unclaimed property, and be subject to magistrate’s orders as to disposal) and under Section 102 of the CRPC (any police officer, may seize any property which may be alleged or suspected to have been stolen, or which may be found under circumstances which create suspicion of the commission of any offence).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-railway-police-to-auction-jinxed-seized-vehicles-101637006244133.html
16-11-2021||Chandigarh||BJP government insensitive to plight of farmers: Mehbooba||PDP president and former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti on Monday strongly criticised the government for not being ‘sensitive’ to the plight of farmers, who recently suffered losses due to hail and snow to their paddy crops and apple produce in Jammu and Kashmir regions. She was on a visit to RS Pura and Bishnah areas to meet party workers. “Rice farmers of Jammu and those growing apple and dry fruits in Kashmir have suffered losses in recent rain, hail and snow. They are major contributors in the economy, but it seems that the administration, instead of assessing the damage on the ground, decided the compensation within four walls of their offices,” Mehbooba said. The administration, it may be stated here, has declared heavy spell of rain and snow on October 23 and 24 as ‘state-specific natural disaster’ under state disaster response fund (SDRF) norms for the purpose of providing relief to the affected farmers. Jammu, Udhampur, Kishtwar, Reasi, Samba and Kathua in Jammu division and Anantnag, Kulgam and Shopian in south Kashmir were the districts covered under the declaration. “I am told that the government assured peanuts to the farmers of RS Pura, Bishnah, Samba and other plains of Jammu as compensation, where farmers have suffered extensive damage to their standing crops,” said the former CM. “Sudden change in weather has damaged the crop of farmers and brought them to the verge of starvation but government, I am told, has fixed ₹600 compensation per kanal, which is a humiliation to the farmers,” she added. She said the BJP government has adopted a hostile attitude towards the farmers across the country and it seems Jammu and Kashmir is no different. “While they claim to provide free ration to 80 crore people of the country, they seem to miss the point that the one producing this food is the farmer of this country who has been at the receiving end of the anti-farmer policies of this government,” she said in a clear reference to the ongoing protest by the farmers against the three contentious farms laws. People of J&K will teach a lesson to BJP in next elections: GA Mir J&K Pradesh Congress Committee chief Ghulam Ahmad Mir on Monday said that people of J&K will teach BJP a lesson akin to Himachal Pradesh byelections. Addressing a rally at Nagrota in Jammu district, he said, the ruling party continue to commit atrocities on the people and all sections of society are great sufferers due to its policies. Mir said that the BJP has let loose a reign of terror from tax terrorism to all sorts of other anti-poor, anti-farmers, anti-youth and anti-trade policies besides looting the local resources after the arbitrary disbanding and downgrading of historic Dogra state of J&K. He further that the BJP was offering jobs to outsiders at the expense of local youth thereby increasing unemployment in J&K. The protest rally was part of Nationwide ‘Jan Jagran Abhiyan’ of the Congress. He said that a solitary stroke by the people in Himachal Pradesh in recent byelections forced the Modi government to scrap the prices of petrol and diesel. “People of Jammu have got only toll plazas, privatisation of power and offering of local resources and jobs to outsiders,” he said. “The people of country, especially J&K, feel cheated by the BJP and would teach a lesson to the ruling party in coming elections, as and when they are held,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bjp-government-insensitive-to-plight-of-farmers-mehbooba-101637006123656.html
16-11-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana govt claims 38% dip in farm fires, but air polluted in most cities||Even as Haryana government has been reporting a 38% dip in stubble burning cases this year, the air quality index of most cities in the state continue to remain in the ‘poor’ or ‘very poor’ category.As per the Haryana Space Application Centre’s data of the rice-residue burning events from September 15 to November 14, the state has reported 5,595 farm fires against 8,831 incidents reported during the same period last year. But the central pollution control board’s air bulletin revealed that the AQI of at least 15 cities, including Narnaul (359), Jind (350), Manesar (342), Ballabgarh (339), Bahadurgarh (332), Gurugram (332), Charkhi-Dadri (323), Sirsa (321), Faridabad (319), Rohtak (319), Dharuhera (317), Hisar (308), Fatehabad (306), Bhiwani (251) and Ambala (219), were in the ‘very poor’ category on Monday. The AQI of six other cities, namely Yamunanagar (248), Sonepat (274), Panipat (280), Kurukshetra (232), Karnal (223) and Kaithal (261) was categorised “poor” as the AQI remained between 200 and 300. As per officials from the state agriculture department, there is a difference between the number of active fire locations detected by HARSAC and the actual fire locations verified on the ground by officials after physical verification. For example in Karnal, the HARSAC has identified 897 active fire locations but officials have found only 735 incidents on ground and only 678 of them were on agricultural land. Similarly, out of 1,112 AFLs reported in Kaithal district by HARSAC, only 586 were found on the agriculture land and 526 AFLs detected by HARSAC could not be verified by the field staff.Kaithal deputy director, agriculture, Karam Chand said, “There were also problems in the locations of the stubble burning detected by the satellite. Several locations picked up in the satellite monitoring were even traced to Punjab.”Officials monitoring stubble burning said the air quality of cities like Karnal, Kaithal and Kurukshetra, where maximum cases of stubble burning were reported, was better than cities like Faridabad, Bahadurgarh, Sonipat, Charkhi-Dadri, Gurugram, Rohtak, and Hisar, where the incidents of farm fires are negligible.“Farm fires alone cannot be blamed for air pollution. There are several other factors like industrial pollution, emission from vehicles and construction activities that are equally responsible for the toxic air, especially in the NCR,” said a senior officer of the Haryana State Pollution Control Board, pleading anonymity. Haryana agriculture and farmers welfare department director general Hardeep Singh said, “No-doubt we have managed to bring the number of farm fires down this year with the help of machines, but the challenge is to bring farm fires to zero and more efforts are required so that the crop waste could be made useful.”He said there is a need to make paddy residue valuable as in areas where farmers grow basmati varieties and the crop is harvested manually, there is no problem of stubble burning as they use parali (crop waste) as cattle fodder.Ratan Mann, a farmer leader, said, “It’s easy to blame farmers for air pollution of Delhi but why is the air of Karnal and Kaithal better than the other cities despite having maximum cases of stubble burning.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-govt-claims-38-dip-in-farm-fires-but-air-polluted-in-most-cities-101637005823607.html

Further, the advertisement for the post of registrar has already lost its sanctity as it has already crossed the limit of six months and fresh applications are needed to be invited as per norms,” said Dr Malhi.President of PAU Teachers’ Association Harmeet Singh Kingra and secretary KS Sangha said that the advertisement for the post of registrar was issued on February 21 this year.

16-11-2021||Noida||SHO justifies below the knee shooting of seven accused of cow slaughter||The Ghaziabad police chief on Monday ordered a probe by a circle officer after a general diary (GD) noting from the Loni police station — made by the transferred out station house officer alleging that he was being unfairly targeted for acting against cow slaughter suspects — got leaked on social media on Sunday. Police said the inquiry was ordered after station house officer (SHO) Rajendra Kumar Tyagi made the GD entry on the night of November 13, criticising his transfer to another police station and stating that it was linked to the incident of November 11, when he and his team led a crackdown on seven cow slaughter suspects in Loni and all seven suspects sustained gunshot wounds to their legs. GD entries mainly document the daily happenings in a police station and include the arrival and departure of police officers, details of law and order, arrests and even visits of senior officers, among others. A copy of the GD is currently doing the rounds on social media and in it, Tyagi also states that the shooting of the suspects was right and senior officers should have held an inquiry before transferring him on November 13. “I was shocked when I heard of my transfer. So, I made the entry in the GD and went home instead of joining the new posting in Indirapuram. If gunshot wounds to seven suspects created any suspicion of foul play, it should have been inquired into. Had I been found erring during such an inquiry, I would have happily accepted any punishment. I have been a sharp shooter since my early days with the police and I still keep practising,” Tyagi told Hindustan Times. According to police, acting on a tipoff, they cracked down a godown in Behta Hajipur area of Loni around 6.30am on November 11 and exchanged fire with the suspects, in which all seven suspects were wounded in the leg. The police also seized seven countrymade weapons, 12 live cartridges and seven empty cartridges from the suspects, besides the seizure of several slaughtered animals. “All seven suspects fired shots at my team and we fired 16 rounds in retaliation. My actions were as per procedure but two days later, my transfer was ordered and it seems to be in connection with the crackdown incident. If such things prevail, police officers would hesitate to act against cow slaughter suspects in the future. I am shattered by the treatment meted out to me and may not resume my duty if such treatment continues,” Tyagi said. Coming to Tyagi’s aid, Loni MLA Nand Kishor Gurjar on November 14 shot off a letter to the senior superintendent of police Pawan Kumar and also marked a copy to additional chief secretary (home). “I feel that the police who countered cow slaughters should have been rewarded instead. I have come to know that there was pressure on the SHO to remove names of some people connected to the slaughtering incident. When the SHO did not budge, he was transferred,” the MLA said. Ghaziabad SSP Pawan Kumar said, “I have directed an inquiry by a circle officer in connection with the incident of leak of the contents of the GD, a government document, from the police station. Action will be taken against anyone found erring in this regard. As regards the comments made by the SHO in GD, he was transferred under a routine administrative procedure and it should not be seen in light or as an aftermath of the slaughter incident.”“If the SHO is not joining duty at Indirapuram police station, he will be termed as absent and departmental action will follow,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/sho-justifies-below-the-knee-shooting-of-seven-accused-of-cow-slaughter-101637005464848.html

Though government-operated fuel stations continued to run as usual, at private stations, commuters were seen pleading with the employees for fuel. Krishan Lal, a commuter seen standing outside a fuel station in Karnal, said, “I was not aware of the strike and I needed fuel to go to Gharaunda for a wedding.”Haryana Petroleum Dealers Welfare Association had given a 12-hour strike call from 6 am to 6pm on November 15 while the Haryana Petroleum Dealers Association said they will hold a 24-hour protest from 6 am on November 15 to 6 am on November 16.The dealers alleged that they were facing losses due to the sudden decision of the Union government to reduce central excise duty as they had to sell their fuel stock at reduced prices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/motorists-suffer-as-haryana-fuel-dealers-go-on-strike-over-slashing-of-vat-101637005406522.html
16-11-2021||Noida||UP government holds mass marriage event for over 2,300 couples in Ghaziabad||More than 2,300 couples from different communities got married in a mega mass-marriage event in Ghaziabad, organised by the Uttar Pradesh government, on Monday.Several state government ministers also attended the ceremony and blessed the newly wedded couples. Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, too, blessed the couples via video conferencing.Out of the total 2,306 couples, 812 couples from the Muslim community and six couples from the Buddhist community. The remaining couples were from the Hindu community. The couples are residents of Ghaziabad, Hapur and Bulandshahr, according to the officials.“The mass marriage event was held on the auspicious day of ‘devutthan ekdashi’ and the labour department put in a lot of efforts to make it successful. Daughters are above caste, beliefs and religion... They are daughters to everyone. There’s a saying -- ‘Gaon Ki Beti, Sab Ki Beti’... You should remember that mass marriage events could not take place here before 2017, as the state administration did not make arrangements for it,” CM Adityanath said on Monday.“Someone who has experienced the pain and suffering of the poor will be able to help them out. Such events create social participation... the entire society attends such events. Relatives of many such women stay away from them so that they don’t have to help them, especially financially... Now, our ministers and officers help to organise such mass marriage events. When such marriage events are arranged, it shows that the common people are getting the true benefits of independence,” he said, adding that “such initiatives also lessen/defeat societal evils like dowry and child marriage”.The labour department in Gautam Budh Nagar took the initiative to help unmarried women among the registered labourers, according to its officials.The family of a woman also gets ₹75,000 under such arrangements, and ₹55,000 if her family gets her married, said officials of the district labour department.“Apart from this, we also made arrangements for huge pandals, and lunch for all guests. We also roped in band parties so that the couples get the real feel of the usual wedding ceremonies. Couples with different religious beliefs were married according to their respective rituals on Monday. Ministers and other eminent persons also attended the event and blessed the couples. There was a huge participation, and the guests said that they enjoyed the event,” said Ravi Srivastava, labour commissioner, Gautam Budh Nagar.Officials familiar with the development said that “there were rumours that Muslim couples, too, will get married as per Hindu rituals during the mass marriage event on Monday”, however, the situation was tackled by making the people aware that wedding of couples from different religions will be held as per their practices only.Danish Saifi from Dasna, one of the bridegrooms, said, “Marriage of all the couples was performed as per their religious beliefs only, and they were happy with the arrangements. Such events should be encouraged so that there is no financial burden on the family of the woman,” Saifi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/up-government-holds-mass-marriage-event-for-over-2-300-couples-in-ghaziabad-101637005405165.html
16-11-2021||Chandigarh||Sans fire brigade, Doraha perched on powder keg||A major fire incident at an automobile factory near Doraha on November 11 has yet again brought the many inadequacies in the city’s fire safety under the spotlight. For starters, the city, which has a population of 35,000, does not have its own fire brigade and depends on the fire services of surrounding cities such as Samrala, Khanna and Ludhiana. This allows the flames time to spread and increases the scope of tragedy as the fire stations of Samrala, Khanna and Ludhiana are located at a distance of 17km, 23km and 21km from Doraha, respectively. It takes at least 20 minutes for the fire brigades to reach Doraha in case of an emergency. Though a fire tender borrowed from the Samrala fire station has been stationed at Doraha for around one year, the fire fighters lack modern equipment and the foam solution required to douse fires caused due to chemicals. Fuel galore for flames Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) Ward 14 councillor Sarabjit Singh (Vipan) Sethi said, “We have raised this issue time and time again! The fire tender from Samrala was also stationed here after the residents raised a hue and cry over lack of fire safety. Incidentally, Lakkar Mandi, the wood market, is also situated in Doraha and on an average at least two fire incidents are reported from the area every fortnight.” There are around 40 industrial units in and around Doraha. “Authorities have failed to setup a fire brigade despite the presence of industrial units in and around Doraha. Fatal fire accidents have taken place here in the past,” said former municipal council president Rajvir Singh Rubal, who is also the president of the All-India Trade Union in Doraha. Industrialists in Jaspalon village, around 5 -6km from Doraha, have also raised a demand to set up a fire brigade in the area. Knitwear and Textile Club president Vinod Thapar says, “A few years back, a fire had ravaged a garment factory in the area. The common facility centre (CFC) of the apparel and knitwear industry, Integrated Apparel Technology and Facilitation Centre Private Limited, has been established in the village at a cost of ₹15 crore and a few national and internal brand companies are also situated in the area. Thus, a fire brigade is sorely needed.” ‘Proposal pending with govt’Several attempts were made to reach Doraha municipal council president Sudarshan Sharma, but to no avail. However, the council’s executive officer Sukhdev Singh said the council had approved a resolution to establish a fire station in the city, but the proposal is pending with the state government. Doraha, Sahnewal and a few other areas contribute to running the fire brigade in Samrala. Payal MLA Lakhvir Singh Lakha said, “A fire station is needed in Doraha and I have taken up the matter in the Vidhan Sabha as well. A fire tender from Samrala was stationed in Doraha only after I raised my voice. I will take up the matter with the government again.” Fire tragedies Previous tragedies have failed to impress the necessity of a fire brigade in Doraha on the administration. On June 2015, five people were killed and over 140 were injured in an ammonia gas leak after a gas tanker was stuck under the Doraha flyover on National Highway-44 and gas leaked in the area.A young couple was killed due to suspected asphyxia after fire broke out at a beer bar-cum-restaurant in Doraha on October 2018. At that time too, fire tenders were rushed from Khanna, Ludhiana, and Samrala to douse the flames and dilute the ammonia gas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sans-fire-brigade-doraha-perched-on-powder-keg-101637005404020.html

16-11-2021||Noida||CPCB focuses on monitoring stations seeing above-average spike as pollution dips||Pollution levels in Ghaziabad, Greater Noida, and Noida witnessed a minor spike from Sunday to Monday, but remained in the “very poor” category on both days. However, statistics from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) revealed that monitoring stations in Loni, Ghaziabad, and Sector 116, Noida, recorded higher levels of pollution as compared to other monitoring stations in both cities on Monday.According to CPCB, Ghaziabad, Greater Noida, and Noida recorded Air Quality Index (AQI) readings of 331, 310 and 321, respectively on Sunday, and 335, 317 and 338, respectively on Monday.The CPCB’s statistics indicated that the monitoring station at Loni recorded exceptionally high Air Quality Index (AQI) readings -- from 403 to 433 -- between 10am and 4pm on Monday.Likewise, the monitoring station at Sector 116, Noida, recorded AQI levels between 363 and 373 during the same period on Monday.An AQI reading between 101 and 200 is considered moderate, between 201 and 300 is considered poor, between 301 and 400 is considered very poor, and above 400 is considered severe.Officials of the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) said that they will try to investigate the reasons for the spike at the two monitoring stations and will take corrective measures.“A team has been sent to Loni to find out the reasons. The readings of the station at Loni were higher than the average of other stations. There are multiple factors in Loni which affect local conditions. We have already asked the officials at Loni to increase water sprinkling and road sweeping,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB, Ghaziabad.“We inspected the monitoring station at Sector 116, but we could not find any local source that triggered the station’s AQI to higher levels compared to those of other stations in Noida. It could be due to some local conditions, but we are keeping a watch,” said Praveen Kumar, regional officer of UPPCB, Noida.“Once the overall pollution levels come down in the NCR, the situation demands strict enforcement by local agencies as local factors then come into play. If there is a spike in pollution levels at random monitoring stations, it means that local sources could be responsible,” said Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist.The CPCB’s winter inspections -- “assessment of actions taken by implementing agencies” -- that are taking place between October 20 and November 10, have identified 22 polluted areas and sources that require attention so far.In Ghaziabad, CPCB states that factors such as industrial emissions, unpaved roads, open dumping of garbage, open/garbage burning, and unpaved roads/pits require attention, while in Noida, sources such as road dust, construction, and demolition activities, open dumping of garbage and unpaved roads require attention.In Greater Noida, factors such as road dust, traffic congestion, and industrial emission require attention, according to CPCB.Monday’s forecast by the System of air quality and weather forecasting and research (Safar) stated that NCR’s average AQI was in the “very poor” category and unlikely to improve on Tuesday as winds were transporting more farm fire-related pollutants into Delhi.“Calm local winds also reduce the dispersion of pollutants. So, the air quality is expected to remain in the higher end of the ‘very poor’ category tomorrow [Tuesday]. The effective farm fire count is 3,125 and its contribution to Delhi’s PM2.5 today [Monday] is 10%... Surface winds are slowing down further on [November] 17th and 18th reducing dispersion. Overall the AQI is expected to be in the ‘very poor’ category range for the next 3 days,” the Safar forecast on Monday said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/cpcb-focuses-on-monitoring-stations-seeing-above-average-spike-as-pollution-dips-101637004747806.html
16-11-2021||Noida||Greater Noida authority floats ₹121 crore tender for waste management in city||The Greater Noida authority has decided to spend ₹121 crore on a project, for initiating a system for door-to-door waste collection across the city and transport the same at the landfill site for treatment, officials said on Monday.The move has been taken with an aim to collect waste from urban and rural areas for a cleaner city, they added.At present, the Greater Noida authority depends on ragpickers for door-to-door waste collection, and dumping the same outside the respective sectors without proper segregation, said the officials.The authority on Monday floated the key tender, inviting companies for solid waste management across the city, who will take up the job and develop an integrated mechanism for waste handling according to the Solid Waste Management Rules 2016. Interested companies can apply for the same through portal greaternoidaauthority.in by November 22 this year.“Once the companies submit their proposals, we will finalise the agency, following the laid down rules,” said Narendra Bhooshan, chief executive officer of the Greater Noida authority.The authority will hire the agency for 10 years and develop a system under which the waste will be collected from door-to-door, and stored at a specific collection point. Then, the agency will ensure that the waste is transported from the collection point to the landfill site in Lakhnawali village in Greater Noida for treatment.The agency will also develop an integrated control room from where they will monitor the workers and the vehicles through GPS, for better productivity, said the authority officials.There are 124 villages and 50 residential sectors in Greater Noida which are spread across 38,000 hectares. However, the authority is yet to develop a proper system to handle around 300 metric tonnes of waste produced in the city daily. The authority hopes that once the agency will be selected, waste handling is likely to get better in Greater Noida.The Greater Noida authority hopes to select the agency for the purpose by December-end if everything goes according to the plan, and the agency selected starts working at the ground from next year, said the officials.Meanwhile, residents said that the authority officials have been discussing developing a systematic plan for waste collection in the city for many years, but nothing has happened yet.“The authority has failed in developing a proper mechanism for waste collection and treatment till date. It had issued similar tenders in the past, too. We hope that they finally select an agency this time, which will start working without any further delay,” said Om Raizada, a social activist from Sector P3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/greater-noida-authority-floats-121-crore-tender-for-waste-management-in-city-101637004746494.html

16-11-2021||Noida||23 out of total 29 coronavirus patients in Gautam Budh Nagar fully vaccinated||Officials of the district health department said on Monday that 23 out of the total 29 Covid-19 patients in Gautam Budh Nagar -- as of Sunday (November 14) -- are fully vaccinated.Of the 29 active cases, 26 are in home isolation and three -- among the fully vaccinated ones -- are being treated at a private hospital in Noida, they said. Out of the remaining unvaccinated individuals, two are children -- on whom the vaccination status is not applicable. Of the total 29 Covid-19 patients, 15 have a travel history to other cities and states including Delhi, Haryana (Gurugram), Chennai, Kolkata and Mumbai.“Over 80% of the fully vaccinated individuals, who have been infected with Covid-19, are immunocompromised patients above the age of 40-45 years. Three patients, who are undergoing treatment at the hospital, are senior citizens,” said a health department official, requesting anonymity.Of the total cases, two children and 10 adults tested positive following a routine RT-PCR test which they needed for travelling out of station, he added. Following this development, Dr Sunil Kumar Sharma, chief medical officer (CMO), Gautam Budh Nagar, said, “Complete vaccination does not guarantee that the person will not get infected with Covid-19 again. However, it does help in lowering the severity of the disease and chances of death. Most of the patients have comorbidities, and the rate of infection is higher among them, even after double vaccination”.Dr Ishwar Gilada, secretary general of Organised Medicine Academic Guild (OMAG), said that breakthrough infection -- people getting infected with Covid-19 two weeks after vaccination -- is not a major cause of concern. “None of the vaccines promise 100% protection against Covid-19. Both the vaccines in India have shown a 70-80% efficacy against the virus. In fact, Covaxin and Covishield have also shown a 70-80% efficacy against the delta variant of the coronavirus. Apart from this, the vaccines provide a 93-94% protection from hospitalisation and a 98% protection from death,” said the infectious diseases expert (IDE).“The breakthrough infections we are seeing now mean that they are in the remaining 20-30% category of efficiency of the vaccines. Since most of these patients are mildly symptomatic, and the rate of death is minimal, this is not a cause of concern,” Dr Gilada added.At 29, Gautam Budh Nagar has the highest number of active Covid-19 cases in Uttar Pradesh as of Sunday. So far, the district has reported 63,366 cases, of which, 62,894 have recovered. The death toll stands at 467.“There are a lot of migrants in Gautam Budh Nagar, and many people travel across the district during the festive season. This may have led to the increase in the Covid-19 infections. However, it is too soon to say that there is a rising trend of Covid-19 cases as the situation will only be clear in the next one week, as cases may go down again,” said Dr Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/23-out-of-total-29-coronavirus-patients-in-gautam-budh-nagar-fully-vaccinated-101637004743623.html

The registration number/mark for BH-series vehicles generated randomly through the portal after verification of working certification will be in black on a white background and ‘shall’ be exhibited in the format YY BH #### XX format, where YY will be the year of first registration followed by BH code for Bharat series.The new facility, Sahu clarified, was available voluntarily and was not compulsory. Under Section 47 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, a person is allowed to keep the vehicle for not more than 12 months in any state other than the state where the vehicle is registered. A new registration with the new state’s registering authority has to be made within the stipulated time of 12 months after taking NOC from the state where the vehicle was registered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uttar-pradesh-starts-bharat-series-for-seamless-transfer-of-vehicles-across-states-101637004623514.html

16-11-2021||Gurugram||Four booked for assaulting garbage collectors who asked them to segregate waste in Gurugram||Police on Sunday booked four men for allegedly assaulting two employees of Ecogreen Energy, the concessionaire engaged by Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) for waste management, after they refused to pick mixed waste. Police said incidents of residents assaulting employees after being asked to segregate waste have been reported from at least three residential areas in the past week . According to the police, Anil Kumar (30), the driver of the garbage collection vehicle and his helper Shadat Khan went to Shivaji Nagar on Sunday morning to collect garbage. Kumar was collecting the waste when he noticed that residents had not segregated the garbage and were giving them the bag of the mixed waste, which he objected to. “When I refused to collect the garbage, one of the residents called his friends and forced me to pick up the garbage. I told them that I cannot pick up mixed waste and will only collect it when they segregate it. They started abusing and assaulting me,” he said. Kumar said Khan rushed to help him and started making videos for evidence, following which the men assaulted him too and threatened them. Police said four men snatched away their belongings, including a gold ring, and threatened them against visiting their lane ever again. The MCG, since November 11, collects only segregated waste from households and has directed its drivers and concessionaire not to pick up mixed waste. The civic body said it will start penalising residents who dump accumulated mixed waste in public spaces. In the last week of October, the MCG issued directions to its sanitation wing and officials of Ecogreen Energy to make citizens aware of the segregation process. The segregation of waste is also aimed at converting wet waste into compost and recycling dry waste to the maximum possible extent so that the load carried to the overburdened Bandhwari landfill can be reduced. Suvendu Samantaray, general manager, operations of Ecogreen, said that as per the guidelines of MCG’s solid waste management, since Sunday they have started a 100% waste segregation campaign across the city. “To enforce this MCG professed that no mixed waste should be collected from any residential area and awareness campaigns have been launched. Our team members are often attacked when they do not collect mixed waste and threatened for life,” he said. Both employees are undergoing treatment at a private hospital and reported out of danger, said police. Samantaray said that they have given a copy of the mobile phone recording where the suspects are seen assaulting both the employees. Parveen Kumar, station house officer of Shivaji Nagar police station, said that incidents of assaulting the employees of waste management company has increased. “Residents do not want to segregate waste and when the employees ask them they get agitated and attack them. We have booked four of the suspects but yet to arrest them,” he said. A case under sections 323 (assault), 506 (threatening for life), and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code at Shivaji Nagar police station on Sunday evening. The suspects were identified as Monu, Ankit , Sanjay, and Neeraj of Shivaji Nagar. They are on the run, said police. Hari Om Atri, joint commissioner of MCG, said that they have directly the drivers to only collect segregated waste and not to pick mixed waste. “Such incidents have increased across the city and we are taking strict action against the offenders. We are receiving complaints from Palam Vihar, Sector 10 and Sector,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/four-booked-for-assaulting-garbage-collectors-who-asked-them-to-segregate-waste-in-gurugram-101637004443519.html
16-11-2021||Gurugram||Air quality dips again, deteriorates to very poor zone in Gurugram||After improving for a day, Gurugram’s air quality again dipped to the “very poor” zone, according to Central Pollution Control Board’s classification on Monday. The city reported an Air Quality Index (AQI) reading of 332 with Particulate Matter (PM)2.5 as the prominent pollutant. On Sunday, Gurugram had reported an AQI reading of 287. An AQI reading between 101 and 200 is considered “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”. According to the weather bulletin issued by the Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi-NCR on Monday evening, the air quality is likely to deteriorate marginally but remain in the “very poor” category on Tuesday and Wednesday. Over the next five days, the air quality is likely to remain in the upper end of “very poor” category in this region with PM2.5 as the predominant pollutant. PM 2.5 is fine, inhalable particulate matter with diameters of 2.5 microns. PM 2.5 pollutants are made up of hundreds of chemicals that can enter the bloodstream via the respiratory system and cause asthma, lung cancer, and heart disease.Over the next two days, the ventilation index — a measure of air pollution based on the speed of the wind and the height of the column of air in which smoke or other pollutants mix — in Delhi-NCR will be 3,000 m2/s on Tuesday and 1,500 m2/s on Wednesday. Experts say a ventilation index lower than 6,000 m2/s, along with an average wind speed less than 10kmph, is unfavourable for the dispersion of pollutants. The weather bulletin also mentioned that on Sunday, Haryana reported 195 farm fires.In the past few days, Delhi-NCR witnessed “severe” air quality due to which on Sunday, the Haryana government ordered that all schools will be shut in four districts — Gurugram, Faridabad, Sonipat and Jhajjar —till November 17. The Delhi government too, on Saturday, announced the closure of all educational institutions for a week, and imposed a four-day ban on construction activities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/air-quality-dips-again-deteriorates-to-very-poor-zone-in-gurugram-101637004210071.html

16-11-2021||Gurugram||Over 100 new monitors across Gurugram by January for localised monitoring of air quality||In the next two months, Gurugram will get over 100 new low-cost monitors for air quality and weather parameters, said officials of Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority on Monday. These monitors will be installed on the terrace of a community centre in every sector to monitor levels of PM 2.5, PM 10 (particulate matter, which experts consider primary pollutants in Delhi-NCR), noise pollution, wind speed and direction, among others. “We will expand the number of air quality monitors in Gurugram and are aiming to install one such monitor in every sector in association with the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram by January. These monitors will be installed at community centres in every sector,” said Subhash Yadav, head of the urban environment division, GMDA. “These structures will monitor air and noise pollution levels along with weather parameters such as rainfall, wind velocity, temperature, wind direction and humidity. These monitors will directly transmit the data to the Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) of GMDA and we will know which area has more of air pollution or noise pollution,” he said. He added that these monitors will help in localised monitoring of pollution levels, according to which measures to curb pollution can be implemented. Gurugram has 115 sectors as well as separate colonies, such as Shivaji Nagar, Civil Lines, Chandan Vihar, Palam Vihar. Yadav said that these monitors will be in addition to five low-cost air quality monitors that are likely to be set up in the city as part of the second phase of Project Air Care. As part of Project Air Care, GMDA is working on installing real-time air quality display monitors at nine locations in the city where outdoor air purifiers are already installed. The city at present has 24 air quality monitors, which include four air quality monitors of the Central Pollution Control Board and low-cost monitors installed by GMDA. In January 2020, GMDA installed 20 of its own low-cost monitors, procured through Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds, for realtime monitoring and localised remedial action. These monitors are installed at Vatika Chowk, Bakhtawar Chowk, Sector 32, Mayfield Garden, Tau Devi Lal Biodiversity Park, Sector 42, Sector 47, Sector 30, Sohna Chowk, Ghoda Chowk, Sector 14, Atul Kataria Chowk, Sector 18, Rezang La Chowk, Atlas Chowk, Shyam Chowk, Shankar Chowk, Belvedere Tower Metro station, TERI Golf Course at Bandhwari, and TERI retreat centre at Bandhwari. Air quality experts in the city welcomed the decision and said that this will help monitor local sources of pollution better. Sachin Panwar, a city-based independent air quality scientist, said, “If the implementation is done properly then this will give us more data and help in tracking local sources of pollution. At present, if there is a fire due to any reason, it does not always gets noticed as there may or may not be an air quality monitor near the location. This is a good move, but will help only if it is implemented properly and on time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/over-100-new-monitors-across-gurugram-by-january-for-localised-monitoring-of-air-quality-101637004023431.html

16-11-2021||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh excise department launches drive against restaurants serving liquor without license||The excise department has ordered a drive across the state to check if restaurants and marriage halls were serving liquor to customers without having a regular bar license or an occasional liquor license. “In such cases, where liquor is found being served without obtaining the license, the department would initiate strict action,” additional chief secretary excise Sanjay R Bhoosreddy and excise commissioner Senthil R Pandian said on Monday. To make it clear that this wasn’t an empty threat, Pandian mentioned a case in Noida, where a restaurant owner was booked, and the manager of the restaurant arrested after seizure of 17 bottles of foreign liquor, including a few open ones, 56 beer cans and bottles from the restaurant. “Two persons, including manager Gaurav Pandey and Pranay Manral were arrested on the spot. Cases against six others, including Rajendra Singh, Kehar Singh, restaurant owner Yogesh Sharma and Sunil Kumar were registered in the police station, Phase 3, Gautam Buddha Nagar,” Pandian was quoted as saying in a press release issued by the excise department. The excise department release also revealed the identity of the restaurant stating that it was the ‘Flying Dutchman Restaurant’ against which the action was initiated. When contacted, an outlet in Noida with the same name as mentioned in the excise department’s release, refused that any action was taken against them. “We have a proper liquor license. The action must have been taken against some other (outlet),” staff from the Noida based outlet said. Despite several attempts to find the outlet, against whom the action was initiated for their version, HT couldn’t contact the restaurant. Pay ₹12k to stock liquor at home The state government has also made the license mandatory for stocking liquor, above a certain quantity, at home. In March, months after the state cabinet approved the new excise policy, making license mandatory for stocking of liquor at home, the excise department issued notification setting limits for the same. A personal home license has been made mandatory for stocking liquor at home, and the annual fee of the license would be ₹12000 with a security deposit of ₹51000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uttar-pradesh-excise-department-launches-drive-against-restaurants-serving-liquor-without-license-101637003546469.html

16-11-2021||Pune||How Purandare’s ‘Jaanta Raja’ took Chhatrapati Shivaji to every household in the state||PUNE In seven decades of his work, Babasaheb Purandare (99), produced many books and delivered hundreds of lectures. However, he is best known for his book Raja Shiv Chhatrapati and the popular play, Jaanta Raja. The two are considered masterpieces on the life and times of the 17th century Maratha king, Shivaji Maharaj. While his book has more than 16 editions and is estimated to have sold 500,000 copies, the play, first staged in 1985, has been performed 850 times over the last three decades. Through ‘Jaanta Raja’ is performed by over 300 artistes, Purandare took the “open theatre” show to almost every town in Maharashtra, besides organising performances in various parts of India and the USA. The mahanatya (mega-play) was one of a kind, with its massive production values. “To read history and understand it is sometimes a complex task. However, Purandare through his lucid writing, made it readable to everyone,” said Mandar Lawate, a historian. According to Vishwas Patil, author and retired IAS officer, Purandare received a boost to bring Shivaji to the masses when Sumitra Raje Bhosale from the Royal family in Satara invited him for his first lecture. “His greatest contribution was that in a stretch of 10 days, he could deliver the entire story of Shivaji Maharaj. This was an achievement in modern times where he delivered long lectures and captured the imagination of the people for last 60 years. Babasaheb was a great orator with an excellent command over Marathi and his style was lucid, thus making his lectures a great contribution to literature.” Whenever Jaanta Raja was being staged, young and old thronged in large numbers with most shows booked in advance. There were elephants and horses in the play that made it blockbuster worthy. Divakar Pandey has worked with Babasaheb for 56 years. This play with more than 300 local actors and use of animals, brought the historical figure to life. “No one has been able to compose a play till date in the manner in which Babasaheb Purandare did it, with the help of hundreds of actors and living animals. Babasaheb created a magnificent play, even though the journey very difficult,” said Pandey.The play was a challenge from logistical point as shifting large number of animals and artistes was next to impossible. So Purandare often preferred local artistes wherever he went to stage the play. According to Pandey, Purandare wanted to produce a magnificent play on Shivaji and found inspiration in England while watching plays there. This inspired him to write Jaanta Raja in 1978. Milind Joshi, president, Maharashtra Sahitya Parisad said, “Earlier, history was regarded as a subject of researchers, but Babasaheb showed us that even the common man could understand the greatness of Raja Shivaji, through the use of the folk-tale style of telling a story. In fact Acharya Atre had written about Babasaheb’s work in his editorial in Maratha, stating that one could sense poets like Kalidas and prose like that of Shakespeare in Babasaheb’s works.” Babasaheb continued to hold lecture series on Shiv Charitra even at the age of 75 year. Doctor has to step in and tell him not to speak for more than two hours. At the same time, Raja Shivchhatrapati, Purandare’s hugely popular two-part book on Shivaji, written in Marathi, was first published in the late 1950s and has since been a staple in Marathi households, going through numerous reprints over the decades. When Purandare turned 99 in July this year, senior historian Gajanan Mehendale said, “Babasaheb has the credit of taking the life of Chhatrapati to every household in Maharashtra. He also carries the great legacy of the Bharat Itihas Sanshodhak Mandal. Sadanand More, author and critic who once headed the Philosophy department at the Savitribai Phule Pune University said, “Purandare’s work was immensely read and well appreciated. He was a Historian who used literary language to bring Chhatrapati Shivaj’s life to people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/how-purandare-s-jaanta-raja-took-chhatrapati-shivaji-to-every-household-in-the-state-101637003304193.html

Two members of the family were killed on the night of the attack and an injured member died during treatment on November 7. The death toll of the attack is now four, said police. On the night of November 4, two men were killed and four others, including Balram Singh (40) and his eight-year-old son, were severely injured when a group of men allegedly barged into their house and fired at least 30 rounds at them. Locals from Kasan village and Balram’s family members protested outside a private hospital in Sector 38 on Monday and refused to collect his remains, demanding the arrest of the main suspect, who is allegedly on the run. Senior police officers assured them they would do their best, following which they allowed officials to conduct an autopsy on the body. Police said Balram suffered one gunshot wound.The November 4 attack was a fallout between two gangs that has been going on for over a decade, the police said. According to the survivors and area residents, the firing went on for around 10 minutes, following which the attackers fled when the police were called. The police booked 10 persons, eight of whom were arrested, but the main suspect is still at large. Yashwant Yadav, the station house officer of IMT Manesar police station, said, “Balram was battling for his life at a private hospital and died due to excessive bleeding,” he said. Dr Yudhvir Singh Antil, the forensic expert who conducted the autopsy, confirmed that he died due to excessive bleeding. “The bullet was found inside his kidney and he had not gained consciousness since he was shot at,” he said.Yadav said two other victims, including the eight-year-old boy, were still recovering, and the family’s pet dog, which was also shot, is reported to be stable. According to the police, the incident took place at the residence of a former sarpanch (village head), identified as Gopal, around 8pm, when his extended family was visiting them for drinks and dinner on the occasion of Diwali.SHO Yadav said that the two groups were allies in criminal activities before their relations soured in 2007, when Gopal’s sons, Balram and Sohanpal, allegedly murdered one Manoj, the brother of Yogender alias Rinku, the leader of the other group.“A tiff broke out between the two groups leading to the murder of Manoj in 2007, done in order to establish supremacy in the area. Balram and Sohanpal were out on bail. The main suspect was holding a grudge against them for his brother’s murder and planned to kill all the family members when they were together on Diwali night,” the SHO said.According to Rajesh Kumar, one of the injured victims, the attack was carried out by Rinku, Deepak alias Bholu of Aligarh in Uttar Pradesh, Manish Rana of Bhiwani, and Amit alias Gaath of Sonipat, along with others. “We were sitting inside the room when the incident took place. My nephews Balram and Sohanpal were chatting with their cousin Praveen, while his son Vikas Raghav, and Balram’s eight-year-old son were celebrating Diwali on the lawn when we were fired upon,” he said.The men who died on Diwali night were identified as Vikas (21) and Sohanpal (35), while Balram was injured and died on Monday. The others who were injured were Kumar, Parveen and Balram’s eight-year-old son.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/fallout-of-manesar-gang-rivalry-diwali-attack-s-death-toll-rises-to-four-101637003063837.html

16-11-2021||Pune||Why Babasaheb’s dream project - Shivsrushti - must be completed||PUNE: The real tribute to late Babasaheb Purandare would be to complete his dream project, Shivsrushti, which remains unfinished due to financial problems, historian Pandurang Balkawde has said.“To create Shivsrushti was late Babasaheb Purandare’s biggest dream which remains incomplete. The Shivsrushti is located at Ambegaon; some works have been completed while many others remain incomplete due to financial problems,” Balkawde said.Late Babasaheb Purandare used the income received from the sale of tickets of his mega play, “Janta Raja” to create Shivsrushti where both scholars and commoners would get all the information about Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and the Maratha Empire. He purchased 27 acre land at Ambegaon through the Maharaja Shivchhatrapati Pratishthan under the Shiv Sena government led by the then chief minister Manohar Joshi.“Babasaheb spent Rs25 crore from his own pocket (sale of tickets of ‘Janta Raja’) on the project. However, a lot more money was required and Babasaheb tried to raise it. The Rashtriya Swayam Sevak Sangh (RSS) generated around Rs50 crore for the project. Even the state government promised some money but handed over to him Rs5 crore under the then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis,” Balkawde said.“Around Rs80 crore has already been spent on the project but if we want to pay real tribute to Babasaheb, we need to complete this project which will be a world attraction in future,” Balkawde added.The then BJP government under chief minister Devendra Fadnavis granted “mega project” status to Shivsrushti which created controversy at the time as there were two Shivsrushtis planned in the city – one by Babasaheb’s trust and the other by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC).What is Shivsrushti?Late Babasaheb Purandare travelled all over the world and saw various memorials and parks following which he questioned why there was no such memorial dedicated to Shivaji Maharaj, where citizens would get all the information about the Maratha warrior-king and his various pursuits. It was a dream and Babasaheb began pursuing it, starting with the purchase of land at Ambegaon and meetings with various historians, architects and people from all walks of life.Today, the Sarkarwada building has been completed and even the replica of the Bhavani Mata temple located at Pratapgad is near complete. Babasaheb wanted to display how Shivaji Maharaj fought, which is why one tank was proposed within the memorial. He wanted the library located within the memorial premises to house all the books on Shivaji Maharaj so that citizens and students could refer to them whenever needed. He planned to erect a replica of Raigad hall (darbar) where Shivaji Maharaj pronounced his accession as Maharaj.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/why-babasaheb-s-dream-project-shivsrushti-must-be-completed-101637002825946.html

Pooja was arrested after being discharged from the hospital where she was admitted for wrist wounds. “Initial investigation has revealed that the woman was short-tempered and often got angry over trivial things. The child, Kanishka, was crying continuously and did not stop despite her mother’s best efforts to calm her down. In a fit of rage, Pooja allegedly strangled the child to death,” said Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police, Gurugram.Pooja in her statement to the police said she had no intention of killing her daughter and was only trying to scold the child after grabbing her by the neck. But the child died and once she realised what had happened, the guilt drove her to slit her wrist, said police, quoting Pooja’s statement.Sangwan said the husband is employed with a leading automobile company in the city and was at work at the time of the incident. “Singh left for work around 1.45pm Sunday, leaving Pooja and Kanishka at home. Around midnight, he returned home to find the house locked from inside. When his repeated knocks went unanswered, he banged on the door multiple times till it finally broke open,” Sangwan said.“He went inside and found his wife lying on the floor in a pool of blood. She was bleeding from her wrist wounds, but was breathing. Singh then saw his daughter on the bed, lifeless,” Sangwan said, quoting Singh’s statement to the police.Singh told the police that he was in a state of panic when he called the police control room and one of his relatives who live in the same locality.“We took Pooja and Kanishka to a government hospital in Sector 10 where the doctor declared Kanishka brought dead while Pooja was admitted for treatment,” said Singh.A doctor, requesting anonymity, said the woman had a sharp cut with a kitchen knife to her wrists. “The cut was not deep enough to be fatal. She is stable and fit now,” the doctor said.Based on Singh’s complaint, a case was registered against Pooja under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code at the Sector 10 police station on Sunday. Sangwan said a probe is still underway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-mom-strangles-three-year-old-girl-to-death-in-a-fit-of-rage-arrested-101637002823490.html

16-11-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Village residents in Ward 8 feel neglected||Ward No. 8 comprises four villages — Mauli Jagran, Raipur Kalan, Raipur Khurd and Makhan Majra — that have recently come under the Chandigarh municipal corporation’s jurisdiction and will be voting for a councillor for the first time next month. A general ward, it is especially important to Member of Parliament Kirron Kher, who had adopted Makhan Majra and Raipur Kalan villages under the Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana in 2014. However, residents rue that this hasn’t changed their fortunes.Moreover, locals feel that they have been neglected ever since the panchayati system was done away with and the villages came under the MC in 2018.Tarsem Singh Tiwana, who resides in Mauli Jagran (also called Moli Pind), says: “What was the point of bringing the villages under the MC if for three years we would have no public representation? Earlier, the panches were approachable and used to help us, but now the MC officials treat us indifferently.”There is an open drain that passes through the area, leading to a health hazard, especially during monsoons. Harbhajan Singh, a former zila parishad member, says: “The drain originates at Gobindpura in Manimajra and has been covered there, but has been left open here. It is a breeding site for disease-spreading mosquitoes.” In Raipur Kalan, one of two villages adopted by the MP, the streets wear a cleaner look and shopkeepers along the main road confirm that the MC staff visits the village regularly to collect waste. However, not all residents are happy. Gurdeep Singh, a local, says: “The village has no cut for vehicles on the main road and we have to drive on the wrong side to enter it, leading to a lot of hassle.”The situation is worse at the other adopted village, Makhan Majra, where residents allege that the MP hasn’t turned up since 2014. Prem Kaur, who has been living in the village for the past 40 years, says: “The MP has ignored us. The taxes have increased so much since the village was taken over by the MC that many traders have shut their shops.” At Raipur Khurd, former sarpanch Lachman Singh rues about how the status of the village has fallen ever since the panchayati system was abolished. “For three years, nobody from the MC enquired about us and we were left to fend for ourselves. Now that the MC elections are coming close, they are engaging in theatrics, putting a new water pipeline here and cleaning the streets. It remains to be seen if they can maintain this momentum after the elections.”Throwing light on the lal dora extension issue, local Congress leader Jeet Singh says: “In Raipur Khurd, around 60% of the village lies outside the lal dora. People living here can’t get a water or electricity connection. The next councillor must ensure that these people don’t suffer.”Know your wardLocalities: Mauli Jagran, Raipur Kalan, Makhan Majra and Raipur KhurdGeneral ward (taking part in MC polls for first time)Voters: 12,000 Key issuesIgnored by MC officials, residents want to go back to panchayati system Open drain passing through area a health hazard, especially during monsoons Garbage dumped on streets, not being picked by MC vehiclesLocal voicesThe area needs a sports facility for youngsters.

16-11-2021||Pune||Kids’ growth in Pune continues to decline in past five years||Pune: The central government has found that Pune district has shown negative growth in all the four indicators of child growth including stunting, wasting, severe wasting and underweight since the past five years. As of recent data, Pune has reported 32.7% of kids are underweight, 30.7% stunting, 31.4% wasting and 14% severe wasting among those who were tested and reported to have a poor growth rate. Officials blame it on the rapid urbanisation of the district and the government machinery’s inability to reach out the ever-migrating population of kids who travel to the city along with the workforce. As per the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) data conducted within the past five years between 2015-16 and 2019-20, the district’s health indicators with regards to kids aged less than 5 has gone from bad to worse. However, the district administration has said that this is possibly because of the rampant urbanisation that the district saw in the last five years. In terms of stunting the difference rose to 8.3% more kids reporting the same, for wasting this went to 8%, severe wasting went to 5% and the number of underweight kids rose by 7.1%. All the four indicators worsened in the past five years and so the administration has taken multiple steps to ensure that the number of health kids goes higher. Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer, Pune zilla parishad said, “It is true that we have reported a slip which not just includes the rural areas but also the urban areas in the district. The primary reason for this is the urbanisation seen in the district which is why the district saw a surge in migration and we have reported more malnourished kids among the labour workforce like construction labours, sugarcane cutters, factory workers and other migratory workers. We do not find malnourishment among the kids from the tribal belt. The reason for this slip could be the fact that the government machinery lacked in reaching out to this migratory force which we are working up on now.” Prasad said that the administration has taken several exhaustive steps which have also resulted in decrease in the number of malnourished kids in the district. He said, “We have got all the kids in rural areas checked for malnourishment through doctors a campaign which was launched in February 2020 and we categorised the necessary interventions into three groups like nutritional, medical and surgical. The results are evident now as in the first year, 2020, we saw a drop of malnourishment among kids by 44% which has now gone to 80%. It is also noteworthy that the child and maternal mortality rate in the district has also gone down significantly because of the interventions we have put into place.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/kids-growth-in-pune-continues-to-decline-in-past-five-years-101637002043489.html
16-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi pollution: Air quality may deteriorate over next 48 hours||New Delhi: Air quality in Delhi will gradually deteriorate over the next 48 hours due to poor wind speed even as the contribution of farm fire emissions is expected to stay low, forecasting agencies said on Monday. Delhi’s average air quality index (AQI) was recorded at 353 (very poor) on Monday, maginally poor from 330 on Sunday. However, it may shift towards the higher end of the very poor range (up to 400), forecasters said. They added that farm fires contributed 10% of the particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) pollutants to the capital’s air. According to the Early Warning System for Delhi (EWS), a forecasting system developed under the ministry of earth sciences, wind is likely to blow at 4-8 km/hr in the early morning hours on Tuesday and Wednesday. Gufran Beig, founder and project director at the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), said while calm wind conditions were impacting Delhi negatively, the share of stubble burning could reduce further from Tuesday, with wind direction expected to change to easterly. “This will reduce the impact of stubble burning further, even as pollutants accumulate locally. This may push air quality to the higher end of very poor, but it is unlikely to touch severe,” said Beig. Data from the Decision Support System (DSS) --- a new source-wise forecasting tool launched by the ministry of earth sciences this year -- shows that the contribution of vehicles is expected to remain highest among local sources of pollution in the next two days, hovering between 20 and 25%. This is followed by around 7-8% contribution from industries in Delhi and NCR. The share of stubble burning could meanwhile drop to around 6% in the next two days, the data shows. Another factor negatively impacting Delhi’s air at the moment is a drop in temperature. While Delhi recorded the season’s lowest minimum temperature of 10.1 degrees Celsius on Sunday, it was recorded at 10.3 degrees Celsius on Monday. IMD has forecast that it may drop to 9 degrees by Wednesday. Senior IMD scientist RK Jenamani said visibility dropped slightly on Monday, and the relative humidity went up by 10-15%. “Visibility was between 1,000 and 1,500 metres at Palam on Monday as compared to 1,500 to 2,200 metres on Sunday. Similiarly at Safdarjung, it was between 800 and 1,200 metres as compared to 1,000-1,500 metres on Sunday. Relative humidity has increased, with shallow fog expected on Tuesday,” he said. Dipankar Saha, former head of CPCB’s air laboratory, says even with a reduction in stubble emissions, pollutants in Delhi had become trapped. “An accumulation is taking place, which will only go away if wind speeds pick up,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-pollution-air-quality-may-deteriorate-over-next-48-hours-101637001924517.html
16-11-2021||Delhi||Nudged by SC, Delhi govt plans steps to maximise use of public buses, Metro||After the Supreme Court pulled up the Delhi government for making ‘lame excuses’ and passing the buck instead of taking emergent measures to control air pollution, the state government on Monday prepared a fresh proposal for the state disaster management authority to relax the Covid-19 norms and allow standing passengers in buses and the Delhi Metro, senior officials privy to the development said. The state transport department also wrote to the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC), Delhi Integrated Multi-modal Transit System (DIMTS) and the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) to utilise their bus and Metro fleet to full capacity to reduce private vehicles on city roads.According to the affidavit submitted by the Centre before the SC on Monday, 28% of the city’s PM 2.5 levels during winters is contributed by the transport sector in Delhi. The same for PM 10 is around 24% during the winter months. Delhi has more than 10 million registered vehicles and lakhs of hundreds of thousands more enter or cross the national Capital every day.On Monday, hours after the apex court reproached the Delhi government for mostly blaming stubble burning for the city’s hazardous air quality, environment minister Gopal Rai convened a meeting of all transport agencies to explore ways to increase the availability of public transport in the city. Besides, the additional chief secretary (environment) also held an inter-departmental meeting to discuss actions taken by all concerned Delhi government agencies and seek suggestions from them.“Timing is an important factor when looking at the contribution of stubble burning to Delhi’s air pollution. We do not know which period the data on stubble burning was considered by the Centre in its report that it submitted to the SC today (Monday). In October, the contribution of stubble burning was low because it rained. Central government’s own agency Safar has said in the past few days that the contribution of stubble burning to the city’s poor air quality was as high as 48% at one point. We do not know on what basis the Centre is quoting its numbers,” Rai said.The Delhi environment minister insisted that a joint action plan involving all the neighbouring states and the Centre was required to fight pollution in the city. “In Delhi, all our commercial vehicles run on CNG and we have one of the highest number of electric vehicles among Indian cities. But then, lakhs of diesel vehicles enter Delhi every day which also spikes pollution in the city. That is why a joint action plan is required. We are ready to cooperate with every stakeholder,” he said.The Supreme Court on Monday asked the Centre and state government to focus on city related issues such as dust, industry and vehicular emissions. When the Delhi government’s counsel Rahul Mehra said road sweeping was handled by the municipal corporations, the top court shot back, “You’ are passing the buck to MCD again. This kind of lame excuse will compel us to find out and hold an audit inquiry into the total revenue you are collecting and spending on popularity slogans instead of looking after people.”Delhi transport commissioner Ashish Kundra said he has written to the DMRC, the DTC and the DIMTS to utilise their bus and Metro fleet to their full capacity. “All buses will be run every day and no buses will be kept on reserve until at least Wednesday (November 17). The Delhi Metro is also working on increasing their trains,” he said.According to the Central Pollution Control Board data, Delhi has seen one of the second most polluted ten days after Diwali since 2015, when AQI record keeping began. The data shows that the city saw seven severe days (of the total 11) this year, compared to the worst so far in 2016 when the capital witnessed the air quality in the severe zone for 10 days.A senior government official said the Delhi government is also sending a fresh proposal to the DDMA to allow standing passengers in the metro and the state-run buses. Almost 50% of the ridership in both these modes of public transport is being killed at present due to the DDMA’s existing Covid-19 norm which states that the Metro and buses are allowed to operate only with 100% of their seating capacity.When allowed to operate to its full capacity, including standing passengers, the DTC and cluster buses together carry about 4.2 million people every day, while the Delhi metro carries about 2.3 million passengers. Delhi currently has a bus fleet of a total of over 6,700 DTC and cluster buses.Kundra said the government will also intensify its crackdown against end of life vehicles by roping in the municipal corporations and the police. Registered diesel vehicles more than 10 years old, and any vehicle over 15 years old, cannot operate in NCR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/nudged-by-sc-delhi-govt-plans-steps-to-maximise-use-of-public-buses-metro-101637001923364.html

Our alliance leaders are regularly raising burning issues like inflation, unemployment among others. Huge crowd emerges in every programme of the SP and the Morcha. The growing support to the alliance is giving sleepless night to the ruling party,” said Rajbhar while addressing a mahapanchayat organised by Bhagidari Party (P), an ally of Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha, in Varanasi on Monday. Rajbhar said, the public has made up its mind and departure of the BJP is certain in 2022. “I along with my party workers will participate in the SP’s rally in Ghazipur on November 16, to garner support for the alliance,” asserted Rabhar. SBSP-led Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha recently formed an alliance with Samajwadi Party. ‘Morcha will make Akhilesh next UP CM’ SBSP chief Omprapkash Rajbhar said the alliance has taken a resolution to make SP chief Akhilesh Yadav chief minister of UP in 2022. The morcha will put all its strength to realise its goal. “Inflation and unemployment are at peak. Common man is upset with the inflation, but the government at the Centre and the state led by the BJP are not taking any step to control it. Besides, the BJP government is not listening to the farmers,” Rajbhar alleged. Bhagidari Party president further said that the Morcha would uproot the BJP government in the state in 2022. SBSP state unit vice president Shashipratap Singh said, “The upcoming assembly elections in UP are very crucial. The Morcha will emerge as a strong force and will play important role in formation of next government in UP.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/varanasi-bjp-upset-with-sbsp-sp-poll-alliance-says-rajbhar-101637001863515.html
16-11-2021||Lucknow||Lucknow DM makes it mandatory for hospitals to treat Zika patients||The Lucknow district administration has made it mandatory for all hospitals in the state capital to treat those infected with the Zika virus. “No hospital can deny treatment to a Zika patient. The hospital will admit and treat the patient,” the Lucknow district magistrate’s office confirmed after a meeting chaired by the district magistrate Abhishek Prakash on Monday. Till now 399 samples from suspected cases have been tested in laboratory and three tested positive for zika in Lucknow.“If a person from Lalkuan, Husainganj or Kanpur Road, from where three cases have been reported, goes for blood donation or for consultation at hospital, they shall be screened for any symptoms on priority,” the DM asked the health officials at a meeting.“Also, samples from all fever cases getting admitted to hospitals should be tested for Zika and hospitals should prepare a ward for patients reporting illness from mosquito bite. If there is no separate ward then mosquito net should be used for each patient,” he said.It was also decided that fever clinics that were previously running for covid cases shall be started again. “The integrated covid command centres shall monitor fever cases and also ensure there is no panic regarding Zika and Dengue. Hospitals will put up dos and don’ts regarding Dengue and Zika prominently,” he said.“Prevention for both Zika and Dengue is the same. Avoid mosquito bite and remove stagnated water. Using a mosquito net at home is the ultimate protection against mosquito bite,” said Dr Abhishek Shukla, secretary general association of international doctors.The health teams visited 3299 houses in different areas on Monday to check sources of mosquito breeding and served notices to 7 house owners where stagnated water was spotted.Also, health teams collected 33 samples from among 5196 people screened in Safdalbagh, 43 samples from among 3779 people in Phoolbagh and 7 samples in Sambhalkheda from among 4205 people screened during the day. Zika cases have been reported from these areas. In all 69 samples taken from people in close contacts of the three cases in these three areas tested negative for Zika. Samples were taken two days before.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lucknow-dm-makes-it-mandatory-for-hospitals-to-treat-zika-patients-101637001803239.html
16-11-2021||Delhi||Water storage units common breeding spots, says South Delhi civic body||As Delhi faces a sharp spike in dengue cases this year, an analysis by the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) has found that water storage units and peridomestic containers constitute the biggest share of mosquito breeding spots in the city.The analysis, conducted by SDMC’s anti-malaria operations headquarter and the public health department and based on mosquito breeding site data from 32 hot spot wards, chalks out the current distribution of mosquito breeding sites and its variation.According to it, 58.5% aedes aegypti larvae were found in water storage units, such as drums, buckets, jerry cans etc; 30.2% in peri-domestic units, like money plant vases, flower pots, water feeders for birds etc; and smaller contributions from overhead tanks (5.4%), desert coolers (3.8%) and sumps (2.1%).A senior SDMC public health official said that the top category of breeding sites shows an overlap of vulnerable spots in areas lacking basic infrastructure.“Households using containers for water storage have maximum breeding sites. There is also carelessness among the residents leading to breeding in such decorative items such as flower pots and fountains. Aedes aegypti is a mosquito that can spread dengue fever, chikungunya and yellow fever. It prefers to lay eggs in clean water and has adapted to breed among human dwellings. With the drop in temperature, we are likely see a further decrease in dengue cases but people need to be extra vigilant for these two weeks,” official said.Inderjeet Sehrawat, leader of the house in SDMC, said that the delayed monsoon and slow arrival of winter has led to increase in the dengue cases this year. “The situation will improve once temperature dips below 10°C. Meanwhile, we will continue a three-day intensive drive in areas with high frequency of dengue cases,” he added.The domestic breeding checkers of the three civic bodies have so far detected 1.80 lakh houses with mosquito breeding in 2021, which is higher than the 1.07 lakh detected in 2020 and 1.73 lakh in 2019.The weekly vector-borne diseases report released on Monday shows that mosquito breeding was found in 5,111 houses in the last week.Within the three civic bodies, North MCD areas have witnessed maximum cases of mosquito breeding, followed by SDMC and EDMC respectively.A public health official overseeing the entomological survey of the 32 vulnerable wards explained that the areas were assessed on mosquito surveillance indices -- house index (HI), container index (CI), and breteau index (number of positive containers per 100 houses) -- to measure the density of aedes mosquito larvae.Some of the problem areas highlighted in the survey include Gautam Nagar, G-2 Block Sangam Vihar, Tigri Colony, Mehrauli ward 8, Jeevan Park Uttam Nagar, F-Block Raj Nagar-2, Mahipalpur Village Harijan Basti, Rangpuri Pahari’s Inder Camp, Khadda colony and Chhuriya Mohalla of Tehkhand Village.“The distribution can be used to assess other vulnerable areas too,” the official remarked.A senior municipal entomologist said that with the temperature dropping below 15°C, residents should be extra cautious as adult aedes aegypti mosquitoes migrate from open areas, which are colder, to optimum temperature conditions within houses around evenings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-dengue-cases-water-storage-units-common-breeding-sites-101637001683684.html
16-11-2021||Delhi||Dengue cases cross 5,000 mark, Delhi’s highest since 2015 outbreak||The number of dengue cases in Delhi almost doubled to 5,277 as the city added 2,569 new cases of the mosquito-borne infection during the week ending on November 13, according to the weekly report released by the municipal corporations of Delhi.This is the highest number of dengue cases recorded in the Capital since its largest ever dengue outbreak in 2015 when nearly 16,000 people were affected and 60 died.“Of the total number of cases reported this week, 25-30% of the cases are from the last two months and are only now being reported by healthcare facilities. There has been an increase in reporting since the disease was made notifiable,” said a senior official from the corporation health department.The Delhi government made dengue a ‘notifiable disease’ in mid-October, along with other vector-borne diseases like malaria and chikungunya, under the epidemic diseases act.Another official from the Delhi government’s health department concurred, but added a note of caution: “There has been a change in the reporting process this year to strengthen the system. It stands to reason that more cases will be reported this year; the data cannot be compared to previous years.”Delhi reported 4,431 cases in 2016 and 4,726 cases in 2017, before it dropped sharply to 2,798 cases in 2018, 2,036 cases in 2019, and 1,072 infections in 2020.Delhi has reported nine deaths due to the infection so far, nearing the 2017 toll of 10. There were four deaths reported in 2018, two in 2019, and one in 2020.A doctor from a tertiary care hospital, on the condition of anonymity, said that the actual number of cases – those diagnosed by a test – are likely to be four times the current figure.“It is good that the previous numbers are now being added, but there are still many cases that are going unreported,” the doctor said.The report shows that the number of cases reported in November also continues to be high, despite a decline in temperatures. Usually, the highest number of cases in a year is reported in October.Discounting the 25% additional reporting this week due to the notification, over 3,000 cases were still reported in Delhi in November, higher than the 1,196 cases in October. Even during the 2015 outbreak, 7,283 cases were reported in the month of October, in comparison to just 841 cases in November.“This year, rains were erratic and continued till late; the temperature didn’t dip much either. This is the reason we are still seeing dengue cases. The mosquito breeding is likely to go down in another week and then the cases will reduce in the subsequent 15 to 20 days,” said the municipal health official quoted above.The municipal corporations are responsible for breeding control measures.A senior official from Lok Nayak hospital also said that the 100-bed ward at the hospital continues to be 80 to 90% full at all time.“We are reporting a high number of dengue cases in the hospital; unfortunately many cases are coming in late and then it is difficult to save them. People must visit a doctor if they experience any abdominal symptoms like pain, nausea, and vomiting,” said the tertiary care hospital doctor quoted above.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dengue-cases-cross-5-000-mark-highest-in-delhi-since-2015-outbreak-101637001623430.html

EDMC commissioner Vikas Anand said that during a random inspection in Shahdara (north zone) on Monday as part of the ongoing drive to combat air pollution and maintaining cleanliness in the area, it was found that the sanitary inspectors of ward numbers 43-E and 47-E were not performing their duties properly. “Since they were found not taking appropriate action to stop the open burning of garbage in their wards, they have been suspended for negligence in their duties. Since the EDMC is making every effort to control the increasing level of air pollution in its area, such negligence by the officials will not be tolerated. We have served show-cause notices to both the officials,” he said. Anand, who also convened a meeting with the higher officials about the pollution-controlling measures in the EDMC area, said that different teams have been constituted to keep a round-the-clock tab on pollution. “All the employees and officers have been asked to do their duties honestly as the civic agency has already started taking strict action against the various activities causing pollution. EDMC has already issued seven challans for illegal dumping of construction and demolition waste at unauthorised locations, 14 challans for dust violations at construction sites and 108 challans for illegal dumping of garbage in this week so far,” he said.

16-11-2021||Delhi||Deposit seized cash and other valuables in banks, police told||The Delhi Police have issued a circular directing station house officers (SHOs) of all police stations and investigating officers (IOs) to deposit cash seized in cases as fixed deposits in national banks, and jewellery and other precious items in bank lockers.The directions were issued by special commissioner of police (crime) Devesh Chandra Srivastva and are part of the effort to decongest the malkhanas (store room where case property is kept) and reduce the scope for misappropriation or replacement of the valuable articles.The circular was prepared following the order of a local court that accepted and appreciated the application by an IO and SHO of the Palam Village police station, allowing them to transfer ₹96,340 in cash -- seized during a raid on a gambling racket -- from the maalkhana to a fixed deposit account to be opened in the name of the police station.As per the circular issued by the special CP, the cash seized in various cases will be deposited in nationalised banks as fixed deposit receipts (FDRs) after opening an account in the name of the SHO of the concerned police station. For jewellery and other precious items, the circular says that such items will be kept in bank lockers after taking permission from the courts. The rent of the lockers will be paid from Delhi Police’s regular budget.In the circular, Srivastava has directed the police officers to produce seized items before the concerned magistrate within a period of one week, for its release to the rightful owner. In case of no claimants, the SHO has been directed to approach the court and seek its approval for depositing the cash in the bank through an FDR for a year.About the interest accumulated in the FDRs and its future use, the circular says that if the court orders the disposal of the seized cash in the government’s favour, the principal amount as well as the gained interest money will be deposited in the consolidated fund of India.But if the order comes in favour of the owner of the property, the principal amount will be returned to him or her while the interest accrued on it will be deposited in the government’s fund unless the court order mentions otherwise.Senior officers welcomed the move. “This will minimise the risk arising from keeping the seized cash and valuables in maalkhanas. It will also reduce the scope for misappropriation... The seized property can be put to a more constructive use,” said a senior police officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/deposit-seized-cash-valuables-in-banks-delhi-police-told-101637000963320.html
16-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, European Union ambassador discuss Covid, pollution||European Union ambassador to India Ugo Astuto met chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday and discussed Delhi’s role in handling the Covid-19 pandemic and measures to mitigate air pollution in the national capital, the Delhi government said in a statement. “There is no new strain of the virus in Delhi. Nearly 50% of the eligible population is fully vaccinated and about 90% have taken at least one jab. We are working rapidly to vaccinate everyone. I am constantly monitoring the trends of Covid-19 and keeping an eye out for any situation where the graphs may seem to increase,” the statement quoted Kejriwal as saying.The chief minister was keen to understand Europe’s experience with the recent surge in Covid-19 and asked the ambassador for his inputs in protecting Delhi from a similar scenario. The ambassador said the situation largely depended on the rate of vaccination and ideally it should be easier to handle when most of the population has taken the jab, the statement said.Kejriwal also apprised Astuto about the Delhi government’s efforts in controlling pollution throughout the year. “About 5,000 to 6,000 industrial units of Delhi were made to switch to green fuel in the form of PNG (piped natural gas) by the Delhi government. Earlier, these industries relied on heavily polluting industrial fuels so it was our top priority to make them switch over to healthier practices,” Kejriwal said in the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-cm-arvind-kejriwal-european-union-ambassador-discuss-covid-pollution-101637000783218.html

16-11-2021||Lucknow||Purvanchal Expressway sets pitch for poll battle in eastern UP||The 341-km long Purvanchal Expressway has set the pitch for electoral battle between the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the opposition parties in eastern Uttar Pradesh during the 2022 assembly polls in the state.Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate the expressway connecting Lucknow with the districts of eastern UP in a programme in Sultanpur district on Tuesday (November 16). The expressway passes through nine districts—Lucknow, Barabanki, Amethi, Sultanpur, Faizabad, Ambedkar Nagar, Azamgarh, Mau and Ghazipur—considered to be a strong base of the Samajwadi Party (SP), Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Congress.The BJP plans to showcase the six-lane expressway constructed at an estimated cost of ₹22,497 crore in a big way to retain power in the state. Besides working to consolidate gains made in eastern UP in the 2017 assembly elections, it is projecting the expressway as a road that will transform the backward regions of eastern UP into a developed area.To make the inauguration programme a grand event, the saffron brigade has mobilised its resources and cadre from across the eastern UP, also known as Purvanchal region, as it wishes to send a message to the voters about its commitment for the development of the region.Terming Purvanchal Expressway a highway of development, chief minister Yogi Adityanath has said, “Eastern UP, which was neglected after independence, is now moving at a fast pace on the path of development. The expressway will become the backbone of the economy of the eastern UP. At eight spots on the expressway, the state government will develop industrial corridor to give fillip to industrial and business activities. The state government has issued a notification for the development of the industrial corridor.”Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, however, says the Purvanchal Expressway project was actually conceived by his government. “The SP government completed the Agra Expressway within 22 months whereas the BJP government is inaugurating an incomplete Purvanchal Expressway. The people are aware of the fact and they cannot be misled,” he claimed.BSP chief Mayawati too had said, “The BJP is trying to take credit for the Purvanchal Expressway that is not correct. The plan of the expressway project to connect NOIDA in west UP with the districts of east UP was prepared when the BSP was in power. Due to the hurdles put by the then Congress government (at the Centre), the project could not be launched.”A political observer SK Srivastava said, “Fearing that farmers’ agitation as well as Samajwadi Party- Rashtriya Lok Dal alliance will make a dent in its electoral fortunes in west Uttar Pradesh in the 2022 assembly election, the BJP has set its eyes on the eastern UP to retain power. The battle for the eastern UP will be decisive in deciding the fate of the political parties in the upcoming assembly election could be gauged from the fact that out of the 403 assembly seats in the state, 160 are in this region.”In the 2017 UP assembly election, the BJP came to power with a landslide victory but the SP and the BSP were able to check the saffron brigade in their strongholds Azamgarh and Ambedkar Nagar respectively. The SP alliance this time with Om Prakash Rajbhar-led Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) that has support base in Ghazipur, Mau and Sultanpur districts has caused concern in the BJP camp. To counter the SBSP, union home minister Amit Shah on November 13 announced that a state university coming up in Azamgarh will be named after king Suheldev, Srivastava said.“The BJP is leaving no stone unturned to bag maximum assembly seats in eastern UP and this could be gauged from the fact that Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched a slew of development projects in eastern UP, including inauguration of the international airport at Kushinagar, a medical college at Siddharthnagar, development projects in his constituency Varanasi, within a month. He is likely to inaugurate an AIIMS and a fertiliser factory in Gorakhpur and the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor project in Varanasi this month,” Srivastava said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/purvanchal-expressway-sets-pitch-for-poll-battle-in-eastern-up-101636995143251.html
16-11-2021||Lucknow||PM to visit UP today, inaugurate Purvanchal Expressway||LUCKNOW Prime Minister Narendra Modi will land on the Purvanchal Expressway in a C-130J Super Hercules transport aircraft, when he arrives to inaugurate the 340-kilometre-long road at Karwal Kheri in Sultanpur district on Tuesday. After the event, he will address a public meeting and witness an air show organised by the Indian Air Force (IAF). A 3.3-km stretch has been developed for allowing fighter aircraft to make emergency landings near the Sultanpur district. The Mirage 2000 and Su-30MKI aircraft would be making multiple take-offs and landings at the emergency airstrip, which will be watched by PM Modi and other dignitaries. The Purvanchal Expressway starts from Chandsarai village in Lucknow and ends at Haidaria village located on National Highway 31 in Ghazipur (18 km from UP-Bihar border). It is a six-lane expressway that can be expanded to eight lanes in future.Constructed at an estimated cost of about ₹22,500 crore, the expressway is going to give a boost to economic development of eastern parts of Uttar Pradesh, especially the districts of Lucknow, Barabanki, Amethi, Ayodhya, Sultanpur, Ambedkar Nagar, Azamgarh, Mau and Ghazipur, an official statement said.“Despite the Covid pandemic, the state government constructed the expressway on schedule. People residing in eastern UP as well as the bordering districts in Bihar can reach Delhi within 9 hours,” said Awanish Awasthi, CEO, UP Expressway Industrial Development Authority (UPEIDA), addressing a press conference. The expressway passes through nine districts including Lucknow, Barabanki, Amethi, Ayodhya, Sultanpur, Ambedkar Nagar, Azamgarh, Mau and Ghazipur, he added.The expressway will have CNG stations, electric recharge stations for vehicles and will be connected with the Defence Corridor via the Agra and Bundelkhand expressways. While public amenities were being developed on the expressway, it will have two toll plazas – one at the point where the expressway commences and the other where it will terminate. The decision to charge toll on the expressway will be taken later, said Awasthi.The expressway has been designed for the movement of vehicles at a speed of 120 km per hour but the speed has been fixed at 100 kmph. Construction agencies faced difficulties due to the low lying terrain in Azamgarh and Mau districts and heavy rains in September affected construction works, he said.The state government had authorised UPEIDA to develop industrial hubs on the both sides of the expressway. Police vehicles, cattle catchers’ vehicle and 16 ambulances will be deployed for safety and medical emergencies. Intensive plantation had also been carried out on both sides of the expressway, he added.The state government plans to provide facilities to industrial training institutes, educational institutes, medical institutes near the expressway. The expressway will work as a catalyst for the development of handloom, food processing units, storage plants, markets and dairy units, beverages, chemicals products, coke and refined petroleum products, electrical equipment, medical and dental instruments. The expressway will also give boost to tourism in eastern UP, said UPEIDA chairman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/pm-to-visit-up-today-inaugurate-purvanchal-expressway-101636994483123.html

The Maoists ordered the Bhokta families and their sympathisers to leave the village and threatened if they failed to do so, they would face dire consequences. Following this, Mahendra’s mother Sukwaria Devi, father Saryug Singh Bhokta, his 10-year-old son, besides two nephews and a niece, shifted to a relative’s house at Chanchal-Goraiya village barely a kilometre away.On Monday, when HT visited the village, the villagers were engaged in agriculture and other work, with no policeman in sight. A few men willing to talk admitted that those who fled were scared of both the police and the Maoists. B“...they killed four members and left a seven-page pamphlet there, stating the action was to avenge four of their commanders killed by the CoBRA battalion 205 at the same place,” one of victim’s family member, Babita Devi said.The Maoists alleged that their comrades were poisoned by the women.Gaya SSP Aditya Kumar said a case had been lodged against 15 persons, including Vivek Yadav, Indal and 40 unknown Maoists on the basis of the statement of the deceased’s uncle Mangroo Bhokta. Asked about security arrangements, the SSP admitted that the family had shifted to another place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/locals-flee-gaya-village-after-public-executions-by-maoists-101636989805270.html

The DRG team cordoned off the area and suddenly Maoists started firing,” said a senior police officer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.The other Maoists fled from the spot after and escaped into the jungles.“The dead body was identified as Saket Nureti alias Bhaskar Nureti, commander of the outlawed Peoples’ Liberation Guerilla Army (PLGA) company no. 6 of the Maoists. The company works in East Bastar division.

The idol has been brought back to India from Canada after 108 years.“After 108 years, the idol of Annapurna has arrived in Kashi and was reinstalled in Kashi Dham. The entire credit goes to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for bringing back the rare idol of Mata Annapurna to Kashi,” Yogi Adityanath said, addressing the gathering at the International Cooperation and Convention Centre “Rudraksh” in Varanasi.No one else cared about the Ganga before PM Modi and the river now is flowing “aviral” (uninterrupted) and “nirmal” (clean), he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/they-ruled-in-mahatma-gandhi-s-name-but-didn-t-keep-kashi-vishwanath-temple-clean-yogi-adityanath-101636977081577.html
16-11-2021||World||World Food Program chief shares plan to spend $6billion to end hunger after Elon Musk vowed to sell Tesla stocks||Over two weeks since SpaceX founder Elon Musk asked the United Nations’ World Food Programme (WFP) to describe how six billion USD would save world hunger and the UN programme finally responded to it on Tuesday (IST).David Beasley, executive director of the WFP, said that they were ready to talk with Musk and anybody who is “serious” about saving lives. He also shared the WFP’s plan outlining the breakdown of the amount (6.6 billion USD) that would be spent to save 42 million people from famine.Why is the UN asking $ 6.6 billion?It all started with an interview by Beasley to American news network CNN. “The billionaires need to step up now. On a one-time basis, six billion dollars (USD), to help 42 million people that are literally going to die if we don’t reach them. It’s not complicated,” an animated Beasley told during an interview in ‘Connect the World’ program.This hunger crisis is urgent, unprecedented, AND avoidable. @elonmusk, you asked for a clear plan & open books. Here it is! We're ready to talk with you - and anyone else - who is serious about saving lives. The ask is $6.6B to avert famine in 2022: https://t.co/eJLmfcMVqEHe also said that it was a one-time donation and not something that people need to do “everyday or every week.” He pointed out that the top 400 billionaires in the US saw an increase in net worth of 1.8 trillion USD in the last year and said “All I am asking for is 0.36% of your net worth increase.”But why Musk?Notably, during the interview, Beasly said, “Just last week Elon Musk had a 6-billion-dollars net worth increase in one day.” CNN then reported that the billionaire is worth $289 billion and the WFP is asking for a mere 2% donation.Also read | Nearly 55% of Afghans expected to face food insecurity soon, UN report saysResponding to the article, Musk on October 31 said that he would sell stocks of his popular company Tesla and donate if the WFP can explain its claims.“If WFP can describe on this Twitter thread exactly how $6B will solve world hunger, I will sell Tesla stock right now and do it,” he tweeted. “But it must be open source accounting, so the public sees precisely how the money is spent,” he also said.But it must be open source accounting, so the public sees precisely how the money is spent.WFP’s planMeanwhile, the Beasley on the day said, “This hunger crisis is urgent, unprecedented, AND avoidable. @elonmusk, you asked for a clear plan & open books. Here it is! We're ready to talk with you - and anyone else - who is serious about saving lives. The ask is $6.6B to avert famine in 2022.”So here is the breakup of the amount issued by the WFP. Of the total $3.5 billion would be used for food and delivery which includes the cost of shipping and transport to the destination country, warehousing and last mile delivery that also includes security escorts in conflict zones.Also read | UN official warns of increasing child marriages in Afghanistan, calls for actionFor cash and food vouchers in countries where the markets can function, $2billion has been earmarked by the WFP. While $700 million and $400 million would respectively be used for “country-specific costs to design, scale up and manage the implementation of efficient and effective programmes” and “lobal and regional operations management, administration and accountability.”Only five countries -- Afghanistan, Madagascar, South Sudan, Sudan and Yemen -- account for 20 million people, Beasley highlighted. “They are the frontlines of hunger. What I’ve seen in each of these countries is worse than you can possibly imagine,” he said.Meanwhile, Musk is yet to respond to Beasley’s call for further talks on any of the social media platforms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-food-program-chief-shares-plan-to-spend-6billion-to-end-hunger-after-elon-musk-vowed-to-sell-tesla-stocks-101637084386967.html

China was the first country sanctioned under this law in 2018; followed by Turkey, a Nato ally, in 2020; both over S-400.Trump administration official, specially then defence secretary James Mattis had argued for waiver for India and New Delhi has since, and because of other indications, believed its purchase of S-400 will be exempted from sanctions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-expresses-concern-over-s-400-deliveries-to-india-101637081489281.html

16-11-2021||World||Facebook says Pak hackers targeted Afghan users amid govt collapse: Report||Hackers from Pakistan used Facebook to target people in Afghanistan with connections to the previous government during the Taliban's takeover of the country, the company's threat investigators said in an interview with Reuters.Facebook said the group, known in the security industry as SideCopy, shared links to websites hosting malware that could surveil people's devices. Targets included people connected to the government, military, and law enforcement in Kabul, it said. Facebook said it removed SideCopy from its platform in August.The social media company, which recently changed its name to Meta, said the group created fictitious personas of young women as “romantic lures” to build trust and trick targets into clicking phishing links or downloading malicious chat apps. It also compromised legitimate websites to manipulate people into giving up their Facebook credentials."It's always difficult for us to speculate as to the end goal of the threat actor," Facebook's head of cyber espionage investigations, Mike Dvilyanski, said. "We don't know exactly who was compromised or what the end result of that was."Major online platforms and email providers including Facebook, Twitter Inc, Alphabet Inc's Google, and Microsoft Corp's LinkedIn have said they took steps to lock down Afghan users' accounts during the Taliban's swift takeover of the country this past summer.Facebook said it had not previously disclosed the hacking campaign, which it said ramped up between April and August, due to safety concerns about its employees in the country and the need for more work to investigate the network. It said it shared information with the US state department at the time it took down the operation.Investigators also said Facebook had last month disabled the accounts of two hacking groups which it linked to Syria's Air Force Intelligence.Facebook said one group, known as the Syrian Electronic Army, targeted human rights activists, journalists, and others opposing the ruling regime, while the other targeted people linked to the Free Syrian Army and former military personnel who had joined opposition forces.Facebook's head of global threat disruption, David Agranovich, said the Syria and Afghanistan cases showed cyberespionage groups leveraging periods of uncertainty during conflicts when people might be more susceptible to manipulation.The company said a third hacking network in Syria, which is linked to the Syrian government and removed in October, targeted minority groups, activists, and members of the People's Protection Units (YPG) and Syria Civil Defense, or White Helmets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-says-pak-hackers-targeted-afghan-users-amid-govt-collapse-report-101637072020965.html

US officials said Monday's test had generated a debris field in low-Earth orbit that endangered the International Space Station (ISS) and that would pose a hazard to space activities for years.Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg said the test was reckless, posed a threat to the ISS and an orbiting Chinese spacecraft, and showed Russia was developing new weapons systems. A British government spokesperson condemned the test and urged Moscow to join discussions at the United Nations on "responsible behaviour when it comes to space."Russia's defence ministry said the debris from the test had not posed a threat to the ISS, and that Washington knew this."The Russian Ministry of Defence successfully conducted a test on Nov. 15 that hit the non-operational Russian spacecraft Tselina-D, which had been in orbit since 1982," it said in a statement.It said the United States, China and India had conducted similar tests in the past.Russia, it said, was being forced to beef up its defence capabilities because of what it said were weapons tests by the United States and Washington establishing a space force in 2020.Moscow said it had called for years for an agreement to stop weapons being deployed in space, but that Washington and its allies had blocked the deal at the United Nations.Officials from the US space agency Nasa will seek to discuss anti-satellite weapon testing on Wednesday during a trip to Moscow, Russia's RIA news agency cited Nasa's head as saying on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russias-anti-satellite-weapons-test-draws-critique-from-us-nato-101637067963063.html
16-11-2021||World||Xi Jinping greets Joe Biden as ‘old friend’, warns him against playing with Taiwan fire||Chinese President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Joe Biden on Tuesday talked about avoiding conflict and jointly responding to global challenges like climate change as the two leaders met for more than 200 minutes via video link, the first such meeting since Biden became president in January.Xi greeted Biden as “old friend” at the beginning of the meeting on Tuesday morning (China time), spoke about Beijing and Washington’s responsibility in responding to challenges like climate change and the Covid-19 pandemic but also warned the US against pushing for the independence of the self-ruled democracy, Taiwan, which China claims as its own.‘PLAYING WITH FIRE’Xi described the intention of some people in the US to “use Taiwan to control China” as a dangerous trend. “It is playing with fire, and those who play with fire get burned,” Xi said.“Complete reunification of China is the common aspiration of all sons and daughters of the Chinese nation,” Xi told Biden. “We are patient and willing to do our utmost to strive for the prospect of peaceful reunification with the utmost sincerity,” Xi was quoted as saying by official Chinese media.Xi said China will be compelled to take resolute measures, should the separatist forces for ‘Taiwan independence’, “…provoke us, force our hands or even cross the red line”.On Taiwan, Chinese official media quoted Biden as saying that the US government does not support “Taiwan independence” forces.Biden told Xi that they “need to rebuild the guardrail of consensus, be clear and honest about our differences, and work together on areas of mutual interest, especially on major global issues like climate change”.PRINCIPLE OF MUTUAL BENEFITChinese state media quoted Xi as saying that China and the US are “…two huge ships sailing in the middle of the ocean. We should keep the rudders steady so that the two giant ships can move forward together in the face of wind and waves without drifting, stalling or colliding”.“We should adhere to the principle of mutual benefit and not play a zero-sum game,” Xi said.Xi had met for a “…thorough and in-depth communication and exchanges with US President Joe Biden in a rare long virtual meeting on Tuesday morning during which they discussed strategic and fundamental issues on the development of bilateral relations”, the Global Times said in a report on Tuesday.Chinese observers said “…the meeting will inject certainty into the bilateral ties and is sending a signal that the two countries will cooperate in many areas” despite not being able to avoid “fierce competition” in other areas.The first face-to-face virtual meeting between the top two leaders lasted three hours and 24 minutes.A video released by China’s national broadcaster, CCTV showed Xi saying he was very happy to see his “old friend” and that it was crucial for China and the US to work together in addressing common challenges.PEACEFUL COEXISTENCEChina and the US should respect each other, coexist in peace, and pursue win-win cooperation, Xi told Biden, adding that the two countries need to cooperate to respond to global challenges like climate change and the Covid-19 pandemic.“Xi expressed his readiness to work with President Biden to build consensus and take active steps to move China-US relations forward in a positive direction,” a statement issued by the Xinhua news agency, quoted Xi as saying.“Advancing global peace and development is the “…joint mission of Chinese and American leaders”, Xi said.Xi pointed out that both China and the US are at critical stages of development, and the “global village” of humanity faces multiple challenges.The Chinese President spoke about the need to “increase” communication between the two countries.“As the world’s two largest economies and permanent members of the UN Security Council, China and the US need to increase communication and cooperation, each run their domestic affairs well and, at the same time, shoulder their share of international responsibilities, and work together to advance the noble cause of world peace and development,” Xi told Biden.“This is the shared desire of the people of the two countries and around the world, and the joint mission of Chinese and American leaders,” Xi said.Xi expressed his readiness to work with Biden to build consensus and take active steps to move China-US relations forward in a positive direction.“Doing so will advance the interests of the two peoples and meet the expectation of the international community,” Xi said.On the issue of human rights, Xi said China is willing to conduct dialogue on human rights issues on the basis of mutual respect but is not in favour of using human rights to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries.Xi, according to official media, said the people can judge if a nation is democratic or not, and it’s undemocratic in itself to exclude others only because of their different forms of achieving democracy.Xi was accompanied by some of China’s top politicians and diplomats, according to Chinese state media.Ding Xuexiang, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and director of the General Office of the CPC Central Committee, Chinese vice-premier Liu He, Yang Jiechi, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the CPC Central Committee, Chinese state councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi as well as vice foreign minister Xie Feng were among the attendees to the meeting, according to photo of the video meeting released by Xinhua.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-jinping-greets-joe-biden-as-old-friend-warns-him-against-playing-with-taiwan-fire-101637061568038.html
16-11-2021||World||Son of late Philippine dictator emerges as presidential frontrunner||The son of late Philippines strongman Ferdinand Marcos has emerged as the person to beat in the 2022 presidential race after president Rodrigo Duterte's popular daughter decided not to contest the country's top job.Ferdinand Marcos Jr likely benefited the most from Davao city mayor Sara Duterte-Carpio's move to run for vice president, against the wishes of her supporters, despite leading polls for preferred presidential contenders all throughout the year.“Without the popular Duterte-Carpio in the presidential race, Marcos is the frontrunner, with 60 per cent odds of victory, though there is a long road ahead,” the Eurasia Group consultancy said in a note to clients late on Monday, after nominations closed.While Marcos's candidacy has angered victims of his father's brutal era of martial law, a survey by the Social Weather Station (SWS) in October showed he could easily beat his rivals, including boxing hero Manny Pacquiao.Of the six key candidates confirmed to run for president at the time the poll was conducted, 47 per cent of the 1,200 surveyed by the SWS said they would vote for the 64-year old Marcos, popularly known as “Bongbong” or “BBM”.“The only explanation there is he got the pro-Sara voters. There is a very close affinity between BBM voters and Sara's voters,” said political analyst Temario Rivera.The election to choose a successor to Duterte will be held in May next year. He himself is not eligible to contest for the presidency again after his single six-year term but will be standing in the election for a senator's seat.Marcos is the only son of the late dictator who ruled the Philippines for almost two decades until his 1986 overthrow. He said he wants Duterte-Carpio to be his running mate, but she has yet to accept.Marcos's family is among the country's most famous dynasties and despite its fall from grace, has retained far-reaching and powerful connections.‘Stop-Marcos candidate’Marcos, the dictator, died in exile in 1989 after fleeing the country following the “people power” revolution. Since the family's return, Marcos junior has been elected governor, congressman, and in 2010, as a senator. His sister is a senator and a former governor, and his mother, Imelda Marcos, was elected to Congress for four terms.“In a country whereby political memories are quite short and forgiveness is not in short supply, this is definitely working in favour of the Marcoses,” said Richard Heydarian, an author, columnist and academic who specialises in politics.Working to his advantage, political analysts also say, is Marcos's strong social media presence aimed at targeting the youth, who make up a third of eligible voters. Many of them were not born when Marcos senior was in power.The poll results showed the other presidential candidates far adrift, with incumbent Vice President Leni Robredo with 18 per cent, and Manila mayor Francisco Domagoso on 13 per cent, followed by Pacquiao with 9 per cent.The poll did not include Christopher “Bong” Go, Duterte's closest aide, who only joined the presidential race on Saturday, and analysts say his entry, which is backed by the popular firebrand leader, could dilute some of Marcos' support.Marcos is also facing a disqualification case grounded on a two-decade old tax evasion conviction, which Eurasia said Duterte could “weaponise if he turns against his ally”.The race could narrow too, if Marcos's rivals unite behind a single “stop-Marcos” candidate in the race, Eurasia said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/son-of-late-philippine-dictator-emerges-as-presidential-frontrunner-101637057510749.html

16-11-2021||World||What is International Day for Tolerance and why is it observed?||International Day for Tolerance is commemorated every year on November 16 to foster mutual understanding among different cultures and strengthen tolerance among people.The United Nations declared November 16 as the International Day for tolerance in 1995 as it was the same day when the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco) formulated the Declaration of Principles on Tolerance.To mark the day, various events are organised around the world at educational institutions to generate awareness about the importance of tolerance among cultures and socio-economic groups.Unesco-Madanjeet Singh PrizeIn the same year, Unesco created a prize for the promotion of tolerance and non-violence and to mark the United Nations Year for Tolerance and the 125th anniversary of the birth of Mahatma Gandhi. The prize was named after Madanjeet Singh who sponsored the celebrations in the year. In 2000, Singh also became the UN’s goodwill ambassador and contributed immensely to bringing communal harmony among communities.The prize is titled Unesco-Madanjeet Singh Prize for the Promotion of Tolerance and Non-Violence and rewards significant activities in the scientific, artistic, cultural or communication fields aimed at the promotion of a spirit of tolerance and non-violence. It is awarded every two years on November 16.Last time, the Unesco-Madanjeet Singh Prize for the Promotion of Tolerance and Non-Violence was awarded in 2020 to the nongovernmental Centre Résolution Conflits (Centre for Resolution of Conflicts - CRC) in the Democratic Republic of Congo.The international Jury of the Prize recommended the CRC in recognition of its work for the defence of human rights, its "tireless (commitment to the) rescue of child soldiers from militia groups, and their rehabilitation and reintegration into their home communities. (CRC) also brings together communities from different tribes to live together in peace by conducting special training for this purpose," according to Unesco's site.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-is-international-day-for-tolerance-and-why-is-it-observed-101637038428464.html

Violent crimes, such as sexual assault, has occurred at tourist sites and in other locations," it said.The department in its advisory for Pakistan urged US citizens not to travel to Balochistan province and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province, including the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), due to terrorism and kidnapping, and also in the immediate vicinity of the Line of Control due to terrorism and the potential for armed conflict."Terrorist groups continue plotting attacks in Pakistan. A local history of terrorism and ongoing ideological aspirations of violence by extremist elements have led to indiscriminate attacks on civilian as well as local military and police targets," it said."Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting transportation hubs, markets, shopping malls, military installations, airports, universities, tourist locations, schools, hospitals, places of worship, and government facilities," it said.Terrorists have targeted US diplomats and diplomatic facilities in the past, the advisory on Pakistan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-cdc-issues-level-one-covid-19-travel-health-notice-for-india-101637037479443.html

Although it's not as good as a face-to-face meeting, I'm very happy to see my old friend," the Chinese leader said he began speaking after Biden called for more understanding and cooperation between the two to avoid any conflict, in his opening statement.Biden too remembered his relationship with Xi while he was the US vice president under the Obama administration from 2009 to 2017. “We spent an awful lot of time talking to each other… Maybe I should start more formally even though you and I have never been that formal with one another,” the US president said.The summit comes amid the rising tension between the United States and China over a number of issues including trade, the South China Sea, human rights violations in Hong Kong and military aggression against Taiwan, and more. Despite being critical about each other in the past, the meeting on a hopeful note as Biden said that their goal is to ensure competition between the two largest economies, "does not veer into conflict.""It seems to me we need to establish some common-sense guardrails. To be clear and honest where we disagree, and work together where interests intersect, especially on vital global issues like climate change," Biden said as the summit opened.Meanwhile, Xi stressed that sound and steady China-US relations are required for advancing the two countries' respective development. “As the world's two largest economies and the permanent members of the UN Security Council, China and the United States need to increase communication and cooperation," he also said.Xi has not left China for nearly two years and Biden sharply criticised his absence at the recent COP26 climate summit in Glasgow and the G20 summit in Rome.The highly-anticipated summit is the third engagement between Xi, 68, and the 78-year-old US president, since Biden's inauguration in January. In the past, the two leaders have had lengthy discussions over a phone call.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-calls-biden-his-old-friend-as-us-china-talks-begin-on-a-warm-note-101637034069160.html

KCNA said Kim inspected the third and last phase of construction during his visit to the city.“Noting that the 4 year-long construction of Samjiyon City proved the irresistible might of the single-minded unity and harmonious whole of the Party and the people and also the iron will of our state to achieve prosperity our own way and with our own efforts, as well as its self-confidence and possibility of independent development, the General Secretary, in the name of the Party Central Committee, sent thanks to the builders, supporters and the people of the whole nation who brilliantly realized the decisions and policies of the Party,” KCNA said.Also read | North Korea's mechanised troops conduct artillery fire drill“He said that the achievements, experience and standards gained through the construction of Samjiyon City serve as correct guidelines for pushing forward our Party's policy of local construction in the right direction. He added that this has great significance in the on-going struggle for making a new start for the change of local areas,” it added.Samjiyon city is being changed into a massive economic hub, called a "socialist utopia” by officials, and will have new apartments, hotels, a ski resort and commercial, cultural and medical facilities.Also read | North Koreans facing food shortages, collapses in livelihoods: UN investigatorSamjiyon city is near Mount Paektu, the holy mountain where Kim's family claims its roots, and he has made multiple visits since 2018.According to KCNA, the construction at Samjiyon city could be finished by the end of this year, when he will complete a decade in rule since taking power following the death of his father in December 2011.Also read | Kim Jong Un lost 20kg but remains healthy: ReportThe transformation of Samjiyon into a “model cultured city” was one of the main focuses of a nationwide construction campaign that North Korea wanted to finish in time for the 75th anniversary of its ruling party’s founding in October 2020. However, construction was slowed amid the coronavirus pandemic and international sanctions over Kim’s nuclear weapon and missile programs.“Claiming the success of Samjiyon’s development is politically important at this time because the Mount Paekdu region is central to North Korean mythology and the embellished story of the previous leader‘s birth,” Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, told the Associated Press.While KCNA did not give a date for Kim's visit, it is the first report of public activity by the leader for 35 days, his longest absence since 2014.

Xi pointed out that both China and the US are at critical stages of development, and the “global village” of humanity faces multiple challenges.The Chinese President spoke about the need to “increase” communication between the two countries.“As the world’s two largest economies and permanent members of the UN Security Council, China and the US need to increase communication and cooperation, each run their domestic affairs well and, at the same time, shoulder their share of international responsibilities, and work together to advance the noble cause of world peace and development,” Xi told Biden.“This is the shared desire of the people of the two countries and around the world, and the joint mission of Chinese and American leaders,” Xi said.According to the Xinhua statement, Xi expressed his readiness to work with Biden to build consensus and take active steps to move China-US relations forward in a positive direction.“Doing so will advance the interests of the two peoples and meet the expectation of the international community,” Xi said.On the issue of human rights, Xi said China is willing to conduct dialogue on human rights issues on the basis of mutual respect but is not in favour of using human rights to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries.Xi said the people can judge if a nation is democratic or not, and it is undemocratic in itself to exclude others only because of their different forms of achieving democracy, according to Chinese state media.Xi is accompanied by some of China’s top politicians and diplomats, according to Chinese state media.Ding Xuexiang, a member of the political bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and director of the General Office of the CPC Central Committee, Chinese Vice-Premier Liu He, Yang Jiechi, a member of the political bureau of the CPC Central Committee and director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the CPC Central Committee, Chinese state councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi as well as vice foreign minister Xie Feng are among the attendees to the meeting, according to photo of the video meeting released by Xinhua.Chinese state-controlled media said on Monday that Beijing will ask Washington to “step back” on its policies and statements on the self-ruled and democratic island, which China claims as a breakaway region.The situation in Afghanistan, bilateral trade, nuclear proliferation and cybersecurity are likely to be discussed during the talks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/advancing-global-peace-is-china-us-joint-mission-xi-jinping-tells-joe-biden-101637030785659.html

Whoever is responsible for this has shown great disrespect to the Australian-Indian community and should be ashamed," Morrison added.Meanwhile, Australia India Community Charitable Trust chair Vasan Srinivasan said the offenders were trying to cut off the head of the statute by grinding around it. With nearly 300,000 Indians living in Victoria, Srinivasan said it was never expected that such an act could take place.The Australian Indian Community Centre in Rowville is the first such centre of the Indian community in Victoria and was established after three decades of effort, Surya Prakash Soni, president of the Federation of Indian Associations of Victoria, said, according to a report by the ABC.The Victoria Police said that an unknown number of offenders used a tool to decapitate the statue between last Friday and Saturday, the ABC report said, adding the Knox Crime Investigation Unit detectives are probing the matter and have urged witnesses to come forward with any details.In January this year, a statue of Mahatma Gandhi was vandalised in the United States in the Central Park of the City of Davis in Northern California.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mahatma-gandhi-s-statue-vandalised-in-australia-a-day-after-unveiling-101637025619328.html
16-11-2021||World||'Guardrails' needed to prevent US-China ‘conflict': Joe Biden tells Xi in virtual meeting||US President Joe Biden and China's Xi Jinping opened a virtual summit Monday with an appeal for better communication between the superpowers and "guardrails" to avoid conflict.Speaking from the White House to Xi on a television screen, Biden said they must develop "guardrails" to "ensure that the competition between our countries does not veer into conflict, whether intended or unintended."He said they would have a "candid" discussion.Xi, speaking from Beijing, called Biden "my old friend," but said the rivals must work more closely."China and the United States need to increase communication and cooperation," he said.The two leaders have spoken by phone twice since Biden's inauguration in January but with Xi refusing to travel abroad because of the pandemic, an online video meeting was the only option short of an in-person summit.White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Biden was going into the summit, expected to last a couple of hours, "from a position of strength," after months of rebuilding alliances with other democracies to contain China.The meeting is "an opportunity to set the terms of the competition with China" and to insist the leadership in Beijing "play by the rules of the road," Psaki said.Most of the attention in the build-up to the meeting has focused on the sparring over Taiwan, a self-ruling democracy claimed by China. Biden's aides have cast the summit as an opportunity to help prevent tensions from escalating.Biden will "make clear that we want to build common guardrails to avoid miscalculation," a senior US administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told reporters.However, the White House sought to temper expectations, with the official saying that the summit "is not a meeting where we expect deliverables to be coming out."Biden, a veteran of foreign policy issues during his decades in politics, has often said phone conversations are no substitute for face-to-face meetings.Xi has not left China for nearly two years, and Biden sharply criticized his absence at the recent COP26 climate summit in Glasgow and G20 summit in Rome.Biden gets domestic boostRelations between the superpowers plummeted during the presidency of Donald Trump, who launched a trade war with China while assailing Beijing's response to an international probe into the origins of the Covid pandemic in the Chinese city of Wuhan.Biden has recast the confrontation more broadly as a struggle between democracy and autocracy.He got a boost on Monday when he signed into law a $1.2 trillion infrastructure package, the biggest of its kind in more than half a century. Biden describes the initiative as an important step in catching up with years of intensive Chinese government investments, thereby proving that democracies can compete."The world is changing," he said. "We have to be ready."While the day-to-day tone is more measured than in the Trump era, tension over Taiwan is threatening to escalate into dangerous new territory.China has ramped up military activities near Taiwan in recent years, with a record number of warplanes intruding into the island's air defense zone in October.The United States says it supports Taiwan's self-defense but is ambiguous about whether it would intervene to help directly."Any connivance of and support for the 'Taiwan independence' forces undermines peace across the Taiwan Strait and would only boomerang in the end," Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in a telephone call heading into the weekend.And China's foreign ministry on Monday put the onus on Biden to improve relations."We hope that the US will work in the same direction as China to get along with each other," foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters.The US administration official signaled Biden would be "very direct" on what he called "China's coercive and provocative behavior with respect to Taiwan."But the official also stressed that the two nations had room for cooperation in various areas, such as climate change.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/guardrails-needed-to-prevent-us-china-conflict-joe-biden-tells-xi-in-virtual-meeting-101637024621707.html
16-11-2021||World||Debris from Russian space missile test puts ISS crew in danger||A Russian weapons test that blasted a satellite out of orbit on Monday spewed debris and endangered seven crew members on the International Space Station, according to US and British authorities.The ground-launched, anti-satellite missile destroyed one of Russia’s own satellites, generating more than 1,500 pieces of debris and hundreds of thousands of smaller chunks, according to the US State Department.“We call upon all responsible spacefaring nations to join us in efforts to develop norms of responsible behavior and to refrain from conducting dangerous and irresponsible destructive tests like those carried out by Russia,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.Five astronauts and two cosmonauts are aboard the space station, which is linked with two craft that carried passengers from Earth -- the US SpaceX Crew Dragon and a Russian Soyuz. The crew was awakened and directed to close hatches between modules on the orbiting platform and then retreated into the Soyuz and Crew Dragon crafts for safety when the space station neared the debris field, according to NASA.“With its long and storied history in human spaceflight, it is unthinkable that Russia would endanger not only the American and international partner astronauts on the ISS, but also their own cosmonauts,” NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said in a statement. The Russian news agency Tass, quoting a source it didn’t identify, said the director of the Russian space agency, Roscosmos, plans to discuss the matter tomorrow by telephone with NASA. LeoLabs Inc., a private space-object tracking company, said data showed “multiple objects” near the expected location of Cosmos 1408. That Soviet signals intelligence satellite was launched in 1982, according to NASA.The American military tracked the event and said debris could remain aloft for decades, posing a significant risk to the crew on the International Space Station and other human spaceflight activities, as well as multiple countries’ satellites.“Russia has demonstrated a deliberate disregard for the security, safety, stability, and long-term sustainability of the space domain for all nations,” said Army General James Dickinson, US Space Command commander. Ben Wallace, the UK defense secretary, tweeted that “The debris resulting from this test will remain in orbit putting satellites and human spaceflight at risk for years to come.”The debris is in low-Earth orbit, an altitude that has attracted companies eager to cash in on reduced launch costs and a growing appetite for data and communications.There was no immediate indication that the newly formed debris threatened any commercial craft.There are about 4,550 operating satellites in orbit, with 3,790 in low-Earth orbit, according to a Sept. 1 tally by the Union of Concerned Scientists. Companies operating in low-Earth orbits include Elon Musk’s SpaceX, or Space Exploration Technologies Corp., which has sent aloft more than 1,800 satellites.More than 27,000 pieces of orbital debris, or “space junk,” are tracked by the Department of Defense, according to NASA. Near-Earth orbits hold much more debris that’s too small to be tracked, but large enough to threaten human spaceflight and robotic missions.Because debris and spacecraft are traveling at extremely high speeds (approximately 15,700 miles per hour, or 25,000 kilometers per hour), an impact of even a tiny piece of orbiting junk with a spacecraft could create big problems, according to the space agency.Moreover, chunks of a smashed satellite can disperse into an elliptical orbit, with some of the debris hundreds of kilometers higher or lower than the undisturbed orbit, Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Center for Astrophysics, a collaboration between Harvard University and the Smithsonian Institution, said in a tweet. “Debris-generating anti-satellite tests are a bad idea and should never be carried out,” McDowell tweeted.Space debris is a growing problem as thousands of satellites are launched, populating orbits more quickly than they are removed by active means or orbital decay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/debris-from-russian-space-missile-test-puts-iss-crew-in-danger-101637022689218.html
16-11-2021||World||Rittenhouse provoked bloodshed, walked off like a hero in a Western: Prosecutor||Kyle Rittenhouse provoked bloodshed on the streets of Kenosha by bringing a semi-automatic rifle to a protest and menacing others, and when the shooting stopped, he walked off like a “hero in a Western,” a prosecutor said in closing arguments Monday at Rittenhouse’s murder trial.But Rittenhouse’s lawyer countered that the shooting started after the young man was ambushed by a “crazy person” that night and feared his gun was going to be wrested away and used to kill him. Defense attorney Mark Richards said Rittenhouse acted in self-defense.Rittenhouse, then 17, shot two men to death and wounded a third during a tumultuous night of protests against racial injustice in the summer of 2020, a case that has stirred bitter debate in the US over guns, vigilantism and law and order.Rittenhouse said he went to Kenosha from his home in Antioch, Illinois, to protect property from rioters in the days after a Black man, Jacob Blake, was shot by a white Kenosha police officer. Rittenhouse, a former police youth cadet, is white, as were those he shot.In closing arguments, prosecutor Thomas Binger said Rittenhouse was a “wannabe soldier” and was “looking for trouble that night.” Binger repeatedly showed the jury drone video that he said depicted Rittenhouse pointing the AR-style weapon at demonstrators.“This is the provocation. This is what starts this incident,” the prosecutor declared.He told the jury: “You lose the right to self-defense when you’re the one who brought the gun, when you are the one creating the danger, when you’re the one provoking other people.”Rittenhouse, now 18, faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison if convicted of the most serious charge against him, first-degree intentional homicide, which is Wisconsin’s top murder charge.Binger zeroed in on the killing of 36-year-old Joseph Rosenbaum, who was the first man gunned down that night and whose shooting set in motion the ones that followed. The prosecutor repeatedly called it murder, saying it was unjustified.The prosecutor reminded jurors that Rittenhouse testified he knew Rosenbaum was unarmed. Binger also said there is no video to support the defense claim that Rosenbaum threatened to kill Rittenhouse.Binger disputed the contention that Rosenbaum was trying to grab Rittenhouse’s rifle. “Mr. Rosenbaum is not even within arm’s reach when the first shot occurs,” Binger said. He rejected the claim that Rittenhouse had no choice but to shoot, saying he could have run away.And Binger argued that once Rosenbaum was wounded, he was not even capable of taking away the gun, which was strapped to Rittenhouse’s body, since he was falling to the ground with a fractured pelvis. Rittenhouse kept firing, delivering what the prosecutor called the “kill shot” to Rosenbaum’s back.“I think we can also agree that we shouldn’t have 17-year-olds running around our streets with AR-15s, because this is exactly what happens,” Binger said.In his own closing argument, Richards, the defense attorney, called Rosenbaum a “crazy person” who was “hell-bent on causing trouble that night” and went after Rittenhouse unprovoked.“Mr. Rosenbaum was shot because he was chasing my client and going to kill him, take his gun and carry out the threats he made,” Richards said, adding that Rittenhouse never pointed his gun before being chased: “It didn’t happen.”After killing Rosenbaum, Rittenhouse shot and killed Anthony Huber, 26, and wounded Gaige Grosskreutz, 28, while trying to make his way through the crowd. Rittenhouse testified that Huber hit him with a skateboard and that Grosskreutz came at him with a gun of his own — an account largely corroborated by video and Grosskreutz himself.But the prosecutor said Rittenhouse provoked that bloodshed, too. He said Huber, Grosskreutz and others in the crowd were trying to stop what they believed was an active shooter.When it was all over, Rittenhouse walked away like a “hero in a Western — without a care in the world for anything he’s just done,” Binger said.The defense, though said Rittenhouse was set upon by a “mob.” Richards accused prosecutors of using the term “active shooter” for Rittenhouse because of “the loaded connotations of that word.”And in an apparent reference to the police shooting of a Black man that touched off the protests, Richards said: “Other people in this community have shot people seven times, and it’s been found to be OK.” ( No charges were brought against the white officer.)When the prosecutor displayed a photo of Rosenbaum’s bloodied body on a gurney during his autopsy and another of his mangled hand, some jurors appeared to avert their eyes. Later, when Binger displayed a close-up of Grosskreutz’s bicep largely obliterated by a bullet, several jurors winced and turned away.As he spoke, Binger walked up to the jury box and lifted Rittenhouse’s rifle as if he were firing, pointing the weapon at a wall.Jurors appeared riveted when Richards, the defense attorney, began addressing them in his booming voice.The sound of a small group of protesters chanting outside the building could be heard at one point during the defense closing, but it wasn’t clear from inside the courtroom what they were saying.Rittenhouse’s mother, Wendy Rittenhouse, listened intently in the courtroom.Supporters have hailed Rittenhouse as a hero who took a stand against lawlessness; foes have branded him a vigilante.Binger began his closing arguments by questioning whether Rittenhouse was genuinely trying to help.The prosecutor noted that Rittenhouse had ammunition capable of traveling the length of five football fields and passing through cars, and asked the jury: “Why do you need 30 rounds of full metal jacket (ammo) to protect a building?”But Richards said Rittenhouse, who worked as a lifeguard in Kenosha and helped clean up graffiti before the shootings, “feels for this community” and “came down here trying to help, to see the damage.”The defense attorney branded the trial a “political case” brought by prosecutors who he said need someone to blame for the violence. “Kyle Rittenhouse is not that individual,” Richards told the jury.Earlier Monday, Judge Bruce Schroeder dismissed a count of possession of a dangerous weapon by a person under 18, a misdemeanor that had appeared to be among the likeliest of the charges to net a conviction. It carries by up to nine months in jail.The defense argued that Wisconsin law has an exception related to the length of a weapon’s barrel. After prosecutors conceded Rittenhouse’s rifle was not short-barreled, the judge threw out the charge.Perhaps in recognition of weaknesses in their case, prosecutors asked the judge to let the jury consider several lesser charges if they acquit him on the original counts. Schroeder agreed to do so as he delivered some 36 pages of legal instructions to the jury.In his instructions, the judge said that to accept Rittenhouse’s claim of self-defense, the jury must find that he believed there was an unlawful threat to him and that the amount of force he used was reasonable and necessary.After closing arguments, names were to be drawn to determine which 12 of the 18 jurors who heard testimony would deliberate, with the rest dismissed as alternates.With a verdict near, Gov.

But President Emmanuel Macron ordered a change to the colour of the French flag to find echoes of heroism in France's past.Keen-eyed observers can see that the French red-white-and-blue tricolour flying above the Elysee Palace and also placed behind Macron at news conferences and speeches now has a darker navy blue rather than the previous bright blue.The navy blue colour marks a return to tradition -- it had been then president Valery Giscard d'Estaing who switched the brighter blue in 1976 so that it matched the colour of the European flag, which displays yellow stars on a blue background.The change had been made on the flags placed behind Macron at speeches from 2018 and then on those flying from the Elysee and other presidential buildings from 2020, a presidential official, who asked not to be named, told AFP on Monday.The official said that the navy blue colour "evokes the memory" of the heroes who fought in the French Revolution, the trenches of World War I and in the Resistance during World War II.The change has finally been noticed after being revealed in a book "Elysee Confidential" published this Autumn by journalists, Eliot Blondet and Paul Larrouturou.They reported that the initiative came from the head of operations at the Elysee Arnaud Jolens, whom the journalists interviewed for their book. The change cost a symbolic 5,000 euros."Giscard changed this blue for aesthetic reasons during integration with Europe, but the flag that all the presidents took along with them ever since was not the real French flag," Jolens is quoted as saying.The Elysee official also pointed out that the flag on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris had always had the navy blue.France on January 1 takes on the rotating EU presidency under Macron, a pro-European, while he faces re-election battle in April.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-shades-of-blue-french-prez-macron-makes-subtle-change-in-national-flag-101637016531376.html

16-11-2021||World||Biden celebrates $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill signing||Battered by critics and dire opinion polls, President Joe Biden signed into law the biggest US infrastructure revamp in more than half a century at a rare bipartisan celebration in the White House on Monday.The $1.2 trillion package will fix bridges and roads, change out unhealthy lead water pipes, build an electric vehicle charging network, and expand broadband internet. It is the most significant government investment of the kind since the creation of the national highways network in the 1950s."We've heard countless speeches... but today we're finally getting this done," Biden told hundreds of invitees on the White House South Lawn."So my message to the American people is this: America is moving again and your life is going to change for the better."Most of the crowd were Democrats but there was also a visible handful of Republicans. Notable among the Democrats were senators Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin, two moderates who have warred with more leftwing members of the party, slowing down Biden's agenda.The bill is "proof that Democrats and Republicans can come together to deliver results," Biden said. "Let's believe in one another and let's believe in America."Infrastructure spending is popular, but the goal eluded Biden's predecessor Donald Trump for four years, turning his administration's frequent promises of an imminent "infrastructure week" into a running joke.Even now, Biden had to fight for months to get his squabbling Democratic Party to vote, risking a humiliating failure.Democrats only narrowly control a bitterly divided Congress, but in a scarce moment of cooperation they were ultimately joined by a significant number of Republicans in the Senate and a symbolic handful in the House."We agreed this would be a truly bipartisan process," Senator Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio, told the White House gathering. "This should be the beginning of a renewed effort to work together on big issues facing our country."- Brutal poll numbers -The feelgood moment may be hard to sustain.Biden's ratings are in a downward spiral, with the latest Washington Post-ABC poll showing just 41 percent approving. Most worrying for the White House, support is ebbing away not just among the crucial independent voters but his own Democratic base.And despite the reaching out by some Republicans, the bulk of the opposition party is in little mood to declare a truce.Trump, who is widely expected to seek to return to the White House in the 2024 election, has savaged the 13 Republicans in the House of Representatives who voted alongside the Democrats.He says Republicans who crossed the aisle should be "ashamed" and are not real Republicans.Hard-right Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, an especially vocal Trump booster, called them "traitors." She tweeted out office phone numbers of the 13 fellow Republicans, some of whom reported getting torrents of violent abuse.The pressure is also on in the Senate, where Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who voted for the bill, was among the prominent figures keeping away from the South Lawn celebration.Portman, meanwhile, was freer to make generous comments toward Biden because he has already announced he is not seeking reelection.With Republicans almost certain to make gains in midterm congressional elections in just under a year, Biden's already tenuous grip on Washington faces growing strains.But the White House hopes the bill signing will give Biden, who was due to hold a video-link summit with China's President Xi Jinping later Monday, new momentum.Still pending is a $1.75 trillion package for childcare, education and other social spending that Biden says amounts to a historic effort to redress social inequalities.Again, internal party divisions are holding that up and the proposal has zero Republican support. However, Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told the White House gathering that "hopefully this week we will be passing" the bill.After a first 10 months in power dominated by Covid-19 and congressional wrangling, Biden is "frustrated by the negativity and the infighting," his press secretary, Jen Psaki, told reporters.However, Biden's infrastructure sales pitch will aim to change the tune.Biden will travel Tuesday to New Hampshire to visit a bridge set for infrastructure funding and Detroit on Wednesday to meet union workers. Psaki said "the president wants to spend some sustained time out there communicating."sms/bgs||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-celebrates-1-2-trillion-infrastructure-bill-signing-101637015285614.html
16-11-2021||World||Roads, transit, internet: What's in Biden's infrastructure plan||The $1 trillion infrastructure plan that President Joe Biden signed into law Monday has money for roads, bridges, ports, rail transit, safe water, the power grid, broadband internet and more.The plan promises to reach almost every corner of the country. It's a historic investment that the president has compared to the building of the transcontinental railroad and Interstate Highway System. The White House is projecting that the investments will add, on average, about 2 million jobs per year over the coming decade.The bill cleared the House on a 228-206 vote Nov. 5, ending weeks of intraparty negotiations in which liberal Democrats insisted the legislation be tied to a larger social spending bill — an effort to press more moderate Democrats to support both.The Senate passed the legislation on a 69-30 vote in August after rare bipartisan negotiations, and the House kept that compromise intact. Thirteen House Republicans voted for the bill, giving Democrats more than enough votes to overcome a handful of defections from progressives.A breakdown of the bill that became law Monday:Roads and bridgesThe bill would provide $110 billion to repair the nation's aging highways, bridges and roads. According to the White House, 173,000 total miles or nearly 280,000 kilometers of America’s highways and major roads and 45,000 bridges are in poor condition. The almost $40 billion for bridges is the single largest dedicated bridge investment since the construction of the national highway system, according to the Biden administration.Public transitThe $39 billion for public transit in the legislation would expand transportation systems, improve accessibility for people with disabilities and provide dollars to state and local governments to buy zero-emission and low-emission buses. The Transportation Department estimates that the current repair backlog is more than 24,000 buses, 5,000 rail cars, 200 stations and thousands of miles of track and power systems.Passenger and freight railTo reduce Amtrak's maintenance backlog, which has worsened since Superstorm Sandy nine years ago, the bill would provide $66 billion to improve the rail service's Northeast Corridor (457 miles, 735 km), as well as other routes. It’s less than the $80 billion originally sought by Biden — who famously rode Amtrak from Delaware to Washington during his time in the Senate — but it would be the largest federal investment in passenger rail service since Amtrak was founded 50 years ago.Electric vehiclesThe bill would spend $7.5 billion for electric vehicle charging stations, which the administration says are critical to accelerating the use of electric vehicles to curb climate change. It would also provide $5 billion for the purchase of electric school buses and hybrids, reducing reliance on school buses that run on diesel fuel.Internet accessThe legislation's $65 billion for broadband access would aim to improve internet services for rural areas, low-income families and tribal communities. Most of the money would be made available through grants to states.Modernizing the electric gridTo protect against the power outages that have become more frequent in recent years, the bill would spend $65 billion to improve the reliability and resiliency of the power grid. It would also boost carbon capture technologies and more environmentally friendly electricity sources like clean hydrogen.AirportsThe bill would spend $25 billion to improve runways, gates and taxiways at airports and to improve terminals. It would also improve aging air traffic control towers.Water and wastewaterThe legislation would spend $55 billion on water and wastewater infrastructure. It has $15 billion to replace lead pipes and $10 billion to address water contamination from polyfluoroalkyl substances — chemicals that were used in the production of Teflon and have also been used in firefighting foam, water-repellent clothing and many other items.Paying for itThe five-year spending package would be paid for by tapping $210 billion in unspent COVID-19 relief aid and $53 billion in unemployment insurance aid some states have halted, along with an array of smaller pots of money, like petroleum reserve sales and spectrum auctions for 5G services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/roads-transit-internet-what-s-in-biden-s-infrastructure-plan-101637014932463.html
16-11-2021||World||France warns Russia as EU prepares sanctions on Belarus||France told Russia on Monday NATO would be prepared to defend the sovereignty of Ukraine, near where NATO says Moscow has been staging a troop buildup, while Western leaders sought to tackle a migrants crisis on the eastern borders of the European Union.The European Union agreed to step up sanctions against Belarus over thousands of migrants stranded in freezing forests on its borders with the EU. Belarus, a close Russian ally, said assertions it had fuelled the crisis were "absurd".Speaking by telephone to Russian President Vladimir Putin as part of a flurry of conversations between Western leaders and Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, the French leader spoke of his strong concern over the situation on Ukraine's borders."Our willingness to defend Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity was reiterated by the president," an adviser to Macron told reporters of the conversation Macron initiated.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov earlier dismissed as "wrong" a U.S. State Department statement that the Belarus border crisis was meant to distract attention from increased Russian military activity close to Ukraine, another former Soviet republic.The EU is seeking to stop what it says is a policy by Belarus to push migrants towards it to avenge earlier sanctions over a crackdown on protests last year against veteran leader Alexander Lukashenko's contested re-election.Belarus and Russia have both repeatedly denied any role.NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said earlier on Monday NATO did not want to speculate on Russia's intentions on Ukraine, while adding: "We see an unusual concentration of troops, and we know that Russia has been willing to use these types of military capabilities before to conduct aggressive actions against Ukraine."US ConcernThe US Defense Department said it continued to see Russia concentrate forces along with unusual military activity near its border with Ukraine. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said the build-up was concerning and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin would meet his Ukrainian counterpart on Thursday.Russian-backed separatists took control of Ukraine's eastern Donbass region in 2014 in a conflict that has rumbled on. Moscow also annexed Crimea from Ukraine earlier that year after the former Soviet republic sought closer ties with the EU.Moscow claims the Black Sea waters around Crimea, although most countries consider the peninsula still Ukrainian.In the Kremlin's readout of the call with Macron, Putin said large-scale military drills staged by the United States and its allies in the Back Sea were a "provocation"."This is increasing tensions in relations between Russia and NATO," the Kremlin said.The two leaders also discussed the migrants crisis. Macron's adviser said they had agreed on the need for a deescalation while the Kremlin reiterated Russia's insistence that the EU discuss it directly with Minsk.Migrants - mostly from Iraq and Afghanistan - began appearing on Belarus' land borders with the EU this year, trying to cross into member states Lithuania, Latvia and Poland via routes not used before.The top EU diplomat, Josep Borrell, said a fifth package of sanctions had been agreed by EU foreign ministers and would be finalised in the coming days. They would target airlines, travel agencies and individuals involved in "this illegal push of migrants", he said.Latvia said on Monday it had deployed 3,000 troops for a previously unannounced military exercise near the border. It, Lithuania and Poland make up the eastern flank of the EU and NATO, while Ukraine is not a member of either western group.Several hundred migrants, some throwing stones, made a new attempt on Monday to cross the border near the Polish village of Starzyna, but were forced back, Polish police said on Twitter.German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Lukashenko discussed humanitarian aid for refugees and migrants by telephone, a German government spokesperson said.The talks are the first known contact between the Belarusian president and a Western leader since last year's presidential election in Belarus triggered mass protests by demonstrators accusing Lukashenko of electoral fraud, a charge he denies.Merkel and Lukashenko agreed to continue their exchange, the spokesperson said, but gave no sign a breakthrough had been made. Merkel has spoken twice to Putin in recent days.AirlinesMiddle East travel agencies working together with operators in Belarus provided tourist visas to thousands of people in recent months, a Reuters investigation showed.The EU's executive, the European Commision, said it was looking into whether other airlines should face sanctions after the bloc banned Belarus' state-owned carrier Belavia from its skies and airports. Ireland said EU aircraft leasing contracts with Belavia would also end.Lukashenko said Belarus was trying to persuade migrants to go home but that none of them wanted to return. Minsk would retaliate against any new EU sanctions, he said.The EU has been stepping up sanctions on Belarus for months. Curbs already in place include blacklisting of Lukashenko, his son and 165 other Belarusian officials, as well as restrictions on trade in potash, an important export.In Washington, the White House said it was in close contact with EU allies to hold the government of Belarus accountable.The Kremlin, which has sent strategic bombers to patrol over Belarus, said Putin spoke to Lukashenko on Sunday and Moscow had no plans to reroute gas flows away from Belarus despite Minsk threatening to cut transit to Europe through the Yamal pipeline.At least eight people have died along the 200-km (124-mile)long land border between Poland and Belarus, including from cold and exhaustion. The sparsely populated area of lakes, swamps and forests is becoming even more hostile to people trying to keep warm around bonfires through the cold November nights.The EU's Borrell urged Warsaw to allow humanitarian aid on the frontier, where Poland has deployed some 20,000 police, border guards and soldiers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-warns-russia-as-eu-prepares-sanctions-on-belarus-101637014479540.html
16-11-2021||World||Five teens hurt in shooting near US school in Colorado||A shooting near a US high school left five teenagers wounded on Monday, police said.Officers in Aurora, Colorado were called to a park near Central High School where they found five people aged between 14 and 17 had been hurt, the Aurora Police Department said."Unknown suspect who is no longer on scene," the police said on Twitter. "5 total people have been transported to the hospital."Incident did not happen inside of the school but just north at Nome Park."Local television stations broadcast aerial footage of the park, showing law enforcement officers walking around.Also visible were nearby houses, one of which appeared to have incident tape around it.The local CBS affiliate reported on its website that there were emergency vehicles in the car park of Aurora Central High School, and several adults had gathered outside the school, many of them talking on phones.Colorado is no stranger to gun violence, having suffered two of the most infamous mass shootings in US history.In 1999, two boys shot and killed 12 classmates and a teacher at Columbine High School.Then in 2012, a heavily armed man stormed a movie theater in Aurora, murdering 12. The gunman is now serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole.In March of this year, a gunman killed 10 people, including a police officer at a grocery store in Boulder County, 50 kilometers (30 miles) outside Denver.After a year spent largely learning online, US schools have returned to the classroom, reviving the fear of on-campus shootings, with multiple small-scale incidents reported in recent weeks.More than 256,000 students have been exposed to gun violence in US schools the Columbine killings, according to data compiled by The Washington Post.The figure includes those caught up in the violence, such as witnesses, and those forced to evacuate educational institutions when gunfire erupted.According to a Post database, there were 29 school shootings in the United States in 2018 and 27 in 2019. The Post figures do not include shootings at colleges or universities, suicides or accidental discharges.The deadliest recent school shooting in the United States took place in 2018, when 17 people were killed by a former student at a high school in Parkland, Florida.Every mass shooting provokes anguished calls for gun reform in the US.Tighter gun control is overwhelmingly popular with Americans -- but Republicans have long stood against what some view as any infringement on their right to bear arms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/five-teens-hurt-in-shooting-near-us-school-in-colorado-101637014290597.html
16-11-2021||India||New US special representative for Afghanistan meets NSA Doval, foreign secretary Shringla||New Delhi The new US special representative for Afghanistan, Thomas West, met senior Indian officials during his first visit to the country on Tuesday and discussed the regional security situation and ways to provide humanitarian aid to the Afghan people. West travelled to New Delhi after participating in a meeting of the “extended troika” in Islamabad on November 11 along with his counterparts from Pakistan, China and Russia, and holding talks with Russia’s special representative for Afghanistan, Zamir Kabulov, in Moscow on Monday. People familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity that West met National Security Adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval and foreign secretary Harsh Shringla for discussions that focussed on current developments in Afghanistan and regional security issues. Among the matters that figured in the meetings were the regional security dialogue on Afghanistan hosted by India on November 10, the movement of people in and out of Afghanistan, the need to coordinate global efforts to provide humanitarian assistance to the Afghan people, and other bilateral and global issues of mutual interest. West briefed the Indian side on his discussions in Pakistan and Russia. Before travelling to the region, West held consultations with top British officials and representatives of the European Union and NATO in Brussels on developments and priorities in Afghanistan and the way forward in the war-torn country. West was appointed to the post last month after the former special representative, Zalmay Khalilzad, stepped down following severe criticism of his handling of negotiations with the Taliban and the chaotic fall of the Ashraf Ghani government in Kabul in mid-August. Following his meeting with the Russian special representative on Monday, West tweeted that he had discussed “shared interests in Afghanistan and [the] need for [the] Taliban to fulfil commitments to [the] international community”. A statement issued after the “extended troika” meeting on November 11 had expressed concern at the “severe humanitarian and economic situation” in Afghanistan and called on the Taliban to ensure unhindered humanitarian access. The statement also called on the Taliban to “cut ties with all international terrorist groups, dismantle and eliminate them in a decisive manner, and to deny space to any terrorist organisation”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-us-special-representative-for-afghanistan-meets-nsa-doval-foreign-secretary-shringla-101637086471159.html
16-11-2021||India||Auditing not feared, seen as a key tool now: PM Modi||There was a time when auditing was seen with suspicion and fear but that mindset has changed as they are now seen as important tools for value addition to governance, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Tuesday.The mindset of Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) Vs Government has changed and they are no longer viewed as adversarial to the government and bureaucrats, he added. “There was a time when auditing was seen with suspicion and dread. CAG Vs Government had become a common belief and babus (government officials) used to think that CAG finds faults in everything. However, this mindset has changed. Today, the audit is seen as an important part of value addition,” the Prime Minister, who was speaking at an event organised by the CAG to mark the first edition of ‘Audit Diwas’, said.“While analysing the government’s work, the CAG has an outsider’s viewpoint and we make systematic improvements with what you (CAG) tell us. We see it as cooperation in the long term,” he added. Modi also stressed on the importance of data and reports compiled by the CAG, saying that it will “dictate history” in the future and provide a roadmap for governance to future governments.“Earlier, information was transmitted through stories. History was written through stories. But today in the 21st century, data is information, and in the coming times, our history will also be seen and understood through data. In the future, data will dictate history,” he added. Citing an example of the banking sector, the Prime Minister took potshots at previous governments for not being transparent in their work culture. “Due to lack of transparency in the country’s banking sector earlier, various practices used to take place. As a result, the non-performing assets (NPAs) kept rising. The NPAs were brushed under the carpet. But we brought out the truth of previous governments before the country with complete honesty. Fairness and transparency play a key role in our personal and professional lives. Only when we identify the problem, can we find a solution to it,” he said.Modi said the government has made reforms to boost transparency and easy functioning. “We took your (CAG’s) concerns positively and made decisions to monetise unused and underused elements. And these decisions are now showing results in the growing economy,” he added.Modi emphasised that reforms like online applications for contactless customs, automatic renewals, faceless assessments and service delivery have ended the unnecessary interference of the government.“Today, we are making such a system in which the idea of ‘Sarkar Sarvam’, i.e interference of the government, is decreasing and your work is also getting easier,” he said. Lauding the CAG for use of geo-spatial data and remote sensing in audit mechanisms, Modi said: “The stronger and scientific the auditing will be, the stronger our system will be.” “While most institutions lose their relevance in three-four decades, the CAG has become stronger, more mature with time and we can say that it is an asset, a heritage for the country. The CAG is an institution that has grown in importance and has created a legacy with passage of time. Every generation needs to cherish it and make it useful for other generations,” he said.Speaking at the event, CAG G C Murmu said the federal auditor was developing an audit process management application which will include all audit processes, streams and activities, and shall also serve as the primary system of records for the entire chain of audit. The Prime Minister also unveiled a statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel at the CAG premises. Audit Diwas is celebrated to mark the historic origins of the institution of CAG and the contribution it has made to the governance, transparency and accountability over the past several years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/auditing-not-feared-seen-as-a-key-tool-now-pmmodi-101637086469807.html
16-11-2021||India||Ahmedabad civic body begins the removal of all non-veg food stalls||Ahmedabad The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) on Tuesday began the removal of all carts and stalls selling non-vegetarian food from the main roads, a day after chief minister Bhupendra Patel said his government had no problem with what people ate. The AMC is the fifth civic body in the state to issue such directives.According to a press release, a large number of roadside carts selling non-vegetarian food and clothes were removed from Jodhpur, Satellite, ISCON Cross Road and SG Highway by the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation’s Estate Department on Tuesday, saying that they were “obstructing the smooth movement of traffic”. On Monday the AMC issued an oral order, banning stalls selling non-vegetarian food from public roads and those operating within 100-metre radius of schools and religious places.“The smell near these stalls could be nauseating to the extent that one had to cover one’s nose” and therefore, action should be taken considering the impact it has on people’s health, the AMC’s town planning committee chairman, Devang Dani, had said.Earlier, the municipal corporations of Vadodara, Rajkot, Junagadh and Bhavnagar,all ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), ordered shopkeepers and hawkers to cover non-vegetarian food, including eggs, saying that they hurt religious sentiments of Hindus.Reacting to the ban, BJP’s president for Gujarat, CR Paatil, said:  “We (the BJP) are not targeting eggs or non-veg joints. There is no such plan of the government either. We believe people have a right to have their food choices... Nobody would be disturbed just because he sells eggs or non-veg food. Only cleanliness and hygiene should be maintained. It was the decision of some municipal corporations.”On Monday, CM Patel said that people were free to eat whatever they want to and the “decision about removing the non-veg and egg stalls was taken by the individual municipal corporations”.“As for the state Government, we have no issues with the food choices of people, veg or non-veg, we have nothing to do with it. People only need to ensure that the quality of food is proper and does not harm their health,” he said, adding that: “The municipal corporations may remove any kind of stalls if they are an obstacle to traffic or are encroachments -- but this has nothing to do with veg or non-veg.” Leader of Opposition at the Vadodara Municipal Corporation Ami Rawat said, “The move is illegal. Instead of implementing the Street Vendors Act, 2014, they are harassing small vendors who are already in a bad state after the lockdown.”Meanwhile, the Laari-Galla Ladat Samiti  -- a committee comprising 1.7 million street vendors across Gujarat -- has threatened to launch an agitation against the move and demanded that the Street Vendors Act, 2014, be immediately implemented in the state. “We agree that there should not be such eateries near religious places, but summarily removing street vendors without providing any alternative arrangements was illegal and violated the Street Vendors Act,” said Ashok Punjabi, convenor of Laari-Galla Ladat Samiti of Ahmedabad, which is affiliated to INTUC.“Instead of financially helping these vendors, who suffered the most during the Covid pandemic, the corporations are taking away their source of livelihood,” he added. Speaking about the legal position, eminent human rights lawyer Anand Yagnik said, “The Street Vendors Act supersedes the Bombay Provincial Municipal Corporation Act, under which all corporations in Gujarat fall, and it does not discriminate what you sell. It is supposed to take care of the livelihoods of the street vendors, while also maintaining equitable principles of urban planning.”“What they (the civic bodies) are doing is unconstitutional. And they are hitting at the very vitals of the mercantile ethos of Gujarat, which is inclusive, multi-cultural and so multi-cuisine and cosmopolitan. They are not only damaging the fabric of Gujarat but also of the country,” Yagnik asserted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahmedabad-civic-body-begins-the-removal-of-all-non-veg-food-stalls-101637086409928.html
16-11-2021||India||India bolsters sea power with new assets, armed drones in the works||NEW DELHI: The Indian Navy will next week commission a modern locally built destroyer and a submarine constructed in the country with French collaboration to strengthen its capabilities amid changing power dynamics in the Indian Ocean Region even as a proposed procurement of armed drones from the US is set to come up for a critical approval shortly, navy vice chief Vice Admiral SN Ghormade said on Tuesday. India plans to induct 30 Predator drones, 10 each for the navy, air force and army, in a deal estimated to be worth $ 3 billion. Defence minister Rajnath Singh will commission the stealth guided missile destroyer Visakhapatnam in Mumbai on November 21 followed by the induction of a French-designed Kalvari class diesel-electric attack submarine, Vela, on November 25 at a ceremony to be presided over by navy chief Admiral Karambir Singh. “The commissioning of Visakhapatnam and Vela are major milestones and showcase indigenous capacity to build complex combat platforms. This will enhance our capacity and fire power to address threats both in the above water and underwater domains,” Ghormade said. Both platforms have been built at Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Ltd in Mumbai. Visakhapatnam is the first warship of the navy’s Project-15B under which three more warships will be delivered by 2025. Vela is the fourth of the six Kalvari class submarines being constructed in the country with technology transfer from French firm Naval Group under a ₹23,562-crore programme called Project 75. The remaining two submarines will be commissioned in two years. “Global and regional balance of power is shifting rapidly and the region of most rapid change is undoubtedly the Indian Ocean Region. Continuous efforts are on to ensure that our force levels grow progressively to enhance the capability of the Indian Navy to meet the emerging challenges,” the vice chief said. The commissioning of Visakhapatnam, armed with a variety of locally built weapons and sensors, will reaffirm India’s presence among an elite group of nations with capability to design and build advanced warships, he said. Vela is a potent platform and very few countries possess the capability to build submarines, Ghormade said.While it may seem that there is a spate of new commissioning of ships , these are all overdue accretions, said maritime affairs expert Rear Admiral Sudarshan Shrikhande (retd). “Given the threats and tasks of the Indian Navy, much more needs to be done, especially for indigenisation. One hopes that not only greater budgetary support but more Atmanirbharta can be ensured in the years to come,” Shrikhande added.India is also pursuing a project (P-75I) worth ₹40,000 crore for building six more advanced submarines in the country under the government’s strategic partnership (SP) model to bolster the Indian Navy’s underwater force levels and counter the rapid expansion of China’s submarine fleet. The Indian strategic partners cleared to collaborate with the foreign players are Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited and L&T. The foreign yards they can team up with for the project are the French Naval Group, German conglomerate Thyssenkrupp Marine Systems, Russia’s Rubin Design Bureau, Spain’s Navantia and South Korea’s Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Company. On the proposed Predator purchase, Ghormade said “healthy discussions” were on among stakeholders and the case was progressing well. He said the proposal to buy the armed drones was likely to be taken up by the defence acquisition council (DAC) --- India’s apex procurement body --- in a short while. DAC approval for the drones is likely to be sought within the current financial year, HT has learnt.The Indian Navy last year leased a pair of MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones (an unarmed variant of the Predators manufactured by General Atomics) from the US to boost its intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities. The MQ-9Bs have helped the navy keep a close watch on the Indian Ocean at a time when it has stepped up surveillance in the region to check China’s ambitions. The commissioning of Visakhapatnam and Vela will be followed by the launch of Sandhayak in early December, the first of four large survey vessels to be built by Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers (GRSE), Kolkata, Ghormade said. A ship’s launch marks a significant milestone in its construction and refers to the vessel entering water for the first time. The contract for building the four ships was signed between the defence ministry and GRSE in October 2018. “The ships will come with new generation hydrographic equipment and advanced technical capabilities for collecting oceanographic and geophysical data in Indian Ocean Region,” he added. Sandhayak is likely to be delivered to the navy in October 2022. The Indian Navy’s latest frigate, Tushil, was last month launched at the Yantar Shipyard in Kaliningrad, with Russia preparing to deliver two new warships to India in 2023. Tushil is part of an over $2.5-billion deal with Russia for four more Krivak/Talwar class stealth frigates for the Indian Navy, two of which are being constructed at the Yantar Shipyard and the remaining two will be built at the Goa Shipyard Limited (GSL) with technology transfer from Russia, which is India’s top arms supplier. Tushil is expected to be commissioned into the Indian Navy in mid-2023 followed by its sister ship in 2023-end. GSL is expected to deliver the two frigates by 2026-27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-bolsters-sea-power-with-new-assets-armed-drones-in-the-works-101637086355561.html
16-11-2021||India||CBI autonomous body, Centre not accountable for it, SC told||New Delhi: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is an “autonomous” body, not controlled or regulated by the Union government, attorney general (AG) KK Venugopal submitted before the Supreme Court on Tuesday while seeking dismissal of West Bengal government’s petition for debarring CBI from lodging cases in the state without its consent or prior approval. Representing the Centre, Venugopal told a bench, headed by justice L Nageswara Rao, that CBI operates under the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act (DSPE), and that it also derives its authority to register cases under the same law. “CBI is constituted under the DSPE Act and its officers have been taking actions under this Act. The Union of India has nothing to do with it... CBI is an autonomous institution operating under a parliamentary law,” the AG said in his bid to emphasise that the central government cannot take accountability or responsibility for what CBI does. He pointed out that West Bengal government’s suit was asking For all relief only against CBI; its petition pleaded for a restraint on the agency against filing any fresh case without state’s approval as well as annulment of 12 cases registered by CBI. “All these prayers have nothing to do with the Union of India. The entirety of plaint is on CBI and the Union of India had nothing to do with these cases... Union of India is not a necessary party. CBI is a necessary party. This suit cannot be maintained against the Union of India when all the reliefs claimed are against CBI,” the A-G told the bench, which also included justices BR Gavai and BV Nagarathna. According to Venugopal, it is the central vigilance commission (CVC) which has been tasked with superintendence over CBI, and the CVC Act makes it clear that there cannot be any interference with the investigations conducted by the agency. “Even CVC cannot interfere with the manner of investigation. Therefore, registration of cases is by an autonomous body and whatever superintendence is there, that power is with the CVC. Union of India has no control,” said the A-G. He added that a state is entitled under Article 131 of the Constitution to file a suit in the Supreme Court against another state or the central government but the West Bengal government’s suit is only about CBI. “Since the suit otherwise would not have been maintainable, the Union of India has been made a party. These reliefs cannot be claimed against the Union of India. How can I grant these reliefs?” asked the AG. Venugopal said that the suit should be dismissed straightaway for being non-maintainable against the central government. Opposition parties, including the Congress and TMC, have attacked the Centre for using the federal agencies to target them and using ordinance route to bypass Parliament. West Bengal is among seven states, that have withdrawn the general consent for the CBI to carry out investigations in their jurisdiction. Other states are Maharashtra, Punjab, Chhattisgarh Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Mizoram. The central agency has to seek permission to carry out investigation in these states on case-to-case basis, as per DSPE (Delhi Special Police Establishment) Act. The 12 FIRs cited by the state government were filed between November 2018 and June 2021. The cases involve a variety of charges, including corruption, abuse of official position, forgery, criminal breach of trust, death due to rash and negligent driving and criminal misconduct. In some of these cases, employees of Central government establishments have been named as accused. Appearing for the West Bengal government, senior advocate Sidharth Luthra took exception to the A-G’s submissions, arguing that the central government should not even get an audience from the bench since they have chosen not to file any vakalatnama (formal communication for appearance in the case through a lawyer) or a written submission in response to the suit. “The Supreme Court rules are clear that they had to file a vakalatnama and a written statement within 28 days. They have done nothing. Today, they don’t have a right to be heard. As per the SC rules, this suit should be allowed right away,” contended Luthra. Also representing the state government, senior advocate Biswajit Bhattacharya sought to contest Venugopal’s arguments, saying that the very existence of CBI is by an approval of the central government under the DSPE Act, which has a deep and pervasive control over the agency. He added that various provisions in the DSPE Act clarify CBI and the central government were intertwined. At this, the court asked the central government to comply with the procedure and file its vakalatnama, and fixed the matter for a hearing after three weeks. In August this year, the Mamata Banerjee government filed the original suit in the Supreme Court to debar CBI from conducting probes in the state without prior approval of the government. Underlining that the TMC government had in November 2018, withdrawn general consent to carry out a probe in the territory of the state, the suit maintained that registration of 12 cases by the central agency despite withdrawal of consent was an instance of “constitutional overreach” by the Union government. The state said that CBI has no inherent jurisdiction to conduct a probe in any part of the state, including railway areas, till the time it obtains a prior sanction. Claiming that the agency has been exercising its powers in an “unconstitutional manner”, the suit said the registration of cases by CBI was an encroachment on the legal rights of the state. The plea demanded quashing of all 12 cases registered by CBI and to restrain the agency from lodging any fresh cases. On September 6, the court directed its registry to issue a formal notice to the Centre on the suit, seeking a reply from the Union government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-autonomous-body-centre-not-accountable-for-it-sc-told-101637086297401.html

16-11-2021||India||Civil aviation ministry allows airlines to serve food, magazines in all domestic flights||The Union ministry of civil aviation on Tuesday announced that it has allowed airlines to serve meals on all domestic flights. Airline carriers were not allowed to serve meals in flights that have a duration of less than two hours since April 15, 2021, in view of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.“The airlines, operating flights on domestic sectors may provide meal services on board, without restriction on duration of the flight,” news agency PTI reported citing the ministry’s order.Along with food services, the ministry has also permitted the resumption of magazines and other reading materials to the passengers, according to the order. The ministry noted that the decision to resume food services and magazines has been made as the “Covid caseload” has decreased due to the "proper implementation of appropriate Covid behaviour protocol", the PTI report showed.Also read | Airlines may resume food on flights with less than 2-hour durationThe announcement came a few days after the Union ministry of health and family welfare on Saturday (November 13) informed the civil aviation ministry that meals can be served in flights that have less than two hours of journey time, according to a PTI report. “The health ministry has now informed that serving food on flights of less than two hours can be resumed and that the crew members need not wear coveralls but should continue to wear gloves, masks and face shields,” PTI reported.The ban on serving foods in flights that fly for less than two hours was implemented in April this year, during the second wave of Covid-19 infections in the country. However, on flights that had a journey time of more than two hours, food was allowed conditional that the tray, plates, cutlery should also be disposable and none should be reused.Also beverages like tea, coffee, alcoholic and non-alcoholic were also allowed only in disposable cans and bottles. All crew members in the flight were asked to wear a fresh set of gloves after every meal or beverage served.Earlier in August 2020, the government had allowed the carriers to serve food under certain conditions. “Airlines may serve pre-packed snacks/meals/pre-packed beverages on domestic flights depending on the duration of flight,” the ministry had said.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/civil-aviation-ministry-allows-airlines-to-serve-food-magazines-in-all-domestic-flights-101637084092046.html
16-11-2021||India||10 held as CBI raids 77 places in crackdown on child porn||At least 10 people were detained by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Tuesday during raids at 77 locations across 14 states and Union territories, to crackdown on sexual abuse and circulation of child pornography material, officials familiar with the matter said. As many as 23 first information reports (FIRs) were registered against 83 accused persons, in the last two days, for allegedly posting and circulating child sexual exploitation material (CSEM) through various social media platforms. Police are also probing the role of several nationals across 100 countries in the case, the officials cited above said.According to one of the FIRs, the accused people, based in different Indian cities and various foreign countries, are part of multiple syndicates “indulging in storing, circulating and viewing CSEM”. The FIR, a copy of which HT has seen, also said that the accused were disseminating CSEM by way of sharing links, videos, pictures, texts, posts and hosting of such content on social media groups/platforms and third-party storage/hosting platforms. CBI spokesperson R C Joshi said there are more than 50 groups having more than 5,000 offenders. “Many of these groups also have the involvement of foreign nationals. It has been initially learnt that nationals from around 100 countries spread across various continents may be involved in the matter. The CBI is coordinating with sister agencies through formal and informal channels,” he said. An official, on condition of anonymity, said that some of the countries where these individuals are based include Pakistan, Bangladesh, the US, the UK, Canada, France and Saudi Arabia. Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Bihar, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh were among states where searches were held, Joshi said. In Odisha’s Dhenkanal, CBI sleuths faced resistance after a group of people attacked the team for raiding the house of one Mithun Nayak, a security guard in a hospital, one of the officials cited above said on condition of anonymity.“As we took his mobile phone, we suddenly came under attack from women. We were first locked in a room and then dragged outside. The women began beating us with wooden planks,” the official said. The CBI team was finally rescued by a team of policemen from Dhenkanal Town police station. “The CBI team had not informed us about the raid. We managed to get them out of the place,” Dhenkanal SP K Siva Subramani said. Officials claimed Nayak was a part of WhatsApp group which dealt with child sexual abuse videos. The house of an autodriver, Manoj Das, in Binayakpur village under Agarpada police station of Bhadrak district was also raided by another team. Das, officials said, has been accused of sharing explicit videos of minors. Similarly,Anil Majhi of Keutanguan village under Goleipur panchayat of Jajpur district was also interrogated on charges of circulating such videos. In Andhra Pradesh, one person named T Krishna Mohanwas arrested from Tirupati in Chittoor district for uploading child porn-related videos on social media and selling the same to a third party, an official said on condition of anonymity.Mohan was allegedly involved in luring children into the flesh trade and videographing the same, the official added. In Madhya Pradesh’s Shivpuri, the CBI raided the home of one Rahul Rana, a resident of Pichhore, accusing him of running a child pornography site.The raids were conducted by the agency and its special unit, Online Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation Prevention/ Investigation (OCSAE), which deals with matters pertaining to the online child sexual abuse and exploitation. The unit often gets information from embassies and overseas federal probe agencies, about organised rackets related to online child sexual abuse and exploitation. The CBI is also the nodal agency for the Interpol, which has an International Child Sexual Exploitation (ICSE) image and video database, to allow investigators from member countries to share data on cases of child sexual abuse. Used by 64 countries, including India, the ICSE has helped identify 23,500 victims and 10,752 offenders worldwide from 2.3 million images and videos in the database. ICSE also has a provision to share data, both in an open network that can be accessed by all countries as well as with specific countries. According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), 2020 witnessed a 400 percent rise in cyber crimes committed against children when compared to the previous year, with most cases pertaining to publishing or transmitting of materials depicting children in sexually explicit acts. “While the problem is huge, what needs to be done is to sensitise the police about the issue. If a person files a complaint, he/she is haunted with questions like where did you get this? How did you get this? Also, there is an urgent need to come down on some apps, where one gets these horrible ads which instigate children to join another site where they become prey to online abuse,” Bharti Ali, co-founder, HAQ Centre for Child Rights, said.Child sexual abuse is punishable in India under the 2012 Prevention of Children from Sexual Exploitation (POCSO) Actand sections of the Indian Penal Code. As first reported by HT on February 25, the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules 2021 have been notified which say that intermediaries shall remove or disable access to content that exposes the private areas of individuals, show such individuals in full or partial nudity or in sexual act or is in the nature of impersonation, including morphed images, etc, within 24 hours of receipt of complaints.In November last year, a junior engineer in Uttar Pradesh was arrested by the CBI for allegedly sexually exploiting around 50 children and selling their videos and photos on the dark web. The agency has included his name in the ICSE database of sexual predators as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/10-held-as-cbi-raids-77-places-in-crackdown-on-child-porn-101637083769522.html
16-11-2021||India||Modi opens eastern UP gateway in poll take-off||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday inaugurated a six-lane expressway meant to ease transport and unlock investment in eastern Uttar Pradesh, and accused previous state governments of neglecting the region, in a major development push months before a high-stakes assembly election.Modi landed in a C-130J Super Hercules aircraft on a 3.2km stretch of the 341km Purvanchal Expressway developed as an emergency airstrip for the Indian Air Force. He also saw an air show with French-made Mirage jets and Russian Su-30MKIs using the road as a runway.“The previous governments reduced the vital eastern part of the state to ‘mafiawaad’ and poverty, but the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government is now writing a new chapter of development,” he said. Eastern UP holds 160 of the state’s 403 assembly seats that go to the polls early next year. The PM was speaking in Sultanpur after inaugurating the expressway that connects state capital Lucknow to Ghazpur in the relatively underdeveloped eastern UP, and cuts down travel time to 3.5 hours from 6 hours. The ₹22,500 crore project has stirred a political row with the previous Samajwadi Party government claiming credit for green-lighting the highway.Modi’s event also highlighted the country’s dual-use expressways that double up as emergency military airstrips as India looks to boost its military preparedness.“India’s prosperity is as important as our national security. This expressway has become a new strength for our air force,” Modi said.“The emergency landing facility for aircraft on the expressway is a symbol of strength for the Indian Air Force. It’s a message to those who neglected defence infrastructure of the country,” he added. The expressway begins at Chaudsarai village on the outskirts of Lucknow and ends in Hydaria village on National Highway 31, just 18 km from the Uttar Pradesh-Bihar border. After the address, Modi, Uttar Pradesh governor Anandiben Patel and chief minister Yogi Adityanath were among those who watched the air show.A Mirage-2000 was the first to land. Commandos emerged later from the belly of an An-32 aircraft. Another Mirage, two Jaguars and an Su-30MKI performed touch-and-go manoeuvres on the air strip.The aircraft also flew in formation and ended the show with a flypast. An announcer identified one of the Sukhoi pilots as a local man from Sultanpur. Terming the Purvanchal expressway as a symbol of new UP and its progress, Modi said it will bridge the gap between western and eastern UP. The PM invoked Hindu god Hanuman and lauded the contribution of the people of the district in the freedom struggle. “I bow to the people of the land on which Lord Hanuman killed Kalanemi. In the 1857 struggle, the people of the area fought the British. The land carries the fragrance of the Independence struggle. And today, the holy land is getting the gift of Purvanchal Expressway,” he said. Development was limited to places where the previous chief ministers had their homes or families, the PM said, without naming opposition parties. “The government, which was in power in UP before the BJP government, did not assist me. The then CM did not share dais with me fearing that his vote bank will get angry (reference to Akhilesh Yadav of the Samajwadi Party). The governments before the Yogi government were unfair to people, neglected development of the state and focused on the well being of their family. The people of UP removed them from power. They gave a big mandate to Yogi and Modi in 2017 and 2019 to serve them,” he said. “In UP, we have seen a long period of governments who showed dreams of industrialisation without worrying about connectivity. As a result, many factories located here were shut due to lack of infrastructure. It was also unfortunate that both Delhi and Lucknow were dominated by the dynasts. For years, this partnership of family members kept crushing the aspirations of Uttar Pradesh,” he said. Modi emphasised that the BJP’s “double engine government” was working for the welfare of people and development of the state. “Along with running old industries, it is creating an environment for new investments,” he said. “When I laid the foundation stone of the Purvanchal Expressway three years back, I had never thought that I will land here on an aircraft one day,” added the PM. Modi said the BJP government was changing the destiny of the state. “Who can forget regular power cuts earlier, deterioration in law and order, lack of medical facilities and loot incidents. Now, those who committed loot are in jail and new roads are being constructed across the state,” he added. “In the last seven years, villages in eastern and western UP have been connected with roads. The dream of UP’s development is being fulfilled. New medical colleges, modern educational institutions and airports have also been constructed,” he said. The PM said the Yogi government was working with the ‘sabka saath, sabka vikas’ (inclusive development for all) mantra without any discrimination. “The industrial corridor is being developed along the expressway and 21 spots have been selected for the purpose,” he said. Lauding the state’s vaccination drive, Modi said UP had become a leading state in administering jabs. “People ignored political misinformation and conspiracy over the Covid vaccine manufactured in the country. My government is working hard for the development of UP. Women have benefitted most under the BJP government – they have got pucca houses, power supply, cooking gas, toilets, piped drinking water supply, better health facilities under Ayushman Bharat scheme,” emphasised the PM. Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav said that the project was conceived when he was chief minister in 2016. “How will BJP be able to wipe out from the pages of history that the foundation for the expressway was laid in December 2016,” he said.“There is a tussle to take credit for the work of SP,” he later tweeted in Hindi.“During the lockdown, when lakhs of laborers were returning from Delhi to their villages in UP on foot, the BJP government did not provide buses to the workers. But, the government is spending crores of public’s hard earned money to bring crowd in the rallies of PM and Home Minister,” Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-opens-eastern-up-gateway-in-poll-takeoff-101637083048844.html

16-11-2021||India||Day after encounter, 3 detained in Kashmir with around ₹30 lakh||As many as three people were detained in Jammu & Kashmir on Tuesday with nearly ₹30 lakh on them. Police nabbed all of them near Ban Toll Plaza before handing them over to the Special Operations Group (SOG) in Jammu.The trio have been identified as Fayaz Ahmed Dar (40), Umar Farooq (19) and Mausam Parviz. While Umar and Mausam hailed from Pulwama, Fayaz belonged to Kulgam.This development comes after an encounter unfolded in Srinagar’s Hyderpora region on Monday resulting in the death of two unidentified terrorists.However, the death of two civilians – Altaf Ahmad Dar, the owner of the shopping complex where the incident took place, and Mudasir Gul, one of the tenants of the building — during the encounter have invited sharp criticisms from their families as well as the political leaders of the Valley.Both Dar and Gul’s families have claimed they were innocent. Moreover, Ahmad’s family alleged that he was used as a “human shield” by Jammu and Kashmir Police forces and killed in “cold blood.”Meanwhile, J&K Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chief Mehbooba Mufti and National Conference vice-president Omar Abdullah demanded a judicial probe into the matter.However, following the encounter on Monday, the police said in a statement that both Dar and Gul were working as “militant associate” or “overground workers” for the deceased terrorists.Inspector general (Kashmir) Vijay Kumar said that Gul, who used to work as a contractor, also allegedly ran a fake call centre. He added that Gul was allegedly running a module of terrorists, while living in one of the rooms that Dar had rented out to him. “Since the hideout was in the building of Dar … so he will be counted as an overground worker for harbouring militants,” Kumar added.He further said that J&K Police forces had tried to save Dar but as he got caught up between the firing, he could not be saved. “We regret his killing,” Kumar said.The Kashmir IG has identified both the deceased terrorists, with one of them named Bilal Bhai alias Hyder, believed to be hailing from Pakistan. The second terrorist is from Jammu’s Ramban area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/day-after-encounter-3-detained-in-kashmir-with-around-rs-30-lakh-101637079947582.html
16-11-2021||India||India beefs up sea power with new assets; armed drones in the works||The Indian Navy will commission a modern locally built destroyer next week, along with a submarine constructed in the country with French collaboration, to strengthen its capabilities amid changing power dynamics in the Indian Ocean Region, navy vice chief Vice Admiral SN Ghormade said on Tuesday. This comes when a proposed procurement of armed drones from the US is set to come up for critical approval shortly.India plans to induct 30 Predator drones, 10 each for the navy, air force and army, in a deal estimated to be worth $3 billion.Defence minister Rajnath Singh will commission the stealth guided missile destroyer Visakhapatnam in Mumbai on November 21 followed by the induction of a French-designed Kalvari class diesel-electric attack submarine, Vela, on November 25 at a ceremony to be presided over by navy chief Admiral Karambir Singh.“The commissioning of Visakhapatnam and Vela are major milestones and showcase indigenous capacity to build complex combat platforms. This will enhance our capacity and fire power to address threats both in the above water and underwater domains,” Ghormade said. Both platforms have been built at Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Ltd in Mumbai.Visakhapatnam is the first warship of the navy’s Project-15B under which three more warships will be delivered by 2025. Vela is the fourth of the six Kalvari class submarines being constructed in the country with technology transfer from French firm Naval Group under a ₹23,562-crore programme called Project 75. The remaining two submarines will be commissioned in two years.“Global and regional balance of power is shifting rapidly and the region of most rapid change is undoubtedly the Indian Ocean Region. Continuous efforts are on to ensure that our force levels grow progressively to enhance the capability of the Indian Navy to meet the emerging challenges,” the vice chief said.The commissioning of Visakhapatnam, armed with a variety of locally built weapons and sensors, will reaffirm India’s presence among an elite group of nations with the capability to design and build advanced warships, he said. Vela is a potent platform and very few countries possess the capability to build submarines, Ghormade said.While it may seem that there is a spate of new commissioning of ships, these are all overdue accretions, said maritime affairs expert Rear Admiral Sudarshan Shrikhande (retd).“Given the threats and tasks of the Indian Navy, much more needs to be done, especially for indigenisation. One hopes that not only greater budgetary support but more Atmanirbharta (self-reliance) can be ensured in the years to come,” Shrikhande added.India is also pursuing a project (P-75I) worth ₹40,000 crore for building six more advanced submarines in the country under the government’s strategic partnership (SP) model to bolster the Indian Navy’s underwater force levels and counter the rapid expansion of China’s submarine fleet.The Indian strategic partners cleared to collaborate with the foreign players are Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited and L&T. The foreign yards they can team up with for the project are the French Naval Group, German conglomerate Thyssenkrupp Marine Systems, Russia’s Rubin Design Bureau, Spain’s Navantia and South Korea’s Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Company.On the proposed Predator purchase, Ghormade said “healthy discussions” were on among stakeholders and the case was progressing well. He said the proposal to buy the armed drones was likely to be taken up by the defence acquisition council (DAC) - India’s apex procurement body - in a short while. DAC’s approval for the drones is likely to be sought within the current financial year, HT has learnt.The Indian Navy last year leased a pair of MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones (an unarmed variant of the Predators manufactured by General Atomics) from the US to boost its intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities. The MQ-9Bs have helped the navy keep a close watch on the Indian Ocean at a time when it has stepped up surveillance in the region to check China’s ambitions.The commissioning of Visakhapatnam and Vela will be followed by the launch of Sandhayak in early December, the first of four large survey vessels to be built by Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers (GRSE), Kolkata, Ghormade said. A ship’s launch marks a significant milestone in its construction and refers to the vessel entering water for the first time.The contract for building the four ships was signed between the defence ministry and GRSE in October 2018. “The ships will come with new generation hydrographic equipment and advanced technical capabilities for collecting oceanographic and geophysical data in the Indian Ocean Region,” he added. Sandhayak is likely to be delivered to the navy in October 2022.The Indian Navy’s latest frigate, Tushil, was launched last month at the Yantar Shipyard in Kaliningrad, with Russia preparing to deliver two new warships to India in 2023.Tushil is part of an over $2.5-billion deal with Russia for four more Krivak/Talwar class stealth frigates for the Indian Navy, two of which are being constructed at the Yantar Shipyard while the remaining two will be built at the Goa Shipyard Limited (GSL) with technology transfer from Russia, which is India’s top arms supplier. Tushil is expected to be commissioned into the Indian Navy in mid-2023 followed by its sister ship in 2023-end.GSL is expected to deliver the two frigates by 2026-27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-beefs-up-sea-power-with-new-assets-armed-drones-in-the-works-101637080350776.html
16-11-2021||India||Who is Saurabh Kirpal, advocate who may become India's first openly gay judge?||In a historic move, Chief Justice NV Ramana-headed Supreme Court collegium in India has recommended the elevation of senior advocate Saurabh Kirpal as a judge of the Delhi high court. If approved by the Union government, Kirpal may become the country’s first openly gay judge in a constitutional court.Kirpal’s recommendation was mired with controversy for the past four years due to the Union government’s preliminary objections because of his sexual orientation.Besides CJI Ramana, Justices U U Lalit and A M Khanwilkar are also part of the three-member collegium which has sought the appointment of Kirpal as a judge.Here’s what you should know about Saurbah Kirpal:Early yearsGraduating with a physics major from Delhi’s St Stephen’s College, Saurabh Kirpal went ahead to earn a law degree from the University of Oxford and a masters in law from the University of Cambridge. He then returned to India following a brief stint at the United Nations in Geneva.The 49-year-old advocate is the son of Bhupinder Nath Kirpal, who served as the 31st Chief Justice of India from May to November in 2002.CareerKirpal has been practising at the Supreme Court for more than two decades. He was also the counsel for Navtej Johar, Ritu Dalmia and others in the celebrated case that led to the landmark reading down of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code in 2018, thus decriminalising gay sex.He has written an anthology titled “Sex and the Supreme Court: How the Law is Upholding the Dignity of the Indian Citizen” and is also a board member of the Naz Foundation Trust, a Delhi-based NGO that has been at the forefront of India’s battle against Section 377.ControversyKirpal was first recommended for elevation in 2017 by the Delhi high court collegium, then led by acting chief justice Gita Mittal. The proposal was approved by the apex court's collegium too. However, the top court later decided to defer the decision on appointing him as a judge.In an interview to HT in September 2020, Kirpal acknowledged that his sexuality could be the reason behind the Supreme Court collegium deferring the decision as well as the government raising objections.“Media reports seemed to indicate the issue might have been the nationality of my partner who is Swiss. Had I been a straight man with a foreign spouse, this would not have been an issue; former Supreme Court judges have had foreign spouses. But it became an issue only because I am not,” Kirpal had told HT.Notably, the SC collegium deferred its decision on Kirpal’s recommendation on three occasions — in January 2019, April 2019 and in August last year. His name was discussed among 18 other proposals, some of whom were cleared. However, Kirpal’s name was held back.In March 2021, the then CJI SA Bobde wrote to the Union government, seeking additional information and more clarity on its reservations over Kirpal’s name. The Centre reiterated its apprehensions about his partner.The same month, Kirpal was designated as a senior advocate by the Delhi high court after all 31 judges of the high court unanimously endorsed his designation. The proposal can once again be returned by the Centre. But if his name is sent back for elevation, they have no option but to approve it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/who-is-saurabh-kirpal-advocate-who-may-become-india-s-first-openly-gay-judge-101637077993072.html

The new prices will be effective from the midnight of November 16, the chief minister added.In a post from his official handle, Gehlot tweeted, “In the Cabinet meeting today, it was unanimously decided to reduce the rate of VAT on petrol/diesel. From 12 o'clock tonight, the rates will be reduced by ₹4 per liter for petrol and ₹5 per liter for diesel.”In the Cabinet meeting today, it was unanimously decided to reduce the rate of VAT on petrol/diesel. From 12 o'clock tonight, the rates will be reduced by ₹4 per liter for petrol and ₹5 per liter for diesel.The decision to cut the VAT on petrol and diesel prices has cost the state government a loss of ₹3,500 crore in the annual revenue, the chief minister added. “Due to this, the state government will incur a loss of ₹3,500 crore in annual revenue,” Gehlot said in a subsequent tweet.Notably, in a significant decision this month, the Centre had reduced the excise duty on petrol and diesel to bring down the prices of the two petroleum products which had been seeing an upward trend. The relief, which came to the consumers on the eve of Diwali, said to them that the excise duty on petrol will come down by ₹5 and that on diesel by ₹10.Earlier this week, the chief minister of Rajasthan had requested the Narendra Modi-led central government to further the cut on excise duty on petrol and diesel. Referring to the finance ministry's request to the states “to commensurately reduce” VAT on petrol and diesel to give relief to consumers, Gehlot had said, “We demand the central government to further cut petrol and diesel prices; if the Centre reduces fuel prices, then, it will be reduced in the states too.”With Rajasthan, 26 states and Union territories have so far undertaken a commensurate reduction of VAT on petrol and diesel to give relief to consumers, according to estimates provided by the Union ministry of petroleum and natural gas last week.As per ministry data, only 10 states and Union territories have not yet undertaken any reduction in VAT on petrol and diesel prices. These are – Maharashtra, NCT of Delhi, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Jharkhand, and Chhattisgarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-cuts-vat-on-petrol-and-diesel-prices-new-rates-effective-midnight-101637078762240.html

The gang allegedly used Amazon’s portal to transport marijuana from Visakhapatnam to other parts of the country, said police. Advocate Sumant Narang and Amazon’s Gwalior station head Shashank Singh met Bhind superintendent of police Manoj Singh to discuss the case after police visited Amazon’s warehouse facility in Gwalior on Sunday. SP Manoj Kumar Singh confirmed the meeting. He said, “I sought some details related to verification of sellers and products but they didn’t share much information. They asked us to send an email related to the investigation and the details required. Now we are sending them an official email seeking details related to the verification of seller and others.” When contacted, Narang refused to talk about the meeting but said they were cooperating with the police in the investigation. On Saturday, police arrested two members of the gang - Suraj Pawaiya and Vijendra Singh Tomar - both residents of Bhind, with 20 kg of Marijuana from a dhaba (local eatery) in Gohad. The two accused, who were on a police remand of three days, informed that a company registered in 2007 as a textile entity from Ahmedabad, Gujarat - Babu Tex Private Limited- used to sell marijuana as supernatural stevia dry leaves. On the website, 2 kilograms of leaves was for ₹180. As of now, 1-tonne marijuana has already been transported through the e-commerce site with associated transactions worth ₹1.1 crore. The police found that 768 kgs of marijuana were supplied through 384 orders in Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh in the past seven months. In all the cases, the payment was done through one UPI ID only. Amazon used to take a 66.66% share of ₹180, so the company was also making a profit out of it, said an investigating officer. In the investigation, if the company’s employee is found involved, an FIR will be registered against him too under the NDPS Act, said the SP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drug-peddlers-use-amazon-for-marijuana-supply-2-company-officials-meet-mp-police-for-probe-101637078610057.html
16-11-2021||India||Air quality fluctuations solely depend on wind for now||With farm fires in Punjab and Haryana decreasing and wind speed picking up, air quality in Delhi showed a marginal improvement since this weekend, compared to the week after Diwali, data from satellites and air quality stations analysed by HT shows.The one-hour average concentration of PM2.5 particles – particles of diameter less than 2.5 micrometres – in Delhi was more than 200 micrograms per cubic metre in 176 of the 216 one-hour intervals from midnight of November 5 to the end of November 13. Diwali was celebrated on the night of November 4.This means that in 81% of the one-hour intervals after Diwali to November 13, PM2.5 concentration was above 200 microgram per cubic metre. From midnight of November 14 to 4 PM on November 16, this share has dropped to 52%. In only 33 of the 64 one-hour intervals in this period PM2.5 has averaged above 200 micrograms per cubic metre.To be sure, this does not mean that the air quality in Delhi is good right now. The analysis above only means that air pollution is on the higher end of the “very poor” or lower end of “severe” category rather than on its upper end. In 99% of the one-hour intervals from November 5 to November 13, the PM2.5 concentration was in very poor or worse (concentration above 120 micrograms per cubic metre). This has marginally decreased to 94% of the one-hour intervals in the period analysed after November 13.A combination of lower farm fires and higher wind speed is responsible for this improvement. From November 5 to November 11, fires observed in Punjab and Haryana averaged 5,269 per day, according to Suomi-NPP satellite’s VIIRS instrument. From November 12 to November 16, they have averaged 3,178. The number of fires observed in the two states have decreased daily after November 13. The number was 4,570 on November 13 and is 2072 on November 16.However, November 12 was about just as bad a day for air quality in Delhi as November 5 (the day after Diwali) because wind speed was lower than it was in the November 5-November 11 period. With farm fires decreasing in Punjab and Haryana and wind speed increasing back again after November 12, both the addition of pollutants in the air and their accumulation in the air has decreased. This has made a minor improvement in the air quality of the National Capital Territory.The trends underscore the fact that none of the steps and mechanisms put in place over the last five years have made any difference in what determines how bad the pollution will be -- the only determinants are weather and the farm fires in neighbouring states. Experts have long called for new, consequential mechanisms that could help reduce these effects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-quality-fluctuations-solely-depend-on-wind-for-now-101637078129835.html

One didn’t go according to script||BHUBANESWAR: The Central Bureau of Investigation on Tuesday conducted raids at 76 locations across 14 states and union territories in 23 cases allegedly involving online child porn. Many of the targets of these raids were members of WhatsApp groups that circulated child sexual exploitation material.In all, the first information reports (FIR) registered by CBI over the last few days named 83 individuals along with their phone numbers and addresses who were known to have circulated or downloaded child porn, mostly on their phones. There was no formal statement by CBI on the outcome of the raids. But there was one raid in Odisha’s Dhenkanal district that clearly did not go according to the agency’s script.This team of CBI officials turned up at Colony Sahi house of 25-year-old Surendra Nayak in Dhenkanal town early on Tuesday morning.A CBI official who was part of the team said Nayak was alleged to be part of a WhatsApp group, “Desi MMS”, that was used by members to circulate pornographic material including child porn. An initial inquiry by CBI led officials to believe that he also received US $ 21 for circulating child sexual exploitation material.But as soon as word spread about the raid, the team found themselves surrounded by the womenfolk of the area, many of them armed with wooden sticks.“As we seized Nayak’s mobile phone, we suddenly came under attack from the women. We were first locked in a room and then dragged out by the women with many of them beating us up with the wooden planks,” the official said, requesting anonymity.The CBI team was finally rescued by police personnel from the Dhenkanal town police station after senior police officers received SOS messages from CBI.Senior CBI officials in Odisha capital Bhubaneswar declined to comment on the incident.Dhenkanal superintendent of police K Siva Subramani, however, confirmed the attack.“The CBI team had not informed us before the raid…. We managed to get them out the place,” the district SP said.Nayak The CBI team later summoned Nayak to the police station where he allegedly told the team that he joined the WhatsApp group two months ago and did share pornographic material with others in the group.A little over 100km away, another CBI team raided auto driver Manoj Das in Binayakpur village under Agarpada police station of Bhadrak district. Das has been accused of circulating explicit videos of minors on his mobile phone. A third CBI team questioned Anil Majhi of Keutanguan village in Jajpur district over similar allegations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-conducts-76-raids-for-online-child-porn-one-didn-t-go-according-to-script-101637076688963.html
16-11-2021||India||Punjab cannot handle its paddy, but it can’t change without help||The toxic air in Delhi and adjoining areas is a by-product of multiple factors. But the smoke from stubble burning, which travels to Delhi from the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana is an important contributor to pollution levels. In the period from October 20 this year, the contribution of stubble burning to Delhi’s PM2.5 concentration has ranged between 2% on October 24 to as much as 48% on November 7, according to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR). Why have governments failed to stop farm fires and their polluting effects? An HT analysis of Punjab’s agricultural statistics show that this will not happen without a holistic re-evaluation of agricultural practices in the state. Here’s why.Why, Punjab?The simplest answer to this question is that Punjab is responsible for the largest number of farm fires in the northern region. Data from the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi-NPP) shows that number of farm-fires in Punjab until November 14 this year is over six times the number of fires in the states of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.There is no doubt that stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana produces smoke. How much does that smoke contribute to pollution in Delhi? The contribution can vary depending on the amount of stubble burnt and the proportion of that smoke that enters Delhi and stays close to the ground. The latter two are dependent on temperature and the speed and direction of wind. Because the weather conditions helpful for accumulation of pollutants close to the ground in Delhi – low-speed wind blowing from north-west to east and low temperatures – coincide with the stubble burning period, PM2.5 concentration in Delhi has a high correlation with fires in Punjab and Haryana in October and November.Why stubble burning?It is a race against time for farmers. There is a very small window between the harvesting of the kharif (monsoon) season’s paddy crop and sowing of the rabi (winter) crop in this region. This is partly a result of government regulations that mandate delayed sowing of the kharif crop (because there is a shortage of water, itself brought about by the fascination with paddy in this part of the country). Then there is the question of money. Setting fire to fields to prepare them for farming is among the oldest methods in agriculture. This is how early humans learnt agriculture, except what they would set fire to what were forest lands. The reason this technique has resurfaced in regions such as Punjab is, ironical as it may sound, not a lack of technique – our ancestors did not have the farm equipment we have today – but the economics of farming. Paddy, when harvested by human labour does not leave behind much in terms of stubble. This is not the case when it comes to harvesting with machines such as combine harvesters.There are two factors that encourage the use of mechanised harvesting in Punjab compared to other states: larger farm sizes, which facilitates theuse of such machines and higher cost of labour compared to other states. Data from the latest Land and Livestock Holdings of Households and Situation Assessment of Agricultural Households (SAS) by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) puts this in perspective.The average size of land under paddy cultivation is 1.97 hectares in Punjab and 1.88 hectares in Haryana, among the highest under paddy cultivation in major states. This is in complete contrast with the situation outside Punjab. The average size of land under paddy cultivation in the third-ranked state (Madhya Pradesh) is almost half of that in Punjab (1.01 hectares). In most big states, the average size of land under paddy cultivation is under one hectare.This, when read with the fact that average agricultural wages in Punjab are higher than the national average, and even more so than the agricultural labour exporting states such as Bihar, Jharkhand and parts of Uttar Pradesh, explains why it makes sense for farmers in Punjab to first use mechanised harvesting and then resort to stubble-burning.The dominance of big farmers in paddy cultivation in Punjab (and its neighbouring Haryana) is a reflection of the fact that paddy is more a commercial than subsistence crop in these states. This is borne out by the fact that paddy’s share of themarketed surplus is significantly higher in Punjab than in eastern states such as Bihar and West Bengal.Agricultural policy has played a role too. 71% of the total rice procurement in the 2021-22 Kharif Marketing Season (figures up to November 11, 2021) in India was in the state of Punjab. Any sudden withdrawal of this support will inflict a huge economic shock to the farmers in the state, as receipts from paddy accounted for more than half of cultivation receipts in Punjab in the latest SAS. As is obvious this will also have a huge political backlash. To hope that the state’s farmers will stop cultivating paddy (and burning its stubble) without a holistic overhaul of agricultural policy is an exercise in collective delusion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-cannot-handle-its-paddy-but-it-can-t-change-without-help-101637075848262.html
16-11-2021||India||HT THIS DAY: November 17, 2019 — Women turned back after Kerala’s Sabarimala shrine opens||Pambha- Police stopped five women from trekking up to the Sabarimala temple on the first day of the pilgrimage on Saturday, sparking criticism from activists and experts who said the move violated the Supreme Court’s orders allowing the entry of female devotees of menstruating age in the Kerala hilltop shrine.The five women, part of a group of 18 travellers from Andhra Pradesh, were asked to go back from the base camp of Pambha in south Kerala’s Pathanamthitta district.“We checked their identity cards and found that they were in the barred age group and informed them about the current situation in Sabarimala. They did not proceed further,” a senior police official said on condition of anonymity.The development came barely two days after the Supreme Court referred to a larger bench petitions challenging its 2018 judgment overturning a decades-old ban at Sabarimala on female devotees between 10 and 50 years of age. The new seven judge bench will also look into seven other matters linked to faith.In its 3:2 ruling delivered on Thursday, the apex court did not suspend its landmark order, with justice Rohinton Nariman, who authored the minority dissenting judgment, explicitly asking the Kerala government to ensure strict compliance with the 2018 verdict. But the state administration has since refused to provide security to women devotees of childbearing age, saying it will consult with experts before deciding on the issue.A posse of at least 10,000 security personnel have been deployed to maintain order at the base camp. Women police officers asked all female devotees to show documents to prove their age. “We are simply following the orders of our superiors,” a woman inspector said on condition of anonymity.The development came barely two days after the Supreme Court referred to a larger bench petitions challenging its 2018 judgment overturning a decades- old ban at Sabarimala on female devotees between 10 and 50 years of age.

Women police officers asked all female devotees to show documents to prove their age. “We are simply following the orders of our superiors,” a woman inspector said on condition of anonymity.One of the women sent back, 42-year-old Padmavati Naidu, said she was told that the top court had lifted all restrictions on the entry of women. “I did not expect this fate. When I told police officers about this, they had no replies either,” she said, fighting back tears.The Travancore Devasom Board, which runs the temple, underplayed the incident. “There was no checking. We apprised them about our difficulties and they went back,” said the newly appointed TDB president N Vasu.The government’s stand and the police action angered reformists and women activists.“It is sad that the police are back to the same old tactics. The Supreme Court has made it clear that there is no stay on its 2018 verdict. How can they prevent women like this? It seems the government is bowing before trouble-makers and some zealots,” said Bindhu Ammini, one of two women who were the first to enter the temple in January this year. She said she will move court against the police action.Activist and Bhumata Brigade leader Trupti Deasi, who has announced her plan to visit the temple, also criticised the state government. “The state is bound to go by the 2018 verdict of the Supreme Court. It is the state’s responsibility to give protection to women,” she said.Legal experts blamed the state government and police. “Preventing women from offering prayers at the temple constitutes contempt of the Supreme Court. It is sad that the Kerala government is not doing anything to aid the entry of women in the temple,” said Supreme Court advocate Viplav Sharma.“The court has categorically held that women have a right to pray at the temple. Even though the court has referred the matter to a seven-judge bench, there is no stay on the earlier judgment,”he added.Senior lawyer Asha Unnithan agreed. “The Supreme Court did not stay the verdict. So it is binding on the government to go by it,” she said.At Pambha, tens of thousands of male devotees, many of them barefoot and dressed in the traditional black clothes, readied in neat files for the 5-km trek through thick forests and streams for a glimpse of the deity Ayappa. Traditionalists in Kerala contend that the entry of female worshippers of childbearing age into the sanctum sanctorum in Sabarimala is a sacrilege because Ayyappa is celibate.The orderly pilgrimage was a sharp contrast from scenes a year ago when violent clashes broke out almost daily between the police and enraged devotees, who slept in nearby shops and the steps and managed to stop women devotees for roughly three months after the SC verdict. Women pilgrims were regularly pelted with stones and at least one male devotee set himself on fire to protest against the entry of women of menstruating age.On Saturday, many of those devotees appeared satisfied, and said peace was back at their favourite temple. “God is supreme. The highest court heard our cries for peace at the temple,” said Suramanyan Swami, a devotee from neighbouring Tamil Nadu’s Erode. A second devotee said he skipped last year’s pilgrimage fearing violence but that he was back this year with more “vigour and devotion”.The chief priest or tantri of Sabarimala, Mahesh Kandarau, opened the temple doors at 5pm for the two-month Mandala- Makaravilakku pilgrimage season. “In the first one hour, more than 10,000 pilgrims passed the police check post,” said a senior police officer.After the 2018 SC judgment, the Left Front-ruled Kerala government had thrown its weight behind the women devotees and provided them security. But this time, the administration has appeared more evasive, with temple minister Kadakampally Surendran making it clear that the government won’t provide police cover to women devotees of menstruating age.“Sabarimala was not a place for activists to display activism and the government will not encourage women who want to visit the shrine for publicity,” he said on Friday.Hindu groups have already declared they will block any woman of childbearing age if they try to enter the temple. “We respect the government’s assurance. But, if they cheat us like last year, they will have to face repercussions,” said RV Babu, leader of the Sabarimala Karma Samiti, an apex body of Hindu outfits that has said hundreds of its volunteers are closely watching the pilgrimage route.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htthisday-november-17-2019-women-turned-back-after-kerala-s-sabarimala-shrine-opens-101637075385495.html
16-11-2021||India||‘Lack of industrial growth is good for Assam’s environment’: Padma Shri Jadav Payeng||Padma Shri awardee Jadav Payeng of Assam’s Jorhat district, who is also known as the ‘The Forest Man of India’, feels that lack of industrialisation is good for the environment.In his opinion, the Assam government should make policies to reduce industrialisation and give plants their space to grow. Payeng’s comments came during the sixth Northeast Green Summit at the National Institute of Technology, Silchar, on Tuesday morning.62-year-old Payeng earned his name as ‘The Forest Man of India’ by spending 30 years of his life planting around 40 million trees on 550 hectares of land on the banks of the Brahmaputra river.Interacting with Hindustan Times after the event at the premises of Silchar NIT, Payeng said, “Environment studies need to be included in education from primary level so that kids understand the value of preserving it. The syllabus should focus on important issues like climate change and impact of deforestation instead of the existing age-old content.”Apart from pointing out the need for an environment university in Assam, he mentioned how trees were worshipped in ancient India. “In Indian culture, we worship trees. In some Indian states, it still exists. We should start worshipping trees following the Indian culture which will have a deep impact on our environment,” he said.“India will be the most populated country in the world by 2050. We need to start foresting more to strike a balance otherwise next generations will face so many problems and will blame us for that,” Payeng added.He appealed to the Central government and Bangladesh to plant more trees at the border. According to him, this will help in solving many border issues apart from improving the environment.The sixth edition of the Northeast Green Summit, which is being organised jointly by Silchar NIT and VIBGYOR NE Foundation, kicked off with a tree plantation drive and discussion on issues of climate change on Tuesday morning. The theme of this year’s summit is “Greening After Covid: Regional cooperation, Innovation & Entrepreneurship.” Rajkumar Ranjan Singh, MoS, Ministry of Education & External Affairs, Government of India; Dr Rajdeep Roy, Member of Parliament from Silchar, along with other important dignitaries were present on the opening day of the summit.Director of Silchar NIT, professor Sivaji Bandyopadhyay, while addressing the event said, “The summit has received wide participation in terms of research papers submitted across the country and abroad. A total of 240 research articles have been submitted out of which 120 papers have been accepted through a peer-review process to be presented during the summit.”“The summit will be addressing the themes on agriculture, sustainability, environment, energy, biodiversity, eco-tourism and post-Covid world,” he added.He also informed that Ashwini Choubey, MOS, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change will also be present at the event along with forest ministers of all seven Northeastern states on November 18.Some of the social activists and NGOs were felicitated on the opening day of the summit, including a 9-year-old boy from Dholai constituency of Cachar district who is planting 1000 saplings in his area to increase oxygen.

He left their bodies in the forest.It was only nine days later, on November 14, that the police found the bodies after being alerted by a forest guard.Initially, police officers were only looking at a murder case. Tiwari said it was only when the body was sent for an autopsy that it turned out that she had been raped before she was strangled too.The 55-year-old was booked for murder and rape. His 23-year-old son has been charged for the murder conspiracy.The accused had been upfront about killing his daughter and told his son about the murder, not the rape. The next day, the two also told his elder daughter that he killed her sibling.“During interrogation, the father said he was looking for a chance to kill his daughter and when she contacted him, he couldn’t control his anger,” the father told the police after his arrest, according to police officer Umesh Tiwari. He reportedly said villagers used to mock him and many relatives stopped inviting his family over because of his daughter’s inter-caste marriage.The woman lived in the Shujalpur area of Shajapur district with her husband. On October 20, she went with her baby to celebrate Diwali to her elder sister’s house in Bhopal since her husband was going to be in Chhatisgarh capital Raipur for some time. He worked with a tent house.It was during this visit that her son died of pneumonia. She didn’t tell her husband about their child’s death. Her elder sister called her father and brother, who live in Sehore district, next door to Bhopal.“The father, who had broken all the ties with the woman after her inter-caste marriage, came and asked her to bury baby’s body. The father and brother took the woman to a forest to bury the baby’s body,” said Tiwari.“The man asked his son to guard the motorcycle and accompanied his daughter into the forest,” said Tiwari. He started speaking about her decision to marry outside her caste. But his daughter didn’t say a word. The police officer said he claims to have lost his cool and started beating his daughter. Later, he raped her before strangling her. Tiwari said the son and his elder sister were not aware of the rape. Ratibad police station in-charge Sudesh Tiwari said police told the woman’s husband about his wife’s murder on Monday. The woman didn’t have a mobile phone and had last spoken to him on Diwali using someone else’s phone“We got married one-and-a-half years ago after eloping. Her father had filed a fake complaint that his daughter was missing, at Bilkisganj police in Sehore then but we informed police that we were married. Her father then threatened to kill his daughter if she ever returned to his house,” the husband said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-man-rapes-daughter-25-who-married-outside-caste-then-kills-her-cop-101637072548573.html

16-11-2021||India||India aims for better practices to cut agri emissions, experts call for clear goals||India will step up efforts to curb emissions in agriculture within a national mission for sustainable agriculture, having stayed off a farm action agenda at the recent Glasgow COP26 climate summit, an official aware of the matter said. The mission falls within the ambit of the National Action Plan on Climate Change, a programme that aims to make Indian farms more resilient to changing climate and is being monitored at the highest levels, the official said. Globally, agriculture is responsible for a third of all greenhouse gas emissions, three-quarters of them coming from livestock farming alone.For all its ambitious climate commitments – from Copenhagen to Paris and now, Glasgow’s COP26 - India needs a comprehensive policy on cutting farming emissions, the third-largest source of carbon after energy and manufacturing sectors, some experts say. That will require a balance between competing choices such as farmers’ livelihoods as well as food security and drawing down on carbon-heavy agricultural practices. “The central role played by agriculture and food systems tend to be overlooked… The food system receives much less attention, even though it generates 26-37 per cent of GHG [greenhouse gas] emissions,” said Compassion in World Farming charity in its report to the COP26, a UN’s climate change conference. The official cited above said the country had made steady progress on sustainable agriculture parameters such as on-farm water management and soil health cards. Soil testing of over 100 million samples have promoted less-carbon-intensive agriculture by rebalancing the use of crop nutrients, such as nitrogenous fertilisers, the official said.Some studies show soil-health cards need to be redesigned. In a study by the Cereal Systems Initiative for South Asia, many farmers were found to be not “familiar with all nutrients and micronutrients listed on the cards,” the International Food Policy Research Institute said in a report. The largest emissions from within agriculture come from livestock farming and continuously irrigated and deep-water paddy cultivation in the states of West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha and Bihar, according to a study by economist Ashok Gulati. Methane released from agricultural activities and food systems is the main source of greenhouse gases. Limiting Earth’s temperature rise to 1.5C would require drastic cuts to meat and dairy output. Deforestation and release of carbon dioxide have to do with growing large amounts of crops to feed livestock for meat and dairy. India’s farm sector accounts for 14% of the country’s total greenhouse gas emissions, preceded by electricity (44%) and manufacturing industries and construction sectors combined (18%). India has the world’s largest cattle population at 535.78 million livestock, according to the 20th Livestock Census, 2019. Livestock makes up 78% of the 24 million tonnes of India’s total methane emissions, according to official data. “Methane emission due to enteric fermentation by the livestock (54.6%), and anaerobic conditions during rice cultivation (17.5%) and nitrous oxide emissions from application of nitrogenous fertilizers in agricultural soils (19.0%), together account for 91 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions (in India),” wrote economist Ashok Gulati in an October 2021 bulletin of the New Delhi think-tank ICRIER. According to the environment ministry’s data, greenhouse gas emissions from rice cultivation during 2016 accounted for 71.322 million tonnes “CO2 equivalent”, which analysts say might have gone up to 72.329 million tonnes “CO2 equivalent” during 2018-19. Cutting farming emissions can be done with steps such as “direct seeding of rice”, a method that decreases water use, in the top 5% of the rice districts, Gulati said. Gulati’s paper states that India could bring down farming emissions of 178 million tonnes of carbon equivalent with other measures, such as improved water management in 20 million hectares of irrigated rice fields, better livestock feed and manure management for 25% cattle population, stopping rice-crop residue burning with the target year of 2030 and reduction in farm energy and replacement with green energy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-aims-for-better-practices-to-cut-agri-emissions-experts-call-for-clear-goals-101637068230083.html

Bengal’s border with Bangladesh runs along 10 of the state’s 23 districts, from districts such as Darjeeling and Jalpaiguri in north Bengal to North 24 Parganas and South 24 Parganas in south Bengal.Bengal’s ruling party leaders argue that the BSF’s new jurisdiction will cover more than 30% of Bengal’s territory including many important towns and goes against the federal structure where law and order is the state’s responsibility. Tuesday’s resolution was moved by West Bengal parliamentary affairs minister Partha Chatterjee. “We demand that this decision be withdrawn immediately as enhancing the area of jurisdiction of the BSF is a direct attack on the country’s federal structure,” Chatterjee said, moving the resolution that was passed with the support of 112 legislators.The resolution, news agency PTI said, was opposed by 63 legislators from the Bharatiya Janata Party who supported the October 11 order of the Union ministry of home affairs to authorise the border guarding force to carry out “arrest, search and seizure” within 50km, up from the previous limit of 15km, from the international border in Punjab, West Bengal and Assam.BJP lawmakers insisted that the decision to extend BSF’s jurisdiction would help tighten security.Later, Suvendu Adhikari, leader of the opposition in the assembly, brushed away the resolution, which he said, “has no locus standi”. During the debate in the House, Adhikari demanded that BSF’s jurisdiction should be increased to at least 80km in Bengal.Bengal has turned into a hub for terror groups such as the Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB), he said, referring to recent arrests of suspected JMB members in Murshidabad and South 24 Parganas districts. He also accused some Trinamool Congress (TMC) legislators of statements during the debate, which he claimed, showed their support for illegal infiltrators from Bangladesh and their anti-India activities. It was a reference to a speech by TMC lawmaker from Dinhata in Cooch Behar district, Udayan Guha, who referred to the November 12 incident in which a local villager was killed along with two suspected Bangladesh nationals when some BSF personnel opened fire after they were allegedly attacked.Guha also spoke about corruption complaints received about BSF personnel and made some comments that prompted speaker Biman Banerjee had to stop him. On October 26, chief minister Mamata Banerjee set the tone for her government and Trinamool Congres over the home ministry order, saying she will not accept the notification.“This is direct interference with our state’s sovereignty and India’s federal structure. Law and order is a state subject. We have high respect for the BSF but they cannot operate inside our districts. We will oppose this,” Banerjee said at the state secretariat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/withdraw-bsf-s-50km-order-says-bengal-assembly-resolution-on-centre-s-move-101637066788337.html

16-11-2021||India||Singapore in talks with India for partial resumption of commercial flights||Singapore is in discussions with Indian authorities for a temporary bilateral arrangement for partial resumption of commercial flights between the two countries following the launch of a Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) for quarantine-free travel. The arrangement is needed as only commercial scheduled passenger flights can be designated as VTL flights, people familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity on Tuesday. Even the partial resumption of commercial flights will expand options for travellers between India and Singapore. Singapore announced on Monday that it will launch a VTL with India as part of the country’s efforts to reopen its borders in a safe and calibrated manner and to support people-to-people and business links between the two sides. The VTL will allow quarantine-free travel to Singapore for vaccinated Indian travellers with valid visas and entry approvals. Applications for a Vaccinated Travel Pass (VTP) will open on November 22 and travellers from India are expected to begin entering Singapore under the VTL from November 29. The move is expected to benefit thousands of Indian students, professionals and workers, who have been unable to travel to Singapore because of Covid-related travel restrictions. However, the people cited above said the success of the VTL depends on the resumption of commercial passenger flights between India and Singapore and India. Discussions are ongoing and “good news” is expected soon, they said. Also Read: Singapore allows travellers from India, Bangladesh, Pakistan from Oct 26Currently, the only flights from Singapore allowed to carry passengers to India are government charter relief flights under the Vande Bharat Mission (VBM). Since these flights are chartered repatriation flights, they cannot be designated as VTL flights. The ongoing discussions with Indian authorities are aimed at finalising a temporary, bilateral arrangement to allow for the partial resumption of commercial passenger flights. The Singapore side is also looking forward to the full resumption of air links in line with the bilateral air services agreement as the two countries further open their borders. Singapore started the VTL mechanism on September 8 with two countries – Brunei and Germany. It currently has VTL arrangements with 13 countries, including Australia, Canada, France, Italy, South Korea, the UK and the US. A VTL for Indonesia will become operation from November 29, and similar arrangements for Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE will begin from December 6. Travellers who are fully vaccinated with a World Heal Organization (WHO)-approved vaccine at least two weeks before arrival in Singapore are eligible to travel under the VTL. Singapore recognises both Covishield and Covaxin, the two main jabs used in India’s immunisation programme. They must have accepted proof of vaccination, arrive in Singapore on a designated VTL flight, and have only travelled to or transited via any VTL country or Singapore in the 14 consecutive days before their departure for Singapore. Travellers who are not Singapore citizens or permanent residents must apply for a VTP for entry into Singapore under the VTL. They must also test negative in a PCR test or antigen rapid test (ART) within two days before their departure for Singapore. Travellers will also be required to take PCR test on arrival at Changi airport in Singapore. They must remain in self-isolation while awaiting their the test result. Those who test positive will receive an isolation order. Last month, Singapore began allowing the entry of travellers from six countries, including India, from which travel was barred. This was done after the country’s decision to open VTLs for some countries, while excluding India, had not gone down well with many Indians living and working in the city state. India now has agreements with 99 countries, including Singapore, for mutual recognition of vaccination certificates for people fully vaccinated with a nationally recognised or WHO-approved vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/singapore-in-talks-with-india-for-partial-resumption-of-commercial-flights-101637063428285.html

16-11-2021||India||Will Yesudas be allowed to enter Guruvayur temple? Debate erupts||The Sivagiri Sree Naraynana Trust president Swami Sachidananda’s recent appeal to allow legendary playback singer and Carnatic music exponent KJ Yesudas to enter Sree Krishna temple in Guruvayur has triggered a fresh debate in Kerala. The controversy has erupted as the singer, who is a Roman Catholic, marked six decades of his singing career on Sunday. The temple administration’s board president KB Mohandas said he favoured the move, but the final decision will have to come from the “tantri” or the supreme priest of the temple, who has so far remained silent on the issue. “In most temples, his devotional songs wake up the deity, but it is sad that he was not allowed to enter the Guruvayur temple. We have to undo this long- pending injustice and allow him to pay obeisance to his favourite deity,” said Swami Sachidananda last week. Also Read: Kerala’s Sabarimala temple to reopen from today amid strict Covid-19 normsThe singer, who resides in the US, was not available for a comment on the controversy.Many writers, intellectuals and religious bodies have welcomed the suggestion of the Sivagiri mutt head and appealed to “tantri” Chonas Dineshan Namboodiri to take a favourable decision. The latter has yet to respond. “It is long overdue and he’s more qualified than any of us to have a ‘darshan’,” said poet and filmmaker Sreekumaran Thampi. “If a devotee believes in a particular deity, there should not be any barrier between him and the deity,” said famous Malayalam writer T Padmanabhan. Many Hindu entities such as Viswa Hindu Parishad, Bharatiya Vichar Kendra and Kerala Brahmana Sabha also favour his entry. Yesudas was a regular at the Sabarimala and Kollur Mookambika temples, and has sung some of the most popular devotional songs in his career. It is part of the folklore in southern India that when his mentor Chembai Vaidyanatha Bhagavathar took him to Guruvayur temple in 1950s, the young singer was not allowed to enter the temple at that time because he was a Christian. “It is possible for even insects to enter the temple, but not me. It is sad,” the singer had once said about the issue. In 2017, Sree Padmanabha Swamy temple in the state capital allowed him to conduct a “kacheri” or a devotional music concert.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-yesudas-be-allowed-to-enter-guruvayur-temple-debate-erupts-101637062469520.html
16-11-2021||India||Kerala HC allows swap transplants between non-relatives||The Kerala high court on Monday ruled that swap transplant of organs will be permissible even if the donor and recipient are non-relatives, provided a special reason exists. Passing the judgement justice N Nagaresh recommended changes in the transplantation of human organs and tissues act, 1994.The ruling came on a petition by two patients and two donors, including the wife of one of the patients, who was willing to donate her kidney to ailing husband but couldn’t since her blood group was not a match. Similarly, another patient’s son was willing to donate his kidney to father but they also faced the blood group problem. Though they submitted an application for swap transplant before the transplant authorisation committee, their pleas were rejected forcing them to move the court.The government counsel also justified the action of the committee saying transplant can be allowed among blood relatives or spouses as per the transplantation of human organs and tissues act 1994. But the court found rejection of their request lacked logic or reasoning.“In a case where a citizen’s life can be protected and preserved only by transplant of human organ or tissue, the citizen has a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution to undergo organ transplantation, which right is subject only to the procedure established by law. Any law prescribing procedure for organ transplantation should therefore satisfy the test of reasonableness,” reported Bar Bench, quoting from the judgment. Also Read: Kerala BJP meets governor, wants transfer of case on RSS worker’s death to NIAThe court focused mainly on Section 9 of the Act. While Section 9(3) permits organ transplants between persons who are not near relatives but Section 9(3A) prohibits swap transplantation between not-near relatives. The court said this is illogical and unreasonable. “When Section 9(3) permits transplant of organs to persons not being a near relative, with the prior approval of the committee, there is no logic or rationale to say that swap transaction will not be allowed when members of each pair are not near relatives, even if the committee approves such transaction. Therefore, Section 9(3A) should be read down so as to give full effect to Section 9(3) under which non-near relative transplants are allowed with the approval of the authorisation committee,” it said. The court stated that it was clear that the act contemplates non-near relative organ transplantation and the condition is that the donor should have a special reason for giving authorisation for transplantation and prior approval should be obtained from the committee. The court directed the authorisation committee to consider the applications of the petitioners afresh. Many organ seekers said the new ruling will be a boon to them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-hc-allows-swap-transplants-between-nonrelatives-101637062468157.html

16-11-2021||India||Modi inaugurates Purvanchal Expressway as IAF showcases prowess on emergency airstrip | 10 points||Riding an Air Force C-130 Hercules plane, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday landed at Karwal Kheri in Uttar Pradesh’s Sultanpur district to inaugurate the 340km-long Purvanchal Expressway that also has an airstrip. Built at a cost of ₹22,500 crore, the expressway is aimed at giving a boost to the economic development of the eastern part of Uttar Pradesh.Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath and governor Anandiben Patel, who were present at the event among other leaders, received the Prime Minister on the highway.Here are the top developments on the Purvanchal Expressway event:1. Speaking at the event, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that the highway is a symbol of development in the region. “The expressway will give momentum to development. It is an expressway that will strengthen the state's economy,” he said.2. The Prime Minister noted that the newly built highway will not only benefit eastern UP, but also provide connectivity to the people of Bihar. “It will not only connect the nine districts but connect cities which have potential for development,” Modi said at the inauguration ceremony.3. Meanwhile, chief minister Yogi Adityanath said that Purvanchal Express will become “the lifeline of development in eastern Uttar Pradesh”, adding that this is the trajectory of "new India" under the leadership of Modi.4. The expressway originates from Chaudsarai village in Lucknow district located on Lucknow-Sultanpur road (NH 731) and concludes at Hydaria village on NH 31, about 18 kilometres east of the Uttar Pradesh-Bihar border. It is located about 100km from Lucknow and links the state capital with Ghazipur.5. The key feature of Purvanchal Expressway is the 3.2km-long airstrip to enable landing and take-off of Indian Air Force fighter planes during emergencies. Being an access-controlled expressway, it would also provide benefits like fuel conservation, reduced time and control in pollution level, along with reduction in accidents.6. Targeting past governments in Uttar Pradesh, the Prime Minister said that they “neglected the development of the eastern region” in Uttar Pradesh. “The area was left to the mafia, the same area is now writing the script of the development of UP,” he noted.7. Earlier in the day, former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav had slammed the ruling BJP, claiming that he deserved credit for the work. "The ribbon has come from Lucknow and the scissors came from Delhi to take credit for the Samajwadi Party's work..." Yadav tweeted.8. Massive preparations were made for the event, including dry runs for the air show on the 3.2km emergency airstrip.9. Modi witnessed the airshow by the Indian Air Force on the emergency airstrip, starting with the landing of Mirage 2000. An AN-32 transport aircraft subsequently touched down with special commandos. A flypast by three Kiran Mk II, flanked by 2 Sukhoi 30 jets followed.10. The 6-lane expressway can be expanded to an 8-lane in the future, an official statement read. It is set to become a key economic route in the eastern part of Uttar Pradesh, especially the districts of Lucknow, Barabanki, Amethi, Ayodhya, Sultanpur, Ambedkar Nagar, Azamgarh, Mau and Ghazipur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-inaugurates-purvanchal-expressway-as-iaf-showcases-prowess-on-emergency-airstrip-10-points-101637060829551.html

It earlier this month imposed the stay till November 18 in a response to public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Omkar Mahadeo Supekar and Abhishek Tripathi, PhD candidates at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. The two said the work for the track was undertaken in violation of the Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules.On November 1, the court restrained the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) from constructing the 10-km cycling track bordering Powai Lake after it was informed that such activity would also disrupt the flora and fauna and have an adverse impact on the habitat of Indian marsh crocodiles (a protected species) that live there.The PIL said in 2009, the Supreme Court passed a judgement on safeguarding wetlands and sought directions to BMC to comply with it. BMC said the lake is a man made reservoir and hence the area surrounding it would not come under the purview of the rules.Also Read: Mumbai’s air quality continues to worsen; in ‘poor’ categoryThe high court asked the state to ascertain the claim of BMC. It asked the state and BMC to file their replies within a week. Neither party has yet filed their responses, and asked for additional time. The BMC previously informed the court the project was in public interest.The high court on Tuesday sought the replies by November 30 after which the petitioners may submit their rejoinder by December 8. The matter will be heard next on December 13.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-extends-stay-on-construction-of-cycling-jogging-track-around-powai-lake-101637059648441.html

The party also urged the governor to push the Kerala government to transfer the case to the National Investigation Agency (NIA).Surendran alleged that the Popular Front of India (PFI) and its offshoot Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) were targeting the “leaders of nationalist forces in Kerala.”“BJP delegation met the @KeralaGovernor and urged his excellency to direct the @vijayanpinarayi govt to hand over the Shri.Sanjith's murder case to National Investigation Agency. Islamic terror outfit PFI-SDPI is targeting the leaders of nationalist forces in Kerala,” he tweeted.സഞ്ജിത്തിന്റെ കൊലപാതകം: കേസ് എൻഐഎക്ക് കൈമാറണം: @surendranbjp pic.twitter.com/x7VYA69rx1“We met the governor and requested him to advise CM Pinarayi Vijayan to hand over the case to NIA because the Kerala Police and government officials are supporting the culprits. They have identified the culprits, but no one has been booked till now,” ANI quoted Surendran as saying.Also read | RSS worker hacked to death in Kerala, role of SDPI suspected: PolicePresenting the concerns and demands in a letter following the death of RSS member Sanjith, Surendran said he was “forced to represent the uninterrupted violence unleashed by the Islamic terror outfit Socialist Democratic Party of India, the political arm of Popular Front India in the state.”“The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh's (RSS) Theneri Mandal Boudhik Pramukh Shri. Sanjith (27) was hacked to death in broad daylight at Mambaram, Palakkad, by SDPI terrorists. He was travelling along with his wife in a two-wheeler. The assailants followed Shri Sanjith, hit his motorcycle, and hacked him to death in front of his beloved wife,” he further said.Surendran also claimed that there was an earlier attempt on Sanjith's life, and alleged the involvement of the state government in the murder. “It's very evident from the autopsy report that 'specially trained' assailants are behind this well-planned murder, and the SDPI has got the backing of the ruling dispensation,” he said. “The Kerala Police has miserably failed to provide adequate security to him. It's nothing but criminal negligence,” he added.Citing the case of Koppara Biju, another BJP worker who was allegedly killed by the SDPI on October 31, Surendran said, “The Islamic terror outfits like SDPI-PFI are targeting the leaders of nationalist forces in Kerala. They are trying to destroy the communal harmony in the state.”He urged the governor to “uphold the rule of law” in the state and “ensure the protection of life and property of the commons.”“It is also an open secret that the ruling party CPI(M) and the Islamic terror outfits are now hand in glove in the state. Their common goal is to annihilate nationalist forces in Kerala. Their design has to be resisted and defeated at any cost,” he further said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-bjp-meets-governor-wants-transfer-of-case-on-rss-worker-s-death-to-nia-101637058102455.html
16-11-2021||India||J&K Police say civilian killed in gunbattle counted as ‘over-ground worker’ for harbouring terrorists||The owner of a building, where two terrorists were among four people killed in an exchange of fire with security forces in Srinagar’s Hyderpora on Monday, was being counted as an “over-ground worker (OGW)” as his premises was used to harbour terrorists, the Jammu and Kashmir Police said on Tuesday. Police insisted Altaf Ahmad Dar, 48, the owner, was killed in cross-firing even as his family maintained he was killed in cold blood and used as a human shield. They cited “law and order issues” and said Mudassir Gul, another alleged OGW killed in the gunbattle, and Dar were buried in Handwara, around 70 km away, without the participation of their families. Inspector general (Kashmir) Vijay Kumar said the gunbattle was triggered as security forces launched an operation after receiving input about the presence of two to three terrorists at Hyderpora. “We did not know the exact location. So, the owner of the building...Dar and...Gul, whom its top floor was rented out to, were called to show the location.” Kumar said the forces knocked the doors of the rooms but nobody came out before the terrorists holed up there fired with pistols. “...both the civilians (Dar and Gul) got injured in the firing. The encounter was stopped and efforts were made to rescue the injured persons but they got trapped in the location and died.”Kumar identified one of the two terrorists killed in the gunbattle as Bilal Bhai alias Hyder, who is believed to be a Pakistani. The second terrorist is from Ramban in the Jammu region and his family has been called for identification through photographs. “We have taken DNA samples from bodies of both the militants.”Kumar said they approached Dar and Gul’s families and sought their participation in their burial. “Due to law and order problems, the bodies were not handed over to the families and buried at Handwara.” He added Dar rented out three rooms of his building to Gul, a contractor by profession who also allegedly ran a fake call centre. “There were six cabins at the call centre and also a hideout for the militants in one of the rooms. We recovered a large quantity of material from the place including two pistols, three magazines, six mobiles from militants and four mobile phones from rooms, six computers, six CPUs, maps of the USA, warm clothes, kitchen equipment, drugs, television, injections used by terrorists.”He alleged Gul brought a terrorist to the hideout after the latter shot at a policeman. Kumar said Gul was allegedly running a module of terrorists and bringing them from other parts of Kashmir. “Since the hideout was in the building of Dar... so he will be counted as an overground worker for harbouring militants.” He added they tried to save him but since the firing was going on from both sides, Dar could not be saved. “We regret his killing.”Kumar claimed Gul was a top-ranked OGW and involved in militancy. He added a special team has been formed to analyse records of the call centre. “It was a security and intelligence lapse that on the national highway (in Hyderpora), such hideout was located, where the militants used to visit frequently. We will be looking for similar hideouts.”Dar’s family held a protest on Monday, demanding his body for burial and accused police of killing him.In a tweet, former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti-led People’s Democratic Party demanded a speedy investigation into Dar’s killing. “These allegations are grave and merit speedy investigation. Least@JmuKmrPolice could do is hand over the dead body to the family for a decent burial. Are even dead ones a threat to peace now?”The fresh gunbattle erupted as security forces have intensified anti-insurgency operations since 11 civilians were killed in a spate of targeted attacks last month. A policeman and a salesman were shot dead this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jkpolice-say-civilian-killed-in-gunbattle-counted-as-over-ground-worker-for-harbouring-terrorists-101637056347902.html

BSF Mahila Praharis are the ones who do frisking of females. The allegations of inappropriately touching women by BSF personnel are utterly baseless,” the BSF officer was quoted as saying.The BSF, which was only empowered to take action up to 15 kilometres in Punjab, West Bengal and Assam, has now been authorised to extend its jurisdiction up to 50km without any hurdle or permission either from central or state governments.While Punjab has already registered its protest against the decision, Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has said her government would take up the matter with the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bsf-personnel-touch-women-inappropriately-during-checks-tmc-mla-udayan-guha-101637055844026.html

The Congress has only six MLAs, the MIM has seven and the BJP has three MLAs.Also Read: Purvanchal will become lifeline of east UP, says Yogi at expressway launchInterestingly, Padi Kaushik Reddy who defected from the Congress to the TRS before the recent bye elections to Huzurabad was earlier nominated under the governor’s quota. But, the governor did not accept his nomination saying he did not fulfil the criterion for appointment under social service category.As a result, the TRS president withdrew Reddy’s nomination from the governor’s quota and selected him under the MLAs’ quota.Another surprising choice was that of Banda Prakash Mudiraj, who has three years left for his Rajya Sabha term to finish. This will result in bye election to Rajya Sabha seat shortly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/siddipet-dm-nominated-to-telangana-legislative-council-within-hours-of-retirement-101637053227805.html
16-11-2021||India||US determined to ensure free and open Indo-Pacific: Biden tells Xi during talks||US President Joe Biden told his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on Tuesday of the continued determination of the United States to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific region as the two leaders held a virtual summit lasting more than three hours. Joe Biden made it clear the US will “continue to stand up for its interests and values and, together with our allies and partners, ensure the rules of the road for the 21st century advance an international system that is free, open and fair”, according to a readout issued by the White House. He also discussed the “importance of a free and open Indo-Pacific”, and conveyed to Xi Jinping the “continued determination of the United States to uphold our commitments in the region”. Biden reiterated the importance of freedom of navigation and safe overflight to the region’s prosperity, the readout said. In their first formal meeting since Biden became president in January, the two leaders talked about avoiding conflict and jointly responding to global challenges such as climate change. They also traded strong warnings on the future of Taiwan, with Xi Jinping saying that those backing Taiwan were “playing with fire”. The White House readout reiterated the longstanding US policy that does not recognise Taiwan’s independence but supports the defence of the island. Also Read: Biden celebrates $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill signingJoe Biden said the US remains committed to the “one China” policy but “strongly opposes unilateral efforts to change the status quo or undermine peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait”. China’s state-run media reported after the summit that Xi cautioned Biden against using the issue of Taiwan. “Some people in the US intend to ‘use Taiwan to control China’. This trend is very dangerous and is like playing with fire, and those who play with fire will get burned,” Xi was quoted as saying by Xinhua news agency. “Complete reunification of China is the common aspiration of all sons and daughters of the Chinese nation,” Xi told Biden, adding China will be compelled to take resolute measures if separatist forces working for Taiwan’s independence “provoke us, force our hands or even cross the red line”.The summit was aimed at establishing “guardrails” to prevent conflict between the rival superpowers, and Biden said in his opening remarks that he hoped to have a “candid conversation”. Xi said he was “very happy to see my old friend”, and that the world’s two largest economies need to “increase communication and cooperation”. The summit lasted a “longer than expected” three and a half hours and the conversation was “respectful and straightforward”, a senior US official told reporters. The meeting was held against the backdrop of deteriorating relations and mounting tensions between the US and China, and the White House readout showed Biden had raised concerns about human rights, including the situation in Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong, China’s “unfair” trade practices and its aggressive behaviour across the Indo-Pacific. Biden was “clear about the need to protect American workers and industries from the PRC’s unfair trade and economic practices”, the readout said. He emphasised the priority he places on far-reaching investments at home while aligning with allies and partners abroad to take on contemporary challenges. The readout said the two leaders “discussed the complex nature of relations between our two countries and the importance of managing competition responsibly”. As in previous talks, Biden and Xi covered areas “where our interests align, and areas where our interests, values, and perspectives diverge”. Biden also underscored the “importance of managing strategic risks”. He pointed to the need for “common-sense guardrails to ensure that competition does not veer into conflict and to keep lines of communication open”. At the same time, Biden raised transnational challenges where the interests of the US and China intersect, such as health security. The two leaders also discussed climate change and the important role their countries play in addressing this problem. They discussed the importance of taking measures to address global energy supplies. Biden and Xi also exchanged views on key regional challenges, including North Korea, Afghanistan and Iran. They also discussed ways for the two countries to continue discussions on a number of areas. The two leaders have spoken on phone twice since Biden assumed office in January. With Xi refusing to travel abroad because of the Covid-19 pandemic, a virtual meeting was the only option short of an in-person summit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-determined-to-ensure-free-and-open-indo-pacific-biden-tells-xi-during-talks-101637051307830.html
16-11-2021||India||Collision avoidance manoeuvre performed for Chandrayaan-2: Isro||The lunar orbiter of the Chandrayaan-2 mission, which was successfully deployed in 2019, was moved from its 100-km circular, polar orbit last month to avoid a close approach with NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) near the north pole, Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) said on Monday.This was the first close approach manoeuver that ISRO has undertaken for a space exploration mission. ISRO closely monitors the space for debris and other satellites to avoid a collision. All such manoeuvres have so far been restricted to satellites orbiting the earth, the agency said.Very close conjunction between the Indian and the US orbiters, both of which are in a polar orbit that crosses over both poles of the moon, was expected to occur on October 20 at 11.15am. At that time, the distance between the orbits of the two spacecraft would have been less than 100m. The satellites would have been at a distance of just about 3 km at the time of closest approach, Isro said. This was a very small distance for fast-moving satellites that travel several kilometres in a second.Both Isro and NASA, the American space agency, realised that a manoeuver was needed to mitigate a collision. It was mutually agreed that the Chandrayaan-2 orbiter would be moved to ensure that there is a large separation during their next close conjunction.Also Read: Isro lags behind on revised launch targets for 2021The manoeuver was carried out on October 18 at 8.22pm. “After orbit determination of CH2O (Chandrayaan-2 Orbiter) with post-manoeuvre tracking data, it was reconfirmed that there would be no further close conjunctions with LRO in the near future with the achieved orbit,” Isro said in a statement.The Chandrayaan-2 orbiter was said to have a mission life of seven years. It will be used for the upcoming Chandrayaan-3 mission that will carry only the lander and the rover. The lander rover aboard Chandrayaan 2 mission crash-landed on the lunar surface just 2.1 km from its destination on September 7, 2019. A successful soft-landing would have made India the fourth country after the US, Russia, and China to have successfully landed the celestial object. Israel’s Beresheet that attempted a soft landing also crashed into the lunar surface.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chandrayaan2-orbiter-moved-to-avoid-collision-with-nasa-s-lunar-orbiter-last-month-isro-101637051007640.html

The mob then asked for their names and started to verbally abuse them for moving together despite being from different faiths.

He said CAG’s reports and data will “dictate the history” and provide a roadmap for future governance.“There was a time when the audit was seen with suspicion and dread. CAG versus government had become a common belief and babus (government officials) used to think that CAG finds faults in everything,” he said in his address to a gathering marking the first Audit Diwas to highlight the CAG’s contributions.He added the mindset has changed. “Today, the audit is seen as an important part of value addition. While analysing the government’s work, the CAG has an outsider’s viewpoint and we make systematic improvements with what you (CAG) tell us. We see it as cooperation in the long term.” Modi said while most institutions lose their relevance in three-four decades, CAG has become stronger and more mature with time. “...it is an asset, a heritage for the country. CAG is an institution that has grown in importance and has created a legacy with the passage of time. Every generation needs to cherish it and make it useful for other generations.”The PM cited the banking sector while taking potshots at previous governments. “Due to the lack of transparency in the country’s banking sector earlier, various practices used to take place. As a result, the non-performing assets (NPAs) kept rising. The NPAs were brushed under the carpet. But, we brought out the truth of previous governments before the country.”Also Read | CAG a heritage that every generation should cherish: PM Modi at first Audit DiwasHe also said fairness and transparency play a key role in personal and professional lives. “Only when we identify the problem, we can find a solution to it.” He added they have taken CAG’s concerns positively and took decisions to monetise unused and underused elements. “And these decisions are now showing results in the growing economy.”Modi said there was less government interference. “Today, we are making such a system in which the thinking of ‘Sarkar Sarvam’ ie the interference of the government is decreasing, and your work is also getting easier. Steps like contact-less customs, automatic renewals, faceless assessments, online applications for service delivery, etc have ended unnecessary interference of the government.”He lauded the CAG for use of geospatial data and remote sensing in audit mechanisms. “The stronger and scientific the auditing, the stronger our system will be.”PM said earlier the information was transmitted through stories. “History was written through stories. But today in the 21st century, data is information, and in the coming times, our history will also be seen and understood through data. In the future, data will dictate history,” he said.Modi also unveiled a statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel at the CAG headquarters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/audits-no-longer-seen-with-doubt-modi-101637049567276.html
16-11-2021||India||Kurebhar airstrip is part IAF’s op-plan to counter China||With the Chinese constructing new airports and upgrading the existing ones all along the 3488 km lone Line of Actual Control (LAC), the 3.3-kilometre-long runway at Kurebhar on the newly-inaugurated Purvanchal Expressway is designed to play a major role in fighter and transport operations in case of a worst-case scenario. The Lucknow-Agra expressway also has another airstrip for the same reasons.According to Air Chief Marshal (Retd) S Krishnaswamy, the newly build airstrips on the UP highways are part of Indian Air Force (IAF) plans with the roads specially designed to handle the weight of fighters like Mirage-2000 H and transport planes like C-130 J Hercules. “During 1965 and 1971 wars, the IAF nearly lost planes due to airbases being bombed by Pakistan Air Force planes. Learning from that experience, the Air Force has decided to use these earmarked airstrips on highways to land round the clock using temporary lights, mobile air traffic communications, refuel and take-off after being loaded with armaments,” the former fighter pilot said. Also read | All about Purvanchal Expressway PM Modi will inaugurate todayWhile the IAF remains tight-lipped about its operational plans, the fact is that the two earmarked airstrips in UP are close to airbases so that fuel and armament could be supplied to the landing fighters or transport planes in worst-case scenarios. As a number of Indian airbases have one airstrip, the airstrip on the highways takes the role of the airport in case the former has been hit by enemy planes or missiles. The airbases near the Kurebhar airstrip are Kanpur, Bareilly and Gorakhpur, which are front-line bases to launch against the northern neighbour.The decision to construct these airstrips has been taken considering that PLA Air Force is building underground shelters for its fighters across the LAC in Kashgar, Hotan, Damxung, Lhasa, Shigatse, Ngari-Gar Gunsa, Bangda and Nyinmgchi dual-purpose airports with new airports coming up in Tashikorgan, Purang, Tingri and Lhuntse. Also watch | Why PM calls inauguration of 341-km long Purvanchal Expressway ‘special’

These states and UTs include Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, UP, Punjab, Bihar, Odisha, Tamilnadu, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Haryana.According to an official statement, the CBI on November 14 registered 23 separate cases against 83 accused on allegations regarding online child sexual abuse and exploitation. More details will be out once the searches are over, an official told news agency ANI. In 2019, the CBI set up an online child sexual abuse and exploitation (OCSAE) prevention/investigation unit as a part of its special crime zone. The OCSAE unit is responsible for collecting and disseminating information regarding the publication and transmission of information relating to online child sexual abuse and exploitation.With the help of this unit, the CBI in 2020 was able to arrest an Uttar Pradesh government engineer for allegedly sexually exploiting about 50 minor children for the last decade and selling videos and photographs of nefarious acts on the darknet to other paedophiles across the world.Rambhawan, the accused, is alleged to have preyed upon the children between 5 -16 years of Chitrakoot, Banda and Hamirpur districts of the state, officials told Hindustan Times in November last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-conducts-searches-across-india-on-allegations-of-online-child-sexual-abuse-101637046316901.html

Nayak’s wife Sasmita alleged that a man from Dewanpatna in Balipatna block of Khurda district was their largest borrower who had bought maize worth ₹16 lakh from her husband a year ago on credit but had refused to pay for it. She said they approached police several times but the cops did not register a case against the businessman, rendering the couple helpless.She said the businessman last visited her house on October 31 and threatened her of dire consequences if Nayak persisted with the demand, forcing the couple to approach the local police station.“When we lodged the complaint at Khurda Town police station, the cops there asked us to come on November 12 and said they will also summon the businessman. We went again on November 12, but the businessman did not come. The police then asked us to come on November 13. However, when the police telephoned the businessman the same day, he said he could not come due to medical emergency and will come only after November 20,” Nayak’s wife said.She added that after realising that the businessman was only trying to evade them, the couple requested the police to register a case but the cops refused. On November 14, they day when lenders visited Nayak’s house, asking him to pay up his dues, he left home and later told his wife that he was going to take his own life, Sasmita said.Also Read: Odisha tribal boatman mortgages his land to build 100-metre long bridge“In the evening, my husband went to a forested area and before hanging himself, he sent his photograph through WhatsApp,” his wife Sasmita said.Sasmita said the local police refused to even accompany her to the place where her husband had allegedly hung himself.

16-11-2021||India||Centre makes sanitation workers’ safety component of 2022 Swachh Survekshan||The Union housing and urban affairs ministry has made sanitation workers’ safety an important component of its Swachh Survekshan 2022 to prevent deaths due to the cleaning of sewers and septic tanks. An official said the aim is to encourage cities and towns to adopt mechanised cleaning and also plan for the safety and welfare of people involved in the work. “We have now scaled up the challenge by incorporating it in the Swachh Survekshan 2022. The idea is to have a common 24x7 helpline number where people can call for getting their septic tanks cleaned. Ideally, workers should not enter to clean the sewers. But if they have to enter, they should be provided proper gear and it should be done under supervision,” said the official, who did not want to be named.Setting up of Responsible Sanitation Authority (RSA) under district magistrates, operationalising a 24x7 helpline number (14420) for mechanised cleaning, training, and rehabilitation of workers, etc are some of the new key pointers on which close to 4,600 urban local bodies (ULBs) will be assessed, said another official.Last year, the ministry launched SafaiMitra Suraksha Challenge, a pilot initiative, in 246 cities to encourage civic agencies to adopt mechanised cleaning of sewer and septic tanks and the safety of workers. The results of the challenge will be announced on November 19.In February, the government told the Parliament that 340 people have died while cleaning sewers or septic tanks in the last five years. It informed the Parliament in July that no death due to manual scavenging has been reported in India. But 941 workers died while cleaning sewers and septic tanks in the last three decades, it added.According to the ministry, the helpline (14420) is currently operational in 345 cities; 31 States/Union territories have established the RSA, and 210 cities are having the Sanitation Response Units.Also Read: At first Audit Diwas, PM Modi praises CAG, slams previous regimes for NPAsFor Swachh Survekshan, only urban local bodies (ULBs) can participate. But there are several cities where the sewerage system is managed by agencies under the state governments.A third official said in cities such as Delhi, Chennai, Bengaluru, Shimla, Greater Hyderabad, Guwahati, etc the sewerage system is under parastatal bodies. The ministry is trying to bring the bodies involved in the cleaning of sewers in states under the Swachh Survekshan purview. “Currently, we are collecting data regarding sewage management, even in cities where it is under parastatal bodies, from ULBs. But in some cases, we do not get the complete information due to a lack of coordination as there are different agencies involved. We are exploring ways to bring parastatal bodies on board under Swachh Survekshan. Though we can only assess the ULBs, a mechanism has to be worked out to assess the work done on Survekshan,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-makes-sanitation-workers-safety-component-of-2022-swachh-survekshan-101637043807216.html

What we know so far||Senior Congress leader Salman Khurshid’s new book on Ayodhya has caused quite the stir for drawing a parallel between “Hindutva” and radical Islamist groups. Khurshid has been criticised within the ranks of his own party by senior leaders Ghulam Nabi Azad and Harish Rawat, with Azad calling the comparison “factually wrong” and an “exaggeration”.However, the former Union minister has also received support from his party colleagues, with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi stating that Hinduism and Hindutva are "different things" and slammed the ideology of the BJP-RSS alleging it has spread hatred in India.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) hit out at Gandhi over his remark, alleging that he and his and his party have a "pathological hatred" of Hinduism.An injunction suit has been filed before a Delhi court seeking to stop the publication, circulation and sale of Khurshid’s book ‘Sunrise over Ayodhya’ by right-wing group Hindu Sena's president Vishnu Gupta. Gupta claimed in his petition that the launch was timed to polarise minorities ahead of the Uttar Pradesh state assembly election next year.Khurshid’s house in Nainital’s Ramgarh was allegedly vandalised on Monday and the police have booked 20 people in connection with the incident. Police said a mob of around 20 people from a hardline local Hindu group gathered outside Khurshid's house and "they shouted slogans, threw stones, broke several windows, ransacked (the entry) and set fire (to a door)," a police official told reporters.Khurshid criticised the act on social media. "Shame is too ineffective a word," he said, adding that Monday’s incident “cannot be Hinduism”.Congress leader Shashi Tharoor criticised the incident as “shameful”. “Salman Khurshid is a statesman who has done India proud in international forums & always articulated a moderate, centrist, inclusive vision of the country domestically. The mounting levels of intolerance in our politics should be denounced by those in power,” Tharoor tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/controversy-over-salman-khurshid-s-hindutva-isis-comparison-what-we-know-so-far-101637042875052.html

Tripura’s information and cultural affairs minister Sushanta Chowdhury claimed on Monday the journalists who visited the state to cover reported incidents of violence against minorities were seeking to create communal disturbances. His remarks came hours after HW News journalists Samriddhi Sakunia and Swarna Jha were granted bail by a local court in Tripura on Monday following their arrest for allegedly spreading communal hatred. “They came here as agents of a political party with an intention to affect communal peace and cause a riot-like situation. They came here introducing them as journalists to provoke people with fake footage,” Chowdhury told reporters at Agartala’s civil secretariat. He didn’t name any political party in his accusations.Also Read: CPI(M) to hold countrywide protests on Dec 1 against attacks on minoritiesPointing to the recent violence in Amravati, Maharashtra, the Tripura minister alleged that Sakunia posted fake photos and footage, which sparked a protest in Amravati. “This doesn’t suit a journalist.

That’s why, they were booked and as there is an internal security issue, police wanted to know where they came from and with what purpose,” he said. The minister accused them of not cooperating with the police over questioning in connection with a case lodged against them at Kakraban police station. “They told the police that they will take a flight to New Delhi from Agartala. But then they escaped to Nilambazar in Assam without any intimation. If they are journalists, why did they need to escape?” Chowdhury said. Chowdhury claimed that a certain group of people was conspiring to destabilise the state government and to bring a party from outside to power in Tripura. “People disguising as salesmen are visiting houses and brainwashing people against the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and chief minister [Biplab Kumar Deb]. We appeal to people to be aware of such rumours,” he said. Sakunia and Jha were on Sunday booked in connection with two separate cases - in Fatikroy, Unakoti district, and in Kakraban, Gomati district - for alleged criminal conspiracy and for spreading communal hatred when they visited Tripura to cover reported incidents of vandalism of religious structures last month. They were served a notice to appear before police in seven days in connection with the first case, and they were arrested in connection with the second case. While they were on way to Silchar, Assam Police detained them in Karimganj district on Sunday following instructions from Tripura Police, who later arrested them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/agents-of-political-party-tripura-minister-criticises-journalists-out-on-bail-101637042606768.html

A division bench of justices N Kotiswar Singh and Malasri Nandi passed the order last week in Puspa Rani Dhar’s favour.The tribunal said the documents Dhar produced failed to establish her link with her father Hirendra Nath Paul while declaring her as “foreigner and deportable”. Dhar moved the high court in 2018 against the order.The tribunal based its “finding and opinion” primarily on a certificate issued to Dhar’s late husband, Mrinal Kanti Dhar, by railway authorities in January 2003. The certificate showed the petitioner’s husband served in the Northeast Frontier Railways from 1962 till his retirement in 2003. It also mentioned Puspa Rani, born in January 1952, as his wife. But the foreigners’ tribunal termed the document as irrelevant and rejected it.“We fail to understand, how the said document can be said to be irrelevant and liable to be rejected. Rather it shows that the petitioner who was married to the aforesaid Mrinal Kanti Dhar, was serving in the Indian Railways and as such, there is a remote possibility of the petitioner being a foreigner and this document will show, in absence of any contrary proof, that in probability the petitioner would be an Indian as an Indian is most unlikely to marry a foreigner,” the high court order said.Also Read: 2 women journalists, arrested for reporting on Tripura violence, granted bailThe court said the tribunal accepted a certificate issued in Calcutta by Bengal Medical Union in 1966 to the petitioner’s father. “This document would indicate that if her father was in Bengal in 1966, this will be strong corroborative evidence that the petitioner is an Indian,” the order said. “...the petitioner has been able to produce sufficient evidence before the learned tribunal to show that she is an Indian citizen and not a foreigner.”Anita Verma, the special counsel for foreigners’ tribunals, argued even if she was declared an Indian, the petitioner should first register herself with the local foreigners’ registration office. But the court rejected this saying the petitioner was “not a foreigner at any point of time”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-sets-aside-foreigners-tribunal-order-declares-assam-woman-indian-101637042546760.html

We will be able to find out a solution only if we identify the problems,” the PM said.Speaking about monetisation of unused and underused assets, he said it was a brave decision that helped revive the economy. “The move is being discussed and welcomed across the world,” he added. Earlier, CAG GC Murmu said the particular day was chosen as the first Audit Diwas due to its historical significance.“Under the Government of India Act 1858, after the merging of audit departments of Bengal, Madras & Bombay presidencies, on November 16, 1860, the first Auditor-General took charge,” Murmu said.A PTI report said Audit Diwas was being celebrated to mark the historic origin of the institution of CAG and the contribution it had made to the governance, transparency and accountability over the past several years. The institution was founded in 1858.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cag-a-heritage-that-every-generation-should-cherish-pm-modi-at-1st-audit-diwas-101637041289634.html

16-11-2021||India||‘They want to control everything as if they are going to rule for 100 years’||Opposition parties have opposed the two ordinances that empower the Centre to post the chiefs of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for up to five years. Mallikarjun Kharge, the Opposition leader in Rajya Sabha, spoke to Sunetra Choudhury about the ordinances. Edited excerpts:What is objectionable about the ordinances?Firstly, why are they issuing these ordinances now? Secondly, why is it necessary to extend the period (tenures) from two years to five years? Why is it so urgent? Is it in the interest of the economy in the country? Is the law and order of the country going to collapse? Or, any war is going there? Why? If they could have waited, they would have taken the route of the Parliament and could have put forth a bill that could have been thoroughly discussed. It would have been better to go as per our parliamentary rules and procedure. They want to show that they can do anything because they have the majority. They are already using CBI, ED, and other agencies.The government has already taken ED under the home ministry whereas previously it was under the finance ministry. Even the Co-operation department was taken away from Agriculture. Now, you are extending the period of CBI and ED chiefs for five years. This means that they want their choice of people for a longer time so that they can harass the common people, the opposition parties, NGOs, and journalists and do what they’re doing with Pegasus and other agencies to get the information.We have objected to this since we are a democratic country. In the past, no other Prime Minister has hurried through issuing ordinances. So far, hundreds of Ordinances have been issued and now two more Ordinances. They are not going through democratic procedures. They are killing democracy and they are destroying the constitution. Ultimately, they want to become dictators and they are doing this through autocratic ways.Did the government do this to extend the term of ED director Sanjay Kumar Mishra?I am not talking about one individual. If the government extends the tenure to five years, naturally their choice of people will get an extension. But what is the necessity for extending the tenure? Is it in the interest of the country? Is it in the interest of law and order?They point out the FBI director has a 10-year tenure and that the extension in the tenure will help the CBI director to oversee a case from investigation to conviction...Now, over 70 years after independence, suddenly they find a fault in the agencies. I do not agree with this because they want their choice of people who have longevity.Also Read: When CBI recommended 5-year tenure for its chief but govt rejected itHow will the opposition protest?We have to raise it in the Parliament and we will ask them to review it. We will also ask other opposition parties to stay united on this because the Centre is killing the democracy and they are not following the Constitutional rules and procedures. For this reason, we must be united because it is not a question of one party. It is for the survival of democracy. Also, for the institutions that are independently used to probe, nobody is to influence them. But now, day by day these independent institutions are deteriorating and are being misused. They are used to harass people including political opponents. Therefore, it is bad. People who are not favourable to them, they twist their arms.Have not governments always wanted to control the CBI and other agencies? It was during the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) rule that the CBI was called a “caged parrot”...That is wrong. The UPA did not behave like that. You people are saying that ED was taken from Finance department to Home department earlier and Cooperation department was taken to Home department. Can you show such instances? Simply saying that you have done like that so we are also doing like that. You are changing the departments.They want to control everything as if they are going to rule for 100 years. It means that you do not believe in democracy. You want to destroy democracy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/they-want-to-control-everything-as-if-they-are-going-to-rule-for-100-years-101637037146736.html

16-11-2021||India||When CBI recommended 5-year tenure for its chief but govt rejected it||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) recommended a five-year tenure for its director in 2012, but the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government rejected the idea. The then CBI director A P Singh argued the agency needs continuity at the top so that crucial corruption probes can be taken to logical conclusions considering many high-profile cases linger on for years. He argued by the time an important development takes place, a new director joins the agency.A single 10-year term for the Federal Bureau of Investigation director was also cited to bolster the argument.A select committee of the Rajya Sabha examined the matter and rejected it. It said the CBI director, as well as its prosecution wing chief, shall have a fixed term of two years.Having a high-powered committee comprising the Prime Minister, Leader of Opposition, and Chief Justice of India, to select the CBI director was another key recommendation the agency made at that time. This panel has appointed CBI chiefs since 2014.Singh refused to comment but a former CBI officer said having fixed five-year tenure for the director would have been ideal but the latest arrangement of having three extensions of one year each after a two-year term is also welcome.Also Watch: Why ordinance on CBI and ED Directors’ tenure has outraged many“Only problem is that the CBI and ED (Enforcement Directorate) directors will now actively want their tenure extended every year after two-year fixed terms, which may hit the objectivity and government line will be toed,” said the officer, who did not want to be named. This officer added that since the ED director can now also get a total of five-year tenure, the selection for the post should also be done by a high-powered committee on the lines of the CBI director. Currently, the ED chief is selected by a panel led by the chief vigilance commission and comprises vigilance commissioners, Union personnel, and revenue secretaries.Two ordinances introduced on Sunday empowered the Centre to post the chiefs of CBI and ED for up to five years – with an extension up to three years beyond the fixed tenure of two years. The decision is likely to benefit current ED chief Sanjay Kumar Mishra, who completes his tenure this week. The Supreme Court in September asked the government not to give him any further extension. Opposition parties have slammed the ordinances as illegal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/when-cbi-recommended-5-year-tenure-for-its-chief-but-govt-rejected-it-101637034506169.html

GMC commissioner Devashish Sharma issued the order on Saturday, citing multiple complaints lodged by people flagging alleged malpractices at unisex salons, beauty parlours and spas. The GMC said in its order that the activities in question were “detrimental to civic society”, and the corporation was “duty-bound to respect public morality and the laws which govern a civic society”. According to the new rules, parlours and spas in Guwahati can’t have separate rooms or chambers, their main entrances have to be transparent, and members of the opposite sex are barred from giving massage service. The GMC’s order also said the establishments in question should only have qualified therapists. Steam baths are allowed, but members of the opposite sex can’t assist clients. Also, parlours and spas have to register the customers’ addresses and contact numbers. Also Read: IOA elections to be held in Guwahati on December 19“We took this action after deliberating for a month following complaints received from several apartment owners that illegal and unregistered massage parlours and spas were being operated on the premises,” said GMC commissioner Sharma. He said some of the complaints were found to be genuine. Sharma said nearly 60% of beauty parlours and spas in Guwahati were not registered and operating illegally.“We are not into moral policing, but these businesses have to be registered and have to follow practices that don’t pollute society. Establishments that are genuine and operate professionally don’t have to worry about the new rules,” said Sharma. The GMC has given beauty parlours, hair cutting saloons and spas in the city a month’s time to comply with the new rules. Licences of those found violating the regulations won’t be renewed, Sharma said. “We welcome the regulations as they will help remove a bad image about the profession. But the GMC should have talked to us before finalising the rules. Some rules, such as not having separate rooms, might be a problem for our women clients,” said the proprietor of a Guwahati-based spa, wishing not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/respect-public-morality-guwahati-bans-cross-gender-massage-at-spas-parlours-101637033066049.html

16-11-2021||India||Supreme Court to hear plea on Central Vista land use today||The Supreme Court will on Monday hear a petition challenging the change in the land use of a plot where the new official residences of the vice president and the Prime Minister are stipulated as part of the ambitious Centra Vista project in Delhi.The case will be heard by a bench of justice AM Khanwilkar and justice CT Ravikumar, who had deferred the matter for Tuesday on October 29. The plea, filed by lawyer Rajeev Suri, is questioning the change of land use of a public recreational spot in Central Vista for purposes of constructing residences.First announced in September 2019, the Central Vista project envisages a new Parliament with a built-up area of around 60,000 square metres and expanded seating for over 1,200 members of both Houses, along with 51 Union ministries in 10 buildings.It is to be constructed by August 2022, when the country is set to celebrate its 75th Independence Day. The common Central Secretariat is to be built by 2024 under the project that covers a 3-km stretch from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate in the national capital.Earlier, the bench SC bench asked the central government to file a short affidavit on the issue.In an October 25 hearing, the counsel appearing for the petitioner said that authorities have not demonstrated any public interest as far as the change in land use from recreational to residential for the plot is concerned. To this, solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, told the bench that official residences for the vice president and the Prime Minister are stipulated on the plot.Mehta said the recreational area could be shifted but he also cited security concerns considering that Parliament would come up there. The bench then asked the Centre's response on the raised matter.In January this year, the top court, by 2:1 majority, held that the grant of environmental clearance and the notification for change in land use for construction of new Parliament building under the project was valid.The top court's verdict came on several pleas, including those against various permissions given to the project by authorities including the grant of environmental clearance and the nod to change of land use.In June this year, the top court dismissed a separate plea challenging the Delhi High Court order which had rejected a petition seeking to halt Central Vista construction work in view of the coronavirus pandemic.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-to-hear-plea-on-central-vista-land-use-today-101637026200187.html

"The accused persons took advantage of the weak economic condition and illiteracy among the members of the tribal community to lure them into conversion to Islam over a long period," the official said. Almost all the nine accused are local residents barring one who is currently residing in London and identified as Fefdawala Haji Abdul, who collected funds from abroad for the purpose, he said. "The illegal religious conversion activity by Muslim fundamentalists using funds collected from abroad was going on for a long time at the village. The accused persons lured the Vasava Hindu community members by offering them money and other help to convert them fraudulently to Islam by entering into a criminal conspiracy hatched to spread animosity between members of two communities and affect peace," Bharuch police said in a statement. A native of Nabipur in the Bharuch district, who currently resides in London, Fefdawala Haji Abdul, used to collect funds from abroad for religious conversion, it said. The nine persons were booked under the Gujarat Freedom of Religion (Amendment) Act, as well as sections 120 (B) (criminal conspiracy), 153 (B)(C) (act likely to cause disharmony), and 506 (2) (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fir-against-9-for-converting-over-100-tribals-to-islam-in-gujarat-101637017891071.html
16-11-2021||India||SC raps Centre over transfer of tax cases from high courts||The Supreme Court turned down the Union government’s plea to transfer a clutch of cases relating to reassessment notices sent under the Income Tax Act from various high courts to the top court, observing that the Centre must stop this “practice of convenience”.“Is it a matter of convenience for the Union government to bring all matters to the Supreme Court? You want all the cases to come here and, in the process, you ensure no other court can proceed. Aren’t the high courts also constitutional courts? Why can’t they hear and decide a case?” a bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana asked additional solicitor general (ASG) Balbir Singh.Singh, appearing for the central board of direct taxes (CBDT), had requested the Supreme Court to transfer to itself several hundreds of petitions pending before the high courts of Bombay and Calcutta on the validity of notices issued to several entities under the old provisions of Section 148 of the Income Tax Act, 1961. The ASG emphasised there are more than one lakh notices issued under Section 148 of the old Act.Singh maintained that the high courts have stayed the revenue department’s notices in all these cases and that an authoritative ruling by the top court could help the situation since different high courts may end up laying down different judgments.But the bench, which also included justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli, was livid at the Centre’s attempt to bring all the cases to the top court.“Why do you do this in every case? This has become a forum of convenience for the central government, we think. You also force all the litigants to come to the Supreme Court who want high courts to decide. We will have to stop this practice,” the bench told Singh.“You withdraw this and seek your remedies before the high court. We will not entertain it here. We will rather have the advantage of the high court judgment,” said the bench, compelling the ASG to withdraw the transfer petition.The Centre earlier this year moved the Supreme Court seeking transfer of several batch of cases relating to separate aspects of the 2021 Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules from various high courts to the top court.In March, the government sought transfer of cases relating to regulating content of releases on over-the-top platforms such as Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hotstar, and Zee5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-raps-centre-over-transfer-of-tax-cases-from-highcourts-101637013316951.html
16-11-2021||India||Centre front-loads states’ share to boost spending||The Union government has frontloaded devolution of revenue to states by doubling the November instalment to ₹95,082 crore, and has that states’ revenue shares is not affected by the recent cut in central excise on petrol and diesel as the hit will be taken by the Centre, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman told them at a meeting on Monday.She said the money has been given upfront to states so that they can frontload their capital expenditure and give infrastructure push that would propel economic growth, which is already upbeat. “With this, states will have more money in their hands so that they can consider spending it for infrastructure creation,” she said.This is an advance release, which will be adjusted in the month of March, the end of the current financial year, she added.Sitharaman said that the meeting—first of its kind and convened less than 100 days before the Union Budget—aims to maintain a robust economic growth that has been witnessed post-pandemic.“We need to sustain the growth,” she said, adding that the government wants to take it as close as possible to a double-digit growth.India’s gross domestic product (GDP) saw a 24.4% contraction in the first quarter ended June 2020. The economy plunged into technical recession (negative growth for two subsequent quarters) as the subsequent quarter (Q2 FY21) contracted 7.3%.The economy, however, recorded a V-shaped recovery as a result of several policy measures, including a ₹20.97 lakh crore stimulus package. That led to a positive 0.5% growth in the third quarter and 1.6% in the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2021.The current fiscal year started with a record 20.1% expansion in the first quarter ended June 2021, signalling a strong revival in business activities.On uniform pricing of petrol and diesel across the country, she said the decision on applicability of tax rates has to be taken by states in the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council. Commenting on the impact of recent cuts in central excise on petrol and diesel, finance secretary TV Somanathan said: “Entire reduction is borne by central government ... it is revenue loss to the centre [alone] and no loss to devolution to the state government.”Sitharaman said the meeting was essentially convened to seek ideas from states to further boost investments and manufacturing as states are in the “forefront” of business activities. She said states did make several observations related to the forthcoming budget, but there was no specific discussion on fund allocations. “In general, there were a lot of observations. No particular thing about the budget... There were a lot of discussions in general about so many things,” she said.The meeting was attended by chief ministers of Assam, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Puducherry, Sikkim, Tripura, and Uttar Pradesh. Deputy chief ministers of Arunachal Pradesh, Bihar, and Delhi also attended the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-front-loads-states-share-to-boost-spending-101637013095879.html
16-11-2021||India||Spikes in delhi’s pollution have direct link to rise in farm fires||There can be no arguing that stubble burning is a major contributor to the bad air in Delhi at this time of the year, just as there can be no arguing that Delhi’s average annual air quality index (AQI) is in the poor or the upper end of the moderate category.This may seem to be at odds with the claims made in an affidavit submitted by the environment ministry in the Supreme Court that downplays the contribution of stubble burning to the Capital’s bad air. The affidavit is clearly an example of the damage averages can wreak on policy making when used without context.The facts are thus.One, Delhi always has bad air.In 2018, the average AQI was 225.4; in 2019, it was 214; in 2020, it was 185.2; and in 2021, till November 14, it was 188.2. The number of stations measuring AQI across these years is not the same, but the metric is still a good indicator of how good (or bad, in this case) Delhi’s air was.Two, stubble burning just serves to push the AQI into the very poor (300-400) or severe (400-500 ) category.For instance, between October 20 and November 14 this year, Delhi’s AQI has been in the severe zone on seven days. On each of these days, the contribution of farm fires to Delhi’s PM2.5 contribution was between 26%-48%.This isn’t an aberration.For instance, according to a paper, “Objective evaluation of stubble emission of North India and quantifying its impact on air quality of Delhi”, in the first fortnight of November 2018, the contribution of stubble burning (biomass) to AQI was 9, 10, 30, 58, 29, 9, 10, 8, 7, 13, 22, 24, 5, 9, and 29%. That’s an average of around 18%.Three, Delhi doesn’t see that many days when the AQI is severe.Given that Delhi’s AQI has been in the severe category on a maximum of 25 days (in one year) in the period between 2016 and 2020 according to an affidavit filed by the environment ministry in the Supreme Court – including days when AQI was very poor, the number was 64 in 2020 and 80 in 2019 – it is clear that stubble burning has a clear impact on the Capital’s air. Long-term interventions – more public transport, better garbage disposal, moves to combat desertification, electric vehicles – will be needed to get Delhi’s average AQI down, but it is clear that short-term interventions (combating stubble burning, for one) will be needed to keep it from slipping into the very poor and severe categories.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/spikes-in-delhi-s-pollution-have-direct-link-to-rise-in-farm-fires-101637010002158.html
16-11-2021||India||Virtual hearing option open for lawyers during pregnancy: SC||The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to examine a petition to keep the option of virtual hearings open for the benefit of working women lawyers who have to sacrifice their careers during pregnancy, or while providing maternal care to their newborns.A petition by a Delhi-based lawyer Esha Mazumdar, contending that virtual courts offering working women a balance to manage both professional and personal duties, said: “An option ought to be given to women lawyers to opt for virtual hearing during pregnancy and thereafter for at least 26 weeks till the women are sufficiently independent to start appearing physically before Courts.”It further stated, “Since right to pregnancy is a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution, every effort ought to be made to see that the fundamental right is not violated only because a woman is constrained to choose between pregnancy and her career.”A bench of justices L Nageswara Rao and BR Gavai agreed to hear the petition. Two petitions seeking continuation of virtual hearing before the Supreme Court and high courts are pending consideration before the top court. The court issued notices to the Centre, the Bar Council of India, the Supreme Court of India and all high courts, and posted the matter for hearing on December 6 along with the two pending petitions.However, the bench sounded caution by saying, “We want courts to open up first and thereafter we want to create exceptions... We must consider that all this was not an issue before the pandemic. Tomorrow teachers will approach the Court to provide for right to teach through virtual classroom. We cannot allow lawyers as a separate class.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/virtual-hearing-option-open-for-lawyers-during-pregnancy-sc-101637007688122.html

Thousands of people gathered from nearby areas to pay tribute to the commanding officer in Raigarh town.Higher Education Minister Umesh Patel, along with four legislators and senior police officers were present during the final rites.Earlier on Monday, the mortal remains of Colonel Viplav Tripathi, his wife Anuja and son Abeer, were brought to their hometown Raigarh in Chhattisgarh on Monday. A special plane of the Indian Air Force carrying mortal remains of the martyred colonel, his wife and son, landed at an airstrip in Raigarh at 12:42 pm.Tripathi’s younger brother, Lieutenant Colonel Anay Tripathi, state’s higher education minister Umesh Patel, Raigarh MP Gomti Sai, local MLAs, district administration and police officials were present at the airstrip in Raigarh district.The mortal remains were taken in an open flower-decked truck to Colonel Tripathi’s home and subsequently kept at the Riagarh’s Ramleela ground for the public to pay homage.Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel also expressed his condolences after the arrival of mortal remains in Raigarh on Monday.On Sunday, Colonel R S Thakur of the Assam Rifles, four other officers and 45 personnel reached Raigarh to express condolences to the family members.Tripathi’s father Subhash Tripathi is a senior journalist and editor of local Hindi daily ‘Dainik Bayar’ and his grandfather Kishori Mohan Tripathi was a freedom fighter.Born on May 30, 1980, Viplav went to the Sainik School Rewa (Madhya Pradesh) after passing class V at a school in Raigarh town.After schooling, Viplav got admission to the National Defence Academy (NDA), Khadakwasla and then joined the Indian Military Academy (IMA), Dehradun, Patnaik said.In 2001, he was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Kumaon Regiment in Ranikhet. He later passed a command course from the Defence Service Staff College (DSSC) Wellington.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/last-rites-of-colonel-his-family-performed-101637007285087.html
16-11-2021||India||When CBI recommended 5-year tenure for its chief. It was rejected||NEW DELHI: A recommendation by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to have five-year tenure for its director was rejected during the tenure of the United Progressive Alliance-II government in 2012.The recommendation was made by CBI under former director AP Singh, who argued at that time that the agency needs continuity of the CBI director so that crucial corruption probes can be taken to logical conclusions. He reasoned that many high-profile cases linger on for years, and by the time an important development takes place, a new director joins the agency.The matter was examined by the select committee of the Rajya Sabha which considered the Lokpal and Lokayukta Bill, 2011 but the committee didn’t accept the recommendation and decided to continue with a two-year term allowed to the CBI director under the Supreme Court ruling in the Jain hawala case.Another key recommendation made by the CBI at that time was to have high powered committee comprising the Prime Minister, Leader of Opposition and Chief Justice of India, which will select the CBI director, a recommendation that was made by other prominent dignitaries such as the former Chief Justice of India JS Verma.Since 2014, all the CBI chiefs have been appointed by this high-powered panel. Singh refused to comment when contacted by HT on Monday. However, a former high-ranking officer in CBI said “having fixed five-year tenure for the director would have been ideal but the latest arrangement of having three extensions of one year each after fixed two-year term is also welcome”. “The only problem is that CBI and ED directors will now actively want their tenure extended every year after a two-year fixed term, which may impact their objectivity,” said this former officer, who didn’t want to be named. This officer added that since ED directors can now also get a total of five years, their selection should also be done by a high-powered committee on the lines of CBI director. Currently, the ED chief is selected by a panel led by the central vigilance commissioner and comprising vigilance commissioners and secretaries of the department of personnel and training, and the revenue department.Two ordinances were brought in on Sunday by the Centre empowering itself to post the chiefs of CBI and ED for up to five years – with extension up to three years beyond their fixed tenure of two years. The decision is likely to benefit current ED chief Sanjay Kumar Mishra, who completes his tenure this week. The Supreme Court in September asked the government not to give the ED director any further extension. However, the ordinance gives him chance at two more years to head the anti-money laundering agency. Opposition parties have slammed the ordinances terming them illegal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/when-cbi-recommended-5-year-tenure-for-its-chief-it-was-rejected-101637005824909.html

The crime was allegedly committed on May 10, a week after the assembly election results were announced on May 2, said an official, seeking anonymity.Police, however, claimed that a rape incident had taken place on May 9 but was not linked to any post-poll violence.“There was an incident of rape in the district on May 9. The police recorded the statement of the survivor and arrested three men. They were produced before a local court. This was not linked to any post-poll violence. No complaint about any attempted rape was received by the police on May 10 or after that date,” K S Rajkumar, Murshidabad district police superintendent, said.Taking a swipe at the state government, Bharatiya Janata Party state chief Sukanta Majumdar said: “Mamata Banerjee’s government has set a record in underreporting crime and not accepting complaints. Nobody listened to the survivor at Nabagram. The CBI will unearth the truth.”The ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC), however, said the CBI should be allowed to probe the case first. “The CBI has filed so many cases. This is one more.

It is the only attack helicopter in the world which can land and take-off at an altitude of 5,000 m with considerable load of weapons and fuel,” the statement said.HAL has not yet got the LCH contract from the defence ministry for supplying the helicopters to the IAF and army, but that has not stopped it from manufacturing the helicopters and delivering them to the two services. Its handing over to IAF indicates the contract will be signed soon.HAL is awaiting a contract for 15 limited series production (LSP) helicopters and expects follow-on orders as the IAF and the army have a combined projected requirement of 160 LCHs. Of the initial 15 LSP helicopters approved for purchase by the defence acquisition council (DAC) – India’s apex defence procurement body – 10 are for IAF and five for the army.The PM will also on November 19 lay the foundation stone of a new ₹400-crore facility of Bharat Dynamics Ltd in the Jhansi node of the UP defence industrial corridorThe PM’s participation in the event and his handing over the locally developed military equipment to the armed forces is a message to the world and the country that “we have taken giant steps towards self-reliance in defence,” said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General BS Jaswal (retd).The line-up of events in Jhansi includes the PM dedicating to the country 100 new Sainik Schools and he will also launch the National Cadets Corps (NCC) alumni association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-hand-over-lchs-to-iaf-on-nov-19-101637004621863.html
16-11-2021||India||Karnataka seeks Centre’s aid to keep up growth||The Karnataka government on Monday sought assistance from the Centre to keep the momentum of economic growth in the southern state, including a clear policy on forest and environment, special incentives for special sectors, institutional finance for new-age technology and speedy dispute resolution, among others.Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai participated in the meeting chaired by the Union finance minister with the chief ministers of various states on Monday. Bommai also holds the finance portfolio of Karnataka. “A clear policy on forest and environmental clearance is required. Special sectors need special incentives. Townships are being developed in SEZs, which require amendments to the laws of urban local bodies and rural local bodies to have better infrastructure in these areas. Banks have to be directed to finance new business sectors such as electric vehicles, med-tech and IOT (Internet of things),” the chief minister’s office (CMO) said in a statement on Monday, attributing it to Bommai.The chief minister said Karnataka continued to attract higher foreign direct investment inflow in 2020 despite the Covid-19 pandemic. He said that the state amended key labour and land laws to attract more investments.“The state contributes immensely to the economy of the country, the state’s largest research and development sector and expert human resources are the main contributors to the state’s inflow of investment,” the chief minister said.He added that the Global Investor Meet, a biennial event that was last held in 2016, would be held next year.The state is also trying to get investors to look beyond Bengaluru, the state’s economic and power capital, which continues to be the go-to destination for most businesses coming into Karnataka.“Bidar and Kalaburagi airports in the state are operational and Shimoga, Raichur, Vijayapura and Karwar airports are expected to be operational by 2022,” Bommai said.Karnataka is aggressively pursuing investors as it tries to make up for the reduction in the state’s share in goods and services tax as well as the devolution of taxes under the 15th Finance Commission.Bommai said that speedy resolution of disputes outside of courts as well as relaxing coastal regulation zones is likely to help the state’s growth trajectory.He said that a portion of the District Mining Fund should be handed over to the state government.“This will help to repair the damage to other districts’ infrastructure by transporting the ore,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-seeks-centre-s-aid-to-keep-up-growth-101637003603469.html
16-11-2021||India||Aides tried to abduct Sriki for not delivering bitcoins: Police||Associates of Srikrishna, the person at the centre of Karnataka’s cryptocurrency scandal, had tried to abduct the hacker as he had failed to deliver Bitcoins in return for the former bankrolling his lavish lifestyle, details from the charge sheet reveal.The hacker has become the main person of interest in a raging Bitcoin scandal in Karnataka that has engulfed the entire political class with the police trying to unearth the purported scam and its magnitude.According to the statements in charge sheet against Srikrishna, his associates Suneesh Hegde, Prasidh Shetty and Robin Khandelwal have claimed that the former used to make them pay for his lavish lifestyle, promising them Bitcoins. When he didn’t keep his promise, they even tried to abduct him.In other instances, too Srikrishna had made his associates pay for his luxurious life promising them Bitcoins.“He claimed to have hacked and stolen several bitcoins and promised to give them to me. So, I looked after all expenses of SriKi. Till now, I have spent over ₹2 crore on him,” read Suneesh’s statement.Details of this conflict within the gang were shared by Khandelwal who was helping Srikrishna convert his Bitcoins to cash. Khandelwal, a B.Com graduate from Kolkata had started his career running his father’s rice mill. Later he learnt about Bitcoins and started operating a cryptocurrency exchange.According to the chargesheet, Robin first came in touch with Sriki in 2017, when the hacker contacted him to convert Bitcoins. Initially, Srikrishna introduced himself under a ‘Dariel Herman’ and asked Khandelwal to sell 900 bitcoins.After this first transaction, Srikrishna remained in constant touch with Khandelwal and in 2018, the two met for the first time in Bengaluru. During this meeting Srikrishna revealed his real identity. He told Khandelwal that he was a hacker and he could provide many Bitcoins for conversion.Srikrishna would transfer Bitcoins he acquired after hacking to Robin who would then convert the Bitcoins into cash, keep his commission and then transfer the money to various accounts. According to the charge sheet, Khandelwal said that Sriki sent him 130 Bitcoins from 2017 till December 20, 2020. Robin sold them and, after taking his commission, transferred Rs. 3.48 crores to multiple accounts Sriki had given him.It was during this trip to Bengaluru that Khandelwal was introduced to the other accused in the case, namely Suneesh Hedge, Prasidh Shetty and Sujay Raj by Srikrishna.These three men were Srikrishna’s associates in the hacking into poker websites. Explaining their modus operandi, the chargesheet reads that Poker sites were hacked by Srikrishna when his friends played the poker games online. After hacking into the website, Srikrishna would give them details of the opponent’s cards and they would win the game and the cash prize that came with it.For these hacking sessions, Srikrishna insisted on staying in five-star hotels in Goa, which later became the root of conflict within the gang. Srikrishna made Suneesh foot the bill for these expensive stays and according to the charge sheet they stayed in Goa for 10 days.When Srikrishna began ignoring their calls the trio hatched a plot against the hacker. Robin in his statement claimed that he put a fake bandage on his leg to scare Srikrishna that he was beaten up by the gang, forcing him to flee the hotel he was staying in.Later they asked Khandelwal to bring Srikrishna to a safe house in Bidadi, in the outskirts of Bengaluru, on the pretext that he was taking him to a safe house. Here the gang locked up and threatened the hacker to pay their share of bitcoins.Khandelwal in his statement claimed that while locked up in the apartment, Srikrishna convinced him that they should escape from the balcony and they should keep the Bitcoins for themselves. Convinced by his plan, Srikrishna escaped from the apartment with the help of Khandelwal, reads his statement.Months later Suneesh is arrested in a drug case and during the interrogation, he reveals that it was Srikrishna who purchased the drugs for him. Following this Srikrishna is arrested on November 17.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aides-tried-to-abduct-sriki-for-not-delivering-bitcoins-police-101637003484580.html
16-11-2021||India||Aspirants begin lobbying for parties ahead of Karnataka legislative council elections||Prospective candidates for the upcoming elections to 25 seats in the upper house of the Karnataka legislature on December 10 continue to lobby within their own parties and look for possibilities in rival parties as the race for the polls heats up in the southern state.People aware of the developments said that leaders from all three major parties--Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Congress and the Janata Dal (Secular) or JDS(S)--continue to shop for better prospects within their own as well as rival parties to make the cut.Of those whose terms in the upper house end include BJP minister Kota Srinivas Poojary and Congress opposition leader SR Patil, among others.The last day for nominations is on November 23. On Sunday night, A Manju, who was formerly with the Congress and defected to the BJP before 2019, met opposition leader Siddaramaiah to find his way back to the party fold.“He (Manju) has been talking to us and is ready to join the Congress. We are still discussing if we should bring him back or not,” said one person directly aware of the developments, requesting not to be named.Manju had unsuccessfully contested on a BJP ticket against Prajwal Revanna of the JD(S) in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.Manju’s son Mantar Gowda too has been in touch with the Congress which Siddaramaiah denied.“Let the people of Kodagu decide who they want as a candidate,” Siddaramaiah said, refusing to divulge more information about any meeting with the BJP leader.The developments come even as the BJP, Congress and JD(S) are trying to prepare the ground for the upcoming zilla and taluka panchyat, Bengaluru corporation and the 2023 assembly elections.The BJP believes that gaining a majority in the upper house can help with easy passage of contentious bills over the course of the next one and a half years before elections. It has so far relied on the JD(S) to either support it or refrain from voting to ensure the passage of bills.The BJP has 32, the Congress has 29 and the JD(S) has 12 seats in the upper house.There are several more examples of leaders wanting to jump ship which the JD(S) claims was “decided two years ago”.“We are aware of those who want to leave our party and it was decided over two years ago,” TA Sharavana, a JD(S) leader said.Of those who are expected to leave the JD(S) include GT Deve Gowda, Srinivas Gowda, Gubbi Srinivas and Manohar among others.Most of the interest of leaders from the old Mysuru region appears to head to the Congress while several more are looking at the BJP, according to multiple people aware of the developments.BJP’s Ravi Kumar said that the party is discussing the candidatures but that nothing has been decided yet.The BJP is expected to start its Janaswaraj Yatra from November 17 with four senior leaders heading teams across the state to finalise the candidates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aspirants-begin-lobbying-for-parties-ahead-of-karnataka-legislative-council-elections-101637003003548.html

Immediately after the New Year, our specialists will arrive in India for the equipment transfer at the sites where it will be stationed,” he said.Mikheyev said Indian specialists who will operate the first regiment of S-400 systems have completed their training in Russia and returned home. The deliveries of the S-400 systems are being carried out in compliance with the terms of the contract with India, he added.India announced its intention to purchase S-400 air systems in 2015. A $5.4-billion contract for five regiments of S-400 systems was signed during Russian President Vladimir Putin’s visit to India for an annual summit in October 2018.People familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity that Russia started shipping the components for the first batch of S-400 systems by air and sea. India has signalled its intention to go ahead with the deal despite the US warning it could attract secondary sanctions under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA). Putin is expected to visit India in the second week of December for the annual summit, which will set the stage for the two countries to renew their military-technical cooperation for the next decade.The S-400 Triumf is Russia’s latest long-and medium-range surface-to-air missile defence system that went into service in 2007. It is designed to destroy strategic and tactical aircraft, cruise and ballistic missiles and hypersonic weapons and can also be used against ground installations.The S-400 can engage targets at a distance of up to 400km and at an altitude of up to 30km.Mikheyev also said Rosoboronexport is in talks with seven of Russia’s strategic partners on possible supplies of the S-400 systems. “During the talks, we discuss the scope of supply, equipment, [and] offer additional means to boost the systems’ effectiveness and reliability,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/russia-starts-shipping-s-400-air-defence-system-to-india-ahead-of-sked-official-101637002885840.html

It also stated that the functioning of four educational institutions run by the department would be subject to the result of a PIL against this move, and sought a report from HR & CE in three weeks. “It must be appreciated that however pious the intention may be to use perceived surplus funds for the purpose of education, these funds are out of offerings for a particular cause and, ordinarily, the cause must not be forgotten, and the same must be espoused with a part of the funds, even though the larger sphere of education may also be addressed,” the court said in its orders.Chief justice Sanjib Banerjee and justice P D Adikesavalu issued the interim orders while hearing the PIL filed by T R Ramesh, who petitioned that funds of the temples should be used for the restoration and renovation of the temples and that decisions on financial matters can be taken only by the trustees of the temples.The judges said that apart from the four colleges that are ready to open for admissions at Kolathur (chief minister M K Stalin’s constituency) in Chennai, Tiruchengode Taluk in Namakkal, Ottanchathiram in Dindigul and at Vilathikulam in Thoothukudi, no steps should be taken to set up other proposed colleges. “In other words, educational institutions on the basis of Section 36 of the Act (Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act, 1959) or Section 66 thereof or even Section 97 thereof should not be instituted at this stage till trustees at the relevant temples are first put in place and the leave of this court is obtained in such regard.”The DMK, which formed the government in Tamil Nadu in May, had on October 6 passed a government order from the higher education department to open these colleges using temple funds. Advocate General R Shanmugasundaram informed the court that funds from the ‘common good fund’ are being utilised for this purpose.The court directed the HR & CE department to introduce a new subject on Hindu religion in the four colleges under the department that have already started functioning. The court noted that in the four colleges BBA, B Com and other similar courses have been offered without any regular course in religious instructions in the Hindu religion. “It will be a condition precedent to the four colleges opening that a stream of religious instructions in Hindu religion is introduced. If such a course is not introduced within a month of the college starting, the further functioning of the college cannot continue,” the court said.The matter has been posted for December 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madras-hc-asks-hr-ce-dept-to-set-up-no-new-institutes-in-tamil-nadu-101637002883537.html
16-11-2021||India||Vanniyar Sangam issues legal notice to Jai Bhim makers||The Vanniyar Sangam, the parent body of the caste-based party Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK), has issued a legal notice to the makers of Tamil movie Jai Bhim and OTT platform Amazon Prime to remove certain scenes where the organisation’s symbol is present, which they say portray their community in poor light. PMK is part of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in Tamil Nadu. The notice on Monday sought damages in ₹5 crore within seven days from the time of receipt of the notice. On behalf of T Arulmozhi, the Vanniyar Sangam state president, PMK’s spokesperson and advocate K Balu has issued the legal notice to the team including S Suriya and TJ Gnanavel, the lead actor and director of Jai Bhim , Suriya’s wife Jyothika and the couple’s production house 2D Entertainment Private Limited and a representative of Amazon Prime demanding they issue an unconditional apology. The legal notice also asked those behind the film to “cease and desist from making or publishing any false, malicious and defamatory remarks against (the Vanniyar) community and its people.” Jai Bhim is a real life story of a tribal man who was falsely implicated in a case and died in custody due to police torture in 1993 and the film shows how his wife and retired high court justice K Chandru fight for his justice. The case Rajakannu Versus State of Tamil Nadu and others resulted in three policemen being sentenced to 14 years rigorous imprisonment for the murder of Rajakannu. The notice stated that the movie has retained the real names of all the characters. “But deliberately you have changed the name of the sub inspector of police, who had tortured the victim in the police custody,” the notice stated. They alleged that the real name of the sub-inspector is Anthonysamy but the movie “deliberately” named him as Gurumurthy and “repeatedly referred to him as Guru” which they said was related to the community’s prominent late leader J Guru. The notice also pointed out that the symbol Agni Gundam (meaning raging flame from the holy pot) has been a sacred symbol of the Vanniyar community for many centuries which has been used in the movie in reference to the sub-inspector. “In one of the 4 sequence in the movie, you have shown the symbol of Vanniyar Sangam in the calendar behind the Sub Inspector of Police who commits the atrocity of torture in the movie,” they said. “You have deliberately got printed a calendar of the year 1995 with the symbol of “Agni Kundam’’ representing the Vanniyar Sangam and community with a malafide intention of defaming the members of Vanniyar sangam and damaging the image and reputation of entire vanniyar community.” The notice added that the makers have done this “wantonly, wilfully and intentionally”. They added that it cannot be considered as a “casual, innocent, inadvertent mistake” in the movie which has now been viewed by millions of cine lovers across the globe which was released on November 2 on the OTT platform. “You have projected the said wicked person, a wrongdoer, as if he belonged to Vanniyar community thereby imputing that the members of the Vanniyar community are prone to commit wrong and illegal things while in real life the said Sub Inspector does not belong to Vanniyar Community.” The notice said that the community has supported welfare of those marginalised and the film has caused communal disharmony. They noted that if the makers failed to comply, the Vanniyar Sangam would initiate criminal proceedings under section 499, 500 and 505 of the Indian Penal Code and suitable civil proceedings for claiming damages. Earlier this month, PMK leader and former union minister Anbumani Ramadoss wrote a letter to actor Suriya demanding answers. The actor had last week responded refuting the allegations. In his reply to Anbumani, Suriya said that he had no intention to insult anyone. “I hope you are aware that corrections were carried out as soon as some people pointed out mistakes,” he had said on November 12.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vanniyar-sangam-issues-legal-notice-to-jai-bhim-makers-101637002827136.html
16-11-2021||India||HC rejects plea claiming Nambi influenced CBI in Isro spy case probe||The Kerala high court on Monday dismissed a plea of a former police officer who accused former Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) scientist Nambi Narayanan of influencing a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)-led probe into the 1994 espionage case against him.Former Kerala Police officer S Vijayan is among 17 accused facing a probe by the central agency for falsely implicating Narayanan in the spy case. In his plea before the high court in July this year, the former police officer alleged that Narayanan had influenced the CBI probe by entering into land deals worth crores with the then investigating officials of the agency.Attaching records of some properties in Tirunelveli district of Tamil Nadu, Vijayan alleged that Narayanan and his son owned large tracts of land which they later handed over to the CBI officials to weaken the case against him. He added that the materials he had were sufficient for the trial court to order a probe and book the former Isro scientist and CBI officials under the Prevention of Corruption Act.The single bench of justice Narayana Pisharadi, however, told the petitioner that mere encumbrance certificates were not enough, and sale deeds and other records were required to prove the charges. The court subsequently quashed the plea with a suggestion that the former police officer move the trial court after furnishing sufficient documents.Reacting to the developments, Narayanan said “truth will always succeed”.Narayanan was wrongly accused of selling vital secrets associated with Indian space technology to Pakistan in 1994. Though he was later acquitted by a CBI court and the Supreme Court in 1998, he spent a total of 50 days in jail along with fellow scientist D Sasikumar and four others. In 2018, he was compensated ₹50 lakh by the Supreme Court for “unnecessary arrest, harassment and mental cruelty”.Vijayan was not available for a comment on the high court’s decision.Vijayan’s plea before the high court in July came after the CBI filed a conspiracy case against him and 16 others, for framing the former Isro scientist. All of them were booked under various offences, including criminal conspiracy, kidnapping and fabrication of evidence in connection with the arrest and detention of Narayanan in the espionage case. Besides Narayanan, two Maldivian women were also arrested and detained in the case. The two women were jailed for over three years before being released.Two months ago, the former police officer along with six others were granted bail by the high court in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-rejects-plea-claiming-nambi-influenced-cbi-in-isro-spy-case-probe-101637002824718.html
16-11-2021||India||IMD issues fresh alert in Kerala, two more dead||The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) on Monday issued a fresh alert in Kerala saying the heavy rains will continue for two more days. The IMD also issued an orange alert in Ernakulam, Idukki, Thrissur, Kozhikode, Kannur and Kasaragod, and a yellow alert in the remaining eight districts as two more people died in Thiruvananthapuram and Thrissur on Monday after they were swept away in gushing water, revenue officials said. On Sunday, three, including two children died due to landslides. Nine migrant workers had a miraculous escape after a building collapsed in Kozhikode on Monday. Alert locals and officials removed the debris immediately and saved them. Pathanamthitta and Idukki are the worst affected districts, and the state has opened more than 300 relief camps. The State Disaster Management Authority informed that in the last 24 hours, Kollam, Kottayam, Thiruvananthapuram, Idukki and Thrissur were affected the most.In rainfall-related incidents across the state, one house was fully damaged while 28 were partially damaged, SDMA said, adding that three lives, including that of two toddlers, were lost in the last 24 hours.A cyclonic circulation lying over the south-eastern Arabian Sea is likely to trigger very heavy or heavy rainfall over the next two days in parts of Kerala, the IMD said.State agriculture minister P Prasad said the state lost agriculture worth ₹400 crores in the last month. “We will approach the Union government for help,” he said in Alapzuha. Damage to houses, roads and bridges will be at least three times higher this amount, said a senior revenue official. To add to the state’s mounting woes annual pilgrimage to hill temple Sabarimala also began on Monday. Though pilgrims’ numbers are restricted to 30,000 a day, damaged roads and bridges are a big worry, said officials. Pilgrims are also not allowed to take bath in the holy river Pambha. “We are monitoring the situation closely,” said the newly-elevated president of the Travancore Dewasom Board K Anandagopan. Meanwhile, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, who is also the MP from the Wayanad constituency, asked the party workers to help rain-affected people. “Our brothers and sisters in Kerala are braving heavy rains. I appeal to Congress workers in help in every possible way,” he tweeted. The state recorded the highest northeast monsoon, 833 mm rainfall, between October 1 and November 15. The previous record was 822.9 mm received in 2010 during the same period, IMD statistics show. The usual rainfall during the northeast monsoon in Kerala is 492 mm between October 1 and December 31, but the fall has already doubled, with one-and-a-half months to go for the relapse of the second monsoon spell. The unusual rains have left a trail of death and destruction in the state. In the second week of October, 42 people died in flash floods and landslides. All dams and water bodies in the state are swollen, and shutters of the Idukki dam were opened on Sunday.

16-11-2021||India||Telangana: Former collector quits post, joins ruling TRS||A senior IAS officer and collector of Siddipet district in Telangana resigned from service on Monday to join the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) party. P Venkat Rami Reddy made headlines earlier this year in June when he touched the feet of chief minister K Chandrashekar Rao (KCR) at the inauguration of the new collector’s complex in Siddipet.A 2003-batch officer, Reddy told reporters that he opted for voluntary retirement from service and was relieved from duties after chief secretary Somesh Kumar accepted his resignation with immediate effect.Reddy later told reporters that he would be joining the TRS after getting the green signal from the chief minister. He is being tipped for the state legislative council membership under local bodies’ quota, the nomination process for which would begin on Tuesday and the elections would be held on December 10.Reddy joined the government service as a Group-I officer in 1996 during the combined Andhra Pradesh regime and was conferred with an IAS cadre in 2003. “I had been in the government service for more than 25 years and worked in various capacities. Now, I am joining the TRS, and it is for the party to take a call on how to utilise my services,” he said.On Monday, Reddy also went to Pragati Bhavan, the camp office of the chief minister in Hyderabad and met KCR. “I am ready to accept whatever responsibility I will be entrusted with,” he said.Reddy said, “KCR was developing Telangana into a No. 1 state in the country, which the people would remember for the next 100 years.” “Entire nation is looking up to KCR’s leadership. I have taken a decision to follow his path and will work as per his directions,” he said.Despite being a bureaucrat, Reddy has never concealed his admiration for the TRS. He triggered a controversy by touching KCR’s feet on June 21 this year, after which the opposition parties demanded that he be sacked from service. Reddy defended his gesture saying there was nothing wrong in touching the feet of the chief minister, who is the head of the state.Recently, Reddy stoked yet another controversy by warning the seed dealers against selling paddy seeds to farmers during the Rabi season, since the government was discouraging paddy cultivation.A video of the IAS officer threatening the seed dealers that he would send them to jail if they sold even a single kilogram of paddy seeds went viral on social media. “I don’t care even if you get permission from the high court or Supreme Court. As long as I am the collector of the district, there is no question of selling paddy seeds,” he asserted. HT has verified the veracity of the video and found it to be legit.He, however, retracted his statement after getting a dressing down from the Telangana high court on November 2.Telangana PCC leader and former minister Mohammad Ali Shabbir said it was no surprise that Reddy had quit the IAS officer post to join the TRS, as the Congress had been saying right from the beginning that he was working as a TRS agent.He reminded that the Congress had already lodged a complaint with President Ram Nath Kovind seeking action against Reddy for touching the feet of the chief minister in public. “KCR is rewarding Reddy with MLC seat for the latter’s slavery. This will prompt many more IAS and IPS officers to shun political neutrality and act as TRS functionaries,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-former-collector-quits-post-joins-ruling-trs-101637002764526.html
16-11-2021||India||Clashes between YSRCP, TDP mar Kuppam municipal polls||The Kuppam municipal election in Andhra Pradesh witnessed more than 70 per cent turnout on Monday even as sporadic clashes broke out between the ruling YSRCP and TDP. The results will be declared on Wednesday.The polling percentage is expected to go up to 80 per cent with the state election commission declaring that all those who were still in the queue by the closing hours at 5 pm would be allowed to cast their vote.The Kuppam municipality, home turf of Telugu Desam Party (TDP) president and former Andhra chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu is strongly contested by the YS Jagan Mohan Redd-led YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) to continue their domination in elections across the state. On Monday, the TDP alleged that the YSRCP had indulged in largescale rigging and impersonation in the Kuppam municipal elections. “The YSRCP leaders and cadre, at the behest of chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, committed midnight murder of democracy with the support of the authorities and misuse of police forces,” Naidu said at a press conference in the afternoon.He said the people of Kuppam put up strong resistance by coming out in large numbers to oppose the election excesses of the YSRCP leaders. “They caught hundreds of bogus voters and handed them over to the authorities. It was a black spot to democracy that the police did not act against bogus voters but resorted to lathi-charge on the people who came to stop impersonators,” he said.Naidu criticised the police for arresting TDP polling agents in several polling stations. “The police remained mute spectators when the YSRCP activists were blatantly bringing impersonators to the polling stations and arrested the TDP cadre who exposed them,” he alleged.Senior YSRCP leader and advisor to the state government on public affairs, Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy, described the allegations made by the TDP president as baseless. “Unlike in the past, our government has given a free hand to the IAS and IPS officers to discharge their duty. Naidu should stop making statements that demoralised the bureaucrats,” he said.Stating that it was time for Naidu to relinquish politics as he was not able to tolerate new-age politics, Reddy said the TDP chief was only trying to find excuses for his impending defeat in Kuppam. “The people have already given their mandate in favour of Jagan Mohan Reddy. If Naidu can’t realise this fact, it only reflects his defeatist mentality,” the YSRCP leader said.The YSRCP has heavily campaigned for the Kuppam municipal elections, as it has been the personal fiefdom of Naidu, who has been representing the constituency for the last seven terms since 1989.Though Naidu won the Kuppam assembly seat in the 2019 assembly polls, his party has been losing all the local body elections in his constituency since then. The TDP could win only three out of 65 Mandal Parishad (block Parishad) territorial constituencies (MPTCs) and lost all the four Zilla Parishad territorial constituencies (ZPTCs) to the ruling YSR Congress party in the elections held in April, results of which were declared on September 19.In the gram panchayat elections held in February this year, too, YSRC had won 75 out of 89 gram panchayats and the TDP had to remain content with just 14 gram panchayats.A defeat in the Kuppam municipal elections would be a major morale blow to Naidu ahead of the assembly elections scheduled in 2024.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/clashes-between-ysrcp-tdp-mar-kuppam-municipal-polls-101637002763500.html
16-11-2021||India||Row over 3 Andhra capitals: As trial resumes, govt seeks judges’ recusal||The Andhra Pradesh high court on Monday started fresh proceedings into the case against the proposed formation of three capitals for the state by the YS Jagan Mohan Reddy government, which was challenged by the farmers of Amaravati, the present capital region. A division bench of the high court, comprising chief justice Prashant Kumar Mishra and justices M Satyanaryana Murthy and D V S S Somayajulu, began the hearing of arguments in the case, which was postponed several times for various reasons, including the Covid-19 pandemic and transfer of the chief justices and judges. In June 2020, the Jagan Mohan Reddy government enacted two separate laws, the Andhra Pradesh Capital Region Development (Repeal) Act aimed at abolishing the authority created by the previous TDP government in 2015 to develop Amaravati as the state capital and the AP Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of All Regions Act aimed at establishing three capitals for the state – executive capital at Visakhapatnam, judicial capital at Kurnool and legislative capital at Amaravati. Thousands of farmers, who gave up over 34,000 acres of fertile land for setting up the state capital in Amaravati, challenged the two laws in the high court. More than 100 petitions were filed by the farmers in this regard. Arguing on behalf of Amaravati Parirakshana Samithi (Amaravati protection committee), senior Supreme Court advocate Shyam Divan argued that the governance was a continuous process and the change of governments did not mean a reversal of all the decisions taken by the previous regime. He said thousands of Amaravati farmers had given away their arable lands for the construction of the capital city of Andhra Pradesh under a land pooling scheme. Now, there were no sustainable means of livelihood for them, as they had lost the value of their plots given to them in place of the lands they had surrendered for the capital city due to the abrupt halting of development in the region. Appearing for the state government, senior advocate Dushyant Dave requested that two judges of the bench – justice Satyanarayana Murthy and justice Somayajulu – be recused of the hearing of the case, as there were allegations that both the judges had been allotted plots in Amaravati. The chief justice, however, rejected the plea stating that an earlier division bench had turned down the request but it was not challenged then. He, however, said he would examine the plea for recusal of the two judges at the time of giving the final judgment. Stating that there was a lot of significance to the hearing on the capital city issues, the chief justice observed that because of this case, the entire development in the state had come to a standstill. He assured that the hearing of the arguments would be completed at the earliest. The hearing of the petitions was first taken up in November last year by a division bench headed by former chief justice J K Maheshwari. The hearings ended abruptly with the transfer of Justice Maheshwari to Sikkim in March this year. His incumbent chief justice A K Goswami took up the hearing afresh in May but deferred it due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In August, the bench began the hearing but postponed it to November 15, on the petitioners’ plea. In the meantime, Justice Goswami was also transferred and replaced by Justice Mishra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/row-over-3-andhra-capitals-as-trial-resumes-govt-seeks-judges-recusal-101637002704967.html
16-11-2021||India||Bitcoin case: Siddaramaiah asks Karnataka government to provide protection to Sriki||Former Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah on Monday asked the Basavaraj Bommai-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government to provide protection to Srikrishna or Sriki, the person at the heart of the raging Bitcoin scandal, stating that the latter’s life could be in danger.“I urge @CMofKarnataka to ensure adequate protection to #Bitcoin scam kingpin Sri Krishna alias Sriki. Many influential people are said to be involved in the scam & hence protecting him becomes necessary,” Siddaramaiah said in a series of posts on Twitter.He added that it has become very important to keep Sriki safe to unravel the truth about the scandal which reportedly runs into several thousand crores.“Bitcoin scam is an organised ‘White collar crime’. It is said that all the passwords of the Bitcoin accounts related to the scam are just in the memory of Sriki. It is not written anywhere. His life will be under risk for these known & several unknown reasons,” Siddaramaiah posted.The statements come even as the scandal continues to take twists and turns ever since it was made public by Siddaramaiah earlier this month. The ruling BJP government under Bommai has tried to put the blame back on the Congress.Bommai has defended the government’s actions in trying to probe the scandal.Bommai on Monday said that the Congress is trying to “keep the non-issue alive”.“I have repeatedly said, if they have any documentary evidence let them give it to ED or state police. We will investigate it seriously.”R Ashoka, Karnataka’s revenue minister, on Monday said that the Congress is “intellectually bankrupt”.“During the previous elections, Congress tried to create a controversy related to (the) Rafale scam only to realise that the grand old party leaders were involved in it. Now, they are trying to rake up the Bitcoin issue. I wonder why Congress has turned out to be an expert in fake news. Every Congress leader seems to be an expert in lying without giving facts. The Congress party leaders have been making statements on releasing the documents related to Bitcoin and I wonder why they are not producing anything so far,” he said.The minister sought to know more details from the Congress who he said were claiming that the scandal had amounted to losses to several people.“I want to question the Congress party to give us details related to Bitcoin as to which company has lost money due to this. Where has the money been transferred? Let them provide proof. As Mr Basavaraj Bommai was weeding out the drug mafia, Congress party leaders are scared that their names will come out and hence they are trying to create the fake Bitcoin scandal. The main accused Sikri is a drug addict and a drug peddler. I question the Congress party as to why there was no proper investigation when it was in power. Now, the Congress party is worried that their leaders’ nexus will come out. I feel that the Congress is also worried over the Nalapad (referring to Congress legislator NA Harris’s son, Mohammed Nalapad) in the whole issue,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/siddaramaiah-seeks-protection-for-sriki-says-his-life-could-be-in-danger-over-bitcoin-scandal-101637002583481.html

16-11-2021||India||Centre says DPR on key river basin projects only after allocation of water: Bommai||Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Monday said the Centre has instructed the water resources ministry to decide on allocation of water of important rivers among southern states.In a statement, the chief minister’s office (CMO) said the Centre has instructed that detailed project reports (DPR) on various projects across river basins be decided only after water sharing has been finalised.“Union Home Minister Amit Shah has instructed the Union Water Resources ministry to decide on the allocation of water share of the respective basin states before preparing the Detailed Project Report (DPR) for Godavari, Krishna, Cauvery and Palar river linking project,” the CMO said in the statement, attributing it to Bommai.The statements come a day after Bommai objected to several projects in neighbouring states on river basins even before water sharing was decided at the 29th Southern Zonal Council meeting chaired by Shah in Tirupati, about 250 kms from Bengaluru.Andhra Pradesh CM Jaganmohan Reddy, Lakshadweep Administrator Praful Patel, Puducherry Lieutenant Governor Dr. Tamilisai Sounderajan, Puducherry chief minister N Rangaswamy participated in the meeting.“Union Home minister who chaired the meeting issued instructions to the Union Water Resources ministry on issued instructions, especially on projects related to river linking projects. Shah instructed the Water Resources ministry officials to consider Karnataka’s forceful stand to decide on the share of waters of the states before proceeding to prepare the DPR,” Bommai said on Monday.The chief minister also urged the government to take appropriate measures to issue the gazette notification on Krishna Water Tribunal-2 award. “I made a strong presentation on the irrigation projects of the state at the meet,” he said.The statements come at a time when Karnataka has been fighting long-winding legal battles with almost all its neighbouring states over river water sharing.In his speech at the council meeting on Sunday, Bommai had said that it had conveyed its stand on river linking projects in Godavari, Cauvery and other river basins to the union government.Karnataka urged the Centre not to approve the Cauvery-Vaigai-Gundar link works, initiated by Tamil Nadu. He also said that neighbouring Telangana had no right to take up Palamaru Ranga Reddy and Nakkalagandi lift irrigation projects from Srisailam reservoir in Krishna basin to draw huge quantities of surplus waters.He also opposed construction of Rajiv Gandhi Sangam Banda barrage by Telangana that proposes to draw surplus waters which he said would deprive Karnataka of its rightful share of water.Incidentally, Karnataka has been pushing to get necessary approvals to start work on the Mekedatu project which has been opposed by Tamil Nadu.“The Mekedatu project too was raised, but it could not be taken up for discussion as Tamil Nadu Chief Minister did not attend the meeting. (The) Union Water Resources minister would be urged to remove the obstacles for implementation of the Mekedatu project,” according to the CMO statement.Bommai said Tamil Nadu has been indulging in politics over river water sharing.“The neighboring state has been raising objections even after (the) Cauvery Tribunal pronounced its award. We too have submitted our objections against Tamil Nadu’s stand. These issues should be resolved judicially,” he added.Bommai said several issues were resolved at the meeting which included discussing land for Metro rail project, initiating measures to avoid use of anti--biotics in fishing, quick disposal of Pocso cases, filing of charge sheets in a timely manner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-says-dpr-on-key-river-basin-projects-only-after-allocation-of-water-bommai-101637002223381.html

We cannot afford to miss this opportunity and our higher educational institutions must equip our youth with 21st-century skills,” he said. He referred to emerging areas such as 5G technologies, artificial intelligence, robotics and biotechnology.“I would urge our private institutions and universities to make the best use of this opportunity and to work towards making India self-reliant and technologically advanced in the space sector,” Naidu said, according to a statement by the Press Information Bureau on Monday. He said that India, with its traditional strengths in innovation, IT and frugal engineering, has the potential of becoming a global drone hub. “Indian authors can better contextualize the engineering course content with regard to Indian socio-economic conditions,” he said He also called for more research on issues of priority like climate change. “We frequently read news reports about increasing pollution in Indian cities; I would urge our educational institutions to come up with technological solutions to such pressing problems faced by society, especially in agriculture,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cant-afford-to-miss-4th-industrial-revolution-venkaiah-naidu-101637002103976.html

16-11-2021||India||120kg heroin worth ₹600 crore seized in Gujarat, 3 arrested: Police||The Gujarat Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) has seized 120 kg of heroin, valued at ₹600 crore in global market, from the state’s Morbi district and arrested three persons in this connection, police officials said on Monday.The drug consignment was sent to the accused persons by their Pakistani counterpart at the Arabian Sea near the Indo-Pakistan international maritime boundary line, and was to be delivered to an African country, they said.It was initially kept hidden in a coastal area near Salaya in Gujarat’s Devbhumi Dwarka district before being moved to Morbi’s Zinzuda village from where it was seized on Sunday, state Director General of Police Ashish Bhatia told reporters.“Acting on an intelligence input on Sunday, the Gujarat ATS raided an under-construction house in the village and recovered 120 kg of heroin worth ₹600 crore in the international market. Three persons were arrested in this connection,” the DGP said.The consignment was sent by one Zahid Bashir Baloch, a resident of Pakistan who is a wanted absconder in the earlier seizure of 227 kg heroin by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) in 2019, he said.It was intended to be transported to an African country, the senior police official said.The heroin was delivered to the apprehended accused, identified as Mukhtar Hussein and Samsuddin Hussainmiyan Saiyyed, at the sea in the last week of October at the given coordination shared by Baloch with Mukhtar Hussein’s brother Isa Rav, he said.The conspiracy for the contraband delivery was hatched in the United Arab Emirates, like in most cases in the past, the official said. The drug consignment was to be handed over to the Indian smugglers to be transported to an African country, in accordance with the normal modus operandi of narcotic smugglers from Pakistan and Iran to use Indian counterparts for transporting drugs to the conduit, he said.“In the present case, the accused persons, apprehended by the Gujarat ATS, decided to divert the consignment, intended for Africa, to India and misappropriate it and sell it to various buyers,” he said. The under-construction house from where the drug consignment was seized belonged to a third accused person, identified as Gulam Hussein Umar Bhagad, he said.“Smugglers opt for the Indian route because it is cheap, short distance, and they can easily hide their illegal activities because detection is not easy among around 25,000 fishing boats plying in the area,” he said. Bhatia said the Gujarat coast is being used as a transit point to transport drugs being sent along the Indo-Pak international boundary line by Pakistani and Iranian heroin smugglers.“However, the Gujarat Police have been successful in neutralising all such attempts and all the consignments sent by these cartels have been successfully seized and the accused persons arrested,” he said.Minister of State for Home Harsh Sanghavi lauded the Gujarat Police for their efforts to tackle the drug menace.“Another achievement of Gujarat Police. Gujarat Police is leading from the front to eliminate the drugs. Gujarat ATS has nabbed around 120 kilo drugs,” he tweeted in the morning.The ATS in a release said the interrogation and investigation in such cases have revealed that “various geopolitical reasons are responsible for this surge in the number of attempts being made through Gujarat coast.” Last week, the state police had seized heroin and methamphetamine drugs worth ₹313.25 crore from three persons in Devbhumi Dwarka district.Earlier, in the single largest heroin haul in India in September, authorities seized around 3,000 kg of the drug, believed to be from Afghanistan and likely worth ₹21,000 crore in the global market, from two containers at the Mundra port in Gujarat’s Kutch district, officials earlier said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/120kg-heroin-worth-rs-600-crore-seized-in-gujarat-3-arrested-police-101637001864882.html
16-11-2021||India||Autopsy can be conducted after sunset||Post-mortem procedures can now be carried out at night, especially to enable the faster release of bodies to harvest organs for transplant surgeries, according to a new protocol issued by the Centre on Monday.As things stand, autopsies were performed before sunset, and only procedures that received special permission by the law enforcement agencies could be carried out at night. This, experts said, often led to organs of donors being unusable because the crucial hours in which they can be harvested and preserved were lost.“In response to the multiple references that have been received by the Union health ministry from various sources, and in line with the government’s commitment to promote ease of living by reducing burden imposed due to compliance to government processes, changes have been made in the post-mortem protocols to allow for the procedure to be conducted after sunset effective from today,” the health ministry said in a statement.“Apart from friends and relatives of the deceased, this new procedure also promotes organ donation and transplant as organs can be harvested in the stipulated time window after the procedure,” the statement added.The Directorate General of Health Services, the technical wing of Union health ministry, extensively examined several representations made to the ministry in this regard, and allowed institutes with adequate infrastructure to perform the procedure at night, officials said.“It was ascertained that some institutes are already performing night-time post-mortem. In view of the rapid advancement and improvement in technology, especially availability of required lighting and infrastructure required for post-mortem, performing night time post-mortem in hospitals is now feasible,” the statement read.Union health Mansukh Mandaviya hailed it as a move aimed at saving lives.“British era arrangement ends! Post-mortem will be conducted round the clock. Taking forward PM Narendra Modi’s idea of good governance, Union health ministry decided that hospitals that have the facility to conduct post mortem at night will be allowed to perform post-mortem after sunset,” he tweeted.The protocol also said that the post-mortem procedures for organ donation must be taken up on priority, and all post-mortem procedures performed at night need to be videographed.However, cases under categories such as homicide, suicide, rape, decomposed bodies, and suspected foul play, should not be taken up for post-mortem procedures during the night unless there is a law-and-order situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/postmortem-can-now-be-conducted-after-sunset-101637001503373.html
16-11-2021||India||At Suvendu vs Mamata hearing, Supreme Court has ‘a million-dollar question’||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday had many questions for Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Suvendu Adhikari on his plea to transfer the election petition filed by West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee to any high court outside West Bengal on the ground that he will not get a fair hearing in the case.Mamata Banerjee, who lost to Adhikari from the Nandigram assembly segment in the state polls held early this year approached the Calcutta high court with an election petition questioning her rival’s victory by a thin margin of 1,965 votes. Adhikari, the leader of opposition in West Bengal, moved the top court demanding the petition to be shifted outside the state to allow him a “fair trial”.Senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani, appearing for Adhikari, said, “I cannot get a fair trial due to the events that have transpired outside the court of justice Kaushik Chanda who was first hearing the election petition. This amounts to subversion of justice.”Adhikari, in his petition filed through advocate Surjendu Sankar Das, said, “The respondent’s position as the chief minister does not take away from the fact that she either instigates anarchy by her supporters and party workers or she does not have control over such persons who perpetrate lawlessness and anarchy as has been witnessed even inside the Calcutta high court premises during the hearing of the recusal application by justice Kausik Chanda.”Jethmalani further pointed out that during the election process, Adhikari’s poll agents were attacked and there was an apprehension of a threat to the life and property of potential witnesses in the election petition.A single-judge bench of justice Hima Kohli wondered if this could be a valid reason to seek transfer of a case.“Can that be a ground to entertain a transfer petition when you haven’t made Election Commission a party? Casting aspersions on Election Commission in a suit where the there is a sole respondent (Mamata Banerjee) does not help you.” The poll panel was a party in the election petition filed by Banerjee.Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for the Bengal chief minister, said the petition is a vote of no confidence against the entire institution of Calcutta high court based on an order of recusal by justice Chanda. He was referring to justice Chanda’s order by which he refused to hear the matter after Banerjee claimed that as chief minister, she refused her consent to make justice Chanda a permanent judge of the high court.In his plea, Adhikari said he apprehended that the election petition “may not be fairly adjudicated in an unbiased manner” because Banerjee served as the chief minister of West Bengal since 2011, “and... therefore, a majority of the judges of the Calcutta high court would have either a favourable or unfavourable opinion of the respondent”.“Are you saying the entire high court is disqualified to hear this petition? It is a designated court to hear the election petition. Why should this matter go to any other high court is a million-dollar question,” justice Kohli asked Jethmalani.The judge also asked: “How do you define fair trial.”Jethmalani sought to explain how fair trial in a case can be vitiated on these apprehensions and relied on a Supreme Court judgment, the details of which were not conveyed in advance to the court.Jethmalani sought time to supply the copy of a judgment on this point and requested for a hearing on Tuesday. However, the bench posted it after two weeks. In July, justice Shampa Sarkar of the Calcutta high court issued notice on Banerjee’s election petition following recusal by justice Chanda. In August, when the matter was last heard, Adhikari got it adjourned on account of the transfer petition filed by him in the top court. The high court listed the petition for hearing later this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-suvendu-vs-mamata-hearing-supreme-court-has-a-million-dollar-question-101637001383307.html
16-11-2021||India||Delhi HC likely to get first openly gay judge||India may finally get its first openly gay person as a judge of a constitutional court.The Supreme Court collegium has recommended the elevation of senior advocate Saurabh Kirpal as a judge in the Delhi high court, rejecting the Union government’s preliminary objections against his proposed elevation.“The Supreme Court Collegium, in its meeting held on 11th November, 2021, has approved the proposal for elevation of Shri Saurabh Kirpal, advocate, as judge in the Delhi High Court,” read the collegium’s resolution uploaded on the top court’s website on Monday evening. The collegium, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana, picked Kirpal, 49, who was one of the leading lawyers in the landmark Navtej Singh Johar case that led to the Supreme Court decriminalising homosexuality in 2018.The collegium also includes justices Uday U Lalit, AM Khanwilkar, DY Chandrachud and L Nageswara Rao.Former attorney general and veteran lawyer Mukul Rohatgi said Kirpal’s elevation was long overdue, and that Monday was the day of real recognition of the Supreme Court’s judgment reading down Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code that criminalised homosexuality.“Kirpal is one of the brightest lawyers and I have had personal experience of his intellect and hard work. In Hindi, I will say ‘der aaye durust aaye’ (better late than never),” added Rohatgi.Kirpal was unavailable for comment.In October 2017, the Delhi high court unanimously recommended Kirpal for appointment as a judge of the Delhi HC. However, the Intelligence Bureau (IB), which was tasked with a background check on Kirpal, came out with an adverse report in 2018 and 2019, suggesting Kirpal’s partner, who is a foreign national, might pose a security risk.In view of the IB reports, the collegium kept deferring Kirpal’s elevation. The SC collegium deferred its decision on Kirpal’s recommendation on three occasions — in January 2019, April 2019 and in August last year.In March 2021, the then CJI SA Bobde wrote to the Union government, seeking additional information and more clarity on its reservations over Kirpal’s name. The government responded in April, reiterating its apprehensions against his partner. This time, the government pointed out that Kirpal’s partner was employed with the Swiss embassy and that he was working with a Switzerland-based non-profit organisation prior to this job.In March 2021, Kirpal was designated as a senior advocate by the Delhi high court after all 31 judges of the high court unanimously endorsed his designation.While the collegium, led by then CJI Bobde, could not take a final call on Kirpal’s elevation, justice Ramana and the four other most senior judges, after consulting the other judges in the top court, decided to send Kirpal’s name for appointment as a judge in the Delhi high court.Under the Memorandum of Procedure (MoP), if the collegium recommends a name for appointment as a judge, the Centre can return that name for a review. However, once the collegium reiterates that name, the government has no choice but to notify the name. At best, the government can delay his appointment but not turn it down.Kirpal studied law at Oxford University and Cambridge University, and has practised for over two decades. His father BN Kirpal was the Chief Justice of India for six months in 2002.In an interview to HT in September 2020, Kirpal acknowledged that his sexuality could be the reason behind the apex court collegium deferring a decision on appointing him as a judge and the government raising objections.“My professional competence was known to the high court and the Supreme Court collegium and my case for elevation was presumably not deferred for that reason. Media reports seemed to indicate the issue might have been the nationality of my partner who is Swiss. Had I been a straight man with a foreign spouse, this would not have been an issue; former Supreme Court judges have had foreign spouses. But it became an issue only because I am not,” Kirpal had told HT.Kirpal had said that his sexuality was the only stumbling block. “The aim was to have diversity on the bench. I really believe it could change the lives of so many LGBT [lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender] people in India.’’ Apart from Kirpal, the collegium also reiterated its proposals to appoint four lawyers -- Tara Vitasta Ganju, Anish Dayal, Amit Sharma and Mini Pushkarna -- as judges of the Delhi high court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-likely-to-get-first-openly-gay-judge-in-india-101637001203384.html

The deceased’s wife also sustained minor injuries due to the fall.Palakkad superintendent of police (SP) R Viswanadh said a special investigation team was formed to probe the case and that police have some information about the assailants.Police suspect that the accused fled to neighbouring Tamil Nadu after committing the crime, he added.The SP also said that the murder appeared to be an outcome of the ongoing tension between RSS and SDPI workers in the area.Condemning the incident, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) state chief K Surendran said: “Police are too soft towards SDPI goons who have been carrying out cold-blooded murders. If the culprits are not arrested immediately, the party will launch an agitation.”BJP president of Palakkad district, K M Haridas, described the incident as a “well-planned and executed political murder”.He added that Sanjith had escaped a similar attack in June last year but police did not take any action against the SDPI activists.Opposition leader VD Satheesan also condemned the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rss-worker-hacked-to-death-in-kerala-role-of-sdpi-suspected-police-101637000904581.html

The people are aware of the fact and they cannot be misled,” he claimed.The BJP dismissed the “lies”. “The manner in which Akhilesh Yadav is beating the drum of kagazi (on paper only) expressway, his next tweet will be that ‘Ram temple has also been built by the Samajwadi Party government.’ Take this credit also Akhilesh Ji...when you tell so many lies then one more lie can do…” it posted on its Twitter handle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-up-elections-pm-modi-to-inaugurate-purvanchal-expressway-today-101637000844518.html
16-11-2021||India||Jailed for theft in Ghaziabad, a budding politician from Sitamarhi||On October 26, there was much celebration in Gulshan Praveen’s two-storey house in the village of Jogia in Sitamarhi. In a hard fought district board election, Praveen polled 2,967 of a total of six thousand votes, beating her nearest rival Mohammad Jamrullah Khan. 1,200 kilometres away, in a jail cell in Dasna, Ghaziabad, there was likely a sense of cheer as well. The jail compound is where Praveen spent over a month just before the election, charged with being an accomplice to her husband, 32-year-old Mohammad Irfan, accused of theft and robbery in 40 cases across multiple states. Back in Jogia though, Irfan is a hero, a man who should have been the person fighting the elections, the Samaritan who spent money building a dilapidated road, held medical camps and gave money to the poor for surgeries. And it is his goodwill that has ensured that Praveen is now in a position of power.The riseIn Jogia, 26 kilometres north of the district headquarters, Praveen lives with her mother-in-law Nasima, and her two daughters, aged 7 and 10, in a home with a large iron gate and a cement arch, both its floors sporting a coat of fresh white paint. The house is on the banks of a river, two kilometres away from the main road. It was not always like this.Both Nasima, and her husband, who died in the year 2000, were daily-wage labourers. They grew up in a hut, and with four children and very little money, Irfan left home at the age of 10 and moved to Mumbai. “He worked in Mumbai at a trolley bag company. My elder son Mohammad Salman works as a labourer and the middle one, Gufran, also works in Mumbai in the same trolley bag company,” 68-year-old Nasima said.While details of his life in Mumbai are sketchy, senior Ghaziabad police officials said that Irfan came to Delhi in 2011 and tried to run a paan stall but was not successful. There were other enterprises, including a grocery shop and a ready-made garment shop in Bawana, but both those sank as well. “He then came across a thief , who trained him, and he began his life in crime,” a Ghaziabad police official said on condition of anonymity.Back home, Irfan’s life is local legend, and people believe he began stealing after his family was unable to give enough dowry for his sister’s wedding. His family declined to comment on this. Within years though, his riches began to grow, and in the middle of the decade came the home, and a fleet of vehicles. Irfan is illiterate, and can only sign his name, but he began using the pseudonym Aryan Khanna, with a profile named as such on Facebook, the owner of Khanna Industries. The company does not exist, police officials said.The crimes and the arrestA senior police officer said that the first time Irfan was arrested was by Delhi police in July 2017 from a hotel in Sitamarhi, accused of a burglary of ₹65 lakh from the home of a judicial officer in the Capital’s posh New Friends Colony. Within a year, Irfan was out on bail, and the spate of crimes refused to stop. In the next five years, the robberies that Irfan committed ranged from a burglary in a businessman’s home near the residence of the Goa governor, to a theft in the posh Gomti Nagar area in Lucknow in July. “Irfan has admitted that he has earned over ₹20 crore from burglaries in 40 homes across 12 states,” another police official said, asking not to be named. Initially, investigators said, Irfan worked completely alone, breaking in through a window, or a flimsy door. On his person, he would carry only a wire cutter, a modified screw driver, a sedative to tackle pet dogs, and would strike between 1am and 3am. Somewhere in the past decade, however, he began acquiring luxury second-hand vehicles, which would aid him in avoiding suspicion during reconnaissance, and commit crimes across states.“He told us during interrogation that one of his luxury cars was seized by police in Punjab’s Jalandhar. He said that he drove to Kerala in a BMW and also used an Audi during another theft in Hyderabad. He purchased the Audi for ₹17.5 lakh,” said Nipun Agarwal, SP City (Ghaziabad). Police have recovered a Jaguar and a brand new Mahindra Scorpio.His robberies across states needed at least one more accomplice who would help in driving long distances, and Irfan began using the help of Mohammad Imran, who he met while in prison in Delhi. “He also had at least four girlfriends in different parts of the country who helped in sheltering him immediately after he committed a crime. He would shower them with gifts, and they would help him lie low,” the senior police official cited above added.On September 4, ₹1.5 crore in gold and silver ornaments were stolen from the residence of businessman Kapil Garg, in the upscale “D Block” area of Ghaziabad’s Kavinagar. The home was a stone’s throw away from the residence of Atul Garg, UP state minister for medical and health, family welfare and mother and child welfare. Spurred into action, Ghaziabad police tracked a new Mahindra Scorpio that was seen near the scene of the crime in CCTV footage from the area. It was a vehicle Irfan purchased four days before the robbery.By September 7, Ghaziabad police raided Jogia and arrested three people: Irfan’s his wife Praveen, their driver Mohammad Soyab and another accomplice named Bikram Sao. “His wife Gulshan Praveen was brought to Ghaziabad after the cops found her in possession of the stolen jewellery items. There was a lot of resistance from local politicians as her arrest would jeopardise her election prospects. But we brought her on transit remand,” Agarwal said. By the end of September, Praveen was out on bail.Station house officer of the Kavinagar police station Abdul Rehman Siddiqui said that in all, 11 people, including one of Irfan’s girlfriends, were arrested before the police could get hold of the man himself. It was finally on October 26, the same day his wife won the election, that police traced and arrested Irfan outside the premises of the Ghaziabad lower court.Ghaziabad police said while most cases in which they have traced Irfan’s involvement revolve around theft and robbery — a case in Agra in 2015 is under provisions of the Gangster Act, and another from this year in Jalandhar, registered under the Arms Act. Sitamarhi SP Har Kishore Rai said there is no case registered against Irfan in Sitamarhi or the adjoining districts of Bihar.The Samaritan politicianGulshan Praveen told HT that immediately after her release from prison in the last week of September, she rushed to Sitamarhi and filed her nomination papers on October 6. Not that the stint affected her prospects. In the village, it is clear that Praveen being the candidate is the next best thing to Irfan, the prodigal son, who would have fought the election if he had not been in jail.Local social activist Jivesh Mishra said Irfan had done a great deal for the village over the past year, preparing for the elections. “He spent ₹1.05 crore on the construction of roads and drainage. He also spent ₹20 lakh for the cancer surgery of a neighbour who was undergoing treatment in a Delhi hospital,” he said.But it wasn’t just this one year, and with an eye on the election. For 55-year-old Rasmati, Irfan was the benefactor who paid ₹10,000 for an operation in 2019; 62-year-old Jogender Ram, a daily-wage earner, told HT that Irfan paid ₹4,000 during the wedding of his daughter in 2018, and ₹5,000 for a liver operation. Mohammad Modassar, former sarpanch of Godassar village, said, “He always helped the needy, held medical camps, and helped financially with marriages of the poor.”In the time he has been in the custody of Ghaziabad police, officials said Irfan has professed a love for cars, and shown an uncanny ability to tell the make, cut, and estimated value of precious jewellery. But what he has talked about incessantly, is his desire to enter politics, even fighting the next assembly elections.Agarwal said, “He also told us that he knows some senior politicians in Bihar and was trying his luck in getting a ticket. He also showed us some videos in which he was wearing a kurta pyjama and is dressed like a politician. He says if he is released from jail, he wants to study, and try his luck in the assembly election.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jailed-for-theft-in-ghaziabad-a-budding-politician-from-sitamarhi-101637000842765.html
16-11-2021||India||Will upgrade SIT for Lakhimpur case: UP||The Uttar Pradesh government on Monday told the Supreme Court that it has no objection to the appointment of a former high court judge to oversee the probe into the Lakhimpur Kheri incident so as to “infuse fairness, independence, and faith” into the investigation.“We have no objection to the court’s recommendation. Your lordships may make that order,” senior lawyer Harish Salve, appearing for the state government, submitted before a bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana as soon as the proceedings commenced in the case registered by the top court on its own motion (suo motu).Salve, however, requested the bench not to disqualify any retired judge from being considered just because they happen to be from Uttar Pradesh.“It is not that a judge from this state cannot be appointed. A judge is a judge after all,” Salve told the bench, which also included justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli.The bench replied that it was open to considering all names but would need a day to speak to the judge concerned before making the appointment. “We need one more day’s time because we are considering either Rakesh Jain (of Punjab and Haryana high court) or any other judge. But we need to talk to the concerned judge before we finalise,” it said.While fixing the matter to be heard next on Wednesday, the bench also asked Salve to consider inducting some high-ranking and senior police officers in the special investigation team (SIT), which has been investigating the incident.“You have to upgrade the SIT. There have to be more high-ranking officers. Most of them are inspector-level officers. Also, most of them are from Lakhimpur only. Why don’t you give us some names and we can then pass orders?” it said.Salve accepted the court’s suggestion, and said he would come back on Wednesday with a list of some senior police officers who could be inducted.Over the last few hearings, the top court has been critical of the manner in which the state police have so far conducted the investigation in the case where eight people died in that incident on October 3 -- four farmers, three Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers, and a journalist.On November 8, the bench pulled up the UP police, commenting that the investigation into the Lakhimpur Kheri incident appears to be favouring the “main accused” in the case.The remarks continued the trend of the top court’s dissatisfaction with the probe in the case where a convoy, in which at least one vehicle belonged to Union minister Ajay Mishra ‘Teni’, ran over farmers protesting three controversial laws, leading them to run amok and lynch some of the occupants of the vehicles.Ashish Mishra, the son of the minister, is one of the accused in one of the two cases (the convoy running over farmers) being investigated.His arrest came only after the bench, on October 9, criticised the lenient treatment he seemed to be receiving from the police in the murder FIR.The other case being investigated by the police relates to the lynching of some of the occupants of vehicles in the convoy. In the last hearing, the Supreme Court was perturbed that some of the evidence being collected in this case was aimed at protecting the “main accused”The state maintained that it has “clinching evidence” of Mishra’s presence at the scene (something he and his father have consistently denied), but that forensic reports on this are awaited.The bench had then underscored the need for appointing a retired high court judge from outside the state to monitor the probe after noticing that the investigation in the farmers’ murder case (FIR no. 219) could be adversely impacted by the manner in which the Uttar Pradesh police were recording evidence in the case relating to the murder of three BJP workers (FIR no. 220).It added that the court does not have confidence in the judicial commission appointed by the UP government.On October 7, the UP government set up a judicial commission, headed by retired Allahabad high court judge, justice PK Srivastava, to probe the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-upgrade-sit-for-lakhimpur-case-up-101637000724535.html
16-11-2021||India||PM CARES relief should reach children soon: SC||The Supreme Court on Monday gave the central and state governments two weeks to report the status of relief granted to children orphaned due to Covid-19 under the PM CARES for Children Scheme after being told that the district magistrates concerned have received 4,148 applications and approved 1,719 requests for coverage under the scheme.“We want to see benefits reach the children. Till now we are just groping in the dark,” the bench of justices L Nageswara Rao and BR Gavai said, directing the Centre to file an affidavit providing details of steps taken under the scheme and the information on the educational status of these children. The bench also ordered the district magistrates and collectors to ascertain the educational status of all children who are eligible for benefits under the PM CARES scheme.The top court’s direction came on a follow-up hearing on a suo moto (of its own accord) petition where the court is considering relief for children who were in need of care and protection on account of Covid-19. The court will take up the case next on December 13.Lawyer Gaurav Agrawal, who is assisting the court as amicus curiae (literally, a friend of the court) complained that no information was available about the children who benefitted from the scheme though it was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 29 May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/benefits-under-pm-cares-should-reach-children-orphaned-by-covid-soon-sc-101637000544815.html
16-11-2021||India||Centre tweaks rules to cement ED, CBI chiefs’ extended tenure||The Union government on Monday amended its Fundamental Rules (FR) to bring them in line with two ordinances promulgated on Sunday to give the chiefs of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) extended terms of up to five years.The overarching set of rules listed in the government’s FR apply to all civilian officers, and cover the entire gamut of their in-service and post-retirement work scenarios, making it possible for the government to ensure continuity over much of its remaining term.According to the notification issued on Monday, the rules now allow the central government to give extension in “public interest” to the defence secretary, home secretary, director of Intelligence Bureau (IB), Secretary of Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) and directors of Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Enforcement Directorate (ED), on a case-to-case basis, subject to the condition that the total term of such secretaries or directors does not exceed two years or the period provided in the respective act or rules made thereunder, under which their appointments are made”.To be sure, the existing FR already provided for a maximum two-year extension to the home, foreign and defence secretaries, and the CBI, R&AW and IB chiefs.Under the newly promulgated ordinances, CBI and ED chiefs are eligible for a maximum of five-year total tenures, and the changes to the FR take that into account.The notification issued on Monday, however, excluded the post of foreign secretary from the ambit of the exceptions to the superannuation rules, which otherwise say that all officers must retire at the age of 60. It was not clear at the time of going to print why this change was effected.The post of foreign secretary was included in the Fundamental Rules following a proposal cleared by the Union Cabinet in December 2010 “in view of the assignment of Foreign Secretary having increasingly acquired critical dimensions from the national security and strategic perspective, and the need to ensure continuity and swiftness in the decision-making process”.Opposition parties on Monday raised objections over the government taking ordinance route to extend the tenures of CBI and ED directors, and then notifying the changes, just 15 days ahead of a Parliament session.Abhishek Singhvi, senior Congress MP and legal expert, dubbed the move “illegal” and a bid to keep the sleuths on a leash.“Keeping you on a leash, watching you and giving you incremental, partial, piecemeal extensions, because that allows me to be a control freak over you, that allows me to control, because I will say, next time please watch out, your provision in coming again after one year. You better behave into everything I tell you because then only you will get an extension,” Singhvi said, questioning the ordinance push ahead of the winter session.CPIM general secretary Sitaram Yechury demanded scrapping of the two ordinances.“Promulgation of 2 ordinances extending term of ED & CBI directors to 5 years on the eve of winter session of parliament is reprehensible. It’s against SC directions. CBI & ED are made to function as political arm of BJP. Rescind these ordinances,” said Yechury.There was no response from ministry of home affairs and Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) on the issue.The Delhi Special Police Establishment (Amendment) Ordinance, 2021 promulgated on Sunday, said the tenure of the CBI director can be extended up to one year at a time, provided “that no such extension shall be granted after the completion of a period of five years in total including the period mentioned in the initial appointment”.According to the Central Vigilance Commission (Amendment) Ordinance, 2021, which also came into effect on Sunday, the tenure of ED chief can be extended up to one year at a time “provided further that no such extension shall be granted after the completion of a period of five years in total including the period mentioned in the initial appointment”.The directors of CBI and ED have a normal fixed tenure of two years each.The tenure of ED chief Sanjay Kumar Mishra is due to end on Wednesday, and CBI chief Subodh Kumar Jaiswal’s tenure ends in May 2023.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-tweaks-fundamental-rules-to-cement-extended-tenure-of-ed-cbi-chiefs-101637000362698.html

Militants have been hiding on top floor of his building. As per source and digital evidence, he has been working as militant associate. Search is still going on,”The developments came a day after a policeman sustained injuries after suspected terrorists opened fire on a police party conducting raids in Old City area of Srinagar.Police said the raids were carried out following specific information about the presence of terrorists in Jamalata area of Nawa Kadal. As the team approached towards the suspected spot, the terrorists fired indiscriminately, injuring a policeman.Amid a surge in terrorist attacks, Srinagar city, particularly the Old City, has witnessed increased in such activity, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-terrorists-among-3-killed-in-hyderpora-encounter-jkpolice-101637000004899.html
16-11-2021||India||2 journalists arrested over Tripura violence reportage granted bail||Two women journalists arrested by Tripura police for alleged criminal conspiracy and spread of communal hatred while reporting on the October 26 violence in the state were granted bail by a magistrate’s court on Monday.Journalists Samriddhi K Sakunia and Swarna Jha, employed with Delhi-based news channel HW News Network, were arrested by Tripura police in the early hours of Monday, following their detention in Assam’s Karimganj district on Sunday. The two scribes were on their way to Silchar airport when Assam police, on instructions from their Tripura counterparts, detained them at Karimganj, close to the border of the two states.On Monday morning, Sakunia and Jha were brought back to Tripura and produced before the chief judicial magistrate’s court in Udaipur sub-division of Gomati district, which granted them bail on bail bonds of ₹75,000 each.“The court granted them bail with a bond of ₹75,000 and imposed a condition to appear before police and cooperate with them whenever required. Accordingly, they need to appear before Kakraban police station on Tuesday,” senior advocate Pijush Kanti Biswas, who appeared for the scribes on behalf of HW News Network, said. Biswas said the journalists had visited Tripura to report on the October 26 violence in which a mosque, a few houses and shops were allegedly vandalised by activists of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) in the north-eastern state. Biswas also alleged that police’s charges of spreading communal hatred were not found in the FIR copy.“The FIR copy did not have any mention of any such offence and their arrest shows police using their high-handedness. It is an attack and threat on democracy as well as a threat to the citizens and media’s right to express their opinion. The state was unfair in this issue,” Biswas said.HT tried to reach out to Tripura Police for a response but could not get one immediately.On Sunday, the two scribes were booked by Tripura police after one Kanchan Das accused them of delivering an “instigating speech” against the Hindu community and the Tripura government during their meeting with a few Muslim families at Palbazar in the state’s Unakoti district on November 13.In his complaint, Das, a resident of Kumarghat, alleged the two journalists claimed that the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and Bajrang Dal were behind the alleged vandalisation of a mosque during the violence last month.Subsequently, Tripura police registered two separate cases against the journalists. While one case was registered at Fatikroy police station in Unakoti district, on the basis of Das’ complaint, the other was filed at Kakraban police station in Gomati district.The two scribes were booked under sections 120B (criminal conspiracy), 153A (promoting enmity between two groups on grounds of religion) and 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace) of IPC at Fatikroy police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-journalists-arrested-over-tripura-violence-reportage-granted-bail-101636999943236.html
16-11-2021||India||Govt permits export of 50mn doses of Covovax, say officials||The Centre has permitted the export of around 50 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine Covovax produced by Serum Institute of India (SII) as part of a tie-up with US-based vaccine maker Novavax Inc, according to people familiar with the developments.Covovax has not been approved yet for emergency use in India. The government approval for the export of Covovax will help avoid wastage of nearly 10 million stockpiled Covovax doses which are due to expire in December. The vaccines were produced as part of SII’s agreement with Novavax Inc. for the development and commercialisation of NVX-CoV2373.SII chief executive officer Adar Poonawalla earlier told HT in an interview that his company intended to keep Covovax and Sputnik Light, the first component of the Russian coronavirus vaccine Sputnik V, for exports.“That is my sort of thinking and discussion with the government; and we are sort of aligned on that because Covishield is churning out enough volumes for the country… We do not need to increase the volumes; in fact anything more we make, we hope to export…,” Poonawalla said in an interview last month.On September 20, India’s health minister, Mansukh Mandaviya, also announced that India, the world’s largest vaccine maker, intended to resume export of surplus vaccine doses to “fulfil its commitment towards the world”. India stopped exports in April this year to accelerate the domestic inoculation drive at a time the second wave of Covid-19 infections exploded in the country.A person aware of the details on Monday said SII is likely to start production of Sputnik Light, its second vaccine aimed at exports, either this month-end or early next month.“We believe the manufacturing of the Russian Covid-19 vaccine could start anytime around month end or early next month as the company has got the requisite permissions in place and we have been made to understand that other requirements are also being arranged,” said a person aware of the matter, on condition of anonymity.In his interview, Poonawalla confirmed the tie-up with the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) that markets the Russian vaccine globally.“We recently tied up (with RDIF); we have done a tech transfer, I am told which has been successful. And we will start making some trial batches in a month or two,” said Poonawalla.RDIF in the past stated that the partnership intends to produce over 300 million doses of the vaccine in India per year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-permits-export-of-50mn-doses-of-covovax-sayofficials-101636999767020.html
16-11-2021||India||Experts call for crypto with proper regulation||Experts and key bodies have favoured a tightly controlled cryptocurrency regime in India over a blanket ban on the alternative payment ecosystem that will have strict transaction protocol and also imposition of taxes to help the government generate revenue.A note prepared by CII for Indian parliamentarians maintained that a “balanced and thoughtful regulatory approach to crypto/digital tokens needs to be evolved in India.” The industry body argued that “regulatory tool box should accept, not reject and outlaw, the new world of crypto/digital tokens.”Similarly, IIM Ahmedabad’s public policy alumni special interest group suggested to lawmakers that “Cryptocurrencies should be regulated, not banned”. Their presentation argued, that “regulation helps highlight and address issues or gaps, banning will push it underground.”There is no explicit legalisation of cryptocurrencies in India but a verdict of the Supreme Court (in the Internet and Mobile Association of India V. Reserve Bank of India case) declared an outright ban on cryptocurrencies but raised the possibility of RBI’s jurisdiction for all forms of virtual currencies. The ban had come into force in 2018.The Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021, building on a previous version of the bill, initially aimed to ban private cryptocurrency operators, and simultaneously empower the RBI to issue what is known as central bank digital currencies (CBDC), which in India’s case is likely to be Digital Rupees.The IIM body suggested that the CBDC “should be pegged 1:1 to INR making it India’s stablecoin.”It also pitched for registration of “all industry exchanges” and that “SEBI could be a natural regulator if crypto is treated as an asset, not currency.” It maintained crypto offerings can take place in the line of IPO and all “inflow/outflow to happen via formal banking channels.”Krishna V Iyer, a researcher in blockchain, told lawmakers to prescribe minimum networth/investment threshold and consider GST on every transaction. He also suggested additional taxes such as capital gains or miscellaneous income tax.CII too echoed a similar idea and said, “Treat crypto/digital tokens as ‘securities’ of a special class” in income tax law and GST law. It suggested that crypto/digital tokens can be treated as ‘capital assets’ for income tax purposes.Software body Isprit pointed out that with widespread telecom adoption, real-time payments system, and massive vaccine drive, India has the potential to be the fastest to scale up.“Crypto technology-powered Decentralised Digital Assets hold a market cap of over $3 Trillion. The future promise of digital assets has attracted lots of retail attention, but institutional investors too. Some of the world’s most visionary innovators and investors have thrown their hats in the ring to build upon this technology. Finding a viable way to participate in this new economy is almost essential for India,” it said.According to lawmakers familiar with the matter, a parliamentary panel will be exploring the issue further as it deliberates the impact and consequences of regulating cryptocurrency.“There is a lack of conceptual clarity among the members on what all cryptocurrency or crypto-assets entail,” a person familiar with the matter said. “There are fundamental questions that still need to be answered before the currency, which is barely a line of code, can be regulated.”A second person said that the standing committee will be tabling a report on the issue. “The committee hasn’t even heard from the government yet,” the person said. “Even the stakeholders could not explain what will happen in a situation where the currency is misused, or abused, or used to cheat people.”The first person added that while the stakeholders batted for the adoption of crypto, currency remains a sovereign domain. “It is held, managed and distributed in a centralised manner. (But) take for instance Bitcoin, one doesn’t even know where it originated from. Moreover, the question of the intrinsic value of cryptocurrency also arises.”Congress MP Manish Tewari said that regulating crypto is a daunting task. “Regulating cryptocurrency is much like attempting to regulate trolls on the internet,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyptocurrency-regulation-helps-highlight-issues-banning-will-push-it-underground-experts-101636994904093.html
16-11-2021||India||SC slams Centre, Delhi govt on Capital’s unending air crisis||The Supreme Court on Monday lamented that it was being “forced to set the agenda” on the pollution crisis in the National Capital Region (NCR) as it pulled up the Delhi government for “passing the buck”, the Centre for not proposing “drastic measures”, and NCR states for doing little to control what has become an annual public health crisis.In a hearing on Monday, a bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana, gave the Centre and state governments of Delhi, Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh 24 hours to hold an emergency meeting and prepare a list of urgent steps that can be put in place immediately to bring down the levels of pollution in the “forseeable future”.“We want you to come out with concrete action plan by tomorrow. All the three governments and the Centre (must) come out with concrete steps. Otherwise, don’t blame us for passing any direction we deem appropriate,” said the bench, fixing Wednesday as the next day of hearing.The bench, which alsoincluded justices DY Chandrachud and Surya Kant, listed out the areas of concern, including work for home for all offices in Delhi, and dissuading farmers from burning stubble for two weeks in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.The focus of the court, however, was clearly on emergency mitigation to control local sources of pollution, asking for the Centre and states to focus on curtailing activities such as construction, traffic and road transport, industries, and power plants.“It is very unfortunate we have to set an agenda for the governments. When we heard this matter on Friday, we thought you will conduct a meeting and come up with something concrete. But nothing is there... tell us about the drastic steps that you must take to bring down the levels of pollution in the next two-three days,” the bench told solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who appeared for the Centre.It reiterated that the Centre and Delhi government should consider a lockdown of a few days in the national capital to control the road traffic and vehicular pollution, besides curtailing road dust which, according to the governments, has been a prime cause of pollution.The court’s directions come at the time when pollution in the region has oscillated between “severe” (400-plus) and “very poor” (300-400) – hazardous levels on the air quality index (AQI) scale – as they do every year in the first few weeks of November, and none of the measures put in place by administrations at various levels seem to have worked. Except for Sunday, when it was 330, the AQI has been at the upper end of very poor or well into severe category since Diwali on November 4.Farm firesWhen the hearing commenced on Monday, senior counsel Vikas Singh, appearing for the 17-year-old petitioner, Aditya Dubey, blamed politics for not taking action against farmers even though stubble burning has been a major contributor to air pollution in the pre-winter weeks. He said that because Punjab and Uttar Pradesh go for the assembly polls next year, no steps are being taken.“We don’t want any politics. We only want pollution to come down. We are not concerned with election or politics. Let us see how pollution can be brought down,” retorted the bench.On his part, the S-G read out from the affidavits filed by the Union government regarding the steps taken by various authorities, and conceded that stubble burning is not a chief contributor to the worsening air quality.He said that farm fires contributed a meagre 10% to the bad air a day ago and they are problematic only during the two months in the pre-winter and winter weeks.“Are you agreeing in principle that farm fires is not a chief reason for rise in pollution? So, all the hue and cry over farm fires actually had no legal, scientific or rational basis... your own affidavit shows that stubble burning contributes only 4% annually. So, we are trying to target something which is an insignificant source of pollution,” said the bench.It pointed out that the Centre’s own submissions showed that 75% of the pollution is due to three factors -- industries, road dust, and vehicles. “If we have to reduce the pollution drastically, you will have to focus on these three factors to see the effect in the next few days. So, you have to tell us what are the steps that you plan to take immediately. Why don’t you stop plying of vehicles in Delhi for two days? This is a decision you have to take,” said the bench.It noted that although some decisions were taken by the authorities over the last two days, they “have not yet indicated the broader steps that they are going to take to control the factors which are responsible for poor air quality.”“The moment we say something, you start saying we are overreaching, etc. But what to do when we need to even fix the agenda of your meetings,” it remarked.The court also pulled up the counsel for the Punjab government for not taking effective steps to mitigate the issue. “In your affidavit, you are very loudly saying that you have imposed fines on farmers for stubble burning in terms of the order of the National Green Tribunal. But why are you completely silent on what incentives are providing to these farmers? You don’t disclose anything in your affidavit about incentivising them and what you propose is just a paper exercise,” it commented.Lockdown in Delhi?Mehta responded that certain drastic measures in contemplation included imposing a lockdown in the Capital, besides completely stopping entry of trucks in Delhi. However, the S-G added, experts have advised that these steps could wait.Senior counsel Rahul Mehra, representing the Delhi government, said that the city government was willing to impose a lockdown but this will have to be implemented through the NCR, including the cities in Delhi’s adjoining states of UP and Haryana.“We are only concerned about bringing down the pollution levels. You need to decide what steps are to be taken,” replied the court.The Delhi government was also reproached by the bench when it could not give out details of the road cleaning machines that were deployed in the national capital. Instead, Mehra submitted that BJP-headed municipal corporations should apprise the court of these details.“You are only passing the buck. Your lame excuses will force us to hold an audit of revenue you are earning and spending on popularity slogans. People are suffering and you are not bothered,” the bench told Mehra.Mehra said that the city government is willing to take all possible steps and would also release more funds for the machines immediately.The court then adjourned the hearing to Wednesday, asking the Centre and states to enumerate the steps to be taken immediately.The air quality crisis in the Delhi has been an annual affair with recordings illustrating the problem only 2015 onwards.A significant change of meteorological parameters and the combination of two man-made factors – farm fires and Diwali celebrations – invariably combine to push the quality of air into zones unfit for breathing.Beginning mid-October, winter conditions begin to develop, marked by a drop-off in winds. These winds come in from the northwest, as opposed to the southeast during monsoon, and carry ultrafine PM2.5 particles that originated as smoke from farm fires.This period is also the peak for farm fires as farmers clear paddy stubble left behind after harvest – this year, 77,997 fires were spotted between October 1 and November 14, according to the Suomi-NPP satellite’s VIIRS algorithm. This is the second highest number of fires for this interval seen since 2012 -- the earliest year for which this satellite has data -- after 2016, when 94,803 fires were observed by the satellite.Diwali celebrations, which too fall in October-November period, further add to the air pollution temporarily as people burst firecrackers despite a long-standing ban.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-slams-centre-delhi-govt-on-capital-s-unending-air-crisis-101636994422182.html

16-11-2021||India||UP no more a BIMARU state, second-largest economy after Maharashtra: Govt official||Uttar Pradesh is a crime-free state now, with action being taken against every known criminal in the state. Talking about the law and order situation in the state, additional chief secretary (Home), Awanish K Awasthi, said on Monday that properties owned by both petty and big criminals worth ₹1,900 crore have been seized."The crime rate has come down drastically in Uttar Pradesh. There is no danga (riots) in our state now as this government has a zero tolerance policy against such elements," said Awasthi.Another top official, who also interacted with the media, said that Uttar Pradesh now has the second-largest economy in the country after Maharashtra."According to data from the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), Uttar Pradesh has more than 55 lakh demat accounts (used for trading in stock exchange), highest after Maharashtra and Gujarat. It is no longer a BIMARU state," said Navneet Sehgal, additional chief secretary (Information and MSME).The acronym BIMARU (or sick) was coined by the noted demographer Ashish Bose in the 1980s to refer to states which were lagging behind and retarding India's overall development. The terminology was later called "outdated" by many governments, which showcased the development in their respective states."While Maharashtra has 1.56 crore demat accounts, Gujarat has 88 lakh. Karnataka is at number four with 44 lakh demat accounts, followed by Andhra Pradesh with 37 lakh trading accounts," said Sehgal.He added that these accounts are not concentrated in more developed districts like Noida or Ghaziabad (which are closer to Delhi), but are spread across the state.Further, Awasthi said that ₹4.5 lakh crore of investment has been received by the Uttar Pradesh government from various industries. "We are also bringing investment to the defence corridor. The government is aiming to get ₹10,000 crore worth of investment," he added.The briefing was held a day before Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurates the Purvanchal Expressway, a flagship project of the Yogi Adityanath government. It is being launched months ahead of the assembly elections in the state.The state government is developing a defence corridor to expand the defence manufacturing capability and reduce foreign dependency, the expressway will give it a boost by allowing faster and easier transport of goods across the corridor. The UP government has declared six districts — Aligarh, Agra, Jhansi, Lucknow, Kanpur and Chitrakoot — as part of a defence node and procured 1,482.4 hectares of land.The state government has also signed 68 memorandums of understanding (MoUs) for the defence corridor, including with BrahMos, the joint venture between DRDO and Russia's NPOM. BrahMos Aerospace has proposed to set up a modern production facility in Lucknow with an investment of ₹9,300 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttar-pradesh-a-crime-free-state-now-says-top-government-official-101636990146937.html
16-11-2021||India||What is the contribution of stubble burning to Delhi’s pollution?||In an affidavit filed in the Supreme Court, the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change has said that stubble burning is not a major contributor to high levels of pollution in Delhi. “As per a scientific study carried out and to get indicative figures to show average sectoral contributions in PM 2.5 and PM 10 concentrations in Delhi” the respective contribution of agricultural burning to PM 2.5 and PM10 was just 4% and 7% each in winter and summer, the affidavit said. An HT analysis of pollution data and scientific research shows that these numbers don’t tell the real story. Here are four charts which explain why.Have farm fires contributed just 4% to Delhi’s current pollution levels this winter?Between October 20 and November 14 this year, Delhi’s Air Quality Index (AQI) has been in the severe zone (401-500) on seven days. On each of these days, the contribution of farm fires to Delhi’s PM 2.5 contribution was between 26%-48%. These numbers may fly in the face of the claim made by the Union ministry of environment in the Supreme Court that seemed to suggest that stubble burning by farmers in Punjab and Haryana was not really the problem for Delhi’s bad air. Because Safar data on contribution of farm fires – it is the only publicly available data source – is available only from October 20, this analysis cannot be carried out for a longer period.So where did the government get its 4-7% figure from?That is most likely an average number for the entire year. If the same logic were to be applied, pollution is not as big a problem in Delhi. The same affidavit shows that between 2016 and 2020, the number of “severe” AQI days in Delhi was never more than 25. Even if one were to add the number of “very poor” AQI days (readings between 301 and 400) to the number it comes between 64 (2020) and 126 (2016) during this period. Clearly, days with higher AQIs are a bigger problem than days when the AQI is not so bad. And, as has been shown above, contribution of farm fires is significant when AQI levels are higher.Spike in farm fires coincides with rise in AQI levelsUnlike AQI and PM 2.5 numbers, data on the contribution of farm fires to PM 2.5 levels in Delhi is not available for the period before October 20. What we do have is daily data at a high resolution from 2012 onward on the number of fires seen in Punjab and Haryana from satellites. Reading this data with PM 2.5 levels in Delhi from 2018 onwards (air quality stations were much fewer before 2018) shows that there is a broad resonance in the period when farm fires and pollution levels peak in the city.Low contribution of farm fires to pollution is an aberration, not the normTo be sure, there does exist research to show that even on days when farm fires are rampant, their contribution to Delhi’s PM 2.5 levels can be low. However, this is more an aberration due to favourable climatic conditions than proof of farm fires being benign for Delhi’s pollution levels. A 2018 article, Objective evaluation of stubble emission of North India and quantifying its impact on air quality of Delhi, published in the international journal Science of the Total Environment gives a useful insight into this question. “Although the stubble burning was a regular process during the said period (October 10-December 10, 2018), with varied fire count, the impact of biomass burning on Delhi’s PM 2.5 is found to vary on day -to day basis with percentage contribution of stubble burning ranging from 1% to 58% as it is highly dependent on transportation pathway of air mass, controlled by source to target region meteorological parameters led by wind direction and wind speed,” the paper says.“The impact of stubble burning on Delhi’s air quality depends not only on amount of biomass burned in Punjab and Haryana but a combined effect of high wind speed at intrusion height, wind direction and air residence time in the Delhi airshed,” the paper says.Given the fact that no policy can control meteorological factors such as wind speed and direction, it makes eminent sense to make efforts to control farm fires rather than hoping for a divine intervention on the meteorological front. None of this, of course, is to say that other factors are not responsible for pollution in Delhi, or other steps need not be taken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-is-the-contribution-of-stubble-burning-to-delhi-s-pollution-101636988661697.html
16-11-2021||India||Anil Deshmukh sent to judicial custody||A special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court on Monday remanded former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh to judicial custody. The 72-year-old Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader was arrested by the enforcement directorate (ED) on November 2 in connection with a money-laundering case against him. He was sent to Arthur Road jail in south central Mumbai. Deshmukh was produced before the special court on Monday, the day his 14-day ED custody ended. Additional sessions judge HS Satbhai remanded him to judicial custody. The special court also allowed his pleas for home food, medicines and a bed for him in jail. ED had registered a money-laundering case against Deshmukh on May 11 this year on the basis of an April 21 First Information Report (FIR) of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which, in turn, was based on allegations of corruption levelled by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh. In a letter written to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on March 20, Singh had alleged that Deshmukh had instructed certain Mumbai police officers to collect of ₹100 crore every month from Mumbai’s restaurants and bars. ED’s lawyers pointed out that the agency’s probe revealed that, on Deshmukh’s instructions, Sachin Vaze – an assistant police inspector in Mumbai – had called a meeting of bar owners, and that, between December 2020 and February 2021 collected ₹4.7 crore from the owners of so-called orchestra bars in Mumbai to avoid police interference. In his statement to ED, Vaze reportedly revealed that he handed over the “extorted money” in two instalments to Deshmukh’s aide Kundan Shinde. Subsequently, they said, Deshmukh’s son Hrishikesh received an amount of ₹4.18 crore routed through Delhi-based shell entities as donations to a Deshmukh-led charitable trust, Shri Sai Shikshan Sanstha, Nagpur. On June 26, ED arrested Shinde and Deshmukh’s personal secretary Sanjeev Palande in the money-laundering case, and on August 23, filed a charge sheet against them. Vaze is also an accused in the charge sheet. Also Read: Curfew in Maharashtra’s Amravati expanded to four towns as BJP stages protestIn July 2021, ED has provisionally attached Deshmukh’s properties worth ₹4.2 crore, which included the NCP leader’s residential flat at Worli, valued at ₹ 1.54 crore, and 25 land parcels worth ₹2.67 crore, at Dhutum village in the neighbouring Raigad district. The properties were held in name Deshmukh’s wife Aarti and a company named Premier Port Links Pvt Ltd. ED officers said Deshmukh family had acquired 50% ownership in this company, including its assets i.e. land and shops valued at approximately ₹5.34 crore by paying just ₹17.95 lakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/anil-deshmukh-sent-to-judicial-custody-101636967185360.html
