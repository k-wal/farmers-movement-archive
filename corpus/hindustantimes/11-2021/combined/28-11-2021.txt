28-11-2021||Lucknow||Mann ki Baat: PM praises people’s efforts to restore Noon river in UP’s Jalaun||Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his monthly “Mann ki Baat” session on Sunday praised people’s collective efforts to rejuvenate the Noon river in Jalaun district of Uttar Pradesh, said the state government in a statement. “Noon river was on the verge of extinction. The river had virtually turned into a drain causing an irrigation crisis in the area. It was then that people made the resolution to restore it. A committee was formed in May this year and thousands of villagers and panchayats voluntarily joined the mission to revitalise the river. As a result, the river stands restored today with “sabka prayas (collective effort),” said the PM according to the statement.“Noon river has been rejuvenated in very little time and at little cost with people’s effort. It is a brilliant example of how people’s will can do wonders. When we protect nature, it also protects us,” the PM added.Earlier on June 28 last year during his Mann ki Baat session, PM Modi had lauded the Uttar Pradesh government led by chief minister Yogi Adityanath for the rejuvenation of the river Kalyani in the Barabanki district of UP.The statement also said the UP government has revitalised dozens of rivers since 2018 as part of its vision to protect the environment. In the financial year 2018-19, the government rejuvenated six rivers, including Aril, Mandakini, Karnavati, Varuna, Morva and Gomti. In 2019-20, nineteen rivers spread over 26 districts, including Tedhi, Manorama, Pandu, Varuna, and Sasur Khadedi, were restored. Similarly in 2020-21, twenty-five rivers in 36 districts were rejuvenated. The statement said CM Yogi Adityanath thanked the PM for his continuous support.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/mann-ki-baat-pm-praises-people-s-efforts-to-restore-noon-river-in-up-s-jalaun-101638123981965.html
28-11-2021||Delhi||AAP’s MCD poll campaign to kick off this week: Gopal Rai||New Delhi: Ahead of the municipal elections scheduled for early next year, Delhi environment minister and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) state convenor Gopal Rai on Sunday said that his party will launch the poll campaign from Thursday.Also Read | Delhi: Municipal bodies hunt for cash crunch fix ahead of next year’s pollsRai said that responsibilities have been assigned to the office-bearers for the “MCD Badlaav” campaign which will also see the use of a dedicated mobile application to assist the drive. He added that an in-charge will be appointed in each division.“On December 5, teams in every division of Delhi will launch the campaign at the ground level by placing help desks,” Rai said.According to Rai, AAP functionaries will also carry out a membership drive under this campaign. “We will upload the data through a special app to streamline the data and for efficient work. The training for this app will be given at the party office. On Saturday, the district teams of the party’s state organisation, observers, and the speaker and organisation ministers from each assembly were trained at the party office,” he said, adding that a series of training sessions have been planned between November 28 and December 1.Rai said that the party has further finalised the members who will be in-charge of the campaign from each mandal, adding that the idea is to have at least 8-10 people in every street.AAP national secretary Pankaj Gupta said that the aim is to have about 50 names from every booth. “Out of them, at least two people should be the ones to whom we can give the responsibility,” Gupta said.As the five-year term of three municipal corporations is set to expire in April 2022, Delhi will be holding elections to elect 272 municipal councillors in three municipal corporations early next year. The North and South MCDs have 104 municipal wards while EDMC has 64 municipal wards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aaps-mcd-poll-campaign-to-kick-off-this-week-gopal-rai-101638123924405.html
28-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s east civic body push for stray adoption: Free vaccines, sterilisations||In a bid to encourage the adoption of community dogs (the correct term for strays) in the trans-Yamuna area, the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) will help with free sterilisation, vaccination and registration of the canines. EDMC commissioner Vikas Anand said that the civic body will also run a campaign for the adoption of community dogs. “If anyone wants to adopt a community dog, the municipal corporation will complete vaccination, registration and other formalities,” Anand said, adding that interested people can contact the veterinary department through EDMC helplines.Dr Mool Chand, who heads the veterinary department in east Delhi, said that an institutionalised community dog adoption programme is being set up. “We are working with two NGOs who are running sterilisation and vaccination programmes in animal birth control centres. Every colony has community dogs and we are trying to encourage the adoption of community dogs. Free vaccination, sterilisation and registration can be an incentive,” he added. The veterinary director said that people can adopt more than one community dog. “We hope that this will also help resolve the conflict between people who feed and care for dogs and residents who do not want such dogs in their neighbourhood. The dogs will be officially registered under the adopter’s name and live with them,” he added.The civic body also plans to increase the number of animal birth control centres and tenders will soon be issued to find interested NGOs, Dr Chand said. “We have two operational centres in Usmanpur and Ghazipur. Delhi has 16 such animal birth control centres. We are paying NGOs ₹1,000 per dog for sterilisation and vaccination, and ₹900 in case the animal is also picked up and transported by the veterinary department,” an official said. The government does not have data on how many community dogs roam around on Delhi streets. “The last pan-Delhi survey was conducted by the erstwhile united MCD in 2009, when the number of community dogs was found to be over 560,000. Officials said that the number must have only increased in the following years.The national Capital has a chequered history of tackling its community dog population. Once the community dog population skyrocketed in the 1990s, corporations started feeding them the neurotoxin poison strychnine, which leads to convulsions and painful death. The practice was stopped in 2001, after which civic bodies tried using chemosterilant Talsur---a drug injected in male dogs’ reproductive parts---but this too proved to be ineffective and painful for the dogs, an official said. Since then, civic bodies have been using operative sterilisation to control the dog population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-east-civic-body-push-for-stray-adoption-free-vaccines-sterilisations-101638123921897.html

They said they received a PCR call at Shastri Park police station regarding a fatal accident. The complainant Mohammad Muid (34) stated his friend Poonam, a resident of Cigarette Wala Bagh in Model Town, was returning from Haridwar. He said he picked her up from Old Delhi railway station and was taking her to Khajuri Khas on his scooter.When Muid crossed the Yudhister Setu, a truck hit his scooter and he and Poonam fell. Later, the truck ran over Poonam and the driver tried to flee the spot, a senior police officer said.The driver was caught by a head constable, Mamchand. While Muid was injured, Poonam was immediately taken to a hospital but was declared dead on arrival, police said.A case under sections 279 (rash driving or riding on a public way), 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) and 304A (causing death by negligence) was registered at Shastri Park police station and the accused driver taken into custody, the officer said.Police identified the driver as Pramod Kumar (35), a resident of Pilibhit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/speeding-truck-kills-phd-student-in-northeast-delhi-s-shastri-park-101638123742922.html
28-11-2021||Delhi||Pandemic catalyses growth of CNG crematoriums, but ​Delhi falls back to traditional ways||The subsequent waves of Covid-19 pandemic pushed alternative cremation methods into prominence in the city earlier this year but the demand for CNG and electric crematoriums have dwindled drastically in the subsequent months as people have returned to traditional wood-based cremations.Delhi had just two CNG crematoria earlier -- at Nigambodh Ghat and Punjabi Bagh Shamshan Bhumi -- but the pandemic saw the government doubling the number of furnaces at these facilities, and setting up new units in places like Green Park, Karkardooma, Subhash Nagar and Ghazipur.Avdhesh Kumar, funeral supervisor at the city’s biggest cremation ground at Nigambodh Ghat, said that people are returning to traditional funerals. “Almost everyone now prefers wood-based traditional cremation instead of CNG cremations, which is now less than 10%. When there was rush due to Covid, the CNG furnaces were in very high demand as people wanted a quicker medium. If there are around 50 normal wood-based cremations in a day, we get hardly 5-6 requests for CNG units now,” Kumar said.​Suman Gupta, the chief-coordinator of the NGO managing the ghat, too said that the preference for wood-based cremations is “clearly several-fold higher than CNG”.Across the western part of the city, Punjabi Bagh Shamshan Bhumi operates second largest battery of four CNG hearths but the funeral managers claim that these are barely utilised. “...some have religious apprehensions about the alternative methods. Many of them state that relatives will object to a non-traditional method,” said a funeral manager. A senior SDMC official overseeing the Punjabi Bagh and Subhash Nagar CNG units agreed. “Given an option, people are once again opting for wooden platforms and not for the CNG units,” the official said.​In the last one year alone, five new CNG crematorium sites -- in Dwarka Sector 24, Jwala Nagar, Seemapuri and Aya Nagar -- have been approved. The MCDs are inclined towards CNG crematoriums as electric ones are costlier due to high commercial electricity rates and filament maintenance, and they face regular tripping of power connections. Officials said that the electric unit at Green Park, which was laying unused for years, was converted to CNG in February this year, and the electric crematorium at Sarai Kale Khan is used only to cremate unclaimed bodies.Before the onset of the pandemic, the city used to see around 90,000 cremations every year, out of which over 90% were wood-based traditional cremations. The latest statistics released by the Delhi government in the ‘Annual Report on Registration of Births & Deaths in Delhi-2020’ shows that over 140,000 deaths were registered in 2020. The data for 2021 has not been released though. As per the daily Covid bulletin released by the Delhi government, the city has seen 25,097 deaths since the pandemic began in March 2020, but several news reports claim the number may be more than twice this figure.“Every year, Delhi witnesses deaths of people coming for treatment in its hospitals. On removing the burials in other communities and infant deaths, we estimate that at least 80,000 to 90,000 wood-based cremations are taking place every year,” said a senior public health official overseeing the operations of funeral sites in the city.Adding to pollution Each wood based traditional cremation utilises 400-500kg of wood and it is estimated that at least 32 million kilos of wood is consumed in the shamshan bhumis of the city. Delhi witnessed wood shortage in April-May period as demand grew sharply due to Covid related deaths. A 2016 study conducted by IIT Kanpur, which took a conservative amount of 216kg wood per funeral and assessed only 53 cremation sites, indicated that cremation sites are adding 4% of toxic carbon monoxide emissions into Delhi’s air. It concluded that over 2,129kg carbon monoxide, 33kg of sulphur dioxide, 346kg of PM10 and 312kg of PM2.5 dust particles were being emitted every day by cremations. While hearing a 2016 case, the National Green Tribunal had directed the Union environment ministry and the Delhi government to initiate programmes to provide alternative modes of cremation, saying the “traditional method of wooden pyres emitted hazardous pollutants into the environment”.Anshul Garg, director of Mokshda - a company that sets up metallic funeral pyre systems that consume less wood, feels that a midway can also be found in fulfilling the religious sentiments while also reducing the pollution load due to traditional cremations. Noting it is not easy to suddenly change the feelings and religious sentiments of people, he said CNG/electric cremations will remain low under normal circumstances. “We use ashtdhatu frames, which improve air circulation and maximise the heat utilisation. It leads to only 1/4th of wood being used in each cremation while the chimney captures most of the harmful pollutants,” he explained. Mokshda has installed 19 such units in Delhi-NCR at nine locations and 54 units across seven states, including Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. Kumar at Nigambodh argued that followers of certain religious sects, where gurus and spiritual leaders are pushing people to opt for eco-friendly cremations, are showing an inclination towards CNG/electric funerals.“Nirankaris for instance have shown preference for CNG units as it has been a part of the discourse. In 2016, when a key head of a sect passed away in a road accident, he was cremated using CNG pyre method.at Nigambodh Ghat. Spiritual leaders will have to convince people to opt for greener ways to remove the hesitation,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/pandemic-catalyses-growth-of-cng-crematoriums-but-delhi-falls-back-to-traditional-ways-101638123681666.html
28-11-2021||Delhi||Business Blasters: Delhi govt starts TV programme for project pitches||To scale up its Business Blasters programme, the Delhi government on Sunday launched a television programme to allow school students to pitch their projects to investors.As part of the Business Blasters, a programme launched in September, students in classes 11 and 12 will be mentored and provided financial capital of ₹2,000 as seed money to help kickstart their business ideas. It is a part of the Entrepreneur Mindset Curriculum (EMC) for classes 11 and 12, designed to train students to work in teams, brainstorm and identify social challenges or business opportunities, prepare business plans and implement ideas in their neighbourhoods.Speaking at the launch of the television event, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said that the Business Blasters programme will provide a launchpad for students’ business ideas and encourage confidence and a problem-solving mindset, which will benefit India’s economy in the future.“It is encouraging to see children pitch some creative ideas which when scaled have the potential of bringing about tremendous social impact. This programme, for the students of classes 11 and 12, is going to form the basis of the country’s progress. Through this, children will not run after jobs, but jobs will come after these children,” said Sisodia, who holds the education portfolio.The first episode of the eight-part series that kicked off on Sunday saw three teams competing against each other. The three teams sought investment for their businesses of low-cost Bluetooth speakers, high-quality compost, and paintings.“We were given a seed amount of ₹2,000, and with our paintings, we managed to earn a profit of ₹30,000. The Business Blasters programme has taught us things we learn after college now. This includes how to communicate with people, customer management, the value of money and most importantly time management,” said Divyanshi, 16, a member of the team that sold paintings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/business-blasters-delhi-govt-starts-tv-programme-for-project-pitches-101638123503079.html
28-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Municipal bodies hunt for cash crunch fix ahead of next year’s polls||The poor financial health of Delhi’s three municipalities could be a serious handicap to the Bharatiya Janata Party’s ambition to retain control of the civic bodies it has helmed for over 14 years, a concern highlighted by strikes by resident doctors in North Delhi civic hospitals over unpaid salaries.Also Read | AAP’s MCD poll campaign to kick off this week: Gopal RaiThe municipal corporations need a plan to resolve the severe cash crunch before the upcoming elections to the civic bodies, party leaders said.The corporations’ poor rankings in the recent Swachh Survekshan have compounded the BJP’s concerns. The South Delhi corporation ranked 31st, the North corporation 43rd, while the East body cropped up in the bottom four, ranking 45th.“While we have to deal with anti-incumbency, the bigger issue is the poor corporations’ financial position,” said Jai Prakash, a BJP leader and former mayor of the North corporation. “We are unable to pay salaries on time due to delay in payment from the state government. But it is difficult to explain it to our employees, who are also voters in Delhi. We have taken up the matter with the party.”The three civic bodies have been rocked by fresh protests by resident doctors and paramedical staff of the North Delhi corporation due to salary delays. This agitation on Saturday may snowball into a wider strike, after the Confederation of MCD Employees Unions, which comprises 22 municipal workers’ unions, threatened to stay away from work from December 13 if their issues were not solved by then.While the party has been targeting the Aam Aadmi Party-led Delhi government for “paralysing the corporations by stalling the funds” and held several protests in this regard, the corporations themselves have done little to improve revenue.The three corporations recently initiated a process to finalise the budget for financial year 2022-23, in which South and East corporations have proposed a hike in property tax to tide over the financial crisis. None of the three corporations have proposed any major infrastructure projects due to the funds crunch. With municipal elections scheduled early next year, chances of BJP-led corporations passing the resolution are slim.Unifying the corporations could solve the problem, Prakash said. “If not the corporations, then the finance and planning departments should be unified to overcome the financial crisis. We proposed this earlier this year,” he said.The AAP, however, said corruption and financial mismanagement in the corporations was to blame for the financial crisis.Durgesh Pathak, in-charge of the party’s municipal affairs, said, “They are blaming the Delhi government to hide their inefficiencies. The problem is corruption and financial mismanagement. They are not able to streamline property tax collection due to which the collection is far less than what it should be. Ideally, the corporation should be getting over ₹2,000 crore as revenue from property tax, but they are able to collect around ₹600 crore.”But the bigger issue, Pathak said, is the BJP’s failure to improve sanitation in the city in the past 15 years. “The three civic bodies in the capital are not even in the top 10 or 20 of the Swachh Survekshan rankings. The issue of lack of sanitation directly impacts people, but the corporations have done little,” said Pathak.Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said that the corporations’ functioning will improve dramatically if the government releases the funds on time and clear the dues. “We are facing problems in giving salaries on time due to the delay in payment of funds by the government. It is a big issue and we are exploring other ways to address this issue. As for sanitation, the corporations have installed compactors to make the city dhalao-free. We are trying to manage everything in the limited funds we have,” said Gupta.He said that the corporations have done a lot of good work despite the fund crunch. “People, including our employees, understand this. While we will tell people about the work done by us despite shortage of funds, we will also tell them about the lack of work done by the government that has all the funds at its disposal,” he said.This is what the party is trying to achieve through its Jhuggi Samman Yatra, which started in mid-October. On November 29, BJP president JP Nadda will attend the last day of the 45-day-long campaign. “The slum clusters in the city don’t have basic facilities despite the government having all the funds. The corporations have still done a lot of work despite the fund crunch. This is what we are telling the people in our outreach campaigns,” said Gupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-municipal-bodies-hunt-for-cash-crunch-fix-ahead-of-next-year-s-polls-101638123383835.html
28-11-2021||Lucknow||Previous UP govts robbed people of their rights: CM Yogi||Chief minister Yogi Adityanath launched projects worth ₹200 crore in Deoria on Sunday. Speaking on the occasion at Raghu Raj Singh Inter College there, the chief minister said while 35 medical colleges were established in UP in nearly last five year of the BJP rule, only 12 medical colleges could be set up in the state during 70 years after independence. Attacking opposition parties for criticising his government’s action against mafias, Yogi said that the Samajwadi Party (SP), the Congress and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) were feeling bad after the houses of the Mafiosi were razed. “Mafias under the patronage of previous governments used to seize lands of the poor and raised money by extorting business men and traders. Should we not act against such mafias,” he asked to which the crowd repiled in the affirmative.“Earlier when Durga Puja came, riots would occur in Bhatpar Rani (the place where the CM’s event on held). When other festival came, riots would take place then too. In Deoria alone, three major riots took place during the SP government when weapons of police were looted from police stations. Back then, the government stood by rioters and not by victims. However, in the four-and-a-half-years of BJP government, not a single riot has taken place,” he said. “The earlier government was entangled in a Mahabharat with cheaters like ‘Chacha-Bhanja’ and ‘Bua’ and people were robbed of their rights,” Yogi added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/previous-up-govts-robbed-people-of-their-rights-cm-yogi-101638123321588.html
28-11-2021||Noida||Increase in wind speed may improve air quality in Noida, Ghaziabad||Some respite is likely in store for Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad, which have been reeling under ‘very poor’ air at least for the last five days till Sunday, as the forecast by Safar indicates that there might be a slight improvement in the air quality over the next two days (November 29 and 30) due to increase in wind speed. According to the air quality index bulletin issued by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Ghaziabad, Greater Noida and Noida recorded AQI values of 353, 346 and 362, respectively, on Sunday. “Local surface winds are likely to increase moderately on 29th and 30th (November) that increases dispersion of pollutants leading to slight improvement but AQI remains in ‘very poor’ category. From December 1, wind speed and temperature are likely to decrease reducing ventilation and leading to slight deterioration of air quality. Low mixing layer height is preventing efficient dispersion of pollutants,” said the forecast by the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar). Experts, on the other hand, said there are chances of a western disturbance around December 5-6. “This could lead to snowfall in hilly regions and light rains may take place in Delhi-NCR. The rainfall may be moderate in Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh. Due to this, there is likelihood of further drop in temperature, which may lead to foggy conditions after December 7,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, meteorology and climate change, Skymet. “The rainfall would prove beneficial as it is likely to bring down the pollution levels,” he added. Officials of the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) said they are implementing measures, such as road sweeping and water sprinkling, to control local sources of pollution. “Ghaziabad’s AQI levels have come down. However, our overall AQI has been affected for the past one week due to high pollution levels at Loni, where road construction is going on. We have asked the concerned agencies to take up corrective measures,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB, Ghaziabad. In Noida, the air quality readings recorded at the Sector-62 monitoring station is adversely affecting the overall AQI. “Air pollution levels have spiked sharply at the Sector 62 monitoring station. We are trying to find the reasons for the high pollution levels but nothing has come to the fore till now. Since this station is of the Indian Meteorological Department, we have asked them to re-calibrate the sub-station in order to resolve the issue. All the local measures to curb pollution are already in place across the city,” said Praveen Kumar, regional officer of UPPCB, Noida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/increase-in-wind-speed-may-improve-air-quality-in-noida-ghaziabad-101638122902270.html

28-11-2021||Noida||Greater Noida: Fresh tender floated to hire coaches for sports complex||The Greater Noida authority has revised the terms and conditions for hiring coaches and private agencies, which are interested in offering coaching services for different sports at the Shaheed Vijay Singh Pathik sports complex, and floated a fresh tender on November 26. Spread across 39 acres, the state-of-the-art sports facility was readied in 2015 but it could not be run by a professional agency. In 2015, the Greater Noida authority promised that the facility, which was constructed at an estimated cost of ₹130 crore, will be opened to the public in 2016. However, the authority has not been able to open the facility for public use till now. The Greater Noida authority will hire an agency or coach for sports, such as cricket, tennis, gym, basket ball, volleyball, skating, shooting, football and boxing. It is likely to appoint an agency to run and look after the maintenance of the swimming pool and four-walled court to be provided for playing squash. Interested coaches and agencies can apply till December 10 to participate in the bidding process. In July this year, the authority issued a tender to select the agency or coach but it did not get the desired response. It will open technical bids on December 13 to evaluate the eligibility criteria of agencies and coaches. “We have revised some terms and conditions and issued request for proposal to select an agency and coaches. Hopefully this time, the authority will be able to hire the agency and coaches,” said Narendra Bhooshan, CEO of Greater Noida authority.According to the revised terms and conditions, an agency which wants to offer coaching services for a particular sport will have to show their balance sheet (financial statements) of the last five years, unlike the previous rule which mandated disclosing financial statements of three years. The condition has been relaxed because the Covid-19 pandemic, which was raging for most of last year as well as this year, has impacted the businesses of sports agencies, said officials. The authority has also removed the condition that a coach will have to look after the maintenance of a facility used for the particular sport for which he will be offering his services. With these relaxed conditions, the authority hopes to start offering coaching services in a month’s time. The authority has made available a contact number 0120-2336015, where an interested coach/agency can call and seek more information.The sports complex has a cricket ground with a seating capacity for 10,000 people, a swimming pool the size of the one used in Olympics, a shooting range, a football ground, a skating rink, a 12-lane bowling area as per the international standards along with other facilities such as a changing room for players, toilets, and a tennis stadium which can accommodate up to 2,200 spectators. There are four tennis courts, , squash courts, billiards table, two volley ball courts and two basketball courts among other sports facilities. The athletic arena has facilities for all events like 400 m athletic tracks, javelin, shot put, triple jump, long jump, high jump, hammer throw etc. There is also a practice track of 200m where athletes can hone their skills. The stadium has a jogging track of 2km with exercise station at specific distances. Besides, ample green cover has been provided by planting large trees as well as shrubs at strategic points.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/greater-noida-fresh-tender-floated-to-hire-coaches-for-sports-complex-101638122602163.html
28-11-2021||Lucknow||Prayagraj police arrest suspect, claim cracking murders of four of a family||Prayagraj police have arrested a suspect with strong circumstantial evidence against him indicating his involvement in the gruesome murders of four members of a family, including a woman who was also raped, at Mohanganj Gohri village earlier this week.The bodies of a 47-year-old man, his 45-year-old wife, their 25-year-old daughter and 10-year-old differently able son were found at their house in the village on Thursday (November 25) morning. In connection with the crime, an FIR was lodged against 11 people of whom 8 were arrested by police on November 26.The 23-year-old suspect Pawan Saroj used to stalk the woman and would send her messages on Whatsapp. “The victims and the suspect belong to same caste and prima facie it appears that one sided love affair was the reason behind the gruesome killings and rape with the woman,” police officials said at a press conference here on Sunday. However, the police officials maintained that the suspect was still to be questioned about his accomplices and the sequence of events.Addressing media persons, ADG zone Prem Prakash said scanning of murdered 25-year-old woman’s WhatsApp messages revealed that she was receiving messages from a number that was traced to be of one Pawan Kumar Saroj, a labourer. As per the police, the last message that Pawan sent to the woman on November 21 was “I Love You” in reply to which the woman sent “I Hate You”. After his arrest, Pawan tried to mislead the police but later confessed that he had been sending messages to the woman since September 18 with his love proposals which were continuously rejected by her.While the woman had deleted her chats, the messages sent by Pawan were found in his mobile. Circumstantial evidence indicates that Pawan committed the murder with the help of his accomplices as he was enraged over being rejected by the woman. The forensic team found blood spots on Pawan’s shirt.“Moreover, Pawan stopped sending messages to the woman after her family and she were murdered. Now the police will take Pawan’s remand of Pawan to question him about his other accomplices involved in the murders and will take his DNA sample to match it with vaginal swab of the raped woman and bite marks found on her body. Investigations also revealed that Pawan lived at some distance from the house of the victims and was a regular visitor to a nearby brick kiln”, ADG added.He also said the arrested accused, who were named in the FIR, had denied their involvement in the murders. “The named accused were locked in a dispute with the brother of the murdered person and his family and no evidence has been found which could establish their involvement in the murders. However, their DNA samples will also be taken for matching them with the vaginal swab preserved for detailed examination,” the ADG said.
28-11-2021||Noida||Better safety at ₹150: Greater Noida housing complex gets automatic boom barriers||The residents welfare association (RWA) of Greater Noida’s Sector 36 on Sunday installed two automatic boom barriers using radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags at two entry gates of the sector for safety purposes, said officials.This system works similar to the FASTag installed at different expressways and highways, which helps the residents in navigating without stopping at entry or exit gates if their vehicles bear a valid tag. FASTag is a device that employs RFID technology for making toll payments directly while the vehicle is in motion. FASTag (RFID Tag) is affixed on the windscreen of the vehicle and enables a customer to make the toll payments directly from the account which is linked to FASTag.Jeet Singh, president of Sector 36 RWA, said that there are nearly 1,750 houses in the residential complex. “People have been living in the housing complex for over 10 years. There are four entry gates and two of those are operational for the movement of the people. We found that there have been some instances where unwanted elements committed crimes and later escaped. So, the RWA has decided to install two automatic boom barriers at gate numbers 1 and 4 to keep a watch,” he said.Singh also said that residents will have to provide a copy of their identity card, like Aadhaar card or voter ID, for registering themselves for this facility. “A tag will be given to a resident for ₹150 after his/her details are fed in the system, which he/she will paste on the car’s windshield glass. Cameras installed near the gates will read the tag and the boom barrier will automatically lift when the tagged car reaches near the barrier,” he said.“The boom barrier will not open if an outsider, like a guest or a delivery boy, tries to enter the housing complex. Security guards will question them and verify their credentials before allowing them entry into the housing complex. This will surely improve the safety of the residents,” Singh said, adding that 11 security guards in the residential complex look after the security and safety of the residents 24X7.The inaugural event of the automatic boom barriers at the Sector 36 housing complex on Sunday was attended by Greater Noida additional deputy commissioner of police Vishal Pandey, and station house officer (SHO) of Sector Beta 2 police station Anil Kumar.Kumar said that some theft cases have been reported from the neighbouring residential complexes in the past few months. “The Sector 36 RWA has taken this initiative to improve the safety of the residents. If this works well, we will urge other housing complexes, too, to implement similar facilities,” he said, adding that records of visitors and camera footage will help in investigating any unwanted incident, if that happens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/better-safety-at-150-greater-noida-housing-complex-gets-automatic-boom-barriers-101638122303579.html

The health department is keeping a tab on people returning to Noida and Greater Noida from abroad and conducting Covid-19 tests on them.At present, there are 16 active cases in the district, with three fresh cases and one discharge reported in the past 24 hours, till Saturday evening. Total 467 deaths have been reported, and 62,930 people have been cured in Gautam Budh Nagar since its outbreak in March 2020.Dr Sunil Sharma, chief medical officer (CMO), Gautam Budh Nagar, said that the Omicron variant -- which has a high infection rate -- is a matter of concern . “We held two video conference meetings on Saturday from the health department office in Lucknow. The district administration also held a meeting about the preparedness to tackle this new variant. Doctors and medical staff have been sensitised, and put on alert. We are awaiting a detailed guideline from Lucknow by Monday,” Sharma said.‘No cases of new variant in district/state yet, but a matter of concern’The Omicron variant, identified first in South Africa on November 24 (on Wednesday), and later detected in Europe and Asia, is raising concern among the people, given the number of about 30 mutations. The district health department said “no Covid-19 case of this variant has been reported in Gautam Budh Nagar or in Uttar Pradesh so far”.Sharma said that several Noida residents have recently returned from abroad trips. “Some foreign nationals have also visited Noida recently. The new variant may spread through these people... The health department will put such people on surveillance, and Covid tests will be conducted on them if they develop symptoms for the same. If a person tests Covid positive, the patient’s test for Omicron variant will also be performed,” he added.Alok Singh, a resident of Greater Noida’s Sector Alpha 1, said that the new Covid-19 variant is creating a psychological and emotional impact on the people. “Normalcy was returning in most of the places, and businesses were also almost resuming. However, these new variants have started creating an uncertain fear among the people... like what would happen if restrictions are imposed again,” Singh said.Dr NK Sharma, former president of India Medical Association (IMA), Noida chapter, said that people should continue to maintain social distance, wash hands on regular intervals, and restrict their movement to prevent the spread of the virus. “People should not go to markets or public places unnecessarily. We can beat this problem only if we make suitable changes in our lifestyle,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gautam-budh-nagar-on-alert-after-detection-of-new-covid-19-variant-omicron-101638122241663.html
28-11-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad: Residents protest to press demand for opening national highway 9||Hundreds of residents in Indirapuram staged a protest adjacent to national highway 9 on Sunday and demanded that the Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway, which has been shut for about a year due to the farmers’ protest, be opened for movement of vehicles. Police said the protestors wanted to form a human chain opposite to the farmers’ protest site at the UP Gate but were not granted permission for the same. Residents of many high-rises gathered near Amrapali Village high-rise, about 2km from the farmers’ protest site, with placards that bore requests to farmers to clear up the carriageway and ease commuting for thousands of commuters. Police officers and personnel prevented the protestors from venturing anywhere near the farmers’ protest site. The carriageway and the UP Gate area have been occupied by farmers, who are camping here in tents since November 28 last year, to press their demand for the rollback of the three farm laws and a new law on minimum support price (MSP). Despite Prime Minister Narendra Modi announcing on November 19 that the three farm laws will be repealed, farmers have refused to withdraw from the protest site. Farmer leaders have reiterated that the farm protests will continue till the government came out with a new law on MSP and fulfil their other demands that they have listed in an open letter written to the PM. “People are fed up with the developments. It seems that farmer protests will continue and it will again prolong opening of the road. Every authority in the country knows about the issues commuters face due to road closure but no one is doing anything,” said Alok Kumar, founder member of Federation of Association of Apartment Owners. “The police stopped us from moving near the farmers’ protest site but the day is not far when more citizens will try to move there given the problems they are facing due to road closure. We demand that the authorities open at least one lane between Ghaziabad and Delhi so that commuting becomes easy,” he added. “It has been a troublesome one year. Due to road closure, commuters are left with no choice but to start about 40-45 minutes early from their homes to reach their offices on time. Even students and those going to hospitals in Delhi face issues while commuting. For the past one year, commuters are having to bypass the UP Gate and forced to use the Hindon canal road, Kaushambi border or Noida’s Sector 62 area to reach Delhi,” said Deepak Kumar, president of Amrapali Village apartment owners’ association. “The issue is between the government and the farmers but common man is suffering due to no fault of theirs. No one is listening to the plight,” he added. Protesters also submitted a memorandum to the police and demanded immediate opening of the road. In the memorandum, residents said the highway is the lifeline for commuters and thousands of them from different localities such as Kaushambi, Indirapuram, Vaishali, Vasundhara, Raj Nagar Extension and Khoda among others, have been affected. According to official estimates, about 60,000 passenger car units ply on the UP Gate stretch per day. “The protesters submitted a memorandum, which will be forwarded to the respective authorities. We did not allow them to proceed near the UP Gate area as it may have caused law and order problems,” said Gyanendra Kumar Singh, superintendent of police (city 2). Farmer leaders said they have their sympathies for the residents who are facing so many issues while commuting. “The government is to blame for all the issues both farmers and the commuters are facing. Residents should forward their demand to the government. We also want speedy resolution of issues faced by farmers so that every farmer goes back home happily,” said Jagtar Singh Bajwa, a farmer leader and a spokesperson of Samyukta Kisan Morcha-- an umbrella body of different farmer unions--at the UP Gate site.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-residents-protest-to-press-demand-for-opening-national-highway-9-101638122181748.html
28-11-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab CM Channi says will do PhD on Mahabharata||Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Sunday said he will learn Sanskrit and do a doctorate on the Mahabharata as he announced to set up a research centre on the Hindu texts Ramayana, Mahabharata and Bhagvad Gita.Addressing after laying the foundation stone of a Bhagwan Parshuram Taposthal here, he also compared SAD patriarch Parkash Singh Badal to Mahabharata’s Dhritarashtra, saying the "putra moh" (blind love) for his son has led to the "ruin" of his party.The CM said the research centre will showcase the message of the three Hindu texts.Since ages, these texts have been a source of inspiration for the entire humanity and the research centre will act as a catalyst for disseminating the message of these among the masses in the simplest form, he said.Channi said his government is trying to rope in a respected Shankracharya for this ambitious project.Striking an emotional chord with the Brahmin community, he said they have strong ties with him.Channi said he will learn Sanskrit language and then do a doctorate on the Mahabharata."I was told by a very wise and scholarly man to learn one shloka of the Bhagavad Gita every day to make my life meaningful and righteous. The Gita updesh is unparalleled. My present PhD will be completed in three months. Then I will start learning Sanskrit and do a PhD on the Mahabharata," he added.The chief minister further said to ensure proper care of stray cattle in the state, the Brahmin Welfare Board will be entrusted with this task.He said funds will be provided to the board for proper upkeep of the stray cattle.It is the need of hour to solve this one of the major social problems, he said.The CM also said his government will develop the "taposthal" of Bhagwan Parshuram as a state-of-the-art architectural marvel.A cheque for ₹10 crore has already been handed over to the district administration and more funds whenever needed will be sent accordingly, Channi added.Channi said ₹75 lakh will be spent on the development of a place related to Mata Renuka, the mother of Lord Parshuram.Evoking the example of the Mahabharata to make a scathing attack on the Akalis, the CM said the "Kauravas" were ruined due to "putra moh" of King Dhritarashtra.In the same manner, he said that Akalis are in shambles due to the "love" of Akali stalwart Parkash Singh Badal for his son.Channi said the Mahabharata is a treatise regarding statecraft and is still relevant today," adding the "poor situation" of the Akali Dal is an example of it.Slamming Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal for "little knowledge" about the state, Channi said the Delhi CM is "groping in the dark for fulfilling his lust for power".He said besides being an outsider, Kejriwal is a "rumour monger", who knows nothing about the state but pokes his nose into everything.He said such type of "cheap" politics will never be successful in the state.The chief minister said he was fortunate that the Congress leadership has bestowed him this service to serve the state.Paying tributes to Lord Parshuram, the chief minister exhorted people to imbibe the ideals propagated by him so that justice and equality is ensured in society.He said that Bhagwan Parshuram stood for protecting the basic tenets of religion, truth, universal love, compassion and righteousness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-cm-channi-says-will-do-phd-on-mahabharata-101638121821120.html
28-11-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram: Builder fined ₹25 lakh for violating construction ban norm||The Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) on Sunday imposed a penalty of ₹25 lakh on Mahira Developers for carrying out construction activities--in violation of the ban imposed by the Supreme Court and the directions issued by the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM)--at its project site in Gurugram’s Sector 103 on the intervening night of Saturday and Sunday. “During an inspection at night, a team from the pollution board found construction taking place at the site of Mahira Buildtech Pvt Ltd at Daultabad in Sector 103. Construction activities were immediately stopped and environmental compensation penalty of ₹25 lakh was imposed on the developer. Likewise, another violator was penalised for operating a diesel generator set on Railway Road,” said Kuldip Singh, regional officer (north), HSPCB. Rajesh Kumar, incharge of construction at Mahira Developers, said only those activities were being carried out at the project site that were permitted by the authorities. “There seems to be some confusion as we are adhering to norms. We will take up the matter with the pollution department,” he said. The state pollution board has been quick in issuing challans to large contractors and industry owners for violating pollution norms after the Supreme Court passed directions to take measures to curb pollution in the NCR districts. In the last two days, the board has issued challans on highway contractors and industry owners for not taking enough measures to control air pollution. Meanwhile, the air quality in the city continued to remain in the ‘very poor’ category for the fifth consecutive day on Sunday with Gurugram recording an AQI of 372. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.The air monitoring station at Gwal Pahari recorded an AQI 370, Sector 51 recorded AQI 384, Teri Gram recorded AQI 384 AQI while Vikas Sadan recorded AQI 361. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) recorded a maximum temperature of 24.7 degrees Celsius and a minimum of 10.5°C. The IMD on Sunday said the air quality over Delhi-NCR is likely to remain in the upper end of ‘very poor’ category as mostly calm or slow winds during evening and night are unfavourable for effective dispersion of pollutants. “Winds are likely to be relatively strong from Monday and Tuesday, which will slightly improve air quality but will remain in the very poor category on both days,” said the IMD. Low wind speed and drop in temperatures kept pollutants trapped in the lower layers of the atmosphere and prevented effective dispersion of particulate matter. Sachin Panwar, a city-based air quality expert, said this is one of the worst phases of pollution in the city as mixing height is very low and all pollutants are stuck in the lower atmosphere. “Dispersion by local factors is very low as of now; strict Grap measures are required to reduce local emissions. School timings should be changed.. Senior citizens and those having respiratory complications should take extra precaution,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-builder-fined-25-lakh-for-violating-construction-ban-norm-101638121761617.html
28-11-2021||Mumbai||Seven-day quarantine for South African passengers likely||Maharashtra is likely to announce seven-day institutional quarantine for all passengers flying from or transiting through South Africa. It is also likely to make a negative RT-PCR test mandatory for domestic travellers entering Maharashtra, according to senior state officials. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday, in a review meeting with the district collectors and municipal commissioners, said they could go ahead with immediate imposition of quarantine rules without waiting for the Centre to announce new guidelines. Thackeray chaired the meeting from a Mumbai hospital where he is recuperating, following a spine surgery. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had sought 14-day institutional quarantine from passengers coming from geographies of concern in Africa. However, the state is expected to approve seven-day quarantine. Detailed guidelines are expected to be issued in a couple of days, officials said. “A large number of people from abroad have started coming to Mumbai and other places. Many of them land elsewhere in the country and travel by domestic airlines, roads and trains. If any of them are carriers of the virus, others may be at great risk, so it is imperative to investigate such passengers, to keep a tab on them,” Thackeray is quoted in a statement released by his office. During the meeting, Thackeray instructed officials to conduct tests of international and domestic passengers arriving at airports. “Necessary steps should be taken immediately by taking the required decisions without waiting for Centre’s instructions,” said Thackeray. State Covid Task Force member Dr Shashank Joshi said that they are now in “vigilant” mode as the new variant – B.1.1.529 – is reportedly more infectious than Delta, a variant that was largely responsible for the deadly second wave of coronavirus infections in India earlier this year. Joshi, who attended the meeting on Sunday, said, “The Delta variant had two mutations, this has over 50. It is a super mutant, and it transmits rapidly. In 10 days, it replaced the dominant Delta strain in South Africa.” He added, “If you look at the mutation sites, it is likely to cause more severe disease. In the next four weeks, we will have data to understand how severe it is. India is concerned because this new variant can replace Delta. If a new strain comes into India now, we might get a new wave through this strain.” He added that the vaccination drive needs to be faster, and people who have not taken their second dose must not delay, if they have completed the mandatory 84-day period. Meanwhile, on Sunday, Maharashtra added 832 new cases (6,634,444 cumulative). The state also reported 33 deaths to take the toll to 140,941. Mumbai added 210 new infections (762,584 cumulative) and four fatalities (toll 16,330). The active cases in the state were 8,193, while Mumbai has 2192 active cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sevenday-quarantine-for-south-african-passengers-likely-101638121161675.html
28-11-2021||Mumbai||Special traffic chowkies at rail terminals to deal with unscrupulous auto, taxi drivers||Passengers arriving at Mumbai’s major railway terminals would now have recourse to a special traffic department of the Government Railway Police (GRP), which has been restarted after 12 years, to deal with unscrupulous autorickshaw and taxi drivers who refuse their fare or overcharge them.A circular issued by the Mumbai Government Railway Police commissioner on November 17 stated that each of the city’s five major terminals, where long distance trains halt, will have a chowkie (station) with a sanctioned strength of 12 officers and 10 constables to deal with passenger complaints against errant drivers. These chowkies will come up at Bandra, Kurla LTT, Mumbai Central, and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus and Dadar stations, where one officer of Assistant Police Inspector level and two constables will be present at all times. Drivers flouting rules would be penalised under the Motor Vehicles Act 1988. The headquarters for the traffic wing of the GRP will be stationed at Dadar station, between platforms 5 and 6 (Central line) where most long-distance trains halt.“At present we are conducting awareness drives to alert the drivers about the new department who would be keeping a check on them,” GRP commissioner Quaiser Khalid said.For 55-year-old theatre actor Radheshyam Sharma, a resident of Vikhroli, who travels on express trains once a week, this was good news. “Every time I get off a train, I take a deep breath as I know there would be at least 20 rickshaw or taxi drivers who will refuse a fare to Vikhroli or demand four times the actual fare. Dragging my luggage across the parking lots and convincing an auto or taxi driver to drop me home takes me at least two hours,” Sharma said.Mulund resident Madhu Kotian recalled a similar experience after he returned with his family from a vacation in Goa. After they got off at Bandra, they took an auto home. However, the driver overcharged them for the ride, the 64-year-old said. “Unaware I am a Mumbai resident, the auto driver took me through longer routes and was roaming in circles around Bandra East just to extract more money from me. I didn’t say a word and let him drive. When I reached Mulund after more than two hours, he asked me to pay ₹500,” said Kotian.“The mafia of these drivers is so strong outside the Terminals that that they don’t even allow Ola or Uber cabs to enter the premises blocking their way by parking haphazardly especially at odd hours when local trains are shut,” said Shashi Parekar, a Vasai resident. The 61-year-old said that he has given in to the demands of drivers who have asked for twice the money to take him home. “Many times, I have paid according to the taxi driver’s demand as I had no choice but to reach Vasai safely,” he said.There are at least 50 to 60 taxis parked outside the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) at any given point of time. At Mumbai Central — where more than 30 outstation trains are either entering or leaving the station in a day — hundreds of passengers disembark from each train. At Dadar, over 31 trains bring more than 50,000 commuters every day [CONFIRM] to the station. At least 52 trains halt at Kurla Lokmanya Tilak terminus where more than 150,000 passengers alight and board the trains daily. Commuters across all these terminals said that they are often refused a ride because drivers prefer to take passengers who travel to the outskirts. Many commuters complained that “a mafia” overcharged passengers, asking for fare that was several times higher than what the metres permitted.At Bandra terminus, where more than 40 express trains halt in a day, the footfall is 50,000 passengers daily.“Just like the system at the airport, we are now organising travel for commuters who have already travelled long distances and just want to reach their home without hassle,” said Police Inspector Suresh Bhale, in charge of the traffic division of the GRP.“Drunk drivers will be presented before the court if we get any complaints from passengers,” Bhale said. Rash and negligent drivers would also be penalised with fines varying from ₹200 to ₹2000.When contacted AL Quadros, leader of Taxi Union said that the drivers are following the rules but it becomes difficult to follow the five minute rule (taxi or auto drivers can stop inside the premises to drop a passenger onky for five minutes) as the passengers have heavy luggage or even struggle for change at times. “We will surely oppose if the GRP traffic too flows this rule,” said Quadros.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/special-traffic-chowkies-at-rail-terminals-to-deal-with-unscrupulous-auto-taxi-drivers-101638120261510.html
28-11-2021||Mumbai||DRI seizes iPhone 13 worth ₹43 crore at Mumbai airport||Mumbai: The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) seized 3,646 iPhone 13 models worth ₹42.86 crore at Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport. The items arrived from Hong Kong declaring the goods as memory cards to smuggle them in India.According to the press release issued by the agency, “The consignments had come from Hong Kong at the air cargo complex at Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport, Mumbai. The sender declared the goods as ‘memory cards’ in the import documents but during a physical examination, it was revealed the actual consignment contained iPhones.”The iPhone 13 models went for sale in India from September 2021 onwards, with a base price of ₹70,000 and some of the higher-end models costing up to ₹1,80,000. Import of mobile phones into India attracts effective Customs Duty of around 44%, said a DRI official. The detection of attempted smuggling of these high-end phones of the latest models in such large numbers shows how quickly the smugglers establish their smuggling networks for the latest products, like iPhone 13. This detection has helped unearth a serious import fraud, reinforcing DRI’s ability to detect and combat unique and sophisticated methods of smuggling, having substantial revenue implications, mentioned in the release.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/dri-seizes-iphone-13-worth-43-crore-at-mumbai-airport-101638119601540.html
28-11-2021||Mumbai||Bring law that guarantees MSP, says Tikait; warns of protest on Republic Day||Farmers’ leader, who represents Bharat Kisan Union, Rakesh Tikait on Sunday warned of a major protest on Republic Day if the Central government does not hold talks with them and bring a law that will guarantee minimum support price (MSP) for the farm produce. Slamming the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government, he said the farmers will not go back to their homes until they will speak to them. Tikait was talking to reporters in Mumbai during a ‘mahapanchayat’ held by the farmers outfits to celebrate the historic victory of the year-long farmers’ struggle against contentious three farm laws and to declare the determination to fight for the remaining demands that include MSP, financial compensation to the families of the farmers who lost their lives during the agitation and withdrawal of criminal cases against the protestors among others. According to the Samyukta Kisan Morcha, a coalition of over 40 farmers’ outfits, that is leading the agitation, around 750 farmers died while protesting against the farm laws in the past one year. “The farmers will not tolerate this bullying anymore. We have tolerated enough. Bring the MSP guarantee law, otherwise, January 26 is not too far and four lakh tractors and farmers are all present,” Tikait told reporters. “We need to be careful from this (BJP-led) government. They are yet to start discussion with us. This government is backstabber, conspiratorial, dishonest and is still trying to humiliate the farm community and end our agitation… Farmers will not be returning back to their homes until the government will talk to us. Repealing the three laws does not mean that our problems have to come to an end. There are many issues farmers are facing and one of them is MSP,” he said, while addressing the ‘mahapanchayat’ at Azad Maidan in Mumbai. After concluding the mahapanchayat, farmers’ leaders immersed the ashes of the farmers who were killed in Lakhimpur Kheri in Uttar Pradesh, in the Arabian Sea. The ashes were taken to most of the districts of the state to remind the agrarian community about the treatment given to them by the Central government. Four cultivators were mowed down by a SUV during a protest that triggered the violence in Lakhimpur Kheri on October 3. The farmers have claimed Ashish Mishra, son of Ajay Mishra, Union minister of state for home, was driving the vehicle that killed the farmers. Mishra was arrested as a prime accused in the case. Targeting the Prime Minister, Tikait said, “They don’t want to give us MSP because they want to loot the farmers and fill the godowns of the industrialists,” he alleged. He also said PM Modi was a supporter of the MSP when he was the chief minister of Gujarat and wanted a nationwide law to ensure that MSP is guaranteed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bring-law-that-guarantees-msp-says-tikait-warns-of-protest-on-republic-day-101638118521445.html
28-11-2021||Lucknow||Three Europeans test Covid positive in Vrindavan||Three Europeans have tested positive for Covid-19 in the pilgrim town Vrindavan since Friday, a health official said on Sunday.A woman from Lithuania was the first to be found infected with Covid-19 there. Two Spain and Switzerland nationals have also tested positive now.All three had reached India on or around November 15 and were at the same Vrindavan ashram, which has now been declared a containment zone. Their samples are being sent to Lucknow for genome sequencing, the official said, adding that samples of 44 others who were in contact with them at ashram are being tested.“Earlier, a woman from the Republic of Lithuania, aged about 30 years, had tested positive for Covid-19. She arrived in India on November 15 for travel purposes and was staying at Girdhar Dham, Sheetal Chayya Mandir in Vrindavan. She tested positive on Friday. Samples of those coming in her contact, mainly foreigners, at the ashram were subjected to testing,” said Dr Bhoodev, the deputy chief medical officer (deputy CMO) at Mathura. Vrindavan is in Mathura district of western Uttar Pradesh.“A woman from Spain, aged 47 years, and a man from Switzerland, aged 44 years, also tested positive at the same ashram. They were also in India since the last fortnight,” the deputy CMO said.“Today, it was revealed that the man from Switzerland, who tested positive for Covid-19, has already moved away from the ashram and is being traced,” he stated. “Samples of 44 others from the ashram are being taken and sent for testing as they are feared to have come in contact with those testing positive. Samples of these three foreigners are being sent to Lucknow for genome sequencing to ascertain the variant,” Dr Bhoodev further said.Vrindavan, about 150 kilometres from Delhi, is among the favourite destinations for Krishna devotees from abroad as it is dotted with a series of Krishna temples and ashrams. The health department has made arrangements for sample testing of these devotees arriving from overseas.On November 20, a footwear manufacturer from Agra tested positive for Covid after returning from Poland. But 50 others at his shoe factory tested negative. The samples of the footwear manufacturer have been sent to Lucknow for genome sequencing and the reports are awaited, said Agra chief medical officer Dr AK Srivastava.The first Covid positive case in Uttar Pradesh had been reported from Agra on March 2, 2020. That patient had returned from Italy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/three-europeans-test-covid-positive-in-vrindavan-101638118461435.html

Sharing the pictures of his visit, Channi said children playing near his helicopter made him reminisce of his childhood days when he, too, used to see planes wishing that he would one day get a chance to sit in it.“During my visit to Morinda, saw children playing near the helicopter. When I was young, I used to see planes & think that one day I too would get a chance to sit in it. Reminiscing about the same, I made a few village children fly with me in helicopter & fulfilled their dream,” Channi tweeted.The Congress leader posted three pictures of his Morinda visit, one of them showing the chopper in the air with children aboard. After interacting with the children, Channi said, he felt there was no dearth of talent in Punjab but added that they need proper guidance. He promised he will do his best to create a bright future for all the children of Punjab.“While interacting with them, I felt that there was no dearth of talent in Punjab, but there is a need to give proper guidance to these children.

28-11-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab govt to set up research centre on Hindu epics, says CM Channi||Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Sunday announced to set up an exclusive state-of-the-art research centre on the epics of Ramayana, Mahabharata and Bhagavad Gita. Addressing a gathering after laying the foundation stone of state-of-the-art Bhagwan Parshuram Taposthal in Phagwara, the CM said the upcoming centre will showcase the message of the three epics. He said since ages these epics have been source of life and inspiration for the humanity and this research centre will act as a catalyst for disseminating their message among the masses. “The state government is trying to rope in Shankaracharya ji for this ambitious project. We will develop the Bhagwan Parshuram Taposthan as an architectural marvel. A cheque of ₹10 crore has already been handed over the district administration and more funds will be sent,” he added. Tthe Brahmin Welfare Board will be entrusted with ensuring proper care of the stray cattle in the state, the CM said.Citing the example of Mahabharata while taking a jibe at the Akalis, Channi said that the Kauravas were ruined due to king Dhritrashtra’s putra moh (love for son). “Similarly, the Akali Dal is in a mess due to the love of party stalwart Parkash Singh Badal for his son. The Mahabharata is a treatise on statecraft and is still relevant today. The state of affairs in the Akali Dal is an example of it,” he claimed. Terming Aam Aadmi Party national convener Arvind Kejriwal as a rumour-monger, Channi said his Delhi counterpart knew nothing about Punjab but kept poking his nose into everything. Channi announced a budgetary provision worth ₹2 crore for Bhagwan Parshuram Chair at Punjabi University, Patiala. Cabinet minister Rana Gurjit Singh said that CM Channi represents the secular ideology of Congress. “He has taken path-breaking initiatives for the well-being of all communities,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-govt-to-set-up-research-centre-on-hindu-epics-says-cmchanni-101638117801583.html
28-11-2021||Pune||Pune: CNG pumps shut due to repair work on pipeline sees auto drivers stuck in long queues||PUNE The sudden closure of CNG pumps in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad on Saturday caused trouble to auto rickshaw drivers and other CNG vehicle owners. The sudden closure was caused due to the repair work of the gas pipeline providing CNG to Pune by the Gas Authority of India Limited (GAIL). The pumps were reopened on Sunday morning and auto rickshaw drivers were seen making a beeline at the CNG station. “On Saturday morning I went to the CNG pump at Katraj but it was closed. I had to shut my business as no notice was provided beforehand. Now today, I had to wait for more than an hour in the queue to fill the CNG gas due to the rush,” said Mahesh Raut an auto driver. There are around 90 CNG pumps in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad, of which 50 were closed due to the repair and cleaning work of the pipelines. “The pressure of the CNG supply to the pumps was reduced, due to which most of the CNG pumps remained closed on Saturday. But now all the CNG pumps have resumed back normally. As such an incident has happened for the first time in Pune, many auto and car drivers had to face inconvenience and we will take care of it in future,” said Rajesh Pande, MNGL independent director.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-cng-pumps-shut-due-to-repair-work-on-pipeline-sees-auto-drivers-stuck-in-long-queues-101638117141545.html
28-11-2021||Mumbai||Portion of 400-year-old church to make way for road-widening project||The portion of 400-year-old St. Anthony’s Church, popularly known as Malvani Church among the locals is set to make way for a road widening project of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). The church serves more than 15,000 parishioners. Makarand Dagadkhair, assistant municipal commissioner said that a total of 22 structures are being affected for this project, of which two structures are within the premises of this church. “Structures within the premises of the church that have been given a heritage tag, will not be touched. Only the compound wall will be taken down and the portion of the bungalow, in which, the priest resides will be affected,” Dagadkhair said. According to Father Angelo Fernandez, the church and the administrative building within its premises have been identified as a Grade-2 heritage structure by the Mumbai Heritage Conservation Committee (MHCC). He said some portions of the church were rebuilt in 1872 and the origin of the church is more than 400 years old. In order to widen the one kilometre stretch of the existing Marve Road, the P/North (P/N) office of the BMC had issued a notice to the church authorities earlier this year. Earlier this week, representatives of the church held a meeting with the BMC officials and gave their consent to the project. However, the locals have opposed the project. According to the officials the existing width of the road is around 40 feet and the BMC intends to widen it to 60 feet. Dagadkhair said that in return, the BMC will be providing the church financial compensation, based on the present day ready-reckoner rates. “This issue has been delayed for more than 40 years now. Due to this, various development works are getting delayed. The road needs to be widened at the earliest because there is traffic congestion regularly,” Dagadkhair. Meanwhile, Father Fernandez said that the church has given up the land in the larger interest of the people. “We have given 20 feet of our premises to the BMC and have also compromised on the rate that we are getting. We have given them a go-ahead in the larger interest of the people,” he said. He also said that during festivals and mass offerings, the area gets so crowded that devotees often pray from outside the church. “In future, our parishioners will face sheer inconvenience as the proposed road will pass adjoining the main church building and there will be no space for them to stand outside the church,” said the father. He also claimed that the church is a heritage precinct and that the civic body needs to take special permission from the MHCC before starting work. A senior official from the BMC heritage department said that special permission will not be necessary as the project involves the compound wall and it doesn’t directly affect the heritage structures present over there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/portion-of-400-year-old-church-to-make-way-for-road-widening-project-101638115281277.html
28-11-2021||Mumbai||BMC to trace travellers who arrived from ‘countries of concern’ in last 2 weeks||Mumbai Concerned about the outbreak of the Omicron variant, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided to trace travellers who arrived in Mumbai from ‘countries of concern’ in the last two weeks. The BMC has said that they have sourced such data from authorities at Mumbai airport and are now starting to trace such passengers and test them for the new variant.The BMC had issued an advisory requesting citizens to take more precautions on Saturday. The BMC said that all international passengers arriving at the city’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) from ‘countries of concern’ including countries from Africa, would be made to undergo mandatory RT-PCR testing for Covid-19, and if found positive, would be sent to an institutional quarantine centre.The BMC had also said that the travel history of all international passengers would be verified through their passports on arrival. However, in all this, the BMC officials have said that tracing and testing those passengers who have already arrived in the city also becomes crucial.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner of the BMC said, “We have collected information regarding tracing passengers who have arrived from countries of concern in the past two weeks from the airport and are segregating it district-wise. We are going to test such passengers and ask them to follow home quarantine regulations.”However, if any of the passengers who have arrived from the countries of concern tests positive, they will be subjected to institutional quarantine and their samples will be sent for genome sequencing. According to BMC, countries of concern include South Africa, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Mozambique apart from some Middle Eastern and European countries.However, experts have said that citizens do not need to panic but continue following Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. Dr Madhav Sathe, former microbiologist at Nair Hospital, said, “We do not need to panic for now but continue following Covid-appropriate behaviour irrespective of the spread. Whether Omicron will have any Impact in India or not, but one good thing that is going to happen is that the public will be more cautious.”Dr Sathe added, “South African Medical Association has stated that the Omicron variant of Covid-19 causes mild infection with two to three days of muscle pain, tiredness and mild cough. These cases were seen more in unvaccinated people, and there has not been any rise in hospitalised patients. Hence, we do not need to panic but remain vigilant.”Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of Maharashtra State Covid-19 task force, took to Twitter and said, “Nothing to worry about. Just be alert vigilant and follow all guidelines.”Meanwhile, on Sunday, 210 cases were reported in the city followed by four deaths taking the tally to 762,584 and toll to 16,330. The city’s recovery rate is 97% and there are 741,515 recoveries in the city. The mortality rate in the city is 2.14% and there are 2,192 active cases in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-to-trace-travellers-who-arrived-from-countries-of-concern-in-last-2-weeks-101638114321349.html
28-11-2021||Chandigarh||Op Bluestar ₹1,000 crore damage suit: Fearing backlash, SGPC changes tack on out-of-court settlement with Centre||Apprehending a strong reaction from the Sikh community, the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) has decided not to go for an out-of-court settlement with the central government in the case of ₹1,000-crore damage suit related to Operation Bluestar.The SGPC has instead decided to resume the legal battle in the lawsuit that was filed in the Delhi high court in March 1985 during the tenure of then gurdwara body president Gurcharan Singh Tohra. On the court’s order, both sides — the Centre and SGPC — were ready to resolve the dispute out of court in 2019, even as no meeting has been held in this regard so far. The decision to comply with the court was taken during the tenure of then chief Gobind Singh Longowal.The current office-bearers were also thinking to take forward the decision, but some Sikh sections disapproved of the move after the matter became public through media reports. “A sub-committee constituted to work on the legal aspects of the case has not submitted its report yet. We told them (committee) that we are going to contest the case,” said SGPC president Jagir Kaur while speaking to HT.The SGPC represents the community and is answerable to it, she said, adding, “We will not strike any compromise till the central government is put in the dock and is held guilty by the judiciary.” The sub-committee has also been asked to prepare a list of valuable items allegedly taken away by the army from the Sikh Reference Library and other places in the Golden Temple complex.The military action carried out in June 1984 to flush Sikh militants out from the Golden Temple had damaged the buildings of the Akal Takht and Teja Singh Samundri Hall, the SGPC headquarters, besides the main shrine complex.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/op-bluestar-rs-1-000-crore-damage-suit-fearing-backlash-sgpc-changes-tack-on-out-of-court-settlement-with-centre-101638114201160.html

Paper leaks, cancellation of examination and results are common in the BJP regime. UP is at the peak of corruption in education sector. There will be a change for unemployed youth in 2022.”In a tweet, Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati said the cancellation of UPTET for the recruitment of teachers in Uttar Pradesh is a very serious matter.“The UP government should take this latest incident very seriously and get a high level inquiry done at the earliest and ensure strict legal punishment to the culprits. The government should ensure a solid system to conduct this examination as soon as possible,” Mayawati added.Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said, “Due to UPTET question paper leak, the hard work of lakhs of candidates got ruined. Every time the question paper got out, Yogi Adityanath’s government saved the big fish involved in corruption.”Rashtriya Lok Dal chief Jayant Chaudhary, in a tweet, said, “This is a stupid joke with lakhs of hardworking students. The youth of Uttar Pradesh is fed up with paper leak.”Bhim Army chief Chandra Shekhar Azad tweeted, “Around 21 lakh candidates had reached hundreds of kilometres away in cold to take the exam. Who will take responsibility for the inconvenience caused to candidates? First, there aren’t enough vacancies and if it all there are any, then question paper gets leaked. First the paper of inspector recruitment was leaked and now that of UPTET.”He also said, “It is our demand that whenever the exam is held the next time, the state government should provide adequate bus facilities so that candidates may reach exam centre without much inconvenience. The government should also make arrangements for their accommodation and food.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uptet-opposition-hits-out-at-state-government-over-paper-leak-101638114081186.html
28-11-2021||Patna||No respite from ‘very poor’ air quality in Patna, Muzaffarpur||The overall air pollution levels in Patna and Muzaffarpur remained in the ‘very poor’ category on Sunday while some observatories ringed alarm as they crossed 350-mark inching closer to the ‘severe’ air quality.Residents are unlikely to get any respite from deteriorating air quality due to a dip in temperature and wedding season, said pollution experts.According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), an overall air quality index (AQI) of Patna based on five air monitoring stations stood at 342, which was categorised under ‘very poor’.The CPCB classifies an AQI of zero to 50 as ‘good’, 51-100 as ‘satisfactory’, 101-200 as ‘moderate’, 201-300 as ‘poor’, 301-400 as ‘very poor’ and above 401 as ‘severe’.In Patna, AQI at three air-monitoring stations inched closer to the ‘severe’ category. Observatories near IGSC Planetarium Complex registered AQI at 394, Samanpura 391, Rajbansi Nagar 386 followed by Danapur 340. Shikarpur-based apparatus recorded ‘moderate’ air quality with an index value of 200.Besides, Hajipur and Muzaffarpur also recorded ‘very poor’ air quality with an index value of 326 and 313 respectively. Gaya recorded ‘poor’ air quality with an index value of 290.Meanwhile, Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) claimed that a series of steps were being taken to improve the air quality in the state, however, results will be visible in coming years.BSPCB’s chairman Ashok Ghosh said that apart from geographical location and decline in temperature, wedding season was also responsible for the spike in pollution levels.“Wedding season is at peak this year as a large number of weddings, which were postponed last year, are taking place this month involving heavy vehicular rush and firecracker bursting. They are also responsible to some extent behind the hike in air pollution levels”, he said. “Mass awareness is going on to encourage people to opt for environment-friendly steps such as switching to CNG vehicles, covering construction sites with green sheets and not burning garbage in open areas. The board has a provision to impose a fine of up to ₹25,000 on burning garbage in open areas. We have yet not penalised any individual as awareness programme is going on but soon, we would start penalising the violators for the offence”, he added.Meanwhile, Ankita Jyoti, senior programme officer at CEED, said, “We need to increase the frequency of measures such as water sprinkling in hotspot zones to reduce air pollution level. The state government has already prepared an emergency action plan for tackling air pollution but strict enforcement is needed to bring effective results.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/no-respite-from-very-poor-air-quality-in-patna-muzaffarpur-101638113721162.html

The chief minister also stressed that people who have returned from abroad should be monitored and those who have tested positive should be screened for the new variant. Kumar who also reviewed the ongoing vaccination programme against Covid-19 laid stress on accelerating the vaccination drive and directed officials to use all modes of publicity to encourage people who have taken the 1st dose to inoculate themselves with the 2nd dose as well. “There should be state level monitoring of those districts where the vaccination drive and testing is slow. There should not be any laxity on testing and vaccination drive should be widely publicised ,” the CM said. Till Sunday, Bihar has inoculated 80 million citizens, according to officials.During the meeting, Bihar representative of World Health Organisation ( WHO) Dr Subramaniyam apprised the CM about the new Covid variant ‘Omicron’ and its various aspects.

28-11-2021||Mumbai||High court stays demolition of shops for GMLR||The Bombay high court (HC) last week restrained the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) from demolishing shops at Dindoshi for the ₹6000 crore Goregaon-Mulund Link Road (GMLR) project after it was informed that the compensation that BMC offered was not adequate as per the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013. The petitioners had approached the HC after the BMC reportedly offered them a fourth of the compensation they deserved after they refused the BMC’s offer to rehabilitate them at Charkop. A division bench of Justices AA Sayed and SG Dige, while hearing the petitions of 15 of the 50 affected shopkeepers, was informed by senior advocate JP Sen along with Advocates Irani and Co that BMC had started demolishing a large number of structures bordering Gen AK Vaidya Marg in Goregaon East without following proper procedure or giving adequate compensation. The petitioners also sought directions to the BMC to follow proper procedure before undertaking any demolition work. The GMLR, aimed at connecting the arterial Western and Eastern Express Highways with two flyovers and two 4.75-km-long tunnels to be constructed 20 meters below the Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP), is expected to cost ₹6000 crore. BMC had begun demolishing structures in an attempt to start work on the flyovers by the end of 2021 and on the tunnels by mid-2022. BMC has been demolishing structures bordering Gen AK Vaidya Marg for widening the road to 150 feet as per the GMLR’s sanctioned plan. Sen, who appeared for 11 shopkeepers (the remaining four were represented by another lawyer who used the same submissions as Sen), informed the bench that though the GMLR was sanctioned in 1973, work on it began only recently, and that shops and other business establishments had come up there as the BMC had not acquired the land till then. He admitted that illegal structures had come up in that period; however, the legal structures of the petitioners and others were also targeted in BMC’s demolition drive. As they feared they will not get proper compensation for their properties, they had approached the HC. According to the shopkeepers, BMC’s compensation of ₹35-38 lakh is only a fourth of the market value. They said they refuse to accept it. BMC’s lawyer Narendra Walawalkar informed the bench that the petitioners had been offered rehabilitation at Charkop, but they had refused to accept it. It was then that the civic authority offered them compensation. As the matter was sub-judice, the civic authority said it was willing to give an undertaking that the petitioners’ properties will not be demolished till the petition is decided. The court accepted the undertaking, and directed the BMC to ensure that the grievances of the petitioners were resolved amicably. However, on November 24, the bench was informed by the petitioners that, with the exception of their shops, the BMC had demolished, without notice, 35 legal shops. Hence the aggrieved shop owners also wished to be heard. The bench was told that BMC’s lawyer Walawalkar was indisposed and could not be present. The bench, therefore, adjourned the hearing to December 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/high-court-stays-demolition-of-shops-for-gmlr-101638111681099.html
28-11-2021||Pune||Section of MSRTC staff still on strike; say it’s only way to see demands met||PUNE: Even as most state transport employees have returned to duty, a large section is still refusing to resume work demanding the merger of the Maharashtra State Regional Transport Corporation (MSRTC) with the state government – a demand that has been refused by those in power.Instead, the government last week announced an unprecedented 41% hike for workers, to placate the agitating employees. However, the staff is firm on their original demand and has not accepted the government announcement. A large section of the agitating employees backed by prominent lawyer, Gunratan Sadavarte, still believe that this is their best chance to get demands accepted by the government even as Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders, who were earlier backing the protest, have now withdrawn from it.Sadavarte, who is fighting the legal battle in the high court for the protesting employees, said, “I am very positive that the state government will soon listen to our demand. After a long time, the entire nation and even the state of Maharashtra has seen the unity of workers without any union or flag. We believe in the state, we are not radicals, and the state has to follow constitutional principles in letter and spirit. More than 40 workers committed suicide. This time, the state government should think twice.”Sunday marked the 22nd day of the strike as services at many depots were operational only partially while no buses were seen plying along some routes in the state. With a fleet of 18,500 buses and 96,000 employees, the MSRTC has been a favoured and trustworthy mode of transport for many in Maharashtra even as the corporation has suffered losses year after year. The most crucial part of the current agitation has been that the striking workers have refused to be part of any union as all unions are affiliated to some or the other political party.Sanjay Mundhe, a driver from Swargate depot, who has been suspended, said, “It’s been hard to survive so long without any union or organisation support in the strike, but now every common worker of the organisation has realised the importance of this strike and most of us have decided to fight till the end. We are firm about taking the strike forward till our major demand of merging with the state government is fulfilled.”When asked about the salary hike offer made by the state transport minister, Mundhe said, “This has already happened once with us a few years back. For the time being, the government gives a hike in salary but after the protests die down, it is revoked or adjusted without making much difference to the original payout. So we do not believe in any of their words and all the workers across the state are firm on continuing the strike.”Covid-19 pushed an already loss-ridden state transport body over the edge with MSRTC forced to raise funds. As the corporation delayed staff salaries during Covid-19 after buses were pulled off roads due to lockdowns and restrictions, some workers were forced to take extreme steps. According to the agitating MSRTC staff, around 40 of their workers committed suicide due to the Covid-induced financial crisis. Many believe that if the corporation is absorbed into the government, such a situation will not arise in future.Even after the high court (HC) intervened in the issue and called the strike “illegal”, instructing workers to resume duty, a large number of workers across the state are still reluctant to resume work. The workers believe that they are left with no option but to continue with the strike considering the financial uncertainty the corporation has been facing. They also know the government’s limitation in not being able to recruit drivers quickly without imparting proper training.Till now, the organisation has suspended over 7,800 workers from across divisions. While the MSRTC management has claimed that around 18,000 protesting workers have resumed work, most of them are from the clerical, administrative and workshop departments. The majority of drivers and conductors - who are the backbone of the ST bus service - have still not resumed work. On the other hand, the government has repeatedly made it clear that a committee appointed on the direction of the HC is looking into the demand for a merger. During an interaction with reporters last week, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar said, “I read the statement of transport minister Anil Parab that the state government will consider the recommendations of the committee seriously, so the issue of the merger is currently pending before the HC committee and I do not want to speak on that issue.” Pawar said that if the demand for the merger is accepted for these employees, it will have to be applied to the staff of other departments - who are not government employees but are associated with government services - as well. “There are 15 to 16 other departments whose staffers are not government employees, but are associated with the respective services. If we want to consider all these employees together for the merger, then perhaps, the government will have to run for such purpose only and there is doubt that the funds will be available for development projects,” Pawar noted. For the workers though, it has become a “do or die” situation as they look towards an uncertain future. Deepak Garjale, a conductor at one of the Pune depots, said, “It feels bad to go on strike for so long and that too during the peak season of Diwali. We understand that passengers are suffering but we also do not have a choice as it is a matter of life or death for us. Already 40 workers have committed suicide due to this issue and many others have suffered health problems since the strike began. The state government should understand our sentiments and demands seriously, and give orders for a merger immediately.”Speaking about the further plan of action, advocate Sadavarte stressed that the state government knows its limitations and that they have climbed down from their adamant position. “The state transport minister cannot appoint drivers directly from outside as 48 days’ training is compulsory and we will continue our legal fight till justice is meted out to the workers,” he said.MSRTC - by the numbersTotal no. of MSRTC depots in the state - 250Number of employees - 96,000Total no. of bus fleet with MSRTC - 18,500Workers suspended till now - 7,500Workers dismissed till now - 1,496Workers who have resumed work till now - 18,000||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/section-of-msrtc-staff-still-on-strike-say-it-s-only-way-to-see-demands-met-101638110540870.html
28-11-2021||Mumbai||Two years of MVA: Turned crisis into opportunity, improved health infra says CM||As Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government completed two years in power on Sunday, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said that the state government would continue to work for the welfare of the common man, no matter how many crises come their way. Thackeray, in a statement, said that the MVA government succeeded in turning crisis into opportunity. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), meanwhile, has called the two years of the state’s ruling party as the culmination of the “pain and misery”. Thackeray, who is recuperating in a private hospital after a spine surgery earlier this month, said, “We did not get distracted with the man-made or natural calamities, and will never get distracted in future as well. No matter the number of crises that may come, we will continue to work for the welfare of the common man.” The chief minister listed out the various decisions and programmes undertaken by his government to showcase the achievements. He added that a greater portion of the two years of the coalition government was spent in tackling the Covid-19 pandemic “systematically and efficiently.” “Despite the pandemic, the government worked hard on various fronts and succeeded in turning the crisis into an opportunity,” said CM. He added that there was a marked improvement in the health, medical facilities, and infrastructure in these two years. Senior MVA minister Nawab Malik said that the government performed better than other states in tackling Covid. He also said that the government has spoken less and done more work. “More than 6.65 million citizens were affected due to Covid-19; Maharashtra was the worst-hit state, even then, we did better than other states, without any complaints of non-availability of beds or oxygen,” Malik said. Meanwhile, Senior Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut, in his weekly column ‘RokhThok’ published in Saamana, listed out the Opposition’s achievements in the past two years and said it was directionless. The Opposition’s list of “achievements” included the misuse of central agencies against MVA, defaming the Thackeray family and MVA in the Sushant Singh Rajput case, allegations against Uddhav Thackeray, Aaditya Thackeray, Rashmi Thackeray, Ajit Pawar, Sharad Pawar, and Supriya Sule and the false case against Nawab Malik’s son-in-law, among other things. Raut said Thackeray braved all the “below the belt” attacks and stood firm against the Opposition. “What the BJP is doing is not politics, but it is conspiring out of desperation,” he wrote. The Sena leader in his column taunted BJP over the 80-hour government of Devendra Fadnavis. “Even though the opposition has not been able to topple the government, it still gives new dates of dislodging the MVA. This is funny,” said Raut, who is also the executive editor of Saamana. BJP leader Ashish Shelar called the two years of MVA government the culmination of the “pain and misery” afflicting the people of Maharashtra. He said, “In reality, this is a government built on nepotism revolving around sons, daughters and nephews... The two years of the MVA government did not centre around the welfare of the people. Instead, it revolved around sons, daughters and nephews of the ruling party.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/two-years-of-mva-turned-crisis-into-opportunity-improved-health-infra-says-cm-101638110360958.html

Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Sunday directed officials to be alert in view of the new variant of Covid-19 and ensure that there are adequate stocks of medicines and health facilities at hospitals. Kumar, who reviewed the ongoing vaccination programme against Covid-19 during a meeting of the health department on Sunday, also stressed that people having returned from abroad should be monitored and those having tested Covid-19 positive should be screened for the new variant. Health minister Mangal Pandey, on Sunday, said, “Though there has been no positive cases of the new variant in the country so far, the health department is on alert mode and directives have been issued to health officials to maintain high vigil during RT-PCR tests for detecting any strain of the new variant so that immediate steps can be taken”. Asked about the central government’s directives to conduct tests of around 281 people who have arrived from foreign countries in the last two months in Bihar, the health minister said the health officials have started visiting the houses of the people mentioned in the list. “Health officials have started visiting the people mentioned in the list who have returned from abroad. There are instances where people have their addresses in Bihar but live in different parts of the country. So, for all those people who are staying in Bihar, we will conduct their tests,” the minister said. Officials said districts had been instructed to carry out genomic surveillance of all Covid-19 positive samples to ascertain the strain of the virus. The state has also instructed officials for heightened surveillance and proper contact tracing of all Covid-19 cases. It has also instructed officials not to show any laxity in testing. Earlier the Chief Minister during a review meeting of the health department asked the officials to accelerate the vaccination drive against Covid-19 and directed that widespread awareness should be done to ensure that people having taken their first dose of the jab should take the second dose. Kumar also stressed that all modes of publicity should be put to use to encourage people having taken the first dose to take the second dose and also accelerate the vaccination drive. “There should be state level monitoring of those districts where the vaccination drive and testing is slow. There should not be any laxity on testing and wide publicity of the vaccination drive,” the CM said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-govt-on-alert-to-tackle-new-covid-19-variant-cm-asks-health-staff-to-be-vigilant-101638110180923.html

This has been a long pending demand from real estate players so as to minimse red-tape. “Some municipal corporations and councils have already made arrangements to offer approval online. From January 1, we have decided to start the online process across the state, except Mumbai. It will greatly reduce the stress on the developers,” said Shinde. He was speaking at the General Body meeting of Confederation of Real Estate Developers Associations of India (Credai) Maharashtra on Sunday. He also unveiled a booklet titled ‘Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) on Unified Development Control and Promotion Regulations (UDCPR). Shinde said that the government has planned to offer an additional Floor Space Index (FSI) to redevelopment projects. “This is being done to encourage redevelopment in the state,” said Shinde. The FSI indicates how high a developer can build on a plot. It is the ratio of total built-up area to the size of the plot. According to Shinde, the complicated rules have been made simpler so that the UDCPR becomes development-oriented as well as people-oriented. This in turn benefits the people. According to Shinde, the demand for the implementation of new UDCPR for Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) region will be considered at the government level. “The developmental projects like Pune Metro, ring road, Samrudhi Highway are beneficial for the progress. The country progresses faster when it’s transport and communication systems are well developed. Maharashtra is the first state to formulate such an integrated development plan for the entire state, which is why it is a matter of great pride for us that other states are also seeking the help of their state authorities to follow suit,” he said. Credai national chairman Satish Magar, said that while creating any manual for rules and regulations, care should be taken on its quick implementation so that it will be easier for the builder to pass on the benefits to the people. Credai Maharashtra president Sunil Furde said, “At present there are difficulties in getting building permits online.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/building-permissions-to-be-made-available-online-soon-eknath-shinde-101638110061340.html
28-11-2021||Pune||Power restored in schools ahead of reopening: Pune ZP||PUNE As the primary schools are all set to reopen from December 1, Pune zilla parishad (ZP) has claimed that the disconnected power supply has been restored in the schools. Earlier, in November the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) had snapped the power supply of 800 schools due to non-payment of bills. According to ZP officials, out of the due bill payment of ₹2.28 crore, ₹1.91 crore has been sanctioned. “With most primary schools reopening on December 1, power has been restored in all schools,” said Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer Pune zilla parishad. Pune ZP operates 3,639 schools in Pune district. According to officials, the MSEDCL had snapped power of 800 schools. Elected members in the ZP claim that this number was way higher than what is being reported. As the higher classes were set to reopen after Diwali vacation, ZP had directed local bodies such as the grampanchayat to pay the electricity bills from their funds. “MSEDCL has informed us that they have restored the power supply in the schools. However, if any school still doesn’t have power the school administration should immediately inform block education officers and MSEDCL,” said Prasad. Despite our repeated attempts, MSEDCL officials remained unavailable to comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/power-restored-in-schools-ahead-of-reopening-pune-zp-101638109820958.html
28-11-2021||Mumbai||Reinforce Covid-appropriate behaviour, task force advises state||Mumbai In the wake of the new Covid variant, Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force has advised the government to stringently screen inbound travellers, reinforce Covid-appropriate behaviour with emphasis on wearing N95 or double masks, focus on vaccination and check the preparedness of the state’s health infrastructure.The task force had convened an emergency meeting on Saturday to discuss the concerns about the new SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.529, which has been named Omicron by the World Health Organisation (WHO). “The literature coming out about the new variant points to its high rate of transmission and its possible resistance to the antibodies generated through the vaccine or natural infection, which is a cause of concern,” said Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state’s Covid-19 task force. “We should not panic, but focus all attention on the best options available in our hand- follow Covid-appropriate behaviour, vaccination and maintaining physical distance,” he added. Globally, the Delta variant of the SARS-CoV-2 continues to remain dominant but the scientific community is particularly concerned about Omicron’s multiple mutations, some of them in the ACE2 receptor- the proteins that are entry points for the virus into the human cells. “All cases of Omicron found so far are mild, but it is only two weeks since we know about it. It’s better to exercise caution,” he said. The B.1.1.529 variant was first reported to WHO from South Africa on November 24. The WHO too has stated that the preliminary evidence suggests an increased risk of reinfection with Omicron, as compared to other variants of concern (VOCs). The health agency has also called for enhanced surveillance and genome sequencing efforts. The task force has asked the state government to speed up the completion of the last mile of vaccination and also run a preparedness check on the healthcare infrastructure in case of a surge. Dr Joshi said that people should wear N95 masks or wear double masks for better protection instead of simply using a cloth mask. “Better ventilation is crucial and closed-door congregations should be avoided,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/reinforce-covid-appropriate-behaviour-task-force-advises-state-101638108981108.html
28-11-2021||Jaipur||‘CM’s advisors or Parliamentary Secretaries not to get any ministerial status’: Gehlot||Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Sunday said that MLAs appointed as his advisors or those who will be appointed as parliamentary secretaries will not get any ministerial status or any perks. Hours after cabinet rejig, CM Ashok Gehlot had appointed six advisors, which include three Congress MLAs and three independents on Sunday. Calling the appointments unconstitutional, the opposition BJP has raised its objection, and also to the possible appointment of dozen parliamentary secretaries. On BJP’s memorandum, Governor Kalraj Mishra has sought clarity on the constitutional status of the appointment.Addressing newspersons at the state Congress office, Gehlot when asked over the controversy, said, “I am only taking advice. Everyone is aware that after Supreme Court orders no one can be given any ministerial status or other perks but if they aren’t given these (status or any perks) what’s wrong?”Speaking on inflation and the party’s December 12 rally on price rise, Gehlot suggested that the Central government should give grants to oil companies to address their financial needs instead of letting fuel prices increase which put pressure on the public. He said that inflation has shaken people across the country and there is a need to curb it. “The GoI should assure people that fuel prices will not be increased so that effective control on inflation can be done.” The CM accused the Centre of weakening the states financially and working against the federal structure. “They are not able to understand the federal structure. They are weakening the states financially. When the states are strong, the country will be strong. The financial management of states is getting disturbed. And all this is happening due to wrong policies of the Centre,” he said.He reiterated that the Centre has reduced basic excise duty on petrol and diesel from which states used to get share and increased special excise duty, additional excise duty and Cess which is kept by the Centre. Gehlot alleged that the Centre has reduced petrol and diesel prices in view of assembly elections in five states and people understand it. “When they can reduce the rates due to election then why cannot they assure the country that the prices will not be increased further?” he asked. State Congress president, Govind Singh Dotasra said that around 40,000 to 50,000 party workers from the state will participate in the rally. “Modi government came to power by making false promises and made the life of the common man miserable. The PM has done nothing to address inflation or unemployment, besides making speeches,” he said. Commenting on the matter, BJP spokesperson Mukesh Pareek said if the appointments made aren’t given any status, then what’s the point making them. “It clearly shows that the CM is trying to stabilise factionalism and destabilise the government by such moves,” he said. Pareek added Congress points at the Centre for inflation but why cannot the state government reduce the VAT like done by other states to provide relief to people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/cms-advisors-or-parliamentary-secretaries-not-to-get-any-ministerial-status-gehlot-101638108381733.html

Calling him ‘accidental and absentee’ chief minister, he said that the government is ‘corrupt, anti-people and useless’ following the MVA government’s completion of two years in office. Javadekar also listed cases of alleged corruption against the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Shiv Sena leaders.“There is nothing worth praising about the two years of this government. It has been the most corrupt, opportunist, anti-people and useless government ever in Maharashtra,” Javadekar was quoted as saying by news agency PTI. “People call it Maha Vasulia Aghadi Sarkar. I want to give it a new name - Maha Vishwasghati Aghadi Sarkar,” he said.Javadekar further added that the MVA-led alliance led to the criminalisation of politics in the state during its two years in office. “While the income tax raids at a prominent NCP minister's residence revealed 'benami' property worth ₹1000 crore, another NCP minister was arrested for kidnapping and assaulting a common man,” he said. “One NCP minister purchased land at a throwaway price from underworld don Dawood Ibrahim's associate who was involved in 1993 serial bomb blast in Mumbai,” he further alleged without taking any names. He highlighted that Maharashtra gave their mandate to the Shiv Sena-BJP alliance in the 2019 assembly polls but the chief minister forged an alliance with rivals NCP and Congress for the post of the chief minister.Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on the completion of two years lauded the government for turning the crisis into an opportunity. He said that most of MVA’s two years were spent on managing Covid-19. He also thanked citizens for their support and said that the MVA is the only ‘people’s government.’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/union-minister-slams-mva-govt-calls-thackeray-absentee-cm-101638107457305.html
28-11-2021||Mumbai||Kurla rape and murder: Premeditated attack; victim was hit with hammer, stabbed 6 times, say cops||The Vinoba Bhave police, which is investigating the rape and murder of an 18-year-old woman in Kurla, have said in their remand application that the two accused, who were arrested on Saturday night, had pre-planned the brutal and heinous act. On Thursday evening, a partially decomposed body of a young woman was found by three teenagers, at a vacant building in Vinoba Bhave Nagar. The preliminary probe had revealed that the woman was raped before being killed. Deputy commissioner of police Pranay Ashok of zone 5 said the arrested accused had carried a knife and hammer, which were used to kill the victim. It was a premeditated attack. Both the accused, slit the throat of the 18-year-old, smashed her skull with a hammer and then stabbed her 26 times in her abdomen and chest, which resulted in her death. The arrested accused are identified as Rehan, 19, and Faisal Ansari, 19. Both were produced in court and are remanded in police custody till December 6. Rehan lives in the Govandi area where the victim stayed with her family, while Faisal is a resident of Bharat Nagar in Kurla (West). “The initial task for us was to identify the body. We circulated the victim’s picture in all the police stations across the city to find out if any missing complaint was registered. It was found that a missing complaint was registered in Deonar police station on November 23. The description of the missing girl and the murdered woman was almost the same. Missing girl’s parents were called and they identified the victim and her clothes,” added Ashok. Senior police inspector Rajesh Pawar of the Vinoba Bhave Nagar police station said, “Once the victim was identified, we started questioning the relatives and people known to the victim. We zeroed in on Rehan and as the location of Faisal matched with Rehan, he was also taken into custody. After interrogating them together, they confessed to the crime. Hammer was recovered from Faisal’s residence and the knife is still missing, which they claim had been thrown in a nullah, near Faisal’s residence.” As per the statement given by the accused, Rehan and the victim knew each other for over two years and the victim was forcing him to marry her. He then hatched a plan with Faisal to kill her. Rehan called her on November 23 under the pretext of discussing their marriage plan. The duo took her on the 13th floor of a vacant building and killed her, said Ashok. “The accused then fled from there. The accused were found hiding at Faisal’s residence and were arrested under the charges of murder, rape and destruction of evidence” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/kurla-rape-and-murder-premeditated-attack-victim-was-hit-with-hammer-stabbed-6-times-say-cops-101638107600808.html

28-11-2021||Patna||Thalassemia activist from West Bengal cycles to Patna with a message||A labourer turned Thalassemia activist from West Bengal, Shyama Prasad Dutt Roy pedalled a distance of nearly 800 kilometres from Alipurduar in West Bengal on his bicycle to reach Patna in Bihar on Saturday, completing a leg of his nationwide campaign to create awareness about the disease as he meets Thalassemia patients and their families.Thalassemia is a hereditary blood disorder, which results in lower than normal amounts of oxygen carrying protein (haemoglobin) in blood and some of its patients have to often go through blood transfusions to survive. People who are carriers of a thalassemia gene show no symptoms and might not know they’re carriers. If both parents are carriers, they can pass the disease to their kids.Roy says he wants to tell parents of potential brides and grooms that they must understand the importance of conducting tests to ensure the would be couple is not Thalassemia minor.There are nearly 4,000 Thalassemia patients in Bihar. Recently, the state government started a day care centre at the Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) for consultation, blood transfusion and treatment for Thalassemia patients.Roy says the harassment and trauma associated with periodical blood transfusions can be avoided if parents decided to test for Thalassemia before bearing a child.Also Read: Bihar wins gold award in 40th International Trade Fair held in Delhi“It’s a hereditary disease and the only way to stop it is to stop marriages of persons with Thalassemia minor symptoms,” he said.Roy says he first learnt about Thalassemia during his numerous visits to donate blood when told that the camps were mainly for the benefit of Thalassemia patients.“I was told that they would be dependent upon such blood donations lifelong. It was shocking. But far more frustrating was the fact that the patients were the victims of ignorance of their parents. I realised that people need to be told to stop it “ he said.The activist said he then decided on a nationwide bicycle tour to spread awareness on the need to test for Thalassemia before marriage.“I have been travelling since November 18, and during this journey, I realised how ignorant people are about this disease and its reasons. I meet the organisations working for Thalassemia patients and ask them to arrange meetings with them to help them understand the disease and its impact,” he said.Mukesh Hissarya, who runs a nationwide network of blood donors and has been working for Thalassemia patients in the state, said testing for Thalassemia during pregnancy should also be encouraged. “ I appeal to doctors to also recommend this test for pregnant women,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/thalassemia-activist-from-west-bengal-cycles-to-patna-with-a-message-101638098001052.html
28-11-2021||Pune||Your Space: There’s risk in opening schools and there are no ways to manage it||With schools set to resume operations from December 1, our readers say that even if schools reopen with proper preparation and investment in virus control, children can still transmit the virus. Though education is too important to keep all remote, parents can’t risk it all Govt should be well prepared The government should be the one to take a call on reopening schools. Children are now bored with online classes. We should open schools not because it would be risk-free, but because schools are important, and the risks can be managed. The state government should take all necessary precautions to keep the school clean and maintain all Covid-19 safety protocols. We are happy with the decision but worried as we read about cases rising in European countries. We are hoping the government is capable of handling the situation carefully. Vijay Ovhal Do not make it compulsory Government should not make it mandatory for every student to go to school. Children do not listen to parents at home to follow the precautionary measures. How can the teachers and staff handle soo many students at a time? Cleaning is another concern. How many times does the school staff clean toilets, washrooms, and class rooms? Standard operating procedure (SOP) has not been declared yet. We have to consider all pros and cons before sending our children to school. Anukush Kandagale Discuss issues with parents Our children travel by school buses. Will they maintain all safety measures during transportation? How will social distancing be maintained in the class? All this has parents worried and creates confusion. The government must conduct a parents and teachers meeting to discuss all these issues. It will help to smooth the process and resolve the problems of parents. Mehaboob Sayyad Consider all aspects before taking a decision I am a principal at a civic school. It is difficult to follow social distancing norms as there are 40 students in each class and we cannot accommodate all of them together. Will the teacher concentrate on teaching or focus on the students’ hygiene? At present, not all students of Class 9 and 10 are attending the school. How can primary school students join school after governments’ decision? I am not against the decision but it should be taken considering all aspects Lack of teachers is another problem. One teacher teaches at least three to four classes. If we decide to conduct classes in batches to follow the social distancing, teachers will have to face a lot of problems. Namdev Jagtap Will not send my child to school Considering that Covid-19 is far from over, I will not be sending my child to the school. If we send our child wearing a mask, is there a guarantee that the teachers ensure she will wear a mask at all times. I do not send my child to the playground in the society due to the risk of infection, how can I take the risk of sending her to school. We are okay with online school. Government should give both options to students offline and online.” Sharad Jadhav Provide better facilities for online education I don’t understand why the state government is insisting to reopen schools when there are only a few months left until the end of the academic year. While countries like China, Europe, Singapore, and Russia are once again imposing a lockdown, despite vaccination, our state government wants us to send our children to school. I don’t think it is necessary at this stage. Instead of doing all these non-practical things, the government should concentrate on providing better facilities for online education. Prashant Kulkarni No preparedness at government level We are not ready to put our children’s lives in danger for school. Education is necessary but is it more important than life? Now that children are used to online education, why does the state government want to disconnect them from it? There is no vaccine for children; therefore, I feel it is risky for our children to attend school. Children are now falling into a vulnerable category. They will come in contact with all types of people when school reopens. Yes, we are thinking negatively for the sake of our children’s future, but there are no dedicated facilities to tackle pediatric units in the state. We don’t see any preparedness at government level. Laksmi Vardhaman Not worth the risk After almost two years, life has started to come back on track, and we do not want to risk it all by sending our child to school. We have has senior citizens in the family who caught the virus and we have been through enough trauma. We don’t want to face the same problem with our children only for school. Our children are happy with online classes in the current academic year. Our entire family will suffer if anything happens to our child. We cannot afford medical treatment right now and it’s not worth the risk at all. Mahesh Vishwakarma Govt should not make hasty decisions I would like to ask government employees and politicians, if they are ready to send their children to school? Are they confident that their child is in safe hands? It is very easy to tell others to do things. The government should not play with the sentiments of parents. Most people have travelled abroad, hence, the government should have to wait, watch and observe the situation instead of taking any hasty decision, especially to reopen primary schools. They should have to analyse the situation of college, secondary schools which have already reopened. Modaram Solanki School’s might increase fees Instead of reopening primary schools, the government should reopen each class after a certain interval so that teachers, parents, school administrators and staff members are well prepared to handle the situation. If schools reopen, the administration will start charging regular fees or may charge more fees in the name of Covid-19 protocols. Common people are already facing financial problems, and the government has also directed schools to cut down school fees. State government’s decision to reopen school may help private school operating lobby instead of children welfare.

28-11-2021||Pune||Curtain call: Theatre and the German connection||The year was 2014. Goethe Institute Max Mueller Bhavan was celebrating its 100th anniversary in India. As part of their celebrations, they had invited a German writer from Switzerland - Mr Charles Lewinsky to address theatre practitioners in Pune and help them get acquainted with his work. Mr Satish Alekar - one of the most important playwrights in India - was going to moderate the session. They had also asked a few of the young brigade in Pune to talk about their work. I was one of them. Mr Lewinsky started his address and I was enjoying the clippings of his plays. They were grand! I remember that one such play was performed on the banks of the lake Geneva. A huge, moving stage was built there. It seemed all his plays were grand. Of course, it helped that many plays received sponsorship from the state there. There was a meet and greet after the session and I had a chance to meet him. I do not know where I got the courage, but I asked him if he had a script that could be performed in India, in venues that were much smaller. I was surprised that even he responded warmly. He thought about it and gave me his email ID. I emailed him after a week and was even more surprised to receive two of his scripts in my inbox! I excitedly opened one of the them to start reading, forgetting the fact that they were in German, which I did not understand! Immediately I sent them to a friend who could read them and asked her to tell me their stories. After nearly a week she got back and narrated their stories. I especially liked one of them. It dealt with the question “Why theatre?”. Something that I ask myself everyday. I started thinking about it and planning it in my head. I spoke to a few friends and even they seemed excited. Before I could actively start this play, a film I was trying to get made was greenlit. Then another, different play. And before I knew it, I had directed three different plays and films. But I always had this play at the back of my mind. The pandemic struck and the world came to a standstill. Theatre was affected the most. And it brought the question “Why theatre?” to the fore. I was reminded of that play again. And I realised that it has become even more relevant in the post Covid era. I got it translated, and finally began its process after seven long years. There is now a new announcement that theatres will open with 100% capacity from the December 1. It is happening after 21 long months! It is wonderful to rehearse every day, just like old times. And now we are waiting for audiences to flock to the theatres in large numbers. Nipun Dharmadhikari is a storyteller and looks forward to telling them on stage, in front of the camera or in person.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/curtain-call-theatre-and-the-german-connection-101638096682991.html
28-11-2021||Chandigarh||Covid-19 fallout: Flight to New York remains a dream||Propelled by a hedonistic whim, I fancied a celebratory sojourn in New York soon after retirement, which was due on September 30, 2019. Undeterred by hearsay that getting a US visa was an uphill task, I downloaded the DS-160 webpage to apply for a visitor visa on the verge of retirement. Interviews for the US visa are held at their embassy in New Delhi and consulates in Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata and Hyderabad. As I hailed from Chandigarh, I chose the US Embassy in New Delhi, as also the first available date for the interview. The long queue at the gate of the US embassy signalled tough competition. Absorbed in observing the body language of fellow aspirants in the queue, I inched forward for security check. After the rigorous frisking, I was ushered into the interview hall to wait for my name to be called. There were many interview counters on one side of the hall. One applicant was called at a time at each of the counters. The expression of dejection or rejoice on the candidates’ face at the end of their interview indicated rejection or approval of their application. The withholding of passport by the embassy symbolised approval. Eventually, my turn came. I responded confidently to the lucid queries, asked gently, about my job, the reasons for a US visit, my stay arrangements in the US, etc. The consular officer, an affable lady, concluded with a smile, “OK, Mr Gupta, you will receive your passport after a couple of days”. I thanked her courteously, beaming. The due diligence in filling in the D-160 electronic application had paid the dividends, I surmised. A few days after the interview and before my retirement, I was overwhelmed with exhilaration upon receiving my passport with the US visa affixed therein. Initially, I intended to go to the US in October 2019 itself. But an NRI friend convinced me that the best season to travel to New York would be the spring season, which is the April-June quarter. So, the next year in February, I booked the flight to New York for the end of April 2020. Feeling upbeat, I started browsing the internet for a suitable hotel in Manhattan. Though the initial news about Covid-19 had started trickling, I never imagined it would jeopardise my trip. By each passing day, the threat of the pandemic started looming larger. Before the end of March 2020, all scheduled international flights out of India had been suspended. India was placed under prolonged lockdown. My air ticket was left in abeyance. When Covid appeared to be abating by February 2021, I rescheduled my trip for NYC for the first half of May 2021. As if my trip was jinxed, the second wave of Covid, more lethal than before, struck our country at that very juncture. Scheduled international flights continued to be in suspension month after month. Broken-hearted, I finally requested the airline to cancel my ticket and refund the amount, which they graciously did. Covid-19 sure did shatter my post-retirement foreign dream as it would have done in the case of million others. chander59@icloud.com The writer is a Panchkula-based retired banker||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid19-fallout-flight-to-new-york-remains-a-dream-101638095840197.html

Followed by the complaint lodged by depot manager Tukaram Salunke, the Kongaon police arrested Vitthal Balasaheb Khedkar, a driver at Kalyan depot, for blocking the bus, sleeping under the bus, and pelting stones on the front and back windows of the bus. The incident took place at Kongaon while the bus from Kalyan depot was heading to Bhiwandi. The accused allegedly stopped the bus at Kongaon and then slept under it. “Passengers inside bus came out and managed to move Khedkar to a side however he then picked up a stone and threw on the front window of the bus and later another on the back window. The windows of the bus were broken in the incident,” said Salunke, who lodged a complaint. On Saturday night Khedkar was arrested by the Kongaon police. “The driver, who is one among the agitators, vandalised the bus. We have arrested him and will produce him to court. He was booked for stone-pelting, vandalism, leading to a hurdle in governmental service. Further investigation in this matter is under progress,” said GD Pingle, senior police inspector, Kongaon police. The MSRTC employees across the state have been agitating since October 27 demanding a merger of the undertaking with the state government that would give them a better salary and greater job security. This has led to the non-functioning of state transport buses. Meanwhile, the Kalyan depot has managed to resume five buses on the Kalyan-Bhiwandi route since Saturday as some of the drivers resumed work. On Sunday the five buses continued to ply on the Kalyan-Bhiwandi route informed Salunke.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/msrtc-bus-driver-arrested-for-blocking-vandalising-state-transport-bus-in-bhiwandi-101638095359747.html

28-11-2021||Delhi||#ShaadiSeason: Long queues at salons on heavy saaya day||Multiple heavy saaya days are upon us, with November 28 and 29 being the busiest. And now, it’s not only the wedding planners and bandwalas who are working overtime for #DilliwaliShaadis, but also the makeup artists and hairstylists. Last year, Covid-19 had slowed down business for many, but this time around, their cash registers are ringing crazy with record number of weddings this season. And Delhi-NCR’s brides-to-be have made sure to book appointments for makeup artists and hairstylists well in advance. “When we started making reservations for my wedding, a makeup artist was one of the first few people that we booked. I was very specific about the one I wanted and my parents fixed the date months in advance,” recalls Bandhana Karmakar, an event manager from Rajender Nagar, who is getting married today.“We have back-to-back bookings most days this season, especially on dates of heavy saaya. We started taking appointments months in advance for today. To maintain order, we are not allowing walk-ins and functioning on appointment basis only,” says Manpreet Kaur, from a beauty parlour in Shalimar Bagh. As last year posed many difficulties for most beauty parlours and salons in the city, many of them are making the most of this wedding season rush. Kaur adds: “We haven’t increased the cost of our services. If there are any slight increases, they are there as we’re using disposable items and following regular sanitisation as per Covid protocols. But we are also refraining from offering any discounts this time. We want to be careful and cover up old losses. In fact, customers are getting slots with so much difficulty that they are not asking for discounts either!” “The heavy rush is something that we anticipated,” says Neeti Saini, a makeup artist from Green Park, adding, “We have hired more staff for these days since. Pichle kayi saalon se double booking aayi hai iss saal. Last year sirf bridal packages ki booking thi par iss saal pehle ki tarah brides aur unki family members bhi full party makeup and hairstyling karwa rahe hai.”Besides one senior makeup artist, there is a team that has been put to work to ensure more bridal makeup requests can be fulfilled. “Humare paas itni bokings hain ki humne four brides ko ek saath bulana padh gaya hai. I do the main work and my team does the rest and I oversee. And today is such a heavy says that I’ll have eight brides coming in to get ready,” says Bhavna Mishra from a salon in Paschim ViharAuthor tweets @anjuriFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/shaadiseason-long-queues-at-salons-on-heavy-saaya-day-101638082039005.html

In view of the emerging new variant of the coronavirus, which was first detected in South Africa, Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar said a day ago that all passengers arriving at the city from that country will be quarantined and their samples sent for genome sequencing.Talking to the PTI news agency, Pednekar said, “There is an increased risk of coronavirus in foreign countries, so those coming from outside will have to undergo genome tests.”Similar restrictions might come into force for passengers coming from other countries affected by the new variant of the virus as well, she said.Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar has also called for a meeting on Sunday to discuss the Covid-19 situation in the state, in view of the emergent variant of the virus.“To take steps to stop flight operations with South Africa, etc, hopefully, a discussion will be held with the Prime Minister soon. Tomorrow, in the meeting, some steps will have to be taken (particularly related to the South Africa variant) to stop the spread from that area and of that variant here,” Pawar told reporters on Saturday.Meanwhile, the central government has also directed states to "rigorously' screen and test people travelling from three countries – South Africa, Botswana, and Hong Kong – where the cases of the omicron variant have been reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/uddhav-thackeray-to-review-covid-19-situation-in-maharashtra-with-divisional-commissioners-collectors-101638073971122.html

They also plan to bring the ashes of the farmers, who died in the Lakhimpur Kheri incident on October 3, and immerse them in the Arabian Sea.Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait told news agency ANI farmers have also planned a ‘Kisaan Majdoor Mahapanchayat’ where they will discuss their demands for all farm-related issues including demand for all crop minimum support price (MSP), implementation of the Swaminathan report, unemployment and other issues.The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in Maharashtra is also expected to join the rally to pay tribute to the lost lives."On November 28, we will support the farmers' rally which is to be held in Mumbai's Azad Maidan. However, no political person will share the stage," Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Nawab Malik said while addressing a press conference earlier this week.Eight people, including four farmers, died in Uttar Pradesh's Lakhimpur Kheri when a speeding SUV—allegedly driven Union minister Ajay Mishra’s son Ashish—rammed into a group of farmers protesting against the three new farm laws in front of UP’s deputy chief minister (CM) Keshav Prasad Maurya and subsequent violence in October.The Centre has said that the bill to repeal the three contentious farm laws will be tabled on the first day of the upcoming Parliament session. Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar is expected to introduce the bill in Lok Sabha on Monday, which was approved by the Union cabinet earlier this week.Meanwhile, the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) suspended its November 29 tractor march to Parliament and said it will hold a meeting next month to decide its future course of action.The farmers' body had earlier said it will not end the stir until the contended farm laws are repealed and all their demands are met.The three laws – the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act – were given assent by President Ram Nath Kovind on September 27, 2020, just days after both houses of Parliament passed them unanimously.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/farmers-to-hold-rally-in-mumbai-s-azad-maidan-today-mva-may-join-101638061446390.html

A species that found rich resonance in religious/cultural life and the noble courts of the sub-continent all but disappeared from Indian public consciousness, barring the odd practitioner of falconry who persisted with his/her passion and procured this bird with increasing difficulty. To add to the goshawk’s woes, it is confused in the public mind with humdrum raptor species, such as Black kites, and its distinct profile erased. To be sure, not a single goshawk is retained in any Indian zoo. Regarded as the most esteemed bird of prey in the Mughal period, its association as a raptor trained to hunt with Mughal emperors, Sindh Ameers, hill rajahs, Bhavnagar kings and Sikh Gurus bestowed upon the goshawk exalted titles and names: Shikari chidiyon ka sardar, Shah-en-Shah, Sikander and Shahbaaz. As delineated by its zoological nomenclature in the Latin --- Accipiter gentilis --- this raptor could only be flown by the nobility. It was adored by kings because of its reckless courage while pursuing prey: a prize female goshawk of the Sindh nobles is even recorded to have brought down Chinkara gazelles! Considered without avian peer in the sub-continent’s chivalrous cultures, the goshawk was exchanged between royals as gifts, delivered as ransom and triggered battles between Sikh Gurus and Mughals. Ornithological literature unearths a money trail peculiar to the baaz. In the bygone era, the goshawk was trapped from Afghanistan and Gilgit-Baltistan and sold for staggering sums to the sub-continent’s princes at Lahore/Amritsar mandis. Just how much was a baaz’s price, when salaries were in annas and few rupees:“The baaz (female goshawk) is the most highly esteemed bird of prey in India and a trained bird used to be sold for a large sum in former days...for prices varying from ₹20-50 and ₹10-30 for the male (known as Zurrah)”, wrote the ‘father of Indian ornithology’,TC Jerdon, in The Birds of India, Volume 1, 1862.“The Shahbaaz is an expensive bird...sometimes costing as much as a (sum) fully equal to £200 in England,” wrote Victorian explorer Sir Richard Burton in his 1852 work, Falconry in the Valley of Indus.“Every Indian prince in whose state falconry still survives does not consider his menage complete without a goshawk, and it is the zenith of every Indian falconer’s ambition to possess a goshawk... ₹150-200 being paid for a young female (baaz) a few days after it has been captured,” wrote CH Donald in his 1920 work, The Birds of Prey of the Punjab.“An American soldier wanted to purchase a goshawk from the famous Amritsar mandi for raptors in 1941-’42. He later wrote in a magazine about his failure to purchase the Rajahs’ bird. This was because the goshawk was available for a princely sum of ₹300 then and was being eyed by the ‘baazdars’ sent to the mandi by the kings with bursting purses. In contrast, a Peregrine falcon was available for ₹5-15 at the mandi then,” recalled Sarfrazuddin Malik, an accomplished falconer who flew raptors in California before returning home to imbibe the art from the royal falconers of Bhavnagar, Gujarat. However, a graded change in the goshawk’s fortunes came about when Punjab adopted the goshawk as the State Bird in 1989 and the species was dusted from layers of archival ignominy. Recorded as a sparse breeder in India and a very rare winter visitor to the plains, the goshawk’s rarefied status is set for a much-needed boost the coming week. Under the Government of India’s initiative to commemorate 75 years of India’s Independence, the Central Zoo Authority (CZA) has undertaken a series of activities under the banner of ‘Azadi ka amrit mahotsava’. The Ludhiana zoo has been tasked by the CZA to focus on the goshawk from November 29 to December 5 and undertake massive outreach activities to showcase the raptor regarded as a symbol of the Gurus and culturally embodying the valorous, martial spirit of the people. vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wildbuzz-the-baaz-from-prince-to-pauper-101638054182283.html
28-11-2021||Chandigarh||Guest Column | When I missed mishap by an inch||‘The incident’ left me numb for several days after it happened. Each time I would sit down for some peace and quiet, ‘the incident’ would play itself in my head. It happened the day, I drove down to my daughter’s school and parked a little ahead the front gate. As per routine, the nanny takes about five to 10 minutes to go get my daughter from class and accompany her back to the car. However, that day she was out in no time and I could see both of them walking down towards the car in the rear-view mirror. So, I did not shift the gear to parking mode. And that was it! That’s when it all happened…The nanny was settling down my daughter in the car and I had my face turned towards both of them. The moment they settled in and I turned my face in front while lifting the brakes; a man and his son were passing right in front of my car. It shudder to think that in that moment I could have rolled over them for my car had promptly drifted forward.God was kind that day, and the petrified father and his cute son, who had no idea what could just have happened, were saved, because I applied the brake in the nick of time. However, for a few seconds after that, I could only shake my head stupidly. Onlookers may have seen me mumbling sorry from behind my face mask, and perhaps the father could have taken my head shake, as either aggression or simply a “gone-nuts” case. I politely gestured them to take their time and cross the road. The father thankfully nodded when he passed by and I was still stupidly shaking my head. Anyway, I drove back home at the speed of 20km per hour that day much to the nanny’s irritation.It was a simple human error. It might have happened to many. Yet, I could not stop thinking or over thinking about what went wrong because with due humility I say I am a good driver despite my gender (sarcasm intended). It was a simple pick and drop your kid from the school task and yet my reflexes were not square enough. I scrolled through doctor Google and came across a recent published study that said that over the years with upgrade of technology, especially the internet, our attention spans have greatly reduced. We have become more absent minded than ever before, losing touch with the subtleties of life that bring the real joy because everything is getting automated. No wonder, our generations have forgotten the art of knitting, the touch and feel of the slumbered brown paper of a Nietzsche book, the thrill of using manual four by fours. Surely, fancy technologies in our daily lives are altering our behaviour pattern, our instincts and reflexes. Or perhaps, I should stop over thinking altogether because “there no zebra crossing” as my father opined. harleen.gurunay.majithia@gmail.comThe writer is a freelance contributor||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/guest-column-when-i-missed-mishap-by-an-inch-101638054000274.html
28-11-2021||Chandigarh||Salubrious Sunday | The picturesque tree with gigantic leaves||While in the hill town of Mahabaleshwar, a tree with gigantic leaves, around two to three times the size of my palm, caught my eye. Marvelling at nature’s exquisite composition, I took a couple of photographs to share with parents and friends, who like me are ardent nature lovers, and walked on. The next day, I again watched the sun play peek-a-boo through the gaps in the trees branches, and its dark green foliage. Again, I captured a few picturesque sun and shadow photographs and felt enriched. On the third day, I decided to climb down the hill to see the exquisite tree bottom-up. I wanted to explore a little more to catch a glimpse of its bark and base – the woody portion that lay hidden from the regular view. And what I saw left me open-mouthed. There were fruits sticking out of its trunk! Some grew in bunches of three and four, and a couple of them in isolation. And they were fairly recognisable – I heard myself say aloud, “Oh! So that’s how figs grow!!” This was the first time I had seen the deliciously supple and seedy anjeer growing on a tree as opposed to the plucked anjeer laid out on a fruits seller’s cart in the bustling streets of Mumbai. The sight left me thrilled for two reasons. One, of course, it was educative to see the fig tree. I could visualise the journey of the semi-ripe brown fruit to the sweet, red, dried pulp we spoon out of fig jam bottles. And two, well, had I not shown the interest and inclination to know the tree a bit better, would I have ever discovered that it was a fig tree? No. And that was despite the fruits popping out of it in bundles, and waving to us, “Hey there! We’re figs!” What if I had not made the effort to go a little further, step down the hill a bit more, and see the tree in its entirety? What if I hadn’t cared to look beyond the gigantic green leaves? Well, I would have returned from Mahabaleshwar with green eyes, yes, but ignorant nevertheless.As is the case usually, the experience made me reflect a bit about life, particularly how little we understand the people we meet, those we spend time with, cross in the garden and say good morning, purchase groceries from, and even our colleagues and domestic help. People, whom we are sometimes quick to judge. People we think we know, but probably we do not. We might cross the tree with gigantic leaves every day, we might smile at its lovely greens, we might even become more than acquaintances and take pictures together, and yet, we may never really know it was a fig tree.anushasingh3@gmail.com(Anusha Singh is a Mumbai-based corporate communications consultant)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/salubrious-sunday-the-picturesque-tree-with-gigantic-leaves-101638053040175.html
28-11-2021||Chandigarh||Guest Column| Last hurrah to the Battle of Longewala||Last week, I received a call from an unknown number. It was a major calling from the golden city of Jaisalmer. He wanted my postal address to invite me for the golden jubilee celebrations of the Battle of Longewala. I was pleasantly surprised, as I had not expected that the jubilee would be marked amid the pandemic. The invitation card has arrived and apart from a day of sightseeing, the main event will be a visit to Longewala where a museum and war memorial have been established. There would be wreath laying ceremony, followed by a half-an-hour re-enactment of the battle. My wife and I , will go, of course, because this might well be my last hurrah as I stand at the spot where I was flying in my small unarmed aircraft as all hell was breaking loose down below in the raging battle field.I also plan to take my son and his family, who will soon be here for a visit from the USA, to the site. Hopefully, the authorities will permit them to see the function and not consider them a security risk. However, if they are not permitted to attend, they can do the tourist circuit, while we do the official one.Earning my spurs I am already feeling nostalgic about visiting the place where I earned my spurs in a short but violent battle that took place on December 5, 1971. I cannot help remember my late flight commander Major Atma Singh, who was called Atom, by his mates. Atom was the first officer commanding of our 12 Air OP Flight that was raised in August 1970. Merely a year and a few months later we went into combat under his leadership. Atom was a simple and down-to-Earth man who believed in pure soldiering. Very different from the rest of the bunch we had there!When the battle is being enacted, I am sure that I would not feel the same as the real battle when a couple of dozen Pakistani tanks were milling around in the Longewala Bowl as the Indian Air Force Hunter aircraft tore into them with their rockets. I would be looking around to see the sand dunes, through which I flew my small plane, keeping an eye on the enemy tanks and directing the Hunter Aircraft onto them. The helipad, which was only 100m long, will catch my attention, because it was here that Atom executed a masterful precautionary landing of his engine-stricken aircraft. He not only saved the aircraft, but also flew it back the next day after repairs, from the narrow road next door. I would certainly look southward and see the sand dune where squadron leader Suresh had a miraculous escape when the tail plane of his Hunter Aircraft hit the dune during a late pull up. The official function would probably wind down, but not my thoughts.After the official function, we plan to drive north to Tanot where the divisional headquarters was located in 1971. After paying obeisance at the Tanot Mata Temple, we plan to head back to Jaisalmer touching Ranau from where we operated during the war. There is an abandoned cemented airstrip there exactly from where we operated on perforated metal sheets that stabilised the loose sand. Standing on that strip, I will remember the first trial landing that Atom and I did on an unprepared surface. It took three attempts before we managed to put the aircraft down safely. Tough place to operate from!Day-long air operations I will remember the day-long air operations that our pilots executed in support of the battle raging at Longewala. Finally, I will remember how our day ended after the last landing, just before sunset. The lovely two hours of de-stressing that we managed to do away from the disapproving eye of Atom. It involved some rum shots and some teen patti in our dug-down tent. I will remember all the participants: Charlie Maitra, Dabbu Mathur, Nat, Bhim Khemani and the IAF bloke CP Naidu, who was the flight adjutant. Not to forget Ramesh, our mess waiter, who took good care of us.That would complete our pilgrimage to the battle field of 1971. As we head back to our hotel in Jaisalmer after a two-hour drive, there will be one thought in my mind. Is this my last hurrah? A final visit to the battlefield where I delivered what I had been trained for. A fulfilment of a soldier’s contract! Well, you never know. I might make it here one more time, if somebody just asks me to come along!bullysangha@gmail.comThe writer is a Chandigarh-based defence veteran and Vir Chakra awardee||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/guest-column-last-hurrah-to-the-battle-of-longewala-101638052861077.html
28-11-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana | Charging ₹4 for carry bag costs supermarket dear||The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission has asked the Easyday supermarket in Rishi Nagar to refund ₹4, which they had charged the complainant for a carry bag, and pay ₹1,000 as compensation. In his complaint, Manu Kumar of Rishi Nagar, had accused Easyday of “unfair trade practices” and “deficiency in service.” On May 15, 2019, Kumar had purchased three articles from the outlet, which cost ₹120. However, the respondent, Easyday, charged him ₹4 for a carry bag that he never asked for. The complainant sought a refund, ₹15,000 compensation, and ₹15,000 as litigation expense. The respondent resisted the same and sought dismissal of he complaint contending that the complainant was informed at the cashier’s counter that in the event of him asking for a new carry bag for purchases from the store, he would have to pay ₹4, as the practice encouraged customers to bring their own bags, and reduced plastic waste. “The complainant has made a false plea that the price of the carry bag was added to the price of the articles purchased by him without his consent,” said the respondent.The commission observed, “The complainant was made to pay a sum of ₹4 towards the cost of the bag after he had collected the goods for purchase, which could not be otherwise carried without a carry bag. It was not brought to the notice of the complainant by way of a prominent notice at the entrance or elsewhere in the store that he would have to pay the additional cost of the carry bag. Therefore, this amounts to unfair trade practice on the part of the opposite party”.The commission pronounced that Easyday shall pay back ₹4 to the complainant along with 6% per annum interset from the date of filing the complaint till the date of actual payment. “It shall further pay a sum of ₹1,000 as composite cost to the complainant”, reads the order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-charging-4-for-carry-bag-costs-supermarket-dear-101638052320120.html
28-11-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana | Transport workers’ stir from Nov 30 if cabinet fails to commit regular jobs||Staging a protest seeking regular jobs, Punbus and PRTC contractual employees’ union members on Saturday announced to go on an indefinite strike from November 30, if the state government fails to take a decision in their favour in the cabinet meeting scheduled for November 29. The protesting employees said the state government had only been assuring to regularise their jobs but no concrete steps were taken. They said hollow promises were being made to woo the voters ahead of the assembly elections. The employees rued that during the last meeting held with transport minister Amrinder Singh Raja Warring on November 22, the union members were assured that the cabinet will approve the resolution to regularise the employees. Union leaders Satnam Singh and Shamsher Singh said protests on Saturday were held at all the 27 depots of the state to make the government remember its promise made to the employees. “If the government fails to regularise the employees in the November 29 cabinet meeting, we will go on indefinite strike from November 30,” the leaders said. “The employees have been protesting for long even as the Congress had made a pre-poll promise in the last assembly elections to regularise the employees in the very first cabinet meeting, if the party is voted to power,” said Shamsher.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-transport-workers-stir-from-nov-30-if-cabinet-fails-to-commit-regular-jobs-101638052020126.html
28-11-2021||Chandigarh||Congress councillor, LIT chairman lock horns over regularisation of flat allotment under OTS policy||Congress councillor representing ward number 68, Baljinder Singh Bunty and Ludhiana Improvement Trust (LIT) chairman Raman Balasubramaniam have locked horns over an application to regularise the allotment of a flat under One Time Settlement (OTS) policy floated by the local bodies department recently.Both the leaders also entered into a heated argument when Bunty visited the LIT chairman’s office in Feroze Gandhi market on Friday.Bunty, later on Saturday, claimed that Balasubramaniam was going against the local bodies department’s November 11 notification by adopting a pick-and-choose policy in regularising cancelled properties. He said that cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu has been apprised of the issue.The local bodies department’s OTS policy for regularisation of cancelled allotments of plots/properties in the area falling under the jurisdiction of Improvement Trusts across the state provided certain benefits that can be availed by the residents who still have the possession of the cancelled properties. To do so, the allottees would have to apply and make full payment of pending dues along with interest, penalty and deemed restoration charges by December 31, 2021.Balasubramaniam refuted the allegations, saying, “The allotment of that particular flat cannot be regularised under the policy as there are anomalies in the allotment of the flat. It was made clear to the councillor. But he claimed that the allotment can be regularised and started misbehaving. The rules are clear and that allotment cannot be regularised. I have also apprised minister Ashu of the entire episode.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/congress-councillor-lit-chairman-lock-horns-over-regularisation-of-flat-allotment-under-ots-policy-101638051780414.html
28-11-2021||Delhi||‘For the first time, we are telling students to dream of a business’: Sisodia||Ahead of the Delhi government’s launch of an eight-episode TV programme featuring its ambitious Business Blasters scheme, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia spoke to HT’s Sadia Akhtar. Sisodia, who holds the education portfolio, said some of the promising ideas that had come up as part of the Business Blaster initiative will be televised. As part of the programme, students in class 11 and 12 will be mentored and provided financial capital of ₹2,000 as seed money to help kick-start their business ideas. Edited excerpts:In schools, entrepreneurship is usually restricted to theory or business studies. What is the motivation behind initiating something like this in schools?Through the Business Blasters programme, we are offering a full-fledged option to students to pursue a career in business. In our society, students are primed to pursue jobs. They are not encouraged to harbour dreams of starting their own company or business or innovation. We are introducing this dream to students for the first time, and I believe it is being done at the right age. By the time students enter college, they are too conditioned to pursuing jobs their seniors have been doing. Changing the mindset at that stage, within three years, is tough. This is why we began the entrepreneurship mindset curriculum in school.How will the government ensure that the projects students work on with the seed money will not come to a halt after school?Delhi government schools have around 350,000 students in classes 11 and 12. We asked them for business ideas and received around 51,000 ideas. Among these, some will fail. Some students may succeed, but might not be inclined to pursue their ideas further and could choose something else in life. The third set of students will be those who succeed. They will be progressive and innovative and will create jobs. These ideas will be taken to the last stage in February, when we will connect investors with the 10 best ideas. We will give direct admission to the top 100 students into institutions such as Delhi Technological University.Will we see stakeholders from the industry mentoring students?Yes, it is already happening. We have asked schools to engage local entrepreneurs and create a panel. At the second stage, as students go to the district and state levels, we will attach business coaches with them. MBA students or others in higher education could serve as coaches. Lastly, investors are aware they are dealing with school students and will coach them.Do you think students might struggle to juggle the demands of the project along with other academic requirements?We are seeking no-objection certificates from parents. Parents are largely in agreement.I have also asked children and they say their studies are unaffected since the programme has energised them and opened up their minds, which will help them focus better.While schools reopened after 19 months, the uncertainty due to Covid-19 has not abated. Has the state considered a response that will allow learning to continue without disruptions?We all have to be prepared but no one knows what needs to be done. The pandemic compelled us to take online exams, prepare results based on past assessments and rethink schooling. Taking a cue from these developments, we are bringing a new online school that we announced in the budget last year. Online education cannot be just limited to a technical shift of the classroom.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/for-the-first-time-we-are-telling-students-to-dream-of-a-business-101638051085076.html
28-11-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana | Firefighters risk life and limb, while safety suits sit smart in safe||The firesafety and proximity suits purchased for the fire department under the Smart City Mission are still lying pristine in the boxes they came in, while firefighters continue to take on flames without adequate gear. The delay in putting the suits to use almost cost a firefighter his life at a burning textile unit in Phase 7 of the Focal Point Area on Friday. The firefighter, Dharamjot, who was dousing flames without a fire safety suit, suffered burn injuries on face and leg, and was rushed to a private hospital. Four firefighters had also been injured and suffered burn injuries while dousing the flames in May 2017. Around two months have elapsed since aluminium firesafety suits were handed over to the department in presence of cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu and mayor Balkar Sandhu in September, and 15 proximity fire safety suits were purchased for the department the very next month. However, the suits have been carefully kept in a store, and have not yet been distributed among firefighters, who put their lives at risk while dousing flames without any safety. Incidentally, firefighters have been demanding fire safety suits for a long time.An official, requesting anonymity, said the firefighters are not used to wearing the safety suits as they have been working without them for a long time. “They find it difficult to work in the suits. Besides, they are be worn only in an emergency, when firefighters have to enter a building or rescue trapped persons. However, things will get streamlined, if the suits are handed over to the firefighters. There are five fire stations in the city and the suits should be equally distributed among them.” There are not enough safety suits for the firefighters. Only 15 safety suits have been purchased against around 100 leading firefighters, and drivers in the fire brigade. The department says more suits will be purchased. “Storing the expensive suits at the fire department is not easy as they can easily get damaged if not handled properly,” said the official. Meanwhile, assistant divisional fire officer, Swarn Chand, said fire safety suits are available for firefighters at the fire brigade headquarters near railway station and they can be worn in an emergency. More suits are being purchased by the department, which will be distributed among the firefighters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-firefighters-risk-life-and-limb-while-safety-suits-sit-smart-in-safe-101638050760011.html
28-11-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana | 4 days on, missing teens found in Dehradun||Four days after two schoolchildren went missing, they were traced to Dehradun on Saturday. The boys, aged 14 and 13, both residents of Baba Namdev Colony had gone missing on November 23. They were studying in the seventh grade at a private school. Assistant commissioner of police (ACP, east) Davinder Chaudhary said the boys’ parents had lodged a complaint at the Tibba police station after they did not return home. The mother of the 14-year-old said that when her son did not return home till 4pm, she contacted the school staff, who told her that her son had not come to school that day, and another child of the same class had gone missing as well. The families suspected that someone had confined the teenagers, after which the police lodged an FIR under Section 346 ( wrongful confinement in secret) of the Indian Penal Code against unidentified accused and initiated an investigation.The police learnt that the children had been spotted at the Amritsar Railway station, but before the police could reach there they had already left and reached Dehradun, where an acquaintance identified the teenagers and informed the police. The boys told police that they wanted to travel so they stole ₹4,000 from their parents. They went to Amritsar and then went to Dehradun.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-4-days-on-missing-teens-found-in-dehradun-101638050460339.html

28-11-2021||Delhi||Worst Nov for Delhi’s air: 11 ‘severe’ pollution days||November has been the cruellest month this year in Delhi, with 11 days showing severely polluted air on the monitors of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the highest since detailed records have been maintained by the pollution watchdog, with three days for the month still to go.On Saturday, the average air quality index again rose to severe levels (402) for the 11th day this month, breaking the record of 10 dangerous air days in November 2016, CPCB data showed. The alarming situation in 2016 had led to the administration declaring an air emergency and putting in place the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) in the National Capital Region (NCR), following directions of the Supreme Court.In 2020, Delhi saw nine severe days in November, and seven in 2019, historical data showed. In 2018, five severe air quality days were seen in Delhi, while this number was seven in 2017.Delhi has not seen a single day of moderate air quality this November.The air has been this poor likely because of the late withdrawal of monsoon and a delay in the burning of farm residue in north Indian states, experts said. The number of farm fires usually drops around the middle of the month, but has only just subsided this year.“We saw a slow start to the stubble fires this season. Usually by November, the farm fires in Punjab and Haryana start declining. But this time, in October there weren’t many fires, but by first week of November it started increasing,” said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director of research and advocacy at Centre for Science and Environment, a non-profit.The pollution peak, however, is largely because of local pollutants in Delhi-NCR, she pointed out.“Currently, the stubble fire share in Delhi’s PM2.5 levels [ultra fine particulate matter] is only about 2-6%, which means that the severe pollution levels that we are seeing now is a result of local pollution in all of Delhi-NCR,” she said.PM 2.5, or particulate matter less than 2.5 micrometres, can enter deep into the lungs and bloodstream, and cause serious health problems.“We need targeted action against local pollution sources, and measures will have to be implemented with greater vigour by agencies,” Roychowdhury said.While the number of severe air days was higher this year, the spells of continuous severe AQI days that last for over two days were for shorter durations, but were more recurrent.Delhi saw its first severe spell from November 5, a day after Diwali, to November 7. The next spell, which also lasted three days, continued from November 11 till November 13. The capital city and its neighbouring areas saw another severe air spell that started on November 25, and with Saturday’s AQI recording of 402, continued again for three days.Air pollution will continue to be dangerously high at least till November 29, the India Meteorological Department has predicted.Along with stubble fires, the local weather this month was also unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants, explained VK Soni, head of the weather bureau's environment and research centre. Delhi this month saw several days when slow and calm winds were recorded, he said.“While November generally is a bad month for pollution, this time we also saw slow and calm winds on many days,” Soni said. “The forecast says that improvement is unlikely before November 29-30. The pollution levels are likely to remain in the upper end of very poor category.”Delhi government spokespersons did not respond to requests seeking comment.A senior Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) official said, “Keeping in mind the dangerous rise in pollution levels, we ordered a ban on construction in Delhi and this ban was later also put in place by the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM). We also banned the entry of trucks carrying non-essential items into Delhi and also ordered the closure of schools.”HT approached officials in the Union environment ministry and CAQM for comment on whether new measures will be taken to reduce severe air pollution levels, but they declined to comment and said measures are already being taken and that the Supreme Court was informed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/worst-nov-for-delhi-s-air-11-severe-pollution-days-101638048719960.html

President, Guru Nanak Dev Thermal Plant Employees’ Federation, Bathinda, Gursewak Singh, was transferred on November 3 to Roopnagar. Singh was among 11 employees whose transfers were recommended by Badal on October 26 in a communication to the PSPCL. Gursewak had approached the high court on November 24 against the transfer order seeking quashing of the same and had also made Manpreet as party. On November 26, the petition was withdrawn as state’s advocate general DS Patwalia gave an undertaking that November 3 order in respect of the petitioner would be withdrawn. In court, it was argued that Badal had nothing to do with the PSPCL as he is not the minister in-charge. The only reason that finance minister has recommended his transfer is that he is MLA from Bathinda and the petitioner being a president of an employees’ association was raising voice against the policies of the state government and actions of the local MLA, it was submitted. It was also informed that as per transfer and placement policy of PSPCL officials, it is clearly mentioned that employees who are due to retire within the next one year may be allowed to continue at the same station. The petitioner retires on April 30, 2022, so therefore, he should not be transferred as per rule. Also, Roopnagar plant to where he is being transferred is not working at all.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pspcl-to-revoke-union-leader-s-transfer-ordered-on-manpreet-badal-s-advice-101638044459696.html

28-11-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: School bus operators demand tax waiver||Even as the UT administration has allowed all private and government schools to start physical classes from primary classes onwards and the attendance has started increasing, school buses are still missing from roads. School bus operators say that they are reeling under losses caused by the Covid-induced lockdown and will be unable to run buses till the administration waives off their tax payments for the lockdown period.Chandigarh School Bus Operators Welfare Association general secretary Jiwan Rattan Sharma said, “Our buses were grounded throughout the lockdown and many of them need to be serviced and repaired. The administration is not giving us any subsidy for this, instead of asking us to pay road tax for a period when these vehicles weren’t functional.”He said though many schools were asking them to resume the bus service, they couldn’t start unless the administration gives them relief. “We demand an exemption from January 2021 to March 2022 and an extension in the life span of school buses to account for the two-year period for which they were not used,” Sharma added.Meanwhile, schools have also reported a higher percentage of parents who are opting for school buses. Strawberry Fields High School, Sector 26, has three out of 13 buses running. “The response has been feasible and from December 1 onwards, we plan to run six of the total 13 buses. However, it is still too soon to start plying all buses,” Atul Khanna, director, Strawberry Fields High School, said.Similarly, Vivek High School, Sector 38, has also been running six buses for around 130 students. Chairman of the school HS Mamik said the attendance in junior classes had gone over 90% and the schools themselves were subsidising bus travel to aid transporters.Principal of St John’s High School, Sector 26, Kavita Das added, “With exams going on right now, we aren’t running school buses yet, but we are working on starting them once exams get over.” She added that with buses completely on a standstill since March 2020, it would take significant investment to get them started, but this is what parents are demanding with attendance going over 50% for offline classes here.Parents are also demanding that the bus service be resumed. Many of them are unable to send their children to school because the buses aren’t plying yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-school-bus-operators-demand-tax-waiver-101638043320696.html

If they speak, they’ll face the jail. They can’t walk freely because somebody will get them killed. Many innocent people were killed.”Referring to the revoking of Article 370, Azad said nobody could have imagined that J&K will be divided into two parts. “The state that is known across the world and discussed in the United Nations and many other countries was downgraded. Usually UTs are upgraded to states and here the state was downgraded its just like a DGP being downgraded to the rank of SHO or chief minister being reduced to an MLA.”“Our struggle will go on till everything is restored,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/struggle-for-statehood-of-jammu-and-kashmir-will-continue-ghulam-nabi-azad-101638043319704.html

When AAP leader Sisodia kept aam aadmi waiting The aam aadmi of Chandigarh waited patiently for Aam Aadmi Party leader and Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia at an AAP event at CII building last week. “We were invited at 5pm, but Sisodia showed up around 7pm. Most of us waited because we know the aam aadmi has to wait for big leaders,” said a local resident. The AAP had invited residents from different walks of life to give their inputs for the party’s manifesto for the December 24 municipal corporation elections. For local journalists, who were asked stay out of the event room, the wait of two-and-a-half hours remained fruitless as Sisodia didn’t take questions on the Chandigarh municipal elections. In hurry to take credit, UT cops jump the gun The credit war between different wings of Chandigarh Police came to the fore last week when a unit, based on “a selective leak”, arrested the suspect who fired at the police in Industrial Area, leaving a home guard volunteer injured. In the hurry to take credit, the police team involved in the questioning of the suspect did not carry out proper verification and identification of the accused. Its claims fell flat as the victim failed to identify the suspect and he was released following a habeas corpus writ in the high court. In the “selective leak”, the police even said that the detained suspect has two cases of snatching against him and the weapon used in the crime has been recovered.

28-11-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: A mix of urban, rural woes in Ward 21||Regularisation of need-based changes, stray cattle menace, poorly maintained roads and general sanitation are on top of the agenda for voters in Ward No. 21 of the Chandigarh municipal corporation this election. After the fresh delimitation, the ward comprises a mix of urban, semi-urban and rural localities with voters having their own area-specific needs and aspirations. In Sector 47, residents are hoping to get the solution to their long-term demand of regularisation of need-based changes, stray cattle menace and encroachments in markets. For the voters in the semi-urban/rural areas — Bair Majra, Faidan and Char Taraf — the issues revolve around better roads, sewerage system and sanitation issues. Previously, Sector 47 was in Ward No. 22, represented by BJP councillor Davesh Moudgil. The semi-urban and rural parts were in Ward No. 23, also having a BJP councilor, Bharat Kumar. More than 80% of the ward’s voters are in Sector 47, and another major chunk in Faidan village. In Sector 47, which mainly has Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) flats, Nirmal Dutt, a resident, says: “There should be an immediate acceptance of the Delhi model for allowing need-based changes in CHB allotments. We want our area representative to support us in this endeavour.” Like in the rest of the city, residents here also complain of stray dog menace. “The stray dog problem has worsened in past few years. Dogs have terrorised senior citizens and children. Even after repeated complaints, the MC authorities remain oblivious to the problem.” In addition to stray dogs, the area residents also have to face stray cattle menace. “From evening to late night, every day, the area is full of stray cattle. People from nearby villages leave their cattle to roam on the streets. The MC officials turn a blind eye to it and the residents are left harassed. It even leads to accidents,” said Jyoti Swaroop Bhardwaj, a Sector 47 resident. Meanwhile, a visit to Faidan village indicates the vast difference in the basic infrastructure between the developed Sector 47 and its rural neighbourhood across Purv Marg. Most roads are in a bad shape, and sanitation is a big issue. “Some development works like the laying of sewerge pipelines have started only recently. The roads have improved, but it is still a big mess. Similarly, garbage is collected but dumped in a nearby choe. The streetlights also work only on paper. We hope after elections, this area gets proper attention,” says Balkar Saini, a Faidan resident and a public sector employee. Another resident, Santosh Kumar, working in a private factory, says, “While the population here is increasing at a fast pace, the availability of basic infrastructure is missing. MC officials don’t respond to our complaints at all.” KNOW YOUR WARD Localities: Sector 47, Bair Majra, Faidan and Chahar TarafGeneral Ward Voters: 12,000 KEY ISSUES Basic infra, sanitation and garbage in villages Need-based changes in CHB houses of Sector 47Stray cattle and dog menace LOCAL VOICESWe want our councillor to support us in our efforts to get Delhi model implemented for regularisation of need-based changes.

He was in Ambala Cantonment to attend “Manthan” School leadership summit-2021 by the National Independent School Alliance (NISA).

There were two others like Amir Magray, who were killed in the Hyderpora encounter but their families got their bodies. And, he (Amir’s father) can’t go to Kashmir for staging protest. He is here in a remote and hilly area.” The junior Abdullah said he had come to express his solidarity with the bereaved family. “Government probes take time. At least the government can hand over his body to the family and at the same time continue with its probe. At least family can perform his last rites, otherwise it would be too late for the family. And, if he was found guilty in the probe, the government can take his body back to Handwara and bury it there,” he added The government has ordered a magisterial probe in the Hyderpora encounter. DGP Dilbag Singh had said that four persons, including a Pakistani terrorist and three terror associates, were killed in the encounter. On assembly elections, Omar said, “Centre is ready to hold elections but the question should be asked to the UT administration whether it is ready. I am afraid, while PM and HM talk about holding elections in J&K, the UT administration is trying to sabotage them.” “Itne sare betaj badshah hain yahan (There are so many influential perons). They will never want the power to be transferred to the people. See what they did with Panchayats and local bodies… power has not been transferred to them as yet,” he added. Omar is currently on an eight-day visit to the Chenab Valley.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/omar-demands-amir-magray-s-body-be-handed-over-to-his-family-101638043139817.html

The committee comprises chief secretary Anirudh Tewari; principal secretary (home) Anurag Verma and DGP Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota. The panel has been asked to submit its report in seven days. “According to the file, additional chief secretary (home) has written three times to the Special Task Force (STF) chief to carry forward investigation in the drug trafficking cases, as the government and Punjab and Haryana high court did not stop it from conducting a probe. It is reflected from the file that the STF ignored the letters of ACS (home); investigation into high-profile drug related cases has been not done under the plea of sealed reports pending with the high court,” reads the letter, that Randhawa had written to principal secretary (home) on October 28, asking him to identify officials/personnels responsible for the delay in taking drug trafficking cases to logical conclusion. The note for formation of a panel has now followed that letter. Randhawa, the MLA from Dera Baba Nanak (Gurdaspur), has directed the committee to explore four points. The first is that with sealed reports pending in the HC, is there any bar on the STF to conduct investigation. The second issue is on whether the STF can take up drug cases registered in Patiala and Fatehgarh districts. The third question the ministers wants answered is, “When the ACS (home) issued directions to the STF chief thrice, why was the direction not followed. In the last query, Randhawa writes that a petition on drug cases dating back to 2013, has been pending for several years; the state government, too, didn’t do a proper follow-up of the case in the high court after May 23, 2018. “Even the officer of the advocate general never filed an application. It has been observed that the case has been not properly dealt between 2018 and 2021 and intentionally delayed,” Randhawa has observed in his note. NEXT HEARING IN HC ON DECEMBER 6STF sources said that it will file a reply if the Punjab government asks it to, saying that previously too, they had filed factual replies. The Punjab and Haryana high court will take up the matter in the drugs cases on December 6; the Punjab government has submitted to the HC that it has no objection to opening sealed cover reports on drugs menace in the state, while alleging involvement of influential persons. Randhawa, who was in Kapurthala, on Saturday, to chair a meeting of representatives of farmer unions and sugar mills told HT, “The move to form the panel is meant to fix accountability of officials for delays in investigation indrugs case. Our government will again plead in the HC on December 6 for opening the sealed reports in the drugs case.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punjab-deputy-cm-forms-high-level-panel-to-probe-delay-in-investigation-into-drug-cases-101638042719449.html

She started with administrative reforms, and was lucky that the farmers’ stir over the three Central farm laws deflected attention from the missing saroops issue. Despite the Covid-19 pandemic hitting the SGPC’s finances, she continued charity work. The firmness that the four-time SGPC president showed during her previous tenures was missing to some extent this time. She could not restore the original Nanakshahi calendar, despite being its supporter. Observers claim this was due to pressure from the Sant Samaj that has ties with the SAD and demands the continuation of its amended version.‘Rose above political differences’Addressing the centenary event of Nankana Sahib massacre in Gurdaspur, she apologised to the community for the mistakes SGPC functionaries had committed in the past and appealed to other Sikh organisations to cooperate with it.Parampal Singh Sabhra, a leader of Alliance of Sikh Organisations, said, “If we evaluate her performance rising above political differences, she has announced the opening of the first Sikh Missionary College for Women at Tarn Taran. She allowed Sikh missionary institutions to speak from the stage of Sri Darbar Sahib, even as traditional Sikh seminaries and sects objected. She also ordered republishing of many precious books, which have been out of print for decades.”She tried to woo Sikh hardliners, staunch critics of the SAD that controls the apex gurdwara body, and avoided a clash on Operation Bluestar anniversary at the Akal Takht on June 6. She even endorsed the jathedar’s views on pro-Khalistan slogans, stating, “This is an expression of the Sikh youth’s ‘josh’ (vehemence). A community losing ‘josh’ is considered dead. We have no objection to it.” No restrictions were imposed on Sikh hardliners and splinter Akali groups, winning her the appreciation of the rival Sikh groups.Sikh radicals also hailed her move to put on display the holy bir of the Guru Granth Sahib that was hit with a bullet of the Indian Army at the Akal Takht. Instead of locking horns with Sikh bodies over the plan of razing the Golden Temple’s oldest serai, the Guru Ram Das Niwas, where the India Army, allegedly, committed atrocities on the devotees in its rooms, she put it on hold.She also announced the preservation of a heritage structure discovered on the premises of the Golden Temple during the construction of a building. Former Takht Damdama Sahib jathedar Giani Kewal Singh, who heads the Panthic Coordination Committee, said, “Bibi Jagir Kaur took some good steps, but these were at her own level. She should have brought the community together.”A section of Sikhs opposed her move of giving the Indian men’s hockey team with ₹1 crore for winning the bronze medal at the Tokyo Olympics. This did not go well with its employees as well; she appeased them with a salary hike. The Damdami Taksal criticised her on issues like the appointment of granthis of the Golden Temple. The Taksal wanted the granthis to be chosen from its students, while she said that recruitment must be open for students of modern missionary institutions as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/reportcard-sgpc-president-bibi-jagir-kaur-remained-low-profile-tried-to-take-everyone-along-101638042359425.html

Channi added that Sukhbir must stop threatening the bureaucracy and the police for only doing their job. “Tactics like protesting at my residence and getting SAD workers arrested will not work. Those guilty in drug smuggling rackets or sacrilege will be punished,” he added. He alleged that the SAD-BJP regime operated drug, transport and cable mafia to enrich personal coffers, while emptying the state treasury. Lambasting Amarinder for expressing gratitude to PM Modi for announcing the repeal of the three black farm laws, Channi added, “I fail to understand that how can a true Punjabi rejoice over this decision, since nearly 700 farmers lost their lives during the year-long agitation at the Delhi borders and in other parts of the state.” On AAP convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s announcement of giving ₹1,000 per month to each woman above 18 years in Punjab, if voted to power, Channi said, “Kejriwal must give figures on how many women have been extended this relief in Delhi. Punjabis are wise and will not be swayed by such false promises.”He added that 11 of 20 AAP MLAs in Punjab had already shifted their loyalty to other political parties. “Even NRIs have realised that the AAP only makes hollow claims, not even remotely concerned with reality,” the CM claimed. Channi also announced ₹25 crore for holistic development of Barnala assembly constituency, including repair and widening of Rajgarh road to 22 feet. Earlier, addressing a public gathering at Mehal Kalan, he had announced ₹75 crore for the development of Barnala. He also announced that Mehal Kalan will be upgraded to a sub-division, besides the construction of an Industrial Training Institute (ITI).

The deceased was identified as Rammurti, a resident of Dumeda village under Tikunia Kotwali area. The agricultural fields, where the casualty took place, was close to Katarniaghat wildlife sanctuary forests, said deputy director, Dudhwa buffer zone, Sundresha, confirming the death in the big cat’s attack. However, he said, “It is yet to be ascertained if the big cat was a tiger or a leopard.” He further said that they were with the grieving family at the time and an inquiry had been set up into his death. According to reports, the victim Rammurti along with others was harvesting his sugarcane crop on Saturday. While harvesting the crop, a big cat hiding in the cane field, which the villagers described to be a tiger, attacked Rammurti and trird to drag his body into the neighbouring forests. However, villagers rushed to the spot, drove away the big cat and recovered the body. Forest range officer Vimlesh along with his staff, Tikonia kotwali in-charge Balendu Gautam and other police officials also rushed the spot and enquired about the incident. Notably, Belrayan range shares its boundaries with Katarniaghat wildlife sanctuary. Movement of big cats and wild elephants has grown in this area, leading to a number of man-animal conflicts. Half a dozen persons in this area have been killed by wild animals since October 6, 2020, resulting in huge public resentment. The forest department on its part has dug out trenches, installed illuminating lights in September /October 2020 to keep away wild animals from human habitations, however, the demographic conditions pose challenge. The officials have also issued advisories, asking villagers and farmers, to be on high alert and work in groups.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/farmer-killed-by-big-cat-in-dudhwa-buffer-zone-101638041159706.html

With a full-sized model of the Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) sitting majestically at the centre of the square, this busy square located next to Chinnaswamy Cricket Stadium is a famous landmark in the city. But unknown to many, the square is named after an Eastern European city – Minsk, capital of Belarus. What is even more interesting is that the city Minsk has a square named after Bangalore. Even though many Soviet day statues and street names remain unchanged, a busy traffic junction and a huge park in Minsk was renamed after Bangalore, to show mutual respect. The two cities, which are known as the silicon valleys of their respective countries, have a 35-year-long relationship. Even though forgotten or unknown to many Bengalureans, Minsk is a sister city of Bengaluru. The Sister City initiative between any two cities will be established to strengthen bilateral exchange relationships in the field of economy and trade, education, culture, information and technology and other sectors of municipal administration; and it dates back to post world war II era. “Prior to this name change in 1989, Minsk Square was known as Queen’s Road Circle. Interestingly, then instead of the LCA fighter, the circle had a famous Ajeet fighter plane. The 1975-make single seater fighter-interceptor that was decommissioned in 1991 was installed at the centre of the junction,” recollected Wing Commander Prakash Kumar, a former Indian Air Force official who served in Bengaluru during that time. Minsk, however, is not the only city with which Bengaluru shares the sister city tag. Bengaluru has signed similar MoUs with Reno City in Nevada and San Francisco in the United States of America. According to urban experts, apart from the MoU and naming circles (in the case of Minsk), these programmes have not made a big impact in improving the infrastructure and governance of the city. A former IAS officer who served as the commissioner of the BBMP said that apart from junkets to these countries, the programme doesn’t boast of any innovations or changes. “In principle, this is a fantastic idea. The fact that a name like Minsk has become a household name in our city shows the success of the cultural exchange in the programme. But, in all three sister city projects, no considerable change on the ground has happened,” he said. Urban expert V Ravichandar said that there are many issues with the programme itself. For example, who has the ownership of the city. “In Bengaluru BBMP is not an agency that has control over Bengaluru. We have Bescom, BDA and many other agencies. Unlike the mayor of Bengaluru city, a major of San Francisco has much higher authority. There is a big mismatch,” he pointed. Ravichander also said that there is potential in the programme, but it is not being utilised. “To give an example, San Francisco has a wonderful open-source project, where all data related to city development is available in public. Developers and entrepreneurs can use this data to come up with solutions to the city’s problem. Even though our officers have visited San Francisco, we keep our data like a state secret. It is a lost opportunity,” he added. However, it is not all a lost cost. In March this year, Minsk Major Vladimir Kukharev met with India’s Ambassador to the Republic of Belarus Sangeeta Bahadur to discuss ways of expanding cooperation between Minsk and Bengaluru. According to a statement, while the Indian side is interested in working in such areas as education, tourism, economy and joint ventures, and the Belarusian side is interested in IT, business and industry. Following the meeting, both parties agreed to expand educational opportunities in technical specialities and information technology in Belarus for students from India. An ‘India Week’ is also expected to be held in Minsk in September 2022 to showcase the economic potential of the Belarusian capital for Indian guests, the statement added. Meanwhile for the average Bengaluru, the “Minsk square” remains a part of their daily life, unaware of its connection with the former Soviet Union city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/minsk-square-a-tribute-to-east-europe-in-the-middle-of-bengaluru-city-101638040859368.html

Speaking to HT on phone, Tikait said that the winter session of Parliament was about to begin and so he had directed union office-bearers and farmers to send 30 tractors and 500 people at Ghazipur border every day to take part in the march to Parliament, whenever a decision was taken in this regard. “We have made our plan for a Parliament march. Let us see whether or not they (government) allow us to proceed,” said Tikait who raised questions over the government’s attitude in accepting the demand of making MSP legal. The farmer leader claimed that only six per cent of the crops were being sold at MSP and farmers had resorted to selling the remaining 94 per cent in the market at lower prices. Asking why the government could not procure the entire crop at MSP when traders were able to purchase 94 per cent of it and sell it further in the market, he said that the issue of MSP was important for improving the financial condition of farmers across the country and the ‘andolan’ ( agitation) would end only after the government accepted all the demands of the farmers. BKU leaders have started reaching out to farmers and union supporters in villages to muster support at Ghazipur border during the winter session of Parliament. The union’s Moradabad division president Digamber Singh, who has given a call to farmers to ensure their presence at Ghazipur border, said, “Meetings are being organised in villages to apprise farmers about the movement after withdrawal of the three contentious farm laws and to ensure their presence in the movement to push the demand for the guarantee of MSP.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bku-call-to-send-30-tractors-500-people-to-ghazipur-border-daily-101638040499230.html
28-11-2021||Lucknow||Akhilesh targets BJP over Lakhimpur Kheri incident||Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav on Saturday accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (of trying to instil fear among people and alleged that its supporters mowed down farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri last month.“The BJP people know only two things — jeep chadhana aur jeebh chalana (running people over with jeep and making tall claims),” he said.Akhilesh Yadav was addressing a public meeting organised by his alliance partner Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party (SBSP) at Sandila in Hardoi district.Eight people, including four farmers, were killed in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence on October 3. The farmers were mowed by vehicles allegedly carrying BJP workers. Police have arrested Union minister of state (MoS) for home Ajay Mishra’s son Ashish Mishra in connection with the death of the farmers. Both the minister and his son have repeatedly denied involvement in the incident.Akhilesh Yadav further said, “Farmers had come out to demand the withdrawal of three farm laws and BJP’s MoS for home and his supporters crushed them under the tyres of a jeep.”“They think they can do politics by terrorising people. The British ruled by dividing and they think they can rule by making people afraid. This time, no one will be afraid and we will wipe them out,” he said referring to the 2022 assembly polls.On coming to power, the SP chief said his party will work for the poor, backwards and farmers. He also hit out at the BJP over creation of jobs. Electricity became expensive as no new power generation plant was started, he said. Yadav assured that the power sector will be reformed if his SP forms the next government in the state.Attempting to touch local sentiments, Akhilesh Yadav said the business of making the famous Sandila laddoos will flourish again once the SP forms the government in the state.“The kind of crisis the government has created, no one is able to offer laddoos to anyone. The business of Sandila laddoos, too, got badly hit under this government and once the SP government returns, the Sandila laddoos work will flourish again,” said Akhilesh, referring to the renowned delicacy of Sandila.Addressing the rally earlier, SBSP president Om Prakash Rajbhar said the price of fuel was slashed after the BJP lost bypolls in several states recently. “This time, if you defeat the BJP in Uttar Pradesh, then the price of petrol and diesel will be halved,” he said. He also promised a caste census if the SP-led alliance comes to power in the state. Earlier, the SBSP had joined hands with the SP.In the 2017 UP assembly elections, Rajbhar’s party had tied up with the BJP. Rajbhar was sworn in as a cabinet minister in the state government. Before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Rajbhar broke the alliance with the BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/akhilesh-targets-bjp-over-lakhimpur-kheri-incident-101638040259402.html

In statement, Sharma said the Kejriwal’s model has nothing substantial to improve the education level of the children and the Delhi chief minister should abstain from the drama being orchestrated by him to sympathise with agitating teachers.

28-11-2021||Mumbai||9.2 million miss second dose: Asha workers battle odds to meet target||Padama Dhisal, an accredited social health activist (ASHA) from Kolhapur’s Vadange village, has already visited the house of a 50-year-old woman, due to receive her second jab, four times this month. The woman was due for her second dose in early November. Mid-November, when 42-year-old Dhisal visited the woman for the second time to remind her to take her second dose, the woman said that she was busy with Diwali festivities and missed the date. In the past week, Dhisal has visited the woman twice and the woman said that she was unwell. “I have tried everything to convince her. I even told her that a lot of benefits like the ration shop will be linked to full vaccination soon,” said Dhisal. The 50-year-old is among the 150-odd people who have missed the second dose in Vadange village alone. She is among the 9.2 million people across the state who have missed the second dose due dates. Maharashtra’s target population is 91.5 million. While the state is close to 80% first dose coverage, its full vaccination or two-dose coverage is merely 41%. Infectious disease expert Dr Om Srivastava said that one dose definitely provides some protection but the second dose is important to ensure immunity against severe disease and hospitalisation. “The pace of vaccination has definitely slowed down,” said state’s immunisation officer Dr Sachin Desai. “Initially, we dealt with a shortage of doses, there was also a momentary shortage of syringes but the drive stabilised as doses started to come in. But the pace of the drive declined again during Diwali,” he said. Data from the state shows that the average daily vaccinations dropped from 760,955 in September to 525,121 in October, and further declined to 463,389 this month.Nearly 70,000 ASHA workers like Dhisal have been on the ground throughout the pandemic, encouraging people to get tested, flagging suspected patients in the villages for quarantine and encouraging the population to take the jabs since the Centre rolled out universal adult vaccination on April 30. Yet, many like Dhisal find themselves struggling to motivate people to get their second jabs on time. The reduced number of Covid-19 cases, availability of vaccines and decreasing fear of Covid infection have resulted in people delaying their second doses, health workers said. According to Dr Pradeep Vyas, principal secretary of the state’s public health department, recent daily vaccination trends showed that the number of second doses administered were higher than the first dose. “The number of people due for the second dose is a dynamic figure, which changes every day, as some of them take the second dose and new names get added to the list as and when people become due for it,” he said.“Some senior citizens fear the side effects, as they had fever and body ache for a few days after the first jab. Some people have flatly denied taking the second dose because of the reducing Covid-19 cases,” said Dhisal, who has been an ASHA worker for 12 years. Kolhapur is among the half a dozen districts in the state that have more than 80% first dose coverage (86.69% in this district), but its full vaccination coverage is only about 41.2%. In some of districts where the gap between two vaccines is high, ASHA workers have started telling the community that no vaccination could lead to other sufferings. For instance, in Nandurbar, which has achieved only 60% first dose coverage and 30% full vaccination coverage, health workers are telling community members that they may soon not get ration or will be barred from visiting marketplaces if they are not fully jabbed. “We have to warn them about worse case scenarios, even if the state doesn’t come up with such mandates,” said Leela Pawra (40), an ASHA supervisor from Nandurbar’s Dhadgaon block. She has 11 ASHAs in six villages working under her. Each one has at least 10 to 15 people under their jurisdiction who have missed the second dose. A large section of the population from Nandurbar migrates to other parts of the state and the country for work. They return just before the Holi festival, which falls in March. “The state has no mechanism to track this migrant population,” said Laitka Rajput, a social activist from Nandurbar. “When these migrants return, there will be a huge risk of a spurt, if they are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated,” she said. Many districts are trying to incentivize people to get the second dose. The Thane Municipal Corporation said that it would not pay salaries to employees who are unvaccinated. In Aurangabad, the district officials have mandated grocery shops, fuel pumps to make sales only to people who have taken at least one dose. In Mumbai local train travel and entry to the malls among other things are linked to full vaccination. Mumbai currently has around 400,000 people who have missed their second dose. Health minister Rajesh Tope in a media conference on Wednesday said that the last mile is challenging. “We have asked staff to put all focus on the districts that have vaccination coverage below the state’s average,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/92-million-miss-second-dose-asha-workers-battle-odds-to-meet-target-101638039600248.html

Tikait was in Amritsar to pay obeisance at the Golden Temple.Replying to a question about BKU’s Haryana chief Gurnam Singh Charuni’s announcement of fighting the upcoming assembly polls in Punjab, Tikait said: “It is his personal view, but the SKM has no plan to enter politics.”He said the coronavirus and the three laws were two diseases against which one-and-a-half-year-long battle was fought. “We have sent a letter to the Union government for resumption of talks, but they want the farmers to go home without any dialogue. They want to defame the farmers,” he said.Answering another query about the SKM’s decision for continuing or discontinuing the agitation if the three farm laws are repealed in Parliament, he said: “The protest for other issues being faced by the farmers will continue.”Tikait said the families of those farmers who were died during the agitation against the three farm laws should be compensated. “The government is mum on the death of farmers,” he said, appealing the Centre to make a law legalising MSP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/skm-has-no-plan-to-enter-politics-tikait-101638039599197.html
28-11-2021||Chandigarh||IT raids on Ayali, realtor led to seizure of ₹4.3 cr: CBDT||The recent Income Tax (IT) raids on two real estate developers, including Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) Dakha MLA Manpreet Singh Ayali, have led to seizure of unaccounted cash and unexplained jewellery worth around ₹4.3 crore.Issuing a statement on Saturday, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) stated that the searches have resulted in seizure of unaccounted cash of about ₹2 crore, besides foreign exchange and unexplained jewellery of around ₹2.3 crore. Raids were conducted on Ayali and developers/promoters of a real estate project in the South City area of Ludhiana - Sunview Enclave. In total, 40 premises, including residences and offices, were covered in a two-day raid. According to the CBDT statement, major finding after the operation against the groups is about the receipt of unaccounted cash on property transactions. Documentary evidences in the nature of ‘agreement to sale’ (known as ‘biyana’ in local parlance) for certain properties have been seized. These documents indicate that the ‘agreement to sale’ for plots has been executed at much higher amount or rate as compared to the consideration disclosed in the registered sale deed of the plot. It has further been stated that ‘incriminating’ documents in the form of lose sheets, excel sheets showing calculation of receipt of funds for certain property transactions, soft data, chats from mobile phones of the persons concerned, etc. were also recovered. Probe shows that unaccounted cash expenditure has been incurred on construction of the residential house of one of the key persons. In one of the groups, defaults on compliances for the provisions of tax deduction at source have also been detected with regard to payments made to the sellers of the land, etc. Ayali and his supporters termed the searches part of political vendetta by the BJP-led Union government as he had been supporting the farmer agitation against the three farm laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/it-raids-on-ayali-realtor-led-to-seizure-of-rs-4-3-cr-cbdt-101638039419034.html
28-11-2021||Lucknow||Farmer outreach: PM Modi may address convention on cow-based agriculture in Varanasi||In what could possibly be one of his first direct interactions with farmers after the decision to repeal three contentious agriculture reform laws, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is most likely to address a farmers’ convention on cow-based organic agriculture proposed in Varanasi in the third week of December.The convention is proposed to be held near Shahanshahpur in the Rajatalab area of Varanasi, said an officer of the agriculture department who asked not to be named. Varanasi is PM Modi’s Lok Sabha constituency.About 2,500 to 3,000 farmers will be invited to the convention, said the officer, adding that they will share their experiences. An outline for the meet has already been drawn up.Those farmers engaged in cow-based agriculture in different states of the country and using cow dung manure in farming will be among the invitees. In addition, agriculture scientists, experts from the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) and farmers from various parts of UP will be invited, said the officer. “A convention on cow-based farming is proposed to be held in Varanasi in the third week of December,” said Varanasi divisional commissioner Deepak Agarwal and added that the date would be finalised soon.Another officer familiar with the matter said that the preparations for the convention are underway. A list of the farmers adept in cow-based agriculture is being finalized for invitation to the meet.Farmers are engaged in cow-based agriculture in pockets of Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and certain other states where they use cow dung manure, in place of chemical fertilizers and prepare natural pesticides using cow dung and jaggery to protect their crops.These farmers will share their ideas on popularising cow-based farming, the officer said. PM Modi will interact with the farmers at the convention and may address them. A team of agriculture department officials will take note of the methods of cow-based farming in order to popularise them in UP.Before or after the convention, Modi is likely to visit Sevapuri, the country’s first model development block in Varanasi where all development schemes have been implemented with a special focus on health and education. A primary health centre, which was set up in Hathi Bazar, was upgraded and several wellness centres were set up. Awareness drives were carried out to bring behavioural change among the people in order that they use toilets. The locals were motivated to ensure that every child is enrolled in government schools. Political analyst Kaushal Kishore Mishra, senior professor of political science at Banaras Hindu University, said that there was hardly any protest against the three new agri reform laws in the entire eastern UP, Avadh and Bundelkhand regions.“After taking the decision to repeal the three agri laws, the convention on cow-based farming is proposed to be held in Varanasi in December. Apparently, the convention is an effort by the government to give a message to the farmers that it is regularly making efforts to increase their income. Keep in mind that the time, topic and place of this convention are very important,” he said.Cow-based farming, prevalent in the country for ages, is zero-budget natural farming, which the Modi government promotes, said Prof Mishra and added that the convention appears to be an effort to connect with the farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/farmer-outreach-pm-modi-may-address-convention-on-cow-based-agriculture-in-varanasi-101638039360310.html

However, the passenger needs to be fully vaccinated before boarding a flight. A negative Covid report is also checked before going somewhere, and if that person returns, then there is no point in keeping him waiting again for a negative test. Many people have complained that they had to wait for 2-3 hours to get reports verified. So, in Pune, we have removed this restriction, provided that the passenger is fully vaccinated and follows all Covid protocol,” said Pawar while addressing press conference after conducting a Covid review meeting on Saturday in Pune. Pawar clarified that this exemption from Covid test is only meant for domestic flights. “However, for international flights, the rules set by the union government for the passengers will be followed,” said Pawar. Earlier, on November 24, this issue was raised by Girish Bapat, Member of Parliament, in a meeting with Airport Advisory Committee (AAC) chaired by him. He had pointed out how the dual check of vaccination certificate and RT-PCR report on arrival is causing inconvenience to the passengers. With a new Covid variant on the rise, Pawar said that the state and district administration will continue follow the guidelines issued by the union government to contain the spread of the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/no-covid-test-report-check-for-domestic-passengers-arriving-at-pune-airport-ajit-pawar-101638039359227.html
28-11-2021||Mumbai||No evidence to suggest accused is a peddler as claimed by NCB: Court||A special Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS) court has observed that there is nothing on record to suggest that Shivraj Harijan – one of the accused in the cruise drugs case – was a drug peddler. The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) had arrested him on October 10 for allegedly supplying drugs to Bollywood star Shahrukh Khan’s son Aryan and his friend and small time actor Arbaaz Merchant – both of whom were arrested by the central agency in the cruise drugs bust case. “There is no prima facie evidence on record to show that the applicant was a supplier of contraband,” said special NDPS judge Vaibhav Patil, who granted bail to Harijan on November 22. “Therefore, the contention of the prosecution cannot be accepted that the applicant is a peddler and that he supplied contraband to the accused Arbaaz,” the court added in the detailed order, which became available on Friday evening. With regards to NCB’s claim of conspiracy, the court said: “Considering, the material placed on record, it cannot be said that prima facie there is conspiracy and abetment, as alleged by the prosecution.” It added that except the statement of a co-accused, there was no prima evidence on record to show that the applicant committed the offence as alleged by the prosecution. Further, as argued on behalf of the applicant, the alleged recovery of 62 grams of charas is non-commercial quantity and rigors of section 37 of NDPS Act would not apply, the court ruled. There is no evidence on record to show that the applicant committed any offence pertaining to commercial quantity and therefore section 29 of the NDPS Act – for conspiracy – would also not apply and the applicant is entitled to bail, it further held. Harijan was arrested from his residence in Murugan Chawl in Santacruz (West), after his name cropped up in Merchant’s statement to NCB. The agency had claimed that Harijan is a part of the city’s charas supply chain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-evidence-to-suggest-accused-is-a-peddler-as-claimed-by-ncb-court-101638039299215.html

28-11-2021||Chandigarh||SAD leaders court arrest outside Channi’s house||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leaders, including party chief Sukhbir Singh Badal, were arrested by Chandigarh Police on Saturday when they arrived to hold a demonstration in front of the official residence of Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi. Senior leaders of the party were stopped outside Channi’s residence in Sector 2 and were taken to Sarangpur police station after their arrest. On Friday, the SAD core committee members had announced they would court arrest in front of the CM’s residence to protest against the alleged conspiracy to implicate former minister Bikram Singh Majithia in a false drugs case. While being arrested, Sukhbir warned state government officials against becoming part of the conspiracy against the SAD leaders. He claimed that the SAD leaders had definite information that the chief minister has ordered the state DGP to register a false case against Majithia. “This has been done after the chief minister held a meeting with Punjab Congress chief (Navjot Singh Sidhu) and home minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa,” he said. All core group members of the party accompanied Sukhbir in the demonstration. Meanwhile, high drama was witnessed on the MLA hostel premises in Sector 4 when an unemployed elementary teacher climbed atop a mobile tower carrying a petrol bottle.The incident took place hours before the SAD leaders were to assemble at the MLA hostel to march towards the CM’s residence. The protester threatened to end his life if the government doesn’t sign orders regarding ending pay anomaly and regularising the services of 180 teachers.SAD leaders, including Sukhbir and Majithia, talked to the teacher and tried to persuade him to come down, but to no avail. Later, they rang education minister Pargat Singh and urged him to intervene. Cong slams Akalis Congress leader Damanvir Phillaur hit out at the SAD for its court arrest in view of the reported move of the state government to register an FIR against former Akali minister Bikram Singh Majithia in a drug case. “It is shameful to see the Akali Dal, a party known for morchas like Punjabi Suba & ‘Jaito’ putting up a ‘morcha’ to protect someone who has links in a drug trade,” Damanvir said in a statement. He said the Akali Dal that was a party known for agitations it conducted for betterment of Punjab and Punjabis has been reduced to a ‘family’ party by Sukhbir who’s only aim is to protect and promote his relatives’ in all sort of activities. Damanvir, son of ex-Akali minister Sarwan Singh Phillaur, who was also once quizzed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in the drug case before he joined the Congress ahead of Punjab assembly polls in 2017, said chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi deserves all udos for allowing law enforcement agencies to deal with drug mafia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sad-leaders-court-arrest-outside-channi-s-house-101638039059227.html

Accordingly, the Estate and Management Department has so far completed GIS Polygon mapping of 3,100 out of 3,600 properties. The city has 3,600 properties owned by the civic body or acquired for various purposes which include schools, hospitals, playgrounds, parks, cultural buildings, fire stations, vegetable markets, ward office buildings, water supply centres, cemeteries, drainage projects, amenity spaces, chawls, community temples and study halls. According to deputy commissioner Rajendra Muthe, there are constant complaints of encroachment on municipal properties, especially open spaces. At the same time, the ‘digital record’ of these properties was not available with the municipal corporation. Therefore, in the last two to three years, the PMC’s Estate and Management Department has taken special measures to prevent encroachment. The property department also undertook the task of ‘GIS polygon mapping’ of all the properties owned by the corporation to prevent encroachments. This comprises information related to latitude, longitude, type of reservation, satellite imagery of current usage and total size. Mapping is done on a scale of 1: 500. Mapping of the remaining properties is currently underway. Community temples, low-lying buildings have not been mapped yet and the mapping of the said properties is expected to be completed in the coming months, said officials. Pune-based activist Saleem Mulla said, “Digital mapping will prevent fraud results and also keep PMC properties safe from encroachment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-completes-gis-mapping-of-3-100-properties-digital-footprint-to-help-prevent-encroachment-101638038999412.html

This is in light of the new variant of SARS-CoV-2 – the virus that causes Covid-19 – that has been named Omicron by World Health Organisation (WHO). The variant, B.1.1.529, was first reported to WHO from South Africa, which has tagged it as a ‘variant of concern. The travel history of all international passengers will be verified through their passports on arrival and would be required to proffer their travel history of the past 15 days. All international passengers arriving at the airport will be examined for symptoms of Covid-19. According to additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani the “countries of concern” include South Africa, Zimbabwe, Botswana, and Mozambique, apart from some Middle Eastern and European countries. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray spoke to the city municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal on Saturday following which senior BMC officials including additional municipal commissioners Ashwini Bhide, P. Velrasu and Kakani, held a meeting later in the day with the joint commissioner of police (Law and Order) Vishwas Nagre-Patil, airport officials and superintendents of all major hospitals as well as members of the state Covid task force, the statement issued by the civic body said. The BMC is expected to update its protocol on testing and institutional quarantine for international passengers following further instructions from the state and Central government. For the state, chief secretary Sitaram Kunte issued a notification on Saturday making the monitoring of the Covid Appropriate Behavioiour (CAB) stringent. The order says that visitors, guests, customers and organisers at events, programmes, shops, establishments, malls, and gatherings should be fully vaccinated. The onus of the implementation of SOPs lies on the organisers or the operator of the establishments/premises. They will face a penalty of ₹10,000 or ₹50,000 for each violation. To be sure, the state has witnessed a significant drop in the daily caseload over last two months. From a daily average of 3535 in September and 2021 in October, the average fell to 905 cases during the first 24 days of November. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner in-charge of BMC’s public health department, said, “BMC is planning, with airport authorities, to check travel history of international passengers coming to Mumbai, basis stamps on their passport, to be checked at immigration counter. This will be made effective right away.” The state has so far made both the doses mandatory for travelling in local trains in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. It has now extended the restriction for all the public transport, including taxis and autorickshaws across the state. Passengers as well as the driver/conductors and, in case of private bus services, operators will be held responsible for failure of the passengers in following Covid-appropriate behaviour (CAB). Violators will be ₹500 individually, and the operator with ₹10,000 per instance. In case of the repeated violations, private operators may also lose their licences. In private vehicles, the onus of maintaining CAB is with the owner of the vehicle, the order states. Organisers and operators of events will be liable to a penalty of ₹50,000 in the first instance, and could lose their licence in case of repeated violations. In case of taxis and autorickshaws, the responsibility of full vaccination will lie with passengers. The state has also decided to restrict and monitor weddings for crowding. The state order says that the number of guests at wedding ceremonies at open-to-sky venues, including grounds, lawns, etc, should not be more than 25% of the venue’s capacity. The local authorities have will ascertain the capacity of the venue. A state official said, “This will be applicable to not only wedding ceremonies but also for other events including cricket, political rallies, and other events. Out of the 2.5 million weddings taking place in India until December 31, 400,000 are expected to take place in Maharashtra and Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-mumbai-issue-steps-to-contain-omicron-101638038939227.html

Pawar instructed the administration for carry out land acquisition for the expansion of the monuments. It was also informed that the Bhide wada school, the first school for girls started in Pune on January 1, 1848, by Mahatma Jyotiba Phule and his wife Savitribai Phule, to be declared a national memorial. The school, currently in a dilapidated state after it was shut down almost 15 years ago, will be developed by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). The meeting was chaired by Pawar and also attended by Pune municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar, district collector Rajesh Deshmukh and professor Hari Narke, who heads the Mahatma Phule chair in Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU). The meeting was attended by shopkeepers from Bhide wada and representatives of residents. Pawar instructed that the land acquisition process for the expansion and development of the project should be done at the earliest to which district collector Deshmukh said that a proposal for the same would soon be formed and submitted. Bhujbal, who attended the meet, said, “In 1984, Mahatma Phule and Krantijyoti Savitribai Phule started the first girls’ school at Bhidewada. Instead of just erecting statue at the place, a school building for girls at the same spot would be a real memorial to the social reformist duo.” Pawar told the administration to hold a meeting regarding rehabilitation of commercial occupants and residents living in the same building in Bhidewada and chalk out the land acquisition process, and settle the matter amicably. He said that everyone should come forward to setting up the school as a good monument dedicated to the social reformers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/expedite-work-of-phulewada-savitribai-phule-monuments-deputy-cm-101638038819379.html
28-11-2021||Pune||Vaccinate 100% beneficiaries in rural Pune with first dose by November 30: Collector||With the confirmation of a new variant of concern, Omicron, and commercial activities operating in full swing, district collector Rajesh Deshmukh has instructed rural administration staff to ensure that 100% beneficiaries are vaccinated with the first dose by November 30. According to officials, there is no shortage of vaccines, but the response at vaccination centres declining as the fear of Covi-19 infection is also reducing in proportion. The Pune district administration had earlier set a deadline of mid-October to vaccinate all the beneficiaries with the first dose, but could not meet the target. “We need to bring in innovative methods to ensure that everyone visits vaccination centres for the first dose. The new variant is a cause of concern, and we must focus on maintaining covid protocols like wearing a mask, washing hands and social distancing. We have been following these for over a year now. It is only because of vaccination that we have been able to curb the spread of the virus, so I request everyone to get fully vaccinated,” said Deshmukh. As of November 24, out of 3.57 million people, rural Pune has vaccinated 3.27 million with the first dose which is about 92%; of these, 1.84 million are fully vaccinated. Thus, the administration has to vaccinate 300,000 people before November 30. In Pune district, 97% of the beneficiaries have received their first dose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/vaccinate-100-beneficiaries-in-rural-pune-with-first-dose-by-november-30-collector-101638038759075.html
28-11-2021||Lucknow||Mathura admn warns against ‘kar seva’ at Eidgah on Dec 6||Agra In the wake of the call given by the Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha (ABHM) to conduct ‘kar-seva’ at Shahi Eidgagh in Mathura on December 6, the Mathura police and administration have warned against any such act. District magistrate Navneet Singh Chahal and senior superintendent of police, Mathura, Dr Gaurav Grover clarified after visiting Sri Krishna Janambhoomi and Shahi Eidgah on Saturday that Section 144 of Criminal Procedure Code was in force and no one would be allowed to disturb peace in the area. “We have come to know from social media about such plans on December 6. No one has sought any permission for any such act at Shahi Eidgah, nor has any such permission been given to any individual or organization. The prohibitory orders under Section 144 of Criminal Procedure Code are in force in the district,” said the DM. “Anyone attempting to disturb peace will be strictly dealt with and tough action will be taken against any one violating law and order on December 6,” warned the SSP. In Agra, activists of Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha led by national spokesperson Sanjay Jaat, undertook ‘amantran yatra’ on motor cycles on Saturday, to invite volunteers for the programme at Shahi eidgah in Mathura on December 6. Police intervened and arguments took place. To recall, national president of Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha (ABHM) Rajshree Chaudhary had said during a press conference in Mathura on November 16 that it would perform “jalabhishek” (a religious ritual in which water is offered to the deity) after installing an idol of Bal Gopal (the child Krishna) at a site within the Eidgah adjoining the Sri Krishna Janmabhoomi in Mathura on December 6. There is a dispute over the land on which the Eidgah and Sri Krishna Janambhoomi are located side by side in Mathura. Various litigations are on in the civil courts of Mathura by Hindu organisations and individuals who allege that the Eidgah was built after demolition of a temple by Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb at the site where Lord Krishna was born.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/mathura-admn-warns-against-kar-seva-at-eidgah-on-dec-6-101638038579275.html
28-11-2021||Pune||Labourer arrested for killing transwoman over solicitation in Pune||PUNE: The Pune police on Saturday arrested a 26-year-old man for killing a transwoman with whom he is suspected to have indulged in solicitation. The deceased has been identified as Sarika alias Sagar Khandu Ujagar, a resident of Mhada Colony, Hadapsar. The arrested man has been identified as Vijay Gayaram Choudhury (26) a resident of Sundarnagar, Katraj who works as a labourer, according to the police. According to the officials, a body was found half-naked in the bushes on November 23 around 8am along the Mumbai-Bangalore highway. The body also had injuries on it. The officials took two days to identify the person by talking to nearby shop or restaurant owners. “A person in a local bar told us that she had left with a man she had met in there. So, we back-tracked her steps and found that she had arrived at the bar in a bus. Prima facie it looks like a murder that happened out of solicitation,” said senior police inspector Kalaskar. The deceased transwoman collected alms on the toll plaza in Khed Shivapur, according to the police. “A young boy who sold fried snacks on the toll plaza who identified her,” said senior PI Kalaskar. The arrested man, who will be produced in court on Sunday, and the deceased transwoman were not known to each other before November 22, according to the police.

28-11-2021||Pune||Ajit Pawar announces further relaxations, contradicts state order||PUNE Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Saturday announced new relaxations for Pune after conducting the Covid-19 review meeting. However, later in the day, the state government issued a notification stating that the district disaster management authority can tighten restrictions but not dilute them, leading to confusion. Despite repeated attempts, divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao, chief secretary Sitaram Kunte and Pune district collector Rajendra Deshmukh were unavailable for comments. As per the new relaxations announced by Pawar, theatres and auditoriums can operate with 100% occupancy from December 1. Cultural programmes and music festivals will also be permitted on open rounds in adherence to all Covid-19 protocols. “Earlier, theatres and auditoriums were allowed to operate at 50% capacity, but with schools reopening there is no point in keeping these restrictions. From December 1, all theatres and auditoriums can operate at full capacity provided all Covid-19 norms are followed. In light of the Covid-19 variant omicron, we will follow the instructions given by the union government,” said Pawar while addressing a press conference. Earlier, on October 22, the government had allowed theatres and auditoriums to function at 50% capacity, but the owners complained about its adverse effects on the business. Though Pawar did not specify the relaxations for restaurants, Pune municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar said, “Eateries are likely to be allowed to function at full capacity and we will issue orders soon.” On Saturday, Pune district reported 207 new Covid-19 cases and two deaths due to the infection. In the past two weeks, the number of active Covid-19 cases in Pune city has jumped from 647 to 823. While the number of critical cases has not shown a drastic change due to patients resorting to temporary solutions and over-the-counter medication according to doctors, the surge in active cases has prompted the civic body to not shut down jumbo centres yet. As per the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) data, in the past two weeks between November 8 and 24, the number of active Covid-19 cases has risen by 176. However, the number of critical cases has not changed during this period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/ajit-pawar-announces-further-relaxations-contradicts-state-order-101638038041046.html
28-11-2021||Mumbai||MVA turns 2: ‘No public celebrations to mark its second anniversary’||While the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government under Uddhav Thackeray has proved its sceptics wrong by completing two years in office, the celebrations are muted due to Thackeray’s recuperation from a spine surgery and the ongoing Covid-19 crisis, whose economic and social ramifications are not conducive to a large-scale commemoration. The looming threat of a third wave of the virus has also played a role of a dampener. The state government has not organised any public event to mark its second anniversary. While Thackeray is recovering after his surgery, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) supremo Sharad Pawar, seen as the anchor and troubleshooter of the alliance, is in Delhi for the impending session of the Parliament. However, Thackeray issued a statement asserting that the government had stood up to “natural and man-made disasters” and would continue to do so in the future. Promising to work for the common man, he thanked citizens for their support. “There are no public celebrations to mark the MVA government’s second anniversary. One reason is that the chief minister is recuperating after his surgery. The Covid-19 crisis is yet to pass, and this may be another reason,” explained a Shiv Sena legislator. “At present, the situation is not conducive for a celebration. Though we have completed two years in office, there is a lot of work that remains to be done. Those who have tried to destabilise the government have failed miserably. The government has worked in adverse situations under the leadership of Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, particularly while handling the Covid-19 crisis,” said Shiv Sena Lok Sabha MP and spokesperson Arvind Sawant. A senior Congress leader said that the MVA’s biggest achievement was completing two years while proving the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)—whose leaders vicariously give fresh deadlines for the collapse of the government—wrong. “Joining hands to form a government was an imperative for the three parties considering the BJP’s onslaught and their impending existential crisis. We have completed two years in office, but the real challenges may crop up in the future as the 2024 elections approach, and an intense eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation between the MVA and the BJP may be in the offing,” he explained. Minority development minister and NCP leader Nawab Malik said that the state government was on an austerity drive due to the Covid crisis and splurging on publicity to mark its second anniversary would be inappropriate. However, it will publicise the decisions taken by it in the last two years, after Thackeray was discharged from hospital. Opposition BJP said the two years of MVA have been of no use for the state. “There is no governance in Maharashtra for the past two years,” charged BJP MLA Atul Bhatkhalkar, while charging that the MVA government was blaming the Centre for every failure from the Covid crisis to the monsoons. He said that Maharashtra was becoming a “rogue state” under this regime. Prakash Pawar, political analyst and professor, department of political science at the Shivaji University, Kolhapur, said more than any internal wrangling or fissures between the allies, Thackeray’s surgery may have put a spoke in the plans. While the Shiv Sena and the NCP were quick to claim credit for any achievements, the Congress traditionally dithered in doing so, and was also in a state of confusion, he observed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mva-turns-2-no-public-celebrations-to-mark-its-second-anniversary-101638037980282.html

28-11-2021||Lucknow||People have seen misrule of BJP, SP and BSP: Priyanka Gandhi Vadra||Congress general secretary and the party’s Uttar Pradesh incharge Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Saturday said people had seen the misrule of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP).She accused the three parties of befooling the people and looting the Bundelkhand region.The Congress general secretary was in Mahoba district of Uttar Pradesh to address a rally at the Chatrasal grounds in her quest to regain the party’s lost ground in one of the most backward regions.In her address centering around farmers and women, she said the current (BJP) government was not able to make water available for irrigation to farmers who were losing lives in their quest to get fertilizer.“The maximum number of suicides by farmers was in Bundelkhand. The farmers who were in queue for days for fertilizer, braving hunger and thirst, died,” she said. The problems that she was briefed about during her visit to the region in 2019 had not changed a bit, the Congress leader said.When the Congress forms the government in Uttar Pradesh, it would constitute a Bundelkhand Development Board that would be linked to gram panchayats and locals alone would get a place in it, she said.The problem of stray cattle, one of the biggest issues in region, could be solved with Chhattisgarh model, she said. The Congress leader also announced 20 lakh jobs for the people of Bundelkhand.She said she arranged buses to provide some relief to migrants walking home during the Covid lockdown, but the Uttar Pradesh government refused to accept her gesture. The Congress leader asserted that the mining policy of UP would be changed if her party came to power. The officials and politicians have formed an extortion gang and elected representatives are involved in land grab and illegal mining, she alleged.Reading out some of her party’s poll promises, she said the women would be given 40% tickets and promised three free cooking gas cylinders to housewives. Girl students would get smartphones and scooters, she reiterated, emphasising that farmers’ loans would be waived.Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel, who was also present with Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, said Bundelkhand would benefit from the Chhattisgarh model of development.This was Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s second visit to Bundelkhand in 10 days. She had earlier interacted with women in Chitrakoot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/people-have-seen-misrule-of-bjp-sp-and-bsp-priyanka-gandhi-vadra-101638036900411.html
28-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi air stays ‘severe’ for second day, relief not likely till tomorrow||Delhi’s air pollution levels remained in the ‘severe’ zone on Saturday for the second straight day, as the city logged an air quality index (AQI) of 402, according to the 4pm bulletin released by the Central Pollution Control Board.India Meteorological Department (IMD) officials warned that an improvement in pollution levels are unlikely at least till Monday, owing to slow winds.“Calm winds are not allowing pollution particles to disperse properly. Similar conditions are likely to continue till November 29. On Sunday, the AQI levels are likely to be in the upper end of very poor zone,” said VK Soni, head of IMD’s environment and research centre.Delhi logged an AQI of 406 (severe) on Friday, and 400 (a notch short of severe) a day before that.The polluted air also affected visibility levels in the city.Senior IMD scientist RK Jenamani said, “Till 10am, the visibility here was around 400-800 metres which improved to 800-1,200 metres later in the day. Delhi largely recorded calm winds throughout Saturday. At the Safdarjung airport, winds picked up for a short duration and reached around 5-7kmph, but that was not enough to help the dispersion of pollution.”He said that at the Palam airport, which saw a maximum wind speed of 10-15kmph, the visibility levels improved from 1,200-1,800 metres in the morning to 2,200 metres by afternoon.Analysis by the Union ministry for earth sciences’ System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) suggested that the high pollution recordings on Saturday were mostly caused by local sources.The share of stubble fires in Delhi’s PM 2.5 (particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) was 6%.Safar also analysed Delhi’s pollution in two scenarios — when stubble fires peaked, and when it was lower.Between October 30 and November 3, when the share of stubble fire in Delhi’s pollution was low, the share of stubble smoke from Punjab and Haryana was only 8% even as local sources contributed to nearly 69% to the Capital’s air pollution.External sources had a 23% share in the pollution levels.In the second scenario, when farm fires increased between November 9 and 13, its share spiked to 30% while the contribution of local sources remained around 52%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-air-stays-severe-for-second-day-relief-not-likely-till-tomorrow-101638035099282.html
28-11-2021||Delhi||Right-wing group wins Delhi Univ teachers’ body polls after 24 years||The right-wing teachers’ group, National Democratic Teachers’ Front (NDTF), won the Delhi University Teachers’ Association (DUTA) elections after a gap of 24 years, with its candidate AK Bhagi defeating the Left-aligned Democratic Teachers’ Front (DTF) candidate, Abha Dev Habib, by over 1,000 votes for the president’s post on Saturday. Bhagi, who is also the NDTF president, received 3,584 votes while Habib trailed behind with 2,202 votes.DUTA elections were held on Friday and the results were declared on Saturday. Five NDTF candidates have been also elected to the 15-member DUTA Executive.Bhagi said that NDTF had achieved a decisive victory which reflected the faith that teachers had reposed in NDTF’s approach. “This victory is important because our voice and concerns will be heard across the country. One can also take corrective measures which can lead to betterment of education and service conditions of teachers,” said Bhagi (58), a professor at Dyal Singh College.Outlining some of the key areas that DUTA will focus on, Bhagi said he will fight for all section of teachers irrespective of their political persuasions or ideologies. He said that DUTA’s immediate emphasis will be on regularisation/absorption of existing ad hoc teachers through legally tenable processes. Further, the teachers’ body will also focus on payment of regular salaries, pension, allowances and arrears to the teachers and employees of 12 fully-funded Delhi government colleges that are part of DU.EC member VS Negi, who is also a member of the NDTF, said that the group last won the presidential post in 1997. Negi said that the body had started making gains again from 2014-15.In the 2019 elections, Bhagi, who then too was contesting for the post of president, had lost to Rajib Ray of the DTF by a slim margin.He said that the previous leadership of DUTA had created a negative environment by sidelining the issues of teachers and focusing on issues national politics. “In the last election, all opposition players had united together against our candidate. The unity and vote bank of the opposition is eroded now. Now, with our victory, there is a change towards positivity. Previously, DUTA had started raising controversial issues of national politics. Now, teachers believe that their issues will be resolved ,” said Negi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/rightwing-group-wins-delhi-univ-teachers-body-polls-after-24-years-101638034558872.html
28-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi: MCD union warns of strike from Dec 13, demands pending salaries||New Delhi: Days after protests by the paramedical staff and resident doctors in two key municipal hospitals, the Confederation of MCD Employees Unions on Saturday issued a “strike notice” to the three municipal corporations of Delhi over non-payment of salaries. The group has also pushed for reunification of the three civic bodies, pointing out that there was no financial distress under the erstwhile unified corporation.The confederation, which comprises of 22 municipal workers’ unions, has stated that a series of protests will be held by individual unions during the next fortnight, and warned that it will transform into a full-fledged strike from December 13 if the issues are resolved.In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the confederation has argued that since its formation in 1957, the erstwhile unified Municipal Corporation of Delhi had never faced a financial crisis before its trifurcation in 2012. “The confederation is persistently pursuing the vital issue of unification of three MCDs so that the problem of financial crisis could be resolved for the benefit of the citizens of Delhi as well as the better functioning of the three corporations,” said the letter, which has also been sent to the Union urban development ministry, home ministry and the lieutenant governor.AP Khan, the convener of the confederation, said that the unification is the only long-term solution to the crisis. “At least the finance departments of the three corporations should be merged so that this frequent problem can have permanent solution and suffering of thousands of employees can be ended,” he said. Khan noted that there is two- and three-month pendency of salaries and pensions in many cases. “We keep on hearing the same arguments regarding fund shortage and the blame game between the corporations and Delhi government about release of funds. Some individual unions, such as paramedical staff, nurses and junior residents in Hindu Rao hospital have already announced token strikes and protests and now we have decided to go on complete strike after 15 days,” he added. The two north MCD run civic hospitals Hindu Rao and Kasturba hospital have been witnessing three-hour pen down strike and protests from doctors, nurses and paramedical staff from last two weeks.Dr Sunil Kumar, the president of the Kasturba hospital Resident Doctors Association said that a three-hour pen down strike was started by doctors on Monday, and all the junior residents have gone on complete strike from Friday. “Right now, the senior doctors are managing the emergency services. We are hoping that nurses and senior doctors will join us from Monday. Despite repeated strikes and assurances of regularisation of our salaries, no solid action has been taken by the higher authorities to find a permanent solution to the problem. While both EDMC and SDMC have enhanced the dearness allowances of their workers, our DA remains pending from July onwards. Last month’s salary has also not been paid,” he added. One of the biggest maternity hospitals in the Walled City, the 450-bed Kasturba hospital oversees over 16,000 deliveries every year. RDA members say that the hospital is overseeing 400-500 patients every day with an average of 30-40 child birth deliveries taking place every day.Khan said there is no uniformity in releasing the salaries of municipal workers, despite several warnings from the courts. “The sanitation department workers have got their salaries. This pick and choose policy should not be in place,” he added. Indu Jamwal, who heads Hindu Rao nurses association, said that through the strike, they are demanding the 7th Pay Commission arrears, DA, two-month pending salary and filling of vacant posts.Jogi Ram Jain, the standing committee chairman of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, said that an agreement has been reached with the doctors of Hindu Rao hospital and they are expected to resume services soon. “We are continuously carrying out efforts to resolve the situation. They should not go on strike for salary delays of 1-2 months when the poor patient suffers. There is delay but salaries are being cleared on a priority basis. These protests are politically motivated,” he said. He added that dearness allowance of only doctors cannot be revised and the decision will have to consider all 50,000 employees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhimcdunion-warns-of-strike-from-dec-13-demands-pending-salaries-101638033898924.html

This will be made effective right away,” additional municipal commissioner in charge of Mumbai’s civic body’s public health department Suresh Kakani.This comes in the wake of the detection of a new Sars-CoV-2 variant, referred to as Omicron and designated as a variant of concern (VOC) by the World Health Organization, which was first reported from southern African countries and has now been detected in other European countries including the United Kingdom and Germany.The state Covid task force has reportedly asked the government to especially monitor passengers from South Africa, Lesotho, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Namibia and Eswatini, and send their samples for genome sequencing, state officials said.“We have shared our information related to the new variant with the central government and have also requested them to suspend the flight services from seven countries. The guidelines related to the Omicron are to be issued by the centre. We are waiting for further communication,” state public health minister Rajesh Tope said.“We have started taking their swabs and quarantine, if required, will be done. The samples will be sent for genome sequencing. There is no need of panic but due precautions need to be taken,” he said, addressing reporters in Jalna district.“We are collecting more information on Omicron. At present our focus is to ensure that passengers coming from seven countries are duly screened, tested and quarantined before letting them out into the community. We are rigorously screening the passengers coming from these countries. In fact, we want government of India to suspend flights from these countries,” Maharashtra chief secretary Sitaram Kunte said.“With Christmas and New Year celebrations, Mumbai is likely to see an influx of international tourists. We are on alert and prepared,” mayor Kishori Pednekar said.At present, India is only permitting flights from countries with which it has an air bubble agreement. South Africa, where the VOC was detected last week, is not one of them. A circular issued by the Centre on November 26 identified a list of countries as belonging to the “at risk” category. Starting December 15, travellers arriving from these countries would be required to follow additional measures on arrival in India, including post-arrival testing. The list includes South Africa, Botswana (where the VOC was also found) and even the United Kingdom and other European countries. An official order issued by the ministry of civil aviation (MoCA) on Friday stated that flights to and from countries that are considered “at risk” can operate at 75% of the schedule if there is an air-bubble agreement in place with India, and at 50% if there isn’t.The last BMC circular which laid down the protocol for international passengers arriving in or transiting through Mumbai was issued on September 1. The circular stated that passengers from the United Kingdom, Europe, Middle East countries, South Africa, Brazil, Bangladesh, Botswana, China, Mauritius, New Zealand and Zimbabwe were required to take a mandatory self-paid tests (RT-PCR) on arrival in Mumbai.The state government has tested more than 20,000 samples of the virus for genome sequencing since May..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/curbs-at-mumbai-airport-to-be-announced-for-international-travellers-amid-omicron-scare-101638015117815.html
28-11-2021||World||‘Race against time’: Omicron adds to Europe’s growing Covid woes||As omicron Covid variant forces nations to close down borders, Dutch health authorities confirmed at least 13 cases of omicron among 61 quarantined passengers, news agency AFP reported.These 61 passengers reached from South Africa on two flights from Cape Town and Johannesburg. The Dutch health authorities are analysing the remaining samples. The cases rising in the Netherlands indicate that the omicron variant is spreading across Europe as it already battles with rising cases in Austria, Netherlands, Germany and Denmark among others.German health authorities also reported fresh cases of omicron variant in Essen and Dusseldorf, news agency Bloomberg reported citing German news outlets.Australia, Hong Kong and Israel are among the countries outside of Europe that have identified cases of the new variant.Experts feel that the current vaccines may not be able to protect from this variant first found in southern African nations of South Africa and Botswana.Moderna Inc. Chief Medical Officer Paul Burton told news agencies that he suspects that the variant may elude current vaccines. “We should know about the ability of the current vaccine to provide protection in the next couple of weeks. If we have to make a brand new vaccine, I think that’s going to be early 2022 before that’s really going to be available in large quantities,” Burton was quoted as saying by news agencies BBC and Bloomberg.European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said vaccine manufacturers needed a few weeks to understand the quality of mutations. “We know we are now in a race against time,” von der Leyen was quoted as saying by news agency AFP.Among southern African nations Angola became the first to suspend all flights from Mozambique, Namibia and South Africa, news agency AFP reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/race-against-time-omicron-adds-to-europe-s-growing-covid-woes-101638121975841.html
28-11-2021||World||Dutch cluster suggests Omicron has a foothold in Europe||The 13 omicron Covid-19 cases identified in the Netherlands on Sunday -- along with additional ones confirmed in Germany and the U.K. -- suggest the new variant already has a strong foothold in Europe. Vaccine makers are racing to evaluate the new strain to see if new formulations will be required. There are indications the symptoms associated with omicron are mild, top South African health officials said. Dutch authorities said they found the cases among 61 people who tested positive for Covid on two flights that arrived from southern Africa on Friday.  About 10% of the travelers on the flights from Cape Town and Johannesburg tested positive for Covid-19. Analysis of the remaining samples is continuing, said Dutch Health Minister Hugo de Jonge. The other travelers have dispersed around Europe and the world. “It is not unlikely more cases will appear in the Netherlands,” de Jonge told a news conference in Rotterdam. “This could possibly be the tip of the iceberg.”Omicron: 5 measures by India to contain spread of new variant detected in AfricaThe Dutch cases mark the most widespread incidence of the new strain in Europe found so far, but the variant has been confirmed or is suspected in at least seven other countries. Germany on Sunday confirmed cases among two people who arrived last week from southern Africa into Munich and one into Frankfurt. More suspected cases are being investigated Two cases confirmed by the U.K. on Saturday -- plus another on Sunday -- along with two in Denmark, all involved travelers from southern Africa. Austria, Belgium and the Czech Republic have suspected or confirmed cases. Australia, Hong Kong and Israel have identified cases, too.  In Campania, Italy, a double-vaccinated traveler who’d recently returned from Mozambique was confirmed as having the new variant, according to Italy’s National Health Institute. The man’s family was also positive and is isolating, with tests under way to determine the strain, authorities said. The swift emergence of omicron threatens to hammer Europe as governments try to deal with a fourth wave of coronavirus cases driven by the infectious delta strain. Austria is in its fourth coronavirus lockdown, the Netherlands has imposed a series of tighter measures, and Germany’s health care system is straining. In many countries, vaccine coverage is far short of levels thought to confer herd immunity -- even as a new strain emerges that may elude current shots. Governments have used the new variant to once again urge residents to get vaccinated -- either with their initial shots or with boosters. The U.K. is leaning on a strong vaccination program as its best defense, and will accelerate booster shots.Global markets were upended on Friday as the news of the latest mutation spurred investors to seek havens rather than bet on assets tied to economic growth. Markets in the Middle East followed when trading opened on Sunday. The European Union moved on Friday to shut down air traffic from southern Africa, and much of the world has followed. The cases so far have been in people who flew before the restrictions were made. The omicron strain has spread rapidly in South Africa, pushing daily coronavirus cases into the thousands from a few hundred earlier in the month. The variant appears to be highly contagious, but it’s unknown how the symptoms compare with other strains of the virus, or whether current vaccines are less effective. Barry Schoub, chair of South Africa’s ministerial advisory committee on Covid-19 vaccines, said Sunday that symptoms associated with the new variant may turn out to be less serious. “Because it has got all these mutations, it does in fact destabilize the virus, it might make it less fit” than the currently dominant delta strain, Schoub said on the BBC’s “Andrew Marr Show.”  “The cases that have occurred so far have all been mild cases, mild to moderate cases, and that’s a good sign.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dutch-cluster-suggests-omicron-has-a-foothold-in-europe-101638118347606.html
28-11-2021||World||China faces ‘colossal’ Covid outbreak if it opens up like US: Study||China could see more than 600,000 Covid cases daily if it mimics anti-pandemic strategies implemented in the US, lifts travel bans, or drops its “zero-tolerance” approach against the virus, new research by Peking University experts said.In the study, published last week by the Chinese Centre for Disease Control’s (CDC) weekly, four researchers have warned of a “colossal outbreak”, which would put an “unaffordable burden” on the country’s health system if Beijing moved away from its current anti-Covid strategies.“More efficient vaccinations or more specific treatment, preferably the combination of both, are needed before entry-exit quarantine measures and other Covid response strategies in China can be safely lifted,” the study said.“The estimates revealed the real possibility of a colossal outbreak which would almost certainly put an unbearable burden on the medical system,” the study added.The research paper, titled On Coexistence with Covid-19: Estimations and Perspectives, compared China’s anti-epidemic measures with that of five other countries: the US, UK, Israel, Spain and France.Despite local and even inter-provincial outbreaks in recent months, China has been able to control the spread of the coronavirus within the country since it first emerged from the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019. There were 98,631 total confirmed Covid cases on mainland China as of Saturday, while the death toll stood at 4,636.Brushing aside criticism against the policy being “unsustainable”, China has continued to implement the “zero-Covid” policy through strict lockdowns for even a handful of cases, efficient contact tracing, hard quarantine measures, and controlled or closed international borders.It also involves large-scale nucleic acid testing, and strict travel and health code management.The new study concluded that the current policies would have to continue in China to prevent any new explosive outbreak of the disease. The study used data for August from the five countries with the researchers looking at the potential results if China adopted similar pandemic response strategies.The study estimated that China would have 637,155 if it implements the same strategies as the US; 454,198 in the case of France; and 275,793 in the case of UK. The research said four tenets for the safe transition from elimination strategies to open-up strategies were needed: Retain flexible non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), maximise vaccination coverage, shield industries and vulnerable groups from the unintended consequences resulting from NPIs, and detect and isolate Covid promptly using extensive surveillance and stronger community social responsibility.“However, due to the large population and relatively scarce health resources per capita in China, it is difficult to fully achieve tenets 1, 3, and 4, especially during a large-scale outbreak; therefore, China needs to be cautious about the decision on the open-up.”The study raised a “clear warning that, for the time being, we are not ready to embrace ‘open-up’ strategies resting solely on the hypothesis of herd immunity induced by vaccination advocated by certain western countries”.Separately, Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist at the Chinese CDC said on Sunday that without the zero-tolerance policy and prevention of overseas importation, there would have been “47.84 million infections and 950,000 deaths based on global pathogenicity and mortality rates”.Wu added that China’s Covid prevention policies were similar to the other BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) countries, the country could have logged 54.97 million infections and over 1.14 million deaths.Wu was speaking at Caijing magazine’s annual forecasts and strategies conference in Beijing on Sunday.Wu said that “mathematical models show that Omicron is more contagious than Delta...but it’s clear that whatever the mutation, our public health measures are effective. Public health measures like wearing masks and social distancing are effective against all mutated strains”.“The prevailing strains this winter and next spring are mainly the Delta strain. Whether the South African variant strain Omicron can develop into the dominant strain needs further observation,” Wu was quoted as saying by Chinese state media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-faces-colossal-covid-outbreak-if-it-opens-up-like-us-study-101638114261465.html
28-11-2021||World||Australia’s new plan to unmask and tackle online trolls. All you need to know||Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Sunday said his government will introduce legislation aimed at unmasking online trolls and holding social media companies accountable for identifying them. The government has termed the legislation a “world-leading” move to “better protect” Australians.Morrison told reporters that anonymous accounts on social media have the capability to bully, harass and ruin lives without consequence and the reforms brought by the government will tackle the online trolls.“We would not accept these faceless attacks in a school, at home, in the office, or on the street. And we must not stand for it online, on our devices and in our homes,” Morrison said.“We cannot allow social media platforms to provide a shield for anonymous trolls to destroy reputations and lives. We cannot allow social media platforms to take no responsibility for the content on their platforms. They cannot enable it, disseminate it, and wash their hands of it. This has to stop,” he added.How the government is planning to unmask online trolls?The legislation would require global social media giants to establish a “quick, simple and standardised” complaints system to ensure defamatory remarks are removed and trolls are identified with their consent.It will introduce new court powers requiring social media giants to disclose identifying details of trolls, without their consent, to victims. The identification will enable the victims to lodge a defamation case.The government said that the legislation will ensure Australians and Australian organisations with a social media page are “not legally considered publishers and cannot be held liable for any defamatory comments posted on their page.” This is in response to a case in which Australia’s apex court ruled that Australians who maintain social media pages can be ‘publishers’ of defamatory comments made by others.“Since the High Court’s decision in the Voller case, it is clear that ordinary Australians are at risk of being held legally responsible for defamatory material posted by anonymous online trolls,” the Australian attorney-general Michaelia Cash said.“The reforms will make clear that, in defamation law, Australians who operate or maintain a social media page are not ‘publishers’ of comments made by others,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australias-new-plan-to-unmask-and-tackle-online-trolls-all-you-need-to-know-101638103657179.html
28-11-2021||World||‘Nothing will move us’: Solomon Islands PM vows to stay in power||The prime minister of the riot-hit Solomon Islands defied pressure to resign Sunday, saying a wave of torching and looting that swept the capital had been orchestrated by a few people with "evil intention" to topple him. Shattered glass and rubble still lined the streets of Honiara as Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare addressed the nation, a reminder of the three-day eruption in violence blamed partly on poverty, hunger and frustration with his policies."It is very clear that the recent events were well planned and orchestrated to remove me as the prime minister for unsubstantiated reasons," Sogavare said, after a night-time curfew and roughly 150 foreign peacekeepers from Australia and Papua New Guinea helped to restore some calm over the weekend."I want to show the nation that the government is fully intent and nothing will move us. We must and will never bow down to the evil intention of a few people," Sogavare said.Many residents of the Pacific island nation of 800,000 people believe his government is corrupt and beholden to Beijing and other foreign interests.During the riots, mobs attempted to torch the prime minister's private residence and parliament before being dispersed by police firing tear gas and warning shots.Sogavare has already blamed the violence, which incinerated swathes of the capital, on an unscrupulous few leading the people astray with false information. He has claimed that foreign powers opposed to his 2019 decision to switch the Solomons' diplomatic allegiance from Taiwan to China are behind the disturbances.On Sunday, the prime minister said the violence had caused 200 million Solomon Islander dollars (US$ 25 million) in damage and destroyed 1,000 jobs in an economy already squeezed by the impact of the Covid pandemic.The government was working on a recovery package to help damaged businesses recover, Sogavare said. And he repeated a promise that the unidentified "instigators" would face the "full brunt" of the law. Over 100 people have been arrested for riot-related activity, the Solomon Islands police said this weekend.Despite the relative calm of the weekend, people were fearful for the outlook, Red Cross official Kennedy Waitara told AFP.Waitara said many of the food shops in Chinatown had been burned down in the riots. "It will not be surprising if we have to experience food shortages and a hike in prices," he said.- Living in fear -"Unemployment will certainly increase in the coming weeks as people will certainly be out of jobs now and will be finding it difficult."The Red Cross official said he had already seen some shops raising prices for rice and other goods. People were also starting to queue for gasoline.Many people were too nervous even to attend church, said Nason Ta'ake, a youth leader at the Wesley United Church in Honiara."There are only a few people attending church services as most are still living in fear," Ta'ake said.After leaving church, parishioners began scouring shops for food and essential goods but very few were open, he said.Two years of pandemic-induced closed borders have left the already ravaged Solomons economy in tatters, deepening widespread joblessness and poverty.An early estimate of the cost, released this weekend by the Central Bank of the Solomon Islands, said 56 buildings in the capital had been burned and looted, with many businesses facing over a year-long recovery.Local police said this weekend that a forensic team was working to identify the charred remains of three bodies found in a shop in the city's burnt-out Chinatown district. The Red Cross official reported few other serious injuries.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Sunday he was being regularly briefed about the deployment of peacekeepers in the Solomon Islands, adding that he expected Fiji to also contribute troops."Although things are very unstable, at this point there are no areas to our knowledge where there has been loss of control," Morrison told reporters.As tensions escalated last week, the Solomon Islands prime minister had begged neighbours for urgent help. In a letter to Papua New Guinea counterpart James Marape seen by AFP, he called for peacekeepers to be sent for a "period of three to four weeks".burs-djw/je||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nothing-will-move-us-solomon-islands-pm-vows-to-stay-in-power-101638102205765.html

The seven people included three vaccinated individuals and all were placed in isolation.The new coronavirus variant has been detected in South Africa that scientists say is a concern because of its high number of mutations and rapid spread.Israel, a country of 9.3. million people, has reported at least 8,184 deaths from coronavirus since the start of the pandemic.Most of its population — over 6.3 million people — has received at least one dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, and more than 4 million Israelis have received a booster. It has more than 7,000 active cases, 120 of them hospitalized in serious condition, according to Health Ministry statistics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-tightens-travel-restrictions-over-new-covid-variant-101638087259969.html

They are currently in isolation at a special health accommodation provided, the federal health department added.Notably, these two passengers were among the 14 people from southern Africa who arrived on the Doha-Sydney Qatar Airways flight on Saturday evening. After two of them tested positive for Covid-19, the other 12 have been sent to 14 days of hotel quarantine in the special health accommodation.Moreover, around 260 other passengers and the crew aboard the flight, who are considered ‘close contacts’ of these passengers, have also been directed to isolate, the statement added.On the other side of the world, Europe has also detected cases of the omicron variant across the continent, with UK prime minister Boris Johnson imposing new measures to stem the spread. Countries across Europe are tightening their own travel restrictions as suspected omicron cases rapidly emerge. Starting on Saturday, Switzerland required passengers coming from the UK to show proof of vaccination and negative Covid-19 tests upon arrival.Beginning on December 1, Spain will also only begin allowing vaccinated travellers arriving from the country.Austria also registered its first suspected case of a person infected with the omicron variant of the virus. Authorities in Tyrol, on the border with Germany, said the fully-vaccinated patient travelled back from South Africa three days ago and wasn’t showing any symptoms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-coronavirus-variant-makes-its-way-to-australia-cases-detected-in-sydney-101638079795741.html

It has now killed nearly 5.2 million people.In August of this year the US intelligence community released a report in which it said it could not reach a firm conclusion on the origins of the virus -- among animals or in a research lab were top scenarios -- because China had not helped in the US probe.The US has also accused Beijing of waiting too long before sharing crucial information about the outbreak, saying that a more transparent handling could have helped halt the spread of the virus.After the US report was issued this summer, Biden accused Beijing of stonewalling."The world deserves answers, and I will not rest until we get them," Biden said in a statement after that unclassified report came out."Responsible nations do not shirk these kinds of responsibilities to the rest of the world."The pandemic is one of many sources of acute tension today in US-China relations, as the two great powers clash over trade, human rights, and the prickly issue of Taiwan, among other matters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-slap-at-china-us-praises-south-africa-s-quick-detection-of-omicron-covid-19-strain-101638063307503.html

28-11-2021||World||UK, Germany and Italy detect Omicron coronavirus variant cases||Britain, Germany and Italy detected cases of the new Omicron coronavirus variant on Saturday and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced new steps to contain the virus, while more nations imposed restrictions on travel from southern Africa.The discovery of the variant has sparked global concern, a wave of travel bans or curbs and a sell-off on financial markets on Friday as investors worried that Omicron could stall a global recovery from the nearly two-year pandemic.The two linked cases of the new variant detected in Britain were connected to travel to southern Africa, British health minister Sajid Javid said.Speaking later, Johnson laid out measures that included stricter testing rules for people arriving in the country but that stopped short of curbs on social activity other than requiring mask wearing in some settings."We will require anyone who enters the UK to take a PCR test by the end of the second day after their arrival and to self-isolate until they have a negative result," Johnson told a news conference.People who had come into contact with people testing positive for a suspected case of Omicron would have to self-isolate for 10 days and the government would tighten up the rules on wearing face coverings, Johnson said, adding the steps would be reviewed in three weeks.The health ministry in the German state of Bavaria also announced two confirmed cases of the variant. The two people entered Germany at Munich airport on Nov. 24, before Germany designated South Africa as a virus-variant area, and were now isolating, said the ministry, indicating without stating explicitly that the people had travelled from South Africa.In Italy, the National Health Institute said a case of the new variant had been detected in Milan in a person coming from Mozambique.Czech health authorities also said they were examining a suspected case of the variant in a person who spent time in Namibia.Omicron, dubbed a "variant of concern" by the World Health Organization, is potentially more contagious https://www.reuters.com/world/how-worried-should-we-be-about-omicron-variant-2021-11-27 than previous variants of the disease, although experts do not know yet if it will cause more or less severe COVID-19 compared to other strains.England's Chief Medical Officer, Chris Witty, said at the same news conference as Johnson that there was still much uncertainty around Omicron, but "there is a reasonable chance that at least there will be some degree of vaccine escape with this variant".The variant was first discovered in South Africa and had also since been detected in Belgium, Botswana, Israel and Hong Kong.FLIGHTS TO AMSTERDAMDutch authorities said that 61 out of around 600 people who arrived in Amsterdam on two flights from South Africa on Friday had tested positive https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/dutch-find-61-covid-cases-among-south-africa-passengers-looking-new-variant-2021-11-27 for the coronavirus. Health authorities were carrying out further tests to see if those cases involved the new variant.One passenger who arrived from South Africa on Friday, Dutch photographer Paula Zimmerman, said she tested negative but was anxious for the days to come."I’ve been told that they expect that a lot more people will test positive after five days. It's a little scary the idea that you’ve been in a plane with a lot of people who tested positive," she said.Financial markets plunged on Friday, especially stocks of airlines and others in the travel sector, as investors worried the variant could cause another surge in the pandemic. Oil prices tumbled by about $10 a barrel.It could take weeks for scientists to fully understand the variant's mutations and whether existing vaccines and treatments are effective against it.TRAVEL CURBSAlthough epidemiologists say travel curbs may be too late to stop Omicron from circulating globally, many countries around the world - including the United States, Brazil, Canada and European Union nations - announced travel bans or restrictions on southern Africa on Friday.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and State Department added on Saturday to Washington's previously announced travel restrictions, advising against travel to eight southern African countries.Also on Saturday, Australia said it would ban non-citizens who have been in nine southern African countries from entering and will require supervised 14-day quarantines for Australian citizens returning from there.Japan said it would extend its tightened border controls to three more African countries after imposing curbs on travel from South Africa, Botswana, Eswatini, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Lesotho on Friday.Britain also said it was expanding its "red list" to put travel curbs on more southern Africa countries, while South Korea, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Oman, Kuwait and Hungary announced travel restrictions on southern African nations.South Africa is worried that the curbs will hurt tourism and other sectors of its economy, the foreign ministry said on Saturday, adding the government is engaging with countries that have imposed travel bans to persuade them to reconsider.Omicron has emerged as many countries in Europe are already battling a surge in COVID-19 infections, and some have re-introduced restrictions on social activity to try to stop the spread. Austria and Slovakia have entered lockdowns.VACCINATIONSThe new variant has also thrown a spotlight on disparities in how far the world's population is vaccinated. Even as many developed countries are giving third-dose boosters, less than 7% of people in low-income countries have received their first COVID-19 shot, according to medical and human rights groups.Seth Berkley, CEO of the GAVI Vaccine Alliance that with the WHO co-leads the COVAX initiative to push for equitable distribution of vaccines, said this was essential to ward off the emergence of more coronavirus variants.“While we still need to know more about Omicron, we do know that as long as large portions of the world’s population are unvaccinated, variants will continue to appear, and the pandemic will continue to be prolonged," he said in a statement to Reuters."We will only prevent variants from emerging if we are able to protect all of the world’s population, not just the wealthy parts."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-germany-and-italy-detect-omicron-coronavirus-variant-cases-101638054048149.html
28-11-2021||World||Covid-19 vaccine makers study new variant’s impact||The impact the new variant will have on vaccines could become clear relatively soon.BioNTech, which works with Pfizer said it’s beginning lab studies on the variant and should have the first data on how it interacts with the vaccine within two weeks.“In the event that [a] vaccine-escape variant emerges, Pfizer and BioNTech expect to be able to develop and produce a tailor-made vaccine against that variant in approximately 100 days, subject to regulatory approval,” a company spokeswoman said in an email.Moderna said on Friday that it is also working on a high-dose version of the booster, new multivalent boosters and a new booster specific to Omicron. Moderna said it is typically able to get new experimental vaccines into testing in 60 to 90 days.“The mutations in the Omicron variant are concerning and for several days, we have been moving as fast as possible to execute our strategy to address this variant,” said Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel.Mutations may also help Omicron elude the antibody treatments, such as Roche Holding and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals’ Ronapreve, that have become a mainstay of therapy for people who can’t muster an adequate immune response on their own.Roche’s researchers are studying the new variant, said spokesman Karsten Kleine, and it’s too early to say how it will interact with the antibody cocktail.GlaxoSmithKline, which markets a Covid antibody with Vir Biotechnology, said it believes its antibody will probably work against the variant because it targets part of the spike protein that’s shared among many different, distantly related coronaviruses.The company is working urgently to confirm that in the lab, it said in a statement.Johnson & Johnson, the maker of a one-dose Covid-19 shot, is already testing its vaccine against B.1.1.529 variant, CNBC reported, citing the company.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-vaccine-makers-study-new-variant-s-impact-101638048140544.html

28-11-2021||World||Calm returns to Solomons capital after deadly riots||Calm returned to the Solomon Islands' capital Honiara Saturday after days of rioting left at least three dead and reduced sections of the city to smouldering ruins.Petrol stations, shops and other businesses began to reopen, with Honiara residents flocking to buy basic provisions as the violence ebbed."The situation is very tense and anything could happen anytime," said Audrey Awao, a working mother who worried there would soon be no food left in the shops.What began as a small protest on Wednesday quickly descended into a violent free-for-all, with poor Honiara residents joining anti-government protesters to rampage through the shattered glass and burnt-out remains of businesses for things to eat or sell.For three straight days, angry mobs cut through the usually sleepy seaside capital, demanding the removal of Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare.Two years of pandemic-induced closed borders have left the already ravaged Solomons economy in tatters, deepening widespread joblessness and poverty among the population of around 800,000.An early estimate of the cost, released by the Central Bank of the Solomon Islands, said 56 buildings in the capital had been burnt and looted, with many businesses facing over a year-long recovery.While the loss to the economy was expected to be at least $28 million (24.7 million euros), with the bank's governor warning that the nation's accounts -- already struggling to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic -- had been further weakened by the riots.A more thorough estimate of the damage would be released in the coming days, he added."Now the PM needs to step down," a self-employed 32-year-old who gave his name as Selson told AFP. "That's the demand for all citizens of the Solomon Islands."Local police said a forensic team was working to identify the charred remains of three bodies found in a shop in the city's burnt-out Chinatown district.Heavily armed police were a visible presence on nearby streets as locals began clean up operations and limited bus services resumed.A night-time curfew and the presence of roughly 150 foreign peacekeepers from Australia and Papua New Guinea appeared to have helped cool tensions.But the scale of the recovery was coming into sharp focus, even as the city remained on edge."It is very frustrating as it took me more than three hours to reach the fuel pump to get my vehicle fuelled," Awao told AFP.Hungry mobsMany Solomon Islanders believe their government is corrupt and beholden to Beijing and other foreign interests."Most people are barely getting one meal a day, there are no tourists and very little economic stimulus," Douglas Kelson, chief officer at St John Ambulance Service, told AFP."People do things they normally wouldn't when they are hungry," Kelson said.Protesters channelled their anger directly at Sogavare and his government, with mobs attempting to torch parliament and the prime minister's private residence as police fired tear gas and warning shots.Over 100 people have been arrested for riot-related activity, Solomon Islands police said Saturday as they tried to restore order."No one is above the law," said commissioner Mostyn Mangau, urging residents to "respect each other, as well as our visiting friends from abroad".'Brought to its knees'As tensions escalated, Sogavare had begged neighbours for urgent help.In a letter obtained by AFP, the prime minister told his Papua New Guinea counterpart James Marape that "certain elements" had "attempted to overthrow a democratically elected government" and called for peacekeepers to be sent for a "period of three to four weeks".In an address to the nation, Sogavare told citizens the Solomons had been "brought to its knees" by the rioting but vowed to resist calls for his resignation.But the political situation remained fraught. Opposition leaders on Saturday called for a vote of no confidence in Sogavare's leadership.They may not yet have enough votes to pass the motion and remove Sogavare from office, but the move could produce another flashpoint.The pro-Beijing leader claimed foreign powers opposed to his 2019 decision to switch the Solomons' diplomatic allegiance from Taiwan to China were behind the disturbances.But others pointed to inter-island tensions and widespread joblessness among the country's population -- 40 percent of whom are under 14 years of age.The archipelago nation has for decades endured ethnic and political tensions.Residents of the populous Malaita province have long complained that their island is neglected by the central government, and divisions intensified when Sogavare recognised Beijing.China's government on Friday condemned the violence and vowed to "safeguard the safety and legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens and institutions".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/calm-returns-to-solomons-capital-after-deadly-riots-101638047945961.html
28-11-2021||World||Japan's Kishida vows to counter China, North Korea threats||Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, at his first troop review Saturday, renewed his pledge to consider “all options,” including acquiring enemy base strike capability, and vowed to create a stronger Self-Defense Force to protect the country amid growing threats from China and North Korea.Kishida said the security situation around Japan is rapidly changing and that “the reality is severer than ever,” with North Korea continuing to test-fire ballistic missiles while advancing its capability, and China pursuing a military buildup and increasingly assertive activity in the region.“I will consider all options, including possessing so-called enemy base strike capability, to pursue strengthening of defense power that is necessary,” Kishida said in an address to hundreds of Ground Self-Defense Force members in olive-colored helmets and uniforms.Kishida, who took office in October, served as top commander for the first time at Saturday's Self-Defense Force troop review held at the main army base Camp Asaka, north of Tokyo. About 800 troops gathered for the inspection, according to the Defense Ministry.“The security environment surrounding Japan has been rapidly changing at an unprecedented speed. Things that used to happen only in science-fiction novels are today's reality,” Kishida said. He said his government will lead “calm and realistic” discussions to determine what is needed to protect people's lives and gain their understanding.The possibility of possessing so-called enemy base strike capability has been a divisive issue because opponents say it violates Japan’s war-renouncing Constitution.Kishida has shifted his dovish stance to a more hawkish one, apparently to please influential leaders within his governing party, including former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, and to strengthen his grip on power. He now advocates increasing Japanese military capability and spending.On Friday, Kishida's Cabinet approved a 770 billion yen ($6.8 billion) request for an extra defense budget through March to expedite the purchase of missiles, anti-submarine rockets and other weapons amid rising concern over the escalation of military activities by China, Russia and North Korea.The request, still pending parliamentary approval, is a record for an extra defense budget and will bring Japan’s military spending for the current year to a new high of more than 6.1 trillion yen ($53.2 billion), up 15% from 5.31 trillion yen in 2020. The combined budget for 2021 will be just over 1% of Japan’s GDP, keeping its customary cap.Kishida has said he is open to doubling Japan’s military spending to cope with the worsening security environment. Critics also say Japan, as the world’s fastest-aging country with a shrinking population, should allocate more money toward health care and other services.Compared to past troop reviews, which included 4,000 soldiers, more than 200 vehicles and dozens of warplanes, Saturday’s event was significantly scaled down to minimize the impact on regular troop activity, officials said. There was no parade or public viewing, and only nine tanks and other vehicles participated in the online event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japans-kishida-vows-to-counter-china-north-korea-threats-101638046920652.html

28-11-2021||India||States issue guidelines, review travel curbs over Omicron threat||Many state governments have issued fresh advisories to health officials and may reimpose restrictions on travel even as the central government on Sunday asked provincial authorities to be more vigilant against the new Omicron variant of the coronavirus. No cases of Omicron, dubbed a variant of concern by the World Health Organization last week, have been reported from India so far. The variant is spreading rapidly across the world, and there have been several instances reported from Africa, Europe and parts of Asia. The Uttar Pradesh health department on Sunday issued an advisory to all chief medical officers in the state, asking them to focus upon travellers coming from or transiting through countries where cases of the new variant have been reported, as well as their contacts. Travellers coming from ‘at risk’ nations should be rigorously screened and monitored according to guidelines of the Union health ministry, the advisory said. All incoming passengers from ‘at risk’ countries needed to tested. Those testing positive will have to stay in home isolation for 10 days and inform their health status to officials at the integrated Covid command centre, the advisory said. In Madhya Pradesh, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan held a high-level meeting on Sunday and said the state will prepare a list of people who have come to Madhya Pradesh from foreign countries in the past one month. “These people will be tested and also the suspects will be kept under observation. Genome sequencing h will also be done,” he said. Tamil Nadu’s health department has appointed nodal officers in each of the four international airports in the state (Chennai, Coimbatore, Madurai and Trichy) to coordinate with airport staff on screening and testing passengers on arrival. RT-PCR tests are being done for all international arrivals at Chennai airport. “We are monitoring those arriving from South Africa and transiting from there,” the state’s health minister M Subramanian told reporters on Saturday after inspecting Chennai airport.“With respect to Chennai airport, we are intensively monitoring passengers from South Africa, China, Hong Kong and Israel, and ensuring that they 100% home quarantined and (will) retest them after 8 days,” he said, adding that authorities will keep a record of passengers who have arrived after double vaccination. Since October 21, as many as 55,090 RT-PCR tests were conducted among passengers at Chennai airport, of which three tested positive for Covid-19. Most samples were of the Delta variant that swept through India in a devastating wave earlier this year. The Maharashtra government in a notification on Saturday said domestic air travellers will have to be either fully vaccinated or carry an RT-PCR test report valid for 72 hours. Simultaneously, all international passengers arriving at the city’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International airport from “countries of concern” will be made to undergo mandatory RT-PCR testing for Covid-19, and if found positive, will be sent to an institutional quarantine centre while their samples would be sent to the city’s genome sequencing lab, according to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). All passengers would have to provide their travel history of past 15 days on arrival, officials said. The BMC is also setting up a call centre for testing and institutional quarantine for international passengers.Karnataka has requested the central government to ban flights from South Africa, Hong Kong and Botswana, where the new strain has been found. It has made it mandatory that international travellers will be allowed to leave the airport only after testing negative for Covid-19. If they test positive, they will be quarantined. State authorities has increased vigil in the Kerala and Maharashtra borders, and only those who have negative test certificates with two doses of vaccines will be allowed to cross over into Karnataka, officials said.The Karnataka government has also issued an advisory asking schools and other educational institutions to suspend social and cultural events for two months. The government has said that people who work in malls, cinemas and other public spaces should not be allowed to report to their respective jobs until they get both shots of a Covid-19 vaccine. In Kerala, the government has stepped up surveillance in all four international airports and urged overseas visitors to undergo quarantine for seven days. “The state has taken all precautions as per the guidelines of the union health ministry. We will keep a strict tab on people who are on quarantine after coming from abroad,” said state health minister Veena George. Those coming from affected countries, including people with negative RT-PCR reports, will have to take a test again as they arrive in the state, she said.No advisories were issued in the states of Bihar, Punjab and West Bengal, even though officials there said they were monitoring the situation. “So far there is no case of omicron in Punjab. We are on an alert in case of any such case is found in the state. Testing is being increased at airports,” said Dr. Rajesh Bhaskar, Punjab’s nodal officer on the pandemic. “Though there is no such case in the state as of now, we are alert and will put in place whatever arrangements require to be done to contain it,” Bihar health minister Mangal Pandey told reporters in Madhubani on Saturday.West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, who is in charge of the state’s health department, has asked all officials to be on the alert. “The health secretary has convened an emergency meeting with chief medical officers from all state-run hospitals on Monday and a special cell is being opened at the infectious diseases hospital at Beliaghata in Kolkata,” the official said, requesting anonymity. Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar said on Sunday that “hope for the best and be prepared for the worst” and added that so far no such variant has surfaced in Haryana.The Odisha government has announced that people arriving in the state from foreign countries will have to undergo a mandatory quarantine for 10 days. “The foreign returnees will have to stay under quarantine for a period of 10 days to prevent further spread of Covid-19 infections in the state,” said Rama Raman Mohanty, director of medical education and training.Passengers from South Africa, Hong Kong and Botswana will be screened at the Biju Patnaik International Airport in order to curb the possible transmission of the Omicron variant of Covid-19. As Bhubaneswar is the entry point for international travellers in the state, there is a need for screening of passengers coming from South Africa, Hong Kong and Botswana, Mohanty said.As per the government’s revised guidelines against the new mutant, returnees will undergo a COVID-19 test at airports. Their swab samples will be sent for genome sequencing if anyone tests positive.In a video conference with district officials from Bhubaneswar on Sunday, chief secretary Suresh Chandra Mohapatra advised all block officials, ward members, and anganwadi and health workers to gather ground reports of Covid-19 infections in their areas and immediately take action if any cases are detected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-issue-guidelines-review-travel-curbs-over-omicron-threat-101638123509186.html
28-11-2021||India||The Week Ahead: Concerns over Omicron, GDP numbers to come||The Omicron conversation has just begun, and the big question that everyone is asking is, will the new variant — first reported by South African scientists to the World Health Organization (WHO) — create as much havoc as the Delta variant. It is quite likely that just as it happened on Saturday and Sunday, the discussion over Omicron and its possible effects on India will be discussed this week too. Meanwhile, India has another major question to tackle regarding Covid-19. The government’s expert panel, National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation, is likely to meet sometime next week to take up key issues regarding Covid-19 vaccination, including the matter of immunising children against Covid-19, a policy on administering booster dose, etc. This week is not going to be easy for public health policy experts and all those that are involved in creating the mechanism for India’s fight against the latest variant. The first and second waves saw the economy – and hence, the GDP – take a massive hit. Just when the numbers were showing a recovery, it is hoped that Omicron does not rock the boat. Data on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the July-September quarter, the central government’s monthly accounts and the index of eight core industries for October will be released on November 30. Goods and Services Tax (GST) collection figures for November – which correspond to transactions in October – will be released on December 1. November’s data on Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for manufacturing will also be released on December 1 and that for services will be released on December 3.GDP grew 20.1% in the June quarter. This has to be read with the fact that there was a 24.4% contraction in the June 2020 quarter because of a lockdown imposed to curb Covid-19 infections. June 2021 GDP was still below the pre-pandemic level: 9.2% less than the June 2019 quarter. Growth figures for the September quarter will similarly have to be read with the caveat that there was a 7.4% contraction in September 2020.The GDP data will show how India’s economy was recovering in the immediate aftermath of the second wave of the pandemic in the country. The rest of the indicators are of higher frequency and will show a more recent picture. Data from the Controller General of Accounts (CGA) showed that both revenue and capital expenditure of the central government had picked up pace in September. Year-on-year growth in revenue and capital expenditure was 45.7% and 83.1% in September. The corresponding numbers for the April-September period were 6.3% and 38.3%. GST collections were ₹1.3 lakh crore in October, the second highest since the tax was rolled out in 2017.Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) numbers similarly show recovery continuing. The PMI for manufacturing grew for the second consecutive month in October. It was 52.3 in August, 53.7 in September, and 55.9 in October. A PMI value above 50 signifies expansion in economic activity compared to the month before. Services PMI was 58.4 in October, the highest since July 2011.The index of eight core industries has however been moderating after July. In May, when the second wave peaked, it was 125.4, but increased to 134.7 by July. It had decreased to 126.7 in September. Year-on-year growth in the index was 4.4% in September compared to 11.5% in August. The states, too, are going to be busy. Kerala will move the Supreme Court this week questioning new RBI directives to regulate co-operative banks. It is another blow on federal structure, said CM Pinarayi Vijayan. The High Court is expected to take up Kerala education minister V Sivankutty and five others’ plea on Dec 2 pleading to discharge them from the assembly violence case. Election for lone RS seat on Monday and with ruling LDF enjoying brute majority in the assembly it would be cakewalk for Jose K Mani. Union home minister Amit Shah will visit Jaipur on December 5. Shah will address party‘s working committee meeting, and thereafter a mass gathering of elected representatives. Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot is expected to appoint close to a dozen parliamentary secretaries and also a list of political appointments. On November 30, Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma will inaugurate construction work of crucial Jorhat-Majuli bridge over the Brahmaputra river. Another important day for Assam will be when the regional committees to study border disputes between Assam and Meghalaya at six points along the interstate boundary to submit their reports. This week will see the anniversary of India’s worst ever industrial accident – Bhopal Gas Tragedy. The bigger tragedy? It’s been 37 years since the gas leak, but the survivors are waiting for their long-pending demand to be heard. In West Bengal, the BJP had moved a petition before the Calcutta high court demanding simultaneous civic polls across Bengal. The state election commission has gone ahead and declared polls in Kolkata on December 19. The High Court will take up the matter on Monday, November 29. All political parties will start campaigning for the Kolkata civic polls in the coming week with the BJP planning to declare its list of candidates on Sunday. Southwards, Tamil Nadu is preparing for another round of heavy rains as the IMD has forecast another low pressure to form on November 29.

They should not let their guard down under any circumstances,” Rao said.The director said a high alert had been sounded at the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport at Shamshabad, though there were no direct flights from South Africa to Hyderabad. The number of positive cases for Covid-19 was stable in the state and there was no sudden increase in infections, he said.“We have enough manpower at the airport and international passengers are being screened. We are also conducting RT-PCR tests at the airport and arrangements are also being made to keep passengers who test Covid-19 positive under 14-day quarantine. So far not a single Omicron case has been reported in India,” Rao said.He further said the state government had taken a series of measures to improve infrastructure like adding more hospital beds, developing medical oxygen lines to hospital beds and creating infrastructure for paediatric Covid-19 cases, across all government hospitals, so as to prepare for any possible third wave.On an average, Telangana has been witnessing 100-150 cases per day for the last few weeks. While 90 per cent of eligible individuals have received the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, 45 per cent have received the second dose.“Still, there are nearly 25 lakh people in Telangana who have missed-out on the second dose of the vaccine. They all should get their second dose of vaccine at the earliest,” the director of public health said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-on-high-alert-over-omicron-but-says-infra-in-place-to-tackle-possible-surge-101638122903457.html

To give equal water supply to the city and stop water leakages, PMC had decided to execute this project in 2018 with proposal including to shift the old water pipelines on almost 1,600km length and building more than 100 new water tanks to ensure equitable water supply to every household. However, the consultant of the project has already left the job and refused to work with Pune Municipal Corporation while the two contractors are appointed to do this work. The consultant, who was appointed against the consultation fee of ₹18 crore, pulled out in September citing delay in work. The consultant had the option of leaving the project due to force majeure as per a clause in the contract.Later two firms already roped in for executing the project Larsen & Toubro and another being Jain Irrigation were recently asked by civic body to carry forward the work. Earlier, the PMC had stopped the work of Jain Irrigation but as the company challenged this decision with arbitrator, who ruled in favour of private firm, the PMC reappointed the firm to carry out remaining work. ‘It is true that the work was undergoing at got slow pace few days ago mainly due to Covid-19 pandemic as there was a shortage of labours and material. Now the work is in progress and the construction for almost 70 to 80 water tanks has been completed. Even the 500km new water pipeline has also got laid with overall project is 40 per cent complete,” said Pune Mayor Murlidhar Mohol.The project’s original deadline is March 2023. With only 16 months remaining for the completion date, the project’s pace must be increased, observed opposition leaders. The project includes constructing 103 water tanks in various parts of the city. The PMC was raising funds through municipal bonds to implement the project that includes supply, installation, commissioning and operation of the 24x7 water supply system mainly to reduce water loss and ensure equitable water supply to the cityMohol said, “We had earlier stopped the contractor to do work due to delay. But as he challenged the decision, which came in his favor, PMC appointed him again. For such mega projects, many hurdles came when actual work starts and we are overcoming on it, step by step.” According to PMC executive engineer Nandkishor Jagtap who is in charge for this project, even as consultant has left the job but, it would not affect the work. “We have all the drawings with us. Now the progress of work is good.” Opposition parties Congress and Nationalist Congress Party have raised objections on this project and the delay that is being caused. NCP city unit president Prashant Jagtap said, “Many water tanks have still not been linked with water connections. Even after laying water pipeline, the roads were not reinstated properly.”Recently standing committee chairman Hemant Rasne had organized the municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar’s visit at Laxmi Road and other peth areas and pointed out errors in the works. Congress leader Aba Bagul blamed that on pilot basis the water meters are installed but they are not working.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/launched-with-much-fanfare-pmc-s-24x7-water-project-runs-into-work-flow-trouble-101638115701291.html

The continued incursions by China and the response of NDA/ BJP Government to them do form a substantial part of my book," Tewari tweeted.Chowdhury had earlier slammed Tewari for criticising the then United Progressive Alliance government for its response to the 26/11 Mumbai terror strike in his upcoming book '10 Flash Points; 20 Years - National Security Situations that Impacted India'.Chowdhury said, "instead of the 26/11 attacks, Tewari should focus on China and its recent activities along the country's border.""He (Manish Tewari) should be focusing more on China that has captured many of our areas in Ladakh and built villages in Arunachal Pradesh," Chowdhury said to ANI.An expert from Tewari's upcoming book reads: "For a state that has no compunctions in brutally slaughtering hundreds of innocent people, restraint is not a sign of strength; it is perceived as a symbol of weakness. There comes a time when actions must speak louder than words. 26/11 was one such time when it just should have been done," an excerpt from the book read."It, therefore, is my considered opinion that India should have actioned a kinetic response in the days following India's 9/11," it added.Citing Tewari's book, BJP had earlier launched an attack on Congress and stated that the excerpts from the publication show that the then UPA government was insensitive, useless and was even not concerned about national security.Mumbai had come to a standstill on November 26, 2008, when 10 Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorists who entered the city via sea route from Pakistan carried out a series of coordinated shootings and bombings that injured over 300 and claimed the lives of 166 people in India's financial capital.The attacks took place at Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CST) railway station, Cama Hospital, Nariman House business and residential complex, Leopold Cafe, Taj Hotel and Tower and the Oberoi-Trident Hotel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-leader-manish-tewari-criticises-fellow-partyman-chowdhury-on-twitter-101638112496212.html

The authority would prepare the detailed project report once the greenfield alignment is approved by the Bihar government, said a senior officer familiar with the proposal. Chief general manager, NHAI, Patna regional office, Sadre Alam said that they had submitted the portion of alignment of Gorakhpur-Siliguri expressway, passing through various districts of Bihar, to the road construction department (RCD) for discussion and approval early this month. “A formal discussion with senior RCD officials is, however, awaited,” said Alam. RCD minister Nitin Nabin said the proposal to build a new 650km expressway from Gorakhpur to Siliguri was in the initial stage of implementation. “It is great to know that the Union ministry of road transport and highways has been keen to boost road infrastructure in the state. If the proposal gets the Centre’s approval, the people of Bihar would benefit from it. It would ease the vehicular traffic from east to west part of the state,” said Nabin. A senior officer of NHAI said that around 450km stretch of the proposed expressway of four/six-lane configuration would pass through Bihar. It will be part of the Bharatmala project. “As proposed, the road will enter Bihar from Gopalganj and exist from Kishanganj, crisscrossing Siwan, Chapra, Muzaffarpur, Sitamarhi, Madhubani, Supaul, Saharsa and Purnia. The NHAI has gone ahead with the proposal after the MoRTH gave its nod to the project,” said the officer, adding that estimated spending on this project could be around ₹6000 crore. Once executed, this would be the fourth expressway that would benefit the people of Bihar. Earlier, the RCD started land acquisition for the Amas-Darghanga expressway, while the proposal for two expressways—from Buxar to Bhagalpur, and from Raxaul to Kolkata via Patna - are under different stages of clearance with the Central government. RCD officials said that the Gorakhpur-Siliguri expressway proposal might be discussed during the meeting of state RCD minister Nabid with Central minister Nitin Gadkari in New Delhi on December 6. They said that the state government has also listed the issues affecting the construction of Munger-Mirjachauki via Bhagalpur highways and strengthening of Ram-Janki Path (from Sitamarhi to Janakpur in Nepal), which is part of the Ramayana Circuit in Bihar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nhai-proposes-gorakhpur-siliguri-expressway-awaits-bihar-s-nod-101638110781940.html

Otherwise, January 26 (Republic Day) is not far, and 4 lakh tractors & farmers all are there." pic.twitter.com/sBMoJ9N1rITikait made the statement ahead of a kisan mahapanchayat organised in Mumbai wherein farmer leaders called for the defeat of the BJP in all the upcoming assembly elections, while vowing to continue the fight for an MSP law. The farmer leaders also reiterated their other demands, including withdrawal of the Electricity Amendment bill and arrest of Union minister Ajay Mishra over the Lakhimpur Kheri violence.The mega conclave of farmers was held under the banner of Samyukta Shetkari Kamgar Morcha (SSKM) at Azad Maidan in south Mumbai on the eve of the beginning of the Parliament session. At the gathering, Tikait said the central government was cheating the farmers and there was a need to remain alert. “The government is yet to come to talking terms. This regime is dishonest and deceitful. It wants to show the farming and labour communities in bad light,” the farmer leader was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.  He further said Prime Minister Narendra Modi was a supporter of the MSP when he was the chief minister of Gujarat and wanted a nationwide law to ensure that farmers' interests were guaranteed.Accusing the Modi government of running away from a debate over the issue, he said, "The Centre should bring a law to guarantee MSP to farmers. There are several issues related to the agriculture and labour sectors that need attention and we will travel all over the country to highlight them," he said.Tikait also demanded that financial aid be given to the kin of farmers who died in the year-long protest against the Centre's three agri marketing laws.The mahapanchayat, held on the occasion of the death anniversary of social reformer Jyotiba Phule, hailed the farmers' victory over the Centre withdrawing the three farm laws and vowed to fight for remaining demands, a press release said.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rday-not-far-tractors-farmers-present-rakesh-tikait-s-warning-on-msp-law-101638104393113.html

Conferences, seminars, academic events, etc. in educational institutions, wherever possible, may be postponed. Alternatively, it could be conducted in hybrid mode i.e. with minimal physical attendance and with more persons attending through virtual mode,” according to the advisory issued by TK Anil Kumar, the additional chief secretary of the health and family welfare department on Sunday.The order came at a time when the Bommai government was relaxing restrictions in schools and other places to bring back some semblance of normalcy after almost 18 months of pandemic-induced lockdowns.The new restrictions apprehending the possibility of a third wave of infections have sparked fears among the population who are apprehensive of more lockdowns that would bring on the burden of financial hardships and endanger their livelihoods.The Bommai government had gone ahead and resumed physical classes for pre-primary students from November, despite opposition from various quarters including a significant section of parents and guardians who were apprehensive of the move since the children who are not eligible for vaccination are vulnerable and may contract the coronavirus that remains just as potent as it was at the beginning of last year.In the wake of the new Covid-19 variant ‘Omicron’ that has been detected in South Africa, the state government on Saturday made it mandatory for people arriving from affected countries to take the RT-PCR test upon landing in the city. Home quarantine has also been made mandatory for these passengers.“Earlier international passengers were tested but asked to go home and quarantine themselves. Now test them there itself (airport) and allow them to leave after they test negative,” Bommai said on Sunday.The Karnataka government on Saturday reintroduced restrictions and issued fresh directives including making it mandatory for people working in malls, cinemas and other public places to be allowed in only if they have been vaccinated with both shots of the Covid-19 vaccine.Bommai on Sunday said that these new strains were found in South Africa, Botswana and Hong Kong but there were no cases detected so far in Karnataka.“We haven’t seen that strain in Karnataka but in places like Dharward, Mysuru and Bengaluru hostels we have seen spurts of cases spreading rapidly making them clusters. We have to take precautions,” Bommai said.He said that these hostels have been declared as containment zones with restrictions imposed and directions to increase testing on the premises.“Health care professionals may also conduct conferences, seminars, CME sessions, etc., virtually for a few more months to send a positive message to professionals in other fields, in the larger interest of public health,” Sunday’s advisory by the government read.The Karnataka government had also eased restrictions on several other fronts, allowing for the organising of fairs.The Bommai government continues the practice of imposing restrictions on the public even as electioneering for the December 10 MLC polls continues unchecked.Bommai said that for the MLC elections there are no big public meetings and that only about 50-100 people are present. However, he said that all people attending these meeting should follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour.Bommai said that measures were being taken to increase vaccination coverage. He said that there were around 80 lakh Covid-19 vaccine doses available in the state and around 91% of the eligible population were administered at least one dose but conceded that this was reaching saturation levels. He said that around 58% of the population had received both doses and the government will aggressively pursue measures to increase coverage to at least 70% by the end of the year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fresh-curbs-on-karnataka-schools-as-fears-of-third-wave-of-covid-19-loom-large-101638101900277.html

The opposition TMC and CPI(M) failed to open their account in the AMC: State Election CommissionThe party also swept the 25-ward Dharmanagar Municipal Council, 15-seat Teliamura Municipal Council and 13-member Amarpur Nagar Panchayat. In the Sonamura Nagar Panchayat and Melaghar Nagar Panchayat, the BJP won all the 13 seats.The BJP also bagged the 11-member Jirania Nagar Panchayat. The party secured 12 seats of Ambassa Municipal Council, while the TMC and the CPI-M won one seat each and another went to an independent candidate. The BJP also won 16 seats of Kailashahar Municipal Council where the CPI(M) got one. In Panisagar Nagar Panchayat, the BJP emerged victorious in 12 seats, while the CPI(M) bagged one.The saffron party had fielded candidates for all the 334 seats of Agartala Municipal Corporation, 13 municipal bodies and six Nagar Panchayats in the state where its nominees won in 112 places uncontested.Elections to 222 seats were held on November 25. The ruling BJP is locked in a battle with the Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress, which is foraying into the northeast and elsewhere to establish itself as a national party, and with the CPI(M), which the saffron camp had dethroned from power in the state some years ago.The TMC, which alleged vote-rigging and intimidation in the elections, had demanded countermanding of the entire polls. The CPI(M) had sought fresh elections in five municipal bodies, including the AMC. Both parties had claimed that the authorities remained silent spectators as BJP supporters attacked political rivals and rigged the elections. The saffron camp, however, denied the charges.Reacting to the party’s performance, BJP vice president Dilip Ghosh said in Kolkata the results of Tripura civic polls have exposed the "hollowness" of TMC's claims of having made inroads into the northeastern state. He said people there have faith in the saffron party.Describing TMC workers campaigning in Tripura as "hired people", Ghosh told reporters his party shares a "strong bond" with the residents of that state. "The civic poll results are on expected lines. The TMC did not have any chance to open its account in Tripura, they only made noises. This verdict shows hired people from West Bengal cannot help a party create a base in a state, which has faith in the BJP," Ghosh added.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-sweeps-tripura-civic-polls-tmc-cpi-m-fail-to-open-account-in-most-bodies-101638099732559.html

Higher education minister K Ponmudi has written a letter to IIT-Madras director Bhaskar Ramamurthi on the issue.The state minister has asked him to ensure that the state’s invocation song (Tamil Thai Vazhthu) is played by the institute during all its functions. The minister in his letter dated November 24, said, “...it is disheartening to learn that in the recently concluded convocation the State Invocation Song “Tamil Thai Vazhthu” was not sung in the event, a deviation of the well-established protocol.”The song, written by scholar Manonmaniam Pillai and set to tune by musician MS Viswanathan, is played at the beginning of all government functions in the state and the national anthem is played at the end of the function. “I would like to point out that the invocation song is sung in all the state and Central government functions in Tamil Nadu including the functions where higher dignitaries, like (the) President of India and Prime the Minister participate,” Ponmudi said in his letter. “I, therefore, request you to ensure that the “Tamil Thai Vazhthu” invocation is sung in all the functions of the institution including convocation in future.”IIT-M held its 58th convocation virtually on November 20 in which Olympic badminton medallist PV Sindhu was the chief guest. 1,962 students graduated and as many as 2,425 degrees, including joint and dual degrees, were awarded to students on the occasion. It included the highest number of PhDs awarded in an academic year – 392.Ponmudi went on to point out that IIT-M was established in 1959 in 250 hectares of land provided by the then state government of Tamil Nadu. “From that time onwards, the Government of Tamil Nadu has been contributing through various means for the growth and development of the institution and the present government is also very keen on continuing the same support,” he said. He added that IIT-M has recently written a letter to the Principal Secretary to Government, Higher Education Department seeking ₹10 crores support from the state government to establish a National Facility for Cryo-Electron Microscopy which is currently under examination.In 2018, a controversy broke out after a video showed the junior Sankaracharya of Kanchi Mutt, Vijayendra Saraswati, sitting through the state’s song at an event in Chennai which was criticised by present chief minister M K Stalin who was then the opposition leader of the DMK.

The number of women respondents is high in Telangana where as much as 84% respondents felt such behaviour is fair.More than 81.09% male respondents from Karnataka justified beating their wives compared to 14.2% in Himachal Pradesh.Amita Pitre, lead specialist, Gender Justice: Oxfam India while speaking to news agency PTI said that the organisation while working with women found that harmful gender social norms help justify violence against women and girls. “All the reasons cited to justify violence on women are a product of these norms: if she neglects the house or children, if she refuses to have sex with the husband, if she doesn't cook food properly. All these define how women should behave in society,” Pitre was quoted as saying by news agency PTI. Pitre highlighted that it is important that women move away from such men if gender-based violence against women has to stop.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/survey-shows-30-women-across-14-states-uts-justify-men-beating-their-wives-101638095695758.html

Karnataka Association of Resident Doctors (KARD) said in a release that resident doctors will be withdrawing all the elective services including outpatient departments (OPDs) and elective operation theatres (OTs) in all the medical colleges affiliated with it.The association has reiterated its three-point demand, urging the government to consider restructuring the academic fees according to the 2018-19 academic year; payment of Covid-risk allowance; and timely payment of stipend to postgraduates and interns.In May, the Karnataka government announced a Covid allowance of ₹10,000 per month from April 2021 for all resident doctors. The association said that the funds have not been released by the government even after six months, terming it a "blatant disregard" towards the doctors serving on the frontlines.Highlighting an almost 400% hike in academic fees, the association stated that matter was made even worse by forcing them to pay up the entire sum upfront without any concession during “these troubling times”. It added that innumerable symbolic protests, letters to concerned authorities and a pan-state protest bore no fruitful result.“It is unfortunate to note that the assurance given by Minister of medical education has not been fulfilled. The intent to address the issue is clearly not visible as resident doctors were excluded from the package of Covid-risk allowance announced recently by Government of Karnataka," the statement read."We are left with no option but to display our dissent in this regard with a PAN-KARNATAKA indefinite strike from NOV 29th 2021, comprising of withdrawal of all the elective services including OPDs and Elective OTs (Excluding emergency services) in all the medical colleges affiliated with KARD,” it added.KARD is an association of house surgeons, postgraduates, and super speciality residents of government medical and dental colleges in Karnataka.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-resident-doctors-call-for-indefinite-strike-from-nov-29-over-3-point-demand-101638094924024.html

They would ask the person to take up a job instead for job security, salary and a hassle- free existence. However, today if someone wants to start a company, people around are excited and supportive. People today are trying to become job creators not just job seekers,“ he said. The PM also referred to BR Ambedkar’s anniversary on December 6 and said discharge of our duties will be a fitting tribute to him.“Babasaheb Ambedkar devoted his entire life to discharging his duties for the country and society. We must never forget that the basic spirit of our Constitution expects all of us to discharge our duties. So let us take a pledge that in the Amrit Mahotsav we will try to fulfil our duties with full devotion; this will be a tribute to Baba Saheb,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pmmodi-lauds-growth-of-start-ups-in-india-on-mann-ki-baat-101638083778739.html
28-11-2021||India||On Mann Ki Baat, Modi salutes ‘brave sons and mothers’ of India’s defence sectors. Read full text of 83rd episode here||Addressing the nation on his monthly radio programme ‘Mann Ki Baat’, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday saluted India’s armed forces ahead of the 50th-anniversary celebrations of the 1971 war which will take place next month. Notably, this is the second last ‘Mann Ki Baat’ episode of the year.Speaking on the 83rd episode of his 'Mann Ki Baat' radio programme, the prime minister threw light on the significance of places like Jhansi and Bundelkhand in India's freedom struggle. Modi also talked about how India is a “leader in the field of start-ups, highlighting the rise in the number of unicorn firms in the country.Here’s the full speech:My dear countrymen, Namaskar. We are connecting once again today for Mann Ki Baat. Two days later, the month of December is commencing…and with the onset of December, we psychologically feel “O…the year has concluded!” This is the last month of the year and one starts sketching out plans for the New Year. This month itself, the country also celebrates Navy Day and Armed Forces Flag Day. All of us know that on the 16th of December, the country is also celebrating the golden jubilee of the 1971 War. On all these occasions, I remember the country’s Armed Forces…I remember our brave hearts. And especially, I remember the brave mothers who give birth to such bravehearts. As always, this time too, I have received numerous suggestions from all of you on the Namo App and MyGov. Considering me to be a part of your family, you have also shared your lives’ joys and sorrows. In that, there are many young people; students as well! I really feel good for the fact that this Mann Ki Baat family of ours is continually growing…connecting with hearts and connecting through goals too. And our ever deepening bonds are creating a surge of a flow of constant positivity within us.My dear countrymen, Ojaswi from Sitapur has written to me that he enjoys discussions touching upon the Amrit Mahotsav, a lot. He listens to Mann Ki Baat with his friends and is continuously trying to know and learn more about the Freedom Struggle. Friends, the Amrit Mahotsav, along with learning, also inspires us to do something for the country. And now, throughout the country, whether it’s common folk or governments; from Panchayats to Parliament, the resonance of the Amrit Mahotsav is palpable…programmes in connection with the Mahotsav are going on successively. One such interesting programme was held in Delhi recently. In the programme, ‘Azadi Ki Kahani – Bachchon Ki Zubani’, children narrated stories connected with the Freedom Struggle from the core of their hearts. The special element in that was – along with India, students from Nepal, Mauritius, Tanzania, New Zealand and Fiji too participated in that activity. Our country’s Maharatna, ONGC too is celebrating the Amrit Mahotsav in a slightly different manner. These days, ONGC is organizing study tours to oil fields for our students. In these tours, youth are being imparted knowledge on ONGC’s Oil Field Operations…with the objective that our budding engineers be able to contribute their bit to nation building efforts with full zest and fervor.Friends, keeping in view the contribution of our tribal communities in attaining Freedom, the country has also celebrated the ‘Janajati Gaurav Saptah’. Across different regions of the country, programmes related to that were held. In the Andaman-Nicobar archipelago, people from tribal communities such as Jarwa and Onge vibrantly displayed their culture. Miniature Writer Ram Kumar Joshi ji from Una, Himachal Pradesh too has done some remarkable work…on tiny postage stamps, he has drawn outstanding sketches of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri. On the word ‘Ram’ written in Hindi, a brief biography of both the great men has been inscribed. Some friends from Katni, Madhya Pradesh have conveyed information on a memorable Dastangoi, story-telling programme. In that, memories of the indomitable courage and sacrifice of Rani Durgavati have been rekindled. One such programme took place in Kashi. A three-day Festival was organized in honour of illustrious luminaries such as Goswami Tulsidas, Sant Kabir, Sant Ravidas, Bharatendu Harishchandra, Munshi Premchand and Jaishankar Prasad. In different periods, all of them played a major role in fostering public awakening in the country. You might be aware…in the last episodes of Mann Ki Baat, I had referred to three competitions – one was on writing patriotic songs; one on drawing Rangolis on events connected with patriotic fervor and the Freedom movement and one on scripting lullabies that nurture dreams of a grand India in the minds of our children. I hope that you certainly must have sent in your entries too for these competitions…you must have made plans as well…you must have discussed it among friends too! I hope you will promote this programme in every corner of India with wholehearted enthusiasm.My dear countrymen, in this discussion, I now straightaway take you to Vrindavan. It is said about Vrindavan that it is a tangible manifestation of God’s love. Our saints too have remarked:“Yeh aasa dhari chitta mein, yeh aasa dhari chitta meinKahat jathaa mati morVrindavan sukh rang kau, Vrindavan sukh rang kauKaahu na payau aur”Meaning, We all refer to the glory of Vrindavan, according to our own capabilities…but the inner joy of Vrindavan, its inherent spirit…nobody can attain it in its entirety…it is infinite. That is exactly why Vrindavan has been attracting people from all over the world. You will find its mark in every corner of the world.There is a city in Western Australia – Perth. Cricket lovers must be well acquainted with the place since cricket matches are often held there. In Perth, there is an art gallery called Sacred India Gallery. This gallery has been set up in the beautiful region of Swan Valley and it is the result of the efforts of a resident of Australia Jagat Tarini Dasi ji. Jagat Tarini ji is actually an Australian…born and brought up there, but she came to Vrindavan and spent more than 13 years here. She says that though she returned to Australia…came back to her own country…but she could never forget Vrindavan. That’s why, in order to stay spiritually connected with Vrindavan, she created Vrindavan in Australia itself. Making her art a medium, she set up a marvelous Vrindavan.. People who come here get an opportunity to view myriad artefacts. They get to see glimpses of the most famous pilgrimage centres of India – the traditions and culture of Vrindavan, Navaadweep and Jagannathpuri. Here, many an artwork related to the life of Bhagwan Shrikrishna has been exhibited. There is an artifact as well, that displays the Govardhan Parvat, held aloft by Bhagwan Shrikrishna on his little finger, with people of Vrindavan taking refuge beneath. Indeed, this matchless endeavour on part of Jagat Tarini ji brings to the fore the power of Krishna-Bhakti. I extend my best wishes on this effort of hers.My dear countrymen, I was just referring to the subject of Vrindavan, built at Perth, Australia. There’s an interesting history as well…in that, Australia shares a bond with our Jhansi, Bundelkhand. Actually, when the Queen of Jhansi Laxmibai was fighting a legal battle against the East India Company, her lawyer was John Lang. John Lang was originally a resident of Australia. Staying in India, he fought Rani Laxmibai’s case. All of us know of the huge contribution of Jhansi and Bundelkhand in our Fight for Freedom. Veeranganas, brave hearts such as Rani Laxmibai and Jhalkaribai hailed from here…this region has given to the country legendary sports persons like Major Dhyanchand too.Friends, it is not necessary that bravery should be displayed only on the battlefield. When bravery becomes a vow and it expands, then many feats start getting accomplished in every field. Mrs. Jyotsna has written a letter to me about very such valor. There was a traditional river in Jalaun – Noon River. Noon, used to be the main source of water for the farmers here, but gradually the Noon river reached the verge of extinction, the little existence that was left of this river, in that it was turning into a drain. Due to this, problems in irrigation had also arisen for the farmers. The people of Jalaun took the initiative to change this situation. This very year in March, a committee was formed for this. Thousands of villagers and local people spontaneously volunteered to join this campaign. The panchayats here started working together with the villagers, and today in such a short time, and at a very low cost, the river has come back to life again. So many farmers are benefiting from this! Apart from the battlefield, this example of bravery shows the determination of our countrymen, and it also tells that if we take a resolve, nothing is impossible and that is why I say - ‘Sabka Prayas’...everyone's effort.My dear countrymen, when we conserve nature, in return nature also gives us protection and security. We experience this in our personal life as well and one such example has been presented by the people of Tamil Nadu on a large scale. This is the example of Thoothukudi district of Tamil Nadu. We know that coastal areas are many a time prone to land submersion. There were many such small islands and islets in Thoothukudi too, which were increasingly in danger of submerging in the sea. The people here and the experts found the mitigation from this natural disaster through nature itself. These people are now planting Palmyra trees on these islands. These trees stand firm even in cyclones and storms and give protection to the soil. Through this now a new confidence has arisen in saving this area.Friends, nature poses a threat to us only when we disturb her balance or destroy her sanctity. Nature nurtures us like a Mother and fills our world with vivid colors too.I have been watching on social media the picture of a flying boat in Meghalaya that is becoming viral. This picture catches our attention at the very first sight itself. Most of you must have certainly seen it online. When we look closely at this boat floating in the air, we come to know that it is moving on the river water. The water of the river is so clear that we can see its bed and the boat seems to be floating in the air. There are many states in our country ; there are many areas where people have preserved the colors of their natural heritage. These people have kept the lifestyle of living in harmony with nature alive even today. This is an inspiration to all of us too. Whatever natural resources are around us, we should save them, bring them back to their actual form. In this lies the interests of all of us ; interests of the world.My dear countrymen, when the government makes plans, spends the budget, completes the projects on time, people feel that it is working. But in the many works of the government, amidst the many schemes of development, things related to human sensitivities always give a different kind of joy. With the efforts of the government, with the schemes of the government, the way a life changed... what is the experience of that changed life? When we hear this, we too are filled with empathy. It also gives satisfaction to the mind and gives inspiration too to take that scheme to the people. In a way, it is just 'Swant: Sukhay', joy to one’s own soul and that is why today in "Mann Ki Baat" two such friends are also joining us who have won a new life through their zeal. They got their treatment done with the help of Ayushman Bharat scheme and have started a new life. Our first friend is Rajesh Kumar Prajapati who had an ailment of the heart - heart disease.So let's talk to Rajesh ji -Prime Minister - Rajesh ji Namaste.Rajesh Prajapati – Namaste Sir Namaste.Prime Minister - What was your disease Rajesh ji? You must have gone to some doctor, just explain to me what the local doctor must have said... you must have also gone to some other doctor? Then you would not have been able to take the decision or would have taken, what all used to happen?Rajesh Prajapati – Ji the problem was with my heart Sir. I used to have a burning sensation in the chest, Sir, then I showed it to the doctor. The doctor at first said “Son, maybe you have acid”... so I got treatment for acid quite some time, when I did not benefit from it, then showed it to Dr. Kapoor, then he said son, the symptoms you have will become clear by angiography, then he referred me to ShriRam Murthy. Then we met Amresh Agarwal ji, so he did my angiography. Then he said “Son, there is blockage in your vein”, so I said sir, how much will it cost? Then he said that there is a card of Ayushman which PM ji made. Then I said sir, I have it with me. Then he took that card of mine and all my treatment has been done with that card. Sir and this card that you have made in a very good way and for us poor people is very convenient. And how can I thank you!Prime Minister - What do you do Rajesh ji?Rajesh Prajapati - Sir, presently I am doing a private job. SirPrime Minister - And how old are you?Rajesh Prajapati - I am forty nine years old, Sir.Prime Minister - You got heart trouble at such a young age?Rajesh Prajapati - Yes sir what to say now!Prime Minister – In your family, earlier did your father or mother have such a thing?Rajesh Prajapati - No sir, nobody had sir, this has happened first with me only.Prime Minister - This Ayushman card, Government of India gives this card. This is a big scheme for the poor, so how did you come to know of it?Rajesh Prajapati - Sir, this is such a big scheme, poor people get a lot of benefit from it and are so happy sir. I have seen in the hospital how many facilities people get from this card when they tell the doctor that they have the card. Sir, the doctor then says, okay bring that card and I will treat you with the same card.Prime Minister – Ok, if you did not have the card, how much expenses the doctor had told you?Rajesh Prajapati - The doctor had said that son, it will cost a lot if the card is not there. So I said sir, I have the card, so he asked me to show it immediately, so I showed it immediately. All my treatment was done with the same card, not a single penny of mine was spent, all the medicines have also been issued through the same card.Prime Minister - So Rajesh ji, you are satisfied now, your health is fine?Rajesh Prajapati - Sir, thank you very much sir, may you live so long that you always remain in power and our family members are also happy with you, what to say!Prime Minister: Rajesh ji, don't wish me for being in power, I am not in power even today and I don't want to be in power in future also. I only want to be in service; for me this post, this Prime Ministership, all these things are not at all for power, brother, they are for service.Rajesh Prajapati: Service is what we need... what else!Prime Minister: See this Ayushman Bharat scheme for the poor in itself…Rajesh Prajapati: Yes Sir, it is a very nice thingPrime Minister: But see Rajesh ji, you do one thing for us, will you?Rajesh Prajapati: Yes, absolutely Sir!Prime Minister: See what happens - people do not know about it, you should take on a duty, find out how many poor families are around you, and how you benefited from it, how did you get help? Do tell them!Rajesh Prajapati: Will absolutely tell Sir.Prime Minister: And do tell them that they should also get such a card made because the family does not know when a problem may come and it is not right that the poor remain bothered on account of medicines today. Now, because of money they do not take medicine or do not seek the remedy of the disease then it is also a matter of great concern, and what happens to the poor as you’ve had this heart problem, for many months you would not have been able to work.Rajesh Prajapati: I could not walk ten steps, I could not climb stairs Sir.Prime Minister: So Rajesh ji, by becoming a good friend of mine, you can explain this Ayushman Bharat scheme to as many poor people as you can. By the way, you can help the sick people, see you will also be satisfied and I will be very happy that come on Rajesh ji's health not only became fine but Rajesh ji got the health of hundreds of people better. This Ayushman Bharat scheme, it is for the poor, it is for the middle class, it is for the common families, so this information must be conveyed to every house by You !Rajesh Prajapati: Will definitely convey Sir. I stayed there for three days in the hospital, Sir, so many poor people came to the hospital and told them about all the facilities ; if there is a card, it will be done for free.Prime Minister: Alright, Rajesh ji, keep yourself healthy, worry a little about your body, take care of the children and wish you a lot of progress. I wish you all the best.Friends, we listened to Rajesh ji, now Sukh Devi ji is joining us. A knee problem had bothered her a lot, let us first listen from Sukhdevi ji about her plight and then how succour came to her, let us understandModi ji - Sukhdevi ji Namaste! Where are you speaking from?Sukhdevi ji - from Danadpara.Modi ji - Where does this lie?Sukhdevi ji - in Mathura.Modi ji - In Mathura, then Sukhdevi ji, one has to say Namaste and say Radhe-Radhe as well!Sukhdevi ji - Yes, Radhe-Radhe!Modi ji - Well I heard that you were suffering. Have you had any operation? Can you tell what is the matter?Sukhdevi ji - Yes, my knee was damaged, so I have had an operation in Prayag Hospital |Modi ji - how old are you Sukhdevi ji?Sukhdevi ji – My age is 40 years.Modi ji - 40 years ! And named Sukhdevi ! And Sukhdevi got sick?Sukhdevi ji – I got sick when I was about 15-16 years old.Modi ji - OMG! Your knees got affected at such a young age?Sukhdevi ji – What is that called.. arthritis – gout pain in the joints, the knee got worse due to that.Modi ji - So from the age of 16 to 40, you did not get treatment for this?Sukhdevi ji - No, it was treated. Small time doctors who kept on giving medicine for pain, this is that desi medicine, this is that medicine. Quacks! I was able to walk with them but the knees got worse, I had only walked 1-2 kilometers and then my knees got worse.Modi ji - So Sukhdevi ji how did the idea of ​​ operation come about? How did you manage the money for it? How did all of this happen?Sukhdevi ji - I have got the treatment done with the Ayushman card.Modi ji - So you had got an Ayushman card?Sukhdevi ji - Yes.Modi ji - And there is free treatment for the poor with Ayushman card.

From there, my husband came to know and he got the card made in my name.Modi ji - Yes.Sukhdevi ji - Then I got the treatment done by card, and I did not spend any money. I have been treated by the card itself. It has been a great treatment.Modi ji – Good. If there was no card, how much cost did the doctor say earlier?Sukhdevi ji - 2.5 lakh rupees, three lakh rupees. For 6-7 years I’ve been on the cot! I used to say that oh God call me, I don’t want to live!Modi ji : you were on the cot for 6-7 years! Good God!Sukhdevi ji - Yes.Modi ji - Oho!Sukhdevi ji – Couldn’t get up at all!Modi ji - So now your knee is better than before?Sukhdevi ji - I walk around a lot. I roam! I do kitchen work!

Sukhdevi ji, I wish you all the very best, Radhe-Radhe to you once again.Sukhdevi ji - Radhe - Radhe, Namaste!My dear countrymen, in every country with a large youth population, three aspects matter a lot. Sometimes, it becomes the true identity of the youth. The first aspect is - Ideas and Innovation. The second is the spirit of taking risks and the third is the Can Do Spirit, that is, the determination to accomplish any task, no matter how adverse the circumstances be - when these three things combine, phenomenal results are produced, miracles happen. These days, all we hear about from every corner is about Start-up, Start-up, Start-up. It is true, this is the era of start-up, and it is also true that in the world of start-up, India is leading in a way in the world today. Start-ups are getting record investment year after year. This sector is progressing very fast. The reach of start-ups has increased even in small towns of the country. These days the word 'Unicorn' is in vogue. You all must have heard about it. 'Unicorn' is a start-up whose valuation is at least 1 Billion Dollars, that is more than about seven thousand crore rupees.Friends, till the year 2015, there used to be hardly nine or ten Unicorns in the country. You will be very happy to know that now India is flying high even in the world of Unicorns. According to a report, a big change has come this year. In just 10 months, a unicorn is being raised in India every 10 days. This is also a big thing because our youth have achieved this success in the midst of the corona pandemic. Today there are more than 70 Unicorns in India. That is, there are more than 70 start-ups that have crossed the valuation of more than 1 billion. Friends, due to the success of Start-Ups, everyone has noticed them and the way they are getting support from investors from all over the country and abroad. Perhaps, just a few years ago no one could have imagined this happening.Friends, Indian youth are also contributing to the solution of global problems through start-ups. Today we will talk to a young Mayur Patil, he along with his friends have tried to put forward a solution to the problem of pollution.Modi ji - Mayur ji Namaste.Mayur Patil - Namaste Sir ji.Modi ji - Mayur ji how are you?Mayur Patil - Just fine sir. How are you ?Modi ji - I am very happy. Ok tell me...You are in the start-up world.Mayur Patil - JiModi ji - and doing the ‘best’ out of the ‘waste’...Mayur Patil - JiModi ji - And for the environment too, tell me a little about yourself. Tell us about your work and how did you get the idea behind this work?Mayur Patil - Sir, I had a motorcycle when I was in college. Its mileage was extremely low and emissions were very high. It was a two stroke motorcycle. Thus, in order to reduce the emissions and increase its mileage by a bit, I started trying. Sometime in 2011-12, I managed to increase the mileage by about 62 kilometres per liter. From there, I got the inspiration to make something that can be mass produced, so that it can be of benefit to many people. So, in 2017-18 we developed its technology and used it in 10 buses of the Regional Transport Corporation. We then checked the results and found that we managed to reduce emissions by forty percent in these buses.Modi ji - Hmm! Now this technology which you have developed, have you got its patent registered?Mayur Patil - Haan Ji! It has been patented. This year, it came to us through a patent grant.Modi ji - And what is your plan to scale it further? How are you doing that? With the result of the buses being received, many other pieces of information must have come out too. What are you thinking of next?Mayur Patil - Sir, under the aegis of Start-Up India..NITI Aayog has launched the Atal New India Challenge. From there we got the grant and on the basis of that grant, we just started our factory where we can manufacture air filters.Modi ji - So how much grant did you get from the Government of India?Mayur Patil – 90 LakhsModi Ji – 90 LakhsMayur Patil - JiModi ji - and your work is done with it.Mayur Patil - Yes, it has started now. It is in the process.Modi ji - How many of your friends are doing all of this together?Mayur Patil - We are four people Sir.Modi ji - And all four used to study together earlier and from that you got an idea to move forward?Mayur Patil - Ji! Ji! We were still in college. And in college we thought about all of this and it was my idea that I should at least reduce the pollution of my motorcycle and increase the mileage.Modi ji - Ok, so if we reduce pollution and increase mileage, how much is the average money that can be saved?Mayur Patil – Sir, we tested the mileage on the motorcycle, and increased its mileage from 25 Kilometers per liter to 39 Kilometers per liter, that is there was a gain of about 14 kilometers... And 40 percent carbon emissions were reduced. When we tested on the Regional Transport Corporation buses, there was an increase in fuel efficiency by 10 percent and the emissions reduced by 35 to 40 percent.Modi ji - Mayur, I enjoyed talking to you and do congratulate your friends on my behalf…. You found a solution to the problem that you had in college life and now the path chosen by all of you is providing solutions in solving environmental issues and you have taken up cudgels to address it. And it is the power of the youth of our country that they take up any big challenge and look for avenues. I wish you all the best. Thank you very muchMayur Patil - Thank you Sir! Thank you!Friends, a few years back if someone used to say that he wants to do business or wants to start a new company, then, the elders of the family used to answer that – “Why don’t you want to do a job, have a job bhai! There is security in the job, there is salary. The hassle is also less. But, if someone wants to start their own company today, then all the people around him are very excited and also fully supportive. Friends, this is the turning point of India's growth story, where people are now not only dreaming of becoming job seekers but also becoming job creators. This will further strengthen India's stature on the global stage.My dear countrymen, today in 'Mann Ki Baat' we talked about Amrit Mahotsav. We discussed how our countrymen are fulfilling new resolutions in this AmritKaal and also mentioned the stories related to the valour of our Army in the month of December. In the month of December, another big day is ahead of us from which we take inspiration. This day is the death anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar on 6th December. Baba Saheb had devoted his entire life in rendering his duties for the country and society. We the countrymen should never forget the basic spirit of our Constitution, that our Constitution expects all of us to discharge our duties - so let us also take a pledge that in the Amrit Mahotsav, we will try to fulfill our duties with full devotion. This shall be our true tribute to Baba Saheb.Friends, we are now entering the month of December. It is natural that the next 'Mann Ki Baat' of 2021 will be the last 'Mann Ki Baat' of this year. We will start the journey again in 2022 and yes, I keep expecting a lot of suggestions from you and will keep doing so. How are you bidding farewell to this year, what are you going to do in the new year, please do tell and yes!... Don't forget that Corona has not gone yet. It is the responsibility of all of us to take precautions.Many many thanks!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-mann-ki-baat-modi-salutes-brave-sons-and-mothers-of-india-s-defence-sectors-read-full-text-of-83rd-episode-here-101638082246327.html

28-11-2021||India||On Mann Ki Baat, PM Modi talks about Australian Krishna devotee from Perth||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday talked about an Australian woman, who runs an art gallery in the Swan Valley of Perth city, as he addressed the nation in the 83rd edition of his monthly radio programme Mann Ki Baat.PM Modi said Jagattarini Dasi, who joined the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (Iskcon) in 1970, spent more than 13 years in Uttar Pradesh's Vrindavan before going back to her country.“She says though she has returned to Australia she could not forget Vrindavan. And that is why she remained in touch with Vrindavan and its spiritual joy. She made a Vrindavan in Australia by making art her medium,” PM Modi said.Visitors to her Sacred Art Gallery in Perth get to see her art and glimpse the traditions and cultures of India’s well-known pilgrim towns of Vrindavan, Nabadweep and Puri, he said.Jagattarini Dasi was a leading actor in Australia before she joined Iskcon founded by Abhay Charanaravinda Bhaktivedanta Swami or Srila Prabhupada in 1970, according to the movement’s website.“In 1983 she moved with her family to Sri Vrindavan Dhama, and they spent the next 13 years teaching in Bhaktivedanta Gurukula. In her spare time, she regularly journeyed by local transport to significant holy places throughout the outlying Braja District,” the website said.Jagattarini Dasi, her husband Bhurijana and her family have been based in Perth since 1996.“Jagattarini Mataji continues to draw her artistic inspiration from Vraja Dhama, and since 1998 she has been working with a variety of mediums producing miniature three-dimensional diorama exhibits, depicting Krishna’s nectarean Vrindavan pastimes,”“She is establishing these dioramas within a project known as Gopinatha Dharma, which is meant to attract souls to the glories of Sri Vrindavan Dhama.”PM Modi said the amazing effort of Jagattarini “indeed shows us the power of Krishna Bhakti”. “I wish her all the best in this work,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-mann-ki-baat-pm-modi-talks-about-australian-krishna-devotee-from-perth-101638076828525.html

There is a standing instruction that unvaccinated teachers will not be allowed to take classes. Teachers are role models and the government views their attitude seriously,” said the minister. There are around 160,000 school teachers and 25,000 non-teaching employees in the state. “Children’s safety is our main concern. We can’t justify action of these unvaccinated teachers. We will give [them] some more time [to comply] otherwise the government will act against them,” the minister said in the state capital. He said besides their beliefs, some of the reluctant lot skipped vaccination citing their poor health. Majority of these unvaccinated school employees are from north Kerala districts. Many health activists and teachers’ organisations have suggested organising a proper awareness drive to fight against vaccine hesitancy. “A modern society can’t accept this. Some of the religious states like Saudi Arabia and Vatican are carrying out the jabbing exercise strictly. No religion supports such an attitude,” said public health expert Dr Pamanabha Shenoy. Some of the teachers’ organisations too have decried the rejection of vaccination . “All teachers should take jabs and we will support any initiative in this regard,” said Kerala Pradesh School Teachers’ Association leader M Salahuddin. Many urged religious leaders to give an open call supporting vaccination. Also Read | RT-PCR test not mandatory for children on Sabarimala pilgrimage: KeralaMistrust or aversion towards vaccines, especially in Muslim-majority areas, is not a new phenomenon in Kerala. Even before the pandemic outbreak, the Left Front government led by the Communist Party of India (Marxist), had instructed all educational institutions to make basic vaccination compulsory for enrolling children in schools. In 2017, the government constituted a 17 member expert panel headed by Dr B Ekbal to chalk out a comprehensive health policy. One of the key recommendations of the panel was to make vaccination compulsory for children. While enrolling children, parents will have to produce details of vaccines administered to their wards. In Kerala, among the eligible population, 96% have received the first dose of the anti-Covid 19 vaccine and 65% have received both the doses, according to the health ministry data. The state has been among the worst Covid-19 affected states in the country with 39,679 infected related deaths, second only to Maharashtra. On Saturday, the state reported 4,741 Covid cases taking its active caseload to 48,501.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5000-school-teachers-staff-not-vaccinated-in-kerala-101638080178336.html

After the construction, the bridge crossing Noney valley will become the world's highest pier bridge," Sandeep Sharma, Chief Engineer of the project told ANI.|#+|He further said that the work on the bridge will be completed by December 2023."The first phase which extends for 12 km has already been commissioned. nearly 98 per cent of the work is complete on the second phase and by February 2022, it will be ready. The third phase from Khongsang to Tupul will be completed by November 2022. The fourth and the last phase of the bridge which extends from Tupul to Imphal valley, will be completed by December 2023," he said.The official also informed that the 111 km project consists of 61 per cent of tunnels.According to the Chief Engineer, the total anticipated cost of the bridge is ₹374 crore.Speaking about the hurdles that are being faced in the construction of the bridge, Sharma said, "Landslides often occur on NH-37 during monsoon, which is the only route to this place. From April to October, there is immense rainfall here. During that time, it is difficult to work here. There are also some problems related to insurgency, which creates a problem sometimes."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/worlds-tallest-railway-bridge-pier-to-come-up-in-manipur-101638058848881.html

The central government has added several countries – including South Africa, Hong Kong and Bostwana – to the list from where travellers would need to follow additional measures on entry, including post-arrival testing for infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mann-ki-baat-pm-modi-to-address-83rd-edition-of-monthly-radio-programme-today-101638060174164.html
28-11-2021||India||Ahead of Parliament's winter session, PM Modi to chair all-party meet today||Ahead of Parliament’s Winter Session on Monday, the Narendra Modi-led central government has called an all-party meeting, to be chaired by the Prime Minister, on Sunday to discuss the agenda for the session and other important businesses.Vice president M Venkaiah Naidu, who is also the chairman of the Upper House of Parliament, has convened a meeting of Rajya Sabha floor leaders in the evening to discuss the proceedings of the Winter Session.Also Read | Key Bills likely to be tabled during winter session of ParliamentSuch meetings are often convened to ensure smooth functioning of the House ahead of the commencement of the actual Parliament session.The opening day proceedings of the seventh session of the 17th Lok Sabha will be quite significant politically, this time since the central government is set to introduce The Farm Laws Repeal Bill, 2021 – all-important draft legislation to withdraw the three contentious agricultural laws that spurned the year-long protests by farmers' unions at the border points of Delhi.However, even though the bill to repeal the three contentious laws has been approved by the Union cabinet and will likely pass the Lok Sabha in the forthcoming Winter Session, it might not be enough to appease the protesting farmers, who still demand guaranteed prices for crops – a minimum support price (MSP) for their harvests.Marking one year of “dedication, fight, and commitment” with respect to the farmers' protests, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait said earlier this week that guaranteed MSP still remains one of the key demands for the movement and as such, the decisions taken by the government in the upcoming Parliament session will influence the future of the farmers' struggle.Meanwhile, the Opposition, too, is adamant to discuss the bill in the House to corner the government over the farm issues. The Congress has issued three-line whips in both the Houses, asking party MPs to be present on Monday.The party also plans to hold a meeting with other opposing parties an hour before the winter session begins to work unitedly in raising “critical matters of peoples’ concerns”, and to finalise the strategy for both Houses to highlight the “failure of the central government, especially on three farm laws” and rising inflation and others burning issues.Also Read | Ahead of Parliament’s winter session, VP Naidu urges lawmakers to rethink before disrupting HouseNotably, the bill to remove the three farm laws, that is to be introduced in the upcoming Winter Session, states: “To enable the farmers to sell their produce at higher prices and benefit from technological improvements, farmers have been provided access to agriculture markets which will help them increase their income. With this objective three farm laws...were enacted, as a part of the government's endeavour to improve the condition of farmers including small and marginal farmers.”It also says that even though “only a group of farmers are protesting against these laws, the government has tried hard to sensitise the farmers on the importance of the farm laws and explain the merits through several meetings and other forums”. Without taking away the existing mechanisms available to farmers, new avenues were provided for the trade of their produce, the proposed legislation states.The Winter Session is set to start on Monday, November 29, and will work till December 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-parliament-s-winter-session-pm-modi-to-chair-all-party-meet-today-101638056175886.html

28-11-2021||India||HC upholds right to dissent while rejecting book ban plea||The right to dissent is the essence of a vibrant democracy, the Delhi high court has said in its order dismissing a plea to ban Congress leader Salman Khurshid’s book. The freedom to express ideas freely cannot be permitted to be overshadowed, the court of justice Yashwant Varma said in its order released late Friday evening.On Thursday, the high court had dismissed a plea by a lawyer Vineet Jindal seeking a ban on Khurshid’s book, titled Sunrise Over Ayodhya: Nationhood in Our Times, which had triggered outcry from certain quarters, particularly over the fact that the author had compared a “robust version” of Hindutva to the jihadist Islam of terror groups such as the Islamic State (IS) and the Boko Haram.Justice Varma said that the “fundamental and precious right guaranteed by our Constitution can neither be restricted nor denied merely on the perceived apprehension of the view being unpalatable or disagreeable to some”.“The right to dissent or to have and express a contrarian view with respect to current affairs or historical events are the essence of a vibrant democracy….The freedom to freely express ideas and opinions cannot be permitted to be overshadowed by the ominous cloud of being non-conformist,” the judge said in his order.The court said that “a democracy governed by the rule of law would be placed in serious peril if creative voices were stifled or intellectual freedom suppressed or suffocated”.“In the considered opinion of this court, the freedom of speech and expression as conferred and guaranteed by Article 19 of the Constitution must be zealously protected by Courts unless it is conclusively established that the work would fall foul of the constitutional or statutory restrictions on the exercise of that right which apply…The freedoms guaranteed by Article 19 are not liable to be freely expressed only if they fall in line with a majoritarian view,” the court said in a six-page order.While rejecting the plea, the court quoted Voltaire and said, “While I wholly disagree of what you say, I will defend to the death your right to say it.”The petitioner had said that the book violates “the fundamental right guaranteed under articles 19 and 21” of the Constitution. Other than seeking a ban on the sale, purchase and all forms of circulation, the petition also asked the court to ensure that it is not published henceforth in any form – neither print nor digital.On Thursday, the court had observed that what it could do if people are feeling so sensitive.“Ask people not to buy the book or read it. Tell people it is badly authored, read something better”…“Why don’t you tell people not to buy the book? What can we do if people are feeling so sensitive? No one is asking them to read it,” the judge had remarked.Khurshid’s house was vandalised in Nainital in Uttarakhand after the release of the book, with parts of it set on fire by mobs. Kumaun police had booked 21 people in connection with the incident.Khurshid’s book on the Ayodhya verdict was released last week. It explored the apex court’s landmark judgment on the Ayodhya dispute.On November 17, a trial court had refused give interim relief to stop publication, circulation and sale of the book based on a complaint by Hindu Sena president Vishnu Gupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-upholds-right-to-dissent-while-rejecting-book-ban-plea-101638052460459.html
28-11-2021||India||Can India shape the regional, global geopolitical landscape?||The difference between a major power and a smaller player is that the former is able to shape the environment within which it operates. The latter must take the geopolitical landscape it confronts as a given and to which it must constantly adjust the best it can. In one case, there is a degree of independent agency. In the other, very little.Since its independence in 1947, India has always tried to position itself as a shaper rather than as a taker. It has not always been successful, but it has never given up on its aspiration to be one of the architects of the evolving regional and global geopolitical landscape. The ability to be a shaper depends upon where India stands in the metrics of power, that is, its economic and military capabilities, and in today’s world, its technological prowess. It also depends upon the quality of its diplomacy, or the ability to mobilise its available power to persuade others to follow its lead. Where does India stand in this respect?For emerging powers like India, it is a period of significant change, even disorder, that throws up spaces for expanding one’s geopolitical footprint and enhancing influence. But there are also risks because one’s existing zones of influence may be encroached upon by other powers taking advantage of the same flux in interstate relations. For India, the subcontinent is obviously the primary locus of influence and its ability to shape a larger regional or global domain will depend upon its success in managing and consolidating its periphery. India is both a continental power and a maritime power. Both will need attention.While we live in a world of extraordinary and unprecedented flux, the opportunities to expand India’s strategic space and interests outweigh the risks. There are elevated risks which must be dealt with, but they should not induce a defensive mindset, or worse, a siege mentality. Nor should optical agility substitute for substantive, intensive and sometimes painstaking work to locate promising opportunities, and leverage them to India’s advantage. Much of this must be done without the pressure to win domestic or foreign acclaim.India is a participant in several fora of major powers like the G20, the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa), the SCO (Shanghai Cooperation Organization), the Quad (composed of India, the US, Japan and Australia), and is an active player at the United Nations. These are platforms that contribute to the shaping of the emerging regional and global orders in multiple domains.India should make best use of them to shape emerging global governance regimes conducive to its own interests. Its current participation in the various norm-setting working groups and informal mechanisms associated with these platforms is thin and needs to be greatly enhanced in numbers and quality . This is the ground zero where the new global order is being shaped.How should India balance its continental vis-à-vis maritime interests? It is clear that contested land borders with hostile adversaries, China and Pakistan, demand a posture of holding the line, deploying capabilities that make it costly for them to engage in provocative behaviour and hostile action. We are currently not in a position to reverse the occupation of Indian territory that has already taken place.We have a significant advantage as a maritime nation with open seas to the west, south and east of India. This is the natural space for expanding our geopolitical footprint. Holding the line in the north and west and expanding in the maritime domain all around the peninsula should be our overall strategy. Our resource allocation for defence must reflect this strategic choice.If India remains anchored in the subcontinent, it cannot aspire to an optimum regional or global role. But the neighbourhood first policy has not been backed by a major investment of human and material resources. Even though it is difficult to insulate the neighbourhood policy from domestic politics, it is imperative that this is pursued with diligence. A broad political consensus should be evolved on this score.With China intruding into the subcontinent with its larger resources, India has to make a greater commitment towards realizing a densely interconnected and economically integrated subcontinent with India as its engine of growth. India has assets in terms of cultural affinity, proximity and ability to provide public goods, which China cannot match. Pakistan will eventually have to be part of this project. Its co-option into a Chinese-dominated Central Asian system is not in India’s long-term interest.In bilateral and multilateral negotiations, India is often painted as a perennial naysayer and an obstructionist. On other occasions, it is flattered by being cast in the role of a critical player in whose hands rests the fate of the world. Both these stratagems are designed to put India under intense psychological pressure, generating a compulsion not to be seen as a spoiler, or conversely to be tempted into playing a larger than life role on the international stage.We must not fall prey to this cynical game. We should determine what our interests are and then decide how we package them for the conduct of our diplomacy. The package must not become a substitute for substance.These are some of the ways in which we should endeavour to shape the world around us.Shyam Saran is a former Foreign Secretary and a Senior Fellow at CPR||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/can-india-shape-the-regional-global-geopolitical-landscape-101638048987763.html
28-11-2021||India||25% of India’s population still poor, says Niti Aayog||A quarter of India’s population is still poor, according to the first National Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) released by the NITI Aayog onThursday, but the situation has improved since then, officials said.Bihar has the highest proportion of people who are poor (51.91%), followed by Jharkhand (42.16%), Uttar Pradesh (37.79%) and Madhya Pradesh (36.65%), the index showed. Kerala, Goa, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu and Punjab have registered the lowest poverty rate among all states and are at the bottom of the index.On Saturday, the NITI Aayog officials said that the index is based on the National Health Family Survey for 2015-16 (NFHS-4) data and preliminary findings from the NFHS-5 suggests improvement in some of the key indicators of the index.India ranks 66 out of 109 countries in the Global MPI 2021.The national MPI 2021 has been developed by NITI Aayog in consultation with 12 ministries and in partnership with state governments and index publishing agencies – Oxford University’s Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative, and United Nations Development Programme.The national MPI-2021 is a measure to define poverty based on assessment of three crucial parameters – health, education and standard of living – on 12 indicators such as nutrition, years of schooling, access to cooking fuel, sanitation, drinking water, electricity, etc.Bihar has the highest number of malnourished people, while Uttar Pradesh topped the list of state and Union territories in child and adolescent mortality, the index showed.NFHS-4 data has been used to derive an idea of baseline multidimensional poverty to know the situation on ground before the full rollout of various central government schemes, the NITI Aayog official said.“NFHS-4 precedes the full roll out of (central government’s) flagship schemes on housing, drinking water, sanitation, electricity, cooking fuel, financial inclusion, and other major efforts towards improving school attendance, nutrition, mother and child health, etc. Hence, it serves as a useful source for measuring the situation at baseline, that is, before large-scale roll out of nationally important schemes,” NITI Aayog said in a statement on Saturday.Preliminary findings of NFHS-5 show improvement in several indicators, officials said. For instance, in Bihar, there is significant reduction in deprivation in electricity. As per the MPI-2021, 39.86% of households have no electricity, but as per the NFHS-5 provisional estimate, it has significantly reduced to 3.70%.“The NFHS-5 data suggest improvement in access to clean cooking fuel, sanitation, and electricity which translates to reduction in deprivation. These improvements indicate an overall direction of significant reduction in the incidence of multidimensional poverty in the forthcoming index based on NFHS 5 (2019-20) household micro data. The national MPI based on NFHS-5 of the data period 2019-20 will be computed when the unit level micro data for the same is released by IIPS and ministry of health and family welfare next year,” NITI Aayog said in its statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/25-of-india-s-population-still-poor-says-niti-aayog-101638041167194.html

28-11-2021||India||Aircel Maxis case: Delhi court summons P Chidambaram, son Karti||New Delhi: A Delhi court on Saturday summoned former Union minister P Chidambaram and his son Karti after taking cognizance of the separate charge sheets filed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in the Aircel Maxis case.The case, which is being probed by the two central agencies, relates to the alleged irregularities in the grant of Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) approval in the Aircel-Maxis deal in 2006 when Chidambaram was the finance minister during the tenure of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government. The CBI and the ED have alleged that as the finance minister, Chidambaram granted approval to the deal beyond his capacity, which benefitted certain persons and he received kickbacks in return. Special Judge MK Nagpal noted that there was sufficient evidence to summon Chidambaram and the other accused in the corruption and money-laundering cases.“Therefore, in view of the above and even despite pendency of some further investigation on certain aspects, as stated in the complaints, and non-execution of the pending LRs [letters rogatory] , this court is of the considered opinion that sufficient grounds exist to take congnizance and for proceeding further against all the fourteen accused persons being prosecuted through these complaints for commission of the offence of money-laundering as defined by Section 3 of the PMLA and made punishable by Section 4 of the said Act,” the judge said.Chidambaram’s counsel could not be reached for a comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aircel-maxis-case-delhi-court-summons-p-chidambaram-son-karti-101638040739293.html
28-11-2021||India||Ahead of elections, Kejriwal reaches out to Punjab’s protesting teachers||Aam Aadmi Party national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday joined a protest of contractual teachers in Mohali and promised to fulfil their demand if his party wins next year’s state elections.At least 13,000 teachers have been protesting across the state demanding regularisation of their jobs. Kejriwal, who arrived in the state on Saturday, said they will resolve the issues faced by the teachers on priority.“I promise you that when our government comes, we will regularise your jobs. Give your younger brother a chance and if I fail, you can show me the door. We will improve the (standard of) education in Punjab,” he said. Kejriwal said that his government improved the education system in Delhi and addressed the issues of teachers there and would do so in Punjab also if elected in next year’s state elections.The AAP chief also targeted state education Minister Pargat Singh over his remark that Punjab had the best schools. Kejriwal asked Pargat to come and ask the protesting teachers how good the state schools were. “They will tell their pain and then you will come to know how good the Punjab schools are. If you do not understand the problem and then how will you find a solution for it,” said KejriwalAAP Punjab chief Bhagwant Mann, who accompanied Kejriwal to the protest, said the Punjab government was ignoring the legitimate demands of the teachers.“Teachers are the builders of the nation. It is unfortunate that they have to sit on protest for their demands. I am the son of a teacher so I understand your pain. The AAP is with you.”Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi hit out at Kejriwal, accusing him of making “irresponsible utterances to pursue his vested interests by spreading misinformation about non-implementation of recent pro-people decisions taken by his government.”In the 2017 Punjab assembly polls, the Aam Aadmi Party emerged as the second-largest party, winning 20 seats in 117-member assembly.With agency inputs||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-elections-kejriwal-reaches-out-to-punjab-s-protesting-teachers-101638040439176.html
28-11-2021||India||Four health dept officials to monitor screening at international airports in TN||Chennai Tamil Nadu has intensified precautionary measures at all four international airports in the state in the wake of the detection of the new COVID-19 virus variant ‘Omicron’ in South Africa and has appointed four health department officials to personally monitor the situation, State Minister Ma Subramanian said here on Saturday. These officials would be stationed in Chennai, Coimbatore, Madurai and Tiruchirappalli aiports, the Minister for Medical and Family Welfare said here. “The new virus variant Omicron has been detected in five countries -- South Africa, Botswana, Israel, Belgium, Hong Kong (China). Several countries are taking preventive measures to protect themselves from this new age virus.We too have stepped up preventive measures in a full-fledged manner at international airports (of the State)”, he told reporters. As part of this, four health department officials were appointed today and they would be present in these airports to monitor the screening measures, he said. Subramanian, along with health department principal secretary J Radhakrishnan and senior officials, inspected the screening procedures at the airport here on Saturday. “As far as Chennai airport is concerned, passengers arriving from South Africa, Brazil, China, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Israel undergo intense monitoring, including thermal screening. As many as 99 countries have recognized the Covishield and Covaxin vaccines. Verification of their vaccination reports are also done here”, he said. Overseas passengers on arrival undergo RT-PCR tests at the airport, he said, adding that from October 21 till date 55,090 people were tested, of whom three were COVID-19 positive. Reiterating that “vaccinating oneself” and “wearing a facial mask” are the weapons against COVID-19, he said 78 lakh people were yet to receive the second dose of vaccination in Tamil Nadu. “People should understand the necessity to get vaccinated. Reports from neighbouring Karnataka have said that 281 students tested positive in one particular area. Also in Tiruvallur district, five school students tested positive. These incidents show that the virus is present”, he said. Subramanian said the department would conduct the 12th Mega Vaccination Camp on Sunday through 50,000 camps. “We have 1.12 crore vaccines as stock and even today, the Centre informed us that it would send 12 lakh additional doses. People should make use of the opportunity and get vaccinated. They should always wear a mask to protect themselves”, he said. To a query about Tamil film icon Kamal Haasan testing COVID-19 positive after returning from the U.S.A., he said the actor has received both doses of the vaccine and was in good health. “Very soon he (Kamal Haasan) will be discharged”, the Minister said.

National Disaster Response Force units have been deployed in Chengelpet and Kancheepuram districts.Addressing a press conference in Chennai on Saturday, Ramachandran said the worst-hit districts included Ariyalur, Tirunelveli and Tirupur.On Saturday, Chennai recorded 2.5 cm rainfall till 5.30pm, with several localities continue to witness waterlogging and authorities cutting power supply at a few places as a precaution. Three subways and a few roads were closed due to inundation, a civic official said.“Water has entered my house again. Due to continuous stagnation, my toddler son is sick with a water-borne disease,” said R Mahendra, a resident of Velachery, a low-lying area in Chennai.IMD has sounded ‘red alert’ implying possibility of excess rainfall for Chennai and all coastal districts since Friday. IMD has forecast heavy to very heavy rainfall with isolated extremely heavy rain over Thiruvallur district and heavy to very heavy rain over Chennai, Chengalpattu and Kanchipuram districts till November 28.In the ongoing northeast monsoon, from October 1 till November 27, the state received about 60.33 cm of rainfall as against the usual 34.57 cm for this period, which is 75% in excess, said Ramachandran.Chennai has recorded 71% excess rainfall during the period while its adjoining districts (Tiruvallur, Kanchipuram and Chengalpattu) have recorded over 88% excess rainfall, the IMD said in a bulletin.Among the districts receiving maximum rainfall in the last 24 hours ending at 4.30 pm on Saturday, include Tiruvallur (20cm), Chengalpattu (18cm), Kancheepuram (17cm) and Chennai (10cm).The Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) is operating more than 750 heavy duty pumps across the city to drain rainwater, a civic official said, adding that the civic body has identified localities that are heavily flooded and in the last 10 days, they have made temporary measures to divert the water to the nearest canals.Southern Thoothukudi district, which received 2.5 cm of rainfall on Thursday, has not received much rainfall in the past two days, but most of the irrigation tanks across the district filling up. “We proactively opened the surplus channel of Vellur tank near Adhichanallur into Thamirabarani river last night (Friday night) so we were able to avoid breach of Kaalvai, Appankulam and Vellur tank which would have otherwise entered habitation,” Thoothukudi collector K Senthil Raj said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/three-die-in-tamil-nadu-imd-warns-of-heavy-rainfall-on-sunday-101638039962486.html
28-11-2021||India||Stalin asks guv to send anti-NEET bill to President||Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M K Stalin on Saturday urged Governor R N Ravi to forward a Bill, passed by the Assembly to exempt the state from the ambit of NEET and provide for admission to medical courses based on Class XII marks, to President Ram Nath Kovind for his assent.Stalin called on Ravi at the Raj Bhavan here and requested him to immediately send the Bill to Kovind so as to get expeditious Presidential assent for it. The Chief Minister was accompanied by Water Resources Minister Duraimurugan, Health Minister Ma Subramanian and top government officials, an official release here said. Referring to the meeting between Ravi and Stalin, a Raj Bhavan release also cited discussions on rain and COVID-19 pandemic related initiatives taken up by the government.After it assumed power in May this year, the DMK government got the Bill passed in the backdrop of a Salem based medical aspirant’s death by suicide. On September 13, 2021, the state Assembly passed the TN Admission to Undergraduate Medical Degree Courses Bill, 2021.The Bill, referring to recommendations of a high-level committee, led by Justice A K Rajan, a retired judge of the Madras High Court said it is to dispense with the requirement of NEET for admission to UG Medical courses.The NEET is not a fair or equitable method of admission since it favoured the rich and elite sections of society, according to the Bill’s preamble. Social groups mostly affected due to NEET were the students of Tamil medium, having rural background of government schools, those having parental income of less than ₹2.5 lakh per annum and the socially depressed and disadvantaged groups like the Most Backward Classes, the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, as per the statement of objects of the Bill that quoted the findings of the panel.The Bill is also to protect all vulnerable student communities from being discriminated and bring them to the mainstream of medical and dental education and ensure a robust public health care infrastructure across the state, particularly in the rural areas.The panel had concluded that if NEET continued for a few more years, the health care system of Tamil Nadu would be very badly affected and there may not be enough doctors for postings in Primary Health Centres or state-run hospitals and that the rural and urban poor may not be able to join the medical courses.Barring the BJP, all other parties in Tamil Nadu are opposed to NEET and this issue became politically sensitive over the years following deaths by suicide of over a dozen medical aspirants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cm-stalin-urges-governor-to-send-bill-to-exempt-tn-from-neet-to-president-kovind-for-nod-101638038219537.html
28-11-2021||India||Parliament march cancelled as Tomar calls for end of stir||There were signs of a thaw between the government and protesting farmers on Saturday as farm unions suspended their November 29 tractor march to Parliament, hours after agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar appealed to farmers call off their stir.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of 40 farm unions, said it was suspending, till December 4, its plans to hold a demonstration in the national capital to coincide with the winter session of Parliament.The announcement came soon after Tomar requested the farmers to return home “since the government has decided to repeal the farm laws”. The Centre has agreed to decriminalize stubble burning, a pending demand of the protesting farmers, the Union minister said.“The farmers’ demand was to decriminalise stubble burning. The government of India has agreed to this demand,” he said. The burning of farm residue has been a key contributor to the severe air pollution in the national capital region, where several curbs, including a ban on stubble burning, have been imposed.The government is set to move and pass a fresh law in Parliament to repeal its three farm legislations, enacted in September 2020, but farm unions are pressing ahead with a slew of other demands, including a law to guarantee minimum support prices (MSPs) for agricultural produce.In a statement on Saturday, Tomar said that the government has also decided to constitute a panel to discuss the farmers’ demands of crop diversification and “making the MSP system more transparent”.“Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced to constitute a committee to hold discussions on the issue of crop diversification, zero-budget farming and making the MSP system more transparent and effective,” he said.The committee will have representations from farmers, Tomar said, adding that with this their demands on the MSP “stands fulfilled”. MSPs are state-assured floor rates meant to help avoid distress sale.On the farmers’ demand of withdrawal of all criminal cases filed against them during the year-long agitation, Tomar said it was in the domain of state governments. “Looking at the severity of the cases, the state governments have to take a call and the issue of compensation is also to be decided by them,” he said, adding that every state will decide as per their state laws.Stating that there is no justification for the continuation of the agitation after the government announced repeal of the three farm laws, Tomar said: “Therefore, I appeal to all farmers organisations to end the protest ethically and show their big heart. They should return to their respective homes.”The Farm Laws Repeal Bill, 2021, has been listed for introduction and passage in Lok Sabha on the first day of the Winter Session on Monday. Tomar will introduce the bill in the house, which was approved by the Union Cabinet on Wednesday.In a televised address on November 19, Prime Minister Modi, “while apologising to the people of the country”, said that the government “could not explain to some of our farmer brothers a truth that was as clear as a flame” about the farm laws.Reacting to the minister’s statement on Saturday, farm leaders said they would wait till December 4 for a response to a letter they have written to Modi, enlisting their demands.“We are suspending the Parliament march on Monday. We had written to the Prime Minister for withdrawal of cases against farmers, allotment of land for building a memorial for farmers who lost their lives (during the protest), suspension of Ajay Mishra Teni from the Union Cabinet over the Lakhimpur Kheri violence, along with other issues,” SKM leader Darshan Pal told mediapersons.“We will wait for the government’s response to our letter to the Prime Minister, in which we have listed all our rightful demands. The government must hold talks to sort out all remaining issues,” he said. The farm unions will hold another meeting on December 4, he added.Besides a statutory guarantee for MSP, the farmers want a parcel of land for a memorial to the peasants who died during the protests.They have also sought changes to a proposed electricity bill to keep energy prices cheap for farmers and modifications to an anti-pollution law in force in the national capital region that includes provisions to penalise farmers burning paddy straw.On Saturday, farm leaders reiterated they were not calling of the agitation and want a law guaranteeing MSP for their crops.“We have not called off our agitation. We want a law on MSP and talks on all our demands as soon as possible,” said Rakesh Tikait, a key face of the farmers’ movement.The three laws to be revoked were aimed at easing restrictions on trade in farm produce, allowing food traders to stockpile large stocks of food for future sales, and laying down a national framework for contract farming based on written agreements.The farm unions, however, said the legislation would have left them at the mercy of large corporations, eroding their bargaining power.The decision to scrap the laws has come ahead of crucial state elections in Uttar Pradesh, the country’s most populous state, and Punjab, where farmers are an influential voting bloc.The SKM has also demanded sacking of Union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra Teni. The minister’s son was arrested after his vehicle ploughed through farmers returning from a protest in Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur Kheri.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parliament-march-cancelled-as-tomar-calls-for-end-of-stir-101638038041641.html
28-11-2021||India||Asha worker Matilda Kullu who battled casteism, ridicule to save lives and made it to Forbes India list||Bhubaneswar: Had it not been for the efforts of Matilda Kullu, the 45-year-old tribal ASHA worker Odisha’s Sundargarh district featured in the Forbes India W-Power 2021 list along with banker Arundhati Bhattacharya and actress Rasika Duggal, people in her village would be resorting to black magic to cure ailments rather than visit a hospital.Matilda, who was appointed as an Accredited Social Health Activist for Gargadbahal village in Baragaon tehsil of Odisha’s Sundargarh district 15 years ago, did not have it easy when she started work.“People did not think of going to hospital when they fell sick. When I used to advise people to go to hospital, they used to ridicule me. I also had to bear the brunt of casteism,” she said. “It took years of work before I could make people understand the need to visit doctors instead of rushing to the local witchdoctor.”As one of the 47,000-odd ASHA workers in Odisha, Matilda’s hands have always been full with her daily workload comprising doorstep visits for immunization of newborns as well as adolescent girls, antenatal check-up, post-natal check-up, counselling of women on birth preparedness, breastfeeding and complementary feeding, and prevention of common infections, including reproductive tract and sexually transmitted infections.Her day begins at five in the morning, as she rushes to finish household chores, prepare lunch for her family of four, and feed the cattle before she hops on her cycle for doorstep visits. When the pandemic began last year, Matilda’s schedule became more hectic, as she started visiting 50-60 households everyday to check on people suspected of having Covid-19 symptoms.“Everyday I would get out of home and visit families looking for Covid suspects and then inform the local primary health centre,” said Matilda. “People were scared of being taken for tests as there was lot of stigma attached to a Covid patient last year.”Although the job entailed meeting potentially infected people in their homes, a majority of ASHAs were not provided with masks, gloves and sanitisers. After the first wave ebbed and vaccination started, Matilda said she had a tough time convincing villagers to get inoculated.“As I have was working with people in my village for a long time, they listened to me and got vaccinated,” said Matilda, who rues that despite all the hard work she puts in, her earning is a measly ₹4,500. “During the pandemic, the state government had given a one-time incentive of ₹2,000,” she said. “But now that has been withdrawn, and we get just ₹4,500.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/asha-worker-matilda-kullu-who-battled-casteism-ridicule-to-save-lives-and-made-it-to-forbes-india-list-101638038039924.html

He was arrested and we are investigating the matter,” a senior police officer said.The accused, a mason, lives with his wife and two daughters at their home in Ramchandraghat area of the district, nearly 50km from the state capital, Agartala, the officials said.Pradip also attacked his elder brother, Amalesh Debroy, 45, killing him on the spot, and his wife, Mala Pal Debroy, who managed to escape, Khowai superintendent of police Kiran Kumar said giving details about the incident.His wife is undergoing treatment at Govind Ballabh Pant (GBP) hospital in Agartala, he said.“Seeing the accused attack his daughters, his brother came to save them but he received repeated blows of the sharp weapon on different parts of his body leading to death,” news agency ANI quoted Kumar as saying.Pradip then exited his house and “started attacking whoever he found in front of him”, Kumar said. “One Krishna Das who was passing by the Debroy’s house along with his son Karanbir fell prey to his anger,” he said.While Das, 54, died on the spot, his son, Karanbir, 22, sustained injuries and is undergoing treatment at GBP hospital, Kumar said.On receipt of the information about the incident, when a police team led by Inspector Satyajit Mallick reached the spot, Debroy attacked him. The police team took Pradip in custody, while Mallick was rushed to the district hospital, officials said.He was referred to GBP hospital, where he died after suffering severe blood loss, the officials said.“We have registered a case,” another senior official said, adding that the motive behind the attacks is “still unclear”. The case was registered under sections 302 (murder), 307(attempt to murder ), 326 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or means), 333 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt to deter public servant from his duty), and other relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code, said the official.The accused was produced in court on Saturday, and does not have any criminal record, the official said.Chief minister Biplab Kumar Deb condemned the incident. “Deeply shocked at martyrdom of Khowai Police Station second officer Satyajit Mallick during his duty, following an attack of a mad miscreant. I pray for all those and the police officer who died in the incident so that their souls might rest in peace. I extend my condolences to the bereaved family members.

28-11-2021||India||Farm laws will be repealed the day Parliament resumes: Rajnath Singh||Asserting that the Bharatiya Janata Party government has always been sympathetic towards farmers, defence minister Rajnath Singh said the three farm laws will be withdrawn on the first day of the winter session of Parliament.“We consider farmers as god. The BJP government has always been sympathetic towards farmers. There was a movement against the three laws. Prime Minister Narendra Modi took a decision to withdraw them,” Singh said. “The day Parliament session begins, the three farm laws will be withdrawn.”Singh was addressing 30,000 BJP polling booth workers in Jaunpur on Saturday as the party gears up for state assembly elections in 2022. Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya, state BJP secretary Sunil Bansal, and state president Swatantra Dev Singh were present at the meeting, among several other leaders.Recalling the terror attack on Mumbai on November 26, 2008, Singh accused the then Congress government of not taking effective action against terrorism. Ever since Narendra Modi became Prime Minister in 2014, terrorism was being tackled regularly and effectively, he said.After the terror incidents in Uri and Pulwama, India took strict action against terrorists, sending a message to the entire world that it has the strength to take action across the border to eliminate terror, the defence minister said, referring to the air strike on Pakistani territory in February 2019.India has become a powerful country in the eyes of the world, he said, adding that India has been a country that has never occupied an inch of foreign land. Rather, India has given the message of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (the world is one family) to the whole world, Singh said. However, “if anyone captures even an inch piece of our land, the army will not leave it. Prime Minister Modi has given a free hand to the army,” Singh said.Slamming Akhilesh Yadav, chief of the opposition Samajwadi Party, for his claim that the BJP government didn’t give permission for the Jewar airport, Singh said, “I had passed the proposal of Jewar Airport in 2001 as chief minister of Uttar Pradesh. Yogi ji is completing that work today.”Singh accused the opposition parties of indulging in politics of division just for the sake of power. BJP takes everyone along, he said. Rather than achieving power by dividing society on the basis of caste and creed, he would instead stay away from such power, minister Singh said.“Farm laws was not the only demand of agitating farmers. MSP is also an issue. After over 600 farmers died the government made farm laws repeal announcement. The opposition kept on asking the government to withdraw the laws and ensure MSP. The SP will continue to support agitating farmers,” said SP state spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-laws-will-be-repealed-the-day-parliament-resumes-rajnath-singh-101638037859487.html

They were part of a campaign of giving glory to society. Hindutva cannot be separated from Bharat and Bharat from Hindutva. This thinking made us special but the British came and rewrote the history of India. The British had written that our ancestors were not there before 15 generations. Because there is no Hindu in history means there is no India. Akhand Bharat has broken now,” he added.The country’s partition in 1947 weakened Hindus, Bhagwat said.“When Pakistan was formed, we were not told that we become Bharat and Hindustan; you put another name because they knew that Bharat is Hindu and Hindu is Bharat. Akhand Bharat has been divided where Hindus are weak. Still, if we see the places in India where people are in problem and where the integrity of the country is under threat, those are places where Hindus are weak, where the thought of Hindutva is weak. We have to keep our soul alive, that’s why Mohammad Iqbal said there is something that we never lost our identity.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/people-are-facing-trouble-in-india-only-where-hindus-and-hindutva-weak-rss-chief-mohan-bhagwat-101638037618935.html

Meanwhile, the Central Drugs Laboratory in Kasauli, Himachal Pradesh, has cleared for market release 237,530 doses of Zydus Healthcare’s vaccine called ZyCoV-D.On August 20, the Drugs Controller General of India granted emergency use authorization to Zydus’ vaccine. The vaccine has been tested, and approved for restricted use, in anyone aged 12 years and above, clearing the first shot for use in children and adding a sixth inoculation in India’s toolbox to fight the pandemic. The vaccine works by instructing cells to produce the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which elicits an immune response, and is proven to have an efficacy of 66.6% in phase 3 clinical trial.The central government has placed an order for 10 million doses of the vaccine, at ₹265 per dose. Additionally, ₹93 will be charged as the cost of the needle-free intradermal applicator that is required to administer the shot.The first lot is likely to be provided by the company to the central government next month. The vaccine is to be given on day zero, 28 and 56, as per the schedule shared by the company.NTAGI is working on the protocol and framework for the inclusion of this vaccine in the programme as the vaccination in children is likely going to be introduced in phases with those at high risk (children with co-morbidities) being given priority. Government experts are working on a list of co-morbidities that is likely to include those on cancer treatment, transplant cases, those with compromised immunity, etc.“While eventually everyone would need to be vaccinated against the disease, it makes sense for now to start vaccinating children in a phased manner, as it is a three-dose vaccine and the number of children to be vaccinated would be substantial,” said Dr Anupam Sibal, senior paediatrician and group medical director at Apollo Hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-to-follow-expert-advice-on-vaccinating-children-against-covid-101638036778935.html
28-11-2021||India||Fuel likely to get cheaper in India as global oil prices dip||State-run oil marketers are under pressure to reduce pump prices of petrol and diesel as international oil prices plunged by over $10 a barrel on Friday, the biggest decline since April 2020, mainly on fears of new coronavirus variant Omicron, three people said.Expect petrol and diesel price cuts soon, may be in one or two days, as international fuel rates have fallen sharply,” said one of them, who is a government official. Benchmark Brent crude on Friday plummeted 11.55% to $72.72 a barrel, while US crude West Texas Intermediate closed 13.1% lower at $68.15 per barrel on the last trading day of the week.International oil prices are expected to fall further because of demand concerns due to Omicron, which has been named a “variant of concern” by the World Health Organisation and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the people said, requesting anonymity.Besides Omnicron, a coordinated release of additional oil from strategic reserves of major consumers such as the US, China, India, Japan and South Korea have also affected the fuel market sentiment, the first person said. “OMCs (oil marketing companies) are watching the situation, and they may pass on the benefit to the consumer if prices are sustained at this level,” he said.The companies are cautious as the Friday fall was “like a knee-jerk reaction from fears that the new Covid-19 variant” might “dampen economic growth and trigger another demand slump,” said a second person, who is an executive at a state-run fuel retailer. He, however, downplayed the impact of nations raising supply by releasing oil from strategic reserves. “These announcements could not impact international prices much. However, renewed Covid-19 concerns have now brought about the desired objective,” he said.Major oil consumers – the US, China, India, Japan and South Korea – for the first time reacted to the supply squeeze by producers’ cartel by announcing a coordinated release of additional oil from their respective reserves to cool down raging oil prices. India on November 23 joined the consumers’ group against artificial control of output by the cartel, the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, together known as OPEC+.Indian fuel retailers are wary that the cartel, which is meeting on December 2, may cut supplies to check the price fall. “Thus, international crude oil prices may recover again if OPEC+ announces slower than expected production rollout coming up,” the second person said.In April 2020, when international oil prices plunged below $20 a barrel following global lockdowns due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the producers’ cartel decided to control output. On April 12, OPEC-plus announced an unprecedented 9.7 million barrel a day output cut to check falling crude oil rates.Despite a rise in demand, the grouping did not restore supplies, which led to a spike in international oil prices. In early November this year, crude prices touched $85 a barrel, forcing the central government to slash excise duty on petrol by ₹5 a litre and diesel by ₹10 a litre to provide some relief to consumers. Although oil marketers vouch for changing fuel rates daily to reflect the international market dynamics, there has not been any rate change by them in the past 24 days. In Delhi, petrol has been stable at ₹103.97 per litre, and diesel at ₹86.67 since November 4, which central excise duty was slashed.The three state-run marketers enjoy a virtual monopoly in retail fuel trade in India, with over 90% market share. The petroleum ministry and the three state-run oil firms – Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd – did not respond to emailed queries on the matter.“Price reduction may not be as sharp as the decline in rates of Brent and WTI because only about 30% of crude OMCs purchase from the spot market, balance 70% is based on long-term contracts,” the first person said.Fluctuations in international benchmarks such as Brent also impact long-term crude oil contracts as such term-contracts are also linked to benchmark rates, a third person said.India is the third-largest consumer of imported oil as it imports about 85% crude it processes. The country imported 227 million tonnes of crude oil worth $101.4 billion in 2019-20, which was a Covid-free year.“Although there were some gains last Friday (November 19) also, when average price of Indian basket fell below ₹6,000 per barrel, but OMCs wanted to wait as international oil market was volatile and a minor rate cut followed by immediate price hike was not desirable,” said the person mentioned in the third instance. The Indian basket represents average import rate in rupee terms, a factor of international crude price and exchange rate.As international crude oil prices are likely to fall further in the future, India’s oil marketing companies are also required to pass on the benefit of reduced oil prices “on a day-to-day basis” to give relief to consumers and to facilitate high economic growth, said SC Sharma, a former officer on special duty at the erstwhile Planning Commission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fuel-likely-to-get-cheaper-in-india-as-global-oil-prices-dip-101638036538969.html
