The state government has proposed to hold the winter session in Mumbai between December 22 and 28. The final decision over the dates will be taken in the business advisory committee (BAC) meeting to be held on November 29 at Vidhan Bhavan.Traditionally, the winter session of state legislature is held in Nagpur which is second capital of the state. However, in the wake of CM’s health issues, the state government has decided to hold the winter session in Mumbai.Amid the uncertainty over CM’s appearance in the state cabinet on Thursday, Thackeray chaired the meeting from hospital bed for around an hour. Barring a few minutes towards the end of the meeting, the CM sat through the weekly meeting. Some procedures and physiotherapy sessions post-surgery have delayed Thackeray’s discharge from the hospital. According to officials from his office, CM is likely to remain hospitalised for a few more days.“Even after his discharge from the hospital, he may take a couple of weeks to fully recover and resume work. He will begin working online, but for very limited time and for very important meetings. There is no question of handing over the charge to his deputy or any other senior minister,” said an official.Thackeray has continued the decade-long practice of not handing over charge to deputy CM or any other senior minister in cases wherein the CM is away from his office for any reason. In the early 1990s, then CM Sharad Pawar had handed over his charge to a senior minister while he was on a foreign tour. Since 1995, none of the CMs have done so in case they were unable to attend the office. Thackeray’s hospitalisation has delayed the winter session, which was scheduled to begin from December 7. “The state government has not proposed to hold it between December 22 and 28, with the effective working days being four. Besides a few important bills, including the Shakti Act, the session will see the approval to supplementary demands and the election of the speaker of Assembly,” said a minister, requesting anonymity of name.The minister said they have already spoken to leader of opposition Devendra Fandnavis to reach an amicable decision over changing the dates and venue of the winter session.As per the Nagpur Pact of 1953, the winter session of the state legislature is to be held in the second capital every year. However, last year, too, it was held in Mumbai owing to the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/uddhav-chairs-cabinet-meet-from-hospital-winter-session-in-mumbai-from-dec-22-101637864851670.html
25-11-2021||Lucknow||ECI to take a call soon on biennial legislative council elections in Uttar Pradesh||The Election Commission of India (ECI) has to take a call soon on holding biennial elections to 36 seats of state legislative council from 35 local authorities as well as the 2022 assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh.The term of the members elected to the state legislative council from the local authorities’ area ends on March 7, 2022. On the other hand, the term of the state assembly (17th Vidhan Sabha) ends on May 14, 2022.It remains to be seen whether ECI will hold the biennial elections before the assembly polls or afterwards. A debate is going on about the likely schedule of the two elections as the political parties get ready for both the polls.ECI will have to work out a way for the two polls, ensuring that their timing does not overlap. The poll panel will also have to look at the timing of the elections to the assemblies of Uttarakhand, Punjab, Manipur and Goa that went to the polls along with the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections in early 2017. The terms of the assemblies of these states will end on March 23, March 27, March 19 and March 15, 2022, respectively.Those aware of the developments on the issue said the BJP recently inducted some Samajwadi Party MLCs (whose term expires on March 7, 2022) and apparently promised them a party ticket in the biennial poll. The BJP’s move triggered speculation about an early (December 2021) biennial election so that the party may use the likely “positive” outcome to support its projections for “victory” in the 2022 UP assembly elections. Others, however, said ECI may hold the biennial elections only after the UP assembly elections.“If the ECI decides to hold the biennial elections before the assembly elections, it may have to announce the poll programme within the next few days. ECI’s code of conduct will come into force soon after announcement of the biennial election. The BJP government will thereafter be left with little time to get some of the major development projects launched ahead of 2022 assembly elections.“An early biennial legislative council election (December 2021) will lead to enforcement of code of conduct in the next few days. As the election to the state assembly is likely to be announced in early January 2022, the code of conduct for the same will come into force again. The enforcement of the code of conduct may affect the pace of development. I think the biennial election will be postponed and may be held only after the 2022 assembly polls,” said Rae Bareli BJP leader Dinesh Pratap Singh, MLC whose term expires on March 7, 2022.There is another school of thought which suggests that the two elections can be held simultaneously.“We can’t comment on the issue till the ECI announces the schedule for any of these two elections. ECI, we hope, will take a call on the issue soon,” said officials on condition of anonymity.On the other hand, Samajwadi Party spokesman Rajendra Chaudhary said, “The BJP apparently wants to weaken democracy and ensure that the elections according to its wishes. The SP, however, wants to strengthen democracy.”UP BJP spokesman Chandra Mohan said, “ECI decides the timing of the polls. The BJP will be ready for the polls as and when announced by ECI.”“This (holding elections) is ECI’s jurisdiction. ECI is an independent body and will look at the constitutional requirements to hold the two elections well in time. ECI has powers to decide the timing and enforcement of the code of conduct,” said Professor SK Dwivedi, former head of the department of political science, Lucknow University.It may be mentioned that ECI had announced the schedule for biennial election to 36 seats of the state legislative council on January 29, 2016.“The biennial election to fill up these seats of the members, vacated due to their retirement could not be conducted before their retirement as the percentage of the local bodies/electors was less than 75 percent which is a requisite minimum for holding election from Local Authorities’ Constituency as per the norm specified by the Commission and upheld by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Election Commission of India versus Shivaji and Ors (AIR 1988 SC V 1). Now, as per the information furnished by the CEO, Uttar Pradesh, the percentage of the local bodies/electors is more than 75 per cent, and therefore, the Commission has decided to hold biennial election to Uttar Pradesh Legislative Council from 35 Local Authorities’ Constituencies to fill up 36 vacated seats…,” read the order of ECI’s announcement of biennial elections dated January 29, 2016.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/eci-to-take-a-call-soon-on-biennial-legislative-council-elections-in-uttar-pradesh-101637864792533.html
25-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi pollution: Delhi govt revives ban on construction after SC order||New Delhi: A day after the Supreme Court ordered a ban on construction across the National Capital Region (NCR) until further orders, the Delhi government on Thursday re-imposed the ban on construction and demolition (C&D) activities in the city and said the labour department is working out a financial assistance scheme to help daily wage labourers affected by the ban.“The Supreme Court had issued an order last night in this regard and considering that, all construction and demolition work in Delhi is being banned again. Plumbing, interior decoration, electric work, and carpentry work will be allowed, but apart from that, all construction and demolition work is being stopped,” said Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai on Thursday, adding that government agencies were already working towards implementing the Supreme Court’s orders to control air pollution levels in Delhi.Noting that the government is keeping a close eye on air quality, the minister said the current ban will stay in place until the situation improves.“We are mentally prepared for everything. If the situation improves, we will consider the prospect of reopening and if the situation worsens, we will take more actions as required. For the past week, because construction and demolition work was halted, construction workers had been facing trouble, so the government has now decided to provide financial assistance to these workers. For this, we will work with the labour department and prepare an outline,” he said. The minister also said that the government is encouraging use of public transport services, pointing out that CNG buses are being used to ferry government employees from highly concentrated areas such as Timarpur and Gulabi Bagh. “Along with that, we are also starting a shuttle bus service for all the nearest Metro stations so that people coming from the Metro can reach the office more conveniently. Trucks entering Delhi from outside, except for essential services and trucks running on CNG and electricity, have already been stopped,” said Rai on Thursday. Construction activities in Delhi were halted for a period of five days, from November 16-21, following which the ban was lifted on November 22.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director-research and advocacy at the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) said all measures listed under the ‘severe’ category and below of the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) are already in place in Delhi, and added that extreme measures such as closure of schools and construction activities come under the ‘emergency’ category. “These measures only need to be taken when forecasts show air quality will become extremely bad in the coming days and stay in that range for some time. However, we already have a number of existing measures in place and it is important to enforce them better. Monitoring existing measures is critical,” she said.Delhi and the National Capital Region, in an annual winter rerun, has been in the grip of hazardous air pollution as a toxic smog lingers over the Capital and its adjoining cities, leading to a public health emergency. This November has also seen the number of farm fires reaching a new high with the enforcement of a ban on the practice collapsing.The city’s pollution levels on Wednesday began to worsen as winds weakened. The air quality index (AQI) was “poor” on Tuesday - for the first time since November 1 - with a reading of 290 recorded, according to the Central Pollution Control Board’s 4pm bulletin. The AQI shot up to 361 — in the “very poor” category — at 4pm on Wednesday, and touched 400, on the brink of “severe category”, according to Thursday’s bulletin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-pollution-delhi-govt-revives-ban-on-construction-after-sc-order-101637864732746.html
25-11-2021||Mumbai||Schools reopening: Some parents keen, some hesitant||Hours after the state government announced its decision to reopen schools for students from classes 1 to 12 across Maharashtra from December 1, reactions from parents and schools ranged from hesitancy and apprehension to willingness. “Since children have been confined to their computer screens for the last 19 months, the decision to resume physical classes, though very sudden, is a good move,” said Dadar resident Shiv Sawant, parent of Class 3 student Sarthak and Class 6 student Sahana from Balmohan Vidyamandir at Shivaji Park. He added, “We also need to mentally prepare younger children to go to school and it will not be possible within a week. If they call smaller children after a fortnight, I will be happier to send my child to school. As of now, I am not sure if they will be keen.” On Thursday, Maharashtra school education minister Varsha Gaikwad announced that classes 1 to 7 will resume in urban areas and classes 1 to 4 in rural areas. All other classes had already commenced. Gaikwad added that the school education department will soon release the standard operating procedure (SOP) for schools to follow. As per information shared by the state school education department, there are 13.4 million students studying between classes 1 to 7 in the state and more than half a million teachers for these batches. While some schools are apprehensive of having the entire lot of students within school premises in view of social distancing norms, there are some schools that say they are prepared. Parents, who are keen to send their children to school, expressed their concerns on the implementation of Covid protocols, while a section showed interest in sending their children to school even if it is once a week, so that they get accustomed to the physical education pattern. “I am comfortable sending my kid to school since everything else has anyway resumed for children. As a parent, it was difficult to manage my child’s transition from pre-primary to Class 1 in the online mode since my daughter was used to being treated as a toddler in school. Now that she suddenly has to write a lot and has homework as well, attending physical classes will be beneficial,” said Thane resident Ashu Jain, parent of 7-year-old Tiana, a student of Rainbow International School, Thane. Jain added, “We have to live with Covid and hence it is important that children also learn how to manage in a pandemic situation. Even if schools start with a non-instructional day once a week, students may find it easier to get used to the routine.” With barely a week for schools and students to prepare, parents’ groups said the reopening date of December 1 is short notice. “The senior classes are functioning well, as the older children are aware of how to follow Covid protocols, but it’s not the same with younger children. Schools will require at least 15 days to a month in order to prepare for the entire school to start functioning. Up to 20% of parents may send their children to school, but others will be reluctant and prefer to gauge the situation,” said Anubha Sahai, president, India Wide Parents’ Association. Some schools feel reopening will be advantageous to younger students. “Due to virtual classes, toddlers have been missing an appropriate environment to learn and grow. Coming back to school is being welcomed by most parents and has also given teachers relief because nothing can replace physical classes. We are anxious but mostly just overjoyed to have our children back in school,” said Kavita Aggarwal, chairperson of Mumbai International Schools’ Association (MISA) and director of D G Khaitan School, Malad. Leena Verma, Principal, St Joseph’s High School, said, “We are following the CBSE board and since we have board exams are currently on, all our protocols are in place and our staff has been trained accordingly. Even if we have to start school within a week, we are completely prepared. We have enough infrastructure to limit to 20 students in a classroom and all other Covid protocols are in place.” While international schools are confident of managing the crowd, state board schools are feeling the pinch. “Each of our batches has three divisions, or 180 students in total. Bringing back young students will require more people on board to ensure Covid protocols are executed well. At present, many of our teachers are still waiting for their second vaccine dose. We are apprehensive about this move,” said a principal of a state board school in south Mumbai. Kshama Valanjoo, assistant headmistress, VPM’s Vidya Mandir High School, Dahisar, said, “It will be difficult to conduct hybrid classes and at the same time maintain physical distance. As of now, we are awaiting guidelines or the SOP to be released by the state government as only that will give us an idea as to how we should plan. Currently, we only have only a third of the students attending school. But we will need more staff and infrastructure when the entire lot starts attending physical classes.” Madhu Singh, principal, Billabong High International School, Malad, said, “We will be following partial resumption or full resumption only after receiving a formal directive from the state government. All main contact points and floors will have sanitiser booths installed; we also have a task force in place.” Dr Samir Dalwai, a developmental and behavioural paediatrician and a member of the paediatric task force that recommended that schools be reopened, said, “With fewer positive cases, this is the appropriate time to reopen schools. When children wearing masks can go to malls and other public places, this should also not be a problem. However, parents and schools should ensure that the transition is slow and smooth, specifically for younger children. The children have been around their parents for almost two years now, and will be clingy and fussy. They will also find it difficult to adjust to the new routine. I would suggest schools to take it slow and not focus on completing the syllabus as it is important for children to get used to the school discipline and lack of screen time.” How to ensure a smooth transition for children By Dr Samir Dalwai, member, state paediatric task force||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/schools-reopening-some-parents-keen-some-hesitant-101637864731586.html
25-11-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram admin should set up CFCs and CSCs under a roof for people’s ease: MCG||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) will send a proposal to the district administration to set up citizen facilitation centres (CFCs) and common service centres (CSCs) under one roof, so residents can avail these government services at one location, officials said on Thursday.MCG commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja announced the development following an inspection of the CFCs in the district on Tuesday, they added.The Haryana government provides such services at common service centres (CSCs), where a citizen can enroll for Aadhaar card, passport registration, get a copy of e-Aadhar, renew driving licence, procure PAN card, take up voter identification (ID) card related matters, widow pension, disability pension, among other such amenities.Ahuja inspected CFCs in wards 6, 13, 15 and 23 on Tuesday, following which, he said that CFCs and CSCs can be brought together at one location to ensure that all the citizens can avail such services of the MCG and other government departments from one location, instead of making multiple visits to various offices. There are at least 18 CSCs within the MCG area.“Placing CFCs and CSCs at one location will be extremely convenient for the people, and I have directed the MCG officials to explore this matter with the district administration. Rather than visiting multiple government offices, residents can now complete their work within their municipal ward in a single visit, which will also help them save a lot of time,” said Ahuja. At present, the MCG has CFCs at 25 out of its 35 wards, and the civic body aims to complete setting up the remaining nine by the next year, according to the officials.People can pay property tax bills, water bills, procure marriage, birth and death certificates among other such amenities at a CFC.“Any initiative that eases the lives of residents is always welcomed. A proposal for placing CFCs and CSCs together will be examined, and its feasibility will be assessed,” said Yash Garg, deputy commissioner, Gurugram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-admin-should-set-up-cfcs-and-cscs-under-a-roof-for-people-s-ease-mcg-101637864672948.html

Hence, there are only 30 such machines at various ward offices presently.Rahul Jagtap, chief of the information and technology department, said, “The Pune district collectorate issues machines as per demand to social organisations and banks among others. We provide machines to hold camps of two to three days.”Another Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) official said, “Based on applications from corporators, schools and social organisations, we provide machines as per availability. We have received more than 15 applications for arranging camps in different wards.”“As per the Pune district collector’s guidelines, Aadhaar machines will be provided only to camps held at government premises such as government- schools, colleges and other establishments such as ward offices etc.,” the official said.Rohini Akhade, nodal officer for Aadhaar, Pune district, said, “We have received applications from local representatives not only from PMC but also Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) and Pune rural. At present, we have a total 350 machines out of which 213 are operating. We have demanded 100 more machines from UIDAI. We have to sort out the applications as per the demands of the corporators. However, the demand of local corporators is more than the others.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/with-eye-on-civic-polls-local-reps-demand-aadhaar-camps-in-pune-wards-101637864671700.html

It alleges Sidhu tweets about the drugs case just when it is to be taken up by high court in a matter where proceedings are ongoing. His act “substantially” interferes with “due course of justice” since twitter is a public platform and he has 9.8 lakh followers. He knows his tweets are widely read and generate huge publicity, the plea further argues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/haryana-ag-defers-hearing-on-contempt-plea-against-sidhu-101637864551177.html

As per experts, the turnout of students has been at least 80 per cent post-Diwali vacation. After classes started in October this year, initially the attendance was only 30 per cent. Teachers note that students should resume offline education to ensure that there is no learning loss.On Thursday, state education minister Varsha Gaikwad declared that schools from Class 1 to Class 7 will reopen in urban areas from December 1.Shubhangi Chavan, deputy education officer for the primary school of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) education department, said that there are no clear standard operating procedures (SOPs) as of yet.“The directives are likely to come soon. The SOPs for safety norms are likely to remain the same. The temperature will be checked, social distancing has to be followed and a face mask has to be worn compulsorily. The question of capacity is still not clear. As of now, schools are permitted to have 50 per cent occupancy. The detailed order will be released soon by the department,” said Chavan.Speaking about the occupancy, Harishchandra Gaikwad, president of the Pune District Principals’ Association said that the decision is welcome.“The decision is important and good for students from all classes. Teachers, schools and students are happy. Classes 8 to 12 should now be allowed with full capacity. So far, the attendance of Class 8 to 12 is also good. After Diwali vacations, the attendance has increased up to 80 per cent,” said Gaikwad.He added that the attendance has increased as many families are returning from their native villages.“As a precautionary step, vaccination for children should start soon. Teachers and schools are taking precautionary measures,” said Gaikwad.Himani Kulkarni, a consultant psychologist at Jupiter Hospital, said that like several other parts of the country, in Maharashtra also Covid-19 cases have not shown a fresh surge.“Due to the pandemic, schools, especially primary sections, have been suspended since April 2020. Though the digital medium helped school students to continue learning. However, school closure brought in mental health issues among children. Healthcare institutions were also witnessing that some parents came to them with complaints of depression among their kids. There will be considerable improvement when their learning exercise comes back to normal when schools resume as per government directives,” said Kulkarni.She added that the pandemic is not over yet and all protocols should be followed by schools such as wearing masks, using hand sanitiser, and or mental and overall, well-being of children, parents and teachers are expected to play a very important role in the well-being of children.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/classes-8-to-12-attendance-improves-to-80-in-pune-schools-101637864491732.html

Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol took cognisance of the objections raised and ordered that the work be halted.Maha Metro project director Atul Gadgil said, “The Ganesh mandal representatives submitted the proposal to erect a hydraulic bridge instead of the existing plan but we gave our recommendations on the same to the mayor. Our view is that it is not technically feasible and that work be allowed to resume as per the previous plan. Now, the elected members will need to take a call on it.”Whereas elected members said that the height of the bridge was decided much earlier as per the previous plan and the same appeared as news.

25-11-2021||Gurugram||GMDA plans to install 42 new air purifiers in Old Gurugram to curb pollution||The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) is planning to install 42 new air purifiers in parts of Old Gurugram at the earliest, which see high pollution levels due to heavy vehicular movement and dust. The move came in a bid to reduce air pollution levels in the areas, said GMDA officials.Air purifiers help in reducing pollution levels in surrounding areas, and 71 such purifiers have been installed in different parts of the city, particularly in new sectors, they added.Subash Yadav, additional chief executive officer (CEO), GMDA, said on Thursday that they are planning to install these purifiers in areas such as Old Railway road, New Railway road, Sheetla Mata road, Palam Vihar to railway station road, Rezangla Chowk, and Old Delhi-Gurgaon road under phase II of the project ‘Air Care’.“We have installed 71 purifiers in several areas of the city, but most of these were in newer sectors across the highway. We will now install these purifiers across Old Gurugram to curb the air pollution levels there,” said Yadav.He also said that these air purifiers are being installed in collaboration with the Indian Pollution Control Association (IPCA), a Delhi-based NGO which is taking care of the installation and maintenance of the same. “Vehicular pollution is very high in Delhi-NCR (national capital region), and that is why the move is much-needed,” he said.IPCA, which conducted a study on particulate matter concentrations near 53 outdoor air purifiers installed by the GMDA, said that the devices were able to reduce dust pollution by 35-50% in its immediate vicinity i.e. in 500 square metres.Radha Goel, deputy director of IPCA, said in a statement that these purifiers are fitted with exhaust fans and work on filtration technology. IPCA will operate and maintain these purifiers for the next three years, Goel said.Air quality experts, however, said that smog towers or outdoor air purifiers -- like the ones installed -- may not be effective in open areas as there are no barriers (psychometric or physical) to control the direction of clean air. “The velocity of clean air from these towers are not enough to hold or reach to a distance with dominant atmospheric resistance factors, and even a wind speed of five to seven kilometres per hour will overpower this so-called filtered or treated air,” said Sachin Panwar, a city-based air quality expert.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gmda-plans-to-install-42-new-air-purifiers-in-old-gurugram-to-curb-pollution-101637864314751.html
25-11-2021||Mumbai||Reopening schools for primary class children difficult, but necessary: Education minister||After a gap of nearly two years, all students across Maharashtra, including primary school children, will be going back to physical school from December 1. The decision to resume physical classes for all students was taken at a state cabinet meeting on Thursday.School education minister Varsha Gaikwad made the announcement after the cabinet meeting. A detailed standard operating procedure (SOP), including the Covid protocol to be followed, will be issued by the state school education department soon. Since October, schools in urban Maharashtra were open for students from Class 8 to 12, and from Class 5 to 12 in rural areas. “The state cabinet today has decided to allow reopening of physical classes in all the schools across the state. The decision was taken after holding a series of discussions with the paediatric task force and others. We have sought a few days to prepare a detailed SOP for the schools and parents and thus decided to resume offline classes from December 1,” Gaikwad said. The task force was appointed earlier this year when experts feared that children might be affected by a possible third wave.Physical classes in schools were suspended in Maharashtra from March 2020 when Covid-19 pandemic hit the state. Offline classes had resumed in rural areas for Class 8 to 12 from July 12. On October 4, schools in urban areas were also reopened for Class 8 to 12 students whereas in rural areas, physical classes have resumed for Class 5 to 7 students.Gaikwad said the state government monitored the Covid-19 situation for 15 days after Diwali before taking the decision. There was a concern that the daily cases in the state may start rising after the festive season, but thankfully that did not happen.While admitting the difficulties in bringing primary students back to school, Gaikwad said it was a necessary step. “It is difficult to compel students from Class 1 to 4 to wear masks and maintain physical distance as they are too young. But it is also necessary to bring them back to schools, because, according to experts, gradually they are likely to go out of the mainstream as they have been at home for the last two years,” Gaikwad told reporters at Sahyadri guest house after the cabinet meeting.“Our priority is to provide a safe and healthy environment to the students. With this in mind, the role of parents and the school management will also be fixed in the SOP,” she added. “In the next six days, the emphasis will be on acclimatizing schools, parents and children towards a safe transition to physical classes, as classrooms have been shut for nearly two years,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/reopening-schools-for-primary-class-children-difficult-but-necessary-education-minister-101637864256026.html
25-11-2021||Delhi||Experts refute state govt’s claim that 39% of land in Haryana constitutes ‘forests’||Haryana, the state with the lowest forest cover in the country (3.62% of the total area), is again mired in controversy with regard to the classification of what and how much land in the state constitutes “forests”.Last month, the Haryana government submitted an affidavit in the Supreme Court (SC) stating that 39.35% of the state’s total geographical area (4.4 million) and 100% of the area in 11 districts of the state is to be considered forest and hence, most buildings in Gurugram and other towns are to be demolished if the apex court’s 2018 judgement in the Kant Enclave matter is to be followed. But now two intervention applications have been filed in the Supreme Court by Aravalli Bachao Citizens Group and Gurugram resident retired Lieutenant Colonel Sadavarman Oberoi respectively, stating that the state government is deliberately misinterpreting the Kant Enclave judgement to overstate the area notified in the Punjab Land Preservation Act (PLPA) by over 50 times to push for an amendment to the act, which would lead to loss of whatever little forest area in the Aravallis that is currently protected.In its affidavit to the Supreme Court on October 20, in matters linked to the Khori Gaon demolition and Satpal and Others Vs Union of India, the Haryana government said that according to the Kant Enclave judgement of the SC dated September 11, 2018, areas notified under sections 3,4 and 5 of the PLPA are to be considered forest area and structures standing thereon are to be considered illegal. The affidavit urges the apex court to consider an amendment to the PLPA issued by the Haryana government on February 27, 2019 that was stayed by the SC on March 1, 2019.“As it is, only 70% of the Aravallis in Faridabad and 60% of the Aravallis in Gurgaon are notified under section 4 and/or 5 of the PLPA (by special order) and are treated as recorded forests as per the 1996 Godavarman judgement of the Supreme Court. The SC was right to stay the amendment in 2019 within two days of its passing. If the stay is removed and the amendment is put to effect, there will be virtually no legal forest left in the Aravallis of Gurgaon and Faridabad. Earlier, the state had said there is nothing called ‘Aravalli’ in their revenue records. So, if there is no forest and no Aravalli, one can guess what will come there – only real estate,” said Chetan Agarwal, an independent Gurugram based forest analyst.The Haryana government submitted that the areas notified under Section 4 and/or 5 (by special order) of the PLPA are treated as legal forest only because of judgements of the SC. Now, the 2018 judgement of the apex court has extended the forest cover from 31,738 hectare (0.72% of the state’s geographical area) to 1.7 million hectares (39.35%). In the amendment bill issued in 2019, the Haryana government claimed that 1.08 million hectares (25%) would become forest. The PLPA has no provision to rectify, amend or denotify the order or notifications issued under it even when there is an inherent defect, mistakes, or certain land has been inadvertently included or found to have been issued in violation of prescribed procedure, said the government in its affidavit. The Haryana government also stated that there is no provision in the PLPA to provide reasonable opportunity of being heard before imposing restrictions and prohibition. The amendment proposed by the government is hence in conformity with the constitutional rights granted under Article 300-A (right to property) of the Constitution.The intervention application filed by environmental lawyer Ritwick Dutta, on behalf on Aravalli Bachao Citizens Group, on November 13 states that wrong interpretation of the PLPA would lead to large scale deforestation in the state and aggravate the environmental conditions, thereby leading to deterioration of both water and air quality, which violates Article 21 (protection of life) of the Constitution. “It is submitted that the affidavit dated 20.10.2021 filed by State of Haryana is not in accordance with the direction of the Hon’ble Court and rather a blatantly misguided attempt to override and negate the judgements of this Hon’ble Court and to justify the amendment being carried out by... the Punjab Land Preservation Act, 1900. In the interest of justice, and the ecological security of the Delhi NCR region, it is important that the real factual and legal positions with respect to the forest in Haryana with special reference to Punjab Land Preservation Act, 1900 is brought before this Hon’ble Court for proper adjudication of the matter,” states the intervention. It points out that the Supreme Court has, in several judgements, dealt with what constitutes forest under PLPA. In fact, an affidavit filed by the Haryana government on December 8, 1996, shows the areas the government considered as forest land notified under sections 4 and 5 of the PLPA. Dutta’s application states that in the Kant Enclave matter, the SC has interpreted that the notification under PLPA is to ensure that there is no non-forest activities, such as cultivation, pasturing of sheep and goats, construction of buildings, herding, etc. in areas notified specially under sections 4 and 5 of the PLPA. “The Supreme Court’s Kant Enclave judgement widened the purview and said even general areas notified under certain sections of the PLPA are forests. The National Green Tribunal also started taking a similar view. Hence, the amendment to the PLPA is very important to secure areas, where we have utilities, HUDA enclaves etc,” said a senior official of the Haryana government, who did not want to be named.The intervention applications make it clear that the Supreme Court only considers those areas--notified under sections 4 and/or 5 of the PLPA by special order --as forests. The areas are village specific and the forest department was already treating them as forests (the department has a record of the exact areas notified as forests). All areas notified by special order in south Haryana are in the Aravalli hills, with the land type recorded as ‘gair mumkin pahar’ (uncultivable land).Under Section 4 of PLPA, there are wide areas which are not notified and are considered to be in the general category, such as entire districts or part thereof like entire Gurgaon and part of Faridabad. One needs permission for tree cutting in these areas. “The figure (39.35%) that the Haryana government is quoting as forest land is incorrect. Since 1964, when the state had formed the forest department, it has maintained that only certain areas notified under special orders under sections 4 and 5 are forests. Section 3 of PLPA is a general section, where restrictions on tree felling may or may not be issued. How did they suddenly discover 39.35% area is forest? The Kant Enclave judgement is pretty clear and there should be no confusion,” said R P Balwan, a former forest conservator of Gurugram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/experts-refute-state-govt-s-claim-that-39-of-land-in-haryana-constitutes-forests-101637864251461.html

25-11-2021||Delhi||Three murders reported in Delhi in one day||A 26-year-old man was shot dead by a man from his locality over an alleged monetary dispute on Wednesday night in south Delhi’s Ambedkar Nagar. Two other murders were reported in the city in Jahangirpuri and Rajouri Garden on Wednesday.In the case of the Ambedkar Nagar murder, police identified the deceased man as one Avinash (identified only by his first name in police records), and said he was a local moneylender, who lent money to one Vicky some months ago. Police are yet to arrest Vicky (also identified only by his first name) and confirm if this was indeed the reason why he murdered Avinash.Deputy Commissioner of Police (south) Benita Mary Jaiker said that police received information from a private hospital about a 26-year-old man who was brought there with a gunshot wound in the head.“Initial investigation into the matter revealed that Avinash, who is a moneylender, had a dispute with one Vicky who also resides in the same locality,” said DCP Jaiker.Around midnight on Wednesday, Avinash, Vicky and some other persons from the locality had gathered at K block in Dakshinpuri. Eyewitnesses told police that the two suddenly started arguing. Vicky then took out a gun and shot Avinash in the head. He was rushed to a nearby private hospital where he succumbed to his injuries on Thursday afternoon.Hours before this murder, police in northwest Delhi’s Jahangirpuri found the body of a 27-year-old man in B block. A passerby had spotted the body and informed the police control room. Police identified the man as Sonu Kumar. In this case, police solved the murder within six hours by arresting Kumar’s younger brother. Police arrested Monu and his two accomplices Tushar P and Sunny after checking the CCTV footage of the crime spot. “Monu confessed that he assaulted his brother and stoned him to death because Sonu harassed his family members. Monu said that Sonu was addicted to drugs,” a police officer, who asked not to be named, said.And before Sonu’s body was found in Jahangirpuri, 25-year-old Hemant Kumar was stabbed to death by two men in west Delhi’s Tagore Garden area. Kumar worked with a food delivery company. Police said Kumar was chased from a local tea shop to his house in L block by the two men, who later stabbed him multiple times in the chest, killing him on the spot.Kumar’s relatives said the two men who stabbed him had a tiff with his friend Nikhil.Kumar’s cousin Deepak said that on November 17, Nikhilhad fought with some men who were drunk and were misbehaving with guests while dancing at a friend’s wedding. The issue had been settled then by the people at the wedding. Deepak said that Kumar had reached home at around 4.30am on Wednesday but left home within minutes after Nikhil asked him to join him at a tea shop.“On Wednesday morning while Nikhil was with Kumar at the tea shop, the two attackers reached there and recognised Nikhil from the (fight) incident last week. They abused him, to which Kumar objected. He did not know that they were carrying weapons. The two men took out their knives and attacked Hemant (Kumar). He ran to his house but they still chased him and stabbed him, “said Deepak.DCP (west) Urvija Goel said police have registered a case and are on the lookout for the men.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/three-murders-reported-in-delhi-in-one-day-101637863952723.html
25-11-2021||Lucknow||Jewar airport project: Parties vie to take credit||Multiple political parties have claimed credit for the Noida International Airport project, whose foundation stone was laid by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Jewar in Greater Noida on Thursday. A similar scramble for credit was witnessed during the inauguration of the Purvanchal Expressway project on November 16. Between them, the two projects are expected to impact politics and commerce in these two crucial regions in a big way, experts said. “The Purvanchal Greenfield Expressway would not only connect eastern UP to the state capital Lucknow but also beyond to the National Capital through the Agra-Lucknow and the Yamuna Expressways. The Jewar airport would provide better access to Noida, Greater Noida residents and an alternative to those from New Delhi and Gurgaon. Purvanchal Expressway would pass through Lucknow, Barabanki, Amethi, Sultanpur, Ayodhya, Ambedkar Nagar, Mau, Ghazipur and Azamgarh while the Jewar airport would also benefit residents of Aligarh, Bulandshahr, Meerut, Agra among others. They are expected to usher in prosperity in east and west UP, the reason why there is an urgency among political parties to claim credit,” said Professor Manuka Khanna of the political science department of Lucknow University (LU). “At the end of the day, the common man wants a party that holds out hope for him. Why would anyone want to miss out in reminding voters that they are the ones behind the development hope,” she said. In his speech, Modi blamed the previous governments in power in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh for delaying the Jewar project and credited a BJP government in the state with originally conceiving it two decades back even as two former UP chief ministers, Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati sought to position themselves as the ones to have envisaged those projects. While Akhilesh hit out at the BJP, Maya questioned the Congress for derailing projects conceived by them in Jewar.Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath sought to dub the opposition parties wanting credit for development projects as “kam aql (dim witted)”. UP minister Sidharth Nath Singh coined the term “credit chor (credit thieves)” to target the opposition. “The Jewar International Airport that was first talked about in 2001 and whose foundation stone is now laid, shuttled between multiple governments from Lucknow to Delhi for two decades. These game changer projects impact a huge population and, therefore, there is this eagerness to claim credit,” Khanna said. “The Congress played spoilsport in the BSP government’s development plans in Jewar by coming up with a Taj International Airport and aviation hub and a Ganga Expressway project connecting Noida to Ballia,” Mayawati tweeted soon after the foundation stone of the Jewar airport was laid by Modi. Mayawati also claimed that the Jewar airport project conceived by her government had been much delayed and questioned the timing of the foundation stone laying ceremony just ahead of the elections. She also questioned the land acquisition policy for the Jewar project. Akhilesh Yadav claimed that he had, along with Jewar, another airport in mind in Firozabad, famous for its glass works and bangles. “Had that permission not been denied, churis (bangles) too would have complemented Jewar. Only the SP would decorate UP,” tweeted Yadav who has been repeatedly accusing the BJP of hijacking development projects initiated during his time from 2012 to 2017. UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh advised Akhilesh Yadav that after 2024, he can use the Jewar airport built by BJP to fly out on a vacation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/jewar-airport-project-parties-vie-to-take-credit-101637863771504.html
25-11-2021||Delhi||Cell formed to coordinate efforts by govt bodies to clean Yamuna: Delhi CM Kejriwal||A week after announcing a 6-point action plan to clean the Yamuna river in Delhi, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday said that the government has constituted a Yamuna Cleaning Cell (YCC) to improve co-ordination among the agencies involved cleaning the heavily polluted river. The cell will be headed by Delhi Jal Board CEO, and will have representatives from five concerned departments including Irrigation flood control Department, DJB, Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), DSIIDC and DUSIB. “Yamuna Cleaning Cell will expedite the projects on cleaning the river and overcome administrative hurdles. Additionally, the Delhi Jal Board will take over the operations and maintenance of CETPs [common effluent treatment plants] to prevent industrial waste from falling into the Yamuna and drainage from JJ clusters will be diverted to STPs [sewage treatment plants] to eliminate untreated discharge in stormwater drains,” Kejriwal said.Kejriwal said that a major hurdle in the way of Yamuna cleaning projects is the complex multiplicity of bodies involved. “We are creating a cell that will oversee the working of all the involved bodies. It will help us in identifying and delegating responsibility, and streamline our projects. For instance, if an issue is being faced because of the electroplating industries or some other polluting works, this cell will have to take care of that,” he added.A government official said the chief minister held a review meeting over the management of wastewater from industrial areas and JJ clusters. Officials say that the mandate of the cell will the monitoring and implementation of the Yamuna cleaning plan and action points announced by Kejriwal on 18th November that include — construction of new sewage treatment plants; upgradation of STP, laying of sewerage network in 1799 unauthorised colonies; desilting of trunk and peripheral sewer lines; Providing Sewer Connections in already notified areas; interceptor sewer project. Currently, there are about 675 unsewered JJ clusters from where wastewater enters the river. A DJB official said that there are 11 CETPs in Delhi which are managed by CETP societies and the water utility will take over their operations and maintenance. However, the process of taking over these facilities has not been elaborated yet.An expert said that the decision to form a unified cell is a positive development, but it should be an empowered body. Jyoti Sharma, head of FORCE, a Delhi-based water conservation and sanitation organisation, said that theoretically it is a wonderful development for the river. “Even in the past, when monitoring committees and cells have been made by court and the green tribunal, we have seen some progress on the ground. We should also involve local community groups and RWAs, which have direct link to river and the outfall points, in the oversight mechanism to ensure accountability in Yamuna cleaning projects,” Sharma said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/cell-formed-to-coordinate-efforts-by-govt-bodies-to-clean-yamuna-delhi-cm-kejriwal-101637863653458.html

25-11-2021||Delhi||Storekeeper, employee at Delhi AIIMS eye centre held for fraud||The store keeper of the Dr Rajendra Prasad Eye Centre at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) has been arrested along with another contractual employee in the case related to fictitious deliveries of medical items at the eye department of the hospital for which money was released without the knowledge of senior officials, Delhi police said on Thursday.Police are probing the fraud which surfaced around three months ago, and have already arrested a 59-year-old city-based trader, Sneh Rani Gupta, for duping the institute of at least ₹13 crore on October 30.Police said the trader’s questioning led them to the store keeper, Bijender Kumar, and the office assistant, Naveen Kumar, adding that investigators are questioning the two to identify more people from the hospital involved in the fraud.Police said Bijender (52) allegedly prepared forged purchase documents, supply orders and inspection notes, and secured the release of payments in favour of Gupta’s firm. Additional commissioner of police (EOW) RK Singh said the purchase documents were issued allegedly using Naveen’s official ID. “All the manual and digital records maintained at AIIMS for the purpose of such supplies revealed criminal misdeeds of the accused in connivance with accused firm,” he said, adding that Naveen worked as a programme assistant at the office of a former chief of the centre when the fraud happened.Narrating the sequence of events that led the EOW to investigate the scam, police said that the scam surfaced in September when the medical superintendent of the Dr Rajendra Prasad Eye Centre lodged a complaint regarding embezzlement of government funds to the tune of ₹5 crore on account of purchase of linen items which were never delivered. Investigators soon uncovered that ₹13.85 crore was lost to the fraud.Additional commissioner Singh said that these items were shown as purchased on basis of forged supply orders. “No actual supply of items took place, and the payment was released to the supplier firm... The account statement of the firm confirmed receipt of payments for items which were never delivered. Scrutiny of the e-way bills revealed that the vehicles, shown as used for delivery of those goods to AIIMS, never delivered the same at AIIMS Delhi on any of the dates mentioned on the e-way bills. Scrutiny of GPS logs of the vehicles appearing on the e-way bills showed locations outside Delhi. This firm was a supplier and in business with AIIMS since many years,” said additional commissioner Singh. The officer said that in response to forged supply orders, the accused firm submitted only invoices and delivery challans without physically delivering the goods. “The receipts of goods were not found in the other registers of general store. Bills were raised by AIIMS staff and was approved without the knowledge of the authorised/competent officials of AIIMS. After getting these bills sanctioned, the money was transferred to the firm’s account,” added Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/storekeeper-employee-at-delhi-aiims-eye-centre-held-for-fraud-101637863471099.html

Statistics say urban vaccination centres have administered about 35% more doses than rural centres. Officials said many villagers got vaccine doses in urban vaccination centres when they visited city areas for some work. “We have but increased focus on villages as in some villages, vaccination coverage was found poor,” said Dr Manoj Agrawal, chief medical officer of Lucknow. Urban vaccination centres had administered over 30 lakh doses and rural centres about 20 lakh. Lucknow has an urban population of over 35 lakh and rural population of about 17 lakh. Dr Agrawal said, “In all, 25 mobile Covid vaccination vans have been deployed that visit villages to administer vaccine to the eligible. Vaccination coverage (first dose) is 87%, and we appeal all eligible people to get both their doses of Covid vaccine whenever due.” “Data revealed that over 32.24 lakh doses of Covid vaccine were administered to beneficiaries between 18 and 45 years of age and 11.62 lakh doses to beneficiaries between 45 and 60 years while over 6.31 lakh doses were administered to beneficiaries above 60 years,” said Dr Abhishek Shukla, secretary general, Association of International Doctors. “No adverse reaction after vaccination is happening now.

25-11-2021||Lucknow||Rajnath Singh: Our heads will always remain bowed before farmers||Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday said his government decided to concede the farmers’ demand for repeal of the farm laws as it wanted to avert the situation from turning unpleasant, adding that “our heads will always remain bowed before annadata (farmers).” This appears to be the first time when a senior BJP leader has spoken up about what led to the withdrawal of the three farm laws. Addressing a meeting of BJP booth presidents of the Avadh region in Sitapur in Uttar Pradesh, Rajnath Singh said despite explanations, when the farmers refused to relent, Prime Minister Narendra Modi showed large heartedness by announcing withdrawal of the farm laws. “I have been born to a farmers’ family and our party considers the farmers as god. One can just see how many times during the regime of Congress and other political parties, farmers were fired at. But we never wanted such a situation. The three farm bills were passed by Parliament but we decided that if the farmers were not ready to listen, let us agree to their demands. Our heads would always remain bowed before our annadatas (farmers),” he said. “In UP, innocent ‘kar sevaks’ were fired at during the Samajwadi Party rule. But, we can neither open fire on farmers nor on Ram bhakts,” Rajnath Singh said, pitching the BJP as a pro-farmer government ahead of the 2022 UP polls. He also referred to the Kisan Samman Nidhi of ₹6000 per annum that the Modi government has been providing to farmers as proof of the government’s pro-farmer tilt.“I was the chief minister when the then farmer leader Mahendra Singh Tikait decided to march till the chief minister’s office. The police officers wanted to stop them. But I said no, we won’t stop them and we allowed them to march till the chief minister’s office,” he said. Rajnath Singh, who had acted upon senior party leader Jaswant Singh for his book praising Jinnah, also slammed the Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav for his remarks on the Pakistan founder. “Where was the need to bring in Jinnah in these elections? There was no need to bring in such a person who was responsible for the division of the country,” Rajnath said, adding that several Muslims have also differed with the SP chief’s remarks. “I wish to congratulate my Muslim brothers for disagreeing with the SP chief’s remarks as all of them agreed that Jinnah was responsible for the country’s partition,” Rajnath Singh said. Rajnath Singh spoke of his recent visit to Rezang La in the high Himalayas in Ladakh and said he decided to undertake the visit as a mark of respect to country’s brave soldiers who guard the borders at minus 20 degrees Celsius. “I had gone to inaugurate the war memorial at Rezang La in memory of those brave soldiers who had laid down their lives to protect the country. Vastly outnumbered, yet, they fought bravely and on coming to know of their bravery I ordered a grand war memorial in their memory,” Rajnath Singh said. “Just as soldiers are required to guard the country’s sovereignty, the BJP, too, is required to give good governance to the country,” he said, adding that he was confident of the party coming to power with a two-thirds majority in the 2022 UP polls. Rajnath Singh, who is a former BJP chief, also praised the Yogi Adityanath government in UP. “Today, there is fear among criminals and law and order was never so good. The government is practicing clean politics,” he said. “We are also running the government at the Centre and I challenge anyone to prove an iota of corruption,” he said.Reacting to Rajnath Singh’s remarks, Samajwadi Party leader IP Singh said, “The BJP is an expert at shifting the goalposts. We saw how after troubling the farmers, comparing them to terrorists and in fact doing everything it could to malign the farmers and their agitation, it finally withdrew the three black laws after realising that the farmers weren’t ready to budge. Yet, such is their politics that they are now positioning themselves as pro-farmers. As for Jinnah talk, why don’t BJP leaders consult their topmost leader Lal Krishna Advani and check out his views on him. The BJP’s credibility is so low that the farmers have refused to believe them until they withdraw the three farm laws in Parliament. Moreover, this government has still not given any assurance on law on MSP whereas we have already promised that when voted to power we would ensure that the kin of those farmers who died during the agitation are each given ₹25 lakh.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/rajnath-singh-our-heads-will-always-remain-bowed-before-farmers-101637861970833.html
25-11-2021||Pune||Mixed reaction from parents; Pune schools seek smooth transition||PUNE As the state government has allowed the reopening of offline classes for Class 1 to 7 in urban areas from December 1, schools say that it is a short period and have insisted on a smooth transition for the students and parents and continuation of the hybrid teaching mode for a while.Parents also are perplexed as the paediatric vaccination hasn’t begun and the Covid-19 cases have been recording a spike in other countries.“I am not sure whether this is the right time to decide as paediatric vaccination hasn’t started. Also, what are the protocols for students coming from other countries? The picture would have been clearer in a month or two,” said Amol Bharati, a parent from the Sahakar nagar area.Deepali Hatekar, a parent in the Kothrud area, raised concerns over adherence to the Covid-19 protocols in the schools.“As a parent I want my son to go back to school but at the same time, we cannot ignore the risk factors. Students will have to eat lunch and use washrooms on the premises. Even in the pre-Covid era, we have seen parents send their kids to school even if they have a cough and cold. Such negligence can prove a lot hazardous in the pandemic. If kids, vaccination would have begun then we would have relief while sending them to schools,” said Deepali.Schools have also pointed out the challenges in following the Covid-19 preventive norms not only in the school premises but also while reaching the schools.“In the city, kids come to schools in a rickshaw and school bus where it is difficult to make them follow the social distancing norm. Also, it is a very difficult task to make the children keep their masks on for three to four hours,” said Bhausaheb Badade, headmaster MES Bal Shikshan Mandir school, Deccan Gymkhana.“Many families have shifted to their native places and arrangements would have to be made before those kids would be able to join the school,” he said.Sarika Babar, principal-director of Clara School in Hadapsar, said that the schools would have to follow the hybrid model of education for a while and a smooth transition is required to shift back to the offline education mode.“We have been receiving a mixed response from parents about sending kids to the schools. Also, many families are still out of town so online classes will also continue. The kids have lost the touch of getting educated in the classroom so we would have to give some time to pupils, parents and teachers to get used to the classroom routines,” said Babar.School education minister Varsha Gaikwad said that the SOPs would be updated in consultation with the paediatric task force as some of the students would be attending the physical classes for the first time.Babar said that in the initial period it is essential that the number of students in the classrooms is less.“That way teachers would be able to control the classroom. Also, it would help to follow the Covid-appropriate behaviour,” said Babar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/mixed-reaction-from-parents-pune-schools-seek-smooth-transition-101637860470704.html
25-11-2021||Mumbai||Couple sells infant to doctor for ₹1 lakh, trio booked||The Ram Nagar police have booked a doctor and a couple for selling an infant for ₹1 lakh. No one has been arrested so far in the case. The three were booked under section 80 and 81 (giving away child without proper adoption procedure) under the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015. According to police, the doctor allegedly convinced the couple to sell their new born child and offered to pay them ₹1 lakh. The couple initially accepted the offer; however, they backed out from the deal later on, and asked the doctor to return the child, the police said. The couple approached the Thane district department of women and child development, who registered a case with the Ram Nagar police with help of few social workers. A police officer said, “The woman (mother of child) identified as Puja Ahire, 28, and her husband Santosh Ahire, 30, are residents of Dombivli. They met homeopathic doctor, Ketan Sony, 34, when Puja was pregnant. Sony suggested that since they are poor, they can sell their child to some needy couple, who will take better care of the baby.” “On November 10, the woman delivered a baby boy. After that, they met the doctor and confirmed the deal of ₹1 lakh in exchange for their child. The couple handed over the baby to the doctor on November 15, near Ganpati temple of Dombivli and took the money,” the officer said. Senior police inspector, S Sandbhor said, “The couple again approached the doctor and asked him to return their child. However, the couple had used half of the amount. The doctor refused to return the baby, after which, the family approached the social workers and district women and child development department. We have booked all three of them and further investigation is on.” Dr Pallavi Jadhav, district women and child development department officer, along with other social workers helped the family get the baby. A police officer said, “We are checking all documents to investigate the allegation made by family and social workers. We are also probing if the doctor was involved in any of such dealings earlier.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/couple-sells-infant-to-doctor-for-1-lakh-trio-booked-101637859871754.html

Recently, when he met his old school teachers and learnt that his school was re-starting, his joy knew no bounds.Singh said, “I am the eldest among five siblings in my family and started working as a ragpicker since the lockdown to help my father, who lost his source of income. Initially, I was awaiting the reopening of schools. But, by December last year, I lost all hopes. I started teaching Maths to my younger siblings as I loved the subject. Now, with the schools reopening, I am happy to just stare at the blackboard and am eager to learn.”Thane Zilla Parishad Education Department informed that more than 80% of the students of Class 8 who had dropped out have returned to the schools from this week. Children narrated their lockdown experiences with their teachers and classmates. Most of them expressed that they were looking forward to returning to school and completing their education.Payal Saroj, a 16-year-old Class 8 student from another school in Bhiwandi, used to work as a cleaner in some of the godowns to fulfil the daily needs of the six members of her family. She said, “I will finally get to use paper, pen and colour chalks for drawing. I love to draw and like to read lessons in the classroom. I want to become an artist and the school will help me to become one. Teachers always used to guide me and I enrolled for the drawing exam too, but could not attempt because of lockdown. Now, I will apply again and practice more. I will have to continue my job, too, to help my family. At the same time, I want to get good marks in exams. This will encourage my siblings to do the same.”An officer from Zilla Parishad said, “All the Class 8 schools started on Monday and 80% of students joined on the first day enthusiastically. We are looking forward to improving the attendance by next week.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/80-of-class-8-students-return-to-thane-zilla-parishad-schools-101637855851856.html
25-11-2021||Other||Patiala mayor suspended; Capt’s grip on Royal City politics gets a jolt||Patiala In high drama inside the municipal corporation House on Thursday, former chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh’s grip on Patiala politics received a blow, with his protégé mayor Sanjiv Bittu losing the vote of the majority of the members. He has also been suspended. The loss of majority is a major blow for Patiala Royals, as Bittu was the only elected leader in the constituency, who had been supporting Amarinder, since the formation of the Capt’s new party, the Punjab Lok Congress.The House has 60 councillors, with 59 from the Congress. Most of them were given tickets on the recommendation of Patiala MP and Capt’s wife, Preneet Kaur. Of the total House strength of 63 (after including the three MLAs), 35 councillors voted against Bittu, while 25 voted in his mayor. Two members of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) abstained from voting. This means that since losing his position as the CM, 35 councillors have shifted loyalty from Amarinder to the Congress party. “With the mayor losing the majority, he has been suspended. Senior deputy mayor Yoginderpal Singh Yogi will take charge of the post till the new mayor is elected,” said Punjab local bodies minister Brahm Mohindra, who also voted against the mayor. He added that the new mayor will be elected soon and it will be a councillor, who has worked for the party.No provision of suspension, will challenge decision: AmarinderFormer CM Amarinder, however, claimed there was no provision of suspension in the law governing MCs. “Councillors moved a no-confidence motion, which was defeated as they didn’t get 42 votes (two-third) of the House strength. As the no-confidence motion was not passed, Sanjiv is still the mayor. If they indulge in any undemocratic way to remove Bittu as mayor, Punjab Lok Congress will knock the door of the high court to save democracy,” said Amarinder, who also voted. Earlier in the day, Amarinder led councillors of his group to the MC House from his residence Moti Bagh Palace in a bus. His convoy was stopped well short of the House, but he walked there to participate in proceedings. His supporters accused the police of picking up two of their members; but they were later releasing to attend the meeting. To avoid any poaching, Preneet had gathered 20-odd councillors at the New Moti Bagh Palace, the Royal Palace of her family, drawing the ire of the Congress high command, with All-India Congress Committee (AICC) secretary Harish Chaudhary sending her a show-cause notice for indulging in anti-party activities, and siding with Amarinder instead of the party.“The Congress is the party of workers, not of any individual. This has been proven today,” said Harvinder Singh Nippy, a councillor from Amarinder’s constituency, who has left his camp and now sided with the Congress.BOX PLEASEPolice refuse entry to Capt’s daughterTempers ran high after police refused entry to senior Congress leaders, including Jai Inder Kaur, daughter of Amarinder. She was seen sitting on stairs outside the main entry to the MC office. Captain’s advisers were also not allowed to accompany him inside the MC complex, with a large police force on hand to maintain law and order. For some time, the situation turned tense when supporters of both groups gathered outside the complex and started sloganeering against each other. No untoward incident was, however, reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/patiala-mayor-suspended-capt-s-grip-on-royal-city-politics-gets-a-jolt-101637855790251.html

Unninayar informed the court that the record pertaining to the case had been complete since 2018, yet it was pending for adjudication.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-hc-fixes-hearing-of-plea-seeking-deregistration-of-sad-101637855370140.html
25-11-2021||Lucknow||SP will give more relief than people can imagine: Akhilesh Yadav||Samajwadi Party (SP) national president Akhilesh Yadav on Thursday said his party will give more relief to people than they could expect or imagine once it forms the government in Uttar Pradesh in 2022.He was addressing his first public rally in Lucknow in the run-up to the 2022 UP assembly polls with the slogan “BhaJaPa hatao, pradesh bachao(oust BJP, save UP)”. The SP’s alliance partner Janwadi Party (Socialist) organised the rally at Ramabai Ambedkar Ground .“We will give more relief to people than they could expect or imagine — from price rise, unemployment, etc,” Akhilesh Yadav said.He said that BJP was headed for defeat in the state and the SP will have a historic victory in the elections.“This BJP government only helps industrialists and capitalists, and metes out step-motherly treatment to the poor and the youth. The quality of education has nosedived under the BJP government. And even if the youth manage to complete their education, then there is a dead end when it comes to employment,” the former chief minister said.Akhilesh Yadav also said: “The BJP government proclaims itself as dumdaar sarkar (powerful government). Then, tell me what did this government do for farmers? It had said that it will double the farmers’ income; it failed. While the reality is you farmers are not able to sell your paddy, you are not getting DAP (a fertilizer), and other fertilizers. Diesel-petrol prices and power tariff shot up like never before. When diesel-petrol prices go up, the prices of commodities automatically shoot up.”He described the BJP regime in the state as of one colour (saffron). “We are taking all colours (different parties and communities) along,” he said.“We brought together all communities and various political parties. We have allied with the SBSP (Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party), Mahan Dal, Apna Dal (Krishna Patel) and you (Janwadi Party-S). We have made an ensemble of different sections of society and the political parties and arranged them in a beautiful bouquet,” he said.Referring to the Janwadi Party (S) national president Sanjay Singh Chauhan’s speech, Akhilesh said that the new SP government will get a caste census, so that backward classes, including Chauhans, can get social justice as per their numbers in the population. Akhilesh Yadav said that the government was taking the three new farms laws back as, otherwise, the farmers would not allow them (BJP leaders) in their villages.“But I say that farmers will continue their agitation till (legal guarantee) on MSP (minimum support price) for crops is introduced. Till farmers get MSP, the SP will continue to support their agitation,” he said.In response, UP BJP spokesman Harish Srivastava.said, “The Jinnah-loving Samajwadi Party chief knows his party’s fate in UP. He is talking more in desperation than anything.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/sp-will-give-more-relief-than-people-can-imagine-akhilesh-yadav-101637855130145.html

Police claimed to have recovered around 9,000 rounds of ammunition, semi-automatic pistols, magazines, detonators and empty shells from different locations during its raids in Bihar, Punjab and Maharashtra, which began a fortnight ago after the arrest of a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) constable in Jharkhand who allegedly supplied arms and ammunition to Maoists.During the raids, 8304 rounds of ammunition, empty shells, detonator and magazines were recovered from the THQ Campus of the 116 Battalion of the BSF in Ferozpur (Punjab), while 909 rounds were recovered from a gang member in Bihar and 14 semi-automatic pistols and magazines seized in Maharashtra. The monetary value of the total haul would run into several crores of rupees as each ammunition sell for around ₹700 in the illegal market, sources said. Earlier this month, Jharkhand ATS had arrested a CRPF jawan and three others in Bihar and Jharkhand and recovered 450 rounds of ammunition of 5.6 mm used in Insas rifles. So far, nine people have been arrested in the crackdown, including BSF constable Kartik Behra, who hails from Sraikela Kharsawan district of Jharkhand and is currently posted as Kot (armoury) in-charge at the paramilitary’s station at Ferozpur, CRPF jawan Avinash Kumar from Gaya in Bihar and retired BSF constable Arun Singh from Patna, police said. AV Homkar, Inspector General (Operations), said, “We have several leads after these arrests. We are working on them and have shared inputs with other agencies as well. Jharkhand ATS has been able to crack down on this syndicate with pan-India network with help from police of other states and BSF officials.”Officials said the ammunition recovered from the BSF jawans in Ferozpur and Patna were pilfered from the force’s armoury. Sharing details, ATS superintendent of police, Prashant Anand, said the arrests were made following interrogation of the arrested CRPF jawan and the leads gathered thereafter. “Retired BSF constable Arun Singh was arrested from Patna on November 16-17 and ammunition recovered with help of the Bihar Police. Following further leads, Kartik Behra was arrested from Ferozpur and searches at the THQ Campus with help of BSF officers led to the recovery of a huge cache of ammunitions. In a separate raid in Buldhana district in Maharashtra, three persons were arrested and semi-automatic pistols and magazines recovered from them. These pistols were manufactured at illegal gun manufacturing units said to be operational on Maharashtra-Madhya Pradesh border,” said Anand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/gun-racket-bsf-jawan-posted-in-punjab-four-others-in-j-khand-ats-net-101637853511094.html
25-11-2021||Pune||Change in ring road alignment to cost MSRDC an additional Rs500 crore||PUNE The Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) has submitted two feasibility reports to change the alignment of the proposed ring road in the eastern and western parts in Pune district. The proposed changes to the alignment are likely to add an additional financial burden of approximately Rs500 crore to the budget, officials from MSRDC said. According to senior officials, two feasibility reports have been submitted to the state government and approval is awaited. Earlier, on September 6, state government had approved Rs26,831.21 crore for the Pune ring road project, to be constructed by MSRDC, including construction and land acquisition costs. Changes in the alignment of the upcoming 170-km long ring road are proposed in the eastern and western part of the project near Bhandara Dongar (hill) and in the Kelawade village in Bhor tehsil, respectively.The initial plan for the ring road to pass through the Bhandara Dongar has now been dropped and an assessment has been made to shift the route of the ring road from the base of the hill. In Kelawade, there was a strong demand to avoid a route through agricultural lands and shift it through barren lands. According to officials both of these changes, if approved, would likely cost approximately Rs500 crore, collectively. “We have sent the feasibility reports. Currently we are focusing on completing the land measurement procedures in the western part. We aim to complete it by Jan 4, 2022, and then the procedure to float the tenders will be initiated,” said Sandeep Patil, sub-divisional engineer, MSRDC. Land measurement of the western part is almost complete. In the eastern part, land measurement in 10 of 46 villages has been completed so far. Of Rs26,831.21 crore approved by the state government, Rs12,175.97 crore has been allocated for the western part of the ring road, while Rs14,655.24 crore has been allocated for the eastern side.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/change-in-ring-road-alignment-to-cost-msrdc-an-additional-rs500-crore-101637853509831.html

The districts having high positivity rates include Akola (2.77%), Amravati (2.56%), Buldhana (2.33%), Sindhudurg (2.21%), Pune (2.07%), Beed (1.79%), Nashik (1.87%), Solapur (1.39%), Palghar (1.34%), Ahmednagar (1.31%) and Sangli (1.09%).However, the officials informed that none of these districts has a positivity rate above 5 per cent, which indicates that the Covid-19 virus is under control.Assuring the same, the state surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate said, “There has been a decline in the overall positivity rate and since there are no districts above 5% positivity rates, it shows the situation is under control.” Dr Awate further added, “We are always focussing on those districts showing high positivity rates and taking steps to bring down the numbers.”Maharashtra has been seeing a decline in the number of new as well as active cases. Currently, the state stands second in terms of active cases after Kerala.Maharashtra on Thursday recorded 848 Covid-19 new cases with 50 deaths.Mumbai’s tally of new cases was 174 with four deaths thus bringing its total death toll to 16,319. The total number of Covid-19 patients right from the outbreak last year has now reached 66,33,105.There were 95,497 tests done on Thursday while the number of recoveries clocked to 974. There are currently 9187 active patients across the state of which Mumbai tops with 2525 patients followed by Pune and Ahmednagar with 1982 and 1068 active cases respectively.The death toll has now reached 1,40,857 with Pune leading with 19,694 deaths followed by Mumbai with 16,319 and Thane with 11,558.Professor of medicine at Grant Medical College and Sir JJ Hospital Dr Wiqar Shaikh cautions that a third wave may hit next year if steps aren’t taken to control the cases. “In immunological terms, this is the thick tail of the second wave which has delayed the third wave. The history of pandemics has shown that there will be multiple waves and hence the third will come next year. The real challenge is to mitigate the effects of the third wave,” said Dr Shaikh. He cited Europe which is witnessing the fourth wave which he cites as a disaster as there has been a surge in cases as well as deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/11-districts-record-higher-than-maharashtra-s-average-covid-weekly-cases-101637853392098.html
25-11-2021||Mumbai||Navi Mumbai, parts of Thane faced emergency power cut on Thursday||Due to excess load on State Load Despatch Centre (SLDC), Kalwa, there was an emergency power cut across Navi Mumbai and a few parts of Thane for around an hour or two on Thursday morning.“More demand by Mumbai region due to increased Air Conditioner load owing to heat and increased load on Talegaon-Kharghar and Talegaon-Kalwa lines, Load Trimming Scheme (LTS) was enabled. LTS is a feature in the power grid to save the grid from blackout. It is an automatic feature where sensing threat to the grid, LTS operates automatically just like fuse or breaker devices in our household electrical and electronics equipment,” Dinesh Waghmare, Chairman and MD, Maharashtra State Electricity Transmission Company Limited (MAHATRANSCO).The average daily consumption for Mumbai is 2,700MW. On Wednesday and Thursday, the demand from Mumbai was around 3,095MW and 3,200MW, respectively. This increased the load on the Talegaon-Kalwa 400 KV line.“Hence, to reduce the load, the smaller lines took an emergency load shedding, thus reducing the load on the Talegaon-Kalwa line,” a TRANSCO PRO said. With a few hours of load shedding, the morning online schools and online work from home were disrupted for many in Navi Mumbai. Class 6 student, Saarah Munshi of Nerul, missed her regular school due to the power outage. “As soon as I sat before the computer for the school, the power went off and I could not attend the school. Later, I got to know that all my friends faced the same issue and hence I understood that the classes would have been cancelled,” Munshi said.Reema Kapoor, an IT professional from Sanpada, had an online meeting with her client when the power went off. “I later switched on my mobile data to finish the call. The power was restored after an hour or so. If not, the work would have been badly affected,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/navi-mumbai-parts-of-thane-faced-emergency-power-cut-on-thursday-101637852970572.html
25-11-2021||Mumbai||Lotus Lake water in Nerul has high amount of required minerals for the lotuses to bloom again, says expert||Environment activists following up on the condition of the Lotus Lake in Nerul have recently conducted a water quality test to understand if it’s healthy enough for the lotus to bloom again.To understand the contamination level and to compare the quality, the activists also collected water from Lotus Lake in Belapur’s Artist Village as well as from a regular tap and tested them.The Total Dissolved Solid (TDS) and pH (Potential hydrogen) levels of the water were tested by a former ISRO scientist, Jagdish Math, based out of Seawoods. It was concluded in the report that the pH value of Lotus Lake in Nerul was lower than the other water samples. This meant that the Lotus Lake had become acidic due to the invasive species in the lake and fertilizers due to Chestnut Plantation. Higher value of TDS at Lotus Lake in Nerul, however, shows that the water still has a high amount of required minerals that gives a hope for faster rejuvenation.“I do not think anything can stop the growth of the lotus in the lake, except for other species of water plants. The water is good enough for the growth of lotus,” Math said.After getting the waters tested, the activists have decided to put the seeds of lotus in the lake but the problem now is that of the water hyacinth growing in the lake.“The water quality is fine, only hyacinth seems to be a problem. If this is removed, the lotus can bloom in the pond as before. To keep the lake clean and safe, the cooperation of the local people is necessary. We will try to plant lotus plants and lotus seeds as well before rain starts,” Dharmesh Barai from Team Environment Life said.The greens will now soon meet Navi Mumbai municipal commissioner requesting to help them get the lake cleaned following which its beauty can be restored.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/lotus-lake-water-in-nerul-has-high-amount-of-required-minerals-for-the-lotuses-to-bloom-again-says-expert-101637851414784.html
25-11-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC upholds death sentence of 30-year-old Thane man for raping, killing 3-year-old||The Bombay high court (HC) on Thursday confirmed the death sentence of a Thane man for raping and brutally murdering a three-year-old girl eight years ago. “The act of the accused is gruesome and is committed in a diabolic manner,” said the division bench of justice Sadhana Jadhav and justice Prithviraj Chavan, while confirming capital punishment for 30-year-old Ramkirat Munilal Goud, a resident of Anand Nagar slum on Ghodbunder Road. “It is a heinous offence. It is unimaginable that a cheerful, frolicking child enjoying with her pet would provoke the feelings of lust in a man who is a father of two daughters and a son,” said the bench and concluded that the perversity in the mind of the accused was apparent on the face of the record. According to the prosecution, the incident took place on September 30, 2013, when the child was playing outside her house in Thane with her pet dog. The girl went missing from the spot, following which her parents search in the area. They found the dog tied in a nearby chawl, but could not find the girl. Eventually, on October 2, her body was found thrown in a mud pond in the vicinity. The autopsy had revealed that the girl had a fatal head injury. On October 3, the police arrested Goud and booked him under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, 2012, for raping and murdering the child. On March 8, 2019, a special Pocso court in Thane convicted him on the basis of circumstantial evidence and sentenced him to death. The high court on Thursday upheld his conviction and confirmed the capital punishment, observing that the autopsy revealed that the child had been brutally sexually assaulted before she was murdered. The cause of death was “death due to head injury with extensive genital injuries.” The bench accepted the argument of additional public prosecutor Mankunwar Deshmukh that the act committed by the accused was gruesome and revolted human conscience, and the brutality itself showed that the question of any other sentence except death penalty was unquestionably foreclosed. The court observed, “In the present case, looking at the monstrous act of the convict, it is apparent that the appellant had not, for a moment thought of the precious life of the child. It did not strike him for a moment that he himself happens to be a father of two daughters. The crime smacks of degradation of a girl child, depravity and perversity of his mind. The child was sexually assaulted in barbaric and inhuman manner. It is diabolic in nature and thereafter, it was a brutal murder which makes it the rarest of rare case.” “The act of rape and the manner in which the child was murdered and abandoned in the muddy pond invites indignation and abhorrence. Hence, the death penalty awarded to the accused deserves to be confirmed,” the bench added. Convict on death row freed Meanwhile, the bench on Thursday acquitted Rahimuddin Shaikh, a convict sentenced to death sentence for raping two women and killing one of them at Belapur in Navi Mumbai in 2012. The bench allowed Shaikh’s appeal, observing that the prosecution had failed to prove his role in the offence of murdering a rag picker and injuring another after raping both of them. He was given the benefit of doubt and was acquitted of all charges levelled against him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-upholds-death-sentence-of-30-year-old-thane-man-for-raping-killing-3yearold-101637850809592.html

While stating that he was a proud father of a daughter and as a trained doctor himself, he said he understood the sensitivities around women and mental health issues. “My statement about the younger generation shying away from marriage and reproduction is also based on a survey.

On several occasions, I was the only commuter in the ladies’ compartment and it was really scary to travel alone. Though no major crime has taken place here so far, the possibility of the same cannot be ruled out. The authorities concerned should take this matter seriously and do something about it soon.”Sushmita Mane, a 28-year-old resident of Ulwe, added, “Both the stations on this line are at deserted places and autos are also not easily available. When I travel alone late in the evening, I call my husband or a family member to pick me up from the station.”Ravindra Patil, senior inspector of NRI police station, said, “Our officials keep patrolling near the station and along the tracks to keep the area under check.

The kathak legend however recently made his first appearance in his hometown.“It was after a stretch of two years I stepped out from airport and I was absolutely determined that I will resume my journey from Lucknow instead of any other place in the world. I was born and brought up here and the aangan where I spent my childhood is now a museum. All those memories are very fresh in my mind! Whenever I reach here, first thing I do is — is bhoomi ko pranam karta hoon,” says the maestro expressing his love for the city. The exponent of Lucknow Kalka-Bindadin Gharana, says, “It’s my majboori that I am stuck in New Delhi but if the state government comes up with anything where I can contribute then I will like to spend my final days here.

He has been lodged in a juvenile home.The girl gave birth to the baby on October 16 in a district hospital, where she was admitted due to medical complications. She returned home on November 5.Five days later, she was back at the local community health centre at Tendukheda with the baby. She told health workers that the baby was ill. When the doctor checked the baby, there was no sign of life. The baby was declared brought dead, said the police officer.The doctors recommended an autopsy to confirm if the baby died due to natural causes as claimed by the young mother.The postmortem report concluded that the baby died of strangulation.Police alleged that the rape survivor confessed during the preliminary questioning.

25-11-2021||Mumbai||Shakti Mills gang-rape case: Bombay high court commutes death sentence of three convicts to life term||Death puts an end to the whole process of repentance, suffering and mental agony, said the Bombay high court on Thursday while commuting into life imprisonment – imprisonment for the rest of their lives – the death sentence handed down to the three men convicted for gang-raping a photojournalist in defunct Shakti Mills compound at Mahalaxmi in August 2013. The high court said the trio did not deserve any leniency, empathy or sympathy, but felt that they should repent till their last breath for their crime. “Although the offence is barbaric and heinous, it cannot be said at the threshold that the accused deserve the only death penalty and nothing less than that,” said the division bench of justice Sadhana Jadhav and justice Prithviraj Chavan while commuting the death sentence handed down by the trial court to Vijay Jadhav (18), Mohammad Qasim Shaikh Bengali (20) and Mohammed Salim Ansari into life imprisonment. “They deserve imprisonment for life i.e. for the remainder of their natural life,” said the bench. “Every day the rising sun would remind them of the barbaric acts committed by them and the night would lay them with a heavy heart filled with guilt and remorse,” it added. The court said the trio did not deserve to assimilate with the society, “as it would be difficult to survive in a society of such men who look upon women with derision, depravity, contempt and objects of desire.” The bench also took into consideration the observations of the Law Commission that the death penalty does not serve the penological goal of deterrence any more than life imprisonment. “We, therefore, feel that a sentence of rigorous imprisonment for the remainder of their natural life without any remission, parole or furlough would meet the ends of justice.” The high court also upheld the life imprisonment punishment of the fourth accused – Siraj Rehmat Khan. On August 22, 2013, a 23-year-old photojournalist was gang-raped in the defunct Shakti Mills compound. Police investigation in the case revealed that a similar incident had occurred on July 31, 2013, when an 18-year-old call centre employee was gang-raped by the same group at the same place. Both the cases were tried simultaneously and on March 20, 2014, the accused were convicted in both cases. The next day, the trial court sentenced the trio in the case of the call centre employee and when proceedings for sentencing in the other case were taken up, the prosecutor presented an application for amendment of the charge – for adding charge under a stringent provision contained in Section 376-E of the Indian Penal Code. On March 24, 2014, the trial court allowed the application and invoking Section 376-E handed down the death sentence to the trio. Section 376 (E) of the IPC was added through the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013, and was introduced following the 2012 Delhi gang-rape and murder case, providing life imprisonment or death sentence for second or subsequent convictions in certain rape cases, including gang-rapes.Meanwhile, the HC, while confirming the life imprisonment sentence of Mohammad Shaikh, 25, an accused in the gang-rape of a telephone operator at Shakti Mills in July 2013, deplored the two-finger test, which the rape survivor was subjected to during her medical examination to confirm that she was raped. The court held, “We hope that the Maharashtra government would take necessary steps to shun all such unscientific and heavily criticised “two-finger tests”. It appears that the state has formulated some guidelines. We expect and hope that the state will strictly adhere to the same.”Shaikh had filed an appeal against the sessions court verdict which was passed on March 21, 2014.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/shakti-mills-gang-rape-case-bombay-high-court-commutes-death-sentence-of-three-convicts-to-life-term-101637844629640.html
25-11-2021||Chandigarh||Grandma’s knitting bag full of warm memories||It’s an ordinary knitting bag, faded brown and of no use to anyone anymore; a bag with handles in which women put their knitting needles and wool and a pattern book, carrying it along fashionably. Now it sits in my cupboard, holding memories, hiding secrets and whispers of a lady who used it. It’s my Naniji’s (maternal grandmother’s); reminding me of her and all that she made and knitted. Aren’t women wonderful? They knit, they sew, they build lives, they persevere and plant and dig roots as deep as they can to stabilise their life and that of their family. This is what she did in the 1950s; a young immigrant lady who travelled from Ludhiana to Ohio, without knowing the lay of the land or the language fluently but she followed the path to her husband. I wonder where do the things go, when the person dies. What do you do with the things, objects that she had collected over the years lovingly from the travels abroad as an expat? It is what life is, our houses are already full, our houses have a certain decor and these old-fashioned crochets or embroidery have no place with the avant-garde or the minimalistic approach to our lives now. She must have sat, huddled with other expat wives, learning how to knit and fix these handles and learning a foreign language. The snow, the weather, the conditions, the food, all different. This sentimentality stems from the fact that I have so much of the dust catchers (as they say) or the silver I have collected over the years or the trolls that I feel are my lucky charm. Who will take them? I wonder where will it go? Life is fluid, transitory but does that mean one shouldn’t buy anything or one should have less desires. Who takes care of the dying objects that remain in a corner gathering dust? I would probably be remembered for the books I bought that would fetch a hefty price from the raddiwala and the empty coffee jars. It saddens and pains me, the weather changes, leaves fall and trees stand tall bereft of their foliage. I go back in time and think of all those who have left their homes and settled in Punjab after Partition to start life all over again. Some went abroad to be pioneers but what remains of them? A speck in history…and now some black and white faded pictures. I tried researching on Google (my answer for everything) but realised that it can’t feel, or be emotive. A life is lived with emotions and feelings and the change in weather has made me accept that it’s okay to be maudlin. It’s okay to feel, to emote and to cry. I keep the books, the journals and her things because she leafed through them and I can feel her. It’s like I try with my grandfather’s sweater and her bangle. Or a muffler that hugs me. I wish for an embrace again. ravneetsangha@hotmail.com The writer is a Jalandhar-based freelance contributor||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/grandmas-knitting-bag-full-of-warm-memories-101637844449272.html

25-11-2021||Mumbai||Delay in admissions to medical courses to cost students their future, say parents||Undergraduate and postgraduate medical aspirants feel left in the lurch as the Supreme Court (SC) on Thursday decided to extend the stay on admissions to All India Quota (AIQ) medical seats. This automatically means admissions to state quota seats are also stuck, leaving lakhs of students more anxious than ever.“The apex court should have allowed interim relief to this batch of students that has already been through a lot including Covid-19, delay in conducting the entrance exam as well as delay in announcement of results. A course which usually starts regular classes by October every year will now start the process only in January next year,” said Dr Alfarooq Raut, a senior medical practitioner and parent of an aspirant. NEET UG results were announced by the National Testing Agency (NTA) on November 1 this year, after weeks of delay due to a Bombay high court stay. Similarly, NEET-PG 2021 that is normally held in January was first postponed to February, then April, and eventually delayed indefinitely due to increasing cases of Covid-19 recorded across the country. The entrance test was finally conducted in September. But admissions post the exam has been stayed by the Supreme Court which is currently hearing a series of petitions filed by students questioning the validity of implementation of EWS and OBC quota in All India Quota (AIQ) seats.The AIQ and state admission rounds are conducted simultaneously because vacant seats in AIQ post the second round are surrendered for state quota.“While admissions are stayed, nothing is stopping the state common entrance test (CET) cell from starting the registration and document verification process for UG and PG medical aspirants. Once the state merit list is announced, students will get a decent idea about where they stand in the state and which course they will be eligible for. The CET cell should not waste any more time,” said Sudha Shenoy, parent and activist.Constant delay in conducting admissions to the first year post graduate medical courses is not only creating trouble for those waiting to confirm seats, but also for those already pursuing PG. In October this year, separate letters were addressed to the Government of India, Chief Justice of India as well as the National Medical Commission (NMC) by several groups of resident doctors requesting that the NEET-PG counselling be started at the earliest.“The constant delay has ensured that an entire batch of PG students go missing from the health sector, especially at a time when we need more support to fight the pandemic. This is unfair to us (resident doctors) as well as PG and UG medical aspirants waiting for the admissions process to begin,” said a senior resident doctor from KEM Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/delay-in-admissions-to-medical-courses-to-cost-students-their-future-say-parents-101637842288127.html

25-11-2021||Mumbai||Before hitting mute for 2 weeks, Nawab Malik fires again at Sameer Wankhede||MUMBAI: Hours before his lawyer promised the high court not to tweet anything against Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) official Sameer Wankhede for two weeks, Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik on Thursday morning tweeted a new set of documents to reiterate his old charge against the official’s family.Malik tweeted a document purportedly issued on 16 April 2015 by a cemetery clerk in Oshiwara for Sameer Wankhede’s mother Zaheda Bano’s burial which identified her as a Muslim. The death certificate issued by the municipal corporation, however, listed her as a Hindu.Nawab Malik said this was another instance of the Wankhede family projecting themselves as Hindus in government records to continue getting benefits extended to people from the Scheduled Caste.Sameer Wankhede declined to comment on the two certificates. “I don’t want to comment on the allegations related to my mother, who is no longer with me. It is really very sad to talk about and remove documents of a person who died six years ago,” the NCB official said.Malik has alleged that Sameer Wankhede is a Muslim by birth since his father converted to Islam before his marriage to his mother. But he used his father’s previous identity to get a job in the Indian Revenue Services (IRS) under the SC category. Wankhede and his family have all along refuted the claim.Malik, the state’s minorities affairs minister, told reporters that the fresh set of two documents released on Thursday backed up his charge that the official and his family abused benefits meant for scheduled castes which can be claimed only by Hindus, not Muslims.“He (Sameer Wankhede’s father Dnyandev) continued the forgery even after his wife’s death. One certificate for last rites and another for government records, so that their government job will not come under danger. It is another proof of forgery,” he added.“The entire Wankhede family has adopted dual identities. They were following all the Muslim rituals but documents were made as Hindu so that they can continue to get benefits of a backward class,” the minister said.The minister, who has been tweeting his attacks at Wankhede for weeks, later told the Mumbai high court that he will pause his attacks till December 9, the next date of hearing of an appeal by Sameer Wankhede’s father Dnyandev Wankhede who is seeking a gag order against the minister.A single bench of justice Madhav Jamdar on November 22 declined to prohibit Nawab Malik from posting documents against the Wankhede family but told the minister to reasonably verify the material before posting it. Dnyandev Wankhede subsequently approached a division bench with his appeal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/before-hitting-mute-for-2-weeks-nawab-malik-fires-again-at-sameer-wankhede-101637842048102.html

Only 5% work on the ROB is remaining, said Thane Municipal Corporation officials.A meeting was held between Kalwa MP, Shrikant Shinde, and TMC officials on Thursday to take a review of the project.The ROB is being jointly constructed by the Railways and TMC. The girder on the railway track of the East-West connecting ROB is laid by the Railways while the access roads are constructed by the TMC.A civic official said, “We have completed the construction of the access roads. Only painting and electric work is remaining. The delay was due to some technical reasons that we have resolved and will be able to open the ROB soon.”The ROB was proposed to close the railway gate at Kharegaon, which the residents of Kalwa had to cross to reach Kalwa Railway Station, leading to accidents. Motorists, too, had a long wait to cross this railway line.Shinde said, “There were some pending dues by the contractor working on the bridge. These will be cleared soon and the remaining work will be fast-paced. We have asked the TMC to ensure that the bridge is open for commuters by December 20.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/kharegaon-rail-over-bridge-in-thane-likely-to-be-opened-on-december-20-101637841509911.html
25-11-2021||Mumbai||BJP legislators call off strike; some MSRTC workers may continue strike||A day after the state government announced salary hike for the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) employees, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislators Gopichand Padalkar and Sadabhau Khot, who were leading the state transport (ST) employees’ strike, said that they are calling off the strike. However, a section of the ST workers, who are firm on their demand on the corporation’s merger with the state government, are expected to continue their stir at Azad Maidan.On Wednesday, the state government announced a salary hike ranging between ₹7,200 and ₹3,600 for the employees of the state transport body, who are on strike for the past fortnight. Padalkar and Khot, who led the ST workers, had deferred their decision on Wednesday and sought more time to discuss with the ST workers, who camped at Azad Maidan.The legislators held consultations with workers at Azad Maidan till late night. However, there was no consensus among the workers. While some were happy with the salary hike, others were firm to continue the stir till the corporation is included in the state government. “We met the workers at Azad Maidan and told them that we have to take a stand after the final meeting with the government. We are calling off the strike. They can remain on their stand as we cannot force them [to end the strike]. We will not oppose whoever wants to continue the strike,” Padalkar said on Thursday.Khot, meanwhile, said that the workers must accept the hike in salary as their victory and prepare for the next “battle”. “We did not announce our decision immediately. We spent a night discussing with the workers at Azad Maidan. We are still with the workers, but I believe that we must accept the hike, and prepare for the next battle,” he said.Transport minister Anil Parab appealed to the workers who are still on strike to return to work. He said that their demand for a merger was primarily to ensure timely payment of salaries and increase in pay, which the government has already done. “I think, they should not stick to term ‘merger’ now. We have given them a hike and assured timely salaries every month. Regarding the merger, they can speak to the court-appointed committee,” Parab said in Thursday. He added that some employees want to resume work. “We will monitor how many employees return to their respective duties by tomorrow afternoon. After that the Corporation will decide its future course of action,” he added.Padalkar said that the workers have the right to not accept the government’s offer and that they cannot force the workers, as it was a spontaneous strike by the workers. “If the government has come two steps forward, then now the workers have to decide whether to accept it or not; it is their right. We cannot force the workers. We had discussions with the employees, some of them are happy with the [salary] hike, while some of them want the merger,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bjp-legislators-call-off-strike-some-msrtc-workers-may-continue-strike-101637841447966.html
25-11-2021||Mumbai||Nawab Malik to HC: Won’t post anything against Sameer Wankhede, family till Dec 9||Maharashtra minority affairs minister and Nationalist Congress Party (NCB) leader Nawab Malik on Thursday informed the Bombay high court (HC) that he will not post anything against Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) zonal director Sameer Wankhede or his family members till December 9. The statement came in response to an appeal filed by the NCB officer’s father Dnyandev Wankhede, challenging the November 22 order of a single-judge bench of the same high court. The appeal is being heard by a division bench. The single judge had refused to grant interim injunction, as sought by Wankhede, but had said that Malik should reasonably verify the material before posting it on social media platforms. Wankhede moved an appeal before a division bench, complaining that Malik continued to post material without verification even after the November 22 order. On Thursday, Malik also informed the division bench of justice SJ Kathawalla and justice Milind Jadhav that he, too, was in the process of filing an appeal against the November 22 order, to the extent of some observations made by the judge against him. Wankhede’s counsel, senior advocate Dr Birendra Saraf, on Thursday submitted that social media had become a platform for anyone to say anything against anyone. While referring to the November 22 order, Dr Saraf said that the judge had observed that the tweets posted by Malik were malicious and the allegations of corruption against Wankhede were made casually. Dr Saraf also pointed out that the judge had on November 12 fully heard both the sides and reserved his orders on the interim application filed by Dnyandev Wankhede in the defamation suit. However, six days later, Malik produced additional documents which were accepted by the single-judge bench. Advocate Karl Tamboly for Malik, however, informed the bench that the documents submitted on November 18 were only in support of those which had been already annexed to the defamation suit and were submitted as there were claims of interpolation in the documents on record. When the court asked what action had been initiated by Malik after he had raised the caste certificate issue of Wankhede in the hearing for interim injunction, Tamboly said that the minister had not approached the caste scrutiny committee nor lodged a complaint. Tamboly also submitted that he was aware of an on-going inquiry, but was not sure if it was pertaining to the caste certificate. On hearing the submission, the bench sought to know whether the tweets made by Malik were only for media publicity after his son-in-law was arrested by NCB. Thereafter, Tamboly sought time to file a reply to the appeal and assured that Malik would not tweet anything against the Wankhedes till the next hearing. The division bench accepted the statement and posted the appeal for further hearing on December 9.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/nawab-malik-to-hc-won-t-post-anything-against-sameer-wankhede-family-till-dec-9-101637841087994.html

The Srinagar police registered an FIR against the truck driver earlier this week.Police said that the complaint was filed on Monday by Wagle Estate resident, Pratik Kochale, a 27-year-old student who also feeds and tends to stray dogs in his area. The deceased dog was one of the strays under his care and was named Shaggy.On November 19, Kochale received a call from one of his friends about a stray dog lying lifeless near Sankalp Bungalow. Kochale rushed to the spot and saw to his shock that it was Shaggy, who had died due to severe multiple injuries. Kochale subsequently conducted Shaggy’s last rites at a temple in the locality.“Following the incident, I got in touch with NGO, We For A Cause, and together we obtained CCTV camera footage of the spot. The footage showed a Mahindra Bolero milk pick-up truck running over Shaggy and then fleeing the scene without stopping to help,” Kochale said.Subsequently, Kochale visited the Srinagar police station with the CCTV footage. He also got in touch with animal rights activist, Nidhi Sawant, who is currently working with the Pure Animal Lover (PAL) Group, an NGO that works against cruelty to animals.“We sought help from Assistant Commissioner of Police Sudhir Kudalkar, who is also a PAL member, and he helped us file an FIR in the matter,” Sawant said.Police registered an FIR on Monday against the driver of the truck, booking him for rash driving and mischief by killing or maiming animals under the Indian Penal Code, along with relevant sections of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act.“We have identified and traced the driver and are conducting further inquiries into the matter. A charge sheet will be filed against him soon,” senior police inspector Laxman Tambe said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/fir-against-truck-driver-in-thane-for-running-over-stray-dog-killing-it-101637838568080.html

25-11-2021||Kolkata||Rising CO2 level taking toll on marine organisms in Sunderbans, say scientists||The rising carbon dioxide (CO2) level in the air is turning the water in the Sunderbans estuary more acidic and taking a toll on marine fish and animals, particularly those having shells such as oysters, clams, crabs and lobsters, say scientists. A team of marine scientists working in the Sunderbans has found that the pH level of water in the estuary, located at the southern tip of West Bengal, dropped from around 8.3 in the early 1980s to around 7.9 in 2019.“While in the western part of the Sunderban, which is closer to urban areas, the pH has dropped to around 7.9 since 1984, in the central part of the delta, the decline is slower and has dropped to 8.2 during the same period,” said Abhijit Mitra, former head of the marine science department of Calcutta University.The acidity of a substance is measured using the pH scale. A substance with a pH of 7 is considered neutral. An acid has a pH of less than 7. The normal range for pH in packaged drinking water as per Indian Standard is between 6.5 and 8.5.At Namkhana in western Sunderbans, the rate of decline is 0.024 units per decade in the pre-monsoon and monsoon times. In the post-monsoon time, it is 0.019 units per decade. At Ajmalmari in the central part of the delta, the decadal decline is 0.012 units during pre-monsoon and 0.017 during post-monsoon.“But in the estuary, this slight decline in pH level is taking the toll. Not only has the population of shelled organisms, such as oysters, clams, crabs, and lobsters, declined, their shell size has become thinner and they have become smaller in size,” said Mitra. He added they have little data from east Sunderbans which is closer to Bangladesh.Also Read: In defence of India’s climate stanceThe population of shelled organisms has dropped by around 35%-40% in the western part of the delta, where the decline in pH is more. The size of Saccostrea cucullata, a species of edible oyster around Kakdwip and Namkhana fishing harbour in the Sunderban, has dropped by over 40%. In the central Sunderbans, the size of the species has dropped by around 20%.Mitra and his fellow researcher Sufia Zaman have written a book “Estuarine Acidification: Exploring the situation of mangrove dominated Indian Sunderban estuaries”.Fishermen working in the Sunderban area too have found that the size of several shell organisms including crabs and prawns has diminished.“It is true that the size of several fish and other animals found in the sea, rivers and creeks of the Sunderban such as crabs and prawns are getting smaller. Earlier we used to get big crabs. Now we hardly get any big ones. Most are smaller in size. But unbridled fishing and catching of these fish and animals could also be a reason,” said Bijan Maity of Kakdwip Matsya Unnayan Samity, the apex body of fishermen and trawler owners.Scientists explained that human blood has a pH of 7.35 to 7.45. Just as the slightest drop (0.2 -0.3 units) in pH level can make you sick, the drop in pH level can also take a heavy toll on sea animals.“Shelled sea animals such as oysters and mussels depend on the calcium and carbonate ions in the water to form their shells with calcium carbonate. But with rising acidity, these carbonate ions become scarcer and more inaccessible to the animals. The result is that they can’t form the shell properly and may become smaller in size,” said Punyasloke Bhadury, assistant professor of biological sciences at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research.Corals need calcium carbonate to build reefs. Acidification of seas would not just corrode old coral skeletons but would also slow down the growth of new ones. The reefs would in turn weaken and become vulnerable to erosion.“Ocean acidification is a part of global warming and climate change. The biggest example of corals getting affected by all these is bleaching. Corals are very sensitive to their surroundings and the slightest difference would affect them. The only way to reduce this is to limit the carbon footprint,” said Chowdula Satyanarayana, a scientist working on corals.But it is not just the Sunderban alone where the pH level has dropped. Mitra and his team of researchers have found that such changes are also going on in other estuaries too.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/rising-co2-level-taking-toll-on-marine-organisms-in-sunderbans-say-scientists-101637837548187.html
25-11-2021||Pune||Taste of Life: Dealing with “tikka” by introducing exotic varieties of groundnuts||The decline in the export of groundnut seed from the port of Bombay flummoxed the Bombay Chamber of Commerce and the Agricultural Department in 1900. The largest export was in 1894-95 when 78,488 tonnes of groundnuts were shipped. In 1902-03, the amount had fallen to 2,890 tonnes, and this once important trade had practically ceased to exist.The trade figures collected from Poona in 1900 showed a rapid decline in the surplus available for export, and a district inquiry indicated that the crop had ceased to be profitable and that the area sown was rapidly contracting.The Chamber attributed it to a degeneration of the locally-grown seed. But there was no valid evidence then of any degeneration in the quality of the Indian stock. The plant was a native of South America and had been introduced into India in the 16th century. A number of races developed in India in the course of time, and what was commonly referred to as the “indigenous variety” in India was actually of Brazilian origin.Analyses of the seed made in 1838 and 1904 did not show any appreciable difference in the oil content and no evidence whatever was obtainable to show that the indigenous races had deteriorated as regards quality. But there appeared to be no doubt that the yield per acre had fallen off considerably.Sir W Thiselton-Dyer, director of the Royal Gardens, Kew, sent a representative to Poona and a few sites in the Madras Presidency and opined that the “degeneration of the seed” was a facile theory which was continually advanced when the production of a crop was disappointing. According to him, the real explanation of the falling off was to be found in the exhaustion of some constituent of the soil.A succession of unfavourable seasons had no doubt helped to increase the unpopularity of the crop, but this reason was insufficient by itself to explain the prolonged period of depression which was experienced not only in Bombay and Poona but in the much larger trade of Madras and Pondicherry.It was soon evident that the crop was suffering very severely from a disease, locally known as “tikka,” which was determined to be due to the fungus Septogloeum arachidis.Septogloeum arachidis was first described in 1898 when it was discovered attacking the immense fields of groundnuts grown in Java. These fields were often entirely wiped out by the disease. A similar attack of the disease had happened in Germany, East Africa and Ceylon (now Sri Lanka).The disease had now made its presence known in the Bombay Presidency. It struck when the plants were from one to two months old. The lower leaves were the first to be attacked; dark spots, surrounded by a bright yellow ring, came out in large numbers on the green leaves; a few also occurred on the petioles and stem.The leaf slowly lost its green colour and fell to the ground. After the disease had been in progress for a week or two, affected plants could be recognised by the litter of fallen leaves around their base.Naturally, when the attack began early, the plant was unable to mature its nuts. Those that had begun to form as the attack reached its height, ceased development, and at harvest were found shrivelled and loose in the shell.To combat the disease, experiments were carried out at the Kirkee farm owned by the Agricultural Department. Steeping the seed with various fungicides did not prove successful in checking the disease. The fungus was not found on any other plant than groundnut.In those cases where the disease had appeared in localities where the crop was previously unknown, it was probable that it was introduced with the soil adhering to the shell, and not with the seed themselves. It was found that the subsequent spread was largely affected by the wind.The Bombay Chamber of Commerce then advocated the expediency of importing a new and better quality, such as was reported to be grown in Mozambique and Senegambia, in the hope of obtaining kinds which would yield well, even in the presence of the disease.The first importation was in 1901 when one tonne of Pondicherry seed was obtained from Madras and distributed in Poona and Satara districts. The Pondicherry variety was of Mozambique origin, introduced into Madras, via Mauritius. The same year small quantities of “Spanish peanut” and “Virginia” varieties were obtained from the USA and of “Small” and “Large” Japanese from Japan. These were grown on the Kirkee and Surat farms.The next year, the seed of all these kinds was distributed in the same districts as the previous year. Tikka appeared in August, the variety first attacked at Kirkee being Spanish peanut and at Manjari the “Small” Japanese. At Surat, tikka did not affect the yield where the Pondicherry variety was grown. This established the importance of varieties that matured their nuts early. It was then decided that the Pondicherry variety would be given preference, since though similarly affected by tikka, the damage done was much less, as the nuts were formed by the time the crop was attacked.The experiments continued for the next four years, and every year thousands of tonnes of exotic seeds were introduced in the districts of Maharashtra. As a result of this work, the exotic varieties, especially the Pondicherry variety took permanent hold in almost all the districts of the state. In the Poona district, the indigenous were preferred to the exotics in the local market, being almost entirely grown for eating raw.The crop soon spread from Madras to Gujarat, and gradually to a wide swath of states all the way down to the southwest of India. The variety, subsequently named Coromandel, has since dominated the production of groundnuts all over India.By 1912 no specimens of tikka disease from Bombay and Poona were received in the Mycological Laboratory at Pusa.Coincident with the introduction of the exotics and the disappearance of tikka, the exports of groundnuts from Bombay began to increase. In just ten years, they rose to 48,800 tonnes. The recovery was almost as phenomenal as the decline previous to 1902.The experiment made scientists in Poona and elsewhere realise that a field crop was not in any sense a unit; that it consisted of a complex of races responding differently to the environment (in which must be included disease)and that the composition of the complex might be profoundly modified, especially if crossing occurred, by the introduction of new kinds, or by the growth of a variety in a new environment; and that there was no means of knowing whether the disease might not, in itself, had brought about the establishment of a crop resistant to its effects, by killing out those constituents of the varietal mixture which were most susceptible to its attack.The case is one of considerable interest, as being one of the few recorded in which a serious crop disease was checked by the introduction and acclimatisation of exotic varieties.Chinmay Damle is a research scientist and food historian.

25-11-2021||Bangalore||Jarkiholi case: Bengaluru top cop, 2 others move HC against lower court order||Bengaluru police commissioner Kamal Pant and two other officers moved the Karnataka high court a day after a lower court on Tuesday ordered a probe against them for allegedly delaying the filing of a First Information Report (FIR) against former minister Ramesh Jarkiholi in an alleged sexual harassment case.Adarsh R Iyer, who filed a private complaint in the lower court, said he approached a police station to file a complaint against the officers on March 17 for the delay but no action was taken. Subsequently, he unsuccessfully took up the matter with deputy police commissioner (Central) MN Anuchet on April 1. “The delay from the officers to file an FIR (against the minister) based on the complaint of social activist Dinesh Kallahalli amounts to a case under Section 166A (public servant disobeying direction under the law) of the IPC (Indian Penal Code). I approached the court seeking action against officers under this section as police did not respond to my complaints.”In their petition in the high court, Pant, Anuchet, and B Maruti, the police station in-charge, argued that the lower court passed the order without mentioning whether Iyer’s allegations would amount to action against the officers. The plea said an FIR is registered based on the complaint given by the victim.Also Read: Congress candidate in Karnataka MLC polls declares assets worth ₹1,743 croreThe high court is likely to hear the matter on Thursday. Jarkiholi was forced to resign as a minister in March when Kalahalli lodged a complaint of sexual harassment and exploitation against the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party leader. Kalahalli withdrew the complaint within five days. He claimed he was distressed by the allegation that he had lodged the complaint for money. Police did not register an FIR saying the woman, who was allegedly harassed has to appear before them. They subsequently dropped the investigation.On March 11, Karnataka home minister Basavaraj Bommai announced the formation of a Special Investigation Team to probe the case. The woman later filed a complaint through her lawyers, as police insisted that an FIR will be filed only based on her complaint.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/bengaluru-top-cop-two-other-officers-move-hc-against-lower-court-probe-order-101637836947949.html

Bittu is the only elected leader to have stood by Capt Amarinder after he was removed from the chief minister’s post by the Congress, making the trust motion a tug of war between the Congress and the Captain. The Congress has deputed deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, local bodies minister Brahm Mohindra and rural development minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa for ensuring the removal of Bittu. Mohindra held a meeting with councillors and the district administration. Nearly a week after 42 of the 60 councillors of the Patiala municipal corporation sent a requisition to him expressing their no-confidence, mayor Bittu decided to hold a general House meeting to prove his majority at 4pm on November 25. As MLA, Capt can vote in no-trust motion For the past four days, Captain’s wife and Patiala Congress MP Preneet Kaur has kept nearly 20-odd councillors at her house, to avoid any poaching. Captain, who is also the Patiala MLA, is ex-officio member of the General House and has the right to vote in the no-confidence motion. A protégé of Captain Amarinder, Bittu has been facing rebellion from fellow councillors over his proximity with the former CM. Of the 60 seats in the House, 32 are in Captain’s constituency, 26 in local bodies minister Brahm Mohindra’s Patiala (rural) constituency and two in Sanaur. Two councillors close to Capt Amarinder were picked up by the police when they were headed for voting on Thursday evening. Mayor Bittu alleged that the government was using police force to remove him.As the Captain floated the Punjab Lok Congress recently, a majority of the councillors decided to remain with the Congress. As Preneet is doing spade work to help Bittu, the Congress has issued a show-cause notice to her for anti-party activities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/congress-vs-captain-in-patiala-amarinder-to-mayor-s-rescue-101637835867677.html

He was accused of parking his black money in accounts of bogus firms and family members. Pehalwan joined the Punjab Mandi Board as a junior engineer in 1993. He became a superintending engineer in GMADA in 2014 and officiated as a chief engineer there from 2016. In September 2019, the VB attached 59 properties of the former GMADA chief engineer, amounting to ₹26 crore on the orders of a Mohali court. The VB has filed four challans against Pehalwan and others in the case. According to the VB probe, Pehalwan had registered three fake companies in the name of family members and made transactions of hundreds of crores through banks. During his GMADA stint, he formed a fake construction company, Ek Onkar Builders and Construction Pvt Ltd, and illegally allotted tenders, thereby amassing illgotten money to the tune of ₹400 crore. He also bought properties in Ludhiana, Ropar, Mohali, and Chandigarh, amounting to ₹26 crore with the money. The vigilance case against him and others was registered under Sections 420 (cheating), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 13 (1) (d) read with 13 (2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ed-raids-punjab-s-fastway-cable-network-owner-gurdeep-singh-101637823629099.html
25-11-2021||Mumbai||Shakti Mills gang rape case: Bombay HC sets aside death penalty for 3 convicts||The Bombay high court on Thursday commuted the death sentence handed down to three men convicted of gang-raping a 23-year-old photojournalist at Mumbai’s defunct Shakti Mills compound in August 2013 into life imprisonment while upholding life term for the fourth convict.A sessions court in March 2014 sentenced Vijay Jadhav, Mohammad Qasim Shaikh Bengali and Mohammed Salim Ansari to death. This was the first of its kind sentence under the new rape law enacted following the 2012 gang rape and murder of a Delhi student. The amended law provided for the death sentence to repeat rape convicts. The three were also sentenced to life imprisonment for gang-raping a 19-year-old call centre employee at the same place in July 2013. The fourth convict in the case, Siraj Rehman, was sentenced to life.A high court division bench of justices Sadhana Jadhav and Prithviraj Chavan was hearing the confirmation reference case and appeal against the sessions court order since October.Advocates Yug Chaudhry and Payoshi Roy, who represented the convicts, argued the trial court wrongly applied Section 376 E of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), which says a repeat rape offender will have to be imprisoned for the rest of life or sentenced to death. They argued the section provides for the death penalty to a repeat offender convicted for offences punishable under IPC Sections 376, 376 A and 376 D. They said the trials in both the cases of rape were held simultaneously. The lawyers said the trial court passed the conviction order in both cases on the same day. They added punishment was pronounced in the call centre employee rape case and the prosecution was accordingly allowed to charge the convicts under Section 376 E in the second case.Also Read: Former UP minister Gayatri Prajapati, 2 others get life term in gang rape caseChaudhry argued section 376 E can be applied only if convicts have once undergone a sentence and not reformed despite having the opportunity to reform. He added this was not so in the case of the three.Principal sessions court judge Shalini Phansalkar-Joshi awarded the maximum punishment to the three basing the decision on the extent of cruelty. “Conviction cannot be dependent on the social and the economic status of the victim or the accused and the race, caste, creed of the accused cannot be taken into consideration,” she said.Chaudhry submitted the trial was conducted in an unfair way with the inadequate opportunity to the defence to make submissions on framing of charge under section 376E and on the quantum of sentence after conviction.The defence lawyers said the convicts were deprived of basic fundamental rights, pointing to their impoverished backgrounds. They added their socio-economic circumstances led the men to be violent and commit such an offence, therefore, their sentence be commuted.The defence lawyers said the convicts were young and were not subject to any correctional influence earlier. They argued, therefore, they do not deserve the death sentence. The state government opposed the contentions and said the trial court order was justified and the death sentence be confirmed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/shakti-mills-gang-rape-case-bombay-hc-sets-aside-death-penalty-for-3-convicts-101637823507577.html

In the first phase, the civic body installed RFID system at 13 border points in January 2019. The civic body was expected to equip 10 additional border entry points of the capital with boom barriers and RFID infrastructure by January 2021.A senior South Delhi Municipal Corporation official said the expansion will require at least ₹11-12 crore, and the civic body has no funds for the project. “The phase-1 of the project was implemented using Rs120 crore collected as environment compensation charges (ECC), on the directions of the Supreme Court and Environment Pollution (Prevention & Control) Authority (EPCA). The Commission For Air Quality Management directed to implement the second phase of the project, but there is no clarity on funding” an SDMC official said asking not to be named.Delhi has 124 border entry points of which only 13 has RFID tag system. Hand-held devices are used at other points to collect toll tax and ECC.On August 14, 2020, the South Delhi Municipal Corporation -- the nodal agency to implement RFID project -- announced that all toll plazas will get hand held devices to read RFID chips by November 2020, and proper tag infrastructure will be installed at ten additional border points by January 2021.SDMC commissioner Gyanesh Bharti, in his budget speech on Tuesday, said 111 border entry points have hand held devices for toll collection, and a central control room has been set up in Moti Nagar to all major entry points. “The control room detects the vehicles which attempt to bypass the system without paying toll tax and ECC,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/mcds-cash-shortage-delays-rfid-lanes-at-city-border-toll-points-101637796539240.html

In a letter issued to the assistant town planners (ATPs) of all four zones, Bindra also directed officials to conduct a fresh survey and include other hotels with building violations in the list of violators. Of the 102 hotels on the town planners’ radar, 25 fall in Zone A, nine in Zone B, four in Zone C and 64 in Zone D. In 2018, RTI activist Rohit Sabharwal had moved court against 109 hotels with building violations.

As many as 102 hotels had been identified in the survey that ensued. The RTI activist alleged that the civic body was loath to take action against parking violations. “Many prominent hotels are included in the list of violators and the matter is sub-judice in the high court, but the authorities are still turning a blind eye to the issue,” he said. Bindra said that MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal had sought an action-taken report, following which the report was summoned from ATPs. “As the ATPs have not yet submitted the report, a reminder has also been forwarded.

25-11-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: No water, no votes, say protesting Dugri residents||Grappling with erratic water supply for 15 years, residents of Dugri village have threatened to vote against the Congress in the upcoming assembly elections should the issue continue to persist. Staging a protest on Wednesday, the residents of Ward 43 said Congress councillor Reet Kaur and halqa in-charge Kamaljit Karwal had failed to pay heed to the problem. The residents have also apprised the chief minister, cabinet ministers and the mayor of the issue and their decision. The residents urged the chief minister have the issue resolved or they will not vote for the Congress candidate from Atam Nagar constituency. The issue is being faced in around 50 houses on two streets. Residents say supply to the area is disrupted every two to three days, and they have to borrow water from residents on neighbouring streets. A resident, on condition of anonymity, said, “The municipal corporation is prompt to deliver the water-sewer bills, but not so much in streamlining the water supply.” A protester, Jaswinder Kaur, said, “ We have to bring water from neighbours in buckets. Tall promises are made during election season, but there is no follow through. As Congress is in power in the state, and our ward is also represented by a Congress councillor, the party and its representatives are accountable. We will not vote for them, if the problem is not resolved, and Congress leaders should also not come to the area seeking votes.” Residents say that whenever the matter is raised before councillor Reet Kaur and her husband Rupinder Pal Sheela, they tell them to contact Karwal. “However, Karwal fails to come through, and his staff is rude to us,” they said. Another resident, Nirmal Kaur, said that a new tubewell had been installed in the area a few months back, but it was not being operated. “If it is operated properly, the problem will be resolved, but the councillor is turning a blind eye to the issue.” Despite, repeated attempts, Congress halqa incharge Kamaljit Karwal remained unavailable for comments. Councillor Reet Kaur’s husband Rupinder Singh said, “A tubewell was specially installed in the area a few months ago to resolve the issue as these houses are situated at a certain height above the ground level. However, the tubewell supplied saline water and residents started falling ill, which is why its use was discontinued. We are trying to find another solution.” In turn, Rupinder slammed MLA Simarjeet Singh Bains for not paying attention to the residents’ issues. Residents paying monthly water supply charges to neighboursWith authorities failing to ensure regular water supply, residents have started paying their neighbours who have submersible pumps installed in their respective houses for the service. One of the residents, Binderjit Kaur said,” We are paying ₹2,000 per month to our neighbours who have got a submersible pump installed in their house. Water is supplied to our house through a pipe. We have submitted repeated complaints with the councillor, but to no avail.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhianano-water-no-votes-say-protesting-dugri-residents-101637792187387.html

Officials say the survey will go on till Wednesday evening, and more such connections will be detected. Over ₹50 lakh has been recovered from violators for regularising the connections under the OTS policy.The mayor had ordered a door-to-door survey in the city on November 9 after the OTS policy garnered a poor response. Under the OTS policy floated by the state government on August 25, residents could get their connections regularised at nominal rates (less than 10% of the regular fee) till Wednesday. Now, residents will have to pay a 100 % penalty on the concessional fee imposed under the policy, if they get the connection regularised till February 24. After that, normal rates will be applicable.Under the policy, residents were also given a chance to submit their pending water-sewer arrears without interest and penalty till Wednesday. The policy said that no penalty or interest will be charged on principal amount if the payment of pending user charges is made within three months (till November 24) of the notification, while only penalty will be waived off if the amount is paid after three months but within six months (till February 24). After six months, the user will have to pay both penalty and interest on the pending amount and the connection will also be disconnected on non-payment of dues. Superintending engineer,Rajinder Singh said residents can still get their connections regularised under the policy, as even after imposing 100% penalty, the fee is far less than the normal fee for getting the connections regularised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/11000-illegal-water-sewer-connections-detected-in-15-days-in-ludhiana-101637789665405.html

To pass the no-confidence motion, the mayor needs support of one-third councillors.

Amarinder had resigned as the Punjab chief minister on September 18 after a bitter tussle with Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu and revolt by four ministers and several party legislators in the state Congress. The two-time former CM quit the Congress on November 2 and announced his separate party, Punjab Lok Congress, hinting at a “seat arrangement” with the BJP. In the notice, Choudhary said they have been continuously receiving reports from Congress workers, MLAs, leaders from Patiala and the media for the last many days about her anti-party activities. “This information and news has been coming ever since your husband Capt Amarinder Singh Ji resigned from the party and floated his own party. We are also made aware of your open announcements in the media about siding with your husband’s party,” reads the notice. Kaur did not respond to calls. However, sources close to her said that she has not received the notice so far. Kaur, while talking to reporters at an event in Samana on Sunday, had indicated that she may join the political party being set up by her husband. “Capt Amarinder Singh has always stood by the commitment he makes. Main apne parivaar de naal haan (I am with my family),” she said in response to a query whether she would join her husband’s political outfit. The notice was issued by the Congress to the four-time Lok Sabha member hours before the crucial general house meeting of the Patiala Municipal Corporation, scheduled for Thursday, to decide the fate of city mayor Sanjiv Bittu. Of the 60 municipal councillors, 42 had sent a requisition to Bittu, a Captain loyalist, more than a week ago, expressing their lack of confidence in him. A senior Congress leader claimed that Kaur has been openly mustering support for Bittu and even went with some councillors to meet Capt Amarinder after he had quit the party and slogans were raised in his (former CM’s) support. “This has not gone well with the party leadership,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/congress-notice-to-amarinder-s-wife-preneet-kaur-over-anti-party-activities-101637786786908.html

Raising slogans, Wahid Mohammed, a protester, said that chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi passed an Act in the Punjab assembly on November 11 and announced to regularise a total of 36,000 employees but the department has not received a copy of the Act so far.

25-11-2021||Chandigarh||Arvind Kejriwal’s pre-poll promises are mere ‘lollipops’: Navjot Sidhu||Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu on Wednesday hit out at Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, saying the latter’s pre-poll promises were mere “lollipops”. This come s a day after Kejriwal praised the Congress leader for raising issues against his party government in Punjab. Sidhu, who was in Amritsar for the inauguration of development works to the tune of ₹24 crore, “If you give a lollipop of 26 lakh jobs to people, it means that if you will have to pay ₹30,000 per employee. For this, you need ₹93,000 crore. Then for giving ₹1,000 for every woman will require ₹12000 crore. Also, ₹3,600 crore is needed for free power up to 2 kW connections. These three announcements (by Kejriwal) require ₹1.10 lakh crore where Punjab’s total budget is ₹72,000 crore.”He said their Punjab model is about filling the state’s coffers. “I also praise him (Kejriwal) as he has done good work in Delhi. But Punjab and Delhi are different. Delhi is self-dependent while Punjab has a debt of ₹7 lakh crore,” he added. Taking a jibe at former CM Amarinder Singh, Sidhi said those who attack CM Charanjit Singh Channi were playing in the hands of Prime Minister Narendra Modi like puppets due to fear of the Enforcement Directorate (ED). “CM Channi’s intent is right. What they couldn’t do in four years, he has done in three months,” he said.‘People won’t fall prey to populist schemes’Also in a series of tweets, Sidhu said people would not fall prey to populist schemes without a policy framework and defined budget allocations. He said the state needed a policy-based structural transformation of its economy. “Schemes are just made to take credit, a fast-paced reaction to popular demands, without thought of governance and economy. True leaders will not give lollipops but will focus on building foundations of society and economy,” he said. The comments came days after Kejriwal and Channi announced populist promises and concessions in the run-up to the assembly polls. On Monday, the Punjab CM had also announced capping of cable TV connection rate at ₹100 per month. Without directly referring to Channi’s announcement, Sidhu said he introduced the Punjab Entertainment Taxes Bill to end to strengthen local operators and end one firm’s monopoly, making it pay due taxes to government and then transfer the benefit of cheaper connections to people. “Sops will empty the state treasury and kill livelihoods and do nothing to truly uplift the poor and eradicate tyranny of multiple-system operators such as FastWay,” he claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/arvind-kejriwal-s-pre-poll-promises-are-mere-lollipops-navjot-sidhu-101637785647178.html
25-11-2021||Chandigarh||Cable connection for ₹100 not feasible, say Punjab operators||Cable operators from Punjab on Wednesday criticised chief minister Charanjit Channi for his statement on capping cable charges at ₹100 per connection. Addressing a press conference, president of the Cable Operators Union, Punjab, Sunny Singh Gill said regulating the prices of cable networks was out of the purview of the state government as only Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has the right to fix these rates. “If the chief minister is sure that state government can do so, he should immediately ask his officials to issue a notification in this regard,” he said. The operators said chief minister’s statement will further deteriorate the already dying cable industry. “As per the TRAI regulations, ₹130-plus GST is being fixed that we can charge from customers for free-to-air channels. Out of this, 45% ( ₹65) belong to cable operators whereas rest goes multi-system operator (MSO). We have to bear all expenses right from the level of manpower to operating and the cable network,” he said. The operators said that if a customer wants to see any paid channel, of 10% of the amount goes to cable operator and the MSO each whereas rest of the money goes to the channels. “This means if any customer is having package of ₹300, a cable operator on an average earns ₹80-85. Now, can the state government tell is it viable to cap the fee at ₹100,” he questioned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cable-connection-for-rs-100-not-feasible-say-punjab-operators-101637785585161.html

The communication in this regard was issued on Wednesday to varsity’s teaching departments, its regional centres and constituent colleges. The development comes at a time when PU is functioning without a senate, which is varsity’s apex governing body, and syndicate. According to the PU calendar, the executive government of the university will be vested in the syndicate.“As per the authorisation given by the syndicate on February 27, 2016/March 14, 2016 (paragraph 49), the competent authority has constituted a ‘Grievance Redressal Committee’ on the pattern of standing committee, to consider the grievances of university employees, on behalf of the syndicate,” reads the communication issued by the varsity.In 2016, while considering the recommendation of the standing committee regarding the refixation of date of placement in lecturer selection grade/associate professor of a varsity teacher, PU syndicate had resolved that the V-C be authorised to constitute a grievances redressal committee to consider the grievances of PU employees, on the behalf of the syndicate. The members of the newly formed panel, which is headed by dean university instruction (DUI), include professor Sukhbir Kaur, president of Panjab University Teachers Association (PUTA) Mritunjay Kumar and professor Rattan Singh of UILS among others.The communication issued by PU stated that all such cases (grievances) of the employees to be received in future will be placed before the committee to examine and give its recommendations for consideration by the authorities.Mritunjay Kumar said, “Although I have not gone through the circular yet, rather than forming such committees, it is better if PU speeds up the constitution of senate and syndicate.”Although the term of the last syndicate ended in December last year, no fresh elections have been held with the constitution of the senate still pending. The last meeting of PU syndicate was held in July last year and the varsity senate had last met in December 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/now-pu-forms-panel-to-consider-employees-grievances-101637785225166.html

In a letter to Nagaland, Sikkim, Maharashtra, Kerala, Goa, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Rajasthan, West Bengal and Ladakh, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan stressed on maintaining high testing rates given the recent increase in travelling due to events like marriages, festivals and vacations that have recently concluded or are underway. “A decrease in testing would undermine the actual infection spread within the community,” Bhushan said in the letter. Also, with the onset of winter and increased pollution in some states, prevalence of ILI/SARI and respiratory distress symptoms should be closely monitored, with tests being conducted regularly for timely monitoring and clustering of cases for early hotspot identification, the official underlined. “In the absence of sustained levels of sufficient testing, it is very difficult to determine the true level of infection spread in a geography. With a majority of countries seeing multiple surges in Covid cases in recent times and a few developed countries facing even fourth and fifth waves despite high levels of Covid vaccination, there is a need for continued vigil given the unpredictable and contagious nature of the disease. “Hence, all efforts must be implemented to preserve the gains made so far and to prevent deterioration of COVID-19 scenario across the country,” the secretary said. All the 13 states and UTs have been given the same advice though each letter mentions state-specific testing details of particular districts and positivity rates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dip-in-covid-testing-rate-in-punjab-j-k-worries-centre-101637785045113.html

The high court bench of justice Jaishree Thakur observed that it is clear that poppy seed has been excluded from the definition of “poppy straw” as the same is used in food and Indian sweets or made into oil, which is largely used for culinary and lighting purposes after it is de-husked. The court was dealing with a plea from one Deepak, who had challenged the May 2019 order of a trial court in which application for release of poppy seeds was dismissed. The 70,950kg of seed was seized in connection with an FIR registered on July 4, 2017, in Sonepat after alleged recovery of poppy husk weighing 2,140kg from a truck, which as per police came out of factory where the seed was later found. The trial court had maintained that there is strong suspicion that the accused were involved in manufacturing poppy husk by bringing raw material in the factory and dismissed the application. In high court, the petitioner had argued they were doing a legal business in the factory in which dalhan, rice, food grain, poppy seeds and oil seeds were processed. The recovery of poppy seeds does not come under the ambit of NDPS Act and the same is not required by the police any more. It was submitted that poppy seeds are perishable in nature and will be spoiled with the passage of time. The court took note of earlier judgments in which it was observed that except for the seed, all other parts of the plant of the species Papaver would fall under the banned “poppy straw” terms. The court while ordering the release said that under these circumstances, the order passed by the trial court cannot be held “good in the eyes of law” and quashed the same. However, the court added that the matter has been decided about ‘superdari’ of poppy seeds and not on merits of the FIR on recovery of poppy husk.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/poppy-seeds-do-not-come-under-ndps-act-ambit-rules-high-court-101637784686320.html

The congested parking has a common entrance and exit, leading to a bottleneck. We have been demanding that the entry and exit be separated, and a vacant plot earmarked as a green belt be converted into a parking lot.

They are sitting right up to the boundary wall of government houses and one can hear their noise till late at night,” he says.Jaswinder Nagpal, president, Shastri Market, says: “The street vendors make it difficult for residents to move around. Sanitation is another issue that worries us.”Kultar Singh, a shopkeeper in Sector 22C, says: “The dustbins in our area are broken and garbage is dumped on footpaths. It is not just an eyesore but also an invitation to diseases.” Mayor Ravi Kant Sharma says he has delivered more than what was promised. “I got a sewer pipeline laid in Sector 22, globe lights were installed in markets, and a direct pipeline was laid to solve the problem of low water pressure on upper floors,” he says, adding: “I have already proposed a multilevel parking near Kiran Cinema, which is under consideration.” Councillor Sunita Dhawan says: “I have got sewerage pipes diverted from the N-choe to get rid of the foul smell besides taking measures to check choking of drains.”Know your ward Localities: Sector 22 and Sector 23 General ward Voters: 18,000 Key issues Parking woes and heavy traffic flow leading to bottlenecks Street vendors leave no space for visitors to move in market areasPoor garbage collection and non-functional streetlights Local voicesThere is just one point for entry and exit to the market, which creates a bottleneck and is a safety hazard.

The adviser fixed their responsibilities and earmarked measures required with regard to different parameters under the nationwide cleanliness survey. All heads of departments have been asked to hold review meetings at their level once a week, while the adviser will review all the matters fortnightly, it was decided. In the recently released report of Swachh Survekshan 2021, Chandigarh’s rank dropped from 8 to 16 among 48 cities with population above 10 lakh. The overall score also dipped from 83% to 71%, leading to the repatriation of medical officer of health Dr Amrit Pal Singh Warring to Punjab for his poor performance.The adviser on Wednesday reviewed the action plan to be implemented for Swachh Survekshan 2022 in a meeting held at the UT Secretariat, Sector 9. Home secretary Nitin Kumar Yadav, finance secretary Vijay Namdeorao Zade, chief conservator of forests Debendra Dalai, MC commissioner Anindita Mitra, deputy commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh and all heads of UT and MC departments were present.Directions issued to all departmentsThe adviser asked the MC commissioner to ensure immediate upgrading of the garbage processing plant so that dry waste could be processed to full capacity.

25-11-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: The magic realism of Paharganj||Two tiny shops, clinging tightly to each other. Atop lies what must had once been a house—now reduced to its skeletal frame. Wild brown grass has claimed the vanished roof’s still existing wooden beams.Such ordinariness on the ground level, such extraordinariness above. Together, they might as well constitute what is known in art as magical realism.The ever-dependable Wikipedia credits magic realism for painting “a realistic view of the modern world while also adding magical elements, often dealing with the blurring of the lines between fantasy and reality.” And this sight in Paharganj’s Main Bazar encapsulates that same merging of fantasy with reality. Even more remarkable is the blasé attitude of the pedestrians who are walking past this exceptional place without giving it a second look. Maybe because the entire mile-long stretch of the market is crammed with such unusual architectural twinning, where the magical is married to the mundane.By the way, the aforementioned first floor with its grass-covered wooden beams also creates a second series of magic realism with an adjacent multi-storey (see photo). Such wondrous scenes recur along the path. Further ahead, for instance, stands a guest house, the kind of boring looking lodges that populate this hotel district. But this glass-and-cement building overcomes its drabness by clinging tightly to a derelict house whose street-facing upper floor wall is distilled into a most melancholic beauty due its old-fashioned wooden doors. But something is not right here. Suddenly the penny drops. This upper storey ideally ought to have a balcony or a window—and not these dreamy blue doors, opening which might lead straight to a sudden fall into the street. A shopkeeper explains that the area was “renovated” during the countdown to the 2010 Delhi Commonwealth Games. A part of the project, he says, included the widening of the Main Bazar road due to which some houses, which were encroaching onto the lane, had to be partially demolished.If that is true, then these doors originally opened into rooms or balconies that no longer exist. Indeed, the market lane is replete with such structures ending abruptly into the air, as if a nose or an eye were missing from someone’s face. In one such scarred house, an elderly woman on the first floor is lounging casually by a door, her legs dangling into the street below, while she enjoys the warmth of the winter sun.Some steps further, yet another plain-looking budget hotel, clinging to a similarly disfigured old building. Their coupling illustrate the union of magic with realism.For decades, Paharganj had been known for its utilitarian inns and its western backpackers. It is time to celebrate its magic realist architecture too.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-magic-realism-of-paharganj-101637783791586.html

The NFHS 2019-21 (NFHS-5) is the fifth in the NFHS series that provides information on population, health, and nutrition for state. Due to the Covid-19 situation and the imposition of lockdown, NFHS-5 fieldwork for Haryana was conducted from January 12, 2020 to March 21, 2020 (prior to the lockdown) and from December 21, 2020 to April 30, 2021 during the post lockdown by Society for Promotion of Youth and Masses (SPYM). The sample size of the information gathered was 18,229 households (21,909 women, and 3,224 men). The maternal and child health indicators such as antenatal checkup, consumption of iron folic acid by pregnant women have improved in comparison to previous survey findings. For example, mothers who had at least four antenatal care visits rose from 45.1 per cent to 60.4 per cent and mothers who consumed iron folic acid for 180 days or more during pregnancy also increased from 14.3 per cent to 32 per cent. The survey found 12 per cent rise in number of obese women (from 21 per cent in 2015-16 to 33.1 per cent now), and the men who are overweight are 28.3 per cent. The percentage of spousal violence (physical or sexual violence) among women (18-49 years) has come down from 32 per cent in 2015-16 to 18.2 per cent. The women (15-24 years) who use hygienic methods of protection during their menstrual period has also improved from earlier 78.3 per cent to 93.2 per cent. About 39 per cent women own a house or land either alone or jointly with others. The quality of family planning services has registered improvement, while there has been a 6 per cent dip in female sterlisation even as male sterlisation was 0.9 per cent against 0.6 per cent five years back.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/national-family-health-survey-shows-improvement-in-haryana-sex-ratio-101637783905291.html
25-11-2021||Chandigarh||Channi govt under fire for appointing SFJ leader’s brother as Genco chief||The Charanjit Singh Channi government has come under fire over the appointment of Balwinder Singh Kotlabama, brother of US-based Avtar Singh Pannun, coordinator of the banned pro-Khalistan organisation Sikhs for Justice (SFJ) as the chairman of Punjab Genco Limited, a subsidiary of Punjab Energy Development Authority (PEDA), with not only the opposition parties, but some Congress leaders questioning the move. Kotlabama is considered close to state cabinet minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa and belongs to his constituency of Fatehgarh Churian. Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal was first to target the Channi-led Congress government over last week’s appointment of Kotlabama. Sukhbir raised objection to the appointment while talking to reporters during a public meeting at Chabbewal and sought an explanation from Channi. While chief minister Channi was not available for comment, Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa said he stood by Kotlabama. “He and his brother Pannun are different and have no connection. Kotlabama is a staunch Congressman. He is my right hand.”Cong’s Sekhri seeks Tript Bajwa’s resignationCongress leaders Fatehjang Singh Bajwa and Ashwani Sekhri also questioned the appointment of Kotlabama, calling it a “serious matter”. Bajwa, the Congress MLA from Qadian, said the National Investigation Agency (NIA) was probing the SFJ and had requested the Canadian government to blacklist those associated with it, including Pannun, for “instigating people against their own country”. Sekhri went a step further and demanded cabinet minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa’s resignation over this issue. “The NIA and other agencies should thoroughly probe this entire matter to bring out the truth,” he said.Cong appeasing anti-national forces: BJPBJP national general secretary Tarun Chugh also slammed the Congress government for appeasing “anti-national” and “disruptive” forces.In a statement, the BJP leader said the appointment of Kotlabama was reprehensible. The Channi government has been buckling under pressure of anti-national forces, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/channi-govt-under-fire-for-appointing-sfj-leader-s-brother-as-genco-chief-101637783545101.html

The AAP had earlier this month announced its first ‘guarantee’ wherein the party promised to provide 20,000 litre of free water to each household every month. During a press conference at AAP’s office on Wednesday, Chandigarh affairs incharge and Delhi MLA Jarnail Singh said, “Chandigarh people will get freedom from piles of garbage.” He said, “The BJP and the Congress, which have been occupying the municipal corporation in rotation for more than two decades, have failed to clean the city.”Singh said residents of the city would be freed from the mountain of garbage lying in the dumping ground if the AAP is voted to power. “World-class arrangements will be made for waste disposal. The Daddu Majra plant will be operated with high-end technology. Apart from this, best arrangements will be made to collect the garbage from every house,” he added. “A unique system will be developed to segregate wet and dry waste. The number of sanitation workers in each ward will be increased. With a ban on throwing garbage in public places, superlative arrangements will be made to avoid littering in the future,” Singh added.Attacking the BJP, he said that the cleanliness ranking of Chandigarh, one of the country’s top cities, has slipped to the 66th position, for which the ruling party is solely responsible.It may be noted here that in the recently released report of Swachh Survekshan 2021, Chandigarh’s rank dropped from eight to 16 among 48 cities with population above 10 lakh.AAP’s co-incharge Pradeep Chhabra said, “The BJP has robbed the city of its beauty by handing over the cleaning task to a private player.” He also questioned the mayor on why the city’s ranking dropped even after spending ₹300 crore in the name of cleanliness in the last five years.

25-11-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Sex ratio at birth plummets to 838, lowest in region||The sex ratio at birth in Chandigarh has dropped to 838 females for every 1,000 males, a significant drop of 14% in the last five years, the data compiled under the National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5) has revealed.When considering the ratio in urban pockets of Chandigarh, the ratio is even worse: 820. In the NFHS-4, which was conducted in 2015-16, the sex ratio at birth was as high as 981 in Chandigarh, highest in the region. Now, the UT is languishing at the bottom. The NFHS-5 (2019-21) conducted by the Union ministry of health and family welfare is the fifth in the series and provides information on population, health, and nutrition for India and each state and UT. In Haryana, which historically had one of the lowest sex ratios in the country, the ratio stands at 893, an improvement from 836 in the previous survey. The national average stands at 929 females per 1000 males. The sex ratio at birth is defined as the number of girls born for every 1,000 boys born, for a given population and over a given period of time.The survey also revealed that the sex ratio of the total population (females per 1,000 males) in Chandigarh’s urban areas is 918, and 868 in rural areas. The cumulative average is 917, still lower than 934 in 2015-16. Also, total fertility rate (children per woman) in Chandigarh has dropped from 1.6% to 1.4%.Due to the Covid-19 situation and the imposition of lockdown, the survey fieldwork for Chandigarh was conducted from January 2020 to March 2020 (prior to the lockdown) and from December 2020 to March 2021 (after lockdown). Information for the survey was gathered from 761 households that included 746 women and 104 men.UT health dept contests dataMeanwhile, the UT health department has questioned the report, while sharing its own data. “As per the health department’s ratio, 934 females are being born for every 1,000 males, which is even better than the national average,” said Dr Suman Singh, director, health services, Chandigarh.Commenting on the possibility of female foeticide being behind the dropping sex ratio, she said: “The UT health department is very vigilant on sex determination tests and no such complaints have been received. The survey also includes migrant population and people might be visiting neighbouring states to get the illegal tests conducted.”Meanwhile, UT health secretary Yashpal Garg said: “The trend of dropping sex ratio in Chandigarh is unusual and the UT’s figures show different data. We will analyse the data and if the central government’s data shows different figures, we will definitely write to the authorities to re-examine the situation.” Improvement in some areasHowever, in some good news, the survey also shows that the facilities for “maternity care and delivery care” have improved in Chandigarh. The percentage of mothers who had an antenatal check-up in the first trimester has increased to 82.3% from 67.4%. Births at institutions or hospitals have increased to 96.9% from 91.6%. Also, 97% of the newborns were attended by skilled health personnel in Chandigarh, against 93.3% in the previous survey.Chandigarh has also improved significantly when it comes to gender-based violence. The recent data shows that 9.7% of presently or previously married women (age 18-49 years) have experienced spousal violence. The figure was as high as 22.5% in 2015-16.Also, no such woman experienced physical violence during pregnancy in Chandigarh, while the figure stood at 3.5% in the last survey.Lifestyle diseases continue to pose risk The National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5) shows growing risk of lifestyle ailments in Chandigarh, including diabetes, hypertension, obesity and diseases associated with smoking and alcohol and drug abuse.As per the survey, around 12% of the females (age 15 and above) have high blood sugar level in Chandigarh while the percentage in men stands at 8.8%. Also, around 16.6% men are dependent on medicines to control the blood sugar while 19% women consume such medicines.Hypertension among adults (15 years or more) was most commonly found in men. As many as 18.7% men have mildly elevated blood pressure while 8.7% have moderately or severely elevated blood pressure. Among women, 14.5% have mild hypertension and 5.6% have moderate to severe problems.If one goes by the NFHS-5 data, 44% Chandigarh women are overweight in the age group of 15-49. Besides, 35% men are overweight with excessive body mass index in the same age group.The use of tobacco and alcohol consumption among adults (age 15 years and above) was found more in men. Around 12% men aged 15 years and above use some kind of tobacco while 18.6% consume alcohol. In comparison, only 0.6% women use tobacco and 0.3% consume alcohol.Dr Sonu Goel, professor, department of community medicine and school of public health, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, said: “In Chandigarh, people have a busy lifestyle. It has drastically changed their eating habits and people now prefer to eat junk, fast or packaged food. This is inviting serious lifestyle issues.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-sex-ratio-at-birth-plummets-to-838-lowest-in-region-101637782285697.html

Also, prices of end products will increase, which will disturb the budget of lower and middle income families.Chairman of the association Ajit Lakra and president Tarun Jain Bawa stated that over 85% products manufactured in the local market have MRP below ₹1,000. “This will certainly increase prices of end products, which is detrimental to the industry. Also, the working capital requirement will increase, as tax has to be paid every month, but payments from customers are realised after 4-5 months of delivery. This may also increase evasion of tax,” they said. Lakra said that they met the Union minister so that the issue can be raised in the Prime Minister’s office. The minister sought suggestions from the industry and assured that the matter will be discussed thoroughly, he added.Earlier, the group of industrialists under the banner of Bhartiya Aarthik Party (BAP), had announced a protest outside the residence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the issue on November 25. Bawa, who is also the president of the party, said that the agitation has been postponed after the minister has assured to take up the matter and resolve the problem being faced by the industry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhianaindustrialists-seek-rollback-of-hike-in-gst-on-textiles-submit-memo-with-union-minister-101637781625177.html

The 4pm air quality index (AQI) reading of the city on Wednesday was 305, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), a rise from Tuesday’s reading of 276.On Wednesday, the AQI value recorded at Teri Gram monitoring station was 277, at Sector 51 was 383, and at Gwal Pahari was 250. The monitoring station at Vikas Sadan was not functional on Wednesday. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.Meanwhile, the India Meteorological Department said that the city’s air quality is likely to deteriorate further and reach the upper end of ‘very poor’ category on Thursday. “For the next two days, the air quality is likely to remain in the very poor category. Gradual improvement is likely from November 27, with PM2.5 to be the predominant pollutant,” the IMD said in a statement on Wednesday. According to IMD, Gurugram on Wednesday recorded the minimum temperature at 9.4°C against 10.8°C a day earlier, a dip of 1.4°C. The city recorded the maximum temperature at 26°C on Wednesday. Sachin Panwar, a city-based air quality expert, said that in the coming days, the air quality will be ‘severe’ in the morning and evening, but during the afternoon it will turn ‘very poor’ as rise in temperature during the day would help in dispersal of pollutants. “The wind speed is around 2 to 4kmph and the temperature is also dipping, which will give rise to pollution,” he said. He also said that things will complicate further when fog envelops the city by the start of December and gets mixed with pollutants. “The smog is even more problematic as it hovers over the city for the entire day, making breathing difficult,” said Panwar. The Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) also predicted that air quality was likely to deteriorate further for the next few days, and asked the district administration to strictly implement the Grap measures and also the directions issued by the Commission of Air Quality Management (CAQM) on Wednesday. As per the CAQM directions, the Haryana government has been asked to take steps to control industrial pollution and carry out intensive drives by senior officers and take suitable penal actions on priority. It also asked the government to ensure that older petrol and diesel vehicles without pollution certificate are not allowed to ply on roads. “We are following CAQM orders at present. All construction sites are being monitored and we are penalising them in case they are violating any norms. We are checking if they sprinkle water around their sites to mitigate air pollution. All civic agencies are carrying out their respective role in controlling dust pollution in the district,” said Kuldeep Singh, regional officer, HSPCB.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gurugam-air-quality-again-moves-to-very-poor-as-wind-speed-slows-down-101637781454114.html

He claimed that Gupta levelled “defamatory, scandalous, mischievous, false and scurrilous allegations” verbally as well as in writing.Gahlot also claimed that Gupta made unabated tweets doubting the integrity of the minister in relation to the purchase of the low-floor buses, despite a clean chit being given by a high-powered committee. He said the Delhi government floated a tender for buses and after due process, it was awarded to Tata; but all sorts of allegations were made. The trial court said there was prima facie evidence to summon Gupta as an accused for the alleged offence of defamation.Senior lawyer Ajay Burman, appearing for Gupta, argued that his client was “squarely covered” under the exceptions to defamation, as stated under the Indian Penal Code, as the statements were made in discharge of public service as a leader of the opposition.He also alleged that a criminal defamation complaint was not maintainable before a magisterial court while contending that another single judge of the high court had earlier refused to grant any ex parte interim relief to the minister on his suit against the allegedly defamatory tweets.Senior advocate Manish Vashisht, appearing for Gahlot, said Gupta’s tweets were “absolutely scandalous” and made in the absence of any “conclusive finding by any judicial body”.“You are doing dharna outside my house. You are defaming me in front of my family,” Vashisht said, while speaking for his client. The matter will be next heard on March 4, 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hc-stays-trial-court-order-to-summon-bjp-mla-vijender-gupta-in-criminal-defamation-case-101637780724939.html

He said it was not less than an assault on the justice delivery system whereby institutional integrity of the Delhi judiciary was sought to be undermined.The hearing relates to tampering with evidence in the main case on the fire tragedy, which claimed 59 lives, during the screening of the Hindi film ‘Border’ on June 13, 1997. In August 2015, the Ansal brothers were sentenced to two years in jail in the main fire case by the Supreme Court, but the apex court released them taking into account the time they already spent in jail, on the condition that they pay a fine of ₹30 crore each, to be used for building a trauma centre in the national capitalA Delhi court on November 8, also handed a seven-year jail term each to the brothers for tampering with evidence and noted in the verdict that their regrets over the incident were “hollow”.Challenging the latest magisterial court conviction and jail term, Ansals have also urged the court to suspend their punishment during the pendency of the appeal.The magisterial court also awarded seven years in jail to former court staff Dinesh Chand Sharma and two others, P P Batra and Anoop Singh, and imposed a fine of ₹3 lakh on each of them.The tampering was detected for the first time on July 20, 2002, and a departmental inquiry was initiated against Sharma and he was suspended. He was terminated from service on June 25, 2004. The prosecution said after the termination, the Ansal brothers helped Sharma get employment on a monthly salary of ₹15,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/suspension-of-jail-term-to-ansals-will-cause-trauma-to-uphaar-victims-police-101637780606547.html
25-11-2021||Kolkata||Uncertainty looms over civic polls in Kolkata and Howrah to be held next month||The Calcutta High Court, which was scheduled to hear the petition on holding simultaneous elections to all civic bodies in West Bengal on Wednesday, will take up the matter on November 29, even as uncertainty looms over the civic polls in Kolkata and Howrah to be held on December 19, a date initially proposed by the Mamata Banerjee-led administration. Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Wednesday sent back the Howrah Municipal Corporation (Amendment) Bill, 2021 seeking more details from the government. “As regards Howrah Municipal Corporation (Amendment) Bill, 2021 @MamataOfficial WB Governor Shri Jagdeep Dhankhar has sought further details for consideration of the same under Article 200 of the Constitution,” Dhankhar tweeted. The amendment bill aims to carve out Bally Municipality in Howrah district from the jurisdiction of the Howrah Municipal Corporation. Experts said that even though the Trinamool Congress (TMC)-ruled state government wanted to hold the civic polls in phases, starting with Kolkata and Howrah on December 19, the plan now seems uncertain. The state is considering holding the election only in the Kolkata Municipal Corporation on December 19 “The court had said that elections should be held at the earliest. We are concerned with the delay. At present the daily count of Covid-19 cases have declined. Elections should be held at the earliest. The BJP knows that if elections are held, they will lose and hence has adopted delaying tactics,” said Firhad Hakim, state minister and senior TMC leader. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), however, had moved the high court demanding simultaneous elections to all civic bodies. “There has to be a minimum gap of 24 days between the date of notification and holding polls. In that case if elections are to be held on December 19, the notification would have to be published on Thursday. We are taking legal opinion,” said a senior state government official. Elections to 114 civic bodies are pending for more than a year. The TMC controls most of the civic bodies in West Bengal. The terms of the elected boards ended over two years ago, but polls were not held because of the Covid-19 pandemic. “The state government has to first notify. Once the state government comes up with the notification, we will also notify announcing the dates of the polls,” said a senior official of the state election commission. The SEC had submitted an affidavit before the court earlier this week stating that it wants to hold elections to the municipal corporations of Kolkata and Howrah first as the number of double vaccinated people in these two cities is high. It said elections to the other municipal bodies in the state would be held in phases later. “The BJP has moved the court with very obvious questions.

25-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi HC seeks authorities’ stand on opening of liquor shop in residential area||The Delhi high court on Wednesday sought the stand of the Delhi government, excise commissioner and the East Delhi Municipal Corporation regarding a plea by two residents challenging the opening of a liquor shop in their locality near Karkardooma court.A bench comprising chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh issued a notice based on the PIL by the residents of east Delhi’s Chander Nagar area who claimed that the shop will be in close vicinity to a school, temple and a government dispensary.The petitioners claimed that ever since residents of the locality came to know about the opening of a liquor shop in the area, they were “scared” about their children’s future, “modesty of ladies, young girls and teenagers’’, the law and order situation, as well as the welfare of the locality.They argued that the opening of the liquor shop violates the Delhi Excise Act and Rules as it falls under is “restricted area as per the settled law”.The petition, filed through advocate Kamal Mehta, claimed that the proposed shop is only 30 metres from the EDMC primary school, 60 metres from two temples, and 50 metres from a government dispensary. It also said that the shop is located within 100 metres of a colony of labourers, chemists, and a general store.“As per norms of the government of Delhi, a liquor shop cannot function within 50-100 metres of a school, temple, etc. Any permission beyond the permissible limit envisages appropriate action against the officials,” the petition has stated.Seeking direction to the authorities to stop the opening of the liquor shop, the petitioners contended that its continuation will create nuisance in the locality.The court was also informed that there is no ample parking space near the shop premises, which is likely to result in traffic as people would park their vehicle on the road.The matter will be heard next on January 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hc-seeks-authorities-stand-on-opening-of-liquor-shop-in-residential-area-101637780484834.html
25-11-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram: MCG seeks action against 7 officials for paying contractor twice||Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja has written to the directorate of urban local bodies (ULB), seeking permission to register a police case against seven officials of the civic body for allegedly paying a contractor twice for the same work. Ahuja has also sought permission for a similar action against the contractor who was hired for laying a sewerage line, constructing manholes, and reconstructing roads in Sheetla Mata Road and Palam Vihar areas in November 2018. After the project was completed in February 2019, ₹47 lakh was paid to the contractor. In November 2019, however, another payment of ₹44 lakh was allegedly made to the contractor by the MCG for the same project, he said.“The seven officials failed to discharge their duties diligently and the transaction inflicted a financial loss to the MCG and gave financial gain to a third party. This is a gross violation of Haryana Civil Services (Employees Conduct Rules), 2016. The seven MCG officials and contractor in connivance of malafide intention have committed a criminal conspiracy,” said Ahuja.The matter first came to the fore in July this year, when the contractor “apprised” the MCG of being paid twice for the same project and returned ₹44 lakh to the civic body. Around the time, a special audit of all financial transactions in the MCG was being carried out by a team of the Principal Accountant General (Audit) Haryana.The matter prompted a vigilance wing inquiry, and in September the civic body issued a show-cause notice to the officials concerned and the contractor, seeking an explanation on the matter. In the vigilance wing inquiry, seven MCG officials — an executive engineer, two accountants, an assistant engineer, one former junior engineer, a former chief account officer, and a former section officer — were allegedly found guilty of making an illegal and fraudulent payment to the private contractor.Following the submission of the vigilance wing report, on November 3, Ahuja wrote to directorate of ULB for allowing the MCG to register an FIR against the seven officials.Ahuja said that besides disciplinary action, the matter needs proper police investigation following the registering of an FIR and hence, has sought permission from the ULB.SK Sharma, a local activist, had filed a right to information (RTI) application on the matter and made its reply public on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-mcg-seeks-action-against-7-officials-for-paying-contractor-twice-101637780366307.html
25-11-2021||Delhi||Low temp, poor wind speed push Delhi’s air quality back in ‘very poor’ zone||A combination of low temperature and poor wind speed pushed Delhi’s air quality back into the ‘very poor’ category on Wednesday, a day after being recorded in the poor zone -- the best since November 1, scientists said. The national Capital recorded its coldest day of the season on Wednesday with the minimum temperature being recorded at 9.2 degrees Celsius, and the wind speed stayed in the range of 5-10km/hr, according to IMD data. The 4pm average air quality index in Delhi was recorded at 361 on Wednesday, compared to 290 on Tuesday even as the forecasting agencies said that similar meteorological conditions over the next two days may keep the air in the very poor zone. They said wind speed is expected to pick up November 27 onwards that will help disperse pollutants and improve air quality. Gufran Beig, founder and project director at the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (Safar), said wind speed is expected to remain below 5 km/hr for the next two days. “We are experiencing calm wind conditions, and from Thursday, it may further drop to 3-4 km/hr. This will lead to pollutants accumulating over Delhi and air quality will go up to the higher end of the ‘very poor’ category (AQI value 300-400).” According to Safar, the contribution of farm fires to Delhi’s PM 2.5 levels on Wednesday was just 2% , with 432 incidences of stubble burning recorded in the northern plains. According to the Safar bulletin, local weather will now play a key role in determining air quality. “With the onset of winter, local weather is likely to be dominating factor in determining air quality,” the bulletin said. IMD scientist RK Jenamani said though wind speeds on Wednesday were recorded in the range of 5-10 km/hr, it was calmer in the early hours of the day. “At night, and in the morning, wind speed will be calm over the next two days,” he said. The Early Warning System (EWS) for Delhi, another forecasting mechanism under the ministry of earth sciences, said shallow fog will start occurring over Delhi in the morning hours. “The predominant surface wind is likely to be coming from southeast/southwest direction, with wind speeds ranging between 5-8 km/hr. They will remain calm during evening and night, with shallow fog occurring in the morning on both Thursday and Friday,” it said. Dipankar Saha, former head at the Central Pollution Control Board’s air laboratory, said while stubble burning impacts Delhi’s air largely between October 15 and November 15, December and January generally see a deterioration in air quality due to meteorological factors such as low temperature, fog and low wind speed. “Wind, along with low temperatures, will play a key role now. We may also start seeing the impact of fog in the morning hours,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/low-temp-poor-wind-speed-push-delhi-s-air-quality-back-in-very-poor-zone-101637780364965.html

He said the Delhi Police has taken a series of steps such as the linking of PCR vans with police stations, separation of law and order and investigation duties, filling up of all vacant posts and better management of citizen services for making people feel safer, and at the same time control crime.Earlier, PCR vans used to act only as the first responders, and after reaching the spot they would inform the local police station about the case. Now, the PCR staff has also been assigned investigation duties besides responding to distress calls. “This has brought average response time from eight minutes to three minutes,” Asthana said while addressing a session organised by the Indian Women’s Press Corps.He added that controlling crime against children and women is a priority for the Delhi Police. The commissioner said currently the number of women officers posted in active policing positions is the highest ever. He added that currently six deputy commissioners, eight additional deputy commissioners, eight assistant commissioners and nine station house officers are women.“There is a separate crime against women cell in each district, besides the Special Police Unit for Women & Children (SPUWAC), to deal with complaints related to crime against women. Immediate attention is given if any call regarding a woman in distress is received. These cells and the unit also counsels the victim and handle issues such as matrimonial discord. Crimes against women are registered and investigated promptly,” Asthana said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/preventing-crime-against-women-is-delhi-police-s-priority-asthana-101637780306950.html
25-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi HC asks authorities to recruit doctors, paramedics in govt hospitals||The Delhi high court on Wednesday asked the Centre and state government to start the recruitment process for the appointment of doctors and paramedical staff in government-run hospitals here.A bench comprising chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh, while hearing a plea by a social worker claiming an acute shortage of doctors and paramedical staff in government-run hospitals in the Capital, asked the authorities to “show some speed” in the recruitment process.“You (authorities) start the recruitment process and appoint them. Show some speed. This is required.”“It is not necessary that all vacancies should be filled (if) you are not getting suitable candidates. Start the process. You can’t say that you will never start the process,” the bench said.The court issued a notice based on a public interest litigation filed by Dr Nand Kishore Garg — a social activist and former Delhi MLA — and sought a response from the All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS), Safdarjung Hospital, and Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital.Garg’s plea sought the immediate filling up of vacancies in government-run hospitals.The petitioner, represented by lawyer Shashank Deo Sudhi, claimed that there is an acute shortage of doctors and paramedical staff in government-run hospitals in the city, which is resulting in poor patients being forced to approach private hospitals and pay huge amounts of money.“As per RTI replies dated February 7, 2020, 1,838 doctors have been working in the health and welfare department of Delhi while 745 posts of doctors were lying vacant, and, as per the RTI reply dated November 2, 2021, in government hospitals, such as Guru Tegh Bahadur Hospital, the sanctioned strength of paramedical officials is 475, out of which 135 posts are vacant,” the petition stated.“(RTI) discloses over 800 vacancies of doctors in different categories are lying vacant in AIIMS alone, while in another hospital of the Central government, namely Safdarjung, [there is a shortage of 433 doctors and 67 paramedical staff. Further, another hospital, namely Ram Manohar Lohia, there is vacancy of more than 100 doctors and paramedical staff,” it added.The petition has submitted that inadequate infrastructure in the government hospitals is “becoming ominous” because of serious diseases like Covid-19 and other communicable life-threatening ailments.The matter will be heard next on January 12.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hc-asks-authorities-to-recruit-doctors-paramedics-in-govt-hospitals-101637780124871.html
25-11-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram: 5-acre land near Golf Course Road cleared of encroachment||Continuing its drive against encroachment of government land, the Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) on Wednesday demolished over 700 hutments constructed illegally over five acres of land owned by the authority in Nathupur near Golf Course Road, officials said. HSVP officials said that the demolition drive started amid resistance by occupants of hutments, but a police team, which accompanied the enforcement team, brought the situation under control. On Tuesday, the enforcement team of HSVP demolished over 1,500 temporary shops and hutments constructed illegally on three acres in the same area. Sandeep Lot, junior engineer, HSVP, said that the enforcement team started the drive around 12.30pm and immediately met with resistance from the residents. “It was only after a warning by the police team that the residents of hutments as well as local villagers moved away from the encroached land. Three-acre land is still under encroachment and it will be cleared on Thursday,” he said. The officials said that eight acres of land, which was acquired by the authority in 2009, have been cleared of encroachment over two days. “Majority of the people living in these hutments work as ragpickers. Around two-acre land, which was cleared of encroachment on Wednesday, was being used as a segregation point, as a result of which the entire area looked like a waste dumping station. This practice will be stopped now,” said another HSVP official, who preferred anonymity. The authority has around 70 acres of encroached land in the jurisdiction of estate office two, which it plans to get cleared in the next six months, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-5-acre-land-near-golf-course-road-cleared-of-encroachment-101637780064903.html
25-11-2021||Delhi||Over 1200 trees in Vasant Vihar deconcretised after Delhi HC directions||Acting on the order by the Delhi high court, the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) removed concrete from around nearly 1,200 trees in Vasant Vihar, senior civic body officials said on Wednesday. “Every day, we are removing cemented floors that have come up around trees in the area. Till now, we have already covered A to F blocks. We have been ordered by the court to remove maximum concrete from around trees by November 26, which is the next date of hearing,” said a senior SDMC official, asking not to be named. HT reported in December last year that of the total 4,993 trees on the streets of Vasant Vihar, 3,859 were heavily concretised. A tree census conducted by local residents showed over 450 trees had nails, tree guards, barbed wires etc. in or around them, 764 trees were lopped off and at least 793 trees were infested with termites. Based on HT’s report a complaint was filed with the Delhi forest department by environmental activists, and a petition was also filed at the Delhi high court. The report has also been quoted in the petition. Senior SDMC officials on Wednesday said that since the ban on construction and demolition was lifted by the Delhi government on November 22, the department has deconcretised nearly 1,200 trees in the neighbourhood. They cemented pavements, parking spaces have come up around most trees. During a spot check at Vasant Vihar F-block on Wednesday, civic officials told HT that they were facing abuses and threats by local residents who allegedly encroached upon public land, and placed concrete around trees on the streets. “For the last few days many residents have come and threatened to file cases against us, some have also screamed and hurled abuses at us. We have now called the police force for the protection of our staff,” said an SDMC official who led the deconcretisation drive on Wednesday. Apart from removing the concrete with machines, the corporation was also allowing residents and officials from embassies that are located in the area to clear the area around trees themselves.“Some embassies and residents requested that they be allowed to remove the concrete around the trees on their driveways. We have marked the area, and given them two days to clear it,” the official said. An elderly resident of the area, who asked not to be named, was seen measuring the area around the trees that were deconcretised by the SDMC officials. She alleged that the civic body teams “damaged” driveways and were removing cement beyond the one-metre radius around the trees as prescribed by the courts. In 2013, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) did not just ban concretisation of the base of trees within a radius of one metre, but also asked the authorities not to dig the road within one metre of a tree. “The court has said that the area within a radius of one metre around the trees cannot be concretised, but they (civic body) are damaging the entire area mindlessly. There is a sewer line below the driveway that can be damaged. Plus, after breaking the cement slabs with heavy machines, they are making labourers remove the debris. They are digging the roots of trees. This will kill the tree anyway,” she said. Vallari Sheel, an environmental scientist and urban ecologist, who also spearheaded the trees census in Vasant Vihar, said the primary aim of the census was to understand the health of street trees in the locality and to get the agencies rectify the problems. “It is good that action is being taken. This was the primary aim behind conducting the census. Tree census is important to create awareness among residents, but it also helps create a database for agencies and help them take action against violations, just like it is being done now. With the action being taken here, Vasant Vihar can become a model colony. Tree census should be conducted across the Capital and based on its findings, agencies should take action,” Sheel said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/over-1200-trees-in-vasant-vihar-deconcretised-after-delhi-hc-directions-101637779946108.html

25-11-2021||Delhi||Court directs FIR against BJP spokesman for posting doctored video of Kejriwal||A Delhi court on Tuesday said a “doctored video” of Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal purportedly supporting the Centres three farm laws, allegedly posted by Bharatiya Janata Party spokesperson Sambit Patra, could have ended up outraging protesting farmers and could have resulted in a rioting like situation across the nation. Metropolitan magistrate Rishabh Kapoor directed the police to register an FIR against Patra for the alleged offence, after a complaint was filed by Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA Atishi stating that the fabricated video was published on social media by Patra with the intent to provoke farmers, who repose strong faith in Kejriwal, to rise against the CM.In the order copy released on Wednesday, the court said the forensics report clearly reflects that the impugned video was “edited” or “altered”.It said even the action taken report (ATR) filed by the police clearly states that the video clip in question was within the category of “manipulated media”, as marked by microblogging website Twitter.Kapoor said the video was “manipulated” in such a way to give it a colour that Kejriwal was endorsing the farm laws.The court said the doctored video was circulated on social media with the intent to make the protesting farmers believe that Kejriwal was supporting the farm laws, and it could have outraged them.“The fact that the impugned video was published on the Twitter handle of proposed accused, with the caption “teeno farm bills ke laabh ginate hue... Sir jee”, prima facie proves that same was circulated on Twitter with no other intention but to cause the protesting farmers to believe that Kejriwal is supporting the farm laws, which may have perpetuated a state of outrage with the protesting farmers and may have resulted in rioting like situation across the nation,” the court said in an eight page order.“In the impugned video clip running in 18 seconds, it can be clearly seen that the above stances quoted by Kejriwal in the original video, were placed and doctored in such a way to give them a colour as if he was speaking in support of farm laws,” it further said.Kapoor noted that in the original video, which is 40 minutes 52 seconds long clip, Kejriwal was replying to the question of a journalist, by quoting the speeches given by leaders of BJP in support of farm laws.The court further said at the end of each sentence, Kejriwal was saying that the above quoted benefits of the farm laws were already in existence even prior to the promulgation of the three new laws.The judge said the police have not probed the circumstances under which the proposed accused (Patra) has published the said video clip on his Twitter handle.“Besides, the police have also not conducted any probe to find out whether the impugned video clip was already available in public domain by associating Twitter with the inquiry, so as to rule out the fabrication/ alteration of the same at the behest of proposed accused,” the court said.The matter will next be heard on February 3, 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hc-directs-fir-against-bjp-spokesman-for-posting-doctored-video-of-kejriwal-101637779767283.html
25-11-2021||Noida||Mumbai gangster Abu Salem’s accomplice arrested in Noida||The Gautam Buddh Nagar police and Uttar Pradesh special task force on Tuesday evening arrested a close associate of Mumbai gangster Abu Salem from Noida’s Sector 20. The suspect, identified as Harish Khan (30), was on the run ever since an attempt to murder case was lodged against him at Noida’s Sector 20 police station in 2014. Gautam Budh Nagar police also announced a reward of ₹25,000 for his arrest. Harish, a resident of Paidhuni in Mumbai, originally belongs to Jaunpur in Uttar Pradesh, said police. “Harish used to go to meet his friend Osama, who was behind bars at the Arthur Road jail in 2006. He met Abu Salem and Zafar Supari here as they were lodged in the same jail. Soon, Harish became a member of Zafar Supari’s brother Khan Mubarak’s gang, which was involved in investing Abu Salem’s funds in real estate,” said Raj Kumar Mishra, additional superintendent, special task force . Zafar Supari and Khan Mubarak are also known gangsters from Uttar Pradesh’s Ambedkarnagar district, said police.In 2014, Harish and another accomplice of Abu Salem, Gajender Singh, came to Gautam Budh Nagar. They would take the names of mafias to extort money from people on the pretext of property dealing.Mishra said Singh and Harish allegedly duped a Delhi-based businessman of ₹1.8 crore in 2014. When asked to return the money, Singh allegedly used his connections to threaten the businessman and even shot at him in Noida’s Sector 18. Both Singh and Harish were booked under Sections 307 (attempt to murder), 427 (Mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees), 120 B (party to a criminal conspiracy), 34 (Acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the IPC. “Singh was arrested last year in Noida while Harish was still on the run. On interrogating Singh, we learnt that Harish will be in Noida on November 23. A join operation was carried out along, with the Gautam Budh Nagar police, around 8.30pm on Tuesday and Harish was arrested nabbed from Labour Chowk in Sector 20,” said Mishra. Police recovered a pistol, live cartridges and identification documents from the Harish. He has also been booked under relevant sections of the Arms Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/mumbai-gangster-abu-salem-s-accomplice-arrested-in-noida-101637779704817.html

The MCG’s plan includes relaying of the 1.1-km stretch with ready mixed concrete, widening the two-lane carriageway with an extra lane on each side, installing a traffic signal at the Chauma Road/ Dhanwapur Road intersection, placing jersey barriers to divert traffic, and painting zebra crossings for facilitating movement of pedestrians and cyclists, officials said on Wednesday. The stretch is heavily congested and its upgrade will help residents of sectors 3, 9, 103, 107, and 108. The civic body has floated a ₹1.71 crore tender for the project, bids of which will be opened on December 6, the officials said.“Once a contractor is finalised, we will initiate the work in the next two-three weeks. We are aiming to start the work on the project by the end of December. The contractor will have to maintain the stretch for two years from the date the project is completed,” said Satpal Singh, executive engineer of MCG who is overseeing the project. The MCG had planned a similar project in December 2017, however, due to technical reasons it never took off. In July, the MCG had floated the same tender. However, due to a lack of bidders, it has been refloated again.“We want to widen the existing carriageway on each side by an extra lane as well as the service lanes of the flyover to facilitate traffic movement. For further streamlining, we will be placing a traffic signal at the intersection for proper dispersal of traffic,” said a former MCG official who was earlier overseeing the project.Yashesh Yadav, president of Dwarka Expressway Welfare Association, which represents several residential projects on the expressway, said that currently, the stretch is pothole-ridden and uneven. During peak hours it takes commuters 15-20 minutes to cross the stretch, he said. “The road is in a bad condition. Once upgraded, it will not only provide relief to thousands of residents living in sectors 3, 9, 103, 107, and 108, but also hundreds of commuters coming from Chhawla in Delhi who work in various parts of Old Gurgaon,” said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gurugram-daulatabad-main-road-to-be-upgraded-to-ease-congestion-101637779590297.html

In a joint press conference on Wednesday, North MCD mayor Raja Iqbal Singh and standing committee chairman Jogi Ram Jain said that an FIR will be filed by the corporation against AAP members for allegedly slapping BJP standing committee member Vijender Yadav. The mayor said that a delegation of senior civic body functionaries will meet lieutenant governor (LG) Anil Baijal to demand action against AAP MLA Mohinder Goyal. Jain said, “When we tried to discuss the issue of air pollution and new liquor vends during the house meeting, and our councillor Vijender Yadav tried to stage a symbolic protest by displaying a mix of tea and water to show liquor, the AAP MLA (Goyal) attacked the BJP councillor. We have decided to file a police complaint,” he added. A municipal official explained that the AAP MLA was a nominated member of the House, and was legally allowed to attend the sitting. The mayor said such behaviour in the House was “unprecedented”. “The House was all set to discuss increasing levels of pollution in the city, and the new excise policy of the Delhi government when AAP MLA Mohinder Goyal slapped BJP councillor Vijender Yadav. This undemocratic behaviour by the AAP MLA has tarnished the dignity of the House. We strongly condemn his behaviour and urge Delhi chief minister to take strong action against the MLA. We will raise the issue before the LG, and will also register an FIR,” Singh said.Leader of the opposition in North MCD, Vikas Goyal said the BJP councillor brought a “liquor bottle” in the house that hurt the dignity of the House. “The (BJP) councillors were abusing the opposition. Our MLA Mohinder Goyal slapped him. I don’t agree with the act but you should also consider that the councillor was being very provocative and anyone could have lost cool over it. I am not even favour of slapping anyone. The mayor can file an FIR but why don’t they make the video recording of House proceedings public?” Goyal asked. Despite repeated attempts, Mohinder Goyal, AAP MLA from Rithala, did not respond HTs queries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/north-mcd-to-file-fir-against-aap-for-physical-altercation-during-house-meeting-101637779588657.html

The work on the plant is expected to commence next year. The villagers of Galand and neighbouring villages have been protesting against the construction of the plant in their area and demanding that it be set up elsewhere. However, the 44.26 acres, where the site is to come up, belongs to the corporation and two days ago, it started the construction of the boundary wall to secure the site. “About 250 people demolished the boundary wall on Wednesday morning and also misbehaved with officials. The entire length of the wall is about 2,300 metres and the per metre cost is about ₹2,000. So, the cost involved will be realised from the erring persons and we are in touch with officials in Hapur. An FIR will also be registered in this connection,” said MS Tanwar, municipal commissioner. The villagers of Galand have been staging a sit-in protest for past two months near the site and said the plant will lead to unhygienic conditions in their villages and also pose a health hazard. “On Wednesday morning, hundreds of agitated locals arrived and demolished the boundary wall which is getting constructed by the corporation. People are agitated over the developments leading to construction of the plant. Our protest will continue and our sit-in will also continue till the time officials decide to shift the plant to another location,” said Sanjay Khori, gram pradhan (village head) of Galand. “We know that officials will lodge FIRs in this connection but we will continue with the protest for our demand to shift the plant to some other site,” he added. The plant is expected to process about 2,500 metric tonnes of daily solid waste and generate electricity that will be transferred to the electricity department. At present, the Ghaziabad city has no landfill site available for processing daily solid waste of about 1,200 metric tonnes. The officials of the corporation have already admitted that about 700 metric tonnes of daily solid waste fail to get processed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/mob-demolishes-boundary-wall-of-waste-to-energy-plant-in-galand-101637779587543.html
25-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Two arrested for smuggling guns in milk canisters||For the last six months, two men, who posed as milkmen and sold illegal guns by hiding it in milk canisters were arrested from Jaffarpur, Delhi police said on Wednesday. Police said the two alleged gun smugglers Kuldeep(40) and Dilbagh(30) alias Bage are residents of Palwal and Gurugram in Haryana. Police are tracing the source of the weapons and the criminals, who bought it. Preliminary investigation has revealed that two men have until now supplied at least 100 pistols to such criminals. “ We had received a tip off about interstate arms smugglers who were selling fire arms to criminals and gangsters in Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. The two had posed as milkmen, had attached milk canisters on their bike and had come to sell the weapons. Even the bike they were using turned out to be a stolen one. It was stolen from Nuh, Mewat,” said Shankar Chaudhary, deputy commissioner of police(Dwarka). The officer said that police recovered 10 country-made pistols from the milk canister and are now on the lookout for a man named Bharat, who had engaged the two men.Police said that they had analyzed a number of shooting incidents in the Dwarka area and found that pistols used in these cases were smuggled from Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. “A separate team was tasked to collect intelligence on the source of the weapons. The team found that two men Kuldeep and Dilbagh were actively smuggling the firearm. We then studied their modus operandi and kept close watch on the activities of the gang,” said Chaudhary.Police said the two men were arrested from Jaffarpur’s Rawta Mor on November 22 after the police team laid a trap. A man named Bharat, resident of Jewar in Uttar Pradesh had directed them to smuggle the weapons.In cases of weapons seized from city criminals, Delhi police have in these years pinned the source of country made pistols to illegal factories in places such as Meerut, Muzaffarnagar, Aligarh, Agra, Mathura, Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh. Police have also found that pistols were smuggled into Delhi from factories of Dhar, Khargone, Burhanpur, Indore, Gwalior and Sendwa in Madhya Pradesh, and also Khagariya and Munger in Bihar. At least 2000 illegal country made pistols are seized every year in Delhi. In the last few months, police have launched a crackdown on smuggling of illegal fire arms to stop gang wars in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-two-arrested-for-smuggling-guns-in-milk-canisters-101637779524922.html
25-11-2021||Noida||Air in Noida, Ghaziabad back to ‘very poor’ zone as wind speed drops||The ‘poor’ but significantly better air prevailing over Delhi-NCR a day ago was short-lived as low wind speed on Wednesday aggravated the pollution levels, pushing the air quality of the region to the ‘very poor’ category. According to the air quality index (AQI) bulletin released by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) on Wednesday, the AQI in Ghaziabad, Greater Noida and Noida was 366, 312 and 325 compared to AQI readings of 268, 255 and 252 a day earlier. Officials of the UP Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) said the deterioration in the air quality is due to the low wind speed. “The winds blowing in the past two days were sufficient to disperse pollutants. The wind speed dropped considerably on Wednesday. As a result, pollutants have again got trapped in the region and are not getting dispersed,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB. “Our teams are tracking the local pollution sources in different areas and also in the hotspots. The deterioration in air quality is temporary and will improve once the wind picks up speed,” he said. Experts from the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) said wind speed was considerably low on Wednesday. “Currently, wind is moving at a speed of 5-10kmph. This was about 15-25kmph on Monday,” said R K Jenamani, senior scientist at the IMD. Meanwhile, the forecast by the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) said on Wednesday that the local surface winds will remain relatively low for the next three days that will reduce the dispersion of pollution and lead to deterioration of air quality. “But air quality is likely to be within ‘very poor’ category for the next two days. On November 27, local surface winds are likely to increase, resulting in improvement of air quality but expected to be within ‘very poor’ category,” said the forecast.  With the onset of winter, local weather conditions are likely to determine the air quality, added the forecast.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/air-in-noida-ghaziabad-back-to-very-poor-zone-as-wind-speed-drops-101637779346022.html
25-11-2021||Lucknow||National Family Health Survey-5: Improvement in UP, say major indicators||LUCKNOW: Only 1.5% women aged between 30 and 49 years in Uttar Pradesh have ever undergone a screening test for cervical cancer in life, as per the findings of the National Family Health Survery-5 (NFHS-5). The findings that were released on Wednesday said many health indicators had improved in the state. Less domestic violence with women was reported in the family survey while the sex ratio also improved. In urban areas, 1.1% and in rural areas 1.7% women respondents said they underwent screening, revealing rural women scored better when it came to awareness and screening for cervical cancer. The number of women between the age of 30 and 49 years, who had ever undergone a breast examination for cancer, was poor at 0.4%, both in rural and urban areas surveyed. Doctors said women still needed to prioritise their health, particularly towards ailments such as cervical and breast cancer. “Women often feel shy to discuss their health issues. Whether it is body pain or a lump in the breast, they refrain fromvisiting doctors unless unbearable. Women need to pay more attention towards their health to ensure they make use of the health facilities that have improved in the state,” said Dr Amita Shukla, senior gynaecologist, SC Trivedi Memorial Trust Hospital. Similarly, the number of women who had ever undergone an oral cavity examination for cancer was just 0.6% both in urban and rural areas. When the same question was put to men, 1.1% of them said they had. Among urban men the ratio was 1.0% and among rural men it was 1.2%. The National Family Health Survey 2020-21 (NFHS-5), the fifth in the NFHS series, provides information on population, health and nutrition for India and each state/union territory (UT). It also provides district-level estimates for many important indicators. The indicators say use of family planning methods and institutional delivery went up and diarrhoea infection among kids went down. The data said breastfeeding till the age of six months went up from 41.6% to 59.7% in five years and overall vaccination graph went up from 51.1% to 69.6%. “People in the state are more aware now regarding child health. Myths have been eliminated, hence programme implementation has become smooth and the credit goes to field staff also,” said Dr ved Prakash, GM, Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram. Violence among spouses Less domestic violence with women was reported in the family survey. In all, 34.8% married women aged between 18 and 49 years said they had experienced spousal violence. This figure in the same age group in NFHS-4 was 36.8%. IN urban areas the ratio was 32.7% and rural areas 35.5% according to NFHS-5. When married women aged between 18 and 49 years were asked if they had experienced physical violence during any pregnancy, 3.7% responded in the affirmative as compared to 4.3% during NFHS-4. When young women aged between 18 and 29 years were asked if they experienced sexual violence by age 18, in all 0.7% said yes as compared to 1.1% in NFHS-4. Sex ratio shows improvement in Uttar Pradesh The sex ratio has also shown improvement in the state. The sex ratio of the total population (females per 1,000 males) has reached 1017 in the NFHS-5 against 995 that was reported in the NFHS 4, conducted between 2015 and 2016. According to the data, urban sex ratio is 1036, better than rural which is 961. The sex ratio at birth has also improved in NFHS 5, as the data shows 941 females per 1000 males against 903 in NFHS 4.

25-11-2021||Delhi||SOP released for newly formed cyber police stations in Delhi||Ahead of December 1, when the 15 newly created cyber cell police stations in each of the 15 police districts will start their operations, Delhi Police has issued a detailed standard operating procedure (SOP) for the police stations. The SOP which was circulated to all district police officers includes a timeline for handling each type of complaint, officers said. For example, in cases of child pornography or harassing children by misusing their identity, it is mandatory to start processing the complaint, calling the victims, and getting in touch with the online service provider within 24 hours. The SOP shows that in case police do not find sufficient evidence to file an FIR, then the action taken report should be filed within 14 days,” reads the SOP circular.Deputy commissioner of police (DCP) KPS Malhotra, head of the city’s cyber cell, now called the Intelligence Fusion and Strategic Operations (IFSO), said, “ The dedicated stations will ensure that justice is delivered to complainants. Earlier, there were cyber cell teams in each district but now we will have dedicated stations. We urge residents to visit these stations with their complaints. The IFSO is also there to deal with complex cyber crimes that need investigation at a larger level.”In the backdrop of rising online crimes reported by citizens across the city, the Central government on November 17 notified the new police stations to tackle common online crimes such as phishing, cheating, child pornography, and online harassment, among others. Documents seen by HT shows that for each station a budget of around ₹ 2 crore, to buy forensic tools, has already been approved by the police headquarters. There will be at least 38 personnel tasked with investigations. The police station will be headed by an officer of the rank of assistant police commissioner and assisted by three inspectors, eight sub-inspectors and others. To ensure that investigation of cyber crimes remains the only focus of these stations, personnel from the cyber crime police station will not be engaged in law and order duties, officers said.For online frauds or cheating case, the time period given to the investigating officer is a week and the action taken report must be filed within five weeks, the SOP stated.Since the pandemic lockdown last year, online crimes had seen a meteoric rise, police sources said. Police have in the past attributed the rise to more people working from homes and using the internet more, especially to shop. According to police data, while they received about 1,500 to 2,000 cyber crime complaints every month preceding the lockdown, the number of such cases during the lockdown, between April and August, 2020, increased to around 3,000 to 4,500 a month. The cases decreased once the lockdown restrictions were eased and the police currently get about 3,000 to 3,500 complaints every month.Cyber Expert Amit Dubey said such police stations should have been started years ago. “ It is never too late though. We saw how cyber criminals across the country were active last year. Having cyber police stations will ensure that trained officers, who have skills and knowledge (unlike other police personnel posted in regular local stations) to deal with cyber frauds, are dealing with the cases. Police, however, must ensure that the cases are brought to a logical end at these stations. Crimes will only stop the day people are prosecuted.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sop-released-for-newly-formed-cyber-police-stations-in-delhi-101637779286718.html

25-11-2021||Delhi||DDA flats allottees say agency demanding money, but houses unfinished||Allottees of the Delhi Development Authority’s 2021 housing scheme, which was launched in January, have said that the agency has asked them to make the payment by January next year even as 348 flats in Dwarka are still under construction.The allottees demanded the DDA to extend the date of payment by a few months or till the land-owning agency is in a position to hand over the flats.The allotment of these Middle Income Group (MIG) category flats was put on hold by the DDA immediately after the draw of lots was conducted in March this year, as the construction work was not complete. The DDA put 1,353 flats on sale in its housing scheme of 2021.“Why has the DDA issued demand-cum-allotment letters to us when the flats are not ready?” said Ashish Seghal, an allottee.He added, “We have been asked to deposit the money by mid-January next year. After that we will have to pay a penalty. I visited the site last week. There is a lot of work which is pending. The Sewerage Treatment Plant is yet to be constructed, the park is yet to be developed, finishing work is pending.”The allottees also questioned the land-owning agency’s decision to put these flats on sale when the construction work was not complete.Arun Aggarwal, another allottee, said, “The DDA is yet to get fire clearance for the buildings. Can DDA assure us that we will be able to move into our flats by January end? Moreover, while other allottees were given an extension to pay the full amount, we have been given just three months. We want the DDA to extend the payment duration. We have taken up the matter with the DDA.”The buyers also asked why DDA was levying 10% surcharge on the cost of flats in Dwarka. Aggarwal said, “This surcharge has not been levied on MIG flats in Vasant Kunj. It is usually levied on High Income Group (HIG) flats. The parameters for all MIG flats should be the same.”A senior DDA official, who is aware of the development, said, “We have applied for fire clearance and the remaining construction work will be completed soon. We will be handing over the flats to people in January. So far no extension is being considered for payment.”Meanwhile, of the 1,353 flats, close to 400 have been returned by allottees so far. DDA is planning to come out with another housing scheme to dispose of the flats returned by allottees of past housing schemes. Close to 15,000 flats will be put on sale again in December, the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dda-flats-allottees-say-agency-demanding-money-but-houses-unfinished-101637779224796.html
25-11-2021||Noida||Greater Noida: Farmer issues will be resolved on priority, says addl chief secy||To ensure that farmer protests do not spoil the grand foundation laying ceremony of the Noida international airport on Thursday, the Uttar Pradesh government on Wednesday interacted with farmers and promised to address their grievances on priority.A section of farmers, whose land is acquired for the airport project in Jewar, Greater Noida, are angry for multiple reasons that include a hefty fee that is being charged for getting an electricity connection in the airport township, where displaced farmers are being rehabilitated. Also, some farmers are yet to get plots farmers and the services at the township are incomplete, farmers have alleged.Additional chief secretary SP Goyal, along with other officials, on Thursday inspected the township in Jewar Bangar and also interacted with farmers to understand their issues.“Farmers are happy with the airport as it has changed their life and, in the future, it will create huge opportunities for them as it will for the entire region. We interacted with farmers at the township and they all are happy with the airport project,” said Goyal.Farmers said basic facilities such as a cremation ground have not been provided in the airport township.“The Gautam Budh Nagar administration is yet to provide residential plots to some farmers and also fulfil its promises on jobs. The administration should settle all issues related to rehabilitation without delay,” said Mukesh Kumar, a farmer from Rohi village.The administration acquired and handed over 1,334 hectares of land to airport concessionaire who has already taken possession of the land. And the administration is now in the process of acquiring another 1,365 hectares for the second phase of the greenfield airport. However, farmers are demanding higher compensation this time.Asked about these concerns, Goyal said, “The administration is already addressing every issue of farmers and it will continue to resolve their issues on priority. We acquired the 1,334 hectares under phase 1 with the support of farmers. Similarly, we will do so for the second phase as well. It is quite visible that farmers are supporting this project happily as it will create opportunities for them — the land rate has already picked up in Jewar and other villages nearby.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/greater-noida-farmer-issues-will-be-resolved-on-priority-says-addl-chief-secy-101637779164993.html

25-11-2021||Pune||Jumbo centres to stay in Pune as active Covid cases rise in 2 weeks||Even as the perception that the number of Covid-19 cases is going down has led to people lowering their guard and more commercial activities opening up, Pune city is witnessing a rise in the number of active cases. In the last two weeks, the number of active Covid-19 cases in Pune city alone has jumped from 647 to 823. While the number of critical cases has not shown any drastic change due to patients resorting to temporary solutions and over-the-counter medication according to doctors, the surge in active cases has prompted the civic body not to shut down jumbo centres, yet.State health minister Rajesh Tope on Tuesday hinted that while the Covid-19 task force is in favour of opening primary classes (Classes 1 to 4) as the number of cases is going down, a large number of new cases are being seen in the 11 to 20 years’ age group. While the number of cases continued to fall post- Ganpati, Navratri and Dassera despite the huge gatherings witnessed, the situation seems a bit alarming post-Diwali. As per Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) data, in the past two weeks between November 8 and 24, the number of active Covid-19 cases has risen by 176. However, the number of critical cases has not changed during this time.Dr Pradeep Suryavanshi, paediatrician with multiple hospitals in the city, said, “We are not seeing a rise in the number of children admitted to hospitals but we do get to know from their parents much later that they took off-the-counter medication which suppressed the symptoms at the time which could re-emerge later.” Despite a lower hospitalisation rate however, the PMC is not yet firm on shutting down the jumbo centres and is keeping its hospitals ready in case of any surge in Covid-19 cases in future.Ravindra Bhinwade, additional municipal commissioner, said, “As of now, the jumbo centres are shut as there is no need for them as we are also opening up our other hospitals which were earlier only dedicated to Covid-19 patients. While the number of hospitalised patients has gone down, we hope we don’t have to restart the Covid-19 centres. However, if the number rises, we can always restart them and we have our staff on standby. As far as shutting down or dismantling the centres is concerned, the decision will be taken by the deputy chief minister during the Covid-19 review meeting and we will act accordingly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/jumbo-centres-to-stay-in-pune-as-active-covid-cases-rise-in-2-weeks-101637779105753.html

Earlier, they had held similar protests outside the residences of Gautam Budh Nagar member of Parliament Dr Mahesh Sharma and Noida MLA Pankaj Singh.According to police, farmers, led by Sukhbir Khalifa, the founder president of Bharatiya Kisan Parishad, blocked traffic at the Zero Point of the expressway, thereby triggering an over 5km long traffic jam.“The farmers blocked the expressway and violated Section 144 CrPC due to which traffic was blocked on the road. Ambulances carrying patients also got stuck in the jam. The jam was over 5km long and roads were blocked by protesters for over two and a half hours. It was only after police force reached the spot, along with senior officials, that traffic movement was restored,” said Sanjay Kumar Singh, station house officer, Knowledge Park Police Station.The officials said an FIR was filed under the Indian Penal Code sections 147 (rioting), 341 (wrongful restraint), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 332 (voluntarily causing hurt.), 353 (assault or criminal force) and 504 (intentional insult to provoke breach of peace), and provisions of the Epidemic Diseases Act against Khalifa and 228 other identified and unidentified people.When asked, Khalifa said protesters were stopped from going to Dadri MLA’s house which is why the traffic was blocked on the expressway.“We were on our way to stage a sit-in protest outside the residence of Dadri MLA Tejpal Nagar in a civilised manner. However, the MLA along with police reached the Zero Point to stop us, and told us that he is leaving for Uttar Pradesh chief minister’s event. He told us to put forward our demands right there on the expressway. So how can we be held responsible for the jam?” he said.

25-11-2021||Delhi||Administrators welcome decision to reopen schools in Delhi, parents hesitant||School administrators in the Capital welcomed the government’s decision to allow the reopening of schools for in-person classes from Monday, while parents said they were hesitant.Schools in Delhi were asked to suspend in-person classes on November 13 on account of a spike in pollution, barely two weeks after they had reopened for all students for the first time since March last year.School heads said that the learning gap was exacerbated due to frequent school closures and sought that schools be allowed to function without further disruptions.Sudha Acharya, the principal of ITL Public School, Dwarka, and chairperson of the National Progressive School’s Conference, a consortium of over 120 private Delhi schools, welcomed the decision.“The reopening of schools was much needed. Students have stayed away from school for a very long time and it’s time that they return to the classrooms. Parents can also make preparations in the next few days before Monday’s reopening,” said Acharya.She said that the school was planning to reopen for students in senior classes followed by students in other grades, since a number of classrooms would be occupied by students appearing for the board exams. “At least students in classes 9 and 11 should start coming to school from Monday so that we can hold exams that were disrupted due to the abrupt closure of schools,” said Acharya.Bharat Arora, general secretary, Action Committee of Unaided Schools, said that it was unfortunate that schools had been closed for a prolonged period on account of the pandemic and pollution. He said that it was imperative that all stakeholders, including policymakers, work together for the resumption of schools.“Most rural schools under our umbrella had reported good attendance before they were closed due to pollution. They are looking forward to reopening successfully once again,” said Arora.He said that schools had taken consent from parents for transportation services earlier and were working towards the resumption of bus services.Arora added that schools that were serving as CBSE board exam centres will have to make some adjustments before the resumption of in-person classes.Sukhbir Singh Yadav, president of Vice and Principals’ Association of Delhi, and head of a government school in Rohini, also said that the school will have to meticulously plan the timetable to ensure that regular classes are held smoothly along with the board examination. The school will be conducting term-end examinations for students in non-board classes starting next week.“From December 1, term-end exams will also start. We will have to conduct both the home exams and board exams and make arrangements accordingly,” said Yadav.Parents had mixed feelings regarding the resumption of in-person classes from Monday.Aprajita Gautam, president, Delhi Parents’ Association, said that the decision to reopen schools from November 29 was hasty.“Looking at the current pollution levels, we believe that if the government decides to delay the opening of schools for a few more days and at the same time decides to run school buses for more convenience, then it will be much better,” said Gautam.Nidhi Mehta, a parent whose daughter studies in Class 4, said that while she was not eager to send her daughter to school, her daughter was looking forward to it.“While I am not very enthused about sending my daughter to school right now, she is eagerly waiting to go back. Since the number of students is expected to be low, I don’t think it will be an issue if she goes to school. We were satisfied with the protocols adopted by the school when it reopened earlier this month,” said Mehta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/administrators-welcome-decision-to-reopen-schools-in-delhi-parents-hesitant-101637777664796.html
25-11-2021||Lucknow||Rebel Congress lawmaker Aditi Singh, BSP MLA Bandana Singh join BJP||Rebel Congress lawmaker from Rae Bareli (Sadar) assembly seat Aditi Singh, 34, along with Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) MLA Bandana Singh joined the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Lucknow on Wednesday.Both women are first-time lawmakers and had won the 2017 UP assembly polls from politically key constituencies. Aditi Singh is from Rae Bareli, the Lok Sabha constituency which Congress chief Sonia Gandhi has been winning since 2004 and which the BJP has now set its sights on. Bandana Singh is the MLA from Sagri in Azamgarh, the Lok Sabha constituency of Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav. Though part of a larger plan to unsettle the Congress and the SP in their bastions in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, BJP leaders admit that the joining of these two women MLAs has an immediate relevance: the 2022 UP assembly elections. “So far, Priyanka Gandhi, who has been very active hasn’t revealed, if she would contest the 2022 UP polls and from where? Chances are that she might settle for the only surviving family bastion in Rae Bareli and if that happens, we have our plans in place. If that doesn’t happen, we will be better prepared for 2024 in this region. As for the SP, its chief Akhilesh Yadav had, after denying plans to contest 2022 elections, subsequently dropped hints that he might. If he does contest, or fields his wife Dimple, then of course, Azamgarh, where SP has an impressive track record, could be an obvious choice for them. If nothing else, these opposition names would help build atmosphere against the Congress, SP and the BSP,” a BJP leader said. UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh, too, while keeping mum on if the party would field the two on the BJP ticket in forthcoming 2022 UP polls, did admit that the women lawmakers from the opposition were key takeaways that his party would capitalise on. “Two popular women lawmakers have joined the BJP, one to take on Sonia and Priyanka and the other for Akhilesh and Dimple Yadav,” he said. Priyanka Gandhi had recently launched the Congress campaign, promising 40% tickets to women in 2022 UP polls, but the state BJP chief said the joining of women from opposition ranks was proof which party had done more for women empowerment. Azamgarh has been a Samajwadi Party bastion as the party had won nine of the 10 assembly seats in 2012 and even in the subsequent BJP wave in 2017 UP polls, it had won five assembly seats there. Bandana Singh’s husband Sarvesh had contested the 2007 polls on Samajwadi Party ticket and had joined the BSP in 2010. In 2012, he contested as BSP candidate and lost to the SP. In 2013, Sarvesh was murdered after which Bandana Singh had contested the 2017 elections and won as a BSP MLA. BSP chief Mayawati had suspended Bandana Singh and six other party MLAs in October 2020 after they opposed the nomination of the party’s official candidate Ramji Gautam for the elections to the Rajya Sabha.“I am very impressed with Modi-Yogi,” said Aditi Singh who had resisted the BJP wave in the 2017 UP elections by winning her seat. The BJP made inroads in Rae Bareli by winning three of the five assembly seats for the first time in 2017 elections. In 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the BJP got Congress MLC Dinesh Pratap Singh, a key aide of Sonia Gandhi in Rae Bareli, to defect to BJP and later made him contest against Sonia. The BJP staged a major upset, defeating the then Congress chief Rahul Gandhi from adjoining Amethi Lok Sabha constituency. In Rae Bareli, though Dinesh Pratap Singh lost to Sonia, he later played a key role in BJP win in the panchayat polls in the Congress bastion, party leaders admitted. Aditi Singh, who was given ‘Y’ category security by the Yogi Adityanath government had praised the abrogation of Article 370, granting special status to Jammu and Kashmir by the BJP government. She had in 2019 also attended the 36-hour assembly session convened by UP BJP government to celebrate the 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi despite the fact that all major opposition parties, including the Samajwadi Party, the Bahujan Samaj Party and the Congress, had boycotted the special session. “We aren’t upset at these developments because with opportunists out, we can safely surmise that those who have remained are true soldiers of the Congress party. The party has suffered due to black sheep, which remained within and harmed the party,” said Congress leader Zeeshan Haider.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/rebel-congress-lawmaker-aditi-singh-bsp-mla-vandana-singh-join-bjp-101637768664411.html
25-11-2021||Lucknow||Akhilesh announces ₹25 lakh aid for kin of farmers who died during stir||Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav on Wednesday announced financial aid of ₹25 lakh to every family of those farmers who lost their lives in the agitation against the three new agriculture reform laws in the past one year.The aid of ₹25 lakh would be given soon after formation of an SP government in Uttar Pradesh, a party spokesman said.“SP chief Akhilesh Yadav has promised to give a sum of ₹25 lakh as Kisan Shahadat Samman Rashi to the family of every farmer who died in the agitation against the three farm laws,” said SP spokesman Rajendra Chaudhary in a press statement issued here.Chaudhary said former chief minister Akhilesh Yadav has always remained sensitive towards the issues of farmers. He said the Akhilesh Yadav-led SP government (2012-17) had implemented a number of welfare schemes for farmers.He also said policies about remunerative prices, cheaper power to farmers, free irrigation and availability of fertilisers to farmers were the result of the policies of the SP government.He said under Akhilesh Yadav’s leadership, the SP was always with the farmers. The SP strongly opposed the three farm laws and farmers have been framed in different cases by the BJP government, Chaudhary said. He said a large number of farmers, too, went to jail during the period.Uttar Pradesh government spokesman and senior minister Sidharth Nath Singh has meanwhile reacted sharply to the SP chief’s move to give aid as his “fake” concern for the farmers. Singh said the farmers understood this was another gimmick of the SP ahead of the 2022 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/akhilesh-yadav-announces-25-lakh-financial-assistance-for-kin-of-farmers-who-died-during-agitation-101637766504156.html
25-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s air quality slips back to ‘very poor’ category; shallow fog likely||Parts of New Delhi were likely to be shrouded in shallow fog on Wednesday morning, while the Capital’s air quality yet again plunged to the “very poor” category.The hourly air quality index (AQI) reading at 7am was 350, according to data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). On Tuesday, the average 24-hour AQI was 290, which was in the “poor” category. The CPCB classifies an AQI of zero to 50 as “good”, 51-100 as “satisfactory”, 101-200 as “moderate”, 201-300 as “poor”, 301-400 as “very poor” and above 401 as “severe”.On the weather front, the minimum temperature was likely to be 9 degrees Celsius on Wednesday and the maximum of 27 degrees Celsius, according to the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) forecast. Also Read: Behind differing farm fire counts: Satellite resolution, methodologyNew Delhi’s minimum temperature on Tuesday was 10.3 degrees Celsius and the maximum temperature was 26.7 degrees Celsius. According to the IMD’s weekly forecast, shallow fog in the morning is likely till Saturday morning. The city’s minimum temperature is expected to stay between 9 and 11 degrees Celsius over the next three days. On Tuesday, the union ministry of earth sciences’ air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), said the AQI is likely to be in the “poor” and “lower end of very poor” categories till Friday. “Winds at transport level are likely to slow down and also change direction from the northwest to south-southeast tomorrow and north or northwest on Thursday. Local surface winds are also relatively low for the next three days that reduces dispersion of pollutants leading to deterioration. The net effect is that air quality is likely to be in the ‘poor’ or ‘lower end of very poor’ categories for the next three days,” the SAFAR predicted.SAFAR said local surface winds are likely to pick up soon, resulting in an improvement in New Delhi’s air quality from Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-air-quality-slips-back-to-very-poor-category-shallow-fog-likely-101637722460733.html
25-11-2021||Delhi||‘Pollution down by at least 15% as a result of air panel’s curbs’||Pollution levels in Delhi went down by at least 15% as a result of the curbs implemented by the Commission for Air Quality Management in Delhi-NCR and adjoining areas (CAQM), observations by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology’s (IITM) Early Warning System has shown, even as experts asked why the forecasts were not used to announce pre-emptive measures.Scientists at IITM, Pune said that when CAQM announced a slew of directives for Delhi and NCR states to control pollution sources on November 16, the EWS predicted the air quality in the national capital to slip into the ‘severe’ category on November 17 and November 18. But, the 4pm average air quality index of Delhi remained in the very poor category.IITM scientists attributed this to the restrictions on polluting activities such as construction, thermal power plants and truck movement in the NCR.Air levels in Delhi were consistently in the poor zone since October 27, and plunged further to very poor between November 2 and 4 (the day Diwali was celebrated). Between November 5 and 13, Delhi recorded seven ‘severe’ air quality days.Taking cognisance of the persistent poor run of air quality, the Supreme Court on November 13 ordered the Delhi and central governments to take emergent measures to curb hazardous levels of air pollution in the national capital. The same day, the Delhi government announced shutting of schools, banned construction and announced work from home for the government staff.The CAQM held a meeting, on the orders of the Supreme Court, on November 16, and announced ban on construction activities, ordered schools to shut down and prohibited entry of trucks into Delhi till November 21. The federal panel is expected to decide on the continuation of these measures in a meeting on Wednesday.“When the commission announced these measures, our air quality forecasts for the week were already in place. We did not recalibrate it to see the difference and found that instead of falling into the severe zone, the AQI in Delhi showed an improvement because the polluting sources were not contributing as much as they did on a regular day,” said Sachin Ghude, a scientist at IITM Pune.The EWS observations showed that on November 16, the day the directions were announced by the CAQM, the AQI forecast for Delhi was 391 and the final recorded AQI that day was 393, a difference of only two points.On November 17, the EWS forecast said that the AQI may touched 487, the highest AQI value that Delhi would have recorded this season. However, with the pollution restrictions, the AQI levels settled in the very poor category, with a reading of 355 on the EWS scale. Similarly, on November 18, the forecast said that the AQI should have been 414, also in the severe zone, but the actual recording was 357.The AQI recordings of EWS are slightly different from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data because of the different technology used by the two agencies. According to CPCB, Delhi recorded an average AQI of 403 on November 16, 375 on November 17 and 347 on November 18.“We have now recalibrated our forecasts keeping the restrictions. But our observations do say that Delhi saw around a 15-22% reduction in pollution levels because of these measures by the CAQM,” Ghude added.Scientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said better wind speed also played an important role in the improvement of air quality during the period for which the IITM analysed its forecast data.A senior Met official, who asked not to be named, said that from November 16 to November 19, Delhi was battling low wind speeds and considerably unfavourable ventilation conditions, which was not allowing pollutants to disperse easily. But, wind speed improved from November 20, played a huge role in improved air quality.“The winds were in the low to moderate range till Friday, after which it improved. The stubble burning instances have also been on the lower end throughout last week. All these factors cannot be ignored while assessing the reasons behind an improvement in air quality,” a senior Met official explained.Environment experts said the post-Diwali toxic air spell in the Capital could have been prevented if the commission had implemented these measures earlier.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) said forecast-based forecast-based monitoring of pollution needs to be leveraged in order to ensure pre-emptive action“What stopped the agencies to take this action when Delhi had already recorded so many severe air days right after Diwali? Agencies need to focus on pre-emptive action based on air quality forecasts to prevent such spikes,” Roychowdhury said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/pollution-down-by-at-least-15-as-a-result-of-air-panel-s-curbs-101637694415224.html
25-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi air may improve as wind speed picks up: IMD||After nearly 20 days of breathing hazardous air this month, Delhi’s air quality is set to improve marginally from November 21, India Meteorological Department (IMD) scientists said Friday.Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data shows that Delhi’s overall Air Quality Index (AQI) reading on Friday was 380, categorised as “very poor”. While this was a few points higher than Thursday’s 347, also considered “very poor” on CPCB’s AQI scale, forecasters said they expect wind speed to improve from Sunday, facilitating the dispersion of pollutants.An AQI reading between 201 and 300 is considered “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.“While the winds will continue to blow from the northwest, the speed will pick up and this will help disperse the accumulated pollutants. We are hoping that after November 21, the AQI will come down to the ‘poor’ range,” said VK Soni, head of IMD’s environment and research centre.Soni explained that another factor for the improvement of air quality during the weekend is the reduction in the stubble fire count in the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana.Union ministry of earth science’ air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), said that on Friday, 1,077 fires were recorded in both the states, which contributed to 3% of the Capital’s PM2.5 (ultrafine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) levels. According to experts, PM2.5 is the dominant pollutant in the region.Meanwhile, the temperature in Delhi remained in the normal range. Forecasters said that while the city usually sees at least three or four western disturbances in the month of November, this year it has not experienced an active western disturbance since October 24.A western disturbance refers to an area of “disturbed” or reduced air pressure, moving from the west to the east, carrying with it moisture associated with rainfall, snowfall and fog in northern India.On Friday, the maximum temperature recorded at the Safdarjung weather station, which is the official marker for the city, was 25.9 degrees Celsius, two degrees below normal for this time of the year. The minimum temperature was 10.9 degrees Celsius, a notch below normal.“If we experience a western disturbance, the temperature will see a drastic drop,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change), Skymet Weather Services.River of smokeOn Friday, American space agency Nasa on Friday shared several satellite images (that were taken on November 11) of farm fires-- which have led to a spike in the levels of air pollution in Delhi -- spreading all the way across the Indo-Gangetic plains as a thick plume of smoke. In the images, the Capital is almost completely shrouded by the smoke, which continues well beyond Agra, with Nasa indicating this is likely to have affected over 22 million people in a single day.The images were taken by Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the Suomi NPP satellite on November 11, Nasa informed on its blog.“Looking at the size of the plume on November 11 and the population density in this area, I would say that a conservative estimate is that at least 22 million people were affected by smoke on this one day,” said Pawan Gupta, a Universities Space Research Association (USRA) scientist at Nasa’s Marshall Space Flight Center.Delhi’s air quality was in the “severe” category on November 11, with AQI of 411, with the government forecasting body Safar pegging the share of farm fire contribution to Delhi’s PM 2.5 to be 26% that day.According to Safar, while the contribution from farm fires has reduced, the local wind speed is calm, thereby trapping pollutants. “Local surface winds are low at the moment with moderate ventilation of near surface pollutants. From Sunday onwards, surface winds are likely to be strong resulting in effective dispersion that improves air quality,” it said.In the blog, Nasa scientists said while lingering monsoon rain kept fire activity low for a few weeks longer than usual, elevated fire activity was observed in November. They added that fires in northern Pakistan also likely contributed to some of the smoke on November 11.According to experts, meteorological conditions and other factors can also contribute to hazy skies, with dust from the Thar desert contributing to the haze on November 12, 2021, a separate image shared by the space agency showed.Hiren Jethva, an USRA scientist based at Nasa’s Goddard Space Flight Center, who uses measures of “greenness,” or Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to anticipate fire activity each year, said this summer has seen one of the largest NDVI values in the last 20 years, based on which he had predicted this season to record a fairly high fire count. The data he uses comes from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Nasa’s Aqua satellite.“I had predicted this would be one of the most active fire seasons on record, and that is exactly what we have seen,” said Jethva. “We still have a few weeks of burning to go, but already Aqua MODIS has detected more than 17,000 hotspots in Punjab and Haryana—making this the most active fire season on record.”Data from the last decade shows stubble burning is generally at its most active between October 15 and November 15, with a drop in activity seen from the third week of November onwards. LS Kurinji, Programme Associate at the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), says after a late spike in the number of farm fires this year, numbers have started dropping again with less than 1,000 fire counts recorded in the last two days.“Previously, scientific reports indicated that it takes 14-22 hours for smoke from Punjab and Haryana to reach Delhi under favourable meteorological conditions. Data from Safar indicates that on days when winds blew from the northwest, the contribution of stubble burning to Delhi’s PM2.5 level was in the range of 20-50% this year,” she explained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-air-may-improve-as-wind-speed-picks-up-imd-101637347631548.html
25-11-2021||World||China lodges protest over CDS Rawat calling it India’s biggest security threat||China on Thursday accused India’s chief of defence staff (CDS) Bipin Rawat of instigating a “geopolitical confrontation” and violating strategic guidelines after he said China is India’s biggest security threat earlier this month.The Chinese defence ministry called the remarks “irresponsible” and “dangerous”, and said it had “made solemn representations” against Rawat’s comments to the Indian establishment.China is the biggest security threat facing India, “much bigger” than Pakistan, Rawat had said at a summit earlier this month, adding, however, that India is prepared to deal with “any misadventure” on the “land borders or the high seas”.In response to a question whether China was India’s number one enemy, Rawat said “no doubt” and added: “The threat on the northern borders is much bigger.”A lack of “trust” and growing “suspicion” is coming in the way of resolving the border dispute between the nuclear-armed neighbours, Bipin Rawat added in context of the ongoing Sino-India military friction in eastern Ladakh.The Chinese defence ministry reacted strongly to Rawat’s remarks at the monthly press conference in Beijing on Thursday.“The unprovoked hype of the so-called ‘Chinese military threat’ by Indian officials seriously violates the strategic guidelines of the leaders of the two countries on the ‘not a threat to each other’,” ministry spokesperson, Colonel Wu Qian said, responding to a question at a press conference on Thursday.“It is irresponsible and dangerous to instigate geopolitical confrontation. We expressed firm opposition to this and made solemn representations to the Indian side,” Wu added.“China’s position on the China-India boundary issue is clear and unambiguous: The Chinese border troops are determined to safeguard national sovereignty and security. At the same time, they are committed to maintaining peace and tranquillity in the border area and make great efforts to ease and cool down the situation,” Wu said.“As a neighbouring country, we hope that India and China will meet each other halfway, jointly maintain peace and tranquillity in the border area, and jointly maintain the sound development of bilateral relations,” the spokesperson said.Indian and Chinese militaries have been locked in a border standoff in eastern Ladakh since May, 2020, when a violent clash in Pangong lake area led to both sides gradually deploying tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry along the border.Several rounds of military and diplomatic talks have only resulted in partial disengagement of troops until now.In October, China accused India of “unreasonable and unrealistic demands” in an unusually aggressive statement issued at the end of the 13th round of military talks held to resolve the dragging standoff in the Ladakh area.India has repeatedly and consistently rejected China’s allegations that Indian troops crossed over to the Chinese side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, asserting that New Delhi has always taken a responsible approach towards border management and maintaining peace and tranquillity in the border areas.Russia, India, China foreign ministers to meetThe foreign ministers of Russia, India and China (RIC) will hold their annual meeting via video link on Friday, the Chinese foreign ministry announced on Thursday.Friday’s meeting will be the 18th round of talks between the three countries under the RIC mechanism.Chinese state councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi will attend the RIC foriegn ministers meeting via video link on November 26, foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian announced on Thursday.Wang will join Indian external affairs minister S Jaishankar and Russia foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov in the meeting.Under the RIC framework, the foreign ministers of the three countries meet periodically to discuss bilateral, regional and international issues of their interest. “During the upcoming meeting, China expects to boost communications, strengthen mutual trust and reach a consensus with Russia and India, sending a positive signal to the world,” Zhao said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-lodges-protest-over-cds-rawat-calling-it-india-s-biggest-security-threat-101637847869334.html
25-11-2021||World||WHO discusses new Covid variant possibly evolved in untreated AIDS patient. What we know so far||World Health Organization (WHO) officials on Thursday met to discuss a new coronavirus variant carrying an “unusual constellation of mutations”. The coronavirus variant B.1.1529 has been identified circulating in South Africa and Botswana, triggering fresh concerns of another Covid-19 wave in the region. The identification of the new variant prompted a hastily-called press conference by virologist Tulio de Oliveira."Unfortunately we have detected a new variant which is a reason for concern in South Africa," de Oliveira told the news conference.South Africa was the first country to detect the Beta variant, which was later labelled as a ‘variant of concern’ by the UN health agency due to its transmissibility and ability to evade vaccine-induced immunity. The National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) said in a statement that the South African scientists are working to understand the potential implications of the new variant found in 22 Covid cases following genome sequencing."Although the data are limited, our experts are working overtime with all the established surveillance systems to understand the new variant and what the potential implications could be," the statement quoted the NICD's Professor Adrian Puren as saying.Scientists detect new Covid-19 variant in South Africa: ReportOn Wednesday, Francois Balloux, professor of computational systems biology and director at UCL Genetics Institute, said that the variant likely evolved during chronic infection of an immunocompromised person, given the large number of mutations it has accumulated apparently in a single burst. In a press release by Science Media Centre, Balloux said the immunocompromised person was possibly an untreated HIV/AIDS patient.“It is difficult to know what to make of the carriage of both P681H and N679K. It is a combination we see only exceptionally rarely. I suspect it is generally not ‘stable’, but it might be so, in combination with other mutations/deletions,” the expert said.“I would definitely expect it to be poorly recognised by neutralising antibodies relative to Alpha or Delta. It is difficult to predict how transmissible it may be at this stage,” he added.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-discusses-new-covid-variant-possibly-evolved-in-untreated-aids-patient-what-do-we-know-so-far-101637839602963.html
25-11-2021||World||Amid Europe’s Covid-19 crisis, UK paying deadly price. Here's why||The U.K.’s success at avoiding the latest virus emergency ripping across the European continent has come at a price.Thanks to an aggressive booster campaign for older and vulnerable people, the country has managed to keep hospitalization and death rates relatively steady without imposing fresh restrictions. Meanwhile, lockdowns are being reimposed elsewhere in a bid to damp down another Covid wildfire.However, more U.K. residents have died of Covid per capita than in most other western European countries, despite earlier access to vaccines than in the European Union.  “The U.K. has been ‘running hot’,” said Devi Sridhar, a professor of global public health at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. “We act like Europe is so much worse, but we’ve just accepted a higher death toll and higher infection rates for longer.”The tally of deaths has risen in particular since July, when Prime Minister Boris Johnson scrapped all restrictions, even mandatory masks. Daily numbers are currently running almost five times higher than in the weeks before his much-ballyhooed “Freedom Day.” The varying virus trends across countries have created an intense political debate about the best way to beat back the pandemic’s latest wave. Austria has gone for a full lockdown and threatened to make vaccinations compulsory, while Italy and Germany are toughening measures on the unvaccinated.The U.K. is the poster child of the opposing strategy, instead relying heavily on boosters to keep deaths and hospitalizations to a manageable level. Johnson has warned of a Covid “blizzard from the east” but indicated there’s no plan to change the rules on masks or to adopt vaccine certificates, which many EU countries have imposed. While Britain looks in better shape now, at least relative to some of its neighbors, it’s still unclear how the two models will play out over the Christmas holidays and beyond. During a previous Covid wave last winter, the U.K. initially pushed down virus numbers more quickly than EU countries, only to see cases flare anew later in the new year. That spike was subsequently contained amid a rapid vaccine rollout. But national immunization rates alone don’t tell the whole story. In Germany, only about 86% of the population age 60 and up -- a bracket that accounts for more than 90% of the country’s Covid deaths -- has been vaccinated, meaning 3.4 million highly vulnerable people have yet to receive shots. In the U.K., significantly more than 90% of that age group has been inoculated.One thing that EU countries can learn from the U.K. is the importance of zeroing in on the people who most need shots, said Mike Ryan, head of the World Health Organization’s health emergencies program.“Governments should know exactly who has not been vaccinated and move away from blunt percentages to missed individuals,” he said Wednesday. “The U.K. has really led the world in how to look at data.”Given the stakes for health-care systems and economies, some European health officials say governments don’t have the luxury to pick and choose their policies. In their view, whatever can be done, must be done.The alternative is an “overload in the health system over the next two months,” said Andrea Ammon, director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. “We do not have the choice between either vaccination or non-pharmaceutical interventions. We have to do both.”Meanwhile, politicians are scrambling to get control of the situation in their respective countries. Slovakia, which has had among the world’s worst increases in cases in the past week, on Wednesday announced a new lockdown. France, on the other hand, is following the U.K. and resisting such dramatic moves. With just months to go before President Emmanuel Macron faces elections, the government says it wants to avoid “closures, curfews or lockdowns.”Exactly why the U.K.’s high Covid case numbers have not resulted in more deaths of late is probably due to a complicated mix of factors. The country reported more than 43,000 new infections on Wednesday, among the highest levels in Europe and consistent with daily tallies since July, along with 149 deaths. Boosters may be helping to protect the most vulnerable. Almost 16 million people have received their third shot, versus 6.6 million in Germany.The sluggish vaccine rollout for young people could also be a factor. The spread of infections has been particularly pronounced among school goers, and children are less likely to suffer severe illness or die from Covid.“It’s all about population immunity,” said David Heymann, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “Population immunity in the U.K. is likely very high because the virus has been permitted to circulate in the communities.” AstraZeneca Plc Chief Executive Pascal Soriot claimed this week that the U.K.’s heavy reliance on the company’s vaccine for older people, might be helping to hold down the death rate. The Astra shot, he said, may offer greater long-term effectiveness -- something U.K. scientists have shown is not the case.“The U.K. has more immunity than many places, because of both infections and vaccination,” said Graham Medley, a member of the government’s Covid advisory panel and an LSHTM professor. “If people keep getting vaccinated and getting their boosters, and keep testing to limit transmission, then the U.K. might not have to introduce any more measures to reduce the number of patients in hospital.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-europe-s-covid-19-crisis-uk-paying-deadly-price-here-s-why-101637837810426.html

Within hours, it was no longer possible for her to go back because of the extensive flooding on the highway. Corduroy is one the many Canadians who have been affected by landslides and flooding in British Columbia last week brought on by massive rains, which experts say have been made worse by climate change.A weather system known as an “atmospheric river” resulted in huge storm hitting Pacific north-west last week. “Atmospheric rivers are relatively long, narrow regions in the atmosphere – like rivers in the sky – that transport most of the water vapour outside of the tropics”, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration website. They move with the weather, dumping the water vapour that they carry in the form of rain or snow once they make landfall. “The west coast of Canada is accustomed to wet winters, especially during La Nina events like the one we are experiencing. But nothing like this has happened before,” says Dr Simon Donner Professor of Climatology at the University of British Columbia. “Rainfall during this ‘atmospheric river’ event absolutely shattered records.”The highest rainfall was seen along the border between US and Canada. The Canadian province of British Columbia received 150 to 200 mm of rain, with some places receiving more than a months rain in two days. Canadian officials called the resulting deluge a “once-in-a-year” event, meaning that a flood of this size has a 0.2% (1 in 500) chance of occurring in any given year.Also Read: Catch them young: School climate education key for sustainable developmentAt least four deaths have been reported so far and thousands have been displaced. Canada’s third largest city and largest port, Vancouver, was completely cut off after it lost its rail and road links to landslides and destruction caused by the water.After it rained over the weekend, “The water became too much for the ditches, and the ground became too saturated, recounts Lindsay Kay, 31, a resident of the city of Chilliwack. “Our crawlspace began to fill up with water, and we began looking for ways to keep it out. We spent most of the night pumping water out of the crawlspace, but on Monday night we were notified that we were on evacuation alert, and early Tuesday morning we were advised that we would have to leave.”At the moment, Kay, her husband and her 9-month-old son, are staying with friends. They have a short term accommodation covered, and also have someplace to rent long term just in case. But they are holding on hope that they will still be able to go back home.“We know that so many people have been absolutely devastated by this flood. Not only did many lose their homes, but so many lost their businesses, livelihoods and animals as well,” says Kay.The Oryall family own a small hobby farm in Arnold, a small settlement on the western edge of the Sumas Prairie. They used to have more than forty chickens before the flooding, but only twelve of them survived the flooding, says Lindsey. On Tuesday, they began evacuating around 6am in the morning. Their main floor, despite being a few feet above the ground, was completely flooding.Lindsey and her husband, Ben, dropped their two children Charlie, 7, and Oliver, 3, and their dog off at her parents’ house in Chilliwack and then came back to evacuate their animals.“When we went back it was about 9:30, and we left at about 10:15, and in that 45 minutes, the water came up about two and a half feet and we — my husband and I — almost didn’t make it out safely,” she says.The signal from climate change The Oryall family moved into the farm on June 15. Now, just a few months later, they are already wondering if selling might be a good idea. “We have been looking for a farm like this for about eight years. We have been looking for our forever home and we finally found it. We are very happy,” says Lindsay.But her husband, she says, is having second thoughts mainly because of climate change. “If we’re going to have to go through this, even every ten years, with climate change continuing to get worse, how are we going to be able to afford this?”The family lives on floodplain, and like many others on the Sumas prairie, which is a high flood risk are, don’t have flood insurance. “This has been a devastating this for us financially,” she says. “We can see the signal of climate change in the intensity of the rainfall. It follows from basic physics that a warmer planet means heavier rainfall. Research also shows that the winter storm track will move north, bringing more intense rains to British Columbia,” says Dr. Donner, adding, “Whether rainfall turns into flooding, however, is very much about land use planning, and that planning is based on a past climate.”The floods don’t come completely unexpected. According to a Vancouver Sun report, scientists have been warning for at least three decades that British Columbia was facing a threat from climate change. A report from the auditor general in 2018 that warned that the “the province needs to be prepared” for the impact of climate change.“From 1900 to 2013, B.C.’s average temperature has increased faster than the global average. Scientists predict that the province will face increases in extreme weather, rising sea levels, increasing risk of wildfire and flooding, as well as a change in the location of ecosystems and species that live there,” it said, adding, “These events highlight the environmental, economic and social threats that climate change poses to the province.”The province has been forced to declare a climate-related state of emergency twice in the last six months. Over the summer, record-breaking temperatures resulted in a drought and wildfires. On June 29, temperatures reached as high as 49.6 degree Celsius (°C), breaking a previous record of 45.0°C set in July 1937.At least 569 people died between June and August as a result of the heat, and with more than 1,600 fires, the wildfire season this year was the third worst on record for the province, torching nearly 8,700 square kilometres of land. It consumed the village of Lytton, where at least two died.“The summer heat wave was an extremely rare event, but one that will become more likely to happen as the climate continues to warm,” says Dr Donner. “The forensic analysis done by a group of scientists found that the likelihood of such a heat wave may increase more than 100 times with 2 degrees of global warming.”At the moment, a key COP 26 climate conference report has concluded that the world is on track for more than 2°C of global heating. The extremely warm BC summer may also have had hand in why the floods were so particularly devastating. The fires and drought scorched the land in a way leaving it incapable of absorbing water. For now, it is difficult to tell extent of the damage that the region is facing till the flood waters recede.Unfortunately, it may not be any time soon. In another huge blow to the province, heavy rains have been forecasted for the region starting today. “The next storm system is set to arrive on the B.C. south coast tonight bringing heavy rain. The rain will be heaviest on Thursday as the storm moves across the south coast. The heavy rain will ease Thursday night as the system moves out of the region,” according to Environment Canada.“This may worsen recent flooding and impact vulnerable landscapes and infrastructure,” it added.“This year has been very tough on us in BC. From Covid, the intense heat in summer, wildfires, and now the flooding. We’ve gone from one disaster to the next, with no time to recuperate,” rues Corduroy. “Hopefully our government will make the right choices for a better future.”“The core threat is that the climate is changing faster than we are able or willing to adapt,” says Donner. “We need to start planning now for the future climate - we need to consider climate change when we design our communities and build our homes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadas-british-columbia-feels-the-effects-of-climate-change-101637843369219.html
25-11-2021||World||Scientists detect new Covid-19 variant in South Africa: Report||Scientists in South Africa have detected a new variant of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) with multiple mutations, news agency AFP reported on Thursday. The development was announced amid a recent surge in infection rate in the country."Unfortunately we have detected a new variant which is a reason for concern in South Africa," virologist Tulio de Oliveira said at an emergency news conference.Earlier today, the World Health Organisation (WHO) officials met to discuss the emergence of a new coronavirus variant – B.1.1529 – circulating in South Africa and neighbouring Botswana.The variant, according to a statement by Francois Balloux, director of the UCL Genetics Institute published in the Science Media Centre, possibly evolved during a chronic infection of an immuno-compromised, likely in an untreated HIV/AIDS patient.As many as 22 cases of the new variant have been reported in South Africa so far, stated the National Institute for Communicable Diseases.Data is limited and scientists are still working to find more about its potential transmissibility. However, a few reports have claimed that the new variant from South Africa could be worse than the Delta variant, which was the cause behind the horrific second wave of pandemic in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scientists-detect-new-covid-19-variant-in-south-africa-report-101637841188500.html
25-11-2021||World||France, UK vow action after deadliest English Channel migrant tragedy||Britain and France were on Thursday looking at new measures to limit migration across the Channel and break people-smuggling networks after at least 27 migrants trying to reach England drowned off the northern French coast.The disaster is the deadliest accident since the Channel in 2018 became a hub for migrants from the Africa, the Middle East and Asia who have been increasingly using small boats to reach England from France.President Emmanuel Macron, after vowing France would not allow the Channel to become a "cemetery", spoke to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson to agree on stepping up efforts to thwart the traffickers blamed for the surge in crossings.Prime Minister Jean Castex also held a crisis meeting on Thursday with ministers to discuss new measures, his office said.Seventeen men, seven women and three minors died when the inflatable boat lost air and took on water off the northern port of Calais on Wednesday, according to public prosecutors in Lille. A manslaughter probe has been opened.The disaster poses a new challenge to cooperation between France and Britain after Brexit. Initial statements from both sides pinning responsibility on the other party to act indicated the tragedy will not be an automatic catalyst for cooperation.Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said a total of five suspected traffickers accused of being directly linked to the doomed crossing had been arrested, the fifth man suspected of buying inflatable boats for the crossing.Darmanin said only two survivors, an Iraqi and Somali, had been found and they were recovering from extreme hypothermia and would eventually be questioned.Calais mayor Natacha Bouchart said a pregnant woman was also one of the victims.Persuading our partnersIn telephone talks, Johnson and Macron agreed on the "urgency of stepping up joint efforts to prevent these deadly crossings" and that "it is vital to keep all options on the table" to break the business model of the smuggling gangs, according to Downing Street.But Johnson told British media London had faced "difficulties persuading some of our partners, particularly the French, to do things in a way that the situation deserves".And in a terse readout of the talks, the Elysee Palace said Macron told Johnson that France and the UK have a "shared responsibility" and added he "expected the British to cooperate fully and refrain from exploiting a dramatic situation for political ends".British officials said Johnson renewed an offer to send police and border forces to France to carry out joint patrols along the Channel coast -- an idea that has been rebuffed by Paris in the past.In a sign of the tensions, Britain's biggest-selling tabloid newspapers all carried a front-page picture of a French police vehicle apparently sitting idly by as migrants entered the waters off northern France.More than 25,700 people have made the cross-Channel journey in small boats this year -- three times the total for the whole of 2020, according to data compiled by Britain's PA news agency.Darmanin insisted that Paris was doing all it could to break the trafficking networks, saying France had arrested 1,500 people smugglers since the start of the year and accusing them of operating like "mafia organisations".He was due to hold new talks with British counterpart Priti Patel later Thursday.No other choiceFrench officials said earlier three helicopters and three boats had searched the area, finding corpses and people unconscious in the water, after a fisherman sounded the alarm.The boat had set off from the coast at Dunkirk before hitting trouble off Calais to the west, a source close to the investigation said.One of the French lifeboat workers, Charles Devos, described seeing "a flat, deflated inflatable boat with the little air that remained helping it float" surrounded by bodies of the drowned.Pierre Roques of the Auberge des Migrants NGO in Calais said the Channel risked becoming as deadly as the Mediterranean, which has seen a much higher toll from migrant crossings."People are dying in the Channel, which is becoming a cemetery. And as England is right opposite, people will continue to cross," he said.A Sudanese man aged 30, Armed, told AFP in Calais after being rescued following a failed attempt to cross that he was aware of the tragedy but it would not stop him trying again."It's terrible, but I'll try it again and again. I have no other choice. I know it is dangerous. I know I'm risking my life. But I have no other choice," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-uk-vow-action-after-deadliest-english-channel-migrant-tragedy-101637838438991.html

Taliban spokesperson for the interior ministry, Qari Saeed Khosty, earlier claimed that the ruling Sunni Pashtun group has finalised a deal with Cpharm for setting up a cannabis processing plant and the work may begin within days.In a series of tweets, Khosty said Taliban officials from the interior ministry’s counter-narcotics department met a representative of a company named Cpharm that wants to set up a cannabis processing plant in Afghanistan. The company needs 30 acres of land to cultivate cannabis and is prepared to invest $430 million in this project to create all cannabis products, he added.“It is worth mentioning that all stages of the contract with the mentioned company have been completed and this project will officially start in the coming days,” Khosty tweeted.The surprise announcement by the Taliban spokesperson left a small Maitland-based company Cpharm inundated with requests for comment. The company clarified that it has nothing to do with the apparent deal with the Taliban, adding that it does not manufacture or supply any products and only provide medical advice to the Australian pharmaceutical industry."We have become aware overnight of numerous media articles stating that Cpharm in Australia has been involved in a deal with the Taliban to be involved in the supply of cannabis in a cream. We have been contacted today by numerous media outlets around the world regarding this," Cpharma said in a statement."We have no connection with cannabis or the Taliban. We have no idea where the Taliban media release has come from and want to assure everyone that it should not be connected to Cpharm Pty Ltd Australia," the company added in a media advisory statement,” the company added.(With inputs from agency)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-signs-deal-with-cpharm-for-cannabis-processing-australian-company-says-no-idea-101637836773317.html

The US stated that these companies were aiding to develop the Chinese military’s quantum computing efforts, according to Reuters.As many as eight China-based technology companies were added in the ‘Entity list’ not only for their alleged role in assisting the Chinese military but also acquiring or attempting to acquire “US-origin items in support of military applications.”In a statement, US commerce secretary Gina Raimondo said the new listings will help prevent the country’s technology from backing the development of Chinese and Russian “military advancement and activities of non-proliferation concern,” including Pakistan's “unsafeguarded nuclear activities or ballistic missile programme.”Also Read | Blacklisted Chinese firms eye lawsuits after Xiaomi win against Trump banChina’s embassy in Washington “firmly” opposed the blacklist move, with spokesperson Liu Pengyu saying that the US uses the “catch-all concept of national security” and “abuses” its power to muzzle and restrain “Chinese enterprises in all possible means.”He added that the US needs to meet China “halfway instead of going further down the wrong path,” the Reuters report revealed.Also Read | US adds Russia, China and 8 others to religious freedom blacklistThis development comes at a time the two nations are at loggerheads with each other over Taiwan’s status and trade issues. Notably, during the recent virtual meeting between US President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, the world leaders discussed trade among several other topics.Meanwhile, the reported eight Chinese companies are not the only ones that have been blacklisted by the US. A total of 27 new entities were added and the list is diverse with inclusions from Pakistan, Japan and Singapore besides China.Names of Chinese firms blacklisted:1.     Hangzhou Zhongke Microelectronics Co Ltd2.     New H3C Semiconductor Technologies Co Ltd3.     Xi'an Aerospace Huaxun Technology4.     Hunan Goke Microelectronics5.     Yunchip Microelectronics6.     Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale7.     QuantumCTek8.     Shanghai QuantumCTeck Co LtdThe US commerce department told Reuters that the blacklist move was aimed at stopping the Chinese military from developing its counter-stealth technology that could include equipment such as advanced radars, and even counter submarine applications like undersea sensors.Suppliers to the firms in the US entity list will require a license before they can sell items, and that is likely to be denied as well.The US has been increasingly and consistently using its ‘Entity list’ to blacklist companies for the sake of foreign policy and national security, and it was started since former President Donald Trump’s administration. In 2019, Chinese telecom firm Huawei was added to the list, cutting them off vital suppliers, thereby making handset production difficult.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/8-chinese-firms-blacklisted-in-us-over-national-security-reasons-101637824312231.html
25-11-2021||World||Libya: Gaddafi's son disqualified from running for president in Dec polls||Libya’s top electoral body on Wednesday disqualified the son and onetime heir apparent of the late dictator Muammar al-Gaddafi from running for president in elections to be held next month, citing his previous convictions.The name of Seif al-Islam Gaddafi appeared on a list of ineligible candidates issued by the country’s High National Elections Committee. He can appeal the decision in court in the coming days.Seif al-Islam had been sentenced to death by a Tripoli court in 2015 for using violence against protesters in a 2011 uprising against his father, but that ruling has since been called into question by Libya’s rival authorities. He is also wanted by the International Criminal Court on charges of crimes against humanity related to the uprising.Libya is set to hold the first round of presidential elections on December 24, after years of UN-led attempts to usher in a more democratic future and end the country’s civil war.Adding to the concerns surrounding the election, the UN’s top envoy for Libya submitted his resignation last week, though he said Wednesday he is prepared to stay on through the vote if needed.Following the 2011 overthrow and killing of Moammar Gaddafi, oil-rich Libya spent most of the last decade split between rival governments — one based in the capital, Tripoli, and the other in the eastern part of the country.Each side in the civil war has also had the support of mercenaries and foreign forces from Turkey, Russia and Syria and other regional powers.The son of Libya’s former dictator submitted his candidacy papers in the southern town of Sabha on November 14.It was the first time in years that the 49-year-old, who earned a PhD at the London School of Economics, appeared in public.He had been captured by fighters in the town of Zintan late in 2011, as the uprising ended his father’s rule after 40 years. Seif al-Islam was released in June 2017.The announcement of his possible candidacy stirred controversy across the divided country, where a number of other high-profile candidates have also emerged in recent weeks. Among them are powerful military commander Khalifa Hifter and the country’s interim prime minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibah.The long-awaited vote still faces challenges, including unresolved issues over laws governing the elections, and occasional infighting among armed groups. Other obstacles include the deep rift that remains between the country’s east and west and the presence of thousands of foreign fighters and troops.Meanwhile, UN envoy Jan Kubis submitted his resignation last week, though it didn’t become public until Tuesday.The Geneva-based diplomat serves as both special envoy for Libya and head of the UN political mission in the country. He told the Security Council on Wednesday that he is leaving to facilitate a change he considers vital: moving the mission chief’s job to Tripoli to be on the ground at a high-stakes moment for Libya.The idea divided the council during discussions in September. Western countries embraced it; Russia rejected it.Kubis added that he was ready to continue as special envoy through the election, though he said the UN had accepted his resignation with a December 10 effective date.Asked about the discrepancy, UN spokesperson Farhan Haq said the organisation would “continue to work with him while we’re seeking a successor.”The job was open for nearly a year before being filled by Kubis, a former Slovak foreign minister and UN official in Iraq and Afghanistan.The Security Council emphasized the importance of the upcoming election Wednesday, urging an “inclusive and consultative electoral process,” warning against violence and disinformation and calling for Libyans to accept the results of the vote.Libyan Ambassador Taher El Sonni said his country appreciates “all international initiatives with genuine intentions,” but he said the council’s members need “to heed us, too” and let Libyans lead their own way out of crisis.“You have a moral responsibility towards the developments in my country over the past 10 years,” he told the group. “Don’t belittle us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/libya-gaddafi-s-son-disqualified-from-running-for-president-in-dec-polls-101637818465633.html

Evie Toombes wants millions in damages from Dr Philip Mitchell.According to Daily Mail, she was born with lipomyelomeningocele (LMM) right after her birth. Also known as spina bifida, the rare condition did not allow her spinal cord did not develop properly in the womb, which caused permanent disability. The showjumping star claims the doctor did not advise her mother Caroline Toombes to take folic acid to avoid the child being 'born in a damaged state', Daily Mail reported.Toombes mother, now 50, became pregnant in 2001 and was advised by Dr Mitchell to take folic acid but was not told of its importance in spina bifida prevention. Caroline said the doctor told her if she was taking a good diet, she would not have to take folic acid.The doctor, however, has denied any liability, claiming he gave Caroline Toombes "reasonable advice".Evie Toombes' lawyer says is Caroline had put off getting pregnant, she would have had a normal, healthy baby.Due to her condition, Evie's mobility is said to be very limited, and she will have to use a wheelchair more and more as she grows older.She now works at Nottingham University and educates children about invisible illnesses. Evie also has her own website.In 2018, she met the Duke of Sussex and Meghan Markle when she won the Inspiration Young Person Award at a charity event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-should-never-have-been-born-woman-with-spina-bifida-sues-doctor-101637816389729.html
25-11-2021||World||Germany's Covid-19 death toll crosses 100,000; infections still spiking||Germany passed the threshold of 100,000 Covid-19 deaths, with the latest wave of the pandemic still pushing new infections higher and hospitals in some hotspots under severe pressure.Since the pandemic took hold at the beginning of last year, 100,119 people have died from the virus, according to the latest data from the RKI public-health institute. The number roughly equals the population of mid-sized German cities like Erlangen or Guetersloh, the home towns of Siemens Healthineers AG and media firm Bertelsmann SE respectively.Germany’s death toll is still lower than in the UK, France or Italy, which each passed 100,000 some time ago. The US has recorded the most deaths with more than 770,000, following by Brazil with over 610,000, according to the Bloomberg Covid-19 Tracker.The number of daily fatalities in Germany is only about a fifth of the level seen last winter, with about 68% of the population fully vaccinated against the disease.Germany’s hospitals are nonetheless becoming increasingly overwhelmed in some regions, and the government’s latest measures have yet to show a tangible effect.Chancellor Angela Merkel and regional leaders agreed last week to restrict access to restaurants, bars and public events for unvaccinated people in hard-hit areas, and the curbs are taking effect across most of the country.With infections climbing further and authorities slow to act amid a change in power, experts warn that another lockdown like in neighboring Austria could become unavoidable, inflicting more damage on Europe’s biggest economy and delaying its recovery.The prospect of tighter restrictions ahead of the Christmas season is “a catastrophe,” according to Marc Tenbieg from lobby group Deutscher Mittelstands-Bund, which represents the small and medium-sized companies that make up the backbone of the German economy.The association backs curbs to fight the pandemic, Tenbieg said, though he criticized political leaders for reacting “far too late.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germanys-covid-19-death-toll-crosses-100-000-infections-still-spiking-101637809565226.html
25-11-2021||World||Pakistan's petroleum dealers to launch nationwide strike today||Petroleum dealers in Pakistan will go on a nationwide strike on Thursday, accusing the Imran Khan-led government of failing to increase the profit margin for the dealers, the Pakistan Petroleum Dealers Association (PPDA) said.Though the PPDA did not mention when the strike will end, the association's chairman Abdul Sami Khan said that it will start at 6am (local time) on Thursday, according to a report by Dawn.Issuing a handout, the PPDA said that a meeting of petroleum dealers was held in Lahore on November 20, where it was pointed out that the Pakistani government would raise the profit margin three years back.The PPDA added that the above promise is still not fulfilled and it has become difficult for dealers to run fuel stations due to growing inflation and an increase in the prices of petroleum products, the Dawn report also said.Previously, the dealers had announced the strike on November 5 but withdrew it after a government delegation held a meeting with them on November 3 to fulfil their demands.The meeting led to the formation of a panel to ensure implementation of the agreement for an increase in profit margin through approval from the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) and the federal cabinet by November 15, Dawn further reported.According to another statement, the government agreed to raise the profit margin by 6% and sought time till November 17 to implement the decision. But the government did not seem serious about this decision, the statement added.Meanwhile, a day before the strike, traffic jams were reported in major cities of Pakistan including Islamabad, Rawalpindi and Karachi. Videos and posts on social media showed long queues at petrol stations in these cities as people hurried to fill fuel in their vehicles.Pakistan's petroleum ministry has assured that vehicle fuel will be available in all major outlets - Pakistan State Oil (PSO), Shell and Total stations across the country. A ministry spokesperson said that a summary to increase the profit margin of petroleum dealers has already been sent to the ECC, the Dawn report said. The ministry is working on increasing the margin and a federal cabinet would take a decision soon.Pakistan's economy is currently grappling with high inflation, current account deficit, historical currency devaluation and dwindling of foreign reserves. Amid the surging economical challenges, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has agreed to revive a stalled $6 billion funding program for Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistans-petroleum-dealers-to-launch-nationwide-strike-today-101637798580806.html
25-11-2021||World||Sweden's first female prime minister resigns hours after appointment||Hours after being tapped as Sweden’s first female prime minister, Magdalena Andersson resigned Wednesday after suffering a budget defeat in parliament and her coalition partner the Greens left the two-party minority government.The government’s own budget proposal was rejected in favor of one presented by the opposition that includes the right-wing populist Sweden Democrats. Sweden’s third-largest party is rooted in a neo-Nazi movement. The vote was 154-143 in favor of the opposition’s budget proposal.Andersson, leader of the Social Democratic party, decided it was best to step down from the post more than seven hours after she made history by becoming the first woman to lead the country.”For me, it is about respect, but I also do not want to lead a government where there may be grounds to question its legitimacy,” Andersson told a news conference.Andersson, who was finance minister before briefly becoming prime minister, informed parliamentary Speaker Andreas Norlen that she is still interested in leading a Social Democratic one-party government.Norlen, the speaker of Sweden’s 349-seat parliament, said he will contact Sweden’s eight party leaders ”to discuss the situation.” On Thursday, he will announce the road ahead.Andersson said that “a coalition government should resign if a party chooses to leave the government. Despite the fact that the parliamentary situation is unchanged, it needs to be tried again."Even though the Green Party pulled its support for her government, it said it is prepared to stand behind Andersson in a new vote to tap a prime minister.But the Greens said it was in the best interests of the party to pull support for her after the budget defeat in parliament.“We have a united party behind us saying we can not sit in government that implements a policy (the Sweden Democrats) negotiated. We must look our voters in the eye and feel pride,” said Marta Stenevi, Green Party spokesperson as the party chose to resign from the government.The other Green Party spokesperson Per Bolund said “that is something we deeply regret.”Earlier in the day, Andersson said she could “govern the country with the opposition’s budget.”The approved budget was based on the government’s own proposal but of the 74 billion kronor ($8.2 billion) that the government wanted to spend on reforms, just over 20 billion kronor ($2.2 billion) will be redistributed next year, Swedish broadcaster SVT said. The approved budget aims at reducing taxes, increased salaries for police officers and more money to different sectors of Sweden’s judiciary system.Andersson's appointment as prime minister had marked a milestone for Sweden, viewed for decades as one of Europe’s most progressive countries when it comes to gender relations, but which had yet to have a woman in the top political post.Andersson had been tapped to replace Stefan Lofven as party leader and prime minister, roles he relinquished earlier this year.Earlier in the day, 117 lawmakers voted yes to Andersson, 174 rejected her appointment while 57 abstained and one lawmaker was absent.Under the Swedish Constitution, prime ministers can be named and govern as long as a parliamentary majority — a minimum of 175 lawmakers — is not against them.Sweden’s next general election is scheduled for Sept. 11.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/swedens-first-female-prime-minister-resings-hours-after-appointment-101637797591070.html

Their retreat to levels nearer those seen before the pandemic only came in 2021, with the release of Covid-19 vaccines.The latest data from the Labor Department brings the closely watched metric of job market health back below where it was on the week of March 14, 2020 before the layoffs began.But analysts were suspicious. Claims decreased by 71,000 from the week prior and hit a level not seen for generations, which Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics attributed to a "seasonal adjustment quirk" that "will substantially reverse next week.""That said, the trend in claims is clearly falling," he wrote in an analysis.- Spending through inflation - Even as the economy has rebounded, Biden has seen his approval ratings fall in recent months, in part due to the spike in inflation.Personal consumption expenditures (PCE) data released by the Commerce Department outlined the extent of last month's increases, with energy prices up 30.2 percent from October 2020 while food prices were 4.8 percent higher.PCE is the preferred inflation gauge of the Federal Reserve, which has pledged to keep its interest rate at zero for longer to maximize employment as the economy recovers.Minutes from the most recent meeting of their policy-setting committee released Wednesday showed some officials worrying the price increases were accelerating, and urged swifter action to end the central bank's stimulus measures.Despite the inflation wave, the government data showed spending exceeded analysts' forecasts with a 1.3 percent gain, while incomes climbed by a more-than-expected 0.5 percent.The latter was due to increasing wages and gains from assets, the data showed, and undercut by the tapering of government benefit payments, likely due to the expiry of pandemic aid programs.Consumers directed their spending towards both goods and services, the report said.Much of the $123.8 billion increase in goods spending went to motor vehicles and parts, while international travel was a component of the $90.5 billion increase in services spending that was felt across sectors.Rubeela Farooqi of High Frequency Economics said the data were a good omen for overall growth in the last quarter of the year, but warned of "some risk from rising infections and broken supply chains that could be disruptive during the holiday season."The economy's recovery this year was dented in the third quarter by the Delta wave of Covid-19 infections, which again snarled businesses.On Wednesday, the Commerce Department revised its GDP growth forecast up slightly to 2.1 percent, annualized, but that remained well below the pace of 6.7 percent in the quarter before.cs/ia||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/respite-for-biden-as-us-layoff-wave-ebbs-spending-ramps-up-101637794452024.html
25-11-2021||World||'No progress' with Iran in nuclear talks: UN agency||The UN nuclear watchdog said Wednesday there had been "no progress" in talks with Tehran on disputes over the monitoring of Iran's atomic programme, just days before talks restart on reviving the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.Rafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), told a quarterly meeting of the agency's board that talks he held in Tehran on Tuesday were "inconclusive" despite being "constructive".Grossi had sought to tackle constraints put on IAEA inspections earlier this year, outstanding questions over the presence of undeclared nuclear material at sites in Iran, and the treatment of IAEA staff in the country."In terms of the substance... we were not able to make progress," Grossi told reporters, saying that the lack of agreement had come "in spite of my best efforts".Behrouz Kamalvandi, spokesman for the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, told Iranian television his team "tried until the last moment" but there is still work to be done.Among other officials in Tehran, Grossi met Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian.Amir-Abdollahian put a positive gloss on the talks, telling the official Irna agency on Wednesday that a "common declaration" had been reached which would be published "as soon as possible".'Foot-dragging'Grossi's visit came ahead of the scheduled resumption on Monday of negotiations between Tehran and world powers aimed at reviving the 2015 deal that gave Iran sanctions relief in return for curbs on its nuclear programme.The United States said it was "disappointed" by the outcome of Grossi's visit and said it was ready to negotiate in Vienna."But of course Iran's failure to cooperate is a bad sign about their seriousness in a successful conclusion to our negotiations," a State Department spokesperson said.The remaining members of the accord -- France, Germany, the UK, China, Russia and Iran -- will attend with the US taking part indirectly.The deal has been gradually disintegrating since former US President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from the deal in 2018.The following year Iran retaliated by starting to move away from its commitments under the deal, also known as the JCPOA.The US negotiator for the JCPOA talks Rob Malley warned that Washington would not "sit idly" if Iran delayed progress at the talks."If (Iran) continues to do what it appears to be doing now, which is to drag its feet at the nuclear diplomatic table and accelerate its pace when it comes to its nuclear program... we'll have to respond accordingly," Malley told US broadcaster NPR.At the IAEA Board of Governors' meeting, the EU issued a joint statement saying it was "deeply concerned at the inconclusive outcome of the discussions" with Grossi.Russia's representative meanwhile said it supported Grossi's "intent to continue working with the Iranian side and call for Tehran to do the same".'Excessively invasive'One of the steps away from the deal came earlier this year when Iran began restricting some IAEA inspections activity.Iran and the agency currently have a temporary agreement that gives the IAEA access to monitoring equipment at Iran's nuclear facilities.However, the Agency has warned that the agreement is not a durable solution and Grossi said he was "close to... the point where I would not be able to guarantee continuity of knowledge" of Iran's nuclear programme if it continued.Grossi also said he had raised concerns while in Tehran about security checks on IAEA inspectors which the agency has described as "excessively invasive".He noted that the IAEA and Iran had a legal agreement "which is intended to protect inspectors from intimidation, from seizure of their property"."Our Iranian colleagues have instituted a number of measures which are simply incompatible" with this, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-progress-with-iran-in-nuclear-talks-un-agency-101637794192876.html

I couldn't believe it.""I always was interested in space as a little girl," she added. "This is a great opportunity for me to feel alive and to just make the greatest adventure ever."Schahaff won the prize after entering a fundraiser sweepstakes organized by Virgin Galactic on the Omaze platform, which raised $1.7 million.The money will be donated to non-government group Space for Humanity, which works for wider access to space.The amount she donated was not made public, but entry started with a minimum contribution of $10.Schahaff, a health and energy coach who works in particular with women, decided to take a shot at the prize after seeing an advertisement on a Virgin Atlantic flight."I just filled out the application, did what was required... not realizing that I would have actually gotten a response to it," she said."I'm very encouraged to inspire others to also live their dream."The drive attracted nearly 165,000 participants in eight weeks, Virgin Galactic said in a statement.'Equal access to space' Wednesday's announcement aimed to show that space tourism is opening up opportunities for a variety of people, despite prices remaining well beyond the reach of most."Being able to give people of all ages and backgrounds equal access to space, and in turn, the opportunity to lead and inspire others back on Earth, is what Virgin Galactic has been building towards for the past two decades," said Branson.The British septuagenarian flew in his company's test mission to space in July, beating by a matter of days Blue Origin owner Jeff Bezos in their billionaire space race.Schahaff will be among the first of Virgin Galactic's space tourists, but her place in the line has yet to be determined, a company spokesperson said.Virgin Galactic has already pre-sold some 700 space tickets: 600 between 2005 and 2014 for up to $250,000 apiece, and another 100 since August, when they were relisted for a price of $450,000.Their aim is to sell 1,000 in total before the launch of commercial flights, the first of which is to take place in late 2022.The proposed trip offers a few minutes in zero gravity. A giant carrier plane takes off from a traditional runway carrying the space vessel, which looks like a large private jet, and then releases it at a high altitude.The space plane then ignites its own rocket engine until it exceeds 50 miles (80 kilometers) above sea level -- the lower limit of space, according to the US military -- before gliding back to the runway.Amazon founder Bezos's company Blue Origin is also offering suborbital flights, but aboard a rocket that takes off from the more traditional vertical position.Blue Origin's third crewed flight is scheduled for early December.Elon Musk's SpaceX meanwhile sent four tourists on a three-day orbital mission around the Earth in September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mom-daughter-bound-for-space-after-winning-virgin-galactic-prize-101637793882058.html

This comes after the government released a report in June, encompassing 144 observations, which said there was a lack of sufficient data to determine the nature of mysterious flying objects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dart-spacecraft-to-kick-an-asteroid-off-course-101637788530212.html
25-11-2021||World||Putin ‘feeling fine’ after taking experimental nasal vaccine||Russian President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday he took an experimental nasal Covid-19 vaccine earlier this week, a day after getting a booster injection of the locally developed Sputnik Light inoculation.The nasal version is still in trials and hasn’t been approved by regulators. Sunday, in a televised appearance announcing he’d taken the injected booster, Putin said he would volunteer to participate in the testing of the nasal vaccine, as well.That option provides better protection in the upper respiratory tract against breakthrough infections than injected versions, Denis Logunov, deputy director of the Gamaleya National Research Center, Sputnik’s developer, told Putin.The Russian president, 69, said Logunov gave him the nasal version Monday. Putin told a government meeting that he’s “feeling fine” after the boosters and had exercised today.Russia claimed to be the first to approve a Covid vaccine in the summer of 2020, but officials and scientists began getting the shots even before Sputnik was registered. Putin, however, got his first two-dose inoculation only in March of this year.Vaccines reduce Delta transmission by 40%’Covid vaccines reduce transmission of the dominant Delta variant by about 40%, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday, warning that people were falling into a false sense of security.The WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus urged vaccinated people to continue to take measures to avoid catching Covid-19 and passing on the disease. He noted that last week, more than 60% of all reported cases and deaths from Covid-19 were once again in Europe.Italy on Wednesday said that unvaccinated people will not be able to enter venues such as cinemas, restaurants and sports events starting from December 6, at least until January 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-feeling-fine-after-taking-experimental-nasal-vaccine-101637788182523.html
25-11-2021||World||China undercounted the number of kids born by nearly 12mn||China undercounted the number of children born in 2000 to 2010 by at least 11.6 million - equivalent to Belgium’s current population - partly because of its stringent one-child policy.The latest statistical yearbook released by the government puts the number of children born during that period at 172.5 million, well above the 160.9 million in that age group recorded in the 2010 census.The difference could be the result of some parents failing to register births to avoid punishment if they breached the one-child policy. China only started allowing all couples to have a second child in 2016, meaning some parents wouldn’t officially report a newborn if they were over the quota until the child turned six and needed to register for school, according to independent demographer He Yafu.About 57% of the children later registered were girls, indicating the discrepancy could be partly linked to parents not reporting girls so they could continue to try for a boy.In addition, the 2010 census was conducted on November 1, 2010, so would have missed births in the last two months of the year. Census surveys also typically don’t include people who have died or emigrated in the intervening years.However, with China now effectively abandoning limits on family size, there could be less of a discrepancy in future.Nevertheless, the number of births is expected to continue declining in China, and the total population could start shrinking as early as this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-undercounted-the-number-of-kids-born-by-nearly-12mn-101637786995242.html

That comes as Germany is seeing a surge in cases, and the political transition has somewhat hampered the country’s response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-parties-reach-deal-for-new-govt-scholz-101637786557554.html
25-11-2021||World||At least 31 dead after migrant boat capsizes in English Channel||At least 31 migrants bound for Britain died Wednesday when their boat sank in the English Channel in the “biggest tragedy” involving migration to have taken place on the dangerous crossing to date, according to France's interior minister.Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said 34 people were believed to have been on the boat. Authorities found 31 bodies and two survivors. One person appeared to still be missing.A joint French-British operation to search for survivors was still under way Wednesday evening.While the incident was the deadliest day in the channel to date, Darmanin noted other deadly incidents in the past and lashed out at “criminal traffickers” driving thousands to risk the crossing.The nationalities of the travelers was not released.Britain's prime minister convened a meeting of the government's crisis committee, and France's interior minister rushed to see survivors in a Calais hospital. The two governments have long been at odds over how to prevent the increasingly dangerous migrant crossings, with both sides blaming the other for not doing enough.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was “shocked, appalled and deeply saddened."A French naval boat spotted several bodies in the water around 2 p.m. and retrieved an unknown number of dead and injured, including some who were unconscious, a maritime authority spokesperson said.Three French patrol boats were joined by a French helicopter and a British helicopter in searching the area, according to the French maritime agency for the region.Jean-Marc Puissesseau, head of the ports of Calais and Boulogne, told The Associated Press that he spoke to one of the rescuers who brought some of the bodies to the Calais port.“Traffickers are assassins,” he said. “We were waiting for something like this to happen.”While deaths are occasionally reported on the crossing, such a large number of people losing their lives in one boat is rare.The victims' nationalities were not immediately released. People fleeing conflict in Afghanistan, Iraq, Eritrea and Sudan have been among those gathered along towns in northern France seeking to cross to Britain.“Strong emotion after the drama of numerous dead in the sinking of a boat of migrants in the channel,” Darmanin tweeted. He slammed migrant smuggling networks that organize such journeys.The Dunkirk prosecutor’s office said it opened an investigation for aggravated manslaughter in the wake of the tragedy.The number of migrants using small boats to cross the channel has grown sharply this year, despite the high risks that are worsening in autumn weather. A number of people are also believed to have reached Britain in small boats on Wednesday.More than 25,700 people have made the dangerous journey in small boats this year — three times the total for the whole of 2020.With changeable weather, cold seas and heavy maritime traffic, the crossing is dangerous for the inflatables and other small boats that men, women and children squeeze into.French and British authorities have picked up thousands of migrants off both the French and British coasts in recent weeks in scores of rescue operations.“How many more times must we see people lose their life trying to reach safety in the UK because of the woeful lack of safe means to do so?" said Tom Davies, Amnesty International U.K.’s refugee and migrant rights campaign manager.“We desperately need a new approach to asylum, including genuine Anglo-French efforts to devise safe asylum routes to avoid such tragedies happening again," he added.Johnson said more needed to be done to “break the business model of the gangsters who are sending people to sea in this way."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/migrant-boat-capsizes-in-english-channel-at-least-31-dead-101637782032860.html
25-11-2021||World||Flush with cash, Saudi Prince snubs Biden and sends a message||President Joe Biden sounded deeply frustrated. Inflation was heading toward a 30-year high and Americans, rich and poor, could see the price of gasoline going up almost daily. Politically, oil was toxic for the White House.'The idea that Russia and Saudi Arabia and other major producers are not going to pump more oil so people can have gasoline to get to and from work, for example, is not right,' Biden said in late October.First in private and later more publicly, American envoys had spent weeks trying to convince the Saudis to pump more crude -- and quickly, according to officials on both sides. The diplomatic pressure was ultimately directed at a 36-year-old man who has the capacity to change the price of oil -- and the fortune of politicians in consuming nations -- on a whim: Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.But the kingdom’s day-to-day ruler didn't budge despite the overtures from American diplomats. Prince Mohammed was more worried about oil’s  supply and demand fundamentals than the political needs of Washington.  But if Biden wanted cheaper gasoline, the prince had his own wish list, including something he hasn’t yet got from the current White House -- access.Since taking office, Biden has only spoken with King Salman, Prince Mohammed’s father, and refused to deal directly with the crown prince, who’s still seen as a pariah in the U.S. after the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018.“There’s a lot of Middle Eastern folks who want to talk to me,” Biden said in October, without directly naming Prince Mohammed. “I’m not sure I’m going to talk to them.”Ultimately, Biden didn't get the extra oil he wanted, forcing him to respond on Tuesday by tapping the country's strategic petroleum reserve -- a decision that risks a further escalation from the Saudi-led OPEC cartel.For Prince Mohammed, sitting atop what’s sometimes described as the central bank of oil, soaring crude prices are giving him the confidence to demand the attention of Biden, and everyone else. The influx of cash also helps his plan to make the kingdom a global investment powerhouse through the $450 billion Public Investment Fund, the sovereign wealth fund which he also chairs and wants to grow to $1 trillion by 2025. In early 2020, Saudi Arabia was staring into the abyss. The pandemic led to a crash in oil prices forcing it to hike taxes and boost its borrowing. Now, just over a year later, oil prices and Saudi crude production are booming, helping restore the kingdom’s finances with a wave of petrodollars, replenishing state coffers, and boosting the prince’s standing at home.“Saudi Arabia is in a strong position,” said Jason Bordoff, dean of the Columbia Climate School and a former senior White House energy official under President Barack Obama. “Oil demand is going up, not down; U.S. shale is not what used to be, and for the foreseeable future the world is going to need more Saudi oil.”In interviews with former and current western and Arab government officials, diplomats, consultants, bankers and oil executives, a picture emerges: Riyadh is coming out of the Covid crisis stronger, both politically and economically. The officials agreed to speak only under condition of anonymity to discuss private interchanges.The Saudi resurgence is linked to the world’s thirst for fossil fuels. Despite the fight against climate change, the world economy is as addicted to oil as it was before the pandemic. Global consumption is now back to about 100 million barrels a day, a level last seen in 2019. Despite the release of strategic reserves on Tuesday, Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, has climbed back above $80 a barrel and Saudi oil production will hit 10 million barrels a day next month, well above pre-Covid levels. If oil prices and Saudi output stay at current levels, the kingdom’s gross oil revenues will top $300 billion in 2022, according to Bloomberg News estimates – putting Riyadh on track to enjoy one of its best ever years. It could be even better. The International Energy Agency believes Saudi oil production may average 10.7 million barrels a day in 2022, the highest ever annual average.Higher oil prices have “strengthened Saudi Arabia’s position both financially and politically,” said David Rundell, a former U.S. diplomat with decades of experience in the kingdom. “Mohammed Bin Salman’s position will become even more secure.”Only a few years ago, the situation was very different.The prince rose to power after his father King Salman was enthroned in January 2015. Initially as Deputy Crown Prince, and since 2017 as Crown Prince, he inherited a sclerotic economy in a financial mess.And America was the reason for lots of the Saudi problems. With the support of Wall Street, the U.S. shale boom had transformed oil’s balance of power. Texas, and not Riyadh, was in the driving seat of the energy market.Months before Prince Mohammed rose to power, oil prices crashed under the weight of booming U.S. production. Brent crude plunged from $115 a barrel in June 2014 to $45 a barrel by the time that he’d followed his father into the royal palace in January 2015, and ultimately less than $30 a barrel by early 2016. Saudi Arabia was bleeding money.Prince Mohammed reacted by cutting spending and launching Vision 2030, a program to restructure the Saudi economy. For a while, Saudi fortunes improved as prices recovered in 2017 and 2018. It helped that Prince Mohammed opened up the formerly closeted economy and removed bans on cinemas and women driving, injecting more of the 21st century into Saudi society. But Khashoggi’s death in October 2018 burst the bubble of optimism. A U.S. intelligence report released by the Biden administration concluded that Prince Mohammed probably ordered the killing, a charge Saudi Arabia denies.After being feted by Western leaders and the heads of some of the world’s biggest firms, Prince Mohammed was quickly dropped. Then, oil prices tanked in early 2020 after Covid first struck China and then the world. Saudi Arabia only survived those bad years by running down its stock of petrodollars and borrowing billions to finance widening fiscal deficits. The reserves fell from a peak of nearly $750 billion in mid-2014 to a low of $437 billion earlier this year. Since, it’s recovered to $465 billion.With oil production and prices rising, the outlook has quickly improved. The royal palace planned for a budget deficit of 140 billion riyals ($37 billion) in 2021, but at the end of the third quarter, the shortfall was a mere 5.4 billion riyals, raising the prospect of balancing the books well ahead of a 2023 target. The Finance Ministry declined to comment on whether it expected to balance the budget this year, as some analysts now expect. “Our economic diversification initiatives are continuing and will be expedited with more resources available,” a spokesman said in a statement. Spending targets and taxation rates won’t change, but any surpluses will either repay debt or get transferred to one of the kingdom’s sovereign wealth funds.The influx of petrodollars will help Prince Mohammed to spend at home handsomely. The government and sovereign wealth fund, which the prince also chairs, have outlined trillions of dollars of spending on everything from vast new cities in the desert to upgrading the kingdom’s creaking infrastructure in a bid to make it a finance, trade and logistics hub for the Middle East.“Higher oil prices are good for the economy, but not in the old way,” said Mazen Al Sudairy, head of research at AlRajhi Capital. In the past, higher oil prices helped the Saudi government fund things like hiring sprees of civil servants to keep unemployment down. Now a surplus is less likely to go into “sticky” spending measures and instead focus on enhancing reserves.In a bid to put the kingdom, and himself, at the center of regional politics, over the past year he’s also patched up a dispute with Qatar and made overtures to arch enemy Iran. In addition to seeking recognition from Biden, the Prince also wants more U.S. help ending the long and expensive war in Yemen. He’d also like more military support to defend itself from drone attacks like the one that knocked out half its oil processing capabilities in 2019.For all the improvement, the Saudi economy is still heavily reliant on oil. Vision 2030 has made so far only modest progress, and critics believe that many of Prince Mohammed’s pet projects, including an entirely new city in the desert called Neom, are white elephants that consume billions of dollars but return little. If the oil market takes a turn for the worse, perhaps because new flare ups of coronavirus cases, Riyadh would be in financial trouble again.For the time being, however, Saudi Arabia appears to be safe. Its oil alliance with Russia looks stronger than ever, putting Riyadh firmly in control of the market, in part thanks to the guidance of Prince Mohammed’s half-brother, Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman. “The Saudis feel they are on the driving seat of the oil market,” says said Helima Croft, commodities strategist at RBC Capital Markets LLC and a former CIA analyst.Over the last few months, OPEC has actually increased output as demand recovers. But Riyadh has made sure the cartel boosted production more slowly than demand recovered, in the process draining global inventories, and lifting prices.Inventories of crude and refined oil product in industrialized countries have fallen now below 2.8 billion barrels, hitting their lowest level since early 2015. “The world oil market remains tight by all measures,” the agency said in November.Still, Biden has continued to refuse to speak to the Crown Prince, widely known as MBS, despite his desire for lower oil prices to bring down inflation. The refusal has continued even after Saudi Arabia announced its most ambitious green target ever, saying it will reach net-zero emissions by 2060.“Whatever the U.S. is offering MBS in return, it is just not enough to persuade him to pump more oil,” said Neil Quilliam, associate fellow in the Middle East and North Africa program at the London-based think tank Chatham House. “The U.S. has to offer something big to get the Saudis to change course - and that must include a bilateral meeting between Biden and MBS.”But Prince Mohammed hasn’t just rebuffed its American ally. Riyadh has argued that OPEC is already adding enough crude into the market, in the process rejecting pleas from China, India and Japan for more oil. President Biden and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, discussed the problem in November during a virtual summit, and agreed to work together to stabilize energy markets.The following week the U.S. was joined by Japan, India, South Korea and the U.K. in a coordinated release of reserves. China is expected to follow suit.Saudi officials paint a different version of the energy landscape. While the oil market is tight today, it will loosen significantly from January onward. They argue higher prices are driven by market fundamentals and the biggest shortage is for natural gas and coal. “Oil is not the problem,” Prince Abdulaziz, the energy minister, said after the last OPEC virtual meeting in November. “The problem is the energy complex is going through havoc and hell.”Prince Abdulaziz will chair an OPEC virtual meeting next week, which will deliver the cartel’s response to Biden’s use of the strategic petroleum reserve. A lot will depend on whether oil keeps rising beyond $80 a barrel, but OPEC can counteract the release by delaying further output hikes.In October, the who’s who of global finance gathered at the Ritz Carlton hotel in Riyadh, granting Prince Mohammed a standing ovation. It was the very same hotel that Saudi authorities turned four years ago into a makeshift prison when it launched what it described as an anti corruption drive that ensnared some of the country’s wealthiest people. The investment summit, which promotes the Saudi wealth fund as a global dealmaker, comes at a time when Riyadh is recycling its newly found oil wealth into trophy assets overseas. The PIF, as the fund is known, recently bought Newcastle United, the British Premier League soccer club. The takeover helps to re-brand the kingdom’s austere image as it aims to attract foreign investment and tourists. Earlier this year it took a stake in supercar maker McLaren and secured a deal to bring Formula 1 to the country.“MBS needs to use today’s bonanza to secure Saudi Arabia’s economic future by moving as fast as possible into non-oil economic sectors,” said Jim Krane, research fellow at Rice University’s Baker Institute. “When the oil rents pour in, it’s easy to buy extra political support,” making the investments the kingdom needs to make to get ahead of “a damaging energy transition,” Krane said.Surviving that transition “is going to be the Saudi mantra,” he said. “High oil prices are just the ticket to get this process rolling.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/flush-with-cash-saudi-prince-snubs-biden-and-sends-a-message-101637760596116.html
25-11-2021||World||700,000 more could die in Europe: WHO on Covid-19||Europe remains “in the firm grip” of Covid and the death toll on the continent could top 2.2mn this winter if current trends continue, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday.Some 700,000 could die in the coming months, the WHO said, as cases creep up across Europe, prompting some countries to reimpose tough restrictions.The WHO expects “high or extreme stress in intensive care units (ICUs) in 49 out of 53 countries between now and March 1, 2022”. “Cumulative reported deaths are projected to reach over 2.2mn by spring next year,” it added, up from the current 1.5mn. According to WHO data, Covid-related deaths increased last week to nearly 4,200 a day, doubling from 2,100 deaths a day at the end of September.The WHO also said evidence was growing that vaccine-induced protection against infection and mild disease was declining. “The Covid-19 situation across Europe and Central Asia is very serious. We face a challenging winter ahead,” regional director for WHO Europe, Hans Kluge, said in a statement.He called for a “vaccine plus” approach, consisting of vaccinations, social distancing, the use of face masks and hand washing.Call for more Covid-19 restrictions in GermanyGermany’s health minister called on Tuesday for further restrictions to contain a “dramatic” surge in coronavirus cases as the country’s infection rate hit a record high and the US advised against travel there.The seven-day incidence rate - the number of people per 100,000 to be infected over the last week - hit 399.8 on Tuesday, up from 386.5 on Monday, data from the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases showed.Health minister Jens Spahn called for more public spaces to be restricted to those who were vaccinated or recently recovered from Covid-19 and also had a negative test, in a bid to contain Germany’s fourth wave.Spahn did not rule out lockdowns, although he said this would be decided region by region. Some regions such as the hard-hit Saxony and Bavaria are already taking measures such as cancelling Christmas markets.“The situation is not only serious, in some regions in Germany it is now dramatic,” Spahn told German Radio. “We are having to move patients around as the intensive care units are full and that doesn’t just affect Covid-19 patients.”The surge in cases in Germany, and in neighbouring Denmark, prompted the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Monday to advise against travel to the two countries, raising its travel recommendation to “Level Four: Very High”.The Netherlands on Tuesday started transporting Covid patients across the border to Germany to ease pressure on Dutch hospitals struggling to deal with a surge in coronavirus cases. The number of patients in Dutch hospitals has swelled to its highest level since May in recent weeks .French PM tests positiveFrench Prime Minister Jean Castex tested positive for Covid-19 and will be isolating for 10 days, his office said in a statement.Although France has not put new restrictions in place like Austria and Germany, the latest wave is hitting the country “at a blazing speed”, government spokesman Gabriel Attal said on Sunday.President Emmanuel Macron’s government is reinforcing healthpass checks in enclosed areas and this week will discuss opening up its booster-shot campaign to more adults, he said. In Belgium, Prime Minister Alexander De Croo and several other ministers went into quarantine on Monday after meeting with French PM Castex earlier in the day.The Czech Republic may make Covid-19 vaccines mandatory for people over the age of 60 as well as for some professions including health and social care workers, under plans now being drawn up, Prime Minister Andrej Babis said on Tuesday.Austria on Monday went into a new lockdown while Slovakia’s leaders have proposed a national lockdown as hospitals across the European Union country are hitting their limits amid a record surge of coronavirus infections.The European Medicines Agency said it has received a request from Merck to authorise its coronavirus antiviral, the first pill shown to treat Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/700000-more-could-die-in-europe-who-on-covid19-101637706577111.html

She was 56.Shabazz was found Monday in her home in Brooklyn, a police spokesperson said. Her death appeared to be from natural causes, he said.Malikah and her twin sister, Malaak, were the youngest daughters of Malcolm X, who was assassinated on February 21, 1965. Their mother, Betty Shabazz, was pregnant with the twins when their father was killed.Shabazz and her daughter, Bettih Shabazz, were arrested in Maryland in 2017 on animal cruelty charges after authorities said several injured dogs were found inside a stolen U-Haul truck they were driving.Malikah Shabazz's death comes days after two of the three men who had been convicted of killing Malcolm X were exonerated.A Manhattan judge dismissed the convictions of Muhammad Aziz and the late Khalil Islam after prosecutors and the men's lawyers said a renewed investigation found new evidence that undermined the case against them.Bernice King, a daughter of Martin Luther King Jr., said on Twitter, “I'm deeply saddened by the death of #MalikahShabazz. My heart goes out to her family, the descendants of Dr. Betty Shabazz and Malcolm X.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/malikah-shabazz-a-daughter-of-slain-civil-rights-leader-malcolm-x-dies-at-56-101637677305127.html
25-11-2021||World||Stop ‘politicisation’ of tennis star Peng Shuai’s situation: China||The Chinese foreign ministry on Tuesday said it hoped that “malicious hype” about tennis star Peng Shuai’s whereabouts and well-being would stop and that her case would not be politicised.In its first reaction in the case, ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian said “certain people” should stop the “malicious hype” and “politicisation” of the issue of tennis star Peng, as global scrutiny led by foreign governments and sports and rights organisations continue to raise questions around her well-being.The whereabouts of Peng, a former doubles world number one and one of China’s top tennis icons, have been a matter of international concern since November 2 when she posted a message on social media alleging that China’s former vice-premier Zhang Gaoli had sexually assaulted her. Peng’s post was immediately deleted and her presence scrubbed from China’s strictly censored web.The Chinese foreign ministry had until now refused to comment on the case, saying it wasn’t a diplomatic issue.Zhao on Tuesday responded for the first time, dismissing international concern over Peng’s whereabouts as hype and politics.“I believe everyone has also seen her attend some public events recently as well as the video call with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) President (Thomas) Bach,” Zhao said at the regular ministry briefing on Tuesday.When asked whether the tennis player’s case would negatively affect China’s image, Zhao said, “I think some people should stop the malicious hype and not politicise this issue”.Earlier this week, International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach spoke with Peng via video call, her first direct contact with sports officials outside China since November 2.The Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) and Amnesty International said the call did not alleviate fears around Peng’s safety.“This video does not change our call for a full, fair and transparent investigation, without censorship, into her allegation of sexual assault, which is the issue that gave rise to our initial concern,” the WTA said.“The IOC is entering dangerous waters. They should be extremely careful not to participate in any whitewash of possible human rights violations,” said Amnesty’s China researcher Alkan Akad.“In the past we have seen various similar cases where people had no option but to say what they had been told to,” he said.“The Chinese government has a track record, especially the state run media outlets of fabricating statements or making people give forced and sometimes televised testimonies shortly after people go missing,” said Akad.On Sunday, Chinese state media released a video and photos of Peng at a youth tournament in Beijing.The footage was released by Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of state-run newspaper the Global Times, who said on Twitter that the video was shot on Sunday.Peng was shown standing beside a court and then waving and signing oversize commemorative tennis balls for children.“While it is positive to see her, it remains unclear if she is free and able to make decisions and take actions on her own, without coercion or external interference,” Steve Simon, WTA chief, said in response to the footage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/stop-politicisation-of-tennis-star-peng-shuai-s-situation-china-101637672999495.html

Officials at the prime minister's headquarters did not comment on whether Castex has any virus symptoms.One of Castex's daughters tested positive Monday after her father returned from a meeting with Belgian Prime Minister Alexander de Croo in Brussels, and Castex himself then took two tests that were both positive, his office said.De Croo's office said he will be tested Tuesday and will self-isolate while awaiting the result, according to Belgian state broadcaster RTBF.While 75% of France's population is vaccinated, the number of virus infections has risen quickly in recent weeks. Hospitalizations and deaths linked to the virus are also rising in France, though are so far well below the crisis levels of earlier surges.French President Emmanuel Macron contracted Covid-19 last December, and other government ministers have also had the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-pm-castex-tests-positive-for-covid-19-after-returning-from-belgium-101637625247308.html

25-11-2021||World||First known Covid case may have been a Wuhan market vendor: Study||The first identified Covid-19 case was a vendor at a seafood market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan and not, as thought earlier, an accountant without any link to the market, a new study published in the journal Science, said on Thursday.The origins of the Sars-CoV-2 virus, which causes Covid-19 remains a mystery, and a major source of tension between China and several western countries.The identification of the accountant as the first patient with Covid-19 symptoms had added to the speculation that the virus could have leaked from a virus laboratory located across the Yangtze river from the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, the first pandemic epicentre.Beijing has consistently denied the lab leak theory, and claiming instead that cases of the viral fever had been diagnosed in other countries before Wuhan. The new study adds to the voices suggesting that the virus may have emerged from an animal. It says that the World Health Organization and China inquiry into the origins had got the initial chronology of the outbreak wrong.According to virologist Michael Worobey, rather than the original patient being a man who had never been to the Wuhan market, the first known case of Covid-19 turns out to be a woman, a vendor at the market.“His (the accountant’s) symptom onset came after multiple cases in workers at Huanan market, making a female seafood vendor there the earliest known case, with illness onset on December 11,” said Worobey, who is head of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Arizona.“Given the high transmissibility of Sars-CoV-2 and the high rate of asymptomatic spread, many symptomatic cases would inevitably soon lack a direct link to the location of the pandemic’s origin,” he wrote. The virologist went through publicly available data including hospital records and interviews of patients to arrive at this conclusion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-known-covid-case-may-have-been-a-wuhan-market-vendor-study-101637357286125.html
25-11-2021||World||Kenosha shootings: Kyle Rittenhouse, teenager who shot 2, cleared of all charges||Kyle Rittenhouse was acquitted of all charges Friday after pleading self-defense in the deadly Kenosha shootings that became a flashpoint in the debate over guns, vigilantism and racial injustice in the U.S.Rittenhouse, 18, began to choke up, fell to the floor and then hugged one of his attorneys upon hearing the verdict.He had been charged with homicide, attempted homicide and reckless endangering after killing two men and wounding a third with an AR-style semi-automatic rifle during a tumultuous night of protests over police violence against Black people in the summer of 2020. The former police youth cadet is white, as were those he shot.The jury, which appeared to be overwhelmingly white, deliberated for close to 3 1/2 days.Rittenhouse could have gotten life in prison if found guilty on the most serious charge, first-degree intentional homicide, or what some other states call first-degree murder.As he dismissed the jurors, Circuit Judge Bruce Schroeder assured them the court would take “every measure” to keep them safe.A sheriff’s deputy immediately whisked Rittenhouse out a back door through the judge’s chambers.In reaction to the verdict, prosecutor Thomas Binger said the jury had spoken.Rittenhouse's mother, sitting several feet away from him on a courtroom bench, gasped in delight and began crying as the clerk read out the string of five not-guilty verdicts, hugging others around her.Wisconsin Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, who is Black and a Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate, denounced the outcome.“Over the last few weeks, many dreaded the outcome we just witnessed," Barnes said. "The presumption of innocence until proven guilty is what we should expect from our judicial system, but that standard is not always applied equally. We have seen so many black and brown youth killed, only to be put on trial posthumously, while the innocence of Kyle Rittenhouse was virtually demanded by the judge.”Political figures on the right, meanwhile, welcomed the verdict and condemned the case brought against Rittenhouse.“All of us who knew what actually happened in Kenosha last year assumed this would be the verdict,” tweeted Republican former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. “Thankfully, the jury thought the same.”As the outcome drew near, Gov. Tony Evers pleaded for calm and said 500 National Guard members would be ready for duty in Kenosha if needed.Rittenhouse was 17 when he went from his home in Antioch, Illinois, to Kenosha after businesses in the city were ransacked and burned over the shooting of a Black man, Jacob Blake, by a white police officer.Carrying a weapon that authorities said was illegally purchased for the underage Rittenhouse, he joined other armed citizens in what he said was an effort to protect property and provide medical aid.Bystander and drone video captured most of the frenzied chain of events that followed: Rittenhouse killed Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, then shot to death protester Anthony Huber, 26, and wounded demonstrator Gaige Grosskreutz, now 28.Prosecutors portrayed Rittenhouse as a “wannabe soldier” who had gone looking for trouble that night and was responsible for creating a dangerous situation in the first place by pointing his rifle at demonstrators.But Rittenhouse testified: “I didn’t do anything wrong. I defended myself.”Breaking into sobs at one point, he told the jury he opened fire after Rosenbaum chased him and made a grab for his gun. He said he was afraid his rifle was going to be wrested away and used to kill him.Huber was then killed after hitting Rittenhouse in the head or neck with a skateboard, and Grosskreutz was shot after pointing a gun of his own at Rittenhouse.The case was part of an extraordinary confluence of trials that reflected the deep divide over race in the United States: In Georgia, three white men are on trial in the killing of Ahmaud Arbery, while in Virginia, a trial is underway in a lawsuit over the deadly white-supremacist rally held in Charlottesville in 2017.The exact racial makeup of the Rittenhouse jury wasn’t clear because jurors were not asked about their race in court.The bloodshed in Kenosha took place during a summer of sometimes-violent protests set off across the U.S. by the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis and other cases involving the police use of force against Black people.While some Americans condemned Rittenhouse as a vigilante, some on the right hailed him as a hero who exercised his Second Amendment gun rights and tried to put a stop to lawlessness.Then-President Donald Trump said it appeared Rittenhouse had been “very violently attacked.” Supporters donated more than $2 million toward his legal defense.Rittenhouse had also been charged with possession of a dangerous weapon by a person under 18, a misdemeanor that had appeared likely to lead to a conviction. But the judge threw out that charge before jury deliberations after the defense argued that the Wisconsin law did not apply to the long-barreled rifle used by Rittenhouse.Schroeder’s handling of the trial drew attention at several points, including when he led applause for military veterans on Veterans Day just before a defense witness who had been in the Army was about to take the stand. The judge also let Rittenhouse himself draw juror numbers from a raffle drum to set the final 12 who deliberated.Video and testimony from some of the prosecution’s own witnesses seemed to buttress Rittenhouse’s claim of self-defense.Witnesses described Rosenbaum as “hyperaggressive” and said that he dared others to shoot him and threatened to kill Rittenhouse earlier that night. A videographer testified Rosenbaum lunged for the rifle just before he was shot, and a pathologist said his injuries appeared to indicate his hand was over the barrel.Also, Rosenbaum’s fiancee disclosed that he was on medication for bipolar disorder and depression. Rittenhouse’s lawyers branded Rosenbaum a “crazy person.”Some civil rights activists saw a racial double standard in the way the white gunman was treated.On the night of the shootings, law enforcement officers saw Rittenhouse and other armed people on the streets despite a curfew and gave them bottles of water, with one officer heard saying over a loudspeaker, “We appreciate you guys.”Later, amid the tumult, Rittenhouse managed to get past a police line with his weapon slung over his shoulder and was not arrested that night.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kenosha-shootings-kyle-rittenhouse-teenager-who-shot-2-cleared-of-all-charges-101637346378259.html
25-11-2021||World||Kamala Harris becomes first female acting president of the US||Vice-President Kamala Harris on Friday became the first female acting president of the United States after President Joe Biden temporarily transferred his presidential powers to her before going for an annual medical check-up, which involves possible sedation.Harris is the first woman to hold presidential powers. Though temporary and notional, this will be yet another first for Harris who already has a bagful of them. She was the first woman vice-president, and as the daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants, she was also the first African American vice-president, first Asian American vice-president, and the first Indian American to hold the country’s second-most powerful position.The White House press office has confirmed that President Joe Biden is using Section 3 of the 25th Amendment to temporarily transfer power.The 25th Amendment, which was enacted in the aftermath of president John F Kennedy’s assassination, lays down the process by which a president or vice-president can be replaced in the event of death, removal, resignation, or incapacitation.“Whenever the President transmits to the President pro-tempore of the Senate (the vice-president) and the Speaker of the House of Representatives his written declaration that he is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, and until he transmits to them a written declaration to the contrary, such powers and duties shall be discharged by the Vice President as Acting President,” the section says.Biden will take back his powers through a similar declaration.US presidents have handed over their powers before, under the 25th Amendment, ahead of a medical procedure such as a colonoscopy, which is conducted for colon cancer screening. Most people feel more comfortable going through the procedure under sedation, which is optional.Former President Donald Trump was an exception. He refused to be sedated for his colonoscopy in 2019, according to a new book by his then press secretary Stephanie Grisham, which means he did not have to transfer his presidential powers to then vice-president Mike Pence.Trump’s procedure was conducted at the Walter Reed military hospital and his visit was kept a secret. Grisham says Trump was embarrassed about the procedure. “I think the president was embarrassed by the procedure, even though President George W Bush had the same one done when he was in office and had been very transparent about it,” she wrote.Bush underwent colonoscopy twice — in 2002 and 2007 — and on both occasions he transferred his powers to then vice--president Dick Cheney for a couple of hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-becomes-first-female-acting-president-of-the-us-101637342951122.html
25-11-2021||India||Time to invest in NE, boost growth: Amit Shah at ICC meet||New Delhi: Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday called upon businesses to invest in the country’s northeast and boost development in the region that was witnessing peace and political stability for the first time. He said that in just seven years, the Union government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has created an atmosphere in the northeast that is ideal for investments. Shah made the appeal while virtually addressing a session themed “Bharat at 75: Empowering Northeast India” at the annual general meeting of the Indian Chamber of Commerce (ICC). He urged ICC to look at the positive change in the region and set up a chapter there. “I would like to tell the ICC that everything required for investments is now there in the northeast. It is time to invest in the region, empower it and boost its development,” Shah said. “There was a time when there were problems like violence, extremism, disputes, floods, corruption and drugs. Manipur was known only for bandhs, blockades and strikes. Assam was known only for terrorism and conflicts between ethnic groups. But today the North East remains in the news for increasing connectivity, development, tourism, employment, electricity and forests as well as ending floods. If industrial investment is to be made in any region, then it is very important to have peace, end disputes, create an environment of political stability and create a good environment for economic development. The task of creating such an environment has been done by the Narendra Modi government in the last 7 years. Today the North East is ready to be a big contributor to the development of the country,” he added. Shah further said that the connectivity problem in the northeast was being resolved by signing a land border agreement with Bangladesh. “The northeast will be connected to the ports of Bangladesh in two years and this will open up a huge avenue for setting up industry in the northeast and for connectivity to the rest of the world.” Shah pointed out that the government was focusing on a new approach in its development boost in the region that revolved around “three Es” — empathy, empowerment and enabler. The home minister said PM Modi’s target of turning India into a $5 trillion economy in the coming years could not be possible if the northeast region is not developed properly. “The northeast is very important for us and we have to connect it with the rest of the country in all sense,” Shah said. “The Modi government has focused on the northeast region since it came to power. Today, the region is ready to play the role of contributor in the development of the country,” he added. Talking about development initiates taken by the Modi government during its seven years, Shah said the northeast is clearly the main focus for the PM, who has made at least 50 trips to the region since coming to the power in 2014. “Today, there is rail and road connectivity to every capital city in northeastern states. Tourism is booming and national highways have been built in all the states. All governments in the northeast are now working in majority and peacefully. Conflicts have been resolved and insurgency is finished,” said Shah. The minister said that in the last seven years, the government has identified four major objectives for the northeast region. First, to end the instability by establishing political stability; secondly, to end all the disputes in the northeast and turn it into a peaceful area; third, to preserve its dialects, languages, dance, music, food and, culture, and to create an attraction for it in the world; and fourth, to make the northeast a developed region and make efforts to bring the northeast’s contribution to the GDP back to the level before independence. He said that before 2014, about 385 civilians were killed in the northeast every year in incidents of violence from 2007 to 2014 and now from 2019 to 2021, an average of two civilians have died.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/time-to-invest-in-ne-boost-growth-amit-shah-at-iccmeet-101637864614076.html

All Members of BJP in Rajya Sabha are, therefore, requested to be positively present in the House throughout the day on Monday, the 29 November 2021 and support the Government’s stand,” the notice issued on Thursday. A party functionary, on condition of anonymity, said the presence of the MPs is also required to prevent the opposition from disrupting the House on the first day of the meet.Last week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced that his government has decided to repeal the three farm laws against which the farmers have been protesting for more than a year. On Wednesday, the Union Cabinet approved the Farm Laws Repeal Bill, 2021, to be taken up in the upcoming Parliament session to roll back the laws.The passage of the bills during the Monsoon Session of Parliament last year witnessed strong protests in both Houses and suspension of several opposition leaders for creating ruckus, tearing documents, breaking microphones and jostling with the ward staff.In the last session, at least two security staff complained about getting injured when they tried to restrain the opposition MPs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-issues-whip-to-rajya-sabha-mps-tells-them-to-attend-day-1-of-winter-session-101637863833029.html
25-11-2021||India||National security comes before privacy, says data protection panel chief||Privacy cannot supersede national security, sovereignty, and integrity, PP Chaudhary, the head of the joint parliamentary committee (JPC) that reviewed the proposed data protection law and finalised its report on Monday said, days after the panel’s opposition party members argued the new bill gives the government “unbridled power”. At least five members of the panel have submitted dissent notes.The JPC has suggested stricter compliance requirements for companies; added or tweaked clauses that provide for lighter obligations on government agencies; and recommended a greater say for the state in the legal mechanism that will be set up to safeguard personal and non-personal data.“Sufficient safeguards have been provided in the bill to ensure that data is only accessed through a fair and proportionate procedure,” Chaudhary, a Bharatiya Janata Party member of parliament representing Pali in Rajasthan (CHECK) said in an interview. He added that the only exemptions are the ones already provided for in the Constitution while referring to the contentious Clause 35 of the bill, which deals with exemptions for government agencies.The panel has recommended that the procedure by which this exemption is claimed be “just, fair, reasonable and proportionate”. The clause allows the government to claim the exemption if it is satisfied that it is “necessary or expedient” to do so in the interest of purposes such as national security . The tests for just, fair and proportionate have been explained further as part of the procedure.Chaudhary said the procedures built into the bill provide for a framework even more detailed than the Constitution. “We have removed the provisions of public order and morality from the clause. But one must understand that national security cannot be compromised in lieu of individual privacy,” he said. “When the central government is satisfied that is necessary and expedient, it may grant exemptions, say to the army or to Intelligence Agencies, but under only the conditions provided for.”Chaudhary referred to Clause 12, which empowers the government to access data without consent. He added the intent of the bill is clear and that such action should only be taken in exceptional cases when it is required to provide benefits and services. “Is the government using data to provide ration through the public distribution system or provide funds under the MGNREGS (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme) not beneficial to people?” he asked. “We need to understand the limitation of people’s ability to provide consent. How can we obtain consent from the poor when the data is being processed centrally?”Chaudhary said consent is paramount, but the aim is to prevent misuse of data and not hinder its use for beneficial schemes. “If a service is being provided, then consent is not necessarily required,” he said defending section 12 of the new bill. The panel’s report will be tabled in Parliament during the Winter Session beginning November 29 for discussion, following which the government will re-introduce the bill, with amendments if needed as the recommendations are not binding.The BJP MP highlighted that the inclusion of non-personal in the bill was done since one cannot segregate personal data from non-personal. “If the ministry needs to mine data for the growth of the digital economy, it becomes important that provisions for the same are provided,” Chaudhary said. “Non-personal and anonymized data can’t be separated from personal data. There are many overlaps.”Referring to the provision to treat social media companies as publishers, he added that the panel made a recommendation based on its deliberations. “The government will have the ability to frame detailed rules and provisions under the bill in order to bring about the change. There will be a transition period of nearly 24 months wherein the requisite infrastructure will be created. That is reasonable amount time to make the change.” Chaudhary attacked the opposition parties for opposing the bill and said their opposition is driven by an ideology of dissent. “We have to strike a fine balance,” he added. “Parliament will enact the law, so it can look into it whenever it wants but to have it evaluate it on a day-to-day basis is untenable. The IT (information technology) parliamentary committee can also take it up and provide further recommendations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/national-security-comes-before-privacy-says-data-protection-panel-chief-101637863651248.html
25-11-2021||India||Navjot Sidhu’s threat to Punjab govt: Will fast over drugs, sacrilege cases||Moga Punjab Congress chief Navjot Sidhu on Thursday threatened his own government that he will fast unto death if the report of the special task force (STF) on the drug issue is not opened and justice is not delivered in sacrilege cases.Miffed over the delay in opening of the report, Sidhu upped the ante on the drug issue which is slated to come up in the high court on December 6. Contrary to chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi’s stand that the report is a court document, Sidhu said there is nothing stopping the government from making the report public and taking action against those named therein.Sidhu was addressing a rally at a grain market in Baghapurana town.Sidhu said, “Lakhs of mothers were devastated. Lakhs of youth died by taking injections of drugs. Today I am saying to you, if the Punjab government does not open this report, I will fast unto death.”“Open this report to find out why the former CM and home minister slept on it. Court is saying to open the report. Why is the report not being opened? Who is stopping you from opening the report. Open the report and put the culprits behind bars. I am the party president. I have no administrative powers. CM Channi said that he follows the instructions of the party. Therefore, I am saying that if the report is not opened, I will fast unto death,” said Sidhu.He also attacked his government on the sacrilege issue.“I am again demanding justice for the sacrilege of my Guru (Guru Granth Sahib). One government has gone, the other one has been formed. One chief minister has gone and another one has taken over the office. And I am saying if justice on sacrilege is not given, I will sacrifice my body. Mark my words.“Those who did (sacrilege) are roaming freely. What kind of government it is if culprits are not brought to justice and it cannot take a step forward to bring justice?” he asked.Channi left the venue a few minutes before Sidhu’s address. The chief minister announced the setting up of a nursing college in Baghapurana along with constructing a stadium in the name of Shaheed Bhagat Singh. He also announced the upgrading of two existing hospitals in Baghapurana along with grants for a Guru Nanak College and Sports Academy. Sidhu said, “Four years ago such promises were also made by the then CM. But these were not fulfilled because the state government has no money. I will bring ₹2,000 crore into the state exchequer from sand mining and ₹20,000 crore from liquor. I will not form a government by lying.”Meanwhile, AAP MLA from Raikot Jagtar Singh Jagga joined the Congress party. Both CM Channi and Sidhu welcomed him into the party fold.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/navjot-sidhu-s-threat-to-punjab-govt-will-fast-over-drugs-sacrilege-cases-101637863412480.html

The heavy downpour inundated railway stations and the famous Arulmigu Subramaniya Swamy Temple in Tiruchendur in Thoothukudi. Schools and colleges which were closed in the district will continue to be shut on November 26 as well, said Thoothukudi’s collector K Senthilraj. In Thoothukudi, nearly 500 people who were living along low lying areas were evacuated and moved to state-run relief camps. Train services to and from Thoothukudi were cancelled. Significant rainfall on Thursday from 8.30 am up to 5.30 pm was recorded in Thiruchendur – 18 cm, Thoothukudi port – 25 cm and Palayamkottai- 10 cm. Heavy rain also lashed Chennai since late evening.

The excessive rainfall has caused havoc across the state including in Chennai since the first week of November. A six-member central team concluded a four-day visit to Tamil Nadu on Wednesday to assess rain-related damages as the state has sought central aid to the tune of ₹4,000 crore for restoration work. For November 26, the Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) has forecast heavy to very heavy rain at isolated places over Kanyakumari, Tirunelveli and Tenkasi districts. Heavy rain has been predicted at isolated places over Thoothukudi, Cuddalore, Villupuram, Chengalpattu, Chennai, Kancheepuram, Tiruvallur, Theni, Madurai, Pudukkottai and the Union Territory of Puducherry. “A fresh low pressure area is likely to form over south Andaman Sea around November 29.

25-11-2021||India||Four months after violent border clashes, Assam and Mizoram CMs meet in Delhi||Four months after clashes between security forces on the interstate border claimed the lives of 6 Assam policemen, the chief ministers of Assam and Mizoram met in New Delhi on Thursday to discuss the contentious boundary dispute between the two neighbouring states. Himanta Biswa Sarma and his Mizoram counterpart Zoramthanga held discussions late on Thursday evening on the insistence of Union home minister Amit Shah who urged both leaders to try and sort out the boundary dispute through talks. “Cordial discussions on various developmental topics for the welfare of northeast India were discussed. Looking forward to many more progressive meetings,” Zoramthanga tweeted after the discussions. The meeting, which took place at the Assam House in Delhi, was also attended by Assam agriculture minister Atul Bora, who is the president of Asom Gana Parishad, a partner in the BJP-led coalition in the state. No immediate reaction was available from either Assam or Mizoram on details of the meeting. Assam and Mizoram share a 164.6 km long inter-state border and there has been a long-standing dispute between the two states. On Mizoram’s side the border districts are Aizawl, Kolasib and Mamit, while on Assam’s side, the border sharing districts are Cachar, Hailakandi and Karimganj. After the firing between the police of both the states at Cachar’s Lailapur on July 26 this year, there were several rounds of talks between both states under the Central government’s intervention. On August 5, following a ministerial-level meeting between the two states at Aizawl, Assam and Mizoram declared that the disputed areas will be looked after by neutral forces from central security agencies. But even after the agreement to maintain status quo on the disputed border there were allegations and counter-allegations from both sides about constructions going on along the boundary. On November 5, the Union home ministry issued advisories to both states to maintain status quo on the disputed areas along the inter-state border. But stating that Assam hasn’t stopped construction, Mizoram asked officials in the border districts of the state to continue with ongoing work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/four-months-after-violent-border-clashes-assam-and-mizoram-cms-meet-in-delhi-101637861490761.html
25-11-2021||India||What is Delhi's Peace and Harmony Committee which has summoned Kangana Ranaut?||Bollywood actor Kangana Ranaut has been summoned by Delhi Assembly's Peace and Harmony Committee on December 6 over her recent Instagram posts that the actor tweeted after PM Modi announced the decision of repealing the three contentious farm laws. This committee is headed by AAP MLA Raghav Chadha. Recently this committee summoned a Facebook India executive and grilled him for the social media's alleged role in failing to curb the hateful content that led to the riots in the Capital in 2020.What is the committee all about? The Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of NCT of Delhi had constituted the committee in 2020 March. The object of the committee is to recommend suitable measures to restore harmony among religious communities, social groups etc. When teh committee was formed, it was reported that a fact-checking agency would be hired to assist the committee in checking the authenticity of the content. The committee also has the assistance of a team of lawyers and a team of IT experts. The power of the committee is not uncontested as Facebook had moved the Supreme Court challenging the summons of the committee. In its verdict this year, the Supreme Court said the committee has the power to compel the attendance of members and outsiders on grounds of its privilege. “Although law and order and police do not fall under the legislative domain of Delhi Assembly, in the larger context, the concept of peace and harmony goes much beyond that," the Supreme Court said.How is Kangana's case related to this committee? In the notice sent to the actor, the committee said that it has received numerous complaints against the Instagram post of Kangana where the actor labelled the Sikh community as 'Khalistani terrorists'. The comments have caused distress among the people from the Sikh community, thus potentially leading to a situation of disruption of peace and harmony in the NCT of Delhi, the notice said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-is-delhi-s-peace-and-harmony-committee-which-has-summoned-kangana-ranaut-101637859880436.html

In an apparent reference to Owaisi, Tikait warned a farmers’ gathering in Hyderabad about an “unbridled bull” who “helps BJP the most”. He asked the farmers to tie down the “bull” in Hyderabad and don’t let him out of Telangana."You have an unbridled bull here who's helping BJP. Tie him down here itself. He helps BJP the most. Don't let him out of here. He says something else but has some other goal. Don't let him go out of Hyderabad & Telangana," Tikait said.Tikait has emerged as one of the prominent faces of the year-long farmers’ protest that forced the Central government to take back the three controversial farm laws. The BKU spokesperson, however, has also been critical of Owaisi’s role as AIMIM seeks to expand its base in Uttar Pradesh. The AIMIM chief’s ambition to emerge as an alternative for Muslim voters outside Telangana is often criticised by detractors as a move to help the BJP by damaging the prospects of regional parties.Taking about Owaisi’s plan in the upcoming Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls, Tikait said, "If he goes there, he will help the BJP. The whole country knows this. Keep him tied. He is an unbridled bull...He is both the A and B team (of BJP). All the people of the country know.”Tikait recently termed BJP-AIMIM dynamics as 'chacha-bhatija' (uncle-nephew) bond after Owaisi repeated his demand to repeal the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019.“Owaisi and BJP share a bond of 'chacha-bhatija' (uncle-nephew). He should not talk about this on TV, he can just ask directly,”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tie-him-down-here-tikait-s-veiled-jibe-in-hyderabad-at-unbridled-bull-owaisi-101637857332780.html

Jaishankar made the remarks while addressing the meeting of the SCO council of heads of government that was held virtually under the chairmanship of Kazakhstan. He also spoke on the need for reformed and invigorated multilateralism to reflect contemporary realities. “It is unfortunate to note that there have been repeated attempts to deliberately bring bilateral issues into SCO. This violates the well-established principles and norms of SCO Charter,” he said. “Such acts are counterproductive to the spirit of consensus and cooperation that define this organisation and should be condemned,” he added. India, Jaishankar said, considers the SCO an important regional group to promote cooperation in different fields on the basis of “universally recognised international norms, good governance, rule of law, openness, transparency and equality”. Indian officials have accused Pakistan in recent years of repeatedly attempting to raise bilateral issues such as Kashmir at meetings of different SCO bodies. During a virtual meeting of national security advisers of SCO states in September 2020, NSA Ajit Doval walked out after his Pakistani counterpart, Moeed Yusuf, projected a map that inaccurately depicted the borders of the two countries and included several Indian regions within Pakistan. Jaishankar, who represented India at Thursday’s meeting, said SCO is observing its 20th anniversary in a rapidly changing global and regional environment. SCO continues to play a significant role in promoting peace and stability in the region in times of unprecedented upheaval, and India is committed to constructively contributing to implementing the mandate of the grouping, he said. The socio-political impact of Covid-19 is “far from over and has exposed the weakness of global institutions”, he noted. “This is the time to bring in much needed reforms to our global institutions, including the WHO, and rework our development strategies to face a post-Covid-19 world,” he said. “For this, we need a reformed and reinvigorated multilateralism that reflects today’s realities, which gives voice to all stakeholders, addresses contemporary challenges and puts human beings at the centre of our thought and policies,” he added. India believes greater connectivity is an economic force multiplier that has acquired greater importance in the post-Covid era, though “any serious connectivity initiative must be consultative, transparent and participatory”, Jaishankar said. Such initiatives “must conform to the most basic principle of international law – respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity”, he pointed out. In this context, Jaishankar spoke about India’s efforts to operationalise Chabahar port in Iran in order to provide secure and commercially viable access to the sea for Central Asian state. “We have also proposed to include the Chabahar port in the framework of International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC). I would like to reaffirm India’s commitment to cooperate, plan, invest and build physical and digital connectivity in the SCO region,” he said. Jaishankar also referred to climate change being the “biggest existential threat” for many developing countries and said: “As we move towards practical implementation of the trade and economic agenda of SCO, we must simultaneously pay heed to the climate change impact of our joint activities.” India now ranks fourth in the world in installed renewable energy capacity, and its non-fossil fuel energy has increased by more than 25% in the past seven years. It co-initiated the International Solar Alliance that now has more than 100 member states and is ready to share its experience in climate change mitigation and adaptation in the SCO format, he said. The meeting was attended by leaders of SCO member states, observer states, the SCO secretary general, and the executive director of the SCO Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure (RATS).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-swipe-at-pakistan-jaishankar-condemns-repeated-bids-to-bring-bilateral-issues-into-sco-101637858370404.html
25-11-2021||India||India’s nominee elected to executive committee of Interpol||Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) special director Praveen Sinha was on Thursday elected the delegate for Asia in the executive committee of the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol) following a tough contest involving China. The Indian candidate was pitted against four others from China, Singapore, South Korea and Jordan for two posts in the election, and Indian diplomats were engaged in a sustained campaign in New Delhi and capitals around the world to get the backing of a large number of countries, people familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. The election was held in the Turkish city of Istanbul during the 89th Interpol general assembly. CBI represents India’s interests in Interpol, which comprises 194 member countries that have agreed to ensure the widest possible assistance between criminal police authorities to prevent crimes. Ahmed Nasser Al Raisi of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) was elected the organisation’s new president at the same general assembly. He was elected following three rounds of voting as he could not attain the mandated two-thirds majority in the first two rounds. One of the people cited above described the Indian candidate’s election to the executive committee as the “result of an intense and well-coordinated election campaign across the world”. India sought the support of friendly countries at different levels during recent bilateral engagements. The country’s missions around the world also regularly followed up the matter with host governments. At the same time, the Indian side also reached out to ambassadors and high commissioners of numerous countries in New Delhi, the people said. The National Central Bureau (NCB-India) also reached out to its counterparts around the world to campaign for the election, and India’s ambassador to Turkey, Sanjay Panda, camped in Istanbul for the past few days to hold bilateral meetings with delegations from around the world as part of a final effort to gain support for the Indian candidate, the people said. The people said Interpol plays a vital role in tackling the trans-national organised crimes, terrorism and cyber-crimes. India will continue to actively contribute to Interpol’s aims and objectives and to enhance its effectiveness, they added. PC Sharma, the then director of CBI and head of NCB-India was elected Interpol’s vice-president for Asia for 2003-06.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-nominee-elected-to-executive-committee-of-interpol-101637855430167.html

Our recovery rate has also dramatically improved from 26 (cents on dollar) to 71.6 (cents on dollar),” he said.The Union minister said the IBC has brought about a marked shift in attitudes of lenders and borrowers, acting as an effective deterrent against unscrupulous borrowers and imparted banks the tool to follow due diligence and confidence about recovery.ALSO READ | FM Sitharaman tables bankruptcy code bill aimed at small firmsGoyal said the Centre suspended the IBC for a year – from March 2020 till March 2021 — in view of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. “This helped India bounce back much faster. The economy is doing well and five years down the line the outlook looks very, very bright,” Goyal said.Goyal added that the IIIPI members are serving the nation’s interest by saving businesses and entrepreneurship in the country. “This has a big impact on ‘saving jobs and eviving companies’ and by creating new banking opportunities," he said.ALSO READ | Bankruptcy code reforms must be handled with special cautionStating that the IIIPI being the largest body of such professionals in the country, it has a fiduciary duty cast on its members and has a three-pronged roles to play — legislative, executive and quasi-judicial. Goyal listed out five guiding principles for insolvency professionals — integrity, objectivity, competency, confidentiality and transparency.

25-11-2021||India||Will review ‘error’ in Hindi NEET paper, NTA to SC on plea seeking new merit list||NEW DELHI: The National Testing Agency (NTA) will revisit the Hindi translation of one question of NEET (UG), the national entrance exam for admission to undergraduate medical courses, solicitor general Tushar Mehta told the Supreme Court on Thursday.Mehta’s assurance to a bench headed by justice Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud came on a petition by 22 aspirants who asked the Supreme Court to order the NTA to delete the erroneous question and declare their results afresh.NTA, a government-run testing agency mandated to conduct entrance examinations for higher education institutions, told the Supreme Court that a committee of three experts examined the alleged error flagged by the aspirants but concluded that there was nothing wrong in the Hindi translation.But lawyer Archana Pathak Dave persisted, pointing out that the words “amplitude of current” appearing in the English translation was absent in the Hindi translation thus leading to a different answer altogether.In their petition, the students said the discrepancy in question 2 of Section A-15 (physics) in the question paper bearing code P-2 put Hindi-speaking students/states in a disadvantageous position. This would push them back by thousands of ranks and jeopardise their future, thereby breaching the fundamental rights of these students as enshrined under the Constitution.To allay the concerns, Mehta said the committee of neutral experts will be asked to evaluate the question again. The bench recorded this statement in its order and said, “After this process is done, an affidavit would be filed before this Court setting out the result of the evaluation of the solutions.” The court posted the matter for hearing on Tuesday.Out of the 15 lakh students who appeared for NEET-UG 2021, nearly 2 lakh students opted to attempt the examination in Hindi.The examination was conducted on 12 September.The NTA announced the results of NEET-UG early this month and an answer key was released on the basis of the English translation, thereby putting the Hindi-speaking candidates at a disadvantageous position, the petition said.The NTA treats only the English version of the questions as final and for this reason, the petitioners had approached the top court, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-review-error-in-hindi-neet-paper-nta-to-sc-on-plea-seeking-new-merit-list-101637853150015.html

"It is imperative that all international travellers travelling from and transiting through these countries and also including all other 'at risk' countries are subjected to rigorous screening and testing. The contacts of these international travellers must also be closely tracked and tested," health secretary Rajesh Bhushan wrote to states and UTs at a time when the Covid-19 situation in the country is improving.In its letter to the states, the Centre said multiple cases of this new variant have been reported in Botswana (3 cases), South Africa (6 cases) and Hong Kong (1 case)."This variant is reported to have a significantly high number of mutations and thus has serious public health implications for the country, in view of recently relaxed visa restrictions and opening up of international travel," the Centre said.According to reports, South African scientists have identified the new variant as concerning as it has unusual mutations which could help it evade the body's immune response and make it more transmissible. This new variant, according to a statement by Francois Balloux, director of the UCL Genetics Institute, possibly evolved during chronic infection of an immuno-compromised, likely in an untreated HIV/AIDS patient.Officials of the World Health Organization took note of the new variant and held a meeting to discuss B.1.1529."Early analysis shows that this variant has a large number of mutations that require and will undergo further study," the WHO said.South African health minister Joe Phaahla said the variant was of "serious concern" and behind an "exponential" increase in reported cases, making it "a major threat". Scientists said the new B.1.1.529 variant has at least 10 mutations, compared to two for Delta or three for Beta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centres-warning-about-international-passengers-as-new-covid-variant-found-in-south-africa-101637852377485.html
25-11-2021||India||What is Kerala's 'halal' food controversy? Explained||The halal food controversy in Kerala which has taken the form of full-fledged campaigning on social media started when it was reported that halal jaggery was being used to prepare 'aravana' and 'appam' in the Sabarimala temple. Now that there are campaigns against halal food, here is all you need to know about the present controversy.What is halal food?Halal means permissible in Arabic. Halal food refers to food prepared adhering to Islamic law. For example, halal meat refers to meant procured in a specific way of killing an animal that involves slaughtering it through a cut to the jugular vein, carotid artery and windpipe.What is the controversy over halal food in Kerala?> SJR Kumar, a former president of Vishva Hindu Parishad Kerala, approached the high court seeking direction to stop the distribution of Aravana and appam made of halal jaggery in Sabarimala. 'Aravana' is a payasam made out of jaggery and rice, and 'appam' is a sweet rice- and jaggery-based fritter. Both are distributed as prasadam at Sabarimala.> The Travancore Devaswom Board which runs the temple told the court that the quality of the jaggery used for making prasadam was being tested in the laboratory at Pampa. They also told the court that the quality of the two sweet dishes were being tested in the laboratory at Sannidhanam, before distributing the same to the devotees.Campaign against ‘halal’ food in Kerala triggers concerns> Why is there a halal stamp on the packet of jaggery? The Board said that the Maharashtra firm from where they got the packets export them in bulk to Arab countries.> Dismissing the controversy as motivated, the Board said it was a calculated attempt to attack the reputation of Sabarimala and to hurt the religious feelings of the pilgrims and thereby destroying the communal harmony through various posts published and circulated in social media.> The Board also said that this particular firm has been supplying jaggery to the temple since 2019.> As the food controversy is taking a political shape in Kerala, the youth wing of the CPM organised a food street programme in response where various types of dishes, including beef, pork, chicken and biryani were prepared. The party accused the BJP and the Sangh Parivar outfits of mixing religion with food.> BJP state president K Surendran said there is no check on the rise of Islamic extremism and terror in Kerala and the entire state is flooded with halal meat shops. "...Kerala coming near to becoming Syria, that is the general feeling of the common man," he had said.> What is spit-free food? In the ongoing campaigning against halal food, people are asking for spit-free food. The petition of SRJ Kumar may have an answer to this. "The religious scholars of the Muslim community have been proclaiming publicly that saliva is a necessary ingredient for certifying Halal in the preparation of food materials...however, different views were also expressed by a section of religious leaders," the plea of the petitioner said. This might have given birth to the 'spit-free' food campaign on social media.> The Kerala high court asked the petitioner whether he understands the concept of the word halal. The high court clarified its understanding of the word halal. "The concept of halal says that certain things are prohibited. All other things are halal. This certification only says that those prohibited materials are not included in a particular product," the bench said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-is-kerala-s-halal-food-controversy-explained-101637850903350.html

India is pursuing reformed multilateralism as a key driving principle for the purposeful reform of existing global institutional structures, Naidu said in a virtual address at the Asia–Europe Meeting (ASEM) Summit. The theme for the two-day summit is “Strengthening multilateralism for shared growth” and the event witnessed the participation of all 51 member countries, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) and the European Union (EU). The ASEM Summit is a biennial event and part of the process that sets priorities for cooperation between Asia and Europe on political, economic, financial, social, cultural and educational issues. Naidu, who led the Indian delegation at the summit, emphasised the need for reforming the UN Security Council and other key global organisations to make them reflective of contemporary realities and capable of dealing with challenges. The multitude of challenges in today’s dynamic and interdependent world cannot be addressed by out-dated systems designed to deal with challenges of the past, Naidu said. Pointing to the urgent need to re-imagine international cooperation, he said: “It is the lack of a coordinated global response that has exposed the vulnerabilities and weaknesses of the multilateral system as it stands today.” Naidu also said development suffers without peace and that the lack of development and stifled economic progress create fertile ground for violence and instability. He backed efforts to promote economic activity and enhance livelihood security and suggested this will go a long way in the recovery of countries affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. The pandemic has also exposed fault-lines ranging from unreliable global supply chains to inequitable vaccine distribution, and this underlines the need for strengthened multilateralism, he said. Noting that the re-imagined post-pandemic world will make very different demands from the multilateral system, he highlighted four areas for international economic cooperation – resilient and reliable supply chains, health security, digital for development, and green and sustainable recovery. Naidu also stressed the need to mitigate the causes of persistent insecurity at a global level and the need for reforms in the international structure for maintaining peace and security. The countries in ASEM represent 65% of global GDP, 60% of global population, 75% of global tourism and 55% of international trade. Besides the opening ceremony and the first plenary session of the summit, Naidu will join the retreat session and exchange views on areas such as reformed multilateralism, countering Covid-19, post-pandemic recovery, mitigating global climate change, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and maritime security.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/existing-multilateral-system-has-no-answers-for-contemporary-challenges-venkaiah-naidu-101637851649811.html

On Wednesday, the Jammu and Kashmir police neutralised three terrorists, one of them identified as Mehran Yaseen Shalla, a top commander of The Resistance Force (TRF).Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mehbooba Mufti, however, alleged that the official version was “far from truth” and not in line with “ground realities”. Referring to the controversial Hyderpora encounter in which two civilians were killed, Mufti said that “legitimate doubts” are looming over the authenticity of the Rambagh encounter as well.“After yesterday’s alleged encounter at Rambagh legitimate doubts are looming over its authenticity. As per reports & witnesses it seems that the firing was one sided. Again the official version far from truth is not in line with ground realities as seen in Shopian, HMT & Hyderpora,” she tweeted.Police said that Mehran was involved in the recent killings of two teachers and other civilians in the Valley which prompted security forces to intensify counter-terrorism operations. The other two terrorists killed in the encounter were identified as Manzoor Ahmad Mir and Arafat Ahmad Sheikh, both residents of Pulwama.When asked about the PDP leader’s doubt over the legitimacy of the encounter, Jammu and Kashmir DGP Dilbagh Singh said that some people understand the ground reality but try to say something different.In a strong response, Singh said this is high time people look at reality “without mixing it up with their imagination”. He added that the “encounter has brought relief to the people who lost their dear ones, therefore anybody talking nonsense is absolutely not justified,”“There are people who understand the reality but try to say something which is away from the reality…Unfortunately, there are people who have started looking at killers as innocent people.." Singh said.#WATCH |"There are people who understand the reality but try to say something which is away from reality. There are people who have started looking at killers as innocent people..,"says J&K DGP Dilbag Singh when asked that Mehbooba Mufti is casting aspersions on y'day's encounter pic.twitter.com/Dk9Jozhm2rSingh informed that all but one terrorist involved in the recent civilians is still alive as search remains on.“After the (civilian) killings, dozens of successful operations took place, over 20 terrorists have been gunned down. All terrorists, who were involved in the recent civilian killings, have been killed in these encounters. Only one terrorist, Basit remains.

All these issues will be raised,” he added.The multiple statements on opposition unity came amid a string of exits from the Congress most of whom moved over to the Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress that is eyeing a larger national role ever since its thumping win of the West Bengal assembly election earlier this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-inflation-oppn-unity-cong-mps-strategise-at-sonia-s-residence-101637850454686.html
25-11-2021||India||Kejriwal says 'vote for Congress in Punjab if...' in a Twitter war with Pargat Singh||In a Twitter war with Punjab education minister Pargat Singh, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday urged people to vote for the Congress. But there is a catch. The chief minister wrote, "Those who are happy with Punjab's schools and the current education system, vote for the Congress. Vote for AAP if you want a brilliant education system like Delhi in your state."This was in reply to Punjab education minister Pargat Singh's tweets in which he said that the Delhi chief minister might have missed the developed picture of Punjab's education system as he is a Delhiite and gets interested in Punjab issues only around elections. पंजाब शिक्षा मंत्री का कहना है कि पंजाब के स्कूल देश में सबसे अच्छे हैं, टीचर बहुत ख़ुश हैंजो लोग पंजाब के स्कूलों और मौजूदा शिक्षा व्यवस्था से ख़ुश हैं, वो कांग्रेस को वोट दे दें। जो पंजाब में भी दिल्ली जैसी शानदार शिक्षा व्यवस्था चाहते हैं, वो हमें वोट दे दें https://t.co/shsduSwDMx"Arvind Kejriwal ji, there is already a revolution going in education in Punjab. It is another matter that you missed it. It is understandable for a Delhiite whose interest in Punjab is aroused only around elections. Punjab topped the country in school education in National Performance Grade Index (NPGI) in the most recent survey. Delhi came 6th. Punjab was above Delhi on all 5 parametres -learning outcomes, Access, Infrastructure & Facilities, Equity and Governance in the survey," Punjab education minister said adding that the pupil to teacher ratio in Punjab government schools is 24.5:1 compared to 35:1 in Delhi."Since your information about the state is so patchy, I will like to tell you that we are already in the process of recruiting more than 20k teachers by December end. This is in addition to 8,886 who have been regularised already. 1,117 staff members have been promoted and more are on the way," the minister tweeted urging Kejriwal not to worry about the transfer policy of teachers in Punjab.The exchange comes at a time when the war of words between the Congress and the AAP has got intensified ahead of the assembly elections. Accusing Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi of copying his policies, Kejriwal recently said that Channi is a 'nakli Kejriwal'. "Beware of him. Don't go by his words. I keep all my promises made to the people," Kejriwal recently said.Punjab Congress chief Navjot Sidhu on Wednesday took a jibe at AAP's 'populism' and tweeted that people won't fall prey to populist schemes that lack budget allocation and a proper framework. "Schemes are just made to take credit, a fast-paced reaction to popular demands, without thought of governance and economy. History tells populist measures only hurt people in long run. True leaders will not give lollipops but will focus to build the foundations of society and economy. Credit games don't last, they put more baggage of debt and depressed economic growth onto society. Punjab needs a policy-based redemption and soon every Punjabi will be wealthy and prosperous as we were in earlier times. Punjab model is the only way forward!!" Sidhu wrote without naming AAP or Kejriwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kejriwal-says-vote-for-congress-in-punjab-if-in-a-twitter-war-with-pargat-singh-101637847268412.html

The Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha said the party leadership, including Sonia and Rahul Gandhi, were looking into the matter.“This is happening like a conspiracy. People of our party, especially our party president, Rahul Gandhi and others in the high command, are looking into it. They will take a decision,” Kharge was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.As many as 12 Congress MLAs, including former chief minister Mukul Sangma, switched over to the Trinamool Congress on Wednesday making it the main opposition party in the hill state.However, Kharge said despite all latest developments the Opposition would try and fight unitedly in Parliament against the Narendra Modi-led government.“Fights have always taken place. No use commenting now. It is important to fight together in the arena of Parliament as Rahul Gandhi, in a core committee meeting of floor leaders, had said that parties may have different ideologies but our common goal is to fight the BJP,” the senior Congress functionary said.“I'd like to say that we'll try to come together to defeat BJP in Parliament and fight against their ideology, regardless of the party or ideology we may belong to.

25-11-2021||India||Campaign against ‘halal’ food in Kerala triggers concerns||On Tuesday, a popular restaurant in Thiruvananthapuram received an unusual call. After ordering a Thalassery (north Kerala) biryani and another dish, the caller said: “Hope you will ensure spit-free food.” It took some time for a restaurant employee to understand that the caller was perhaps influenced by a campaign of far-right groups against halal food. Many Muslim-owned hotels have complained that they get many similar inquiries. Social media are also abuzz with a campaign against halal food with some calling popular dishes “thuppal shawarma”, “thuappl mandi”, and “thuppal biryani”. Thuppal means spit in Malayalam.Hotel owners allege some Christian outfits have also joined the hate campaign and there are many WhatsApp groups identifying “spit-free” hotels in particular areas. Many fake videos have also surfaced to boost the campaign.Also Read: BCCI’s ‘halal’ meat recommendation for Indian cricketers raises eyebrowsThe latest campaign against halal food began after S J R Kumar, the convener of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)-backed Sabarimala Karma Samiti, filed a petition in Kerala high court last week questioning halal stamp on jaggery packets supplied to the Sabarimala Temple. He wrongly claimed Muslim scholars have said “saliva is a necessary ingredient for certifying halal preparations.” Kumar called it an insult to devotees who take prasad made of this jaggery.The temple board said the Maharashtra-based supplier of the jaggery also exports it to West Asian countries and the halal specification came up inadvertently. The plea is pending in court.It later came to light that the supplier--a Maharashtra-based sugar firm--is owned by a Shiv Sena leader from Pune.The petition prompted the social media campaign against halal food. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is finding it hard to get a foothold in Kerala, jumped on the bandwagon. “We have not raked up the issue. Many eating joints are showing halal boards prominently these days, especially in north Kerala. Some fundamentalist outfits are setting a communal agenda like the way they popularised the veil in the state,” said BJP state president K Surendran.BJP spokesman Sandeep Warrier, who wrote a post over the issue, was forced to withdraw it. “Hindus and Muslims cannot survive by boycotting each other in a state like Kerala,” he wrote.On Sunday, BJP leader P Sudheer sought a ban on public display of halal boards saying “it was unfit in a secular society”.The Kerala Hotel and Restaurant Association has requested chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and state police chief Anil Kant to rein in elements campaigning against halal food. “It will vitiate the atmosphere and affect our businesses that are coming out of the pandemic shock slowly. Halal supporters and haters are camping vigorously. It is really bad for the hotel industry,” said G Jayapalan, the association secretary.l V P Suhaib Moulavi, the prayers leader at Thiruvanthamouram’s Palayam mosque, said halal simply means something that is permissible. “Certain foods are not permissible. Blowing at food is against the preaching of the Prophet,” he said.Kerala Muslim Jammat secretary A Saifuddin Haji said halal was only a symbolic gesture of seeking blessing and no spitting or blowing were involved.Muslim thinker Prof M N Karassery called the controversy unwarranted. “Some groups from both sides are fanning trouble over a non-issue. Problems start when you impose your customs and beliefs on others. I feel Kerala society is mature enough to see designs of these forces,” he said. He added it was also wrong to display halal boards.Some Christian organisations have also pledged support to the anti-Halal campaign. “An Arab food culture invaded the state in a decade or so. We are not against it but many traditional cuisines are disappearing in the process. And many hotels display halal boards prominently provoking others. We are against invasion of particular food culture,” said Church Auxiliary for Social Action, a Christian organisation supporting the campaign against halal food.The ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) or CPI (M) came down heavily on RSS affiliates saying their ploy to polarise society will not succeed in Kerala. “Debate on halal was unnecessary and uncalled for and it is aimed at destroying communal amity of the state. Progressive society of Kerala will reject it with condemnation it deserves,” said CPI (M) Politburo member Kodiyeri Balakrishnan.He asked the party’s youth wing to expose elements trying to create a rift in society.Activist Rahul Eswar, a grandson of Sabarimala chief priest, said one cannot see politics everywhere. “In Sabarimala, there is a small shrine of a Muslim saint Vavar Swami. Pilgrims first offer prayers there before scaling 18 holy steps of the temple.”Muslims account for 27% of Kerala’s population and are politically, socially, and economically much better off than Muslims in the rest of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/campaign-against-halal-food-in-kerala-triggers-concerns-101637840908105.html

Accusing his own government is not new for Sidhu as the Congress chief, in past, too seemingly carried out the role of 'conscience' as he continuously criticised the Amarinder Singh government leading to a major upheaval in the state as Amarinder Singh's government was toppled. As Charanjit Singh Channi became the new chief minister, Sidhu continued his "war against injustice" while the apparent cracks between Channi and Sidhu regarding appointments were papered over.'Congress trying to suppress Navjot Sidhu's voice': Kejriwal in PunjabWith a few months left before the elections, which will be more interesting this time because of the Amarinder Singh factor, Sidhu has become active on social media and is tweeting about the policies that he catalysed.  On Thursday, Sidhu said he proposed a new law to recover stolen state taxes from Fastway, a cable TV company, by taking control over computers and data hidden by the company. Sidhu said it could have freed the cable operators from the clutches of this monopoly by Fastway and filled the state coffers. But Captain Amarinder Singh stalled his proposal, Sidhu tweeted.Soon after Charanjit Singh Channi became the chief minister, Sidhu resigned from the post of the Punjab Congress chief as he was unhappy with some of the appointments. After several rounds of negotiations, Sidhu agreed to continue in his post as Channi took a step back. Finally, Sidhu had his way as the DS Patwalia became the advocate general replacing APS Deol. Sidhu had opposed Deol's appointment as he had represented former Punjab DGP Sumedh Singh Saini in cases related to the 2015 police firing incidents after the desecration of a religious text.With that episode left behind, this is another major offensive by Sidhu against the Channi government, which indicates that the infighting between Congress in Punjab is far from over though Amarinder Singh has quit the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/navjot-sidhu-at-it-again-threatens-hunger-strike-against-channi-government-101637838780191.html

25-11-2021||India||NIA court rejects bail plea of Elgar Parishad accused Mahesh Raut||A special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court on Thursday rejected the bail application of forest rights activist Mahesh Raut, arrested in the Elgar Parishad case, for allegedly spreading Maoist ideology and encouraging unlawful activities. Raut’s counsel, Advocate Vijay Hiremath, informed the court that the forest rights activist has studied in Nagpur and Nashik, and then in 2011 passed out of the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS). He was teaching in Goa and did a fellowship on conflict zones, he is a former fellow of the prestigious Prime Minister’s Rural Development Programme of the ministry of Rural Development and has worked with the Gadchiroli collector, Hiremath added. It has been alleged that Raut had provided funds for banned organisations and sent some students to the jungle to join the Naxalite movement. However, the prosecution have not been able to provide a single name, his lawyer claimed. “There is nothing on record about the funding,” said Hiremath. “Equally, the charge-sheet does not contain anything about the allegation that Raut was a recruiter for the Naxalite movement.” NIA claimed that a letter found on co-accused Rona Wilson’s computer had Raut’s name. In this connection, Hiremath argued that the existence of the letter on the computer was disputed in the report of US-based Arsenal Consulting. On the basis of the report, the case has already been challenged in the High Court. It has been mentioned in the letter about one Mahesh and ₹5 lakh, but the agency has failed to find a money trail and also whether it is the same Mahesh or some other person. “These are all wild allegations,” Hiremath said. On the other hand, Prakash Shetty who represented NIA argued that Raut had already filed a bail application on similar grounds before a Pune court which was rejected and all the documents that Raut is referring to have already been considered by the Pune court while rejecting his bail plea. The agency claimed that a letter seized from Rona Wilson’s computer mentioned “Mahesh” and claimed that through unknown channels Raut passed on ₹5 lakh for the Elgar Parishad event to Sudhir Dhawale, Shoma Sen and Surendra Gadling. The Pune police, who initially investigated the case, had alleged that Raut had taken TISS students to meet absconding underground Maoist leaders in the jungles in 2017. The agency further claimed that Raut recruited two former TISS students for the Maoist Party and that those students underwent arms training in the jungles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-court-rejects-bail-plea-of-elgar-parishad-accused-mahesh-raut-101637835448070.html
25-11-2021||India||'Had Modi, Yogi wanted...': PM Modi's 10 quotes at Noida Airport inauguration||The ground-breaking ceremony of the Noida International Airport could have taken place in 2017, soon after the Yogi Adityanath government came to power in the state as the project was conceptualised by the previous BJP government, PM Modi said as he addressed the event on Thursday at Jewar in Uttar Pradesh. Going by the standard practice of politics, it would not have been frowned upon, PM Modi said, but BJP's politics is different from other parties that have been in power in Uttar Pradesh previously, the PM said. "We could have got photographed and the news would come at all newspapers. But this was the practice of the previous rule," PM Modi said. Taking the opportunity to slam opposition parties, PM Modi said parties used to announce projects without estimating the expenses, without acquiring land and that's why so many projects did not see the light of the day. 'Ganna or Jinnah': Yogi's jibe ahead of polls at Noida Airport inaugurationHere are the top 10 quotes of PM Modi1. Some political parties in our country have always put their self-interest first. The thinking of these people is self-interest, only their own, development of the family and the development of the area where they live. They think this is Vikas, while we follow the spirit of nation first, Sabka Saath - Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas, Sabka Prayas is our mantra2. Infrastructure is not part of politics for us but part of national policy.Watch: Jewar International Airport to be Asia's biggest, create jobs: All you need to know3. Previous governments deprived Uttar Pradesh of what it deserves. Be it scams, bad infrastructure, caste politics, UP was subjected to only criticism4. UP people used to wonder whether their state will never have a positive image. But the same UP is leaving its marks today internationally.5. After seven decades since Independence, Uttar Pradesh is getting its dues with the efforts of the double-engine government.6. The Noida International Airport will be the logistics gateway of north India. This will make the entire region a powerful reflection of the National Gatishakti masterplan.7. Now, Uttar Pradesh means Uttam Suvida (best facilities), nirantar nivesh (endless investment). Once this airport is ready, there will be five international airports. 8. The previous government of Uttar Pradesh even wrote a letter to the Centre asking it to stop the work of this airport. 9. Had Modi and Yogi wanted, we could have inaugurated the airport soon after we came to power. But this is not our politics.10. We make sure the project does not hit any roadblocks midway. If there is a delay, there is a provision of penalty as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/had-modi-yogi-wanted-pm-modi-s-10-quotes-at-noida-airport-inauguration-101637833981272.html
25-11-2021||India||Joined TMC as Congress is not an effective opposition: Mukul Sangma||Former Meghalaya chief minister Mukul Sangma on Thursday blamed the Congress’s inability in playing the role of an effective opposition and said this prompted him and 11 other lawmakers of the party to join the Trinamool Congress (TMC) a day earlier.“The pulse of the people says there is a need for a strong pan-India alternative as Congress is really failing to respond to its call of duty as the main opposition party in the country. Therefore, our exercise to find such a party ultimately culminated in this decision (to join TMC),” Sangma said at a press conference in Shillong with the 11 lawmakers.Sangma said they did an exhaustive study and explored the options available as they were failing in their role as an effective opposition. “We found it wanting in Congress despite trying to prevail upon the leadership. We were making trips after trips to Delhi while it should have been the other way round,” Sangma said.Sangma said his interactions with political strategist Prashant Kishore over the past few months led him and other Congress lawmakers to join TMC. He added the TMC fights against an ideology that is “not compatible with our nation with diverse people”. He said this was one reason why they joined the party. “We have every reason to believe that we will win the trust and confidence of the people (in the 2023 assembly polls).”Watch: Congress loses 12 of 17 Meghalaya MLAs to TMCHe added the decision was taken consciously and collectively after a lot of analysis and as part of a long-drawn exercise for the greater good of the people of Meghalaya and the nation. “We are setting a new trend for the future of the state, the region, and the nation with the utmost sense of humility but a complete sense of responsibility and commitment towards fulfilling our responsibility in serving the people, the state, and the nation.” He said the move to join TMC was a culmination of exhaustive due diligence analysis and trying to understand how best they can respond to their call towards their people.The defections of the 12 reduced the Congress’s strength in the 60-member state assembly to five and made the TMC the single largest opposition party without even contesting an election.

Minutes before Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the airport which will become Asia's biggest airport in the days to come, Yogi Adityanath said the Jewar is known for its exquisite sugarcane. "But some people replaced the sweetness with regular riots. Today, there are two options in front of the country -- whether the country will spread the sweetness of ganna or the hatred of Jinnah," the chief minister said sounding the poll bugle. Follow live updates of Noida International Airport ground-breaking eventYogi Adityanath's 'Ganna versus Jinnah' narrative dates back to 2018 when the chief minister came up with the coinage ahead of the Kairana bypolls. Ahead of the high-voltage Assembly election scheduled next year, Jinnah controversies have started surfacing in Uttar Pradesh again as Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav commented, "Sardar Patel, Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and (Muhammad Ali) Jinnah studied in the same institute and became barristers. They helped (India) get freedom and never backed away from any struggle." The Jinnah comment stirred a row in the state which Akhilesh denied to withdraw.The projected cost of Jewar airport is estimated at around ₹15,000- 20,000 crore and the development of the first phase of the airport is being done at a cost of around ₹10,050 crore, the ministry said. The airport will house two passenger terminals while adding that Terminal 1 will have a capacity of 30 million 10 passengers per year and Terminal 2 will have a capacity of 40 million passengers per year.According to the civil aviation ministry, terminal 1 will be built in two stages - the first for 12 million passengers per year and the second with an additional capacity for 18 million passengers per year. This phase is scheduled to be completed by the year 2024.

The injunction sought for restraining the NCP leader from posting statements on Dnyandev, his son Sameer Wankhede, Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) Mumbai zonal director, and their family. However, the court directed that Malik must conduct adequate verification of all information before posting them online.Although Malik won't be posting anything against Dnyandev till December 9, he informed the division bench of Justice SJ Kathawalla and Milind Jadhav on Thursday that he would file an appeal against certain portions of the November 22 high court order.This development comes after the NCP leader took to Twitter on Thursday morning to take a fresh dig at the NCB Mumbai chief by sharing documents pertaining to the NCB chief's mother Zaheda Bano's death. He shared Bano's death certificate wherein her religion has been mentioned as Hindu while another cemetery document shows her religion mentioned as Muslim.“One more forgery. Muslim for the last rites and Hindu on government documents?” the Maharashtra minister wrote on the micro-blogging site.Tension has been rife between Malik and Wankhede since the NCB busted the Mumbai drugs-on-cruise case, which quickly garnered nationwide attention due to the arrest and subsequent 20-day jail term of Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan's son, Aryan Khan.Malik has alleged Dnyandev is a Hindu, who converted to Islam before marrying Bano, and that Wankhede has utilised his father's previous identity to get a government job under the Scheduled Caste (SC) quota.However, the Wankhede family has consistently refuted all claims.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wont-post-anything-on-wankhede-family-till-december-9-says-nawab-malik-101637825692122.html
25-11-2021||India||National security comes first, says review panel chief on Data Protection Bill||Individual privacy cannot supersede national security, sovereignty and integrity, PP Chaudhary, the head of the joint parliamentary committee (JPC) that reviewed the proposed Data Protection Bill, has said days after the panel’s opposition party members argued that the new bill gives the government “unbridled power”. At least five penal members have submitted their dissent notes over the panel’s report.The JPC finalised the report on Monday and has suggested stricter compliance requirements for companies. It has added or tweaked clauses that provide for lighter obligations on government agencies and recommended a greater say for the state in the legal mechanism that will be set up to safeguard personal and non-personal data.“Sufficient safeguards have been provided in the bill to ensure that data is only accessed through a fair and proportionate procedure,” Chaudhary said. He added the only exemptions are the ones already provided for in the Constitution while referring to the contentious Clause 35 of the bill.Clause 35 empowers the government to provide exemptions to its agencies from the provisions of the bill.The panel has recommended that the procedure by which this exemption is claimed be “just, fair, reasonable and proportionate”. Also Read: MPs file dissent notes citing ‘reservations’ over Data Protection Bill reportThe clause allows the government to claim the exemption if it is satisfied that it is “necessary or expedient” to do so in the interest of purposes such as national security – a test that still exists in that form. The tests for just, fair and proportionate have been explained further as part of the procedure.Chaudhary said the procedures built into the bill provide for a framework even more detailed than the Constitution. “We have removed the provisions of public order and morality from the clause. But one must understand that national security cannot be compromised in lieu of individual privacy,” he said. “When the central government is satisfied that is necessary and expedient, it may grant exemptions, say to the army or to Intelligence Agencies, but under only the conditions provided for.”Chaudhary referred to Clause 12, which empowers the government to access data without consent. He added the intent of the bill is clear and that such action should only be taken in exceptional cases when it is required to provide benefits and services. “Is the government using data to provide ration through the public distribution system or provide funds under the MGNREGS (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme) not beneficial to people?” he asked. “We need to understand the limitation of people’s ability to provide consent. How can we obtain consent from the poor when the data is being processed in a centralised form?”Chaudhary said consent was paramount, but the aim was to prevent its misuse and not hinder its use for beneficial schemes. “If a service is being provided, then consent is not necessarily required.”The panel’s report will be tabled in Parliament during the Winter Session beginning November 29 for discussion, following which the government will re-introduce the bill, with amendments if needed as the recommendations are not binding.Chaudhary attacked the opposition parties for opposing the bill and said they have a “dissent ideology”. “We have to strike a fine balance,” he said. “The Parliament will enact the law, so it can look into it whenever it wants but to have it evaluate it on a day-to-day basis is untenable. The IT (information technology) parliamentary committee can also take it up and provide further recommendations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/national-security-comes-first-says-review-panel-chief-on-data-protection-bill-101637831127677.html

25-11-2021||India||Delhi high court dismisses plea seeking to ban Salman Khurshid's book: 'Ask people not to buy it'||The Delhi high court on Thursday dismissed a petition seeking to ban the sale, purchase, and all forms of circulation of a book written by Congress leader Salman Khurshid.The book titled ‘Sunrise Over Ayodhya: Nationhood in Our Times’ triggered extensive outbursts from certain political quarters, particularly over the fact that the author had compared a “robust version” of Hindutva to the jihadist Islam of terror groups such as the Islamic State (IS) and the Boko Haram."Dismissed," said Justice Yashwant Varma while hearing the plea filed by a lawyer Vineet Jindal."Why don’t you tell people not to buy the book? What can we do if people are feeling so sensitive? No one is asking them to read it," the court said further in its observation.The court also sought to know whether any untoward communal incident happened in the country because of the references made in the book. This happened after the petitioner's counsel told the court that communal riots might break out in the country because of the book. The court said that the breach of communal peace is a mere "apprehension"."Tell everyone the book is badly authored. Ask them to read something better,” the court remarked.The petitioner had said that the book violates “the fundamental right guaranteed under articles 19 and 21” of the Indian Constitution. Other than seeking a ban on the sale, purchase, and all forms of circulation, the petition also asked the court to ensure that it is not published henceforth in any form - neither print nor digital.Khurshid's house was vandalised in Nainital after the release of the book, with the parts of it set on fire allegedly by mobs. The Kumaun police had booked 21 people in connection with the incident.Khurshid's new book on the Ayodhya verdict was released last week. It explored the Apex Court's landmark judgment on the Ayodhya dispute.Even within the ranks of his own party, leaders differ on the debate over religious views. Khurshid's party colleague, Ghulam Nabi Azad, has publicly said that he did not agree with the former on the matter. “The comparison is factually incorrect and an exaggeration,” news agency PTI quoted Azad as saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-dismisses-plea-against-salman-khurshid-s-book-says-badly-authored-101637826271998.html

Municipal polls are being held on Thursday to nearly 334 seats in the urban local bodies which includes 13 municipal councils, six nagar panchayats and 51 wards of Agartala municipal corporation. Counting of votes is to be held on Sunday. The Court also allowed media coverage of the elections in the absence of CCTVs at all polling booths.The top court directed the polling officials to make necessary arrangements to ensure safety of ballots and unhindered counting of votes and ordered the polling officials in each booth to take the help of the central paramilitary personnel in the event of any exigency.A bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, Surya Kant and Vikram Nath said, “We direct the ministry of home affairs (MHA) to provide additional two companies of central armed paramilitary forces of its discretion as expediently as possible considering that polling has begun and to secure polling booths so that polling can take place without any disruption.”The order came while the Court was hearing a petition filed by All India Trinamool Congress (AITC) alleging violence in the state prior to the polls against their candidates and party workers. Based on the orders passed by the court earlier this week, the state government and director general of police (DGP) of Tripura filed joint status reports about steps taken to secure free and fair polls and action taken on complaints of violence as alleged by AITC.On Thursday, even the Communist Party of India (Marxist) filed an intervention application in the proceedings pointing to the disturbing situation in the state. For AITC, senior advocate Gopal Shankarnaraynan said that since voting began on Thursday, there were videos of outsiders entering polling booths and pressing the button. He also alleged that one of their candidates was not allowed to cast vote at a ward of Agartala municipal corporation.The state, represented by senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani, informed the Court that polls are peaceful and the only hindrance to free and fair polls was the present proceeding. He informed Court that after assessing security situation, the state DGP and home secretary requested Centre for two additional companies of central forces pursuant to which two additional companies of border security force (BSF) have been deployed in addition to the three battalions of central forces already present in the state. Additionally the state counsel Shuvojit Roy informed that 458 personnel of Tripura State Rifles have been deployed for law and order duties.Shankarnaraynan told the Court that a petition was pending before Tripura high court for installing CCTVs inside polling booth. But the state told the high court that the matter is being monitored by Supreme Court. The bench clarified that the issue of CCTVs was not before it and said that the high court was free to issue orders. However, since polling ends today, the Court directed the state election commission to issue immediate orders to the polling officials at each booth to allow access to print and electronic media for coverage of elections.On Tuesday, the court had refused to postpone the polls stating that postponing elections is a matter of last and extreme resort. The Court will hear the matter next week and has directed the DGP and Home Secretary to file a joint compliance report by next date of hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-orders-additional-central-forces-at-tripura-local-body-polls-101637823447210.html

The projects involve the upgradation of some sections and construction of viaducts and tunnels.Gadkari said he realised how people faced hardships in the absence of roads thanks to his visits to J&K after taking charge of his ministry. “The work on three corridors is on. The NH-44 (Jammu-Udhampur-Ramban-Anantnag) faced several challenges including forest clearance, landslides and then contractor, too, had to be changed but I assure you that the work will be completed within two years paving way for a four-hour journey to Srinagar from Jammu,” he said in his address after the inauguration in Doda. He added the work on NH-244 (Jammu-Udhampur, Chenani-Nashri tunnel-Doda-Kishtwar- Anantnag) and NH 144 (Jammu- Akhnoor-Nowshera- Rajouri-Bufliaz- Shopian–Srinagar) was also being executed.Gadkari said they were working on all three corridor projects. “Similarly, the work on a ring road project in Jammu is in full swing and will be completed soon.” He added said that an inter-model station will be constructed at Katra—the base camp of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi. “It is a religious place for all of us and therefore we plan to construct an inter-model station, for which a proposal has been submitted to the LG (Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha). The inter-model station will have a helipad, railway station, and bus stand at the same place. The helipad will be on the rooftop of the structure.” He said the station will be linked with the 650km-long Delhi-Katra expressway. “The feasibility report has already been done.”Also Read: Srinagar records coldest night of this winter seasonGadkari said the roads and allied amenities in J&K will match that of Switzerland, London, and America.

Corruption free system, fast-track decision-making, and transparency are the benchmark of our government.” He said the tunnel will reduce the travelling time from Leh to Srinagar considerably. Gadkari said he has discussed a proposal with Sinha to have air-conditioned electric buses with fares 30% cheaper in Jammu and for the long route as well. “We have (electric) buses that can run for over 600km.”Gadkari said their priority is to shift to green hydrogen than relying on conventional fuel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nitin-gadkari-lays-foundation-stone-of-key-highway-projects-in-jammu-and-kashmir-101637816667371.html

The union education ministry has constituted an 11-member committee to develop content for the training within the next three months.Officials said the teacher-training programme will be conducted under the ministry’s “Manodarpan” initiative that was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in July last year to provide support to students during the Covid-19 pandemic and beyond. The training will be provided in collaboration with the Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI).An official in the ministry’s department of school education and literacy said that the “psycho-social needs” of children and youth, aged between 15-24 years, has been compromised amid the Covid-19 pandemic. “It has brought the concerns of mental health and well-being in the picture even with more prominence... Schools play a significant role in the life of children and therefore can play a pivotal role to enhance the nature and scope of mental health interventions, address problems early, and in doing so reduce the stigma attached with mental illness. Therefore, there is a need to develop school-based interventions which can reduce risk factors and promote the mental health and well-being of children and adolescents,” said the official, who did not want to be named.Also Read: School reopening: How parents should mentally prepare childrenAccording to an Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) 2005 study, 12% to 13 % of school students in India suffer from emotional, behavioural, and learning problems such as anxiety, depression, learning difficulties, and suicidal tendencies, among others. Similarly,The State of the World’s Children report by Unicef released this year said mental health disorders among children and youth mostly remain undiagnosed as most of them are hesitant to seek any support or treatment.“Early childhood years are the foundational years and are critical periods for human development. Any event that occurs during this time has a long-lasting effect on academic, social, emotional and behavioural achievement in adulthood. The majority of the mental disorders occur during the transition period from childhood to young adulthood, with up to 1 in 5 individuals suffering from a clinically relevant mental health problem before the age of 25,” the official said.Another official in the ministry said that the idea is to sensitise and make schoolteachers aware of all the available interventions so that they can help students. “Broadly the programme would aim to inform teachers and staff on identifying characteristics, behaviours, symptoms and the requisite assistance for identified mental illness/problems. The attempt is to promote social and emotional competency and build resilience among children. Overall we aim to create and ensure a positive and safe school environment for all students,” the official said, adding the teachers will work in collaboration with counsellors, special educators and mental health professionals.The 11-member committee that will develop content for the training will be chaired by psychiatrist and a member of the working group on Manodarpan Dr Jitendra Nagpal. The programme is likely to kick-off ahead of the next academic session.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/schoolteachers-to-be-trained-to-identify-mental-health-issues-among-students-101637812046586.html

All you need to know“The delivery of four submarines--Kalvari, Khanderi, Karanj, and now Vela--reaffirmed India’s membership in the exclusive group of submarine-building nations,” said Ashish Singh, the public relations manager at MDL.Scorpene-class submarines can undertake multifarious missions such as anti-surface warfare, anti-submarine warfare, intelligence gathering, mine laying, area surveillance, etc. They are designed to operate in all theatres with the means to ensure interoperability. The state-of-the-art technology used in the construction of Scorpene-class submarines has ensured improved stealth features. The features include advanced acoustic silencing techniques, low radiated noise levels, hydro-dynamically optimised shape, and the ability to launch an attack using precision-guided weapons. Attacks can be carried out using both torpedoes as well as tube-launched anti-ship missiles at the same time, underwater or on the surface.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/navy-chief-admiral-karambir-singh-to-commission-ins-vela-today-101637810786632.html

The projects, which collective cost around ₹20,000 crore, are concerned with development in the areas of railways, road transport, power, and oil and gas.PM Modi reviewed the projects as he chaired the 39th Pragati summit on Wednesday. Pragati, or Pro-Active Governance and Timely Implementation, is a project-focused platform involving the Centre and various state governments.According to a government press release, nine agenda items were taken up for review, which comprised eight projects and a separate scheme. Among the eight projects, three were from the railways ministry, two projects each from the road transport and highways ministry and the power ministry, and one from petroleum and natural gas ministry.Also Read: PM Modi to lay foundation stone of Noida Airport in UP’s Jewar today“These eight projects, having a cumulative cost of about ₹20,000 crores, span seven states: Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra and West Bengal,” the government said in the press statement.In the 38 previous editions of Pragati meetings, a total of 303 projects worth around ₹14.64 lakh crore had been reviewed.During the latest summit, the PM also reviewed the “Poshan Abhiyaan” programme, underlining the importance of implementing it on a mission mode in all the states.Modi also spoke about the participation of self-help groups (SHGs) and similar local organisations in promoting awareness about children’s health and nutrition at the grassroots level, which could help widen the reach of the Poshan Abhiyaan programme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-reviews-eight-key-projects-costing-20-000-crore-at-pragati-summit-101637810186648.html
25-11-2021||India||'Not constitutionally mandated': Mamata Banerjee on why she didn't meet Sonia Gandhi||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, who is on an official visit to Delhi, said on Wednesday that she is not going to meet Congress president Sonia Gandhi. The Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief said it is not "constitutionally mandated" to meet Gandhi whenever she comes to Delhi."This time I sought time only from the prime minister. The leaders are all busy with Punjab polls. Work is first... Why should we meet Sonia every time? It is not constitutionally mandated," Banerjee told reporters after meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi. She raised the issue of the BSF's territorial jurisdiction in the state in the meeting with the Prime Minister, demanding that it be withdrawn.Banerjee shares close ties with the Congress president. But recent developments, such as exodus of key Congress leaders to TMC, its entry into Goa politics and other factors have led to tension between the two parties.The latest jolt to Congress came in Meghalaya where 12 of its 17 MLAs, including former chief minister Mukul Sangma, joined Trinamool Congress. The TMC has witnessed a steady stream of leaders joining its ranks after quitting from Congress in the last few months.In September, former Goa chief minister Luizinho Faleiro joined TMC after resigning from the primary membership of Congress. A month before that, Congress MP from Assam's Silchar and ex-president of All India Mahila Congress, Sushmita Dev had joined the TMC. Both were awarded Rajya Sabha seats after joining West Bengal's ruling party.Congress leader Kirti Azad and former Haryana Congress president Ashok Tanwar also recently joined TMC. Tanwar was once a close aide of Rahul Gandhi.Banerjee also said that expansion plans for the TMC are underway, indicating that a trip to PM's constituency Varanasi is planned. "I would visit Varanasi since Kamalapati Tripathi's family is now with us," added Banerjee.Rajeshpati Tripathi and Laliteshpati Tripathi, the grandson and the great-grandson of former UP chief minister Kamalapati Tripathi, joined the Trinamool Congress in October.On the Uttar Pradesh elections, Banerjee said that she was open to helping Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav if he needs the TMC's help."If Trinamool can help defeat the BJP in UP, we will go... If Akhilesh (Samajwadi chief Akhilesh Yadav) wants our help, we will help," she said.The TMC chief also said while her party has "started" in Goa, regional parties should slug it out in some states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-constitutionally-mandated-mamata-banerjee-on-not-meeting-sonia-gandhi-101637807733402.html

25-11-2021||India||Haryana CM likely to meet PM Modi, issues around farm laws may be discussed||Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar is expected to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday, news agency ANI reported. The meeting is likely to take place at 10.30am, it further said.The meeting comes against the backdrop of PM Modi's announcement of the repeal of the three farm laws a protest call given by the Samkyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) on the first anniversary of farmers' protest on November 26. The farmers have refused to end their protest despite assurance from PM Modi, saying they don't trust the Prime Minister and will end their stir only after Parliament passes the farm laws repeal bill.Haryana and Punjab saw the start of the farmers' protest immediately after the three bills were passed by Parliament in September last year. The protest has been going on since then.A cabinet meeting will be held today at 3pm at the Haryana Civil Secretariat.Khattar had on Friday last week welcomed PM Modi's announcement to repeal the Centre's three farm laws and urged farmers to end their protest."I would urge farmers sitting at the Delhi borders to immediately end their protest and return to their homes as the common man is also facing a lot of difficulties due to this agitation. Now, a positive attitude should be adopted towards this issue," Khattar said in an official release.The chief minister said the decision of the Prime Minister shows that keeping the interest of the public is paramount for him.The three contentious laws are the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance, Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The Union Cabinet on Tuesday approved the repeal of the three laws.

25-11-2021||India||Centre proposes allowing exploratory drilling for oil, natural gas in inter-tidal areas of CRZ||The Union government proposes to allow exploratory drilling for oil and natural gas in the intertidal areas of coastal regulation zones (CRZ) and let gas-based power plants function within similar protected areas in islands, floating these for public feedback as part of three draft notifications that experts say degrade fragile areas.CRZs are divided based on how far they are from the shore and high-tide areas, with varying levels of restrictions on the sort of activities that can be carried out.According to a draft notification issued on November 1, the Centre said several states and the Union ministry of petroleum sought amendments in the CRZ notification to allow small infrastructure projects, the removal of sand bars by traditional communities, exempting exploratory drilling in inter-tidal areas and letting people set up temporary beach shacks in CRZ areas of all coastal states.The draft notification introduces all these provisions, proposing to allow Coastal Zone Management Authority or State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA), instead of the Centre, to take decisions on these.“There is no ambiguity in our intention and its clear in the preamble why these draft notifications have been issued. Oil and gas exploration is like a research activity. Development and production will still require CRZ nod. We are waiting for responses on these draft notifications,” said a senior environment ministry official. There is a sixty day period for public to send in their comments and objections to the draft notifications.In another draft notification, dated November 18, the Centre has made provisions for gas power plants within the Island Coastal Regulation Zone (ICRZ). According to the draft, the Centre received a proposal from Andaman and Nicobar Coastal Zone Management Authority (ANCZMA) to include gas-based power plant within the ICRZ area to reduce dependence on diesel generator sets. The National Coastal Zone Management Authority has recommended the inclusion of gas-based power plant within ICRZ-III (a classification for relatively undisturbed rural areas between 200-500m from high tide) be considered.Another draft notification, also issued on November 18, makes provision for setting up of gas power plants in islands with geographical areas >100 sq km.Experts cautioned these tweaks could degrade fragile landscapes in coastal areas. “The proposed amendments need to be read along the economic aspirations that recognize expansion of the oil and gas industry as revenue earner for the government. The ministry’s proposal signals the partisan repurposing of fragile inter-tidal areas and marine areas which are crucial for biodiversity, important buffers in instances of climate events like cyclones and support fishing livelihoods. This is reinstated through the justification for these proposed amendments that heavily relies on the requests of sectoral ministries looking to expand petroleum gas and hydrocarbon footprint. This framing of the draft notification relegates fisherfolk, traders, coastal farmers or small-scale tourism operators as mere respondents and not partners in coastal development,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher, Centre for Policy Research.Last month, the Centre also released a consultation paper on amending the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, to bring significant changes to how forest land is managed in India, a move that will facilitate private plantations and the extraction of oil and natural gas from deep beneath forest land by drilling holes from outside the forest areas. Kohli said the new draft notifications cannot be considered in isolation because several policy tweaks are being made to ease environmental norms for these industries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-proposes-allowing-exploratory-drilling-for-oil-natural-gas-in-inter-tidal-areas-of-crz-101637800353636.html

On October 7, Kour and Chand were shot dead by gunmen inside the premises of the Government Boys Higher Secondary School in Srinagar’s Eidgah area.“He (Mehran) was involved in the killing of Meeran Ali Sheikh at Bulbul Lanker Nawa Kadal, killing of PSI Arshad Ahmad at Khanyar, killing of school Principal Supinder Kour and teacher Deepak Chand of Government Higher Secondary School. Prior to joining in terror ranks, several cases regarding his involvement in stone pelting incidents are also registered against him,” the spokesperson said.The spokesperson said that Ahmad was also involved in attacks on civilians, including the killing of labourer in Pulwama on November 16.A protest broke out at the site of the gunfight with locals alleging that the forces dragged the three men out the car and shot them. They countered the police version and said there was no gunfight.The killing of civilians had spread panic in the Valley. The attacks were discussed during home minister Amit Shah’s security review meeting in October. During the four-hour meeting, Shah directed the chiefs of intelligence and investigative agencies, and security forces to make rigorous efforts to wipe out terror from the Valley, people familiar with the development said. TRF, an arm of the Lashkar-e-Taiba terror outfit, claimed responsibility for most of the attacks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/terrorists-involved-in-civilian-killings-gunned-down-in-jk-101637799563803.html

The details will be provided after a meeting on November 26, which will be marked as the first anniversary of our protest,” Tikait said at a rally in Ghaziabad.The announcement comes even as the Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved a proposal to repeal the three contentious farm laws that resulted in tens of thousands of farmers protesting for over a year. The Cabinet’s nod will allow the government to table a “repeal bill” in Parliament to revoke three separate laws. A bulletin from the Lok Sabha listed the Farm Laws Repeal Bill, 2021, as one of the 26 pieces of legislation to be introduced during the session.Asserting that a law guaranteeing the MSP is a big issue for the protesting farmers, Tikait said: “The three bills were related to the public while the key demand of farmers is the guarantee on MSP... The government has 35 days and they should bring in law on MSP while they should also take entire responsibility of farmers, including compensation, who have died during the agitation.”Later, he tweeted: “This protest will not end yet. We have a meeting on November 27 after which we will take further decisions...”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/500-farmers-will-reach-delhi-on-nov-29-tikait-101637799034835.html

25-11-2021||India||Explainer on three capitals of Andhra Pradesh||HyderabadConfusion and uncertainty over the capital city of residuary Andhra Pradesh continues to prevail, even after seven years of bifurcation of the combined state. Perhaps, it is the only state in the country which doesn’t have a proper capital till now.As Amaravati, the world-class capital city on the lines of mythical Mahishmati in the epic film Baahubali, dreamt by Telugu Desam Party president and former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu on the banks of the Krishna, has turned into a virtual ghost city, the three capitals envisioned by his successor Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy on the lines of South Africa are still hanging in thin air, what with the plan caught in a legal wrangle.With the Andhra Pradesh state assembly on Monday unanimously passing a Bill repealing the two laws enacted in June 2020 on the three capitals, the uncertainty over the state capital has come back to square one.Though Jagan Reddy vowed to bring back a more comprehensive and fool-proof legislation that would answer all the doubts and overcome legal hurdles, when this uncertainty is going to end still remains a million dollar question.THE CAPITAL CONUNDRUMThe exercise over identifying the capital city for the residuary Andhra Pradesh began a few months before the bifurcation of the combined state. The UPA government constituted a five-member committee under the chairmanship of former home secretary K Sivaramakrishnan to suggest the place to build the capital city of Andhra Pradesh. The committee travelled to various parts of the state and submitted its report to then Union home minister Rajnath Singh on August 27, 2014.Though the committee did not recommend any particular place for the capital, it opposed the concept of building a Super City or Smart City on the lines of Hyderabad and also said the capital between Vijayawada and Guntur is incorrect because it would bring up economic and environmental problems.It also suggested a decentralised model for the capital city through three zones, instead of concentrating all the offices at one place. It, however, recommended that assembly, secretariat and the chief minister’s office should be set up in the state capital city.However, the newly-formed TDP government headed by N Chandrababu Naidu simultaneously constituted a separate advisory committee headed by minister for municipal administration P Narayana, which also toured different parts of the state and finally came up with the suggestion that the capital should be centrally located, equidistant from all regions of the state.That was how, the Naidu government zeroed in on the fertile agriculture zone between Vijayawada and Guntur as the capital city and named it as Amaravati, an ancient city of Sathavahana dynasty on the banks of the Krishna river which later transformed into a famed Buddhist centre, located a few kilometres from the proposed capital city.Thus, Naidu completely ignored the recommendations of the Sivaramakrishnan Committee and chose Amaravati as the capital. Though Jagan Reddy, too, extended his support to the establishment of the capital city at Amaravati, he later alleged that Naidu deliberately chose the place to benefit his own Kamma caste people, who bought big chunks of land as they were privy to the information about the location of the capital there.In December 2014, the Naidu government announced creation of a world class greenfield capital city in over 7,000 sq km area at Amaravati, much larger than Brihan Mumbai. He established AP Capital Region Development Authority (APCRDA) through a legislation in the state assembly to develop the capital city.APCRDA began acquiring 33,000 acres of fertile land from the farmers of 29 villages under land pooling by conducting gram sabhas to take their consent. APCRDA entered into an agreement with the farmers promising them to allot residential and commercial plots in the developed capital region whose value would match their original land value. Besides, it also agreed to pay certain amount of annuity to the farmers every year, besides subsistence allowance to the landless agriculture labourers.The foundation stone for the new capital Amaravati was laid on October 22, 2015, by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Soon, the Naidu government moved its seat of power from Hyderabad to Amaravati and it had built an interim government complex, a temporary high court building, a legislature complex, and even bungalows and apartments for lawmakers, judges, and officers in the next three years.While the Centre gave ₹2,500 crore for building the capital, the Naidu government obtained loans from banks. Even the World Bank had finalised a US $ 300 million loan for the Amaravati capital city. While the master plan for the capital was done by the Singapore government-run consultancy, the designs for the capital buildings were to be done by Foster and Partners of London.CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT, CHANGE OF PRIORITIESBut even before the grandiose plans of Naidu on Amaravati came to a shape, he lost power to YSR Congress party led by Jagan Mohan Reddy in May 2019.Within hours of taking charge as the new chief minister, Jagan hinted at dropping Amaravati as the state capital. He ordered that all ongoing works in the capital city be stalled forthwith and all payments made to the contractors be stopped.For the next six months, there was practically no activity in Amaravati capital region and the contractors abandoned the place due to lack of payments from the government and workers being left with no work.On December 17, 2019, Jagan suddenly came up with the idea of three capital cities – executive capital at Visakhapatnam, judicial capital at Kurnool and legislative capital at Amaravati. He made an announcement in the assembly to that effect, triggering massive protests from farmers of Amaravati, who gave away their lands for the capital.In fact, the Jagan government had begun the ground work on the three capital silently much earlier. He appointed an expert committee headed by retired IAS officer G N Rao and engaged an international consultancy – Boston Consultancy Group to work on the alternative capital models. And both the committees submitted their reports in a gap of one week, supporting the three capitals idea envisaged by Jagan.Jagan argued that the Sivaramakrishnan committee recommended decentralised administration, as focusing the entire development on one single mega capital would do injustice to other regions of the state. But his intention was obvious: he did not want to continue anything that his arch rival Naidu had planned.In January, the Jagan government introduced the two separate bills –the Andhra Pradesh Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of All Regions Bill, 2020, seeking to establish three capital cities and the Andhra Pradesh Capital Region Development Authority (Repeal) Bill, 2020 -- aimed at doing away with the authority created to develop Amaravati as the capital.Both the bills were passed by the state legislative assembly on January 20, 2020, but were stalled by the majority TDP members in the legislative council the following day. This prompted Jagan to move a resolution seeking abolition of the legislative council.Even as the farmers of Amaravati launched a massive agitation against the three capitals’ plan, the Jagan government went ahead with his proposal. Finally, in June 2020, the Jagan government reintroduced the two bills in the state assembly and got them passed again.Though the council stalled the bills again and recommended them to select committee, the officials of the state legislature stalled them on procedural grounds. Finally, on July 31, Governor Biswa Bhushan Harichandan gave its consent for the bills, which then became Acts.The farmers of Amaravati who formed into a joint action committee moved the high court challenging the two Acts. More than a hundred petitions were filed before the high court, most of them backed by the TDP.THREE CAPITALS IN LEGAL WRANGLEA division bench of the high court headed by former chief justice J K Maheshwari took up the hearing in August 2020 and ordered status quo on the capitals, thereby stalling the three capitals plan.The bench had a prolonged hearing of arguments from the counsels of the farmers as well as the government. But even as the hearing was going on, Justice Maheshwari was transferred, apparently after a letter written by Jagan Reddy to then CJI A J Bobde, making certain allegations against some high court judges including Maheshwari.Later, the issue came up before another bench headed by new chief justice Aroop Kumar Goswami, but it could not take up the hearing due to Covid-19 pandemic. The hearing was postponed twice and was finally posted on November 15, 2021.By then, Justice Goswami was transferred and the fresh bench headed by new CJ Justice Prashant Kumar Mishra took up the hearing.But even as the hearing was going on, the Jagan government suddenly announced withdrawal of the two legislations on the three capitals and abolition of the APCRDA on Monday. A bill repealing the earlier two legislations was passed by the assembly.WHY REPEALING THE CAPITAL BILLS?The chief minister did not explain the reasons for repealing the bills. He only said his government would bring a “better” and more “comprehensive” bill that would answer all the doubts of some sections of people over the three capitals and clears all legal queries.He sought to blame the TDP for this uncertainty over the capitals, as it was spreading apprehensions among a section of people and creating legal hurdles in the process. “The Act was being withdrawn in the larger public interest,” he said.A CMO official familiar with the development said legal experts had told Jagan that the legislations on the three capitals might be dismissed by the high court as there were a few loopholes. “The agreement between the APCRDA and the farmers on land pooling is fool-proof and it cannot be cancelled unilaterally by the government,” he said.Secondly, the high court was established at Amaravati with a Presidential order after taking consent from the Supreme Court. “The Jagan government cannot shift the judicial capital to Kurnool without the Supreme Court’s approval,” he said.These and a few other factors, forced the Jagan government to repeal the earlier laws on three capitals.WAY OUT FOR JAGAN, NOWNow, the question is what will the Jagan government do now. The chief minister made it clear that there is no question of going back on the three capitals plan. He only said he would bring about a more comprehensive bill on the same in future.However, it is not certain when he is going to do that. A senior YSRC functionary said on condition of anonymity that the government will appoint another committee comprising legal experts to work out the new legislation that would address the legal issues.“Maybe, he will retain the judicial and legislative capital at Amaravati with a bench at Kurnool and shift the executive capital to Viskhapatnam. He may also establish regional development boards for all the three regions. But it is too early to talk about what is in Jagan’s mind,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/explainer-on-three-capitals-of-andhra-pradesh-101637783124515.html
25-11-2021||India||Tamil Nadu steps in to sell tomatoes at lower rates||Chennai: With tomato prices soaring due to the north east monsoon downpour, the Tamil Nadu government has started the process of selling tomatoes between a price range of ₹85 and ₹100 per kg through state-run farm fresh outlets in 12 districts including Chennai from Wednesday. The state cooperatives department said in a statement that they are procuring 15 metric tonnes of tomatoes every day for this purpose. “The government is making efforts to supply tomatoes at a lower price to the public. Until this afternoon, 8 MTs of tomatoes were sold in these markets,” minister for cooperatives I Periyasamy said in a statement. “Until Tuesday, a kg of tomatoes in the open market was ₹140, and due to this move by the government, today it is around ₹90-100 per kg. Similarly the prices of other vegetables have also come down.”On Wednesday, Chennai’s main wholesale market saw tomatoes selling for ₹120 per kg while in other markets it has touched ₹140. Tamil Nadu primarily receives its tomatoes from two regions in Karnataka and three regions in Andhra Pradesh, says advisor to the Koyambedu Wholesale Vegetable Traders, V R Soundararajan. “Usually, during the north east monsoon, there will be a gap in the rains in the various parts of Tamil Nadu. But this time, there is heavy rain in all the southern districts at the same time. We have not experienced a situation like this in 30 years,” says Soundararajan. Soundarajan said that it was not just tomatoes that were being affected. “Tomatoes, brinjal, ladies finger reach Koyambedu from Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka and because of the rains, the crops are damaged, transport is affected so our supply has dwindled,” he said. After tomatoes, the vegetables that cost the highest per kg in the retail market are ladies finger ( ₹80), beans ( ₹71), brinjal ( ₹72).K Pushparaj, a small vendor who supplies fruits and vegetables door-to-door said that he has stopped purchasing tomatoes from the wholesale market. “Tomatoes have become a luxury for some so a few residents have stopped buying it,” he said.The prices have been steadily increasing since the arrival of the north east monsoon in the state in October and have skyrocketed since heavy spells of rain caused severe damage and havoc in Chennai, delta districts and southern districts. Between November 6 and 7 and on November 11 Chennai received 21 cm and 16 cm respectively. From October 1 to November 18, Chennai and Tamil Nadu received 66% and 61% of excess rainfall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-steps-in-to-sell-tomatoes-at-lower-rates-101637782886143.html
25-11-2021||India||Civic body draws up ₹900cr estimate to fix drainage system to check flooding||The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP, the city’s civic body) on Wednesday drew up a rough estimate of ₹900 crore to complete remaining works of primary and secondary drains in the city to prevent rain-related floods in the future, adding to piling expenditures the city corporation claims to have spent at least in recent years.“Work on 51km of primary drains and 38km of secondary drains should be taken up immediately. The BBMP Special Commissioner has been instructed to prepare the DPR (detailed project report) for this project which would cost ₹900 crore. Special grants would be provided for this and instructions have been issued for speedy completion of the works without disturbing the general public,” chief minister Basavaraj Bommai said.Data from successive BBMP budgets shows that the civic body draws up elaborate plans for storm water drains (SWDs) or Raja Kaluves, secondary and tertiary drains each year that has so far proved to be counterintuitive to its purpose of preventing floods in Bengaluru.Bommai said there were around 842 Raja Kaluves in Bengaluru of which the works for 415 kms were completed. In 2019, approval was given for 75 km of which 40 km will be completed and another 30 km will be completed by January end.Interestingly, the BBMP got a grant of ₹1,054.87 crore in 2014-15 which the centre had approved under Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) for the “comprehensive development” of SWD of which the BBMP provided ₹320.76 crore.“Under ‘JNNURM’ grants a sum of ₹1,054.87 crore has been approved by the central government for comprehensive development of SWD in new zones. The BBMP has provided ₹320.76 crore in the budget,” according to the 2014-15 BBMP budget.The BBMP and other civic agencies in Bengaluru have a reputation of making tall promises with each budget, earmarking crore, but with little to show for on ground. Similarly, in 2016-17, the BBMP earmarked ₹300 crore for SWD that includes works to “rejuvenate and construct the primary drain of 415.50 km and 426.50 km of secondary drains connecting these valleys.”The successive or preceding years have been no different as the state government and civic bodies continue to show hundreds and thousands of crore in expenditure for SWD, lake rejuvenation, laying of roads and other public infrastructure that is often seen to be of poor quality or non-existent.Bommai himself had said during the monsoon session of the state legislature in September that the state government had spent over ₹20,000 crore for road-related works in Bengaluru alone over the last five years. “There are 94 critical spots which need to be rectified. I have obtained details on this. I have instructed completion of these works within 2 months,” Bommai said.The chief minister said he was taking steps to find a permanent solution -- a promise made by several before him. He added that strict orders had been given to the civic body officials to clear encroachments on lakes and SWDs.“About 2626 encroached structures have been identified on Raja Kaluves of which 1,480 have been cleared. Legal action has been initiated for eviction of 714 structures. The operation would be carried out without causing inconvenience for the poor by giving them time, while big builders would be acted on immediately,” Bommai said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/civic-body-draws-up-900cr-estimate-to-fix-drainage-system-to-check-flooding-101637782885001.html
25-11-2021||India||CM Jagan says Andhra suffered ₹6,000 crore loss due to rains||Hyderabad The recent heavy rains in Rayalaseema and south coastal districts of Andhra Pradesh due to a depression in Bay of Bengal resulted in a loss of ₹6,054 crore in the form of destruction of properties and infrastructure, and damage to standing crops. As many as 40 people died in the calamity and another 25 people are still missing, chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy informed the Centre on Wednesday.In a letter written to Union home minister Amit Shah, the chief minister requested that the Centre release ₹1,000 crore towards immediate relief and restoration works in the flood-affected areas.Jagan said four south coastal districts of Krishna, Guntur, Prakasam and Nellore, and four Rayalaseema districts of Kurnool, Anantapur, Kadapa and Chitttoor received an average rainfall of 11.1 cm, against the normal of 3.2 cm, between November 13 and 20.“On a single day on November 19, the highest rainfall of 20 cm was recorded in Peddamandyam block in Chittoor district, 19.3 cm in Galiveedu block of Kadapa district and 17.8 cm in Nallacheruvu block of Ananthapuram district,” he said.Heavy rains also lashed the temple town of Tirupati, Tirumala, Nellore town, Madanapalli and Rajampet town, causing inundation of low-lying areas and disrupting normal life. As many as 17 NDRF and SDRF teams and two helicopters had to be deployed for undertaking search and rescue operations.“Despite their best efforts, 40 people, including one SDRF constable involved in search and rescue operations, died and 25 people are still missing. As many as 1,402 villages in 196 mandals and four towns were affected. As part of relief measures, 324 relief camps accommodating about 69,616 people have been arranged in the affected districts and they are still continuing,” the chief minister said.He pointed out that several highways, irrigation tanks and canals got breached and damaged at several places in Kadapa, Chittoor, Ananthapuram and Nellore districts. Somasila reservoir in Pennar basin received heavy inflows of more than 500,000 cusecs of water during 48 hours causing inundation of low-lying areas in Nellore town and Kovvur in the district.“The Annamayya reservoir in Kadapa district got breached and thus, a railway track between Nandaluru and Hastavaram was badly damaged causing traffic disruption. In Nellore district Swarnamukhi has been in spate with heavy inflows and thus, the road between Kovvur and Nellore town submerged in flood water,” he said.Jagan said heavy rains created havoc in the affected districts as the crops in thousands of acres suffered damage. The worst-affected were the farmers as the crops that were ready for harvesting were damaged. The cost of the crops damaged and loss to infrastructure is estimated at ₹6054.29 crore. He requested the Centre to come to the rescue of the state by immediately releasing ₹1,000 crore as an interim aid so as to provide relief to affected families and restore the normalcy by undertaking repairs and restoration of damaged infrastructure in the affected districts.“I also request you to kindly depute the Inter Ministerial Central Team (IMCT) at the earliest to assess the damage and losses caused by heavy rains,” the chief minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cm-jagan-says-andhra-suffered-6-000-crore-loss-due-to-rains-101637782826093.html

25-11-2021||India||Hours before civic polls, Tripura CPM leader sends SOS message to Supreme Court||AGARTALA: Hours before people in the state’s urban areas vote for new municipal bodies, Tripura’s Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader Jitendra Chaudhary on Wednesday rushed to the Supreme Court to seek its intervention to ensure free and fair civic body elections, CPM leaders said late on Wednesday.Chaudhary also sent a letter to Tripura police chief VS Yadav, alleging that a large number of “outsiders” and “miscreants” have entered areas that are going to vote on Thursday in a continuing effort to terrorise opposition candidates and their supporters.“ ...large number of miscreants are intruding into those areas at the behest of ruling BJP and indulging into terrorising the houses of the opposition supporters with dire consequences, with the threat not to move to the polling stations tomorrow on 25th November 2021,” Chaudhury said in his letter to DGP Yadav.On Tuesday, the Supreme Court rejected the Trinamool Congress request to defer the civic body polls but told the police to submit within two days an action-taken report on incidents of violence in the state ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP.“While we are not inclined to accede to the prayer for postponing polls, we are equally of the view that it is the duty of the director-general of police (DGP), the inspector general of police (IGP – law and order) and the home secretary of the state of Tripura to assuage any misgivings about the fairness of the law enforcement machinery in supporting the electoral process,” a bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and Vikram Nath ruled on Tuesday.In a statement soon after the court ruling, the Tripura police listed the additional steps that were being taken.Opposition parties, however, insist that the police action has fallen short.“There is no reflection of improved law and order in the state even after the Supreme Court directed to ensure a peaceful and fair election,” Trinamool Congress convener Subal Bhowmik told reporters.BJP spokesperson Nabendu Bhattacharya said, “The state has complied with the Supreme Court order and accordingly, proper security arrangement was made. The opposition is making baseless allegations”.The ruling BJP has won 112 seats uncontested out of a total of 334 seats on which elections were to be held. Voting for the remaining 222 local urban body seats will begin from 7am across 644 polling stations. There are 785 candidates in the fray, and over 5.94 lakh people are entitled to vote.Of the total of 644 polling stations, 370 have been identified as ‘ A’ category where four Tripura State Rifles personnel will be deployed. In the remaining 274 ‘B’ category polling stations, four armed police personnel would be stationed.Additionally, two sections of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) are deployed at strong room and government press. All returning officers and observers were provided personal security officers.“After the directions of Hon’ble Supreme Court of India, additional 15 sections of CRPF are also being provided for the Agartala municipal elections and outside,” said a statement from the assistant inspector general of police on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hours-before-civic-polls-tripura-cpm-leader-sends-sos-message-to-supreme-court-101637781985196.html
25-11-2021||India||NFHS survey: Health insurance coverage rises, officials credit Ayushman Bharat||Summary findings from the fifth edition of the National Family Health Survey, released Wednesday showed a 12.3 percentage point increase over the previous edition of the survey in the coverage of health insurance to 41% of households surveyed, an indication of the impact of the government’s flagship Ayuhsman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojna (AB-Pmjay), that was launched in September 2018. AB-Pmjay, the world’s largest public health insurance programme was launched on September 23, 2018, to provide up to ₹5 lakh hospitalisation cover to 100 million poor families in the country.NFHS-5 was conducted between 2019-2021,in two phases; the fourth edition of the survey captured data between 2015-16. “The increase that is seen is substantially on account of the impact of Ayuhsman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojna,” said Vikas Sheel, additional secretary and mission director, National Health Mission, Union ministry of health and family welfare, commenting on the survey results.“However, it may not have been fully captured in the current survey; more impact will be visible in going forward,” he added.Preparations for the next survey are on currently. “The survey will happen in 2022 and the results are expected in 2023-2024, by that time full impact of Pm-jay will be adequately captured as the scheme has now stabilised and various states have taken it up and are addressing the challenges,” added Sheel.Interestingly, coverage in the rural sector is higher at 42.4%, and urban areas, 38.1%. A government official familiar with the numbers said that this is because the target population for the scheme is largely rural. Experts agree that the increase in the insurance coverage is because of the introduction of AB-pmjay.“That is best explanation,” said Dileep Mavalankar, director, Indian Institute of Public Health, Gandhinagar.“However, one needs to also see what is the eligible population under Pm-jay as the coverage might not go up furtheronce the target is met. The government should look at expanding the insurance scheme somehow,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nfhssurvey-health-insurance-coverage-rises-officials-credit-ayushman-bharat-101637781745265.html
25-11-2021||India||Jump in bank accounts operated by women: NFHS survey||There has been significant progress with respect to women operating bank accounts, from 53 per cent to 79 per cent at all-India level, according to findings of phase two of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5).“Women empowerment indicators portray considerable improvement at all India level and across all the phase-II states/UTs (Union territories). Significant progress has been recorded between NFHS-4 and NFHS-5 with regard to women operating bank accounts from 53% to 79% at all-India level,” the health ministry said in a statement.More than 70% of women in every state and Union territory surveyed in the second phase have operational bank accounts, it added. Taking note of the latest development, a finance ministry official said the government is committed to provide financial inclusiveness and support to women, which is a national priority. “This achievement was accomplished because of the government’s key initiatives such as the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojna (PMJDY), which is one of the biggest financial inclusion initiatives in the world, and the Stand Up India Scheme,” the official said on condition of anonymity. The PMJDY was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on August 15, 2014, and was launched on August 28 that year.As on August 18, 2021, the number of total PMJDY accounts stood at over 430 million, where 55.47% (238.7 million) Jan Dhan account holders were women and 66.69% (287 million) Jan Dhan accounts were in rural and semi-urban areas, the official said. Similarly, Stand-Up India Scheme, which was launched on April 5, 2016, to promote entrepreneurship at grass root level for economic empowerment and job creation, has more than 81% (91,109 accounts) with a sanctioned amount of ₹20,749 crore belonging to women entrepreneurs. The objective of this scheme is to facilitate bank loans between ₹10 lakh and ₹1 crore to at least one Scheduled Caste (SC) or Scheduled Tribe (ST) borrower and at least one woman borrower per bank branch of SCBs (scheduled commercial banks) for setting up a greenfield enterprise.The government on Wednesday released factsheets of key indicators on population, reproductive and child health, family welfare, nutrition and others for India as well as 14 states and union territories, clubbed under phase two, of the 2019-21 NFHS-5. The states and UTs which were surveyed in this phase were Arunachal Pradesh, Chandigarh, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, NCT of Delhi, Odisha, Puducherry, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, the statement said.The NFHS-5 survey work has been conducted in around 6.1 lakh sample households from 707 districts (as on March, 2017) of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jump-in-bank-accounts-operated-by-women-nfhs-survey-101637781564950.html
25-11-2021||India||Crypto investors to get exit time if Centre bans trading: Officials||People who hold cryptocurrencies will get time to exit from the unregulated market if the government enacts a law banning their trade or use, but all profit from liquidating these investments will be treated as income or capital gains and will be appropriately taxed, two officials aware of the development said on Wednesday.The government has scheduled the introduction of the “Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021” in the winter session of Parliament with the purpose to “prohibit all private cryptocurrencies in India,” but the bill will have “certain exceptions to promote the underlying technology of cryptocurrency and its uses”. The session starts on November 29.There’s also a school of thought that believes the government could continue to allow cryptocurrencies as an asset class (like mutual funds), not currency.The first person said investors will have ample time to exit if they wish from the time the bill is introduced in the Parliament and then passed by the two houses. Additionally, a three-month buffer is likely to be allowed, beginning from the date a potential ban is enacted.“In fact, people should have taken a cue from RBI’s [Reserve Bank of India] cautionary note issued in 2018; subsequently, a committee under the chairmanship of economic affairs secretary recommended banning private VCs [virtual currencies] in 2019. Perhaps, they took a calculated risk,” this person added, asking not to be named.According to officials, the Bill is still a draft as it needs formal approval by the cabinet before being introduced in the Parliament.RBI on April 6, 2018, pointed to the risks associated with cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and advised banks and other entities under its regulation not to deal with such currencies. The Supreme Court set aside the RBI circular on March 4, 2020.India is among those countries mulling the idea of a central-bank issued digital currency.“Governments world-over are facing issues of terror-financing and money laundering, which could be facilitated by cryptocurrencies. Even (international intergovernmental body) Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has cautioned that virtual currencies can create new opportunities for criminals to launder their proceeds and finance their illicit activities. Hence, private virtual currencies cannot be allowed. But, a reasonable time will be given to people if they want to exit after paying taxes,” a second official said.Naveen Wadhwa, deputy general manager at Taxmann, a tax research and advisory firm said, the applicability of income tax on such investments would depend on several factors -- whether the assessee is a broker or an investor.For an investor, based on the holding period, the income can be classified as short-term profit or long-term capital gains. Hence, different tax rates will be applicable.“On short-term capital gains, appropriate income tax slab will be applicable, which could go up to 30%, plus surcharge. If income is classified as long-term capital gains, the applicable rate would be 20% plus surcharge,” he said.SR Patnaik, head-taxation at law firm Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas said: “The gains accrued to an individual investor may either be regarded as business income or as capital gains depending on how they have been recorded and the purposes for which such investment was made.”“In case the investor acquired cryptocurrencies for speculative purposes or with an intention to trade in them and make money, they may be regarded as business income. However, if the investment was made with the intention of making gains from the long term appreciation, then such gains may be taxed as capital gains,” he said.Alternatively, the entire amount of gains may be taxed at the highest rate as income from other sources, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/crypto-investors-to-get-exit-time-if-centre-bans-trading-officials-101637781452784.html
25-11-2021||India||Bombay HC rejects Tejpal’s plea for in-camera hearing of appeal against acquittal||The Bombay High Court at Goa on Wednesday rejected an application filed by Tarun Tejpal seeking that the hearing of the appeal be held ‘in-camera’ and out of public view after hearing substantive arguments by Advocate Amit Desai on behalf of Tejpal and a rebuttal by the prosecution that was represented by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta. “For reasons that we will be recording separately in writing, the application is rejected,” a bench of Justices Revati Mohite Dere and MS Jawalkar, said. Tejpal, has, however, via his counsel indicated that he would prefer to appeal against the ruling.Tejpal had filed an application claiming relief under section 327(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which mandates that “the inquiry into and trial of rape or an offence under section 376, section 376A, section 376B, section 376C or section 376D of the Indian Penal Code shall be conducted in camera.”Advocate Desai argued that an appeal fell within the ambit of the definition of an ‘enquiry’ and hence was covered under the definition of article 327 of the code of criminal procedure (CrPC). “The identity of an accused in an appeal is equally required to be protected. Article 327 (of CrPC) becomes a facet of article 21 (of the constitution) (Right to life). Article 327 is intended to protect the reputation of the complainant and the accused. Reputation is a fundamental right and no longer (just) a statutory obligation,” Desai argued. On the other hand, Solicitor General Advocate Tushar Mehta, who argued for the state of Goa, which has appealed against Tejpal’s acquittal, argued that such a request was beyond the scope of Article 327 of the CrPC. “The appeal is neither an inquiry nor a trial. After the judgement is passed, the trial ends. Article 327 is limited to an inquiry and a trial,” Mehta argued. Mehta argued that with the conclusion of the trial and pronouncement of judgement, which is in public domain the accused, if acquitted, was free to assail his accuser with there being no legal bar. Similarly, if convicted, would suffer damage to his reputation. However, after freely availing of opportunity to comment on the verdict, the accused could not, after he files an appeal, seek to demand that the appeal be held in camera. Tejpal sought time to appeal against the verdict and asked for the matter to be adjourned until the next date. The matter has now been posted for December 6.Earlier the High Court had indicated that it would not, “at this stage” be hearing Tejpal’s application for an in-camera hearing. However, on Wednesday, Desai urged the court to decide the application before hearing the application for ‘leave to appeal’. At Desai’s instance, the High Court agreed to hear the application.The former editor of Tehelka magazine was accused of raping a junior colleague in an elevator of a five-star hotel in Goa during the THiNK festival in November 2013. The complainant alleged that Tejpal had raped her in a lift in the hotel on November 7 and attempted to assault her again on November 8. Tejpal, who refuted the charges in court, was acquitted by the fast-track court on May 21.The judge in her judgement gave Tejpal, who is facing charges under sections 376 (rape), 354A (sexual harassment), 354B (criminal assault with intent to disrobe a woman), 341 (wrongful restraint) and 342 (wrongful confinement) of the Indian Penal Code, the benefit of doubt and acquitted him on account of lack of sufficient evidence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bombay-hc-rejects-tejpal-s-plea-for-in-camera-hearing-of-appeal-against-acquittal-101637781445147.html
25-11-2021||India||ACB raids: ₹13.5L seized from pipe at govt staff’s residence in Karnataka||Officials of the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) on Wednesday had to use a bucket to drain out ₹13.50 lakh in cash, stuffed inside the waterpipe of Public Works Department (PWD) junior engineer Shanta Gouda, during a raid in Kalaburgi district. They also recovered ₹15 lakh in cash from the ceiling of the house. In all, they seized more than ₹55 lakh from his residence. According to officials, Gouda didn’t answer the door for 15 minutes even as the team was continuously knocking on the door. They found that during this time Gouda and his son were stashing cash into the wash basin outlet. After gaining entry, they had to cut open the pipe and confiscate the cash. The anti-corruption agency conducted simultaneous search operations at 68 locations related to 15 government officials, said a brief statement from the department. The ACB searched houses, offices, and residences across Mangaluru, Bengaluru, Mandya, Kalburgi, among others, the ACB added. The raids were conducted on the heels of an ongoing operation at the headquarters and other offices of the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) in Bengaluru. More than 300 ACB staff, including eight Superintendent of Police rank officers, took part in the massive raids. Among those who were raided was Karnataka Administrative Service (KAS) official LC Nagaraj, out on bail after he was arrested in July 2019 for his alleged involvement in the I-Monetary Advisor (IMA) ponzi scam case in 2019The IMA scam pertains to over ₹4,000 crores collected by the IMA Group from over 100,000 investors in the name of providing attractive returns on investment following Islamic ways. IMA was an investment banking company run by Mahommed Mansoor Khan, who claimed it was a sharia-compliant operation run on Islamic principles and which took huge deposits primarily from members of the Muslim community. When IMA stopped paying dividends in March 2019, investors lodged complaints with the police and in June 2019, the Karnataka government set up an SIT to investigate the more than 51,500 complaints that had been filed by investors. A special investigation team (SIT) probing the scam arrested Nagaraj he was the assistant commissioner (Bengaluru North), charging him with taking a bribe of ₹4.5 crores to submit a favourable report on Khan’s company. Official supervising the raid said that ACB found gold, cash, and other valuables at the KAS officer’s house in Bengaluru. The raid is still underway, and Nagaraj is yet to produce documentation for the seized articles, the officer said. “We can’t disclose the value of the property that has been seized. During the raids, we have found valuables that could run into several lakhs of rupees, especially gold ornaments. The officer has claimed he purchased them taking big loans, but he is yet to produce relevant documents. Also, we have found that he was using Benamis (proxies), he will have to explain those assets as well,” said the officer, who did not want to be named. In the Gadag district, ACB officials unearthed around 7kg of gold worth ₹3.5 crores and ₹15 lakh cash at the residence of TS Rudreshappa, joint director, agriculture department, Gadag. The ACB also seized assets (moveable and immovable) to the tune of ₹13 crores from the premises of Mayanna M, a first division clerk Major Roads and Infrastructure at Bengaluru civic body BBMP. “Even he has used several Benami properties registered to his wife, mother-in-law and some friends. We have raided four locations related to Mayanna. He is yet to provide explanations for the disproportionate assets. Legal proceedings will be followed,” the officer added. Mayanna, in his statement to ACB, disassociated himself from the person who ACB alleged to be his proxies, said ACB. However, Umadevi, one of the alleged associates of Mayanna, said she was known to Mayanna but did not have any financial transactions with him. Umadevi is alleged to be a proxy for Mayanna. “He (Mayanna) has been targeted because they (unspecified) fear that he would become bigger than them. He recently participated in the Sahitya Parishat election. So, raid against him me (?) an attempt to target those who are close to Mayanna. We have not done anything illegal… I have been living with my son since my husband died 20 years ago,” said Umadevi. ACB officials said all 15 officials were raided based on specific information about them collecting bribes. In another case, Rajashekar, who worked as a physiotherapist at Yelahanka government hospital, has purchased three BDA sites, two revenue sites besides five acres of land in Doddaballapur taluk near Bengaluru. Most of the purchases were made during and post Covid pandemic. In a statement, the ACB said the raids were conducted on the properties of KS Lingegowda, (Executive Engineer, Mangaluru Smart City Limited), Lakshminarashimaiah (Revenue Inspector at Doddaballapur), Srinivas K (Executive Engineer of Hemavati Left Bank Canal (HLBC)), Vasudev (former project manager of Nirmiti Kendra) and others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/acb-raids-13-5l-seized-from-pipe-at-govt-staff-s-residence-in-karnataka-101637781384954.html
25-11-2021||India||Domestic, sexual violence rising in state: NFHS data||The National Family Health Survey (NFHS) 5, released on Wednesday, points to rising instances of domestic and sexual violence against women in the state. The survey shows that married women, between the ages of 18-49, who have ever experienced spousal violence, has more than doubled from 20.6 in 2014-15 to 44.5%.The rise of spousal violence among pregnant married women has come down marginally from 6.5 in 2014-15 to 5.8. Young women (18-29), who have experienced sexual violence by age 18, has risen from 10.3 in 2014-15 to 11.0, data shows, indicating to a higher instances of domestic and sexual violence during the Covid-19 pandemic-induced lockdowns.The survey was carried out from July 10, 2019 to December 11, 2019 by Nielsen India which gathered information from 26,574 households -- 30,455 women and 4,516 men.“This is definitely quite a dramatic increase and from what we understand, these kinds of situations have only worsened in the context of Covid,” Dr Adithya Pradyumna, faculty member, Azim Premji University told Hindustan Times on Wednesday.The survey paints a contrasting picture of the recently released National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data that shows a decrease in crimes against women in 2020.According to the NCRB data, Karnataka saw a reduction in cases of crime against women registered in the state from 13,514 in 2018 and 13,828 cases in 2019 which reduced to 12,680 in 2020. A case of assault on a woman with intent to outrage her modesty was recorded the most in the state. 4,751 cases were registered under the section which amount to sexual harassment, HT reported on September 16.Data from the NFHS also show that issues like obesity have been on the rise among adult male and females.The Karnataka fact sheet of key indicators shows that women who are overweight (as a percentage) have gone up from 22.3 in 2014-15 to 30.1 among women and from 22.1 to 30.9 among men between the ages of 15-49.Even in the indicators that have seen positive developments, there appears to be a stark contrast among regions with several districts of north-eastern Karnataka, among the most backward in the state, showing significantly less improvement but the average going up as some of the more prosperous southern districts raise the average of the state.The contrast is ominous as it emphasises on the rising regional imbalance in Karnataka where prosperity and promise of one region balances out abject poverty of millions by the law of averages.For instance, the per capita income of the Bengaluru region in 2018-19 stood at ₹301,748 as against the Kalaburagi division, which includes six of some of the most backward districts in the country, at ₹114,133, data from the state economic survey show.The Belagavi division or Kittur-Karnataka region (earlier known as Mumbai-Karnataka) has a per capita income of ₹128,761 as against Mysuru division which stands at ₹205,829.However, the average of the state’s per capita income (at current prices) saw a rise to ₹226,796 in 2020-21, registering a 1.6% increase as against ₹223,175 the previous year, shouldered by the revenues earned largely by Bengaluru’s vibrant technology, aerospace, biotechnology and startup ecosystem.Dr Pradyumna also points to the growing costs for delivery of a child at public healthcare facilities.The average out-of-pocket expenditure per delivery in a public health facility has increased from ₹4,824 in 2014-15 to ₹5,042 in 2019-20, NFHS data shows.Rising cost of healthcare in public facilities indicates a larger problem of corruption, restricting access to subsidised healthcare and recurring costs associated with them.“The fact that people have to spend that much money itself is a matter of concern. If people are reporting that they are spending almost ₹5,000 for a delivery is a matter of concern that too in a public facility. This shows that public facilities that should ideally be giving fully subsidised care, especially for things such as delivery, people are spending around ₹5,000 and there needs to be some further studies on where these expenses are being incurred,” he said.A recent study by the Azim Premji University, released in November, shows that healthcare has a disproportionate burden on the poor, especially those living in urban areas. “Our evidence from Bengaluru shows that 30% of even the poorest quintile seek delivery care from private sources. Since there is a 10-fold difference in cost between public and private facilities, this significantly adds to their financial burden,” the report by AZU shows.The emphasis on health insurance with union government schemes like Ayushman Bharat too appears not to have the desired impact, NFHS data shows. Households with any usual member covered under a health insurance or financing scheme remain stagnant at 28.1 as compared to the 2014-15.“There seems to have been some focus on Ayushman Bharat and other sorts of insurance schemes but for whatever reason the proportion of households that are covered with insurance seems to have remained stagnant,” Dr Pradyumna said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/domestic-sexual-violence-rising-in-state-nfhs-data-101637781327387.html

He was hoping to help his family with the returns but his fortunes had better plans.Shariff struck gold, literally as one of the containers that he purchased had around 13 kg of the precious metal that had been trapped in one of the containers.Shariff’s first daughter was born on that day and life has never been the same for the person now known by different names and characters he supposedly dons.Babu, the proprietor of Umrah Developers, named after his first born, has been chosen as the Congress’ choice for the December 10 MLC polls from Bengaluru Urban. Babu has declared assets worth around ₹1,743 crore that makes him the richest legislator in Karnataka, if not in the country.“I was inspired by Amitabh Bachchan’s role in the movie ‘Trishul’ in which he starts Shanti Construction. He also is first breaking boulders, becomes a big man, buys private land and becomes big (in the movie). I did it in the same style,” he told a Kannada news channel in August.Shariff claims all his businesses are legitimate and he only buys properties that are auctioned by various high courts in the country as he is afraid of being cheated by others since he is not educated.Shariff had first tried to run a bakery, and then drove an auto, worked in construction before entering the scrap business.The 54-year-old, the first of 14 children, studied till 5th standard but cannot read or write in any language but has grown to become a big name in Bengaluru. He resurfaced into the spotlight after one of his cars, a Rolls Royce, was among the several high-end cars seized by police from near upmarket Church Street over unpaid taxes.Babu had told reporters that he had purchased the car from Bollywood icon Amitabh Bachchan but could not complete the transfer of paperwork. Babu had, during his interview, claimed that he amassed over ₹4,000 crore and pays around ₹130 crore in taxes depending on income.He had even proudly said he wears a Rolex Gold and Diamond studded watch valued at ₹1.07 crore. He has liabilities of over ₹67.24 crore.He has 12 bank accounts with a balance of over ₹16.87 crore. He has claimed to own 1 Rolls Royce costing over ₹2.1 crore and two Toyota Fortuner’s that cost ₹49 lakh each. But he has been accused of fraud, cheating, intimidation and his premises have been raided by the income tax department in the past.In April 2019, when he was called in for questioning by the Central Crime Branch (CCB) on charges of selling land with fake documents, stabbed himself with a pair of scissors and had famously said he would “shut down the CCB”.In his affidavit, Shariff said he was raided by the income tax over dues of ₹13.43 crore. “I have preferred an appeal before the Commissioner of Income Tax and the same is admitted. The hearing of the case is yet to be done,” he said in the affidavit.He has at least seven criminal cases pending against him under various sections by his own declaration.Congress Karnataka unit president DK Shivakumar had declared assets of ₹840 crore in 2018 just before the assembly election. M Nagaraju (MTB), the BJP legislator, is worth in excess of ₹1,201 crore (along with his wife) and is the one of the richest legislators in the country, at least in terms of declared amount.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-candidate-in-karnataka-mlc-polls-declares-assets-worth-1-743-crore-101637781326270.html
25-11-2021||India||Gujarat govt called Army on time to control riots: SIT to SC||The Narendra Modi government in Gujarat took a timely decision to call the Army on the day riots broke out on February 28, 2002 and, on the same day, deployment commenced, said the Supreme Court-appointed Special Investigation Team (SIT) on Wednesday.Defending the clean chit given to then Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi and 63 others in the larger conspiracy probe undertaken by the SIT on a complaint by Zakia Ehsan Jafri, whose husband former Congress MP Eshan Jafri died during the riots, the SIT told the Court that the presence of state Ministers in the police control room on the day of riots was to possibly boost the morale of the police. It further argued that calling SIT partisan was unfair as its investigation into the nine riot cases led to arrest and conviction of a sitting state minister Maya Kodnani and addition of several other accused whose role was not examined by the Gujarat Police.After SIT was entrusted by the top court in 2011 to examine Jafri’s complaint, it filed a closure report on February 8, 2012 finding no substance in the larger conspiracy angle. The magistrate dismissed Jafri’s petition challenging the SIT report ; the Gujarat high court too in October 2017 refused to admit her appeal. The appeal against this order is presently being heard by a three-judge bench of the top court headed by justice AM Khanwilkar.Opening arguments for SIT, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi said, “A large part of the complaint is general and not worthy of investigation. But the SIT culled out 30 allegations and investigated every aspect, examining 275 witnesses. Much time was spent on it since it was the mandate from the highest court.” He further stated that the SIT was not to probe “everything under the sun” as its remit was limited to finding out additional material on which other accused could be charge sheeted.Dismissing every allegation of inaction leveled against it by Jafri’s lawyer senior advocate Kapil SIbal, the SIT began by denying parading of dead bodies of Godhra train burning incident of February 27, 2002 (this was alleged by the petitioner to be the trigger point that sparked riots). “There was no question of parading the bodies. It was a serious issue that could add fuel to the fire. We examined all persons and found no substance as bodies moved under police escort,” Rohatgi said.On the role of the state officials, Rohatgi said, “A decision was taken by the Chief Minister to call the Army on February 28. It is a false allegation that army was called in late. The fax was sent at 2 pm and the army was redeployed in the night itself. The PM had to give his approval to move the army because of the tension after the Parliament attack (in December 2001). But there was no delay.” He added that the last unit of the Army landed on March 1.Sibal relied upon a statement by Lt. Gen. Zameer Uddin Shah who wrote a book in 2018 alleging that the army’s deployment was delayed due to lack of transportation by the state leading to so many deaths. Rohatgi said, “A public notice was issued in April 2008 asking members of public to come forward and depose before SIT. What stopped him from coming to SIT? His statement is irrelevant as there is no purpose of writing a book in 2018.”On the Tehelka sting tapes (recordings made during a sting operation by magazine Tehelka) , used as evidence to prosecute accused in some of the riots cases, Rohatgi said, “There is no dispute about its genuineness of the tapes. But the statements inspire no confidence. SIT found no substance to lodge charge sheet but we still gave it to the trial court in three riots cases. One particular court rejected the material produced in the sting tapes.”Rohatgi explained to the Court that the remit of SIT was of limited scope. “My remit under SC order was to see whether there is material against people who are not already accused and whether charge sheet must be filed against other accused. I am not a super-police station that I will investigate everything under the sun.”SIT also alleged that the copy of Jafri’s original complaint produced before Supreme Court was “doctored” and Rohatgi showed discrepancies with the complaint SIT received in 2011. He pointed out that the complaint copiously relied on statements made by two police officials during the riots – Sanjiv Bhat and RB Sreekumar, but not a word of it was argued in the present proceedings. Bhat was sacked from the police force and Sreekumar turned against the state government after he was superseded in 2005, he argued. Rohatgi said, “We left no stone unturned because SC had asked us to investigate. Somebody may agree or disagree with us but it is very unfair to say SIT did not do its job.” Rohatgi will continue with arguments on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gujarat-govt-called-army-on-time-to-control-riots-sit-to-sc-101637781090977.html
25-11-2021||India||Woman reunited with baby after DNA test||After a month-long battle, former Left student leader Anupama S Chandran and her husband Ajith Kumar on Wednesday were reunited with their one-year-old son, who was forcibly given away for adoption by her parents who disapproved of her marriage.The Kerala State Council for Child Welfare Committee handed over the child after a family court was informed that DNA tests on the infant, Chandran and Kumar had established the couple as his parents. “I am happy I got my baby back. Really indebted to all those who supported me. I will continue my struggle till officials who were part of this trafficking are punished,” Anupama told reporters outside the office of the Kerala State Council for Child Welfare Committee, where she had been staging a protest for the last 10 days.The child had been under the care and protection of his adoptive parents in Andhra Pradesh till last Sunday. Daughter of CPI-M leader S Jayachandran, Anupama had alleged last month that her parents had taken away her three-day-old son a year ago and put him up for adoption as they did not approve of her marriage with a Dalit man. During the court proceedings at 2.30 pm, Child Welfare Committee (CWC) submitted the results of the DNA test which was conducted at Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology (RGCB). During the one-and-a-half hour long proceedings held in the chamber of the judge K Biju Menon, the baby, who was in the custody of CWC at Nirmala Sishu Bhavan, was also produced before the court as per its directive. The court then directed that the baby be medically examined and after completing all legal formalities, ordered the CWC to hand over the child to his mother. It also ordered that all adoption proceedings in this regard be dropped. “Since the biological mother has come forward to receive the child, the adoption proceedings should be dropped and summarily dismissed,” the judge said. The court had posted the matter for hearing on November 30, but rescheduled the hearing to Wednesday after the state government pleader appealed to hand over the baby to its parents at the earliest. Anupama’s parents refused to comment on the court order but said “they did everything with the knowledge of the party and their daughter”. CPI(M) leaders did not react to the court order till the time of going to press. Welcoming the court order, Revolutionary Marxist Party leader and Vadakara MLA K K Rema said: “It is a historic day. The government and powerful party had to bend its knees before a mother. It is a victory for motherhood.” Opposition leader V D Satheesan asked the state government not to protect officials who played a key role in the matter. “It is ideal for the government to dismiss officials of the child welfare council who were part of a criminal conspiracy,” he said. In the second week of October, Anupama claimed that her newborn baby was forcibly taken by her father, a senior leader of the CPI(M) trade union wing CITU, on the third day of delivery and handed over to the Kerala State Council for Child Welfare (SCCW)-run orphanage last year. The child was later given up for adoption in a hurry, in violation of several rules, she alleged. With her father holding an influential position in the CPI(M), she alleged that she approached the local police station, DGP, child welfare committee and party leaders but justice was not delivered.The woman’s father, however, maintained that the baby was born out of wedlock and hence, shifted to a government-run children’s home with Anupama’s consent. While he claimed his daughter had signed on stamp paper, Anupama later said she signed under duress.On October 20, police filed a complaint against six people, including her parents, on the basis of her statement.The issue kicked up a row as several writers and left intellectuals sought the intervention of chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, who described the case as a “family affair”. Anupama then staged a protest in front of the Kerala Secretariat, demanding to return her ‘missing’ son. Ajith also protested outside the Secretariat.Later, Anupama started an indefinite strike outside the Kerala Child Welfare Committee office here.As the issue turned controversial, Kerala health minister Veena George ordered the Women and Child Development Department to investigate the matter.After the family court ordered to bring back the child from his adoptive parents in Andhra Pradesh and conduct a DNA test, child welfare committee officials brought the child to Thiruvananthapuram and a DNA test was conducted. Anupama said she and her husband may plan a trip later if the Andhra couple wanted to see the baby again. “I feel bad for them. Officials cheated them,” she said. Social activist and writer Dr J Devika said: “It is a victory of a mother over power and stubbornness.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/anupama-husband-ajith-reunited-with-baby-after-dna-test-confirms-parentage-101637781088662.html
25-11-2021||India||Supreme Court revives construction ban across Delhi-NCR||The Supreme Court on Wednesday said controlling pollution in the national capital should not be left to “an act of God”, directing the Union government to instead devise a scientific model, based on seasons and wind conditions, for taking all remedial and urgent steps in anticipation of the air quality. The bench also reimposed the ban on construction activities in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR), while allowing some ancillary non-polluting works like plumbing and electrical fitting. The ban on construction activities in NCR was lifted on November 22 in view of the improved air quality. In its order uploaded late of Wednesday night, the top court, however, decided to reinforce the prohibition till further orders. It also directed the state governments of Delhi, Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh to utilise the corpus of labour cess for paying wages to construction workers during suspension of activities. “There has to be a statistical model for Delhi. This is the national capital. Imagine the kind of signals we are sending to the world. You have to have a system in anticipation of how the weather is going to be. Ad hoc measures will not be good enough,” said a bench, headed by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana, as it heard a public interest litigation on air pollution in Delhi-NCR.“You have to have a scientific model based on seasons and wind directions which can reasonably be predicted by the metrological department. You have super computers now. You prepare a statistical model based on these inputs which will indicate the expected levels of pollution. Then you can take measures on the basis of this model. Why do Delhiites have to suffer severe or very poor level of pollution at all?” the bench, which also included justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and Surya Kant observed.The bench then directed the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in Delhi-NCR and Adjoining Areas, which works under the Centre, to engage expert agencies with domain knowledge in meteorological data and statistical modelling and carry out a scientific study of air quality within a month, following which it would submit a report in the court. The directions came as solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the central government, took the bench through various steps taken by the CAQM in Delhi-NCR and Adjoining Areas in the last one week to control the rising levels of pollution. He narrated measures including closure of thermal power plants, ban on old vehicles and use of road cleaning machines and sprinklers. The SG, however, conceded that the improvement in the pollution level could be chiefly attributed to a change in wind direction since November 21.“So, we are saved because of the wind... we are dependent on an act of God. But we cannot go only by wind directions or Met department or act of God. Tell us what major steps you have taken,” the bench asked Mehta, who said that the prediction is that pollution levels will go downward over the next few days and that the situation will be reviewed by the Commission after three days.To this, the bench retorted: “This is all ad hoc. The Commission has to conduct a scientific study. Now, when we know the wind direction for the next seven days, there has to be a statistical model that if this is going to be the wind direction for the next few days, what should be the steps taken to improve the situation.”The bench added: “Suddenly you start road cleaning machines, sprinkling water etc. but all that will not help in long term. The problem is that there is no scientific study done. Nature is given. You cannot do anything about the wind pattern. So, you have to devise a graded response based on the statistical model. Somebody has to conduct a study and propose measures. It has to be science based. It can’t be ad hoc.”Mehta pointed out that there is a Supreme Court-approved Graded Response Action Plan (Grap), which provides for some immediate measures as soon as the pollution level reaches severe-plus.“As you are suggesting, under the graded response plan, we wait for the weather to become severe for two days and then steps are taken. What you need to do is to have a system where you must act in anticipation of what the weather is going to be in next few days. You have weather predictions and other relevant information. Why should we reach such levels at all?” the bench asked the SG.Mehta responded that under the Grap, pollution levels have been classified in different categories – severe, very poor, and so on.“You should be able to figure out what the standard pollution levels for Delhi will be in different weathers. You have to have a scientific model for different seasons for Delhi,” responded the bench.Delhi and the National Capital Region, in an annual winter rerun, has been in the grip of hazardous air pollution as a toxic smog lingers over the Capital and its adjoining cities, leading to a public health emergency. This November has also seen the number of farm fires reaching a new high with the enforcement of a ban on the practice collapsing.The city’s pollution levels on Wednesday began to worsen as winds weakened. The air quality index (AQI) was “poor” on Tuesday - for the first time since November 1 - with a reading of 290 recorded, according to the Central Pollution Control Board’s 4pm bulletin. The AQI shot up to 361 — in the “very poor” category — at 4pm on Wednesday.The bench told Mehta that the mobile phone of one of the judges on the bench showed that the AQI was 350-plus and not 280, as was cited by the law officer. “There also some reports that the situation will become bad again after the evening today,” added the court. Mehta responded that the authorities will review the situation again after three days.At this point, the CJI told Mehta that the top court would not let go of this 2020 PIL without examining the issues thoroughly. The bench asked Mehta to continue with the restrictive measures for the next few days, fixing November 29 as the next date of hearing.Senior advocate Vikas Singh, who appeared for the 17-year-old petitioner, Aditya Dubey, appealed to the court to also deal with the problem of stubble burning, which, he said, could be a seasonal problem but chokes Delhi-NCR during the pre-winter weeks. Singh said that farmers have to incentivised if farm fires have to come down.The bench replied that it was currently focusing on immediate measures to control air pollution and that a full-fledged discussion would be required on the issue of farm fires. “We wonder if there is any study on how much stubble has been removed from the fields and how much subsidies and incentives have been given to the farmers,” added the bench.As the SG said that he would welcome a deliberation on the issue, the bench replied: “As a government lawyer and judges, we are discussing all this here. What has been the bureaucracy doing for all these years? Why can’t they sit with each other, visit fields, meet farmers and come up with something? Anyway, you continue with your steps as we are currently focusing on immediate measures.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-revives-construction-ban-across-delhincr-101637780965282.html
25-11-2021||India||Keen on quick resumption of flight services with India: UAE envoy||The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is keen on speedy restoration of normal air services with India as the lack of adequate flights is posing difficulties for travellers and has led to a spike in air fares, UAE ambassador Ahmed AlBanna said on Wednesday. Under the air bubble arrangement worked out by the two countries following the Covid-19 pandemic, Emirates and Etihad, the flag carriers of the UAE, are currently operating at 30% of their total capacity under the normal air services agreement. This is affecting traffic and the price of a return ticket has increased to almost ₹200,000 from the pre-pandemic rate of around ₹80,000 to ₹90,000. Besides going back to the air services agreement, which will result in the doubling of traffic, the two countries should look at increasing capacity under the pact, AlBanna told a group of reporters. The UAE has also asked the Indian government to exempt flights to the emirates from restrictions for the duration of the Dubai Expo 2020, which will continue till March next year, but is yet to get a “green light”, he said. The UAE is home to more three million Indian expatriates, the largest ethnic community in the emirates comprising professionals and blue-collar workers and their families. The demand for flights has increased as a growing number of Indians are making their way back to the UAE. Dubai also serves as a key transit point for Indians travelling to other parts of the world. AlBanna noted the total weekly capacity for Dubai alone under the air services agreement was about 65,000 seats, while only 24,000 seats are currently available. The frequency of flights on the Delhi-Dubai route has dropped from five a week to three a week, he said. A clause in the air services agreement of 2007 mandates that when capacity on routes between the UAE and India touches 80%, new quotas to be shared between carriers of both countries should be re-negotiated. AlBanna noted that Indian carriers had reached 100% capacity before the pandemic. “At that time, there were at 1,068 flights a week, with around 400-plus flights by the UAE carriers and over 500 by the Indian ones. We need to re-negotiate,” he said. Two rounds of talks held in Mumbai in 2017 and New Delhi in 2019 had not been “successful in reaching a final decision on increasing capacities for the four sectors of Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah and Ras Al Khaimah”, he said. It would be to India’s benefit to end the air bubble, go back to the air services agreement and open all airports once travel restrictions are eased further, the envoy added. AlBanna said the UAE and India had recently concluded the second round of negotiations on a proposed comprehensive economic partnership agreement (CEPA) in Dubai and a third round will be held soon. Though the two sides are eyeing the completion of negotiations by March next year, AlBanna said: “I want it before March. Hopefully it will be in place. The CEPA will be a big plus point in our strategic partnership.” Referring to the first virtual meeting of the foreign ministers of India, Israel, the US and the UAE last month, AlBanna said the four countries had no plans to create a NATO-like alliance. “That doesn’t make any sense. It is an economic bloc that concentrates on economic and business collaboration between the four countries,” he said. Technical teams from the four sides are preparing for an in-person ministerial meeting. “Very soon, once that is done, the ministers will meet to discuss further sectors [of cooperation],” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/keen-on-quick-resumption-of-flight-services-with-india-uae-envoy-101637780906200.html
25-11-2021||India||Navy leak case: CBI files charge sheet against 2 commanders||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has filed a fresh charge sheet in the naval leak case against a retired Indian Navy officer as well as three serving ones, people familiar with the matter said. Those named in the latest charge sheet filed on Saturday, the third in the case so far, include Commanders Jagdish, Abhishek Shaw, and Ajeet Pandey and retired Commodore Randeep Singh. The retired officer was named in the first charge sheet filed by CBI and Pandey in the second, both filed on November 2. People familiar with the development said the four are accused of leaking confidential information related to advance payments in the INS Sindhuratna-MRLC project. The Major Refit and Life Certification programme envisaged spending up to ₹5,000 crore, HT has learnt. The espionage racket came to the light on September 2 when the agency raided and arrested Randeep Singh and another retired Commander SJ Singh (who too was named in the first charge sheet). The agency said it recovered ₹2 crore from Randeep Singh. Apart from the two, it also arrested on the same day, Pandey and another serving officer who was not named, and two other people who were also not named. Officials who did not want to be named said all six accused persons were granted bail last week by a Delhi court . Three executives from Hyderabad based Allen Reinforced Plastics, NB Rao, TP Shastri, and K Chandrasekhar, were also named in the second charge sheet. It was initially believed that confidential information about the upgrade of the Russian-origin Kilo-class submarines was leaked by the accused. However, the CBI probe found that information related to at least three more projects may have been compromised. The CBI probe found retired and serving Navy officials conspired to share “secret information of internal files for processing and passing of tender related to procurement and maintenance in different Indian Naval offices with the favoured firms/companies”. The agency has questioned several persons in the case and further investigation into the leak of information on other projects is going on.  CBI has approached the Centre for its approval for invoking stringent Official Secrets Act (OSA) against the accused as the probe has found that classified information was leaked. OSA provides for imprisonment of up to 14 years, where the offence is committed in relation to any work of defence, arsenal, naval, military or air force establishment or station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/navy-leak-case-cbi-files-charge-sheet-against-2-commanders-101637780605002.html
25-11-2021||India||Supreme Court seeks Centre, IITs reply over plea on quota for faculty recruitment||The Supreme Court on Wednesday sought a response from the Centre and all Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) on a plea over inadequate reservation for faculty members and research degree programmes.The petition, filed by geothermal energy researcher Sachichida Nand Pandey, claimed that the representation of scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and other backward classes was way below the prescribed percentage of 15%, 7.5% and 27% respectively.A bench of justices L Nageswara Rao, BR Gavai and BV Nagarathna asked the petitioner’s lawyer to examine the issue based on the 2019 law passed by Parliament, which provides for reservation for SC, ST and OBC in teacher cadre in central educational institutions, IITs being one among them.Advocate Ashwani Kumar Dubey, appearing for the petitioner, urged for a mechanism to be put in place for resolving complaints by students/scholars alleging harassment and to have a committee of technical experts to review the performance of the existing faculty, besides adopting a transparent recruitment policy.The bench agreed to consider only one prayer asking the IITs to follow the reservation policy in admission in research degree programmes and recruitment of faculty at the institute.As per data collected by the petitioner, out of 3,581 faculty posts in 11 leading IITs, the faculty strength belonging to SCs was 68, STs was 10 and OBCs 194. “The respondents are not following the guidelines of reservation as per the constitutional mandate,” the petition said.In June 2008, a letter was addressed by the ministry of education to the Directors of IITs at Kharagpur, Madras, Bombay, Roorkee and Guwahati asking them to implement reservation for SC, ST and OBCs in teaching posts at the assistant professor level in science and technology and all levels in humanities and management department.In November 2019, the petition added, the Centre extended reservation to all posts (associate professors and professors) in all streams, including technical or faculty positions. Quoting news reports, the petition said that between 2015 and 2019, IITs admitted 2.1% STs, 9.1% SCs and 23.2% OBCs as research scholars.The petition also raised the rising suicides cases among students in IITs and linked the issue to the poor quality of teaching, supervision, caste and racial harassment that students have to undergo at these institutions. It pointed out that faculty members belonging to north, central and Hindi speaking states are low in the IITs which is an added factor of discrimination in the recruitment policy adopted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-seeks-centre-iits-reply-over-plea-on-quota-for-faculty-recruitment-101637780486235.html
25-11-2021||India||Centre writes to states, UTs over drop in Covid testing||The Union health ministry has directed 11 states and two Union territories to increase Covid-19 testing amid concerns over declining weekly testing rates and spiking positivity rates in some districts.In a letter to the states and Union territories on Tuesday, Union secretary for health and family welfare Rajesh Bhushan stressed on maintaining high testing rates given the recent increase in travelling due to events like marriages, festivals and vacations that have recently concluded or are underway.The letter was addressed to the governments of Nagaland, Sikkim, Maharashtra, Kerala, Goa, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Rajasthan, West Bengal and Ladakh. It also mentioned state-specific testing details of particular districts and positivity rates.“While there has been a significant decline in new cases with 10,195 average daily cases reported in the week ending 22nd November, it has been observed that there has also been a decline in weekly testing rates,” Bhushan said.Citing multiple surges in Covid-19 cases in several countries, the health secretary said: “In the absence of sustained levels of sufficient testing, it is very difficult to determine the true level of infection spread in a geography. With a majority of countries seeing multiple surges in Covid cases in recent times and a few developed countries facing even fourth and fifth waves despite high levels of Covid vaccination, there is a need for continued vigil, given the unpredictable and contagious nature of the disease.”A decrease in testing would undermine the actual infection spread within the community, he added.With the onset of winter and increased pollution in some states, the health ministry also directed them to closely monitor the prevalence of respiratory distress symptoms, influenza like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI), with tests being conducted regularly for timely monitoring and clustering of cases for early hotspot identification,“…we will be able to maintain the momentum and build on the progress made so far to bring the pandemic situation under control. Ministry of Health and Family Welfare assures of any requisite support to the state in the ongoing and collective efforts against Covid-19,” Bhushan said.Experts also believe that increasing testing is the key to curb the rate of Covid-19 infection.“Tracking, testing and treating is crucial to bring down the rate of infection. Increasing testing will help identify positive cases which otherwise may go unnoticed and might infect many others within the community. It’s scientifically established that testing and isolating positive cases works effectively in breaking the transmission chain,” Jacob John, former virology head of Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-writes-to-states-uts-over-drop-in-covid-testing-101637780424929.html
25-11-2021||India||Former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh in Chandigarh, may join probe||Former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh is in Chandigarh, and likely to join an ongoing corruption and extortion probe in Maharashtra soon, said a person aware of developments on Wednesday.Singh, who is facing five separate charges of extortion and corruption in Maharashtra, has been missing since May 4, and has failed to appear before a judicial commission looking into his allegations of graft against former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh.“Singh is in Chandigarh and will join the probe at a suitable time,” said the person cited above, requesting anonymity.Some news channels reported that Singh, 56, is likely to travel to Mumbai but added that he hadn’t decided on the next course of action.Singh also briefly appeared on Telegram on Wednesday but later deleted his account from the social messaging app. He, however, appeared to have switched his phone on after about six months.Singh has not reported to work since May 4, after his transfer from the post of Mumbai Police commissioner and his subsequent allegations of corruption against Deshmukh.The development came two days after the Supreme Court protected Singh from arrest in alleged extortion cases after the IPS officer said he was “very much in the country” and willing to submit to a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) or any agency other than Maharashtra police.A bench headed by justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul sought responses from CBI and the Maharashtra government on Singh’s plea to transfer investigation of six first information reports (FIRs) from Mumbai Police to the CBI, and fixed the matter for hearing next on December 6.The bench, which also comprised justice MM Sundresh, asked Singh to join the investigation by Mumbai Police in the meantime, but made it clear that he would not be arrested.Last week, the top court directed Singh to disclose his whereabouts while making it clear that it would not entertain his petition for protection against arrest until his location was known. “Where are you? Are you in the country or outside the country?” the apex court had asked.Singh, the second most senior Indian Police Service (IPS) serving officer in Maharashtra, was declared a proclaimed offender by a Mumbai court last week after he remained elusive since March and did not show up before the trial court despite several notices and warrants issued against him.Singh was transferred on March 17 after Mumbai Police officer Sachin Vaze was arrested in the case of an SUV with explosives found near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house, ‘Antilia’ and the subsequent suspicious death of businessman Mansukh Hiran.The saga began with the Antilla bomb scare case, where a SUV with some gelatin sticks was found near the residence of billionaire businessman Ambani. Singh was transferred for his mishandling of the case, and soon after wrote a letter to the chief minister alleging that Vaze, the policeman who is the main accused in the Antilla case, was asked to raise ₹100 crore a month by extortion by Deshmukh. The investigation against Deshmukh was sparked by his claims and petitions based on them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-mumbai-police-commissioner-param-bir-singh-in-chandigarh-may-join-probe-101637780305632.html
25-11-2021||India||Kerala adds 1,500 backlog Covid-19 deaths in November||Kerala, which has touted its low Covid-19 death rate as a measure of the quality of its health system and its ability to manage the pandemic, has added at least 1,500 backlog deaths thus far in November, almost 4% of the total of 38,353 deaths the state has seen thus far.Even with the additions, the state’s case fatality rate of 0.82% trails the national rate of 1.4% – but the 0.82% marks an almost doubling of the case fatality rate over the past six months. In October, 70% of the deaths recorded in the state were backlog deaths.The addition of the backlog has now taken the overall Covid-19 death toll in Kerala to 38,353. This pushes the state to second in terms of overall death numbers, edging out Karnataka, which has seen 38,185 deaths.On Wednesday, the country reported 397 fatalities (according to HT’s dashboard) of which Kerala’s share was 308 – 35 daily deaths and 273 that were designated as “virus-induced deaths” as per the new guidelines of the Union health ministry. It also reported 4,280 fresh cases and currently has an active case load of 51,302; India reported 9,072 cases and an active load of 117.488 cases.The state blames poor documentation and fresh Covid-19 death guidelines for the mounting numbers. The number is likely to go up further as 17,000 appeals for considering deaths as those caused by Covid-19 are pending with a committee that is overseeing norms for distributing compensation.Strangely, even a month after state health minister Veena George admitted in the assembly that around 7,000 deaths had failed to find mention in the Covid-19 death list only half have been added. Some of the backlog deaths being added date back to the first half of 2020.“From day one we have been following guidelines of Indian Council of Medical Research and there is no deliberate attempt to lessen numbers. Due to some technical glitches and other reasons some deaths failed to find in the list. We have already revised the list,” said Veena George.Health secretary Rajan Khobragade also said that since the Centre amended its rules for declaring deaths the state has also reviewed its list.Several other regions such as Maharashtra, Bihar, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, have all issued such statistical corrections over the past few months to incorporate previously uncounted fatalities in their Covid-19 death tolls, particularly those that occurred during the country’s brutal second wave.Public health experts and opposition parties have been alleging that the Kerala government has not been transparent with its data. “We are happy now the government conceded its mistakes. When we pointed out glares and lapses we were branded by the government. In initial days, the government was on an overdrive to show low deaths and laud its robust health system,” said health expert Dr SS Lal, who had a stint with the World Health Organisation. “The state was forced to correct its data once compensation was announced. The government should give real time data and share it with experts also,” said another public health expert Dr NM Arun.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-adds-1-500-backlog-covid-19-deaths-in-november-101637780244961.html
25-11-2021||India||Bengal CM Mamata calls on PM, flags BSF jurisdiction row and Tripura violence||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee flagged the enhanced jurisdiction of the Border Security Force (BSF) as a disturbance to the country’s federal structure and invited Prime Minister Narendra Modi to inaugurate a business summit in Kolkata in her meeting with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader on Wednesday.Banerjee also announced that she will go to Mumbai to meet Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar, and admitted that she didn’t seek time to meet Congress chief Sonia Gandhi.Hours after her meeting with the PM, TMC delivered its biggest jolt yet to the Congress by poaching 12 of the latter's 18 legislators in Meghalaya.The visit marked a growing distance between the Congress and the TMC, two parties otherwise interested in a broader Opposition pact against the BJP in 2024.Banerjee admitted that she didn’t seek time to meet Gandhi -- as first reported by HT -- and quipped, “They must be busy in Punjab election” before her sharp comment that it was not mandated in the Constitution that she must meet Gandhi.“Giving more powers to the BSF leads to confrontation in law and order with the state police. We are not against the BSF. It is not right to disturb the federal structure without any reason,” she said, referring to the Centre’s decision last month to increase the jurisdiction of the BSF from 15km to 50km from the border.The contentious amendment that will need Parliament’s approval puts roughly a third of the border state under the federal force.She raised the issue of the recent clashes in Tripura with the PM. “A popular artist like Sayoni Ghosh (TMC’s youth wing leader) was arrested. I have raised the matter with the PM,” she said.Though the BJP remains her biggest challenge in Bengal, she invited the PM for the first time for Bengal’s global business summit to be held next April. “He has accepted my invitation,” Banerjee said, “There are differences between political equations and the Centre-state relationship for development. The Centre will prosper only if the states prosper.”This was Banerjee’s second meeting with PM Modi after trouncing the BJP in a high-octane assembly election in May.She also defended her party’s Goa poll venture and said “every party has democratic right to contest” and made it clear that in the upcoming Uttar Pradesh polls, she is open to supporting Akhilesh Yadav’s Samajwadi Party. Banerjee also met BJP’s Subramanian Swamy on Wednesday.She also explained her party’s expansion plan and said, “We have started working in Goa and Haryana. But I think some places, the regional parties (like SP) should fight.

25-11-2021||India||Andhra passes bill prohibiting sale of movie tickets at cinema halls||The Andhra Pradesh assembly on Wednesday passed a bill prohibiting the sale of movie tickets at counters, making it mandatory for cinema halls to sell their tickets through a government-run online platform -- the first state in the country to take over sale of movie tickets to minimise tax evasion.The government has decided to introduce a seamless online movie booking system, on the lines of Indian Railways online ticketing system, minister for information and public relations Perni Venkatramaiah alias Nani told the assembly as he introduced the legislation on behalf of chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy. The assembly later unanimously passed the Andhra Pradesh Cinemas (Regulation) (Amendment) Act, 2021 by a voice vote. It will be introduced on Thursday in the state’s legislative council for passage before seeking the governor’s assent.The online booking system will be run by Andhra’s state film and theatre development corporation.Perni Venkatramaiah said the government will not allow theatres to screen more than four shows a day for any film. “All these days, the exhibitors have been screening the films for six or even seven shows a day to make big money. Besides, they are collecting ₹500 to ₹1,000 on each ticket in the name of benefit shows, ignoring rules and regulations,” he said.The online ticketing system run by the government will end all such activities, the minister said. The exhibitors will only screen films on prescribed timings and ticket prices will be completely under government control.He added that there were instances where there was no connection between a theatre’s collections and the Goods and Services Tax accruing to the state government from a particular film.“Now, producers and distributors cannot avoid payment of taxes to the government. Since the portal is managed by the state-run corporation, payment would be made to the theatres through Reserve Bank of India gateway on a day-to-day basis,” the minister added.Perni Venkatramaiah also underlined that the government-controlled ticketing system will benefit moviegoers as well. People will be able to book tickets of for their choice at any theatre by making a phone call, surfing the Internet, by sending SMS etc.The minister said it will help people get tickets without standing in long queues. “The proposed online movie booking system reduces traffic problems and pollution and helps in checking black-marketing,” the minister said.Popular Telugu film producer DVV Danaiah, whose multi-crore budget film “RRR” directed by SS Rajamouli of “Bahubali” fame, is up for release shortly, said the film industry doesn’t have any objections on the Andhra Pradesh government’s decision to take over online cinema ticketing system.“In fact, we welcome it, as it will lead to transparency in ticket sales. It will benefit both the industry as well as the government,” he said.Danayya, however, refused to comment on the government’s decision to control the number of shows to be screened in the theatres and restricting the number of the benefit shows.“We have to wait and see how the government will do that,” he said.Noted Telugu film critic Venkat Arikatla said the online ticketing system was going to be a complicated affair.“No doubt, it will definitely result in a transparency in the system and plug the holes in the revenue generation from films, but it is not so easy to operate the system,” he said.“The government says the portal will be operated and maintained by the AP Film and Theatre Development Corporation, but it requires huge investment, apart from technical manpower to run it. Instead, the government could have entered into a tie-up with already existing online cinema ticketing platforms like Bookmyshow.com by paying them certain fee,” Arikatla said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-passes-bill-prohibiting-sale-of-movie-tickets-at-cinema-halls-101637779884981.html
25-11-2021||India||Supreme Court asks govt view on ban on convicted lawmakers||The Supreme Court on Wednesday asked for the Centre’s view on imposing life bans from contesting elections on convicted lawmakers, noting that the issue was hanging fire for the last five years.Dealing with a 2016 petition filed by lawyer and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay, a three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana asked the Centre to make clear its stand on the issue. “Is the government prepared to have life ban on contesting elections for convicted politicians? You have to take a view. Unless you take some view, we cannot ask the Election Commission to ban such people from contesting elections.”Additional solicitor general (ASG) SV Raju, appearing for the Centre, replied that he would require to take instructions in this regard.The court also dealt with a petition filed by Samajwadi Party (SP) leader and MLA Mohammad Azam Khan, who complained that due to court’s orders in these proceedings, cases to be tried by a magistrate were shifted to a sessions court designated as a special court to try cases against MPs and MLAs, thus depriving him of an essential layer of appeal.The bench, also comprising justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and Surya Kant, noted that the Allahabad high court “misconstrued” its past orders requiring special courts for MPs and MLAs to be designated at both the magisterial and sessions court levels. “Our directions do not mandate the high courts to transfer cases which are triable by magistrates to sessions courts,” the bench said.Accordingly, the Court directed the Allahabad high court to issue a fresh notification replacing its earlier order of August 2019 designating 62 Sessions courts as special courts to try MP/MLA cases and provide for such courts at magistrate level. For cases already pending trial before sessions court, the bench directed the entire case records to be transferred to the special court at magistrate level while clarifying that “proceedings shall commence from the stage which has been reached prior to the transfer of the proceedings, as a consequence of which the trial shall not have to commence afresh.”When the discussion on this matter was concluded, the pending issue of life ban on convicted politicians was brought up by Upadhyay. He told the court that his petition, filed five years ago, raised the issue of criminalisation of politics, demanding fast-tracking criminal trials against sitting and former members of Parliament and legislative assemblies. Though this was sufficiently addressed through various orders passed by the court directing high courts to set up special courts for speedy trials, the petition also sought a life ban from contesting polls on convicted lawmakers.Upadhyay’s application challenged the validity of Sections 8(1), 8(2), 8(3) and 9(1) of the Representation of Peoples (RP) Act, 1951, in which a six-year disqualification from contesting polls is prescribed on a legislator being convicted for an offence which carries a sentence of two years and above.In December 2020, the ministry of law and justice responded on the issue by filing an affidavit opposing the life ban. Although the matter has since been heard on many occasions, the aspect of life ban and the affidavit in question has not been taken up by the Court. The Court has not indicated when the matter will be taken up next.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-asks-govt-view-on-ban-on-convicted-lawmakers-101637779824981.html
25-11-2021||India||Taliban look to ‘balance’ ties with India, Pakistan||Days before the Taliban’s acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi embarked on a visit to Pakistan on November 10, one of his aides reached out to an intermediary to ascertain whether there were any India-related issues that should be raised in Islamabad.The aide from Muttaqi’s office also wanted to ascertain from the intermediary whether there were any sensitivities that should be kept in mind in the Taliban foreign policy chief’s maiden engagement with the Pakistani leadership, people familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity.Muttaqi’s aide was informed about the need to take up with the Pakistani leadership the offer made by India several weeks ago to supply 50,000 tonnes of wheat to Afghanistan, and the pressing need to make travel arrangements for hundreds of Afghan citizens stranded across India since the fall of the Ashraf Ghani government in August, the people said.Pakistan had not responded to India’s proposal to ship the wheat to Afghanistan via the Wagah land border crossing in the absence of direct flights.The Taliban delegation led by Muttaqi, which was in Pakistan for three days, raised both issues with top leaders such as foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi and Prime Minister Imran Khan. As a result, Khan announced on November 22 that his government would allow the shipment of the Indian wheat as soon as modalities were worked out by Islamabad and New Delhi.Khan said Pakistan would also facilitate the return of Afghans who had gone to India for medical treatment and were stuck there.This outreach by Muttaqi’s camp and the Taliban’s balanced response to the November 10 meeting of senior security officials of seven countries, including Iran and Russia, that was convened by India are being seen in some quarters as an attempt by the Taliban to strike a balance in their attempts to forge relations with Pakistan and India.Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid had said the first regional meeting on Afghanistan convened by India was in the “better interest of Afghanistan” and reiterated the group’s policy on not allowing Afghan soil to be “used against any country”. The Taliban, he added, had no “objection or anxiety” about the meeting.“Though we are not present in this conference, we firmly believe this conference is in the better interest of Afghanistan...and the participating countries also must be thoughtful of improving and safeguarding the security situation in Afghanistan and helping the current government to ensure security in the country on its own,” Mujahid said.One of the people cited above said: “It is difficult to gauge their sincerity but they do seem to be going through the motions to create an impression that they want a balance between Pakistan and India. It also suits the Taliban to be seen as not completely reliant on Pakistan.”The Indian side, which had opened channels of communication with sections of the Taliban leadership last year, has made it clear it is in no rush to give legitimacy or recognition to the Taliban setup. New Delhi has insisted that Afghanistan must not be used for planning or executing terror attacks on other countries and an inclusive government must be formed in Kabul.Participating in an online event organised on Wednesday by the Indian Chamber of Commerce, foreign secretary Harsh Shringla described the Indian side’s conversations so far with the Taliban as “very reassuring” but also listed the world community’s continuing concerns on Afghanistan.Though the rapid developments in Afghanistan amounted to a setback, he said: “We have also established some contact with the Taliban both in Doha as well as in Moscow in the talks, and I think the Taliban in our conversation with them have been very reassuring. They have recognised that India has contributed greatly to the people of Afghanistan, that our developmental projects over the last 20 years have greatly contributed to Afghanistan’s development.”He added the Taliban “want us to provide humanitarian assistance, they want us to re-establish our embassy there. So they have said good things, which is a good start.”India, Shringla said, will now “have to see how best to protect our interests, make the best of a difficult situation”, and also make sure the country is “not in any way vulnerable to the new strategic realities” of the region. He referred to the UN Security Council resolution 2593 on Afghanistan and said it lays down the international community’s expectations of the Taliban.“One is an inclusive negotiated political settlement, the second is that its territory should not be used against the detriment of any others, the third is that they should provide humanitarian access, the fourth is that there should be no human rights abuses on women, children and minorities,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/taliban-look-to-balance-ties-with-india-pakistan-101637779766204.html
25-11-2021||India||Congress leaders’ discussion on Patel triggers row in Karnataka||A month-old purported video of a conversation between Karnataka former chief minister Siddaramaiah and state Congress chief DK Shivakumar sparked a political slugfest as Siddramaiah seems to persuade Shivakumar to get a portrait of Sardar Vallabhai Patel on his birth anniversary, which was on October 31.The incident took place during an event organised at the Bengaluru party office to mark the death anniversary of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on October 31, also the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel. In a conversation caught on camera, senior leader Siddaramaiah is heard informing Shivakumar about Patel’s birth anniversary and suggesting a photo be placed next to Gandhi. Shivakumar is heard saying “we never do this”, to which, Siddaramaiah replied: “BJP will take advantage of this.” Little later, a portrait of Patel is placed alongside that of Indira Gandhi. Soon after the alleged video went viral on social media, BJP leaders took to Twitter to accuse the Congress party of insulting Patel. “If anyone had a doubt how much the Nehru Dynasty hated Sardar Patel, this video clears it. CONgress leaders @siddaramaiah & @DKShivakumar agree to place a photo of Sardar Patel along with that of Indira Gandhi fearing BJP. It is a shame that Slaves are so much scared of an Italian,” CT Ravi, the national general secretary of the BJP, said in a post on Twitter. “Leaked voices of top Karnataka Congress leaders during a Press briefing exposes the typical “Dynastic” mindset of the party where tall leaders like Sardar Patel are pulled out of “Store Rooms” lest the BJP doesn’t take political benefit out of the situation,” Sambit Patra, the BJP national spokesperson also posted, with the hashtag #CongressInsultsPatel. He added that the Congress party never think beyond the ‘Gandhis’. “The Congress can never think beyond the “Gandhis” ..for them, it’s the Family over Subash Bose, Sardar Patel & Baba Saheb Ambedkar. BJP never appropriated Sardar Patel...Since the Congress rejected the Sardar, we gave due place to the “Iron Man” of India,” Patra said in his two-part tweet. Later in the day, Shivakumar hit back at the BJP’s criticism, saying, “Let them (BJP) show whether they have celebrated Vallabhai Patel’s birthday in Karnataka. Since he was a Congress president and banned the RSS, they (BJP) never do it. We, Congressmen, have a lot of respect for him, and we do it every year. We wanted to do a separate programme.” “In no offices do they celebrate Vallabhai Patel’s birth anniversary? It is only Congress which does. Indira Gandhi is separate from the Congress party. Her contribution, sacrifice for the nation, and integrity of this country is different compared to Vallabhai Patel. But still, he is our leader, our president, he is the Iron Man, and we spoke and decided let us have a separate programme for him,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-leaders-discussion-on-patel-triggers-row-in-karnataka-101637779705995.html
25-11-2021||India||India weighs options on Chinese trade ties||The government is carefully assessing all options to ensure that India’s trade and investment ties with China do not leave the country vulnerable in any way, foreign secretary Harsh Shringla said on Wednesday against the backdrop of the standoff on the Line of Actual Control (LAC). Normal ties in areas such as trade and technology are based on peace and tranquillity being maintained in the border areas, but the two sides have been unable to “conduct normal relations” since China adopted an “aggressive posture and attempted multiple transgressions” along the border in eastern Ladakh, Shringla said. “Trade continues, there are investment ties that continue but all of this has to be examined very carefully and the government is examining all these options very, very carefully to ensure that our integrity and security remain intact,” he said at an online interaction on the theme “Bharat@75: Empowering India” organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce. Shringla was responding to a question from the moderator for the event, who described China as India’s biggest foreign policy challenge and asked what could be done to address the issue. The foreign secretary said India will have to ensure it is not vulnerable in any way because of its economic and trade ties with China. “Last year...we saw that China maintained an aggressive posture and attempted multiple transgressions along our border in eastern Ladakh. That obviously was not conducive to peace and security, and as a result, we are not able to conduct normal relations,” he said. “Having said that, of course trade continues, import and export continues, China continues to be an economic partner. But obviously we need to today evaluate whether we are over-extended in terms of our supply chains, in terms of our investment tie-ups, in terms of the technology that we get,” he added. All these issues need to be carefully examined to see “that it is in keeping with our larger strategic and security interests and that obviously, as we move forward, our own economy grows, our own interactions grow”, he said. “We need to ensure that we are not vulnerable in any way. On the contrary, our growth and development can be faster and better ensured,” Shringla said. India and China have been locked in a standoff in the Ladakh sector since May last year and a brutal clash at Galwan Valley in June 2020, that killed 20 Indian soldiers and at least four Chinese troops, has taken relations to an all-time low. External affairs minister S Jaishankar said last week ties are passing through a “particularly bad patch” and China still hasn’t given a credible explanation for massing tens of thousands of troops on the LAC. The two sides pulled back frontline troops at Pangong Lake and Gogra after several rounds of talks, but there has been no headway in disengagement at other friction points since August. India has linked the normalisation of overall ties with China to the resolution of the standoff. Soon after the standoff began, India imposed a ban on more than 200 apps owned by some of the biggest Chinese internet firms and restricted foreign direct investment from China, especially in critical sectors such as telecommunications. Shringla pointed out that India had restarted ties with China in 1988 with the objective of allowing “normal business to be conducted without the border issue coming in the way of that relationship”. “In other words, we would have trade, commercial ties, scientific and technological ties, people-to-people contacts but we would isolate the border issues that would be discussed separately through the special representatives of both countries. But of course, that was predicated on peace and tranquillity being maintained in the border areas,” he said. The rapid rise of China, both as a military and an economic power, is an issue the world is grappling with, and India is in the process of protecting its own strategic and security interests, Shringla said. “We have had several rounds of talks with China. We have resolved some of the issues but there are still some outstanding issues and until we can resolve those issues, obviously we will not be in a normal relationship mode,” he added. At their latest round of diplomatic talks on the standoff on November 18, India and China agreed to hold the next discussions between senior military commanders at an early date but were unable to make headway on the bigger issues. The meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs was held against the backdrop of growing evidence of China building infrastructure and villages in disputed sections of the border with both India and Bhutan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/taliban-look-to-balance-ties-with-india-pakistan-101637779644930.html
25-11-2021||India||How to solve the crypto conundrum?||Web3, the buzzword of the year, is, as some experts have described it, all about the decentralisation of the Internet. The current iteration of the Internet is dominated by gigantic technology firms, many with as much power as large countries. Some of these companies have their own Web3 plans. Yet, the next generation of the Internet is actually about a future where these companies are no longer the main gatekeepers and custodians of data. Instead, proponents of Web3 claim that thanks to the use of Blockchain technology, a collective of users will perform the twin roles — of gatekeeping and custodianship. Blockchain, the emerging vision for Web3 claims, will help build apps that bypass the current gatekeepers almost entirely. This is the disintermediation of companies that made disintermediation their business.It’s all deliciously vague, like technology at the bleeding edge usually is — but so far, so good. And, in many ways, the promise of decentralisation that is at the core of Web3 (one analyst described it as a personal patch of the Internet) harks back to the near Utopian concept of an open Internet and one, more importantly, controlled by users, not large firms that do not always have the best interests of users in mind.A quick diversion may be required here: AI (artificial intelligence) isn’t Web3, although some people see it as a layer on top of Web3 technologies that helps people interact better with other people, and with machines.But to return to Web3, thus far our experience with this new phase of the Internet (the third, as the name suggests) has been shaped by cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens or NFTs, digital autonomous organisations or DAOs, and DeFi or decentralised finance. Those are a lot of fuzzy buzzwords, so some definitions first.NFTs are unique pieces of data stored on a distributed digital ledger (Blockchain is nothing but a kind of digital, distributed, decentralised ledger, 3Ds and an L), so it is easy to see how a piece of digital art can be NFT-ised. DAOs are, again, decentralised organisations with no clear leader, usually set up for a specific purpose, with established rules, and funded either by NFTs or crypto; and DeFis are entities that use Blockchain contracts to offer traditional financial instruments (thereby completely disintermediating traditional financial entities including banks and brokerages).It’s all very breathless and exciting. And, given the rush of venture capital to Blockchain companies across crypto, payments, mining, finance, and exchanges, flush with funds.The most problematic of these (and also in the news thanks to the law that the Indian government hopes to introduce in Parliament this session, clamping down on private cryptocurrencies) is crypto.It is problematic at three levels.The first, at the sovereign one. Issuing currency is a sovereign right. Having non-central bank or monetary authority issued currency sloshing around the system has significant economic implications — few of them salutary.The second is at the financial level. Just what is the asset underlying the currency. What is its intrinsic value? Central bank issued currencies are guaranteed by the sovereign. But what about crypto?The third is at the operational level. Isn’t this a classic instance of the medium becoming the message? A case where code that seeks to make transactions and contracts secure (and distributed) and easy across borders, takes on value of the currency involved in the underlying contract or transaction?And in India, there is a fourth-level problem as well. Replete with venture capital, a clutch of crypto start-ups have indulged in high-decibel, and often irresponsible advertising, passing off crypto as yet another get-rich-quick scheme. The numbers being thrown around — 15 million investors; $10 billion in investments; investments in Tier-2 and Tier-3 towns — have only served to create the impression of a bubble. Which isn’t surprising — because, at one level, it is.The exact contours of the law that India will introduce isn’t clear. It could completely ban private cryptocurrencies and trading in them; or it could just ban their use as a currency and allow their trade as an asset class (although that begs the question on the value of the underlying asset). India’s long experience with companies that ran get-rich-quick schemes speaks of the relative unsophistication of small investors who burn their hands on these — which may mean a complete ban may not be out of place.But there’s more to Web3 than crypto (although there’s an unkind school of thought that Web3 is an invention of crypto entrepreneurs to make their business seem above board; if so, India’s crypto start-ups did a pretty shoddy job of this). India would do well to tap other benefits of Web3. This could deepen financial inclusion, reduce the cost and increase the ease of investment in various financial instruments, make transactions safer and more private, facilitate smooth cross-border transactions, and help data localisation. It could even universalise land titling (in a country where most people do not actually have titles to the land or property in their possession).Some of these objectives can be met by having a central bank issued digital currency. Years ago, in an editorial in Mint, my former colleague Niranjan Rajadhyaksha even suggested a name for this — Bharatcoin. And the others can be met by creating a national Blockchain or Web3 mission that figures out how to use these emerging technologies. There will be a significant role for Web3 start-ups to play in this, and new, and profitable business models. But however clever it may sound — the reinvention of currency isn’t a great business model. Or is it?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-to-solve-the-crypto-conundrum-101637779526577.html
25-11-2021||India||National Family and Health Survey: More women than men in India for the 1st time||India now has 1,020 women for every 1000 men, is not getting any younger, and no longer faces the threat of a population explosion.All three radical findings are part of the summary findings of the fifth round of the National Family and Health Survey (NFHS), which were released by the Union health ministry on November 24. To be sure, NFHS is a sample survey, and whether these numbers apply to the larger population can only be said with certainty when the next national census is conducted, although it is very likely that they will in the case of many states and Union territories.The numbers indicate that India can no longer be called a country of “missing women”, a phrase first used by Nobel Prize winning economist Amartya Sen in a 1990 essay in the New York Review of Books. Back then, there were 927 women per 1,000 men in India. According to NFHS-3, conducted in 2005-06, the ratio was equal, 1000: 1000; it went down to 991:1000 in 2015-16 in NFHS-4. This is the first time, in any NFHS or Census, that the sex ratio is skewed in favour of women.“The improved sex ratio and sex ratio at birth is also a significant achievement; even though the real picture will emerge from the census, we can say for now looking at the results that our measures for women empowerment have steered us in the right direction ,” said Vikas Sheel, additional secretary, Union ministry of health and family welfare and mission director, National Health Mission.To be sure, the gender ratio at birth for children born in the last five years is still 929, which suggests that son-preference, in its various macabre forms, still persists, but the sex ratio is a significant milestone achieved on the back of policies aimed to curb sex selection practices that were once rampant and female infanticide, and on the fact that women in India tend to live longer than men.The average life expectancy at birth for men and women was 66.4 years and 69.6 years respectively in 2010-14, according to data from the Census of India website.There are other interesting read outs from the survey.The share of population under the age of 15 years, which was 34.9% in 2005-06, has come down to 26.5% in 2019-21. India is still a young country -- a median age of 24 years in 2011 according to the Census figures -- but it is ageing, and that comes with the associated policy challenges.“The fact that we are now an aging population suggests that our approach to women’s health needs a more holistic life cycle view rather than one that prioritises reproductive health only,” Yamini Aiyar, president of the Centre for Policy Research, said. “The fact that more women have completed ten years of schooling in 2019-20 than previously coincides with a drop in female labour force participation points to significant structural challenges in India’s labour market. These need to be urgently addressed if India is to make progress,” Aiyar added.Finally, the total fertility rate (TFR), or the average number of children per women in India, is now just 2, which is below the internationally accepted replacement level fertility rate – the point at which a population exactly replaces itself from one generation to the next -- of 2.1. This means, India’s population may have peaked -- another data-point that can only be established by the Census, but which is almost certainly for at least the southern states, as well some of the richer ones.“There is usually a gap of 30-40 years between total fertility rate falling below replacement levels and a decline in overall population, because the population which will give birth in the next 10-15 years has already been born in the past when fertility levels were higher,” said Dr KS James, director and senior professor at the International Institute for Population Sciences. “Of course, the population growth in southern states is going to fall at a faster rate than the rest of the country,” he added.NFHS-5 was conducted in two phases between 2019 and 2021, and covered 650,000 households from 707 districts of the country. The States and UTs that were surveyed in Phase-II are Arunachal Pradesh, Chandigarh, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, NCT of Delhi, Odisha, Puducherry, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand.The findings of NFHS-5 in respect of 22 States & UTs covered in Phase-I were released in December 2020.NFHS is the most comprehensive database on a host of socioeconomic and health indicators with a focus on women – NFHS-5 covered 720,000 women and just above 100,000 men – and its basic results can be compared to the previous four rounds which were conducted in 1992-93, 1998-99, 2005-06 and 2015-16.To be sure, successive NFHS rounds have expanded their coverage both in terms of their sample size as well as number of indicators on which information is collected.While the statistics quoted above are a watershed moment in India’s socio-economic and demographic transformation story, other findings of NFHS also convey a similar message. Socio-economic challenges facing India, going forward, will need to be dealt with more nuance and some of the stereotypes and political beliefs (such as the political obsession with population control laws) which dominate the public discourse will need to be shelved.For example, balanced diets need as much attention as adequate diets as obesity and anaemia (more than half of women and children suffer from it) are on the rise, even as undernourishment continues to decline at the national level. To be sure, there is some evidence to suggest that the fight against undernutrition has lost momentum.“Overall, the NFHS-5 shows a reduction in stunting, which is an indicator of chronic undernutrition, from 38.4% to 35.5%, which is only about 3 percentage points in five years, about 0.6 percentage point a year. Between NFHS-3 and NFHS-4 we saw a improvement from 48% to 38.4%, roughly 1 percentage point a year. So there is definitely a slowdown in improvement and this is much below the goals set under Poshan Abhiyaan,” Dipa Sinha, an assistant professor of economics at Ambedkar University who is also associated with the Right to Food campaign, said. “We also know that in some states stunting has actually shown a reversal, so a more detailed analysis will be required. The other concerning findings in NFHS-5 related to nutrition are the increase in anaemia as well as the increase in overweight/obesity,” Sinha added.“The findings on fertility decline are good news for maternal and child health and nutrition outcomes. However, the high fertility-high undernutrition states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Jharkhand still need to see more progress on fertility reductions – improvements in those high burden states are essential to move the all-India average for all outcomes,” said Purnima Menon, senior research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute. “The undernutrition improvements in UP and Bihar that are signalled in the NFHS-5 are also really promising and need deeper analyses to understand further,” Menon added.Despite the government’s claims of at least two of its policy-level programmes achieving the targets of eradicating open defecation and ensuring a switch to clean fuel, gaps remain on both these fronts: 70.2% and 58.6% of households use an improved sanitation facility and clean fuel for cooking, respectively. These numbers still mark a huge improvement over data from the previous round of the survey -- 48.5% and 43.8%, respectively.Other schemes such as promotion of financial inclusion and health insurance coverage seem to have worked well. The share of women who had a bank account they themselves use went up from 53% in NFHS-4 to 78.6% in NFHS-5. Similarly, health insurance coverage has increased from 28.7% to 41% (the NFHS-5 might not have covered the full gains of the central government’s health insurance programme, the ministry said) between NFHS-4 and NFHS-5.The government is yet to release the full database of NFHS-5. Detailed all-India report and reports for the states and Union territories which were canvassed in the second round and the unit level data had not been released at the time of writing this story. This means that a disaggregated analysis by caste, wealth levels and religion, etc, is not possible at the moment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/national-family-and-health-survey-more-women-than-men-in-india-for-the-first-time-101637779104256.html

We have decided to ease the restrictions, but a strict watch will be kept on the sources [of pollution],” Rai told reporters following the meeting, where it was also decided to allow government offices to call employees on-site.

They team up with Mamata’s TMC||The Congress party in Meghalaya suffered a jolt on Wednesday night with 12 of its 17 MLAs in the state, including former chief minister Mukul Sangma, switching sides and joining the Trinamool Congress (TMC). With the sudden move, TMC which had practically no presence in the north-eastern state becomes the largest opposition party in the 60-member house. The state is ruled by the Meghalaya Democratic Alliance, which is led by the National People’s Party and has BJP as a minor partner. Senior Congress leaders in Meghalaya including Sangma and state unit chief Vincent H Pala didn’t take calls, while people familiar with the development informed that the Congress MLAs led by the former chief minister have already submitted their resignations to Speaker Metbah Lyngdoh. Wednesday’s development comes two months after speculations surfaced that Sangma was upset with the Congress leadership and was planning to quit the party and join TMC. At that time the former CM had rubbished the reports and said they were mere speculation. Sangma was unhappy at being sidelined during appointment of Pala to a party post in August and had started skipping Congress events in Meghalaya. There were also rumours that he was looking at joining other parties including the BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/12-meghalaya-cong-mlas-join-tmc-making-it-largest-opposition-party-in-60-member-house-101637778924779.html
25-11-2021||India||The key demographic transitions captured by the 5th round of NFHS||The Union health ministry released the summary findings of the fifth round of the National Family and Health Survey (NFHS-5), conducted in two phases between 2019 and 2021, on November 24. NFHS is the most comprehensive survey on socio-economic and health indicators in the country. While the results of the first phase were released in December last year, country-level statistics were released only on Wednesday. The previous four rounds of the NFHS were conducted in 1992-93, 1998-99, 2005-06 and 2015-16.The results of the survey show some surprising demographic transitions, such as women outnumbering men, and some expected ones, such as fertility rates declining. They also highlight the health challenges that remain, such as moving towards addressing nutrition deficiency apart from just food adequacy. And they offer a more sobering picture of the impact of government’s schemes on access to basic amenities such as clean cooking fuel and improved sanitation. Here are four charts that show this.Women outnumber men, fertility has decreased, and India is getting olderNFHS-5 data shows that there were 1,020 women for 1000 men in the country in 2019-2021. This is the highest sex ratio for any NFHS survey as well as since the first modern synchronous census conducted in 1881. To be sure, in the 2005-06 NFHS, the sex ratio was 1,000 or women and men were equal in number.The improved sex ratio is not the only big demographic transition that the latest round of NFHS has revealed. The Total Fertility Rate (TFR) has also come down below the threshold at which the population is expected to replace itself from one generation to next. TFR was 2 in 2019-2021, just below the replacement fertility rate of 2.1. To be sure, in rural areas, the TFR is still 2.1. In urban areas, TFR had gone below the replacement fertility rate in the 2015-16 NFHS itself.A decline in TFR, which implies that lower number of children are being born, also entails that India’s population would become older. Sure enough, the survey shows that the share of under-15 population in the country has therefore further declined from 28.6% in 2015-16 to 26.5% in 2019-21.Children’s nutrition improved but at a slower paceThe share of stunted (low height for age), wasted (low weight for height), and underweight (low weight for age) children have all come down since the last NFHS conducted in 2015-16. However, the share of severely wasted children has not, nor has the share of overweight (high weight for height) or anaemic children. The share of overweight children has increased from 2.1% to 3.4%. The share of anaemic children has increased from 58.6% to 67.1%. Another cause of worry for children’s nutrition is that the pace at which the share of stunted and underweight children decreased in the latest NFHS was less than the pace at which it did between the 2005-06 and 2015-16 surveys. The share of stunted children decreased by 20% between NFHS-3 and NFHS-4, but only by 7.6% between NFHS-4 and NFHS-5. The corresponding numbers for underweight children are 15.8% decline between NFHS-3 and NFHS-4 and 10.3% decline in the latest round. A similar challenge remains in reducing mortality rates of children. All such indicators suggest a declining rate of mortality, but the pace at which it declined in the last round has come down.India might be food secure, but nutrition is a problem for adults tooFor children and their mothers, there are at least government schemes such as Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) that seek to address the nutritional needs at the time of childbirth and infancy.However, there is a need to address the nutritional needs of adults too. In October 2020, a paper by Kalyani Raghunathan published in the Food Policy journal (and reported in this paper) showed that though India might have achieved food security, 60% of Indians cannot afford nutritious diets.This is reinforced by the results of the latest NFHS. While the share of women and men with below normal Body Mass Index (BMI) has decreased, the share of overweight and obese (those with above normal BMI) and the share of anaemic has increased between 2 and 4 percentage points. The problem of anaemia is more prevalent among women. In 2015-16, 53% women were anaemic compared to 23% men in the 15-49 age group. These numbers have now increased to 57% and 25% for women and men respectively.Challenges remain on open defecation and use of clean fuelAvailability of basic amenities such as improved sanitation facilities clean fuel for cooking, or menstrual hygiene products can improve health outcomes. There has been an improvement on indicators for all three since the last NFHS. However, the degree of improvement might be less than claimed by the government. For example, only 70% population had access to an improved sanitation facility.While not exactly an indicator of open defecation, it means that the remaining 30% of the population has a flush or pour flush toilet not connected to a sewer, septic tank or pit latrine, uses a public toilet or still practices open defecation. The share of households that use clean cooking fuel is also just 59%.The schemes of the NDA government under Narendra Modi for financial inclusion, however, seem to have worked better. The share of women having a bank account that they themselves use has increased from 53% to 79%. Households’ coverage by health insurance or financing scheme also has increased 1.4 times to 41%, a clear indication of the impact of the government’s health insurance scheme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-key-demographic-transitions-captured-by-the-5th-round-of-nfhs-101637777904158.html

The following is the text of the firman: “Whereas in the best interests of the State of Hyderabad, which is closely linked with the rest of India by a community of interest in the economic, political and other fields, it is desirable that a constitutional relationship should be established between this State and the contemplated Union of India; “And whereas, the Constitution of India, as drafted by the Constituent Assembly of India, provides a suitable basis for this State to enter into such a constitutional relationship with the Indian Union, as also for re-ordering the internal constitutional structure of the State. “I hereby declare and direct that the Constitution of India shortly to be adopted by the Constituent Assembly of India shall be the constitution for the State of Hyderabad as for the other parts of India, and shall be enforced as such by me, my heirs and successors in accordance with the tenor of its provisions and that the provisions of the said Constitution shall, as from the date of its commencement, supersede and abrogate all other constitutional provisions inconsistent therewith, which are at present in force in this State. “I further declare that the above decision which I have taken after mature consideration in order to ensure for the people of Hyderabad, the benefits of an honourable partnership in a united and democratic India, shall, in view of its far-reaching consequences, be subject to ratification by the people of this State, whose will as expressed through the Constituent Assembly of the State proposed to be constituted shortly must finally determine the nature of the relationship between this State and the Union of India, as also the Constitution of the State itself.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htthisday-november-24-1949-hyderabad-accedes-to-india-101637762724527.html
25-11-2021||India||Cabinet gives nod for repeal of farm laws||The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved a proposal to repeal three contentious laws that resulted in tens of thousands of farmers protesting for over a year but agitating unions indicated that the stir will continue until the government legislated crop price guarantees.Union minister for information and broadcasting Anurag Thakur said the Cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi cleared the formalities to roll back the laws, which were passed in September 2020. PM Modi announced in a televised address to the nation on November 19 that his government would revoke the legislation during the Winter Session of Parliament.The Cabinet’s nod will allow the government to table a “repeal bill” in Parliament to revoke three separate laws to liberalise trade in farm produce. A bulletin from the Lok Sabha on Tuesday listed the Farm Laws Repeal Bill, 2021, as one of the 26 pieces of legislation to be introduced during the session.Thakur said the process of repealing the laws would begin as soon as Parliament convenes.“In the upcoming session of Parliament, it will be our priority to take back these three laws,” he added.The Winter Session will begin on November 29 and conclude on December 23.The minister did not answer questions on whether the government will consider demands from protesting farmers for law guaranteeing minimum support prices.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha , a platform for farm unions, said the agitation will continue till the government acceded to all their “rightful demands”, including statutory provisions to ensure minimum support prices for farm produce.“This protest will not end yet. We have a meeting on November 27 after which we will take further decisions...Farmers’ victory will be ensured when they get the right price for their crops,” Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait tweeted in Hindi.Under Article 245 of the Indian Constitution, Parliament is vested with powers to both pass and annul laws. If Parliament is in recess, the government can repeal or enact laws by bringing an ordinance, which needs to be ratified by the House later. The legislative process of passing, amending or scrapping legislation is largely the same, experts said. A fresh repealing bill needs to be approved to junk an existing law.“A bill to repeal an existing law and its passage is all that is needed. It has to be passed by a majority like any other law,” said GC Malhotra, former secretary-general of the Lok Sabha.The laws were aimed to ease restrictions on trade in farm produce, allow food traders to stockpile large stocks of food for future sales and lay down a national framework for contract farming based on a written agreement.Farm unions say the legislation would have left them at the mercy of large corporations, leaving them with little bargaining power.The decision to scrap the laws came ahead of state elections in Uttar Pradesh, the country’s most populous bellwether state, and Punjab, where farmers are an influential voting bloc.Thakur said the Cabinet also approved the extension of the free food grain scheme Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) until March. The extension will cost ₹2.6 lakh crore. Under PMGKAY, the Centre provides 5kg of foodgrain per person, per month, to nearly 793.9 million beneficiaries. PMGKAY was meant to provide higher food quantities during the pandemic. It was launched in March 2020 for the April-June 2020 period but was extended until November 30.The Opposition said the decision to withdraw the farm laws was a defeat of the Centre.“I congratulate the farmers of the country who struggled for so long and died for the cause. Today they have won and the central government has lost. Arrogance has been crushed,” said Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Lalu Prasad.Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar alleged that the central government would not have taken the decision if there were no elections in Uttar Pradesh and other states.“There are elections in UP and other neighbouring states. As per our information, the people in power, when they visited the villages in some parts of these states, they got some different kind of reception from the locals. Considering this, they might have sensed what kind of treatment they will get when they go to seek votes. It seems that on that backdrop, this practical decision was taken,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cabinet-nod-for-repeal-of-farm-laws-extension-of-pmgkay-scheme-101637751863401.html
25-11-2021||India||India’s fertility rate drops below 2.1, contraceptive prevalence up: NFHS||India’s Total Fertility Rate (TFR), or the average number of children a woman gives birth to in her lifetime, has declined from 2.2 to 2 while the Contraceptive Prevalence Rate (CPR) has increased from 54% to 67%, according data from the National Family Health Survey-5. The union health ministry released data for Phase-2 of the survey on Wednesday; data from Phase-1 was released in December 2020.A TFR of 2.1 is termed the replacement rate, and means there will be neither an increase, nor a decrease in population.As per the fourth edition of the survey conducted between 2015 and 2016, the TFR was 2.2. The fifth survey was conducted between 2019 and 2021 in two phases and reflects gains made in population control.
25-11-2021||India||Train for Ayodhya pilgrimage to leave Delhi on December 3: Kejriwal||The first train to Ayodhya as part of the Delhi government’s free pilgrimage scheme for senior citizens will leave on December 3, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced on Wednesday. He also added the Velankanni church in Tamil Nadu to government’s list of free pilgrimage sites for Christian residents of the national capital.“Last month, I visited the Ram temple in Ayodhya. After returning, I got Ayodhya included in the Delhi government’s Mukhya Mantri Teerth Yatra Yojna. Today, I am happy to announce that the first train for Ayodhya with the city’s senior citizens will leave from Delhi on December 3. Every senior citizen can bring a young attendant to take care of them. The cost of both will be borne by the government,” Kejriwal said in a digital press briefing. The chief minister said that, on the demand of the city’s Christian community, the Delhi government will also include a free pilgrimage trip to Velankanni Church soon. “Many Christians wish to go to Velankanni Church. We are going to include Velankanni Church in the list of pilgrimage very soon and you will also be able to go on pilgrimage as per your wish. May everyone be blessed and be happy and healthy by the grace of God,” he said. The Ram Mandir is an emotive issue in Uttar Pradesh, where Kejriwal’s Aam Aadmi Party has decided to contest the assembly elections early next year. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh on Wednesday said that seat-sharing talks have begun with the Samajwadi Party to set up a common platform against the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the state.Under the Mukhya Mantri Teerth Yatra Yojna, Hindu pilgrims who are over 60 years of age can also visit Vaishno Devi, Shirdi, Rameswaram, Dwarka, Puri, Haridwar, Rishikesh, Mathura, Vrindavan, among others and Sikh residents have the option to do a Delhi-Amritsar-Wagha Border-Anandpur Sahib-Delhi tour for four days.Senior citizens availing of the free pilgrimage scheme are issued certificates by the MLAs of their respective areas, ministers of the Delhi government, or the chairman of the Tirth Yatra Vikas Samiti. The Delhi government bears all the expenses on the pilgrimage, including travel, food and accommodation. Facilities such as paramedical staff and attendants are also provided during the journeyThe scheme was approved by the Kejriwal government in 2018. So far, over 36,000 people have availed the scheme. The Delhi-Ayodhya-Delhi tour will be the 13th destination and the Delhi-Velankanni church-Delhi route will be the 14th once it is officially approved by the Cabinet.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “The BJP hopes these yatras will continue beyond ensuing municipal polls, unlike the past when the Arvind Kejriwal government launched Tirth Yatra Scheme in mid-2019 and stalled it after the assembly elections in January 2020. No one heard about the scheme from the Delhi government till October 2021,” said .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/train-for-ayodhya-pilgrimage-to-leave-delhi-on-december-3kejriwal-101637740582398.html
25-11-2021||India||Covaxin 50% effective against Delta variant: Real-world study||The findings are based on the study conducted between April 15 and May 15, at the height of India’s second wave of infections this year. Covaxin in clinical trials had an estimated efficacy of 65% when the more infectious Delta variant was taken into account.Covaxin in clinical trials had an estimated efficacy of 65% when the more infectious Delta variant was taken into account.All vaccines have shown to be less effective when infections have been caused by the more transmissible variant of the Sars-CoV-2, and the latest report underscores the higher odds of catching Covid-19 during an active wave and among healthcare workers.According to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, the efficacy of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine dropped from 93.7% to 88% and that of the AstraZeneca vaccine (as the Covishield shot is known in markets where the British pharma company makes) from 75% to 67% when protection against Alpha and Delta variants were compared. It is likely those numbers may have reduced further for high-risk groups such as hospital workers.“…The adjusted effectiveness of BBV152 against symptomatic Covid-19 after two doses administered at least 14 days before testing was 50%... The adjusted effectiveness of two doses administered at least 28 days before testing was 46%... and administered at least 42 days before testing was 57%... After excluding participants with previous SARS-CoV-2 infections, the adjusted effectiveness of two doses administered at least 14 days before testing was 47%..,” said the Lancet study.According to the Phase 3 clinical trials, for which evaluations were held over a longer period of time, the vaccine had an estimated efficacy of around 65% when Delta variant infections were taken into account. Overall, clinical trials held with 25,000 people showed an efficacy rate of 77.8%.“There is a difference between efficacy studies that are done in controlled settings, and effectiveness of a vaccine that is based on real-world data. I’d say 50% effectiveness is quite good as the results have to be taken in the context of the Covid-19 surge conditions in India during the second Covid wave, combined with the possible immune evasive potential of the delta variant that dominated at that time,” said Dr Manish Soneja, a corresponding author of the study, and additional professor, department of medicine, AIIMS, Delhi.The Delta variant was the dominant strain, accounting for approximately 80% of all confirmed Covid-19 cases.Other experts agreed that 50% effectiveness is acceptable for a vaccine against a respiratory disease.“Actually 50% is the minimum suggested by the World Health Organisation. However, higher the better and Covaxin with its initial reports of 68-70% effectivity was found to be definitely acceptable. The higher efficacy of above 90% or higher came about only after the mRNA platform was introduced. Otherwise traditionally anything above 50% has been acceptable,” said Dr NK Mehra, senior immunologist.The authors in the paper also pointed out that further studies are required in the area, and the current findings add to the growing body of evidence that rapid vaccination programmes remain one of the most promising path to pandemic control.“…this study only assessed symptomatic Covid-19 infections, and further research is needed to determine BBV152 vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation, severe disease, and death,” they said in the paper.Dr Parul Kodan, another author and assistant professor of medicine at AIIMS, Delhi, said, “More research is needed to better understand how these findings translate to BBV152’s effectiveness against delta and other variants of concern, especially related to severe Covid-19 infection, hopsitalisation, and death.”On November 12, the Phase 3 clinical trials data of Covaxin was published in the Lancet journal, which showed 77.8% efficacy against symptomatic Covid-19 cases, and 93.4% efficacy against severe symptomatic disease.The report also reaffirms that the efficacy data of the whole virion inactivated vaccine demonstrates 63.6% protection against asymptomatic disease, and 65.2% protection against the Sars-Cov-2, B.1.617.2 against Delta variant.The vaccine received emergency use authorisation from India’s drugs regulator in January this year, and on November 3, it was granted World Health Organization’s Emergency Use Listing, enabling countries to expedite their regulatory approval to import and administer doses.The vaccine was developed in partnership with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the National Institute of Virology, Pune, with Bharat Biotech receiving the Sars-CoV-2 strains isolated by the government’s apex virology laboratory in March 2020.Covaxin manufacturers Bharat Biotech didn’t comment on the report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covaxin-50-effective-against-delta-variant-real-world-study-101637696275411.html
25-11-2021||Today's||Our Constitution: A sacred document||India is the largest functioning democracy in the world by size; its pluralistic character and democratic values have stood the test of time. Democratic traditions and tenets have remained an integral part of the glorious legacy of Indian civilisation. The virtues of equality, tolerance, and peaceful coexistence have been an intrinsic part of our society for centuries. Democracy is deeply rooted in our socio-political conscience. Our freedom struggle was a mass movement based on the doctrines of truth and non-violence. Our freedom fighters dreamt of a free and prosperous India and an inclusive society based on social and economic justice. After a long-drawn-out struggle, we gained Independence and their collective vision guided us. Post-Independence, when our founding fathers framed the Constitution, they incorporated in it the cardinal values of liberty, equality, fraternity, and justice. Given the size and diversity of the country, it was an enormous task to frame the sacred document, which would guide the nation on the path of unity and prosperity while preserving its democratic framework. The drafters had three primary goals: Safeguarding the unity and integrity of the nation; establishing the principles of liberty, equality and fraternity among the people; and laying the groundwork for institutions focused on paving the way for economic and social equality. With their prudence, wisdom, conviction and deep association with the people, our founding fathers were not only successful in drafting a modern and enlightened contract between the State and its citizens but bequeathed us a Constitution, which, while retaining an inviolable core, is at the same time flexible enough to adjust to the requirements of changing times. We, as a nation, have faced numerous challenges of a diverse nature, but our Constitution has helped us to successfully surmount these. It not only establishes the rule of law in the country, but also serves to distribute powers between the Union and the states, strengthens democratic Institutions, and empowers the most vulnerable and marginalised. The success of India’s parliamentary democracy rests on the robust edifice and institutional framework that the Constitution lays down. November 26 holds a special significance for us as a nation, as this was the day in 1949 on which our Constituent Assembly adopted the Constitution, running into 90,000 words. In 2015, on the occasion of 125th birth anniversary of BR Ambedkar, chairman of the Drafting Committee of Constitution, the Union Government declared November 26 as Samvidhan Divas or Constitution Day.The most distinctive feature of the Constitution is its timeless ideals enshrined in a resilient framework. It is not merely an intangible ideal, but a living document. The Indian Constitution has enabled us to establish social, economic democracy and political democracy. It has been the most powerful instrument of social and economic change. Our Constitution has been responding to the changing hopes, aspirations and circumstances, always evolving with time. Our parliamentary democracy has grown from strength to strength in the past 72 years. As we look back at our journey spanning seven decades, we feel proud for not only having upheld the Constitution, but also for having revitalised and strengthened its democratic tenor. People have always been at the centre of our constitutional, democratic polity and India is seen as a shining example of a vibrant and pluralistic culture flourishing in an ever-evolving parliamentary system. Our governance is focused on building an inclusive and prosperous State as envisaged in the preamble to the Constitution, an approach that has helped empower common people as confident citizens of a proud nation, not just passive observers or mere beneficiaries. It goes to the credit of our constitutional governance structure and the credibility that it enjoys that after each of the 17 general elections and scores of state elections, the transition of power has always been smooth and seamless. Each election has only served to further strengthen our democracy and reinforced people’s faith in our Constitution. Our Constitution lays down the road map for the process of nation-building, but it is up to us as citizens to decide the pace. It is up to us to show our true commitment to our constitutional values by contributing to the huge endeavours of governments to reach the benefits of social, economic and political development to those at the lowest rung of the society. Each of us will have to understand our Charter of Duties laid down in the Constitution, which provides for a unique balance between rights and duties. After 75 years of Independence, it is time to reaffirm our commitment to our fundamental duties. As we celebrate “Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav”, it is time for us to introspect on how we can contribute to the process of nation-building so that our nation can be a major player in the global economy with an inclusive and egalitarian society. I have no doubt that the Constitution of India will be our guide, friend and philosopher in this task.Our Constitution is a sacred document and everyone should be fully committed to its ideals. It imposes a sacred duty upon all the organs of State to be sensitive to the hopes and aspirations of the citizen. For the smooth functioning of our parliamentary system, it is important for each of the three organs of the State — the judiciary, legislature and executive — to work within the ambit of the constitutional mandate without infringing on each other’s powers and in close coordination with, and due respect for the others.On the sacrosanct occasion of “Samvidhan Divas”, let us recommit ourselves to the goals of our freedom movement and the ideals, dreams and visions of our founding fathers and resolve to fulfill them.

25-11-2021||Today's||Ensuring clean energy with people’s participation||Today, the world is rapidly embracing clean energy. An increasing number of governments are renegotiating their dependence on fossil fuels to meet their energy needs through clean energy. Madhya Pradesh (MP) is one of the first states to pioneer solar energy production in India. Our commitment towards ushering in a clean future has been driven by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s mantra of “Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas, Sabka Prayas”. This mantra drives the idea of Jan Bhagidari, people’s participation, for change, which will be crucial in ushering in a green future, powered by solar energy.India is taking great strides towards achieving its ambitious target of about 500 Gigawatt (GW) of installed renewable energy capacity by 2030. Out of this, the contribution of solar energy is expected to be around 280 GW, or 60%.In order to reach this target, we must make this a people’s movement at all levels. We cannot forget that our efforts to reach the goal of a billion vaccinations were also driven by the spirit of Jan Bhagidaari. I believe that energy consciousness will come only when energy-saving becomes a part of our daily existence. Hence, I have pioneered the world’s largest energy literacy programme, Urja Saksharta Abhiyan (USHA), to build an energy-conscious society. Under USHA, we will reach out to students, homemakers, businesspeople, farmers, and others sections of society.As a next step in our aim to engage the public, we have reached out to our farmer brothers and sisters to take this movement to the grassroots. Hence, under the PM-KUSUM Yojana, we are helping our farmers set-up solar power generation units on their lands at subsidised rates. This will also provide them an additional source of income.We have also been taking technology-focused measures to put MP on the map as the leading producer of solar power. Our efforts have increased the contribution of clean energy to 25% of MP’s current installed power capacity of 21,700 MW. This is a ten-fold increase from 2012. Our aim is to become number one in the production of solar energy and build a strong clean energy future, under our Atmanirbhar Madhya Pradesh Roadmap 2023.On Thursday, we have successfully executed the Rewa Solar Power Project. This project has become a model for many other states. It is one of the world’s largest single-site solar projects, generating 750 MW of electricity per day at its full capacity. We have achieved a minimum tariff of ₹2.97/unit, which is considerably less than the tariff received from other concurrent projects. This has also proved that alternative energy can be produced cheaply if executed with a strong political will, efficient implementation, and the spirit of Jan Bhagidari.Our success in tapping solar energy, in a state that receives over 300 days of sunshine, has empowered our will to apply our past learning to future projects. Consequently, we are aggressively setting up solar energy parks in other districts such as Neemuch, Shajapur, Agar, Morena, Chhatarpur and Sagar as well, with a combined capacity of 4,500 MW, at a construction cost of ₹18,000 crore. However, in its first phase, we have initiated the construction of the 1,500 MW Agar-Shajapur-Neemuch Solar Power Project, at a cost of ₹5,250 crore. We will continue our winning streak by getting a low power tariff of ₹2.14/unit in this project, too.We will supply this low-priced electricity generated through the National Grid Connectivity to the Indian Railways in eight states, besides the Delhi Metro. These solar parks will be operational at full capacity by March 2023 and boost our dream of building an Atmanirbhar MP.These solar parks will also help state power companies save about ₹7,600 crore during the project period. It will provide indirect employment to about 7,500 people during project construction, and direct employment to 1,800 locals after operationalisation. Besides economic and power benefits, this project will prevent CO2 emissions of up to three million tonnes annually. This is equivalent to planting 52 million adult trees.We are employing international best practices in solar power production from countries such as Germany, South Korea and Norway to increase Madhya Pradesh’s footprint in the renewable energy sector. In this direction, we have initiated construction of the world’s largest floating solar park in Omkareshwar on the Narmada River. It is expected to produce 600 MW of renewable energy, at a construction cost of about ₹3,000 crore.Madhya Pradesh will continue to explore new ways of tapping into this eternal source of energy. We will leave no stone unturned to bring the life-giving power of Suryadev to the doorstep of every citizen of India and make India an energy-conscious and truly Atmanirbhar nation by 2030.Shivraj Singh Chouhan is the chief minister of Madhya PradeshThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/ensuring-clean-energy-with-people-s-participation-101637829147525.html
