Of the 172 locations, Covaxin will be administered at four areas in Pataudi and Covishield will be administered everywhere else. “Our focus is on vaccinating all people who are yet to take the vaccine against Covid-19. The door-to-door campaign will continue till the end of November--we aim to cover the maximum possible population. On Monday, teams will cover 172 locations across the district for door-to-door vaccination,” said Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer. The campaign began on November 2--on the first two days, over 800 residents were vaccinated. The campaign was paused from November 4-5 for Diwali holidays. On Sunday, 5,738 people were administered the Covid-19 vaccine in the district, said officials, with 1,109 people being administered the first dose and 4,629 being given the second dose of the vaccine. As part of this campaign, in urban areas, three-member teams comprising Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA), auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM) workers and data entry operators will visit residential areas and wait in common spaces such as residents’ welfare association offices, where people can come and get vaccinated. In rural areas, the teams will wait for people at chaupals or in centrally located buildings. Officials said that all primary health centres in the district have conducted surveys at their levels to identify people who have still not taken the vaccine and teams are being formed accordingly. “People will be informed in advance where the teams will wait so that beneficiaries can come and get themselves vaccinated. Residents whose second doses are due will be informed with the help of lists prepared by the primary health centres. This way, residents can get vaccinated at their condominiums or nearby localities. Along with this, vaccination will be done at fixed session sites also,” added Singh. In October, union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya had advised states and Union territories to scale up the national Covid-19 vaccination drive with the door-to-door vaccination campaign ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ over the next month, especially focusing on covering beneficiaries due for their second dose. At present, 77.2% of the population has been administered both vaccine doses in the district. In Gurugram, over 1.78 million people are eligible for the Covid-19 vaccine and over 3.59 million have already been vaccinated. In the district, first-dose vaccination has crossed 100% as several people from other districts and a migrating population have also been vaccinated in Gurugram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/doortodoor-covid-jabs-drive-to-be-held-in-172-areas-in-gurugram-today-101636309551498.html

The municipal corporation also decided that ward committees would carry out decentralised waste management, and asked the members to collaborate with local residents’ welfare associations, market associations, and other groups.Yashpal Yadav, municipal commissioner, Faridabad, said that ward committees will act as change agents to ensure the participation of all stakeholders and take ownership of areas under their jurisdiction. “We have procured 110 vehicles to collect waste in the city. They will be pressed into service from November 10. We have trained manpower and experts, we will help in the smooth collection and disposal of solid waste. Our aim is to ensure 100% door-to-door collection of waste in Faridabad and its segregation at the house itself,” said Yadav.Yadav said that Faridabad generates 600 metric tonnes of waste every day, and the municipal corporation is working to implement 100% waste collection by March 31, 2022. “The waste and garbage in the city and stuck in drains is being removed and this work will be completed by January 31, 2022. This clearing will help prevent waterlogging and sewage leakage,” he said.The corporation, he said, will also launch an awareness drive on the segregation of waste and also collaborate with people at the ground level so that this cleaning and waste management drive is successful.Yadav also appealed to the residents to ensure that waste is handed over to authorised waste collection vehicles so that it is disposed of at designated places. He also said that construction debris and similar waste should also be disposed of in a scientific manner as it becomes a major hazard due to poor disposal. “The ward committees have been empowered and they will play important role in the entire exercise. The model we are building in Faridabad focusses on self-governance in urban areas where people can take decisions for themselves,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/faridabad-working-on-100-waste-collection-by-march-2022-municipal-commissioner-101636309370839.html

Supported by an organization, Sunil Dubey aims to dispose of at least 20,000 such idols at Hathi Ghat on Monday. “It is time for new clothes, gifts and new idols of God Ganesh and Goddess Lakshmi on Diwali but discarded idola are just abandoned under ‘peepal’ trees, on foot paths and even in garbage dumps and drains,” said Sunil Dubey (42). “Last year I decided to ensure graceful disposal of these old idols but due to lack of publicity and Covid -19, results were not satisfactory. This time, we planned it in advance and discussed it in a meeting of ‘Brahmin Parishad’. Designated centres were chosen, asking denizens to place old idols there,” he said. ‘The results were encouraging and we began collecting old idols from Saturday onwards. We also picked up old idols lying under ‘peepal’ trees, on footpaths and other places,” he said. “ The Agra Nagar Nigam has extended support and dug the ‘kund’ (well) on Hathi Ghat along river Yamuna where we expect to immerse at least 20,000 pairs of Ganesh Laxmi idols by Monday afternoon. Twenty-one Brahmins would recite ‘mantras’ for ceremonious ‘visarjan’ (disposal) of these idols,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/social-activist-ensures-respectful-disposal-of-discarded-idols-in-agra-101636308951645.html
07-11-2021||Lucknow||Old City monuments hotspot for pre-wedding shoots||After two pandemic waves and small weddings, the winter wedding season is just a week away. With a large number of summer weddings pushed to this season, the week preceding the season is being utilised by would-be brides and grooms for the pre-wedding shoots with the historic monuments in the city turning out to be their favourite destinations for providing a perfect backdrop. Visit any Old City monument in the Hussainabad section in the early morning hours these days, one will find a team of photographers capturing would-be brides and grooms. Specially dressed for the occasion, with make-up artistes doing the touch-ups, the young couples-to-be are seen striking poses against Rumi Darwaza, Picture Gallery, Clock Tower and against the backdrop of Gomti river at the majestic Kudiya Ghat. “The big-fat weddings have shrunk to small personalised affairs, so pre-wedding portfolio shoots have become a big affair. When shooting in Lucknow, the historic monuments and some modern structures like Gomti Riverfront, Ambedkar Park and Janeshwar Mishra Park have become the most sought-after spots,” says young lensman Dev Singh. Software engineer Prakhar Sinha, who is getting married on November 21, says, “Ours is a small day-wedding with a 150-person reception in the night. Since all the wedding ceremonies will be solemnised on the same day so we are getting a pre-wedding shoot done. My elder brother, before his marriage, too got a pre-wedding shoot done at the majestic Dilkusha Gardens. Unfortunately, they are not allowing wedding shoots there, so we have zeroed upon the signature of Lucknow — Rumi Darwaza, which looks beautiful in morning lights.” The trend can be gauged by the fact that many have added pre-wedding shoots to their do-list off late. “Mostly pre-wedding shoots are a part of a complete wedding package, but this year many engaged us, just before the marriage season, as a standalone assignment. People have realised that they can use his shoot pictures in their virtual invitation cards, save the date invitation and social media posts and reels. Also, outstation relatives who can’t visit marriages are sent these cinematic films,” tells lensman Amit Saheta. The Kudiya Ghat bank with old-world charm and Gomti Riverfront in the Gomti Nagar area with the modern feel gives an amazing contrast, he adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/old-city-monuments-hotspot-for-pre-wedding-shoots-101636308531432.html

The Sectors 74 to 79 in Noida are known as 7X. Noida traffic inspector Ashutosh Singh said police teams asked motorists to follow traffic rules. “People also took an oath of following traffic rules,” said Singh. Brajesh Sharma, a resident of Antriksh Golf View 2 in Noida’s Sector 78, and a member of 7X Welfare Team, said traffic volunteers reached Hajipur T-Point holding a placard bearing messages on traffic rules. “When the red light of the traffic signal was on, we approached people driving car without a seatbelt and motorcycle riders without helmets and sensitized them about traffic rules. They promised to follow traffic rules in future,” he said. Sharma said that the violation of seatbelt and helmet rule is the main reason for casualties in an accident. “We advised people to put on their safety gear while driving vehicles. We also told them to drive carefully during foggy weather conditions,” he said. On Saturday, a programme was organised at Jewar toll plaza to sensitize motorists travelling on the Yamuna Expressway. Data from the Noida transport department shows that from January 1 to August 31 this year, 238 people died while 348 were injured in 501 accidents in the district.

The grandmother of the infant had handed over the baby to the woman for a bit as she had to take her daughter to the washroom. On returning, she found the woman and the baby missing. It was later found that the woman, who had taken away the baby, was mentally ill. She suffers from epilepsy and had come to the hospital with her four-year-old son for treatment. “The woman’s son had wandered out of the ward. She followed him and reached home, without returning the new-born to her kin,” said inspector Satpal, station house officer, Division Number 2 police station.“Later when she realised that she had brought someone else’s baby home, she herself returned to the hospital to return the child,” said the SHO. “After reaching home in Sunet village, the woman’s four-year-old son rang up his father, who is a security guard, and told him that the mother had brought home some child. The man asked her to return the baby to her parents, following which she returned to the hospital and handed over the newborn to her parents,” said the SHO.Narinder Kumar, father of the newborn girl, said, “We came to know that the four-year-old son of the woman had got her to return our baby. How can we send the boy’s mother to jail when he helped us be reunited with our daughter.”The inspector said no FIR was registered as the family withdrew the complaint.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-newborn-s-family-withdraws-plaint-as-abductor-suffers-from-mental-illness-101636307569742.html
07-11-2021||Lucknow||‘Vehicular movement, drop in temp behind smog blanket over Lucknow’||Lucknow Post Diwali and Bhai dooj, a thick layer of smog enveloped the state capital, reducing visibility. Experts said vehicular movement was on its peak due to the festival season and the weather conditions were favourable for a spike in air pollutants. According to experts, since the temperature is going down, particulate matters are suspended in air and low wind speed is not allowing the dust to disperse. They say increased vehicular pollution and drop in temperature has led to this situation which is now becoming common in this season, especially in north India. Professor Venkatesh Dutta of Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University, Lucknow said, “The changing temperature and slow and stable winds trap soot,dust and fine particulate matter. The particulate matter is present in a variety of sizes ranging from coarse and fine to ultrafine.” “Most important to note are PM2.5 (particles with a size less than 2.5 micrometres). These particles are emitted by various sources like industrial exhausts, vehicular emissions, rapid construction, stubble burning and burning of waste material etc. They are considered to be the most dangerous because they can stay in the atmosphere longer due to light weight and small size, thereby increasing the chances of humans and animals inhaling them which and eventually leads to respiratory and cardio-vascular disorders,” he said. Prof Datta adds, “The road conditions are not good and lead to a lot of dust emissions during traffic hours. These emissions also hang around the air at breathing heights, causing severe health hazards.” Former director, Geological Survey of India, VK Joshi said, “Being a geologist by training and profession, I am a firm believer in the dictum ‘Present is a key to the past and past is a window of the future.’ Around 5.4 million years ago there was unprecedented Global Warming, leading to intense heat and climate change somewhat similar to the present, but temperatures, rainfall and cardon dioxide content of the atmosphere were much more. Alas, we were not there to take the blame!” “Around 40% of the problem during this time and the ensuing winter is caused by us, while 60% of the misdeed is done by nature. We believe that we are the sole rulers of the planet. It is not so. There are several others too controlling our climate.The pollution by firecrackers is a municipal problem and should be sorted out accordingly. But there are other issues too which need the attention of the local bodies,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/vehicular-movement-drop-in-temp-behind-smog-blanket-over-lucknow-101636307509995.html
07-11-2021||Noida||Noida’s Sector 71 underpass now open for motorists||The Noida authority opened the sector 51/71 six-lane underpass project on Sunday evening to the public, offering seamless connectivity to commuters travelling between Noida and Greater Noida west. “We have opened both sides of the underpass for public use. We only need to complete the painting work, that will be over in the next 15 days,” said Mukesh Vaish, project engineer of Noida authority.The underpass will now facilitate a smooth ride for commuters over Vikas Marg, the arterial road linking Noida to Greater Noida West as well as Vishwakarma Marg, which connects the Noida expressway in the city with Indirapuram in Ghaziabad. The underpass will also benefit newly developed group housing societies in Noida’s Sector 51, Hoshiyarpur, Sectors 74 to 79 as well as Greater Noida West. It will provide a smooth ride to at least 50,000 daily commuters, said officials. In June 2019, the authority started work on the 780 metre long underpass corridor at an estimated cost of ₹59 crore, setting December 2020 as the deadline for completion. Since then, the project missed two more deadlines -- March 2021 and June 2021.One of the key traffic intersections of Noida, this spot in sector 51/71 used to witness long traffic snarls in the absence of a seamless underpass. Now, commuters travelling from Noida to Greater Noida, Ghaziabad side to Dadri road will not have to wait at this junction. The underpass will also ease commuting for residents who travel within the city.However, residents of Sector 51 are still not happy with the opening of the underpass because some work on their side is yet to be completed.“The authority is yet to complete slab work next to the Sector 51 corner. We will not be able to take a U-turn to reach Sector 51’s blocks D, E, F and Hoshiyarpur above this underpass. We will have to drive longer and face congestion till the work on this corner is completed,” said Sanjiv Kumar , general secretary of Sector 51 residents’ welfare association. “We will complete remaining work in next four to five days and ensure all the pending issues are resolved,” said Vaish.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noidas-sector-71-underpass-now-open-for-motorists-101636307269635.html

Police tried to divert traffic to other roads, but commuters were stuck in the jam due to the rush on internal roads.Abhiraj Singh of Model Town, a commuter, said he had gone to see the Diwali Mela with his family, but got stuck in the jam for at least an hour. Pankaj Sharma, another commuter, said blocking roads is not a solution to any problem. “It is sad that such protests have become a routine affair.”Bhavandeep Singh, one of the protesters, said, “We had been protesting peacefully near Samrala Chowk to seek the arrest of Anil Arora, however, police is deliberately delaying the accused’s arrest. So, we decided to block traffic at Bharat Nagar Chowk.”Additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP, City 3) Sameer Verma said, “Police made diversions near ESIC Chowk, Mall Road, Bhai Bala Chowk and Jagraon Bridge to ensure smooth traffic flow. The agitators ended their protest on their own after two hours.”Anil Arora was booked for hurting religious statements on October 20 after an audio of him purportedly making some objectionable statements went viral on social media. Police have arrested at least six people for allegedly sheltering the accused. A cash reward of ₹1 lakh has also been announced on his head.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-commuters-hassled-as-protesters-lay-siege-to-bharat-nagar-chowk-101636306729667.html

Otherwise, how can Subrata Mondal in Gosaba and Udayan Guha in Dinhata win by such a huge margin? I have information that the EVM used in Behala Purba constituency (during the assembly elections) earlier this year was counted in Gosaba," Adhikari said at a function in Kolkata.Guha won the Dinhata bypoll by a record margin of 1.64 lakh while Mondal emerged victorious by 1.43 lakh votes from Gosaba. The TMC's Braja Kishore Goswami defeated his nearest BJP rival by 64,675 votes in Santipur, while in the Khardah assembly segment, state minister Sovandeb Chattopadhyay beat the BJP nominee by a margin of 93,832 votes.While BJP leader Nisith Pramanik, who became Union minister later, won the assembly election by a wafer-thin margin of just 57 votes defeating Guha from the Dinhata seat earlier this year, another BJP MP Jagannath Sarkar won by a comfortable margin of 15,878 votes from Santipur. The two, however, resigned as MLAs to keep their memberships in the Lok Sabha after the TMC secured a landslide victory, necessitating the by-polls."In the Santipur College booth, the TMC bagged 478 votes and the BJP 8. There are 20 BJP workers in that booth and the total number of voters in their families is 92. At a booth in Gosaba, one leader has eight voters in his family but the BJP got only one vote. How are these possible?" Adhikari said, indicating malpractices during the bt-elections.The allegations do not make any sense, TMC state spokesperson Kunal Ghosh said."The by-polls were held under the Election Commission's supervision. The counting took place under tight security by central force personnel. Adhikari is cooking up such absurd stories hide BJP leaders' failure to stop the quick erosion of support base after tall claims made before the assembly elections," he said.After the by-polls, the tally of the TMC in the state assembly rose to 217, while that of the BJP came down to 75.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/evms-changed-before-counting-in-bengal-by-polls-bjp-s-suvendu-adhikari-101636305331771.html
07-11-2021||Kolkata||BJP worker killed in Bengal; TMC denies charge of post-poll violence||The West Bengal unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alleged on Sunday that one of its workers was murdered by Trinamool Congress (TMC) supporters at Bhagabanpur in East Midnapore district on Saturday night and demanded a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The ruling party denied the charge, saying the victim, Sambhu Maity, was killed because of infighting in the BJP. Maity was head of the BJP’s local unit at Muhammadpur in the Bhagabanpur 1 community block. The allegation was raised while the BJP’s central executive body held a meeting in Delhi in presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. At the meeting, BJP national president JP Nadda alleged that post-poll violation in Bengal has claimed the lives of 57 party workers so far. Maity’s body, which bore marks of injury, was found in a desolate place, said the local police. It was sent for postmortem examination and handed over to the family on Sunday evening. “An investigation has started,” said a district police officer who did not want to be named. BJP Lok Sabha member and state general secretary Jyotirmoy Singh Mahato, who led a procession with the body, declared a 12-hour bandh at Bhagabanpur on Monday. “We demand a CBI probe. Maity was abducted from the road near his home around 9.30 pm on Saturday. Post-poll violence, into which the Calcutta high court ordered a CBI probe, is continuing,” said Mahato. Cabinet minister and legislator from the district, Soumen Mahapatra, dismissed the allegation. “TMC had nothing to do with the death. It was the fallout of a dispute between two local groups,” said Mahapatra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bjp-worker-killed-in-bengal-tmc-denies-charge-of-post-poll-violence-101636306310554.html

07-11-2021||Chandigarh||Sidhu playing manipulative politics: SAD||Amid a row between advocate general Amar Preet Singh Deol and Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) chief Navjot Singh Sidhu, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has hit out at Sidhu for “playing manipulative politics”.SAD spokesman Maheshinder Singh Grewal said Sidhu’s father was advocate Bhagwant Singh, a Congress leader who fought cases against his own government. “Not so long ago Sidhu and his wife were elected representatives of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and could be seen mocking at Congress leaders. They continued to do so even after they joined the Congress. By that standard, Sidhu should also resign from the post PPCC chief,” said Grewal while reacting to Sidhu’s criticism over Deol’s appointment.Deol, 61, had shot into limelight earlier this year when he secured the release of former director general of police (DGP) Sumedh Singh Saini, arrested by the vigilance bureau in a 2020 criminal case. Deol had appeared for Saini, among other accused, in the 2015 sacrilege cases before the Punjab and Haryana high court.The SAD asked the Congress government to not engage in “disruptive politics” at the cost of the people. It also challenged the government to get the issue of power purchase agreements (PPAs) probed by any independent agency of its choice.Asking the government not to do politics on an issue which could harm the people, Maheshinder Grewal said passing resolutions to cancel the PPAs in the forthcoming special session of the Vidhan Sabha was a meaningless exercise.“The Vidhan Sabha neither proposed the PPAs nor ratified them. They were contracts between the Punjab government and private companies. They were executed on the basis of guidelines proposed and approved by the UPA government headed by then Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh. Keeping these facts in mind, it is clear that state assembly does not have any role to play on this issue and in case the government intends to cancel the PPAs, they should do so through an executive order instead of misleading people through empty resolutions”, Grewal.The SAD leader also questioned the Congress government’s intention to pass resolutions on the issue of extension of jurisdiction of the Border Security Force (BSF) and the three farm laws.He said the Vidhan Sabha had already passed a resolution under the leadership of Capt Amarinder Singh, calling for repudiation of the three farm laws. “Now another resolution is being passed on the same issue under Charanjit Singh Channi’s leadership. The government must tell Punjabis the difference between both resolutions and how they will help them,” Grewal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sidhu-playing-manipulative-politics-sad-101636305951525.html

Saikia, the younger brother of Congress legislator and leader of opposition in Assam assembly Debabrata Saikia, was arrested from his Soru Motoria residence in Guwahati following a raid at the premise by the agency. As per details provided by the family, the case pertains to a loan worth ₹9.37 lakh which Ashok Saikia had taken from the Assam State Cooperative And Rural Development (ASCARD) Bank in 1996. “I repaid the entire amount in 2011 which was acknowledged by the bank through a letter in October 2015. Today, the CBI team arrived at our house without any prior intimation and notice and mentioned that I have dues to pay the bank,” Ashok Saikia said in a statement. “Only the government or the investigating agency would know why I have been detained in a baseless and incorrect allegation,” the statement added. Saikia is to be produced in court on Monday. Debabrata Saikia also reiterated that the family, including the late CM’s wife who stays at the house, had not received any notice or intimation from the CBI about the case before Sunday’s raid and arrest. “I have been told by our advocates that CBI shouldn’t have intervened in the case as the loan amount has already been repaid in 2011. Legal proceedings, if any, with regard to it is going on in court. The CBI says they served a notice to my brother, but we haven’t received it,” Debabrata Saikia said. “If the bank lodged a case with the CBI for recovery of unpaid loans, they should have intimated the agency that my brother has already repaid his loan. We are confident that we will get justice from the court,” he added. The CBI hasn’t issued any statement in connection with the development and officials of the agency were not available for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cbi-arrests-former-assam-cm-histeswar-saikia-s-son-in-alleged-bank-fraud-case-101636304990969.html
07-11-2021||Noida||Son was in Indian territorial limits: Mother of fisherman killed by Pak Navy||“My son was inside the Indian territorial limits,” said an emotional Anusha Chamre, whose 32-year-old son Shridhar, was reportedly shot several times on chest by Pakistan Navy’s marine commandos on Saturday afternoon at the maritime boundary between the two countries near Okha in Gujarat’s Dwarka district. Shridhar lived in Vadrai fishing village at Palghar. “My son was employed with Jayantilal Rathod, a boat owner, as a khalasi (fish labourer) three months ago. On October 26, Rathod’s boat Jalpari set sail and was to return to coast soon,” said Shridhar’s father Ramesh, who was also a fisherman. “We also heard that the Pakistan Navy has kidnapped six Indian fishermen and seized one boat, but we are not sure about it,” said Ramesh. “Another member on the boat, Dilip Tandel, also sustained a gunshot wound and is being treated at an Okha hospital,” said Rathod, speaking to HT from Gujarat.Sunil Joshi, superintendent of police (SP), Dwarka, said a first information report under section 303 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) has been registered against the Pakistani Navy Marine commandos.“As the incident occurred at the high seas, the case has been registered at Navi Bunder Coastal police station in Porbander. We are awaiting the post-mortem report of the body and are investigating further,” he added.Shridhar’s body was sent for post mortem at a Jamnagar government hospital and is expected to reach Palghar by Monday evening, Manendra Arekar, vice-president of Maharashtra Machimar Kriti Samiti, a forum for fishworkers’ welfare, has informed. “We are protesting against the entire incident and demand compensation to Shridhar’s family both from the Centre and the state, as the victim is survived by his two daughters and wife. Their future is bleak; Shridhar used to work on a meagre wage of ₹600 per day,” said Arekar. “The fishermen were within the Indian territorial limits and there was no need for the Pakistani Navy to fire on them. There are no specific marks to differentiate between Indian and Pakistani waters but we do have GPS (global positioning system) which warns us if we trespass into another territory. There are chances that owing to gusty winds, the GPS may have malfunctioned, but the Indian fishermen know their territorial limits and won’t trespass into Pakistani waters,” said Arekar. Jatin Desai, member of Pakistan India Peoples’ Forum For Peace and Democracy, has called the killed a murder by the Pakistani marine commandos. “We condemn the firing. As per the UN (United Nations) Convention of Law of Seas, those who encroach upon the waters can’t even be arrested, leave alone firing by Indian or Pakistan Maritime agencies. It is high time that the Ministry of External Affairs, Indian Coast Guard and the Pakistan’s Maritime Security Agency (MSA) have a dialogue on this issue, specifically as it is a violation of human rights and the UN Convention,” said Desai Due to such incidents, in the Saurashtra region particularly, the fishing community’s economy has been hit severely. “Such incidents create an atmosphere of fear within the fishing community and they will hesitate to go to the sea in the future, which will ultimately affect the fishing industry as a whole,” said Desai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/son-was-in-indian-territorial-limits-mother-of-fisherman-killed-by-pakistani-navy-101636304869493.html

There is a need for increasing the farmers’ income through various sources, including improved resource use efficiency,” Naidu said. The vice president also pitched for greater use of technology in the agriculture sector.Naidu also inaugurated newly built campus of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya College of Horticulture and Forestry and called upon students to work in the larger interest of the nation.He said the country has witnessed degeneration in all walks of life namely politics, legislation, local body institutions owing to the vested interests.

07-11-2021||Mumbai||‘Firefighting system of Kandivli high-rise was not operational; bldg to get notice’||A day after two people died in the blaze that broke out in the ground-plus-15 Hansa Heritage building in Kandivli (West), the Mumbai Fire Brigade (MFB) has claimed that the structure’s internal firefighting system was not operational at the time of the incident. Owing to the absence of the firefighting system, the blaze that broke out in one of the flats on the 14th floor around 8.30pm, spread rapidly to the floor above too. It was doused after more than three hours.The victims have been identified as Ranjanben Parekh, 90, and Nita Parekh, 64, both of whom were occupants of the 14th floor flat. MFB had rescued five of a family from the 14th floor flat, following the blaze.Chief fire officer Hemant Parab said, “A notice will be served to the building for not having an operational firefighting system in place. The system was supplied water from an overhead tank. Due to the gravity, water was supplied to the firefighting system only for the first few minutes. Once the pressure ran out, the firefighting system did not work. The blaze was doused using the fire brigade’s machinery only.” The notice will be served under section 6 of the Maharashtra Fire Prevention and Life Safety Act, 2006, which mandates that it the responsibility of the building owner or occupiers to ensure fire safety within the premises.Saturday’s incident comes two weeks after a massive fire was reported on the 19th floor of the 60-storey Avighna Park in south Mumbai’s Currey Road area, in which one person was killed. Authorities have claimed that the firefighting system of Avighna Park, too, was not functional at the time of the incident.Mayor Kishori Pednekar, who had visited the building premises in Kandivli on Saturday, said, “According to the information given to me, the fire started owing to a diya kept in the balcony on the 14th floor.” However, on Sunday the fire brigade said that the cause of the fire will be confirmed after a preliminary inquiry is conducted.“The five residents rescued by the fire brigade are not in a state to talk, as they are in shock. A team of fire officials visited the spot on Sunday to begin with the preliminary inquiries. The [complete] inquiry will be done after recording eyewitness accounts. This may give us an insight on where the fire originated, how it spread, and what was the exact cause,” Parab said.He said that MFB personnel who had entered the two-bedroom flat on the 14th floor saw that the curtains and couch in the living room had caught fire. The five family members of the 14th floor flat had locked themselves in a bedroom and opened a window. When the personnel entered the bedroom, the bed had also caught fire, said Parab. He said, “These five people were rescued from the room. The two elderly women who died were unable to walk owing to their health and thus may not have been able to save themselves.”Local legislator Yogesh Sagar said, “I spoke to the family and was told that both the victims were bedridden.”MFB got 159 calls in 1 weekBetween November 1 and 6, MFB received 65 calls, wherein fires had broken out owing to crackers, information by the fire brigade revealed. On a whole, MFB had received 159 calls between November 1 and November 6. On November 1 and 2, MFB one call each, informing them of fires owing to crackers, and on November 3, they got four such calls. On the day of Diwali on November 4, MFB had received 33 fire calls related to crackers and a total of 62 calls. The following day, they received 19 calls related to firecrackers, and on November 6, MFB got seven such calls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/firefighting-system-of-kandivli-high-rise-was-not-operational-bldg-to-get-notice-101636303429279.html

The police were identifying the troublemakers and would initiate stern action, he said. Denying any firing inside the jail, he said people, however, heard some loud sounds. One inmate died and 30 policemen were injured, he said.“It is not clear yet how the inmate died, it will be investigated,” he said.District magistrate Sanjay Kumar said an inquiry has been ordered into the incident. The damage to the jail property was being assessed and stern action would be taken against those responsible for the violence, he added.The situation was controlled in time by the police and security has further been beefed up, he said.The authorities suspect the violence was a cover for a jailbreak and inmates tried to bring down the main gate. Certain top criminals lodged in the jail are said to have instigated this violence.Sandip had died in the district hospital on Saturday night. Alleging that he was not treated properly and sent to hospital belatedly, his family created a ruckus in his hometown Saifai in Etawah district of Uttar Pradesh.The news of Sandip’s death angered the inmates inside the jail. As they were asked to come out of their barracks at 7am, the inmates went berserk. They first held a jail warden captive and assaulted him. Eyewitnesses told the authorities that two deputy jailers Ashish Kumar and Shailesh Sonkar, who were trying to pacify the prisoners, were also taken captive and beaten up. Within an hour, the prisoners were in control of the entire jail.As the situation went out of control, the Farrukhabad police were informed around 10am. Three circle officers were sent with heavy police contingent to control the situation. Owing to heavy brick batting from the rooftops, the police teams could not reach the main gates for an hour.The police had to fire teargas shells to make their way into the jail and take strategic positions. The police allegedly resorted to firing and lathi-charge to disperse the inmates, who were unrelenting.One inmate identified as Shivam was allegedly hit by a bullet. He was rushed to Saifai where he was declared dead on arrival.The 30 policemen injured in the violence were admitted in different hospitals.Apart from Sandip’s death, the inmates were said to be angry with the jail administration over other issues. During talks with the officials, they said jail administration did not open barrack doors on Diwali and, as a result, they could not greet one another. Nor were they given quality food, which is provided to them every year during the festival, they claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/prisoners-run-riot-in-fatehgarh-jail-one-dead-30-police-personnel-injured-101636303130799.html
07-11-2021||Lucknow||Mayawati hits back at Samajwadi Party, says induction of expelled BSP leaders will weaken it||Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati on Sunday hit back at the Samajwadi Party (SP) after two expelled BSP leaders Lalji Verma and Ramachal Rajbhar joined the Akhilesh Yadav-led party at a rally in Uttar Pradesh.The inclusion of expelled leaders of the BSP and other rival parties would not increase the SP’s support base but would weaken it further, Mayawati said in a series of tweets.Several Samajwadi Party leaders aspiring for the party ticket in the coming assembly election were in contact with the BSP leadership after the SP opened its doors for the expelled leaders of other parties, Mayawati claimed.The Samajwadi Party should know that ticket seekers in its own party were now angry after the induction of such selfish leaders eager to defect to other parties, BSP chief Mayawati said. The defectors joining the Samajwadi Party are going to cause a lot of damage to this party from within in the coming assembly election, Mayawati said.Mayawati made it clear that she was not eager to open the BSP’s doors to the defectors from other parties who wished to join the BSP after being denied tickets for the assembly election. Rather, the BSP will give the party ticket to its own leaders instead of defectors, she said.In a separate tweet, Mayawati demanded withdrawal of the Centre’s three new farm laws.For the first time in three years, the Central government has given some relief to the people on Diwali by reducing the excise duty slightly on petrol and diesel, Mayawati noted.Similarly, the central government should withdraw the three agricultural laws, she said.Speaking at the Janadesh rally in Ambedkar Nagar district earlier in the day, both Verma and Rajbhar called upon the people to vote the ruling Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) out of power and make Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav the next chief minister by ensuring the SP’s victory in the 2022 assembly election. Verma, who was leader of the BSP legislature party, said the BSP has deviated from ideals of Bhimrao Ambedkar and Kanshi Ram.“I was a founder member of the BSP and worked for 35 years to widen the party’s support,” he said.Ramachal Rajbhar, who was national general secretary of the BSP, alleged that the BSP chief had humiliated him.“Before taking action, she did not hear us. A large number of the BSP leaders and workers are deserting the party to join the SP,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/mayawati-hits-back-at-samajwadi-party-says-induction-of-expelled-bsp-leaders-will-weaken-it-101636303069139.html

CBI officials have also included some other disputes pertaining to Mahant Narendra Giri in the ambit of their investigation as these could be related to his death as well. The probe team recently collected related documents from his lawyer.Officials aware of the developments in the ongoing investigation said CBI officials have also issued notices to 18 people for questioning till now.CBI officials have informed the court that the investigation is in the preliminary stage and all evidence is being examined properly.Mahant Narendra Giri’s body was found hanging in a room at his Math in Prayagraj on September 20. An autopsy was carried out and viscera was preserved and then sent to a forensic science lab (FSL) for examinations. The rope from which his body was found hanging and scissors collected from that room were also sent for detailed examination to FSL. Mahant Narendra Giri’s purported suicide note found in the room is under examination by handwriting experts. CBI is yet to receive the reports of examination of evidence by FSL and handwriting experts. Instead, CBI has collected samples of signatures of Mahant Narendra Giri made in his will and other documents to match it with the signature and the handwriting of Narendra Giri on the purported suicide note. “CBI team is focusing on the suicide angle and is waiting for reports of FSL to reach any concrete conclusion. Moreover, CBI officials have till now grilled persons related to Narendra Giri and the Math along with people close to Anand Giri and other two suspects of the case,” said a senior police official privy to the investigation. The new persons whose names surfaced during the probe were also called for questioning. Some more persons may soon be quizzed too, he added. After the case was referred to CBI, an FIR was lodged by agency officials in Delhi. The case may soon be transferred to the CBI court in Lucknow. Officials said that in such circumstances, Anand Giri, former priest of Bade Hanuman Temple Aadya Tiwari and his son Sandeep may be shifted from the Naini central jail in Prayagraj to the Lucknow jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/mahant-narendra-giri-death-case-cbi-questions-170-people-during-ongoing-probe-101636302949184.html

07-11-2021||Chandigarh||Dera Bassi: Decade on, Punjab local bodies department scraps waste mgmt project||After a decade, the Punjab local bodies department has scrapped the solid waste management project at Samgoli in Dera Bassi. In December last year, the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) had backed out.A senior officer of the local bodies department, who wished not to be named, said that the local bodies of Mohali district have already constructed waste resource management centres. The wet waste dumped in pits will eventually be organically converted to manure, which can be further sold to increase the income of civic bodies. So, there is no need for a solid waste management plant, he said.He said that now, the state government is looking for the latest technology, through which refuse-derived fuel (RDF) or by-products of waste can be used to make coal to be sold to thermal plants in the state.In March last year, the Punjab government had approved handing over the construction and operations of the ‘waste to energy plant to NTPC. The state government had also given approval to the local bodies department for an MoU between NTPC and the Mohali municipal corporation (MC), being the nodal agency, for the execution of the project. But, the project did not materialise.The project has been hanging fire for the past decade. Mohali MC had prepared the detailed project report (DPR) 11 years back at a cost of ₹100 crore, including the land cost.Currently, Mohali is generating 150 metric tonnes (MT) of garbage in a day. It is being dumped at an unauthorised site in Industrial Area, Phase 8B, and nearby residents and industrialists are already protesting.In August last year, Mohali had slipped to the 157th place out of 382 cities in the nationwide Swachh Survekshan rankings. In 2019, the district’s rank was 153, while in 2018, it was 109. The main reason for Mohali’s worst slip is that the city failed to get garbage processing projects off the ground.MC commissioner Kamal Kumar Garg said, “We have only constructed the boundary wall of the plant and the state government has to take a final decision on the project,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dera-bassi-decade-on-punjab-local-bodies-department-scraps-waste-mgmt-project-101636302053391.html

The farmers had also protested on Saturday and warned the owners of the theatres not to screen the movie and they had also got assurance from the SHO regarding the same. On Sunday morning, the theatre owners started taking online bookings again for their first show at 11.30am, following which farmers reached the spot and blocked the road and got the show cancelled. The farmers alleged that the film Suryavanshi favours Prime Minister Narendra Modi and is praising his deeds. They said that Modi is against farmers and the agriculture bills will ruin the future of the farmers and Akshay Kumar has become a puppet at his hands, because of which they are opposing the screening of the film. Bhartiya Kisan Union (Sidhupur) Mohali vice-president Kirpal Singh Siau said, “Narendra Modi has planned to ruin the future of the farmers and film actors like Akshay Kumar are blindly following his footsteps. We will not allow his films to ruin in Punjab.” In August this year, the farmers had stopped the screening of Akshay starrer Bell Bottom as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/zirakpur-protesting-farmers-stop-screening-of-suryavanshi-for-2nd-day-in-a-row-101636301571371.html

Both cases were registered in 2020, but no arrests have been made. However, on Saturday, Tripura police booked 102 social media account holders under one UAPA case for posting alleged distorted news regarding communal violence in the state and also served notices to social media companies, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube to block these 102 profiles on these platforms. The move came after the state police booked four Delhi-based advocates, under the UAPA and some other charges of the Indian Penal Code, who visited the state as part of an independent fact-finding team. Of the total 102 account holders, 68 are on Twitter followed by 32 Facebook accounts and 2 on YouTube, according to the police.A senior police official said that a one-to-one correlation with the briefing of these Delhi-based lawyers and the communal propaganda on social media was observed. “We registered a master case under the UAPA and some other sections of Indian Penal Code in this regard and served notices separately to the lawyers and the 102 social media account holders,” said the official on the condition of anonymity. Reacting to the move, the Editors Guild of India demanded the Tripura government to conduct a fair investigation into the matter and also reiterated their earlier plea to the Supreme Court to take cognizance of the matter alleging unjustified use of laws against freedom of speech and to issue guidelines on charging media persons under them, to ensure that these laws don’t become an easy tool to suppress the freedom of press. “The Editors Guild of India is deeply shocked by the Tripura Police’s action of booking 102 people, including journalists, under the coercive Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, for reporting and writing on the recent communal violence in the state,” they tweeted.In a press statement released on Sunday, they said, “The Guild is of the opinion that this is an attempt by the state government to deflect attention away from its own failure to control majoritarian violence, as well as to take action against the perpetrators of this. Governments cannot use stringent laws like UAPA to suppress reporting on such incidents.”They also cited one of the journalists, Shyam Meera Singh, who alleged to have been booked under UAPA for his three-word tweet ‘Tripura is burning.”On the issue, Information and Cultural Affairs Minister Sushanta Chowdhury said, “A section of outsiders attempted to bring a particular religion throughout the country and unite them against the Narendra Modi government. Our government is very much serious about law and we will not allow any communal disturbance here. Peace and communal harmony prevail in the BJP regime.”CPM veteran leader and former deputy speaker of Assembly termed it as an interference of the government and said, “Controversial posts on social media that can ignite communal tension are not encouraged. The concerned social media platforms can alert them, but how come government asks to block social media accounts.”It started since the state witnessed the vandalism of a mosque and a few houses and shops at Panisagar sub-division of North District on October 26. Pictures and videos of the burning mosque were circulated on social media that was refuted by the police claiming that no mosque was burnt in the state and those pictures were not from Tripura.Police also denied the news of vandalism of a mosque at Kakraban in Gomati district saying that the mosque is fine and it was a misrepresentation of facts.The police earlier said that they had booked 71 persons for allegedly spreading rumours on communal violence incidents in the state on social media.The High Court also sought a report on the incident that happened at Panisagar by November 10. Later, the National Human Rights Commission also sought an action-taking report from the state regarding the violence following a complaint filed by All India Trinamool Congress national spokesperson Saket Gokhale. According to the NCRB data, from 2016 to 2020, Manipur registered 1,421 cases under the UAPA - the highest among the northeastern states. Assam was in the second spot with 820 cases followed by 36 cases in Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland each, 17 cases in Meghalaya, 2 in Tripura and only one in Mizoram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/no-arrests-in-5-years-in-2-uapa-cases-in-tripura-101636300730050.html
07-11-2021||Lucknow||Kairana exodus: UP CM to meet a group of people who have returned||Samajwadi Party (SP) has termed chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s proposed meeting with a group of people, who had left Kairana town in 2016 and later came back, during his visit to Shamli district on Monday “an attempt to communalise atmosphere in western UP ahead of 2022 assembly elections”. As per the CM’s schedule received at Shamli district headquarters, Yogi will on Monday lay the foundation stones of a PAC battalion camp and other projects in Kairana besides meeting a group of people who had left the town in 2016 and later came back. The CM will also address a public meeting in Kairana. Shamli superintendent of police Sukirti Madhav Mishra confirmed the schedule and the CM’s proposed meeting with a group of people who had left the town in 2016 but returned thereafter. However, the exact number of people meeting the CM is yet not clear. Alleging that the government did nothing for the development of Kairana, SP leader Sudhir Pawar, who belongs to Shamli district, said, “They are now playing the exodus card again to polarise voters on the basis of religion to get political mileage.” Pawar claimed that the then BJP MP Hukum Singh had raised the issue of exodus but he had later admitted that it was not associated with Hindu and Muslims.The then minister of state for home Hansraj Aheer had said in Parliament that no such issue existed in western UP, the SP leader further claimed. He said that during his recent visit to Kairana, SP president Akhilesh Yadav announced to set up a university for girls and an industrial zone there. “Instead of talking about issues of real development, they are raising an issue which never existed,” Pawar alleged.The then BJP MP Hukum Singh had in June 2016 claimed that close to 350 Hindus had left Kairana over alleged threats and extortion by criminal elements belonging to a particular community. Later, Kairan police had claimed that a spot verification of 150 addresses of the list revealed several reasons for the migration, including better business and job prospects.The then ruling Samajwadi Party had sent a delegation under Congress leader Acharya Pramod Krishnam to verify the charges. Later, the Bharatiya Janata Party had also sent a delegation of their MPs and leaders to enquire about the issue.Speaking over the phone, Congress leader Acharya Pramod Krishnam said, “People had least grievances against one other. They wanted stern action against criminals.” Krishnam also expressed his dismay that the ruling SP didn’t initiate any action on the recommendations of their report.The traders’ community of Kairana too had then claimed that reign of terror unleashed by dreaded criminal Mukim Kala and his gang was one of the major reasons for many traders shifting their base. Kala struck terror in Kairana by killing two businessmen in August 2014 after they refused to pay him extortion. Earlier, one more businessman was allegedly shot dead by members of Furkan gang in broad daylight. Later, Kala was arrested and lodged in Chitrakoot jail where he was allegedly shot dead by another inmate when a gang war broke out inside the jail in May this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/kairana-exodus-up-cm-to-meet-a-group-of-people-who-have-returned-101636300248868.html
07-11-2021||Lucknow||Helping poor farmers grow vegetables in parts of Lucknow||The Central Institute for Subtropical Horticulture (CISH) Is helping poor farmers, who lack resources, grow vegetables by providing them seedlings. “Approximately 2.5 lakh winter vegetable seedlings are being distributed to 1,000 poor farmers of Mall and Kakori blocks of Lucknow districts to help them achieve nutritional security by growing their own vegetables,” said CISH director Shailendra Rajan.He said seedlings were being made available to them in their villages so that they could grow and understand the importance of nutri gardens. “On the basis of last year’s experiences, it can be expected that these farmers would produce vegetables worth ₹30 lakh. They are selling their extra produce in rural markets which provides them with a steady source of income,” Rajan said.“In the past, nearly 30,000 broccoli seedlings were made available to farmers. These farmers are now interested in cultivating it due to its prevailing higher market price,” he added. “Because of its nutritional value and high concentration of bioactive compounds, broccoli is in high demand in Lucknow. It has also become common in villages,” Ranjan said.“Presently farmers are not getting good returns from cauliflower and cabbage production during the peak season,” Rajan added. While providing inputs like grafted plants and plantlets to farmers as part of the “Amrit Bharat Mahotsav” programme recently, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) also raised awareness about food and nutrition for farmers among them.In keeping with the theme, farmers and other participants learned about the health benefits of eating a wide variety of fruits and vegetables. His said fruits like mango, guava and others, which are sources of bioactive substances like flavonoids, polyphenolic acids and vitamins, lower the risk of diabetes, cancer and heart diseases.For farmers in poor villages, ICAR-CISH is making efforts to supply high quality planting materials for various fruit and vegetable crops as well as assist them in implementing best management practices for higher yields, better product quality, and higher profits.“Some of the most successful strategies include meetings between scientists and farmers, exposure visits, supply of critical inputs and sustained farmer encouragement with an emphasis on the youth and women,” Rajan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/helping-poor-farmers-grow-vegetables-in-parts-of-lucknow-101636299528722.html

On Saturday, the temperature was 30 degrees Celsius while the minimum temperature was 14.4 degrees Celsius.“The sharp change in temperature as recorded in the city, or for that matter in the entire northern plains, is the phenomenon which would continue for this entire month as the difference in daily temperature would keep on decreasing till the time winter fully sets in”, said AU’s head of geography department prof AR Siddiqui.Several hospitals are witnessing heavy rush and a sudden spurt in number of OPD patients mainly those suffering from viral fever, asthma or its related symptoms. “As there has been a high fluctuation in the day and night temperatures these past few days, it provides an ideal environment for the growth and spread of viruses and bacteria, which is the common cause for various ailments”, said Dr Neelam Shukla, a medico based in Dhumanganj locality.Dr Kamal Kumar, a senior local physician, said, “This lack of sunlight weakens our body’s immune system thereby making it a suitable environment for the viruses to survive in the body much longer than they can during summer”.“Most people, including children of all ages, suffer with several winter ailments like the cold, cough, congestion, flu and sore throat,” said Dr SAM Meesum, another Sangam city doctor. “The cold winter also brings with it different kinds of allergies and a problem of dry and itchy skin and people suffering from asthma may find their symptoms getting aggravated,” he added. “As the temperatures fluctuate, make sure that your kid is kept warm at night,” suggests the expert.Supplementing our food with lots of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants that are vital to boost the body defence mechanism in order to fight the viruses and bacteria, Vitamin “C” in particular, is also advisable, said Dr RP Singh, in-charge, ESI Hospital-Naini.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/cold-cough-cases-rising-in-prayagraj-due-to-weather-change-101636298328854.html

Arbaaz Merchant and Achit Kumar reached the NCB office in south Mumbai on Sunday, and the agency has been recording their statement. The SIT headed by IPS Sanjay Singh said, “We have summoned several people including accused and witnesses connected to the case and we are examining them.” Arbaaz Merchant’s father advocate Aslam Merchant said, “We received the summons on Sunday, the date of issue was mentioned Saturday, hence after getting it we came to the NCB office. We do not have any issues and we are cooperating in the investigation. Good for us that the facts will come out. As per law, the NCB can call any suspects for investigation if they are required to verify certain facts and to maintain transparency in the case.” An NCB source said, “Summons have been sent to Aryan Khan and we will record his statement in the coming days.” Aryan, Merchant and Munmun Dhamecha were detained by the NCB on October 2 after a drug raid on a cruise ship. After questioning several hours, the three were arrested on October 3. Khan and Merchant were sent to judicial custody at Arthur Road Jail on October 7, while Dhamecha was sent to Byculla Women’s Jail. They got bail from Bombay high court on October 28 and Khan was released from jail on October 30, while Merchant and Dhamecha on October 31. The SIT also visited the cruise ship to verify the facts on Saturday evening. The agency recorded the statement of CISF officials as well as staff members of the cruise ship presented during the raid on October 3. Zonal director Sameer Wankhede was with the team while visiting the cruise ship. “The captain of the cruise ship, nine independent witnesses including Prabhakar Sail as well as other people connected in the case will also be examined,” said Singh. The SIT was formed on November 5 and NCB chief SN Pradhan issued an order transferring the six cases from NCB’s Mumbai zonal unit to the operations branch from its headquarters to conduct a deeper investigation. The SIT team reached Mumbai on Saturday to take over the probe into six cases, which included the drugs-on-cruise case, in which actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan was arrested by Wankhede. Singh said SIT will take the help of Wankhede who was supervising the case earlier. The other cases also include the drugs case against Sameer Khan, son-in-law of Maharashtra cabinet minister and Nationalist Congress Party leader Nawab Malik. Khan was arrested by NCB in the first week of January 2021 and was released on bail on September 28. The SIT will also probe the case involving actor Armaan Kohli. An NCB team led by Wankhede had raided Kohli’s Juhu residence on August 28 and recovered a small quantity of cocaine. Kohli was arrested on August 29. The fourth case to be probed by the SIT was registered by the agency’s Mumbai zonal unit on July 25 when it arrested three persons – Sameer Mukhtar Sayyed alias Sam Langda, Zakir Sayyed alias Zakir Takla alias Zakir Chikna and Mohammad Amed Shamsuddin Shaikh and allegedly seized 1.2kg of charas, an intermediate quantity of mephedrone along with ₹17.5 lakh in cash from them. NCB claimed that Sameer Merchant alias Sam Langda was a notorious, organised drug mafia member. The fifth case on the list was registered in September when NCB recovered an intermediate quantity of mephedrone, whereas the sixth case related to the recovery of mephedrone from the Dongri area in south Mumbai. Pooja Dadlani summonedMumbai Police’s special investigation team (SIT) formed to inquire into the extortion allegations levelled by witness Prabhakar Sail against NCB’s zonal director Sameer Wankhede and controversial witness Kiran Gosavi, has summoned Pooja Dadlani, Shah Rukh Khan’s manager, on Monday. It is alleged that Gosavi had taken ₹50 lakh from Dadlani on October 3 to save Aryan Khan from the matter. After recording the statement of Dadlani, the SIT will try to establish the exact sequence of events and corroborate allegations made by Sail in his statement. Sail in his affidavit had claimed that he overheard Gosavi and D’Souza talking about a ₹25 crore bribe to save Aryan Khan and he also heard them talking that ₹8 crore would go to NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede. Wankhede earlier had termed all these allegations as baseless.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cruise-ship-drug-bust-case-sit-from-delhi-ncb-summon-aryan-khan-arbaaz-merchant-others-101636295451960.html
07-11-2021||Bangalore||Cong to organise 'Padayatra' for implementation of Mekedatu project in K'taka||The Congress in Karnataka on Sunday decided to organise a 'Padayatra' (march) from Mekedatu to Bengaluru, covering a distance of over 100 km, probably during the first week of December, demanding the implementation of the Mekedatu project across river Cauvery.The principal opposition party in the state also asserted that Karnataka has every right to go ahead with the project as there are no legal impediments, while accusing Tamil Nadu of 'playing politics' by unnecessarily opposing it and creating issues."During the Congress and coalition government time, we had sent our plan of action and DPR to the Centre (on Mekedatu project) and it was accepted. We can today start the work, there is no impediments from the Supreme Court, what we need is environment clearance from the Centre," Shivakumar, who had earlier held the water resources portfolio, said.Speaking to reporters after a meeting of senior party leaders here, he pointed out that state's money, land and water will be utilised for the project, and Karnataka does not require any other permission for its implementation, as he alleged that Chief Minister Basavarj Bommai seems to be under some "political pressure" and "lacks political will" to go ahead with it."Implementation of the Mekedatu project is a necessity... so agitation is inevitable to demand it. So the Congress party has decided to organise a 'padayatra' (march) from Mekedatu to Bengaluru, probably in December first week, covering a distance of over 100 km, to put pressure on the central and the state governments to implement it," he said adding that exact date and route map will be decided and made known.Mekedatu is a multipurpose (drinking and power) project, which involves building a balancing reservoir, near Kanakapura in Ramanagara district of Karnataka.The project once completed is aimed at ensuring drinking water to Bengaluru and neighboring areas (4.75 TMC) and also can generate 400 MW power, and the estimated cost of the project is ₹9,000 crore.Claiming that the implementation of the Mekedatu project will in no way affect Tamil Nadu and the state was unnecessarily creating issues, Leader of Opposition Siddaramaiah said as a matter of fact, the balancing reservoir will benefit both states, and will help in releasing the water stored, during the distress year.Further accusing Tamil Nadu of 'creating issues' with regards to the project for the sake of politics, he said, "the project will be taken up within Karnataka's territory and has nothing to do with Tamil Nadu, and their (TN) right is on the quantum of water mentioned in the tribunal order." Karnataka has all the rights to implement the project, as it is to store and utilise excess water going into the sea, which will be shared with Tamil Nadu during distress times. The former CM said, "the central government should immediately grant environmental clearance. There is no impediment at all to take up the project and the state government should immediately take it up." In response to a question, he also made it clear that the 'Padayatre' organised by Congress has nothing to do with politics or upcoming 2023 assembly polls.Earlier, Karnataka Chief Minister Basvaraj Bommai had asserted that there is no "compromise" on the Mekedatu project and the state government will go ahead with its implementation, once it gets necessary approvals from the centre.He had also accused the neighbouring state of opposing it for the sake of politics.Giving further details on the meeting with Congress leader, Shivakumar said that a membership drive will be launched in Karnataka from November 14, during which, existing members will have to renew their membership and those seeking new membership should fill a form after paying ₹5.Also those wanting to become active members with voting rights, can take it by following prescribed fees and procedures.The KPCC chief said, the party also plans to organise a public awareness campaign regarding the economic situation in the country and the state, distress faced by several sections of the society, at all panchayat and assembly constituency level, as per the directions of the party's central leadership.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/cong-to-organise-padayatra-for-implementation-of-mekedatu-project-in-ktaka-101636294670186.html

They were seen raising religious slogans and appealed to the district administration to take action against anyone offering prayers in the open.Speaking to reporters in Ambala on Sunday, Anil Vij said, “Everyone has their religious events. They should be held in their respective places of worship." Vij added that such events should not take place on the streets without the permission of the administration.The Haryana home minister's remarks came two days after members of Hindu groups organised a Govardhan Puja in sector 12 on Friday, where Muslims used to offer Namaz every week.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Kapil Mishra, who was a part of Friday's Puja, objected to anyone occupying a public place to offer prayers."If people from different religions, faiths and sects keep occupying open public spaces on one day every week, it will result in blockade of all the roads and parks," Mishra was quoted as saying by news agency PTI. He added that blocking roads is not part of any religion and people have the first right to roads.In 2018, thirty-seven sites in Gurgram were designated by the administration to offer Friday Namaz, leading to protests from Hindu groups. Few months back, a group started protesting against offering of prayers in the open, following which there have been demonstrations since October, according to PTI.The Muslim community, said on Friday that it has decided to not offer prayers at the sector-12 site due to objections raised by the residents along with the recent protests held, Hindustan Times reported. To resolve the problem, a delegation of the Muslim community said that it has agreed to take up spaces on rent and urged for help from the district authorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/namaz-row-religious-events-should-be-held-inside-places-of-worship-says-vij-101636290090660.html
07-11-2021||Mumbai||Central agencies and prisons in the country have been privatised: Shiv Sena||In the backdrop of the recent arrest of former state home minister Anil Deshmukh and the action by the central agencies against leaders from the ruling parties in Maharashtra, the Shiv Sena has taken potshots at the Central government and stated that the central agencies and prisons in the country have been “privatised” as the opponents are being imprisoned on “trumped up charges”.Shiv Sena Member of Parliament (MP) Sanjay Raut, in his weekly column ‘Rokthok’ in party mouthpiece Saamana, taunted the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and stated that everyday, instead of taking up some major issues that the nation is facing, it just talks of putting its opponents in prison. He said that the central agencies are being “effectively misused” to hassle the opponents. Raut assailed that BJP was displaying a “sick mentality” as it stood behind the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) which arrested actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan and his friends despite the fact that he did not possess any drugs. It also accused BJP of supporting the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for arresting Deshmukh without any concrete proof. “The [Narendra] Modi government is anyway on a privatisation spree and the way central agencies such as ED, NCB and CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation) are working, it appears that even they have now been privatised. BJP claims everyday that it will send its opponents to prison. This raises the question on whether even prisons have become privatised? We have to bear [this] till 2024, as our country seems to be becoming like a prison,” he added. Raut said that it looks like the central agencies, particularly NCB, is all set to destabilise the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) by putting the opponents in dock and cobbling up a majority for BJP.He has called Deshmukh’s arrest by ED as illegal. “A person who is accused of extortion, murder and corruption [former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh] levelled baseless charges against Deshmukh. Despite Singh claiming that he has no proof against Deshmukh, ED still arrested the leader, solely owing to BJP’s pressure,” said Raut.Raut also said that despite the reduction in the excise duty on fuel, their prices continue to remain high, above ₹100 per litre. The Central government had last week announced reduction of excise duty on auto fuel, which was expected to bring down the prices that have now breached the ₹100-mark. However, Raut claimed that the prices were slashed after the drubbing BJP received in the recent bypolls. “BJP has been praising Modi for cutting the duty on auto fuel but the fact remains that the prices are still high and are not coming below ₹100 per litre. It is good that Modi spent the first day of Diwali with the soldiers at the border. But he should have spent the second day with the poor, who are in a sorry state owing to the price rise, and understand their difficulties on how they are coping up,” said Raut.Responding to Raut’s allegations, BJP said the Shiv Sena’s only job was to target BJP instead of governing Maharashtra. “The Central government has cut the excise duty on fuel, but the state has not cut its value added tax (VAT), which many BJP-ruled states did. This would have given relief to the citizens but the state government did not do so,” said BJP legislator Ram Kadam. He also justified Deshmukh’s arrest. “The Shiv Sena has not studied Deshmukh’s case, as he is accused for money laundering. Singh’s allegations are just one aspect, as the former minister formed web of companies to launder money, and he has been arrested for that crime,” defended Kadam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/central-agencies-and-prisons-in-the-country-have-been-privatised-shiv-sena-101636292267813.html
07-11-2021||Mumbai||Sameer Wankhede’s father files ₹1.25 crore defamation suit against Nawab Malik||The Bombay high court (HC) permitted Dnyandev Wankhede, father of Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) zonal director Sameer Wankhede, to file a ₹1.25 crore defamation suit against Maharashtra minister and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Nawab Malik for posting what he termed as “derogatory comments on social media against my son and family.” On Friday, Wankhede’s lawyers Arshad Shaikh, Ranjit Agase, Krishnan Iyer and Saurabh Tamhankar informed the vacation bench of justice SJ Kathawalla that their client needed an urgent hearing on the issue and sought permission for the suit to be filed. The court permitted it and posted hearing to Monday, November 8. Apart from seeking damages of ₹1.25 crore, the suit also seeks deletion of articles and interviews on electronic and digital platforms by Malik, his party members and aides. The suit has also sought a permanent injunction against them from posting any comments through social media and messaging platforms as well as a temporary injunction against issuing statements and press releases containing any defamatory content against the Wankhede family. In response, Malik said (Sameer) Wankhede or his relatives “have the right to move court against me.” He said, “I will face it in court. (Sameer) Wankhede had moved court for a gag order against me earlier, too, but did not succeed. He claimed that he demanded an SIT (Special Investigation Team) in the case, but fact is that he demanded a probe by CBI or NIA. Wankhede has been misguiding people, but truth will prevail.” The suit states that Malik’s comments, statements and allegations levelled against Sameer Wankhede and his family was prompted by the fact that his son-in-law Sameer Khan was arrested by the NCB in January 2021 for allegedly trading in contraband material. Dnyandev’s suit claims that oral or written interviews and statements by Malik and his family members are tortious (wrongful or bringing harm to someone) and defamatory, and that the defendants have “caused irreparable loss, damage, harm, prejudice to the name, character, reputation and societal image of plaintiff and his family members.” While justifying the need for the suit, Dnyandev’s lawyers stressed that Malik had been questioning the religious beliefs of the Wankhedes, though they were Hindus, and by calling them frauds, Malik was maligning the family’s image. This insinuation by Malik, the suit says, was also affecting the legal practice of his daughter Yasmeen who takes up criminal cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sameer-wankhede-s-father-files-1-25-crore-defamation-suit-against-nawab-malik-101636291727641.html

07-11-2021||Kolkata||'Not voluntarily leaving BJP, will be party’s conscience-keeper’, says Tathagata Roy||Amid the ongoing feud with the Bharatiya Janata Party’s national vice-president Dilip Ghosh, former Meghalaya governor and party leader Tathagata Roy on Sunday confirmed that he was not mulling quitting the party voluntarily. He intends to remain as the party’s “conscience-keeper” and said he would have revealed many more “secrets” if he was quitting the party, in what appeared to be a tongue-in-cheek remark.Taking to Twitter, Roy said, “I have been deluged with phone calls since yesterday. Let me assure you that I am not leaving the party voluntarily. I am currently an ordinary member. In this situation, I will continue to play the role of the conscience-keeper of the party. If I were to leave the party, I would have leaked all the secrets, but it is not happening now,” he further said in a tweet in Bengali.গতকাল থেকে ফোনে ফোনে জর্জরিত হয়ে গেলাম। সকলকে আশ্বস্ত করছি এই বলে, যে আমি স্বেচ্ছায় দল ছাড়ছি না। আমি আপাতত এখন সাধারণ সদস্য। এই অবস্থাতেই যাত্রার বিবেকের ভূমিকা পালন করে যাব। দল ছাড়তে পারলে সব গুপ্তকথাই ফাঁস করতে পারতাম কিন্তু এখনই তা হচ্ছে না।The feud between Roy and Bengal BJP’s leadership goes back to the recently concluded state assembly elections in May 2021, in which the party had bitterly lost a high-stakes battle to chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress. Roy had particularly criticised, and often in public forums such as Twitter, the leadership of Kailash Vijayvargiya, Dilip Ghosh, Arvind Menon and Shiv Prakash, BJP’s senior leaders in the state.Notably, last month, Roy had said he was “ashamed of some top-level leaders like Vijayvargiya as, ahead of the Bengal assembly polls, they were swayed by the glamour factor while inducting people into the BJP and did not take experience and chances of winning into consideration,” according to a report by news agency PTI.Also read | ‘Why is he not quitting party?’ Dilip Ghosh’s jibe at Tathagata RoyThe comments came a day after Ghosh had responded to Roy’s frequent criticisms about the BJP’s Bengal unit’s leadership and wondered why he had not quit the party if he was so upset. “If you are so upset and ashamed of all that is happening within the party, why don't you just leave?” PTI quoted Ghosh as saying earlier on Saturday. “You (Tathagata) did nothing for the party in recent times. But the party did everything for people like you,” he further said.Meanwhile, current Bengal BJP chief Sukanta Majumder had stayed away from the altercation. On Saturday, when asked about the issue, he had refrained from commenting and only remarked that it was the “prerogative of the central leadership,” to act on Roy’s comments. Majumder was made president of the party’s state unit after Ghosh was elevated to the national role.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/not-voluntarily-leaving-bjp-will-be-party-s-conscience-keeper-says-tathagata-roy-101636289685683.html
07-11-2021||Jaipur||Rajasthan BJP demands reduction in VAT on petrol, diesel||Chief minister Ashok Gehlot-led Congress government in Rajasthan is facing pressure from all corners to reduce value-added tax (VAT) from petrol and diesel. Despite the reduction in excise duty by the Central government, Rajasthan still is on top when it comes to the rate of petrol and diesel. In Jaipur, the price of per litre petrol is ₹111.10 and that of diesel is ₹95.71. The state government has been suggesting the Centre reduces excise duty on fuel due to which the VAT collection of the states will automatically reduce. The Centre on Wednesday slashed the excise duties on petrol and diesel by ₹5 and ₹10 per litre respectively. “The reduction of excise duty on diesel-petrol by the Narendra Modi government has brought relief to the common man and traders but what Ashok Gehlot is saying is surprising that he has included VAT in the excise duty which is cheating with the public,” said Satish Poonia, state BJP chief. Poonia demanded to reduce VAT on diesel and petrol to provide relief to people. Rajasthan has levied the highest VAT on fuel in the country. Supporting the demand of the opposition, the petrol pump dealers too are asking the state government to lower the VAT at par with other neighbouring states. President, Rajasthan Petrol Pump and Dealer association, Sunnet Bagai, said, during the previous (BJP) government, the VAT on diesel was 16% and 26% on petrol, which, in the last two years, has been increased to 26% and 36% respectively. “The VAT percentage does not reduce with slashing of excise duty. Rajasthan government should reduce the VAT on diesel to 16% and 26% on petrol – at par with the neighbouring states. We are paying the highest price of petro-diesel in the country,” he said. “The dealers and public are demanding a reduction in VAT as we are losing our revenue,” Bagai said. Amid a demand to reduce VAT, chief minister Ashok Gehlot has suggested the centre to further reduce excise duty on fuel due to which the VAT collection of the states will automatically reduce. “We have been continuously urging the central government to control and reduce the prices of petrol/diesel. Now, with the centre’s decision on November 4 to reduce the excise duty, the state’s VAT has also automatically been reduced by ₹1.8 per litre on petrol and ₹2.6 per litre on diesel which has caused an annual loss of ₹1,800 crore in revenue collection of the state,” said Gehlot. He urged the GoI to restrict the oil companies from curbing the daily increase in the prices of petrol/diesel prices. else after Diwali or assembly elections of five states, the oil companies will increase the price and make the benefit of the relief given by the central and state government to zero. Gehlot said that the central government has already reduced the share that all the state governments used to get from excise duty. He added, due to the situation of Covid-19, there has been a huge decline in the revenue of the states. “About ₹5,963 crores of GST compensation of Rajasthan is yet to be paid by the central government,” he said. He said that the state governments levy VAT on the revenue collected by the central government in the form of additional excise duty, special excise duty, and CESS from petrol, diesel, and gas. “In view of inflation, the central government should make further reduction due to which the VAT collection of the states will automatically reduce in the same proportion,” he suggested. As with the announcement of reducing the price of petrol by ₹5 and diesel by ₹10, the revenue of the state of Rajasthan will be reduced by ₹1800 crore. During this year’s budget, due to the reduction of VAT by 2% by the state government, there has been a revenue loss of ₹1000 crores - thus the total revenue of ₹2800 crore will reduce, said Gehlot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-bjp-demands-reduction-in-vat-on-petrol-diesel-101636289268713.html

We could track it over our 4G network with our tracker," he noted.HPCL wants Omnipresent to extend the range of Omni Hansa V5 to 100-200 km, he said.Omni Hansa V5 can take off and land like a helicopter so it does not need a runway. However, once it is in air, it flies like a plane, Sinha stated.This drone is called hybrid fixed-wing VTOL (vertical take off and landing) drone, he explained."We successfully completed India's longest drone flight. We flew the drone for 51 km for one of our pipeline clients HPCL. It was a BVLOS (beyond visual line of sight) flight. This is a record in India," he claimed.He said the flight took place to survey the pipeline of HPCL that runs between Delhi and Haryana. "It (pipeline) starts from Bahadurgarh (in Haryana)," he added.Officials of HPCL were also present during the flight demonstration, he stated.The flight went up to the height of maximum 400 feet, as permitted by the rules of aviation regulator DGCA. Sinha said Omnipresent has registered 100 per cent growth in last one year and it is expected to grow three to five times in the next 3-4 years.The company aims to reach the target of ₹1,000 crore revenue in the next four years, he added. Currently, the company is also working with Indian e-commerce giants that want to deploy drones for delivering items.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/indias-longest-drone-flight-conducted-in-haryana-for-hpcl-claims-robotics-firm-101636287161593.html

07-11-2021||Mumbai||Money laundering case: Bombay high court stays PMLA court order, grants ED custody of Anil Deshmukh||The vacation bench of the Bombay high court (HC) on Sunday granted custody of former Maharashtra home minister and Nationalist Congress Party leader Anil Deshmukh to Enforcement Directorate (ED) till November 12. The ED moved the HC on Saturday night after the special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court refused to grant additional custody of Deshmukh to ED in the money laundering case and sent him to 14-day judicial custody on Saturday. Appearing for ED, additional solicitor general Anil Singh and advocate Shreeram Shirsat told the single judge bench of justice Madhav Jamdar that the special court had not heeded their plea for extension of custody for nine days. Singh argued that the money laundering investigation was at a crucial stage. By not granting extension of Deshmukh’s custody, the investigation could be hampered, they said. Appearing for Deshmukh senior advocate Vikram Chaudhri and advocate Aniket Nikam said that though there was much to say and argue on the merit as well as the maintainability of the application, they were voluntarily agreeing to ED custody, and hence, by consent, not opposing the ED’s application. They said Deshmukh had been cooperating with the investigation since the day he had visited the ED office on November 2 morning – and arrested 12 hours later – and will continue to do so. After hearing the submissions by ED, the court referred to a Gujarat HC order wherein a revision application was allowed on the grounds that, “An order refusing to grant remand has direct bearing on the proceedings of the trial itself and in a given case will definitely have effect on the ultimate decision of the case.” Justice Jamdar observed, “I have gone through the impugned order and also relevant investigation papers. Prima facie there is substance in the contentions raised by Mr. Anil Singh and also contentions raised in criminal revision application about the legality of the impugned order.” Thereafter, justice Jamdar granted custody of Deshmukh to ED till November 12. Deshmukh had been arrested by ED on the midnight of November 2 and 3, in connection with the investigation in the FIR filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on April 21 this year, based on an allegation of former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh. Deshmukh was accused by Singh of having directed police officers to collect ₹100 crore from bars and restaurants every month. The ED claimed that Deshmukh had received ₹4.7 crore from dismissed police officer Sachin Vaze which he had allegedly collected from various bars and restaurants. The agency has further claimed that Deshmukh laundered the amount through a shell company based in Delhi and had received the amount in Shree Sai Shikshan Sanstha, a trust owned by his family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/money-laundering-case-bombay-high-court-stays-pmla-court-order-grants-ed-custody-of-anil-deshmukh-101636287167306.html
07-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi environment minister urges Centre to hold emergency meeting with neighbouring states on stubble burning||Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai said on Sunday that the Centre should hold an “emergency” meeting with the states bordering the national capital to address the issue of crop residue burning. Rai also claimed that burning of crop residue in the states of Haryana, Punjab, and Uttar Pradesh is behind Delhi’s worsening air quality."There was also the effect of cracker bursting on Diwali but it's waning now. The effect of ‘parali’ burning, however, continues to worsen air quality in Delhi," the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) legislator told reporters during a press conference.The overall air quality in the national capital remained in the ‘severe’ category, two days after Diwali, as the air quality index (AQI) stood at an alarming 436 on Sunday morning. Data from System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR) shows that farm fires or crop residue burning contributed 25% of PM 2.5 on Diwali, the highest concentration since October 20.Even though state governments of Haryana and Punjab introduced new strategies to combat farm fires, data collected by Hindustan Times showed the neighbouring state of Punjab witnessed 3,032 incidents of farm fires on Diwali. At around 228, Haryana too witnessed a surge in farm fires on Diwali.A delayed harvesting season as well as lack of sufficient incentives to encourage farmers to keep them from burning crop residue contributed to this spike.Bursting of firecrackers on Diwali had also contributed to the national capital’s deteriorating air quality. Despite a government ban on the use, sale, and storage of crackers citizens openly flouted the rules after procuring firecrackers from the neighbouring states of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.The AAP government hit out at Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for encouraging people to burn crackers and for giving the issue of cracker ban a “religious colour”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-environment-minister-urges-centre-to-hold-emergency-meeting-with-neighbouring-states-on-stubble-burning-101636286428859.html

"...Very soon you will seek elevation as a judge so that you can decide this case. Being the highest law officer, your focus is on politics and political gains," he said.Sidhu's diatribe came a day after Deol accused Navjot Singh Sidhu of obstructing the functioning of the state government and his office, and "spreading misinformation to gain political advantage". Sidhu on Sunday alleged that the advocate general's "earnest inaction" was subverting justice in the sacrilege and drug cases.In a series of tweets on Sunday, Sidhu slammed Deol, saying "justice is blind but the people of Punjab are not"."Mr. AG-PUNJAB, Justice is blind but people of Punjab are not.

Deol had represented former Punjab DGP Sumedh Singh Saini and inspector general Paramraj Singh Umaranangal in relation to cases regarding incidents of sacrilege and subsequent police firing in Kotkapura and Behbal Kalan in 2015, according to news agency PTI.A senior advocate of the Punjab and Haryana high court, Deol was appointed to the post in September after Atul Nanda resigned as the advocate general following the exit of Captian Amarinder Singh as the Punjab chief minister."A person of character does the right thing for right reason with right motive. Your earnest inaction is clearly subverting justice rather than ensuring it," Sidhu alleged.A person of character does the right thing for right reason with right motive. Your earnest inaction is clearly subverting justice rather than ensuring it. 12/12In another tweet, Sidhu alleged that Deol had prayed for transferring the investigation to the CBI as "you were afraid of their false implication in sacrilege cases on accounts of malafide, malice and ulterior motives on the part of political party in power in the state of Punjab"."May I know which interest (vested or otherwise) were you acting for when you appeared for the main conspirators and procured blanket bail for them and which interest, you are acting now," he asked.A month after announcing his resignation as the state Congress chief, Sidhu withdrew it on Friday. However, he said he would re-assume charge only after the state government replaced the advocate general."Are you acting at the behest of those who appointed you in this constitutional office and fulfilling their political gains," Sidhu said on Sunday, targeting Deol, who is considered chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi's choice for the post of the AG, news agency PTI reported."Did you advise the government to challenge the blanket bail order procured by you or any other adverse order in sacrilege cases in Supreme Court," he asked.You appeared for the accused, now representing the State and very soon you will seek elevation as a judge so that you can decide this case.

Hon'ble High Court itself gave a copy of the STF report to our Government for consideration and you are shielding the inaction of the Government under the guise of your own unknown Ethics," Sidhu said."I believe that Ethics is about the way things ought to be, not about the way things are.

Veteran TMC MP Sougata Roy told reporters that he would soon write to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, seeking an extension of the scheme. "Poor people of this country, still reeling under the devastating impact of the pandemic, will be hit hard if the scheme is discontinued," he pointed out.The Centre had on Friday said that there was no proposal at present to continue PMGKAY, given the recovery in the economy and good disposal of foodgrain under the Open Market Sale Scheme (OMSS). Roy further said that the state government will continue to provide ration to people free of cost. "Those grappling with economic crisis in the midst of the rising fuel prices will need assistance from the state as well as the Centre. If the Union government discontinues the scheme, it will add to their woes," the TMC MP stated. He hoped the central government will reconsider its plans. "I will be writing to PM Narendra Modi soon to request him to continue the scheme for another six months," the Dumdum MP said on the sidelines of a function here. At another event in the city, Left Front Chairman and veteran CPI(M) leader Biman Bose also put forth the same demand. "We know that this country has enough foodgrain for distribution among the poor. And running the scheme for an extended period of time should not be a problem," Bose added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/tmc-urges-centre-to-extend-free-ration-scheme-for-6-more-months-101636284103272.html

07-11-2021||Chandigarh||Ariel’s love’s labour lost: Learnings of a pet mother||When Ariel, our six-year-old beagle, conceived after a number of pseudo-pregnancies, a current of joy spread among family and friends. The household was abuzz with her dietary needs, exercise regimen, sleep patterns, changing gait and what not. Each of us would wager on the possible number of puppies after giving her the belly rubs she so demanded. The 60-day countdown was happily endured in the hope of a mewling litter of cuddly beagles. The whelping started with her painful contractions, panting and vomiting. When the first pup arrived at dawn, we watched with pride as little Ariel, schooled in the ‘ivy league’ of nature, deftly tore open the amniotic sac, licked the pup clean and bit off the umbilical cord with surgical precision. She delivered five in quick succession. When the sixth arrived, we knew something was amiss. She knew instantly that the pup was stillborn and rushed out of the kennel, holding the baby in her mouth. She dug a pit and began covering the carcass with her nose, only to leave the process midway to handle the seventh arrival, another stillborn. Her misery did not stop her from laying her dead ones to rest with complete dignity. Images of man-made miseries from the second Covid-19 wave narrated a contrasting human tale. Finally, anxiety did get the better of her. The contractions stopped and in spite of a well-formed udder, she could not lactate. As her temperature rose and condition worsened, veterinary intervention was sought. The ultrasound revealed two undelivered pups. Artificial labour was induced but to no avail. An emergency C-Section was performed to clear the uterus and Ariel got back home to the surviving pups. Regardless of utter distress, she agitatedly began licking her babies the moment she regained consciousness. The unfolding of the next four days, blew away the Descartian concept of human superiority in emotional intelligence. Ariel was crazed by the realisation that she was unable to feed the newborns. In agitation, she substituted licking for suckling. She huddled them under her chest, constantly cleaning and feeling them. Breaking her defence to bottle feed the pups was an uphill task. She raptly overlooked the process, giving minimal time for nursing. Sniffing and inspecting every drop of medicine given to the pups, not for a moment did she lower the guard. Separating the pups from her for incubation was another challenge. In spite of best efforts, the puppies started fading away. When the third, nicknamed Tilak, passed away in the cardboard incubating box, she intuitively knew it. She pounded the box, grabbed him and lay next to him moaning. The entire household sighed in revelation. The death of the last two survivors, called ‘Boy’ and ‘Girl’, of hypothermia devastated Ariel. She was restlessly in and out of the house, digging carpets or the ground. When she lay down, visceral agony translated into deep groans. Often as she snuggles close to us for security, her moist nose and watery eyes reveal the mysteries of the non-human universe. Within a week, a playful pet changed into a heartbroken parent. Her palpable expression of loss set me thinking. Are we right in underrating the feelings of the animal world? manindersidhu7@gmail.com The writer is professor of English at Government College for Girls in Chandigarh||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ariels-love-s-labour-lost-learnings-of-a-pet-mother-101636279846258.html

Addressing a press conference on Sunday, Rai cited official data from November 1 till November 6, which revealed that whenever stubble burning increased in neighbouring states such as Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, the level of pollution also went up in Delhi.“The data showed that pollution levels in Delhi are seeing an alarming rise because of stubble burning, and bursting of firecrackers during Diwali made the situation worse,” Rai said.He pointed out that the impact of firecrackers is reducing in the national capital but the effect of stubble burning is on a constant level. “The threat of pollution will loom till there is no solution for stubble burning,” Rai added.The environment minister's remarks came after the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR) said that stubble burning accounted for 36% of the pollution in Delhi, Hindustan Times reported on Saturday.During Sunday's press conference, environment minister Rai also said that the impact of the Delhi government's anti-pollution initiatives such as the anti-dust campaign, the 'Red Light on, Gaadi off' campaign and electric vehicles among others was failing because of stubble burning.Rai requested that the Centre must hold an emergency meeting of the environment ministers of Delhi, Haryana, Punjab Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan on stubble burning.Also Watch| Delhi Pollution: Not just about firecrackers, stubble burns. Netas ignoring lasting solutions? Highlighting that there has been no stubble burning in Delhi, Rai told reporters that the national capital is facing the impact due to fire being set to straw stubble in neighbouring states.On Sunday, the air quality index (AQI) in Delhi continued to remain in the ‘severe category’ at 436, according to data shared by SAFAR. However, the data also showed that the AQI is likely to improve to the upper end of the 'very poor' category as the "surface winds are becoming stronger", dispersing air pollutants from Sunday evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-will-again-suffocate-if-stubble-burning-doesn-t-reduce-gopal-rai-101636275542716.html

But this government has done nothing so far,” former chief minister and SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal said, according to a PTI report. He earlier on Saturday demanded that the government reduce prices by ₹10.The BJP earlier this week attacked state governments ruled by the opposition parties like the Congress and the Trinamool Congress for not reducing the VAT on petrol and diesel soon after the announcement was made by the Centre.

This year in September, we were in a hotel room where Sunil Patil told Bhanushali that a big game has happened.” Vijay Pagare was quoted as telling ANI in an interview.Elaborating further, Pagare claimed that Bhanushali met him on October 3 and asked him to accompany the BJP worker to get money. “While I was with him in the car, I heard them saying that a deal of ₹25 crore was scheduled but settled on ₹18 crore and ₹50 lakhs taken,” Pagare claimed in his interview.ALSO READ | 'Sameer Dawood Wankhede's private army': Nawab Malik reacts to BJP's 'twist' given to Aryan Khan case“After this, we reached the NCB office where I saw the whole atmosphere.

Following the raid, Aryan Khan was arrested on October 3, along with his friend Arbaaz Seth Merchant and model Munmum Dhamecha, and was sent to judicial custody on October 7. After a high-profile legal battle fought by former Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi and celebrated lawyer Satish Maneshinde, Aryan Khan got bail in the case from Bombay high court on October 28. Meanwhile, another key witness in the Mumbai cruise ship drugs raid case, Prabhakar Sail, gave a twist to the high-profile case by claiming that he heard private investigator KP Gosavi speak about a pay-off of ₹8 crore to Sameer Wankhede. The top NCB officer, however, denied the allegations and sought protection from any legal action. Sail was hired as a personal bodyguard by private Gosavi, who also accompanied the NCB officials to the raid.

07-11-2021||Chandigarh||Srinagar: Residents fume over J&K admn’s move to station CRPF men at community halls||The Jammu and Kashmir administration’s decision to station additional CRPF personnel in community or marriage halls of Srinagar has triggered resentment from locals and political leaders of the UT.The residents have expressed their opposition after at least two major community halls were occupied by CRPF in the past few days. They have demanded an alternative accommodation for the security personnel. “A few days back, some cops came to see if they could accommodate CRPF men in our local community hall. This is an absurd decision whosoever had taken it. People organise all their important functions in these halls. They are indispensable to the community life in the city,” said a resident of Nowpora, not wishing to identify his name. A resident of Khanyar said these halls are amid the congested localities and any militant activity and the response from the forces would be deadly for the surrounding locals. “We fear the consequences,” he said. Srinagar has 24 community/marriage halls managed by its municipal corporation, many of which are in the Old City area. Even government campaigns like vaccination drives, Aadhaar enrolments, and relief distributions are held at these centres.These halls have now been assigned to CRPF by the administration with the help of local police. CRPF spokesperson Abiram Pankaj said they have no say in where their additional troops would be accommodated. “CRPF’s accommodation is arranged by civil administration. These places have been assigned by the police to us and we have no choice. It is their prerogative. We only see whether the basic facilities are alright,” he added. “Now we have come to know that people are facing some issues. It is up to the city SSP,” he said. However, calls and messages to Kashmir divisional commissioner Pandurang K Pole and Srinagar SSP Sandeep Choudhary did not elicit any response.The CRPF spokesperson said, “The security scenario here changed after October 1. That is why more troops have been brought in from north and south Kashmir.”Srinagar MC commissioner Athar Aamir Khan refused to comment on the issue. “This is a very sensitive issue and I cannot comment on this,” he said. Meanwhile, PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti said, “After placing security bunkers at every nook and corner of Srinagar, CRPF personnel have been pushed into marriage halls which is the only private space left for people here. Every day, more draconian laws are brought in with the sole purpose of suffocating people into silence.”Srinagar mayor Junaid Mattu, in a tweet on Friday, said the MC wasn’t consulted on this decision and added that he has spoken to divisional commissioner for other options.NC vice-president and former J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah said, “My government built community/marriage halls and demolished bunkers in Srinagar. It’s disappointing to see the security situation in the city has now regressed so much that new bunkers are being constructed and marriage halls are being used as barracks for security forces.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/srinagar-residents-fume-over-j-k-admn-s-move-to-station-crpf-men-at-community-halls-101636252422095.html

This has hugely impacted students, who are not able to attend their online classes as the internet remains shut down during day hours.” The former four-time legislator in a statement said due to this unannounced ban businessmen, doctors, media personnel and other professionals are also suffering immensely. “The 2019 communication blockade led to huge economic losses and unemployment. The latest curbs on the internet are bound to aggravate the situation. The curbs on 4G internet in Kashmir are contrary to government claims of creating opportunities for all citizens by harnessing digital technologies through the Digital India initiative,” he said, adding that it’s high time that internet services are restored throughout Kashmir without any further delay. People will punish arrogant BJP govt: MirJ&K Pradesh Congress Committee chief GA Mir said “people of Jammu and Kashmir will punish the arrogant BJP government at the Centre as reflected in the recent byelections in the country which resulted into immediate reduction of huge taxes on petrol and diesel”.Lauding the people of Himachal and other states for “showing the mirror to the arrogant Modi government”, Mir said people will “punish the BJP in Jammu and Kashmir and elsewhere in the country in the coming elections”.Addressing a meeting of senior Congress leaders as part of the 50th year celebrations of the 1971 war, he briefed the functionaries, party’s district presidents, frontal wings and corporators about the series of functions to be held from Sunday till December 16 to commemorate the Vijay Diwas. He said a commemoration committee headed by former defence minister AK Antony as chairperson and Praveen Davar as national coordinator is holding series of yearlong programmes in the country to celebrate the country’s victory.A function will be addressed by Davar on Sunday at JK Plaza and another at Ploura Jammu rural on Monday.The meeting was also briefed about the nationwide ‘Jan Jagran Abhiyan’ from November 14 to 29 besides membership drive which will be inaugurated in Jammu and Kashmir by AICC incharge, J&K affairs, Rajni Patil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/tarigami-internet-shutdown-bringing-back-painful-memories-of-2019-101636251702071.html
07-11-2021||Chandigarh||Stringent curbs may return to Srinagar as Covid pockets emerge||Stringent restrictions may return to parts of Srinagar if the spurt in Covid cases in some pockets of the city is not contained, Srinagar deputy commissioner Mohammad Aijaz Asad said on Saturday. A day after eight more containment zones were added in the city, Asad, along with other administrative and health officials, visited various parts of Srinagar and conducted flash Covid tests of people not following the pandemic-related protocols.Asad said that he would not like to see Srinagar becoming the cause of the third Covid wave in the Valley. “The Covid cases are increasing. There are certain places like Lal Bazaar where we have seen 18 cases in the past one week, 12 cases in Chanapora, 15 in Bemina and other pockets from where the infections are getting reported constantly,” Asad told the media during his tour. He said that so far, the region has been saved from the third coronavirus wave. “I would not want an invitation to be given to the third wave. The limits on social functions and marriages should not be violated and I want to appeal to all to wear masks and avoid public places,” he said. Of the 1,009 active coronavirus cases in Jammu and Kashmir till November 5, more than half are in Srinagar. This is the only district which is reporting 40 to 60 cases daily, around half of the 100-odd infections in the entire union territory.Asad said that some three-four pockets of the city are under scanner from where cases are constantly rising.“If there is no decline in cases from those pockets then we will have to impose more restrictions in a localised manner,” he said.There are 82 containment zones in Srinagar, eight of which were added on Friday.“Eight micro containment zones were declared yesterday and if cases are not controlled in these micro containment zones, then we will have to impose further restrictions,” he said.On the criticism from people that the government itself was organising big gatherings and not following Covid-19 protocols in the city, the DC said that they were doing everything for the people. “Government works for people and if we are on the road, some 10-15 people will be with me. There is no alternative to this. We are trying to control Covid. Wherever we think we need to take action, we do that,” he added.“There may be some events which are held for the public which are necessary and the Covid protocols are kept in mind in those functions,” the DC said.Although Jammu and Kashmir recorded its lowest Covid count in eight months in October, the union territory has been witnessing a slow and consistent rise in active cases over the past two weeks — majority of which is contributed by Srinagar.The active cases in J&K had been on the decline, reaching its lowest ebb on October 20 with 800 cases. However after October 20, the active cases slowly went up and reached 1,009 on November 5, an increase of 26% in 16 days.J&K reports highest daily Covid cases in 45 daysJammu and Kashmir reported 151 Covid cases on Saturday, highest daily total in 45 days.Of the total cases, 135 were reported in Kashmir valley with Srinagar, which is witnessing a spurt in cases, being responsible for 79 infections. The Jammu division saw 16 infections. On September 23, the UT had recorded 172 cases.The number of patients who were cured in the UT was 69 with active positive cases reaching 1,091. Officials said with 79 cases, Srinagar had the highest number of new infections followed by 14 cases in Baramulla and 12 cases in Budgam, with no or single-digit cases in the other 16 districts. Srinagar has the highest number of active cases at 554 followed by Baramulla and Budgam districts with 160 and 85 such cases, respectively. The government’s daily health bulletin also said that 81,729 vaccines were administered, taking the number of overall doses administered in the UT to 1.51 crore.The overall number of people who have recovered reached 3,27,380, prompting the recovery rate to climb up to 98.35%. Since the pandemic started, the total cases in J&K have reached 3,32,911 and the death toll stood at 4,440.The officials said that 41,649 tests were conducted in the past 24 hours in the UT.The Jammu district has the highest number of 1,146 fatalities followed by Srinagar with 851 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/stringent-curbs-may-return-to-srinagar-as-covid-pockets-emerge-101636251401924.html
07-11-2021||Chandigarh||Mutilated body of 5-year-old boy found in Shimla, leopard attack suspected||Himachal Pradesh Police’s two days of frantic search on Saturday led to the recovery of the mutilated body of a five-year-old boy, who had gone missing from his house in Shimla’s Down Dale locality adjoining the forest. The police had found the pair of trousers of Yograj about 100 metres away from his house. The forest and local police teams had launched a search operation which ended after 40 hours when the boy’s body was recovered in the forest area of Down Dale. Over 50 police and forest department team members were engaged in the search operation. Shimla’s Sadar station house officer (SHO) Sandeep Chaudhary said the autopsy would be conducted on Sunday morning and legal proceedings would be carried out accordingly after the report is received. “On Friday, the police had recovered the pants of the child nearly 100 metres below his house. Today, skull bones, some parts of the body and clothes were recovered from the spot,” he added. “The search operation was launched soon after the matter was reported to the police. It is difficult to conclude whether the child was attacked by an animal,” the SHO said. Kedarnath, father of the child, suspected that leopard had taken away Yograj. “Since his body parts have been recovered from the forest area, it’s certain that some wild animal killed him,” he added. This is the second such incident in three months in Shimla. In August, a five-year-old girl was taken away from Kanlog locality and mauled to death by a leopard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mutilated-body-of-5-year-old-boy-found-in-shimla-leopard-attack-suspected-101636251102010.html
07-11-2021||Chandigarh||Jai Ram pulls up HP bureaucrats over delay in development projects||Himachal chief minister Jai Ram Thakur on Saturday pulled up state’s bureaucracy over delays in execution of projects. “The government would not tolerate laxity of any kind in the execution of development projects and would not hesitate in taking stern action against the erring officials,” Jai RamThakur said while giving a clear message to bureaucracy at a meeting of administrative secretaries of HP government here. This comes a couple of days after the Congress defeated BJP candidates in the bypolls to Mandi Lok Sabha seat and Fatehpur, Jubbal and Kotkhai and Arki Vidhan Sabha seats. ‘Misgovernance’ of the Jai Ram Thakur government is said to be one of the factors that went against the BJP in the recently concluded bypolls. Jai Ram asked the officers to lay special thrust to ensure that the development projects and issues related to common people were redressed on priority. The CM also directed the officers to resolve the issues of recruitment of various categories, JOA(IT), JBT, PTI, NTT which have been delayed due to one reason or another. Special focus must be laid on recruitments on compassionate grounds as this would not only benefit the family members of the deceased but also provide employment to the needy, he added. Jai Ram said that all development projects which have been hanging fire due to cases pending in the NGT must also be expedited. “Projects particularly related to various departments are not only being delayed but the people are also not getting the benefits of these projects in time. The delay is resulting in cost escalation,” he added. The CM said that special focus must be laid on achieving the targets related to various development projects. He said that work on projects of PWD in respect of NABARD and PMGSY should be completed in time. He also asked the officers to maintain better coordination between various departments so that progress of the projects does not get hampered. He also directed the officers to ensure proper maintenance of various roads in the state.Jai Ram said a special emphasis must be laid on the effective implementation of the chief minister’s announcements. He said that slackness in this regard would be viewed seriously. He also directed the administrative secretaries to identify chronic issues of their respective departments so that these could be redressed at the earliest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jai-ram-pulls-up-hp-bureaucrats-over-delay-in-development-projects-101636250861957.html

The police, however, said that they had no information about the sexual assault.A relative of the woman said her husband came to know about the alleged assault on Thursday after a villager informed him that obscene photos of his wife were being circulated on WhatsApp.“My brother asked her about the photos, she told him that a labourer raped her a few weeks ago. She didn’t inform anyone about the assault due to social stigma. On Tuesday, the labourer came to her house with two others and tried to assault her again. When she foiled their bid, he circulated the images of the assault,” the woman’s brother-in-law said.The police maintained that they were carrying out a thorough investigation. “We came to know about the suicide of the woman but didn’t receive any information of rape,”Bagchini police station in-charge Praveen Tripathi said.If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist.

07-11-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC polls: Parties tap into power of social media to reach out to voters||Social media, mobile apps and big data are being tapped into a big way as political parties step up their campaign for the Chandigarh municipal corporation election. While social media tools such as WhatsApp, Telegram and Facebook are being used to share the party vision, big data is being used to know the electorate better and run a “sharper” campaign. The MC will go to the polls in December. Staring at anti-incumbency, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is banking on a campaign message focused on “development” to retain its majority in the House. BJP state president Arun Sood said the party’s social media strategy is one of the three pillars of its campaign. “We will not go for large public gatherings this time around. Personal contact, door-to-door campaign and social media will be our three pillars,” he said. The party has created booth-wise WhatsApp groups for all the 595 booths in the city. The voters of a pooling booth are made members of these groups. “As there is a limit on the number of members in a group, we try to include the lead member of every family in the area. The booth pradhan is the group administrator. He knows the local issues and has the data of all people in the locality,” said Sood. Weaved around its development plank, the BJP has shot small duration videos showcasing its “achievements” in the past five years. These videos, generally tailored to a particularly area, are then being shared on these groups. “We have created 60-90 second videos on 50 development achievements,” said the party present.Meanwhile, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is encouraging its party workers to create videos concerning different issues of their wards and the city. These videos will be shared on different social media platforms, particularly WhatsApp and Telegram groups. Bikram Dhawan, senior vice-president, AAP, Chandigarh, said: “We have created WhatsApp group in different wards for party workers. Telegram groups have also been created as they give more flexibility. The groups will also help us have a two-way communication with the electorate.” For the Congress, a control room has been created in its Sector 35 city headquarters. HS Lucky, chief spokesperson, Chandigarh Congress, said: “Our dedicated social media team is ready and is managing the control room. In coming days, we will step up the momentum of our social media campaign with videos and text messages. Satirical videos on inflation and other public-related issues are already doing very well with people.” The party has also made WhatsApp groups in wards and is also encouraging its workers to communicate with voters in other groups, such as those of resident welfare associations. Big dataWith its focus still on the membership drive, the AAP has created a specific mobile app for its workers to help expand its party base in the city and create a wide database. “The app has detailed information about the electorate in every ward of the city. After interacting with people, we can also add more details about a family and create specific profiles. With more information about people, like what issues concern them and what type of candidate they want, we can create a sharper campaign strategy in the days to come,” said Dhawan. The app also helps the party keep a tab on the performance of its workers in the membership drive. Even in the last election, parties had made use of data related to electorate and social media. However, this time around, the focus is on streamlining the message, said party insiders. “The social media use pattern has changed a lot since the last election. Different social media platforms are being used to approach different sets of electorate. The message is also being made crisper as people don’t even have time to watch small videos as their WhatsApp and Telegram groups are already full of messages,” said Mahendra Kumar Nirala, convener, IT Cell, Chandigarh BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-mc-polls-parties-tap-into-power-of-social-media-to-reach-out-to-voters-101636236330432.html

They are former mayor Poonam Sharma, Chandigarh Resident Association of Welfare Federation (CRAWFED) chairman Hitesh Puri and BJP leader Surinder Bahga. As per an order issued by the UT Adviser Dharam Pal, they will now be able to participate in meetings of the committee. CHB’s board of directors had constituted the eight-member committee on September 14 under the chairmanship of its secretary. CHB’s chairman, chief engineer, chief architect, architect, executive engineer (design), executive engineer (public health), executive engineer (electrical) and executive engineer (enforcement) are also members. Notably, the non-official members had last week supported the demand of long-time allottees for a one-time settlement for all violations. They also recommended an increase in the floor area ratio. The members favoured an amnesty scheme in Chandigarh on the lines of the Delhi module. In Delhi, there were 5 lakh residents facing demolition/cancellation orders for additions made to their houses. As it was not possible to demolish all such houses that had come up in the last 20 to 30 years, they increased the FAR and regularised the unauthorised constructions while charging one-time usage charges and never gave the legal right for extra construction beyond permissible limit. “A similar situation has risen in Chandigarh, as more than 60,000 residents are living under the threat of demolition /cancellation of their houses as they have covered extra area beyond permissible, but within boundary line,” they submitted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/needbased-changes-3-special-invitees-included-to-chb-panel-101636235430078.html

CPCC member secretary Debendra Dalai said, “Not many crackers were burst on Friday but temperature had gone down on Friday night, so it is likely that temperature inversion played some role in this as well. Rest we urge people to follow the cracker ban as it is in their best interest.”The AQI had gone down to poor from 7 pm onwards and it took till midnight for the AQI to come down in the moderate bracket (below 200).

Since the offending construction was found in a plot area of more than 500 square metres, the environmental compensation was kept at ₹50,000,” he said.The NCRTC, however, said that all norms prescribed by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to mitigate pollution are being religiously followed at all RRTS construction sites, including Anand Vihar.“Anti-smog guns are operational round the clock to curb the dust, apart from regular sprinkling of water to settle the dust. Excavated soil and construction material are duly kept covered. C&D waste is being disposed of as per prescribed norms. Mechanized cleaning of roads through brooming machines is being done on a regular basis. High-pressure tyre washing facilities are also in operation to remove mud and dust from heavy truck tyres. The site is duly barricaded (2 to 4 mt height) near the smog tower at Anand Vihar to isolate it, the NCRTC said in a statement.“A dedicated team of environment and safety experts is duly monitoring these steps round the clock to ensure their effectiveness,” it added.Delhi’s air has been in the severe category of the air quality index since Diwali ( November 4), owing to a sharp increase in stubble burning in neighbouring and large-scale violations of the firecracker ban in Delhi on Diwali. The Delhi government on Saturday dispatched over 100 water tankers to sprinkle water on the roads to mitigate dust.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/east-mcd-fines-ncr-transport-body-50k-for-dust-at-rrts-site-101636234806254.html

07-11-2021||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz | Era of blood sport’s power||With the recent demise of Rai Shiv Chand of Bhallan, Nangal, at the ripe old age of 90, a distinctive era of the ‘power shikar’ culture embracing apex elites of the political, bureaucratic, army and erstwhile nobility came to an unheralded end. Chand was an influential jagirdar and a shikar chieftain who organised wild boar hunts across the Sutlej flanks and Shivalik ravines in peerless fashion from the 1960s-’80s. His house guests for a juicy boar barbeque attracted none less than politicians PS Badal, Captain Amarinder Singh, former Western Army commanders, Lt Gens KP Candeth and PN Hoon, the ‘flying Sikh’, Milkha Singh, the erstwhile hill rajahs and the cream of the Punjab IAS and IPS.“We organised 300-400 beaters, 150 hunting dogs and 40-50 guns for a boar shoot on the then CM Badal’s request in 1978,” Chand’s son, Tikka Yashvir Chand, told this writer. During that hunt, a shikari shot a sambar, which was banned under law. A Sambar poaching case was registered against Chand, which dragged on. But then apex bureaucrat and an inveterate partridge shikari, the late Kamal Nain Singh, came to Chand’s rescue.A chairman of the block/panchayat samitis, the popular Chand had told this writer before his death: “My modus operandi was simple. I would tell villagers: lend your shoulder to VVIP shoots by coming as beaters, boar trackers etc. A successful shoot helped me greatly to get their ‘works’ done with the government.” True to his word, following the proverbial Sunday shoot, Chand would land at the Civil Secretariat, Chandigarh, on Monday. His grand shikars paid handsome dividends: a red carpet would replace the proverbial red tape for his long list of ‘mere lokaan de kam’.Sporting handlebar moustaches, a 30.06 Winchester rifle and a tongue laced with saucy wit, Chand’s shikar recounts speared the high and mighty. The time when a sozzled hill rajah urinated in his pyjamas at Chand’s country mansion after a boar shoot as he could not get the strings undone in time. That IAS officer KS Bains was such a poor shot at flying partridge that it took a Herculean effort to keep lips locked. Chand was eye-witness to the ‘flying Sikh’ abandoning a sinking country boat on the Sutlej, leaving six-year-old Jeev in the lurch.The son of Rai Bahadur Hari Chand, an MLA of the Punjab assembly before and after Partition, Shiv Chand was appointed member, State Wildlife Advisory Board, in 1985, 2002 and 2017. He was sacked overnight in 2018 after he wrote a letter to Amarinder detailing a ruling heavyweight’s indulgence in ecological destruction and the sand mafia. Diwali bonanzaA ramble along the serene Sukhna Lake Nature Trail yields sightings of birds, animals and insects, apart from an occasional serpent. One creature to consistently defy a clear view is the Sukhna’s golden jackal. These agile creatures -- disreputed as ‘darpok gidhars’ in Punjabi lore -- are nevertheless a doughty species adapting to almost any environment.Their stealth presence at the Sukhna is revealed dramatically by eerie howls emitted at dusk and dawn, vocalisations that humans are more familiar with than the animal itself. Burrows engineered by Indian crested porcupine and inhabited jointly in relative harmony with rock pythons are situated off the trail and deeper in the Sukhna jungles. But some of these burrows bear signs of vicious conflicts with jackals, who seek to evict the residents and turn the multi-chambered, ready-made subterranean dwellings into dens for rearing pups.Well-known tricity IT entrepreneur, angel investor and international marathoner Munish Jauhar had attempted to photograph the jackals over the past year, but all he got for his exertions were visions of vanishing fur. Then, on Diwali, in the forenoon, lady luck smiled on Jauhar upon his venturing to the trail for a relaxing ramble.There he spotted a jackal equally enjoying the lonesome trail bereft of humans due to the festivities. The jackal was not edgy as normal and was sniffing the clean, cool air. Adopting a stealthy approach, Jauhar’s long lens was at last enabled to capture the Sukhna’s ‘sharmilee spirit’. vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wildbuzz-era-of-blood-sport-s-power-101636234710958.html
07-11-2021||Chandigarh||Farmers stall Sooryavanshi screening at 2 multiplexes in Zirakpur||High drama was witnessed outside two multiplexes, Dhillon Plaza and Cosmo Plaza, in Zirakpur on Saturday as a group of farmers, protesting against agricultural reforms, reached there to stop the screening of Akshay Kumar-starrer Sooryavanshi .In August too, farmers had stopped the screening of Akshay Kumar starrer Bell Bottom. Farmers alleged that the film Sooryavanshi favours PM Narendra Modi, who according to them is “anti-farmer” as he has passed “Tughlaki” bills which will ruin the future of farmers. The farmers said Akshay Kumar had become a “puppet in the PM’s hands” because of which they are opposing the screening of his film. Bhartiya Kisan Union (Sidhupur), Mohali, vice-president Kirpal Singh Siau said, “Narendra Modi has planned to ruin the future of farmers, while film actors like Akshay Kumar are blindly following in his footsteps. We will not allow his films to run in Punjab.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farmers-stall-sooryavanshi-screening-at-2-multiplexes-in-zirakpur-101636234410459.html
07-11-2021||Chandigarh||Guest column | The quiet dignity of the hero of Bangladesh||A few years after I retired, I was invited by my alma mater, Military College of Electronics and Mechanical Engineering, Secunderabad, to share my thoughts on professional ethics in the corps with trainee officers. I had to take an early flight from New Delhi to be able to address the officers in a two-hour post-lunch session. I was standing patiently in the ‘economy’ check-in queue, when I spotted a tall handsome gentleman in a light-coloured suit and regimental tie, whose face looked familiar, a few steps ahead in the jumbled line. Soon, I realized that he was none other than lieutenant general Jagjit Singh Aurora (retd), the hero of Bangladesh.We had met very briefly at the India International Centre on an earlier occasion. The decorated three stars general, who had many firsts to his credit, was considered an epitome of civilized behaviour, man of spotless integrity and a highly-rated professional soldier. He was cool and calm and waited patiently for his turn. After confirming my position with the lady behind me, I stepped out and said, “Good morning, sir.” Needless to say, he was pleased to meet me and also recalled meeting me earlier.Suddenly, a self-important woman with sunglasses perched dangerously on her forehead arrived from nowhere and attracted glances from one and all. She behaved as though she owned the airport and looked down at the rest of us with an ‘I could not care less’ attitude. I saw two youngsters pushing autograph books towards the woman, who turned out to be a south Indian actor. I also realised that the staff manning the business-class counter was going out of the way to be extra nice to the passengers. I felt helpless at my plight and continued waiting for my turn till a burly Sikh at the counter rudely snatched the ticket from my hand. Normally I’d have taken objection to such a conduct, but good sense prevailed and I held my peace. Sometime later, I observed a number of people running around in obvious excitement. It took me some time to understand the reason. A short, fat man in his forties, with marigold garlands around his neck, was waiving furiously at his supporters who were raising slogans outside the gate. The burly Sikh at the ‘economy’ counter, who had not bothered to even look at me, while handing over the ticket to me only a few minutes earlier, had taken upon himself the responsibility of escorting the ‘neta ji’ to a safe place, away from the prying eyes of ordinary mortals like me. People were shoving each other to shake hands with the VIP, while an important-looking lady requested someone to take her snap with the leader. He was the centre of attraction and was busy acknowledging the greetings of people gathered around him. The crowd kept adding and ‘neta ji’ seemed to be enjoying every bit of attention he was getting. Pretty soon it was time to board the flight. However, ‘neta ji’ did not have to go through the mandatory security check and was followed by a couple of people who helped him to get to the aircraft. The Lt-Gen and I took our respective seats. On my request, a fellow passenger exchanged his seat so that I could sit next to him. We traveled together and exchanged views, on obvious topics like our political system, governance, and corruption. I often wonder why a small-time politician from God knows which political party who, in all probability, lacked almost every trait civilized human beings are characterized by was so important and a gallant soldier, who along with many others was responsible for helping his countrymen live free with dignity, was neglected. No one had noticed and recognised the man whose photographs were splashed in all newspapers of the world during the 1971 Indo-Pak conflict. He had politely taken his own turn in the queue in the ‘economy’ class but a starlet and the rowdy politician had hogged all the limelight.

The petition was filed by the wife and five children of the victim, Ramcharan of Shamtoo village of Panchkula, stating that they were on the verge of starvation following his death.The victim’s wife, Reena Devi, 33, stated that on February 22, 2019, Ramcharan was heading to Sarawan village of Yamunanagar on motorcycle. His nephew, Gurmeet, and uncle, Puneet Kumar, were following him on another motorcycle.As they reached Bhurewala village of Ambala, a speeding bike rammed into the victim’s two-wheeler, leaving him grievously injured.

07-11-2021||Chandigarh||Random Forays | The inimitable charm of book launches||Some of my most memorable moments have been spent while attending book launches and basking in their literary glows. People who make it convenient to be present at a book launch, despite the pulls, pressures, deadlines and targets of today’s world, generally feel elevated afterwards.Book launches are occasions to savour and relish. No such event leaves the audience feeling morose, shaken or put off. Barring the usual exceptions, book launches are feel-good, uplifting and elevating experiences. The author in question usually looks and behaves like a newly-wed, glowing at all the praise which inevitably comes his or her way. He blushes quite often too. Guests who are invited to deliver speeches are typically erudite, expressive and distinguished individuals. Such luminaries make it a point to praise not only the book but also the author to the skies. At times some suggestions for the author’s future journey will also be offered, especially by those who have long traversed the same dusty pathways.The lighter side of a book launch also deserves a mention or two. Most attendees are there not so much for the love of books but for the love of the host. And the host usually is the writer himself. He will thus keep an eye on the doorway to see who all have actually popped in, knowing well that an invitation to cocktails would have ensured more footfall. Book launches are normally morning or afternoon affairs. Tea, coffee and cakes are more the norm at these dos than the bubblier stuff. Some individuals show up just to be seen at an intellectual gathering for a change. Others simply want to exchange glances with the author who is on stage and mark their presence. They will then make their exit asap, since they are usually headed to more entertaining jaunts thereafter. Why waste an opportunity to have some real fun now that they’re all dressed up?But to be fair, such escapees are not many in number. A large portion of the gathering at a book launch will genuinely enjoy the whiff and feel of an embalming afternoon, well aware that coffee and conversation are in the offing. Such human beings will also share some of the author’s glee at having accomplished the life long objective of becoming a published writer. Even those who have been there and done that before will never tire of the adulation and affection that they receive at their umpteenth book launch.Our Chandigarh Literary Society has organised dozens of these launches and continues to do so, thereby giving fledgling authors the hope that they too, one day, will be propelled to the stage and to the limelight. Which brings me very humbly to the subject of the recent launch of “It’s Still A Wonderful Life” published by Ferntree, which, happily, is a collection of 120 of these random forays. This column is as much the reader’s property, as it is mine or the Hindustan Times’. Together we have traversed five long years, and the upheavals, highs and lows of life have been encapsulated by this columnist to the best of his ability. The endeavour of this column has been to foray into as many territories as possible without treading into the unknown. Thus, from love and relationships to social media and governance, one has been able to paint a largish canvas.The aim, above all, has been to leave the reader with some hope for the future, some balm for the mind, and some calm for the soul. Thus, to choose the title of one of these pieces to be the title of the book, was not a tough decision.An author’s life is not just about writing, though it is primarily that. It is also about editing, getting published, promoting one’s work and then basking in glory, however dimly lit the horizon may be.“Success comes to a writer, as a rule, so gradually that it is always something of a shock to him to look back and realize the heights to which he has risen”, said my favourite man of words, PG Wodehouse. Book launches are celebrations which assure writers that “It’s still a wonderful life”, after all!vivek.atray@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/random-forays-the-inimitable-charm-of-book-launches-101636234109849.html
07-11-2021||Chandigarh||Roundabout | Singing it anew: Song of Malwa’s Rani Rupmati||This fortnight, our journey is to Malwa, but the one in the south-east of Punjab - the volcanic upland beyond the Vindhya Range in Madhya Pradesh. To tell you the truth, one did not know like many other Punjabis that Malwa existed elsewhere other than the one in their own state. One recalls a mushaira at our city’s Tagore Theatre, way back in the 70s, where the late poet, Ali Sardar Jafri, referred to the Malwa region of central India as he recited his famous love couplet: ‘Har ashiq hai Sardar yahan, har mashooqa Sultana hai’. (Here every lover is Sardar and every beloved a Sultana’. He was playing on his own name and that of his wife, but many of us desi folks thought that he was referring to us sardars and our own Malwa region of Bathinda fame. He had to clarify that his intent was to pun on his own name and that of Baz Bahadur, the Sultan of Malwa.Yes, one is suddenly in the throes of the love legend of Rani Rupmati and Baz Bahadur, which stepped out of history into myth way back in the 16th century. The reason being that the Rani, famed for her beauty and often referred to as the lotus lady, has returned to retell her story. Believe it or not, but this is what poet and scholar Priyadarshi Thakur ‘Khayal’ says of his debut novel in English titled ‘Padmini of Malwa: The Autobiography Of Rani Ruupmati’. The extra ‘u’ in the name is to get the phonetics right. Doing research on this tragic story of love, for we in India enjoy our love tragedies just as much as the western world does its love comedies, the author almost gave up till Rupmati appeared in person to dictate her story to him. Believe me, such things do happen to writers for their imagination is more vivid than the rest. So, the author humbly affirms that it is the Rani telling her story and he is merely her scribe. He adds, “Love and marriage between individuals from different faiths and communities not entirely at peace with each other was an extremely sensitive subject in the Rani’s time, and continues to be so, to this day. On behalf of Rani Rupmati, this scribe therefore asks his readers for the humanity and understanding that this story deserves.”A riveting taleBaz Bahadur was the last independent sultan of Malwa and a musician to boot. Rupmati was poet, singer and musician with Raag Bhoop Kalyan to her credit, besides being an exceptional beauty. These star-crossed lovers of the times of Mughal emperor Akbar lost each other with the Rupmati taking her life at the age of 21, after six years of a passionate union, and Baz fleeing Mandu after being defeated by Adham Khan, who had been sent by the emperor to conquer Mandu.Priyadarshi tells the story so well that one cannot put down the novel, once one starts reading it - right from Rupmati’s childhood to her last breath. Fact and fable come together with such appeal and creativity that one is almost transported to those times in the forest of Malwa and the building of the palace of Mandu with its Reva-kund because his love wants to catch a view of the Narmada River for it was on its banks that she grew up and in local parlance it is called Reva. What is interesting is the handling of the condition of women in the feudal times when battles were fought over their bodies.Rupmati, like other women of her times, are mere objects for the men who own them by birth or abduction. Here the courageous young Rupmati chooses her own path and follows the heart’s desire. Even the great love between the two has to deal with this contradiction. Rupmati, like other women of her times, are mere objects for the men who own them by birth or abduction. Here the courageous young Rupmati chooses her own path and follows the heart’s desire. Even the great love between the two has to deal with this contradiction. Referring to the self-immolation by Rani Padmini of Chittor, Baz, says: “I have got my Padmini without much ado…” The era with its mood and frailties is captured with finesseLegends never dieFact or fiction, legends never die and more so those of love. The story of Rupmati and Baz Bahadur has been told over and again in folk songs, ballads and poems over the centuries. In 1975, SN Tripathi made a feature film Rani Rupmati with yesteryear stars Nirupa Roy, goddess of the mythological films of yore, playing Rupmati and Bharat Bhushan, Baz. A song from the film composed by Tripathi and written by Bharat Vyas and sung by Lata Mangeshkar and Mukesh, respectively, is evergreen even today: ‘Aaa laut ke aaja mere meet, tujhe mere geet bulate hain’ (Return to me my love, My songs call out to you). Madhya Pradesh tourism thrives in Mandu as a holiday destination for lovers and bards still sing ballads to the tragic lovers. This year, it has started its own cultural festival.nirudutt@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/roundabout-singing-it-anew-song-of-malwa-s-rani-rupmati-101636233810222.html
07-11-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC to transfer management of internal market parking lots to traders||The municipal corporation is all set to transfer the management and running of parking lots in all internal markets to the market associations concerned.The market associations will either run these parking lots free of cost or charge nominal rates. MC will be signing a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the associations to lay down the modalities for parking handover and operation.All markets on the V4 (internal) roads are to be transferred to the associations.Confirming the development, MC commissioner Anindita Mitra said an agenda on the issue will be submitted before the MC General House meet.The Chandigarh Beopar Mandal (CBM), an umbrella organisation of 80 market associations, has been holding meetings with MC officials on the issue. “There are two models and corresponding two MoU shortlisted. We will either operate the parking free of cost, or charge at cost to cover expenses, which will come at around ₹5 for car parking and ₹2 for scooter parking. The final decision on the issue will be taken by the House,” said Charanjiv Singh, nominated councilor and president, CBM.There are around 60 such markets, though under MC, but are not being managed by it. There is a lot of chaos in the internal markets. MC’s attempts to bring these parking lots under the purview of private parking contractors, has been opposed by the market associations. Associations contend that handing over the parking to contractors will increase parking rates, making the markets unattractive for shoppers.“The associations would manage these parking lots better than the private contractors. We don’t have any profit in running parking. Our aim is only to organise the parking in a better way so that visitors don’t face any hassles. In our experience, better organised market parking make these more attractive to shoppers,” said Singh.The market associations will pool their own fund if required to cover the expenses of managing these parking spaces.Notably, the city has currently, 89 parking lots under the management of private contractors. These cover all the main markets, office centres, commercial and institutional areas. The charges here are ₹12 for car and ₹5 for two-wheelers.The working and efficiency of these parking contractors have come under scanner in recent times. MC has repeatedly fined the parking contractors for failing to manage the parking lots properly and as per their contract with the MC.“The market associations can do a better job as they are the stakeholders in the market. Handing over the parking to market associations is a win-win situation for the MC, associations and the shoppers,” added Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-mc-to-transfer-management-of-internal-market-parking-lots-to-traders-101636233629646.html
07-11-2021||Chandigarh||Tricity buzz | How old is Chandigarh? 55 or 70? Residents agree to disagree||Is Chandigarh 55 or 70 years old? Last week, the UT Administration celebrated 55 years of City Beautiful’s foundation; some official releases used the word formation. On November 1, 1966, the city was designated a Union Territory, the joint capital of Punjab and the newly created state of Haryana. The administration marked November 1 as the city’s formation/foundation day, but some residents disagreed. Their contention: The foundation stone of the city was laid in 1952, and this should be considered its formation day, and not when it got the status of a UT. “If it’s about the city, it’s 70 years since its formation. The change of legal nomenclature or jurisdiction happened on November 1, 1966, but it shouldn’t be considered as its foundation day,” said a resident. A senior official contended, “On November 1, 1966, the city was declared a UT and by convention, it is considered the foundation day. So, the administration followed the tradition.” Cops crack down on cracker ban violators Enforcing the ban on the sale and bursting of firecrackers in Chandigarh this Diwali kept UT cops on their toes. Residents flocked to neighbouring Mohali, where crackers were easily available, and the ban went up in smoke on D-day. The 600 cops deployed to maintain law and order on Diwali night ended up chasing cracker enthusiasts, who would scurry for cover the moment they heard the siren of a police vehicle. Ex-minister Balbir Sidhu visits Mohali gaushala on Diwali On Diwali, former Punjab minister Balbir Singh Sidhu took time out to offer prayers at the Bal Gopal Gaushala in Balongi, Mohali, and later fed cattle fodder. A three-time Congress MLA, he is set to contest the assembly elections from Mohali early next year. A sweet gesture from SP With 600 Chandigarh Police personnel on law and order duty in the city on Diwali, superintendent of police (SP), city, Ketan Bansal was seen meeting and greeting his men on the ground. Bansal distributed sweets to the cops on duty and completed the celebrations. Rough patch on road to Chandigarh’s glitzy mall Chandigarh’s Elante Mall buzzes with customers from across the region once the festive season arrives. But the one impression that many visitors take back is of the potholed and broken road leading to the mall in Chandigarh’s Industrial Area. There is one patch that is always in need of repair and drives visitors to take the wrong way, leading to accidents. Weather god ensures city breathes easy this Diwali While the air quality index (AQI) in Chandigarh fell in the severe category on Diwali night, the weather god ensured that the city woke up to clean air on Friday. According to pollution control officials, at its peak, the air quality had gotten much worse than previous years, however winds blowing in the region from the northwest ensured that pollution was reduced. Diwali was celebrated relatively early before the temperature fell and air quality was back to normal within hours. NEET result finally out after long wait The National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) result for admission to medical colleges in the country was declared last week after giving students sleepless nights. While the Supreme Court had given the National Testing Agency the green signal to release the results last week itself, students had to wait till Monday evening. The results were emailed to students and all emails weren’t sent out at the same time due to which many students had to wait anxiously even while their peers were already celebrating. The coaching centres were also in a fix, checking with their toppers and verifying the results in a race against the clock, while the deadline of newspapers drew near. Excitement back at PU as students prepare for fests College students have begun preparing for the zonal youth festivals of Panjab University. The university has 12 zones, including Chandigarh, and the festivals will be held in this month itself. Students excelling in zonal festivals will participate in the inter-zonal youth festival in December. The students had missed the youth festival last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic but excitement is back on the campus again this year.

The rates have been increased by the MC in the parking lots under its control. It is an unjustified action initiated by the Panchkula MC.”The association has demanded that the MC should streamline the disparity of charging the parking fee in the public interest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/panchkula-citizens-welfare-association-seeks-uniform-parking-rates-101636232009181.html

In his statement to police, Prof Goyal said that on the intervening night of Wednesday and Thursday, his wife was sleeping in a bedroom of the ground floor while he was in a room on the first floor. Their daughter was not present in the house. On Thursday, around 7:30 in the morning, he received a call on his mobile phone from his milkman, who told him to collect milk packets left at the main gate. When he came down to the ground floor, he was unable to open the main door. He then went to the gate using the kitchen door and later found that the main door was locked from outside. On entering the house again, he went to his wife’s room, and reportedly found her lying unconscious on the bed, with her hands and legs tied with a cloth. She was rushed to Government Multi Specialty Hospital (GMSH), Sector 16, where she was declared brought dead.Marks on neck, head A senior official of Chandigarh police, privy to the investigation, said, “There were strangulation marks on the victim’s neck and some injuries on her head. As per preliminary findings, asphyxia was the cause of death but we are waiting for the complete report.”No sign of forced entry Senior police officials added that investigations so far do not suggest forced entry, however, they have found the mesh doors of the kitchen and a bedroom in which Seema was found murdered, tampered with. “The investigations do not suggest forced entry but the mesh of two doors were slightly removed, so entry by opening the door bolts cannot be ruled out,” added the senior police official. Police added that even closed-circuit television cameras in the area have so far been unable to throw up any clues about the accused. Sources said no one has been seen entering or leaving the house in the footage. Superintendent of police (SP, City) Ketan Bansal said, “Two teams are looking into the CCTV footage gathered from the area. We have also collected the mobile dump data. Statements of family members and relatives are being recorded.” No trace of victim’s mobile As per police sources, there is still no trace of the victim’s mobile phone though they have searched the entire house and even used technical surveillance methods.The couple lived with their daughter in an independent house that shares its rear boundary wall with the vice-chancellor’s official residence, a high-security area on the campus. A case was registered against the unknown assailant under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at the police station in Sector 11 on statement of BB Goyal, who was sleeping on the first floor of the house.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pu-murder-preliminary-report-suggests-prof-s-wife-died-of-strangulation-101636231889131.html

07-11-2021||Chandigarh||Garbage heaps an eyesore in Ludhiana after Diwali||Even as residents deep cleaned their houses ahead of the festival of lights, heaps of garbage continued to be an eyesore at secondary dumping sites and along roads after the municipal corporation’s mega cleanliness drive phased out after Diwali on November 4. The accumulated garbage spread across the roads in Shivpuri, Dugri, and Model Town among other areas disturbing the flow of traffic on Saturday. Residents, shopkeepers and commuters also faced a harrowing time. The foul smell that pervaded the area also added to locals’ woes. Shopkeepers have been raising the issue of open dumping time and again, but to no avail. The mega cleanliness drive that had been launched with much fanfare on November 1, ahead of Diwali, has not helped rein in open dumping of garbage across the city. Besides, the MC’s tall claims of installing static compactors under the Smart City Mission have also fallen flat. The proprietor of a shop near the Shivpuri dumpsite, Sandeep, said, “The dump occupies a portion of the road. As large amounts of trash are dumped at the site it eventually spreads out, littering the roads and the area around our shops. The unhygienic conditions affects both – our health and our business.” “When we take up the matter with MC officials, they ask us to name an alternative site. The staff deputed at the dump site also misbehaves with residents,” he alleged. Mayor Balkar Sandhu and municipal corporation commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal had also inspected the different dump sites across the district, including the defunct static compactor site near the Dugri Canal Bridge on November 2 and directed authorities to expedite the process to lifting the garbage on a daily basis.A resident of Guru Gyan Vihar, Gurmeet Singh, said,” Heaps of garbage can be seen at Dugri Point on any given day. Authorities claim that the compactors have developed a snag, which shows their lackadaisical approach. As the dump site is situated near the traffic lights, it is difficult to stand at the signal due to the foul smell.”Officials, however, say that around 1,100 metric tons of garbage is generated in the city on a daily basis, which increases to over 1,700 metric tonnes on Diwali, which increases the pressure on dump sites. MC health officer Vipal Malhotra said, “Though half-day leave was given to the staff on Diwali and Vishwakarma Day, but the lifting process was not hit. On Saturday, too, MC staff and the contractor company’s staff were lifting the garbage from different points. Work will continue till midnight to clear the dump sites.”The city has around 40 secondary dump sites. The waste collected from houses is dumped at the secondary dump sites, from where it is shifted to the main dump site of the MC at Tajpur Road.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/garbage-heaps-an-eyesore-in-ludhiana-after-diwali-101636231289701.html

SAD also demanded an executive decision to stop the implementation of the three farm laws passed by the centre, last year. The issues were taken up in the party’s top decision making body, the core committee, meeting held on Saturday, chaired by the party president Sukhbir Singh Badal. “The Congress government in state is befooling the people of Punjab by offering a Vidhan Sabha resolution on these two issues, while the fact is the government is empowered to stop the implementation of the Centre’s orders on issues which fall under the state government’s jurisdiction,” said Sukhbir. “It is for the executive to decide what its administrative machinery would allow or disallow in the state. The Vidhan Sabha resolution is at best an expression of intent,” said a resolution passed by the SAD Core Committee. On the core committee proceedings, principal adviser to the SAD president Harcharan Bains, said party leaders also slammed the decision of the Centre to extend the provisions of J&K anti-terror act to Punjab also, calling it an assault on federalism. According to Bains, the core committee also blasted Channi and state Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu for endorsing the elevation of Jagdish Tytler in the party by the high command. Another resolution by the core committee condemned the repression unleashed on the peacefully protesting SAD workers outside the CM’s residence on Saturday. The core committee also demanded a compensation of ₹50,000 and ₹15,000 per acre respectively to farmers and farm labour affected by the crop damage due to Pink Bollworm.“The compensation of ₹12,000 announced by the Channi govt is a joke on farmers and farm labour,” said the committee. Another resolution came down heavily against the closure of a large number of agricultural markets in Punjab, said BainsBalwinder Singh Bhundar, Bibi Jagir Kaur, Prem Singh Chandumara, Janmeja Singh Sekhon, Daljit Singh Cheema, Bikram Singh Majitha, Sikander Singh Maluka, Hira Singh Gabria, Jagmeet Singh Brar, Gulzar Singh Ranike, Surjit Singh Rakhra and Baldev Singh Mann were also present.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pass-order-to-stop-extension-of-bsf-jurisdiction-sad-core-panel-101636230628934.html

Sekhri claimed that he will write to Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi and the Congress high command, complaining about the behaviour of Bajwa, who is the serving MLA from the adjoining constituency Fatehgarh Churian.Batala, the assembly constituency of Gurdaspur, has history of such war of words between Sekhri and Bajwa. To quell this, Sekhri was seen as having been placated with appointment as chairman of the Punjab Health Systems Corporation (PHSC). He also termed Bajwa as super chief minister. Responding to the allegations, Bajwa said, “Whatever is he saying about me makes no sense. Nor is he speaking the truth.”Both the leaders are in feud for long time. Despite being elected from the adjoining constituency, Bajwa takes interest in Batala, which is the stronghold of Sekhri, a prominent Hindu face of the party in the Majha region. The three-time MLA is also staking claim of the party ticket for upcoming assembly elections.After getting made a Punjab minister in 2017, Bajwa started increasing his influence in segment and managed to put his loyalists at the helm in the Batala municipal corporation, Improvement Trust and the Market Committee, thereby marginalising Sekhri. In September last year, Sekhri had filed a police complaint against Bajwa for ‘ignoring’ Covid-19 norms. Sekhri lost the 2017 assembly elections to SAD candidate Lakhbir Singh Lodhinangal by 500 votes.After Sekhri planned to join the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), recently, the then CM Captain Amarinder Singh gave him the key post of PHSC chairman. Bajwa then sided with the anti-Amarinder faction at the state level. After this, Bajwa’s wings were clipped and his loyalists removed from the Batala local bodies. This paved the way for the re-emergence of Sekhri. However, exit of Capt Amarinder has again resulted in the revival of Bajwa and he ensured his loyalists get the key posts again.Now, despite the post, Sekhri is feeling suffocated in his bastion. His aides are not sure that he will get the party ticket, even as Bajwa has made it clear that he will contest from Fatehgarh Churian.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/factionalism-in-batala-cong-sekhri-claims-bajwa-poses-life-threat-to-him-101636230268682.html

Giving an ultimatum to the VC, they said the body would protest on November 8 if the file was not cleared by the VC till November 7. “The PUTA executive took a serious note of the manner in which the vice-chancellor has manipulated the issue of finalisation of the seniority list of teachers for G-type, F-type, T-1 and T-1 (flats), which was cleared by the DUI, chairperson of the house allotment committee, by keeping the file pending for a long time despite umpteen requests made by PUTA president and secretary in person,” reads the PUTA letter to the VC.The letter also stated that PUTA had also learnt that the vice-chancellor had in an unauthorised manner constituted a committee over and above the syndicate with the mala fide intentions to delay the process and extract a decision of his choice.PUTA said the teachers had been waiting for counselling for house allotment for so long and the last counselling for these houses was held in August 2020. They have urged the VC to clear the file by November 7 or else PUTA will hold a protest in front of the VC office on November 8.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/puta-condemns-delay-in-house-allotment-101636230148594.html

However, if VAT remains higher in Punjab, the movement shall resume after a meeting of the Punjab state executive body.”According to the association, petrol pump dealers are facing losses due to the higher VAT on petrol and diesel compared to the neighbouring states and Chandigarh. The non-revision of dealer margins from the last four years and state-owned oil marketing companies (OMCs) offloading their expenses onto dealers and locking supplies is hitting dealers badly.In the absence of margin revision and high fuel prices, the dealers in the state had earlier decided to limit their work timings for a single shift only from 7 am to 5 pm from November 7 for 15 days to cut their expenses and cover up losses.The Punjab government still hasn’t taken a call on VAT and petrol pump dealers in Mohali are facing losses with fuel in Chandigarh and Chandigarh being sold much cheaper.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hopeful-of-reduction-in-vat-punjab-petroleum-dealers-defer-protest-101636229728411.html

Over the past three days, 12,301 cases have been reported; this is around 37% of 32,734 cases reported to date this season. In 2019, 4,741 active fire events were captured, with 3,858 in 2020.In the figures to date, 2020 had seen 52,890 cases much higher than this year. The number, however, is expected to spike this year, as untimely rain has delayed the harvest of paddy this year. Sangrur has reported 608 farm fires, the highest in Punjab; Barnala 351; Bathinda 252; Moga 422; Ludhiana 398 and Patiala 266. “After the Majha region, now the spurt of farm fires is in the Malwa region. The air quality is set to deteriorate for the next few days, as farmer unions oppose the central laws by burning straw,” said an agricultural department official.As far as the AQI is concerned, Patiala, Ludhiana, Bathinda recorded AQI above 300 (meant to denote emergency health situations). There is visible smog in the air of Patiala, Sangrur, Ludhiana and adjoining areas.

The identification of these spots started two years ago, with the initiative of the Tandarust Mission, Punjab, that a private organisation is funding. The survey in the remaining ten districts of Punjab is underway and after its completion, the total number of fatal spots is expected to touch 800. According to the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), a road accident black (death) spot on the national highways is a stretch on the highway of 500-600metre on which either five road accidents have taken place over the past three years or mishaps involving fatalities/grievous injuries or 10 fatalities within the same time frame. The report pinpoints ten most deadly spots in these districts, where 261 deaths have occurred in three years from January 2017 to December 2019, of which the most fatal spots are Malakpur T-point in Ropar district where 54 deaths have occurred due to accidents, Gurdwara Nabha Sahib, Mohali (46) and Tajpur-cut-Samrala Chowk-Vardhman Chowk, Ludhiana (31). Subsequent to this report compiled by the Punjab Road Safety and Traffic Research Centre, Mohali, the NHAI has started taking corrective steps on the roads it has built. Authority added that works to the tune of ₹300 crore have been identified. 13 deaths a day from 2011-2019, state police recordFrom 2011 to 2019, 42,658 persons had died in road accidents, with a daily average of 13 deaths, record with the state police shows. There were 58,269 accidents on the state’s roads in which 42,658 people lost their lives and 35,606 were injured. The year 2016 was deadliest, when 6,952 accidents took place and 5,077 lives were lost. “Road fatalities is the product of human error, road indiscipline, bad road engineering, and inadequate traffic management. The NHAI is spending about ₹300 crore this fiscal to improve accidents black spots, in addition to constructing large number of bypasses and vehicular underpasses at identified spots,” said NHAI adviser Kahan Singh Pannu. He suggested that state government should also strengthen traffic police manpower in proportion to the increased density of vehicles and employ new traffic control technologies. Dr Navdeep Asija, traffic adviser, with the State Road Safety and Traffic Research Centre told HT, “Scanning FIRs related to all the accidents is a tedious process and work remaining districts is going on. Identification of deadly spots and deaths in accidents from cases registered is done by our team,” he added.He added that national highways comprise 4.6% of 72,000-km road network in the state, on which 80% of accidents take place. “The NHAI has asked state to provide data so that corrective steps could be taken,” said Asija. The deadliest hours on the road, in which 20% of fatal accidents take place is between 6 pm and 9pm; in terms of area classification, rural areas of the state account for 59% of accidents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/391-death-spots-dog-punjab-s-roads-in-12-districts-101636229188569.html

We will oppose Akshay and Kangana’s movies until the black laws are repealed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/farmers-object-moga-cinemas-don-t-screen-sooryavanshi-101636228468412.html

Locals said that they spotted the dog with a portion of its left hind leg and the tail blown off. Remnants of the cracker were still tied to it.“It was a friendly street dog which the locals used to feed. Whoever did it took advantage of the animal’s trust. A firecracker was tied to it and when it exploded it ripped apart a portion of the hind leg and the tail,” said Kushal Tiwari, a local who rescued the dog.Animal lovers have condemned the incident and demanded exemplary punishment. “This is shocking. How can any person do such things to an any animal? He should be arrested,” said Arpita Deb, a dog lover.Police have started an inquiry into the case and the dog is undergoing treatment at an NGO.

The DAP is a key input used as a basal dose for the rabi crop particularly wheat and these days farmers are sowing the crop, for which the ideal time is up to November 15. “We need a total of 5.5 lakh tonne of DAP for the entire rabi season out of which 4.8 lakh tonne is required for wheat crop,” said an officer of the state agriculture department, adding that so far 1.72 lakh tonne has been sold to farmers and remaining goes pending. Currently, the state has 67,000 lakh tonne in the stocks.“Licence of retailers and cooperative societies will be cancelled if found indulging in malpractices,” said Nabha, hinting of action against some the retailers found indulging in malpractice. Nabha said 50 rakes of the DAP of have been promised by the Centre, which will add up 1.5 lakh tonne to the stocks.“About 1.5 lakh tonne DAP is deficient this year as compared to previous year during same period. Out government is trying its best to arrange adequate stocks of DAP,” added the minister, attributing shortage to increase in the DAP prices globally. He appealed to retailers, cooperative societies and the individual farmers not to hoard DAP as it will lead to panic buying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dont-hoard-dap-says-punjab-agri-minister-nabha-101636228050264.html
07-11-2021||Other||Appellate tribunal stays Punjab’s PPA termination notices to four power plants||Patiala The Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL) has stayed the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) termination notices that the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) had served to four private power generating plants with effect from October 31. The notice were served to Damodar Valley Corporation and its three entities.The plants that had been served notices were Damodar Valley Corporation’s Durgapur (200MW share), Raghunathpur (300MW share), Bokaro (200MW share) and Meja Urja Power Project (85MW share). The PSPCL had taken this decision after the Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC) gave a ruling that power from the generating stations of Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC), Kolkata; Pragati Power Corporation Limited and Meja Urja Nigam Power Private Limited, aggregating to 885MW, was costly. The APTEL, however, stayed the proceedings of scrapping the PPA in four different appeals. “Prima facie, we have serious doubts as to the invocation of the Regulation 13 of 2012 Regulations, vis-a-vis, long-term PPAs which have been in position since 2006. In the above facts and circumstances, we do find a prima facie case for interim protection to be afforded to the appellant, balance of convenience lying in its favour, the non-grant of such relief likely to result in irreparable loss. In the facts and circumstances, we stay operation of the Orders of the State Commission in so far as it results in the PPA of the appellant with PSPCL in-operational. For clarity, we add that PSPCL will continue to be obliged to procure electricity from the appellant in terms of the PPA till further orders,” the stay orders read. Pertinently, the PSPCL’s proposal of procurement of 885MW of power on long-term basis from Meja, Pragati-III and DVC’s Raghunathpur, Durgapur and Bokaro stations at ₹5.53, ₹4.82, ₹4.61, ₹4.44 and ₹4.39 per unit, respectively, was rejected by the PSERC. The ruling said that it would not be an economically viable proposition, particularly so, when much cheaper power is available in the market. The PSERC had added that the PSPCL should buy power at not more than ₹3 per unit, including fixed and variable cost.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/appellate-tribunal-stays-punjab-s-ppa-termination-notices-to-four-power-plants-101636228048709.html

07-11-2021||Chandigarh||Day after gherao, BJP MP Jangra says farmer agitation on its last legs||A day after the car of Rajya Sabha MP Ram Chander Jangra was gheraoed and attacked by protesting farmers in Haryana’s Hisar district, the BJP leader said farmers were being misguided by the Opposition and the agitation was on its last legs. Jangra was in the city to participate in an event to mark Vishwakarma Day celebrations at Guru Nanak Dev Bhawan on Saturday. Anticipating farmer protests, heavy police presence was seen at the venue.“There will be a major change in Punjab politics in the coming time and OBC category residents, who comprise around 42% voters will support the BJP in forming the government,” he said, adding that an OBC Commission will be constituted in the state should the saffron party come to power.Asserting that PM Narendra Modi and the BJP-led Union government have been working for the betterment of farmers and the BJP is working to implementing Swaminathan report through farm laws, he said, “The farmers have been misguided by the Congress, communists and other opposition parties as the farm laws have been implemented for their overall growth. The Union government is also open to make some changes as suggested by the farmers.”“The agitation is approaching its end. Only a few farmers can now be seen protesting at the borders of Delhi. The agitation will also come to an end in the state,” said Jangra. On any proposed alliance with former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh’s new party, the Punjab Lok Congress, Jangra noncommittedly said that options are always open in politics. Former president Giani Zail Singh’s grandson Inderjeet Singh had organised the event under the banner of All Vishwakarma Ramgarhia Foundation. State chief slams state government for not reducing VAT on fuelAccusing the Congress government in the state of fooling the public with tall promises ahead of the assembly polls, BJP state chief Ashwani Sharma slammed chief minister Charanjit Channi for not reducing VAT on fuel. “The Congress has been asking the Union government to slash excise duty and now when the Modi-government has reduced it, the state government should also reduce VAT on fuel. Their reluctance exposes the hollowness of their promises.” “The Congress government has failed to perform in last four-and-half years and even Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee president Navjot Singh Sidhu has been highlighting the same. The subsidy announced on power has also been announced till March as the government only wants to woo the voters,” said Sharma.Farmers group stages protest While Jangra was claiming that the farmer agitation was approaching its end in the state, a group of around six farmers staged a protest outside the venue at Ferozepur Road amid heavy police deployment. Also, around a dozen farmers staged a protest against the BJP state chief outside the Circuit House. The farmers were, however, stopped by the police at some distance from both the sites.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/day-after-gherao-bjp-mp-jangra-says-farmer-agitation-on-its-last-legs-101636227808605.html
07-11-2021||Chandigarh||Sukbhir, others booked for trying to lay siege to Channi’s residence||Chandigarh Police on Saturday booked Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal and other senior leaders under non-bailable offences for obstructing and causing injuries to the government officials. A number of party leaders and workers were injured when the police cane-charged them when they tried to lay siege to the residence of chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi demanding a reduction of value added tax (VAT) on fuel. The police later took Sukhbir, party leaders and worker into preventive custody at the Sector 39 police station. They were later released and a case under Sections 332 and 353 (obstructing and causing injuries to the public servants) of IPC was registered against them. Led by Sukhbir, Akali protesters raised slogans against the state government for not giving relief to people in petrol and diesel prices by reducing taxes on fuel. Sukhbir slammed the Congress government for not slashing the tax on fuel. “All states have reduced the prices of fuel. But this government has done nothing so far,” he said. He demanded slashing of the retail prices of fuel by ₹10 per litre. The protesters also demanded from the government an adequate compensation to the farmers whose crop was damaged because of recent rains and hailstorm. “Farmers have not received compensation and the state government is sleeping. Farmers have suffered a loss of ₹50,000 per acre. We came here to awake the state government,” Sukhbir said, asking Channi to meet the affected growers. “Farmers are facing a shortage of di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) needed for sowing of their crops,” said Sukhbir. The SAD chief accused Channi and Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu of “fighting” with each other rather than resolving issues of the people. He also asked them about their stand on the appointment of Jagdish Tytler as a permanent invitee to the Delhi Congress’ new executive committee, which was done recently. Tytler for long has been named as one of the main accused in anti-Sikh riots of 1984. Sukhbir was accompanied by other senior Akali leaders, including Bikram Singh Majithia and Daljit Singh Cheema, in his sit-in on the road leading to the chief minister’s residence. Police later detained the Akali leaders and several workers. The opposition held the protest after the Union government slashed excise duty on petrol and diesel by ₹5 and ₹10 on Diwali-eve.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sukbhir-others-booked-for-trying-to-lay-siege-to-channi-s-residence-101636227688462.html

The decision was taken at the SGPC’s executive committee meeting chaired by its chief Bibi Jagir Kaur in Chandigarh on Saturday.The general house will elect president, senior vice-president, junior vice-president, general secretary, and members of the executive committee at the Teja Singh Samundari Hall, Amritsar.

07-11-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana private sector job quota to kick in from January 15||One year after the state assembly passed it, the BJP-JJP government in Haryana on Saturday ordered that the law providing for 75% reservation for locals in new private sector jobs will come into force from January 15 next year.The state assembly had passed the controversial piece of legislation titled the Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Bill on November 5 last year, and the governor gave assent to the Bill on March 2 this year.The delay in implementation of the law has been on account of framing of the Rules, officials said. The newly-enacted law provided for 75% reservation in private sector jobs to those having a resident certificate (domicile).The law will be applicable for a period of 10 years. The state government had also relaxed the residency (domicile) requirement from 15 to five years for a person to get a bona fide resident certificate in state to provide some flexibility to the private companies in hiring.Salary limit for jobs available reducedIn a measure to placate the industry, the state government on Saturday also reduced the upper limit of gross monthly salary for jobs which will come under the ambit of private sector job quota law. As per a notification, jobs having a gross monthly salary of not more than ₹30,000 will be up for hiring from among local candidates.The Bill passed by the assembly last year had capped the gross monthly wages for jobs available for hiring at ₹50,000.However, following ‘feedback’ from industrial houses and entrepreneurs, the state government decided to reduce the salary cap.More exemptions in the offingIt is learnt that as an industry-friendly measure, companies, firms and establishments which come into being or set up after the commencement of the law will be exempted for a year from hiring 75% local candidates by the state government.Also, any hiring from within (internal hiring) by a company or an establishment will be exempted from the law. These provisions will be a part of the rules being framed under the Act. Officials said the rules for implementing the Act will also notified soon.Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar said the need of the hour is to create a harmonious environment for industry as well as the youth along with creating a right balance between the progress of industries and the economy.‘Law may not pass legal test’Legal experts said the new law is in contravention of the Constitution and will not withstand judicial scrutiny. Former Haryana advocate general Ashok Aggarwal had said domicile can never form the basis of employment.Aggarwal said if public employment cannot be given on the basis of domicile how can private jobs be. The government is not the employer in private sector jobs, he said. He added that only a small percentage of low-end jobs can be reserved and that too for special reasons.While tabling Bill in assembly, the government had modified its Section 23, a provision which gave it an overriding effect over any other law, a broad provision having the potential to be repugnant to an Act of the Parliament. Section 23 in the Bill was modified to provide overriding effect on any other state law.However, issues raised by the law and legislative secretary during vetting of the proposed law still holds good, legal experts said. The clause providing for preference in jobs to the local candidates domiciled in Haryana, experts said, was in contravention of Article 14 of the Constitution pertaining to equality before the law and Article 19 (1)(g) which provides for protection of certain rights to practice any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business.The private sector job quota move was piloted by deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala’s Jannayak Janta Party (JJP), coalition partner of the BJP in Haryana. The controversial piece of legislation did not find much support from the BJP quarters initially. In fact, Khattar had once sounded non-committal on the prospect of enacting such a law.Sources said since the BJP government at the Centre has a different view on the matter, it was surprising how the governor assented to the Bill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-private-sector-job-quota-to-kick-in-from-january-15-101636227148350.html

Without naming Sidhu, Channi said: “Though I belong to a poor family, I am not weak. And whosoever is guilty will be punished.” “All those who pushed the Punjab youth into drugs would not be spared. With the opening of report against the drug mafia, all big sharks would be exposed,” the CM said on the sidelines of the groundbreaking ceremony of a bridge over Sutlej. Reiterating his government’s commitment to stamp out corruption from public life, Channi said every decision is taken for the overall development and prosperity of the state, besides welfare of its people with absolute sincerity and determination. He said clean and transparent administration was exemplified when none of any shopkeeper/vendor was harassed during Diwali for money.Lambasting the Shiromani Akali Dal, Channi said previous SAD-BJP government had always ignored the interests of the state. He also accused the Akalis of conniving with the BJP for indulging in ugly game of politics, thereby fanning hatred by playing caste and religion cards. “Several self-styled common men (aam adami) have surfaced nowadays just for politicking, who are not even remotely connected with the basic problems and needs of the people,” he said. Speaking on the occasion, finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal said Channi can feel the pulse of the poor people because he (Channi) himself had passed through the pangs of penury.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sacrilege-probe-on-right-fast-track-channi-s-retort-to-sidhu-101636226728061.html
07-11-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana woman steals newborn girl from civil hospital, held||An unidentified woman, who abducted a newborn girl from Lord Mahavira Civil Hospital in Ludhiana on Saturday afternoon, was arrested within hours of the incident. The baby’s father, Narinder Kumar of Islamganj, said his wife Rani had delivered a girl 15 days ago at the civil hospital. Both of them had been discharged from the hospital, but his wife developed some complications, after which she was readmitted to the mother-child ward of the hospital on October 27.His mother-in-law who had been attending to her grandchild at the hospital had handed her over the accused woman, while she helped Rani use the washroom. Later, the accused and the baby were nowhere to be found in the mother-child ward, he said. The parents raised the alarm and a police party from Division Number 2 and Division Number 3 reached the spot and scanned CCTV footage, but to no avail. The woman could not be seen exiting the hospital, and the cops believe she fled through the damaged compound wall behind the mortuary. Some CCTV cameras were found to be non-functional. Congress MLA Surinder Dawar also came to the hospital and asked the police to use all resources to trace the missing child.Assistant sub-inspector Rajinderpal Singh, in-charge of the Civil hospital police post, said as per patients the woman appeared to be in her early 40s and was accompanied by a four-year-old boy who had been spotted roaming around the ward since morning. The patients assumed that she had come to visit someone in the ward.In the evening, locals spotted the accused near the hospital with the newborn and alerted the cops. The police arrested the woman and recovered the child. The accused, a resident of Sunet village, said she was being treated at the hospital and had taken away the baby by mistake and had returned to hand over the baby to its parents.Inspector Satpal, Division number 2 station house officer, said the woman has been changing her statements frequently. The police are trying to figure out how the woman, who was accompanied by a four-year-old boy, managed to enter the mother-child ward on the second floor of the hospital, unnoticed by the staff. The father of the newborn has alleged that the staff of the hospital was involved in the crime. History of lapses On February 11, a woman had abducted a newborn girl from the civil hospital after befriending the mother and offering to take the child for a round of the wards. The woman had been arrested seven days after the incident, and the child was also recovered. A similar incidence was reported on September 23, 2017 when a woman posing as an employee of the Khanna civil hospital had stolen a newborn boy from the Civil Hospital in Khanna on the pretext of administering a vaccine. The accused had sent the mother of the child to get something to eat and fled with the child. Hours after the incident, the Khanna police had arrested three women and recovered the newborn.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-woman-steals-newborn-girl-from-civil-hospital-held-101636226668562.html
07-11-2021||Chandigarh||‘Will chop off hands’: BJP MP after Haryana protesters confine Grover||A day after Haryana Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) vice-president and former state minister Manish Grover, BJP general secretary (organisation) Ravindra Raju and other senior leaders of the saffron party were locked up for hours at a temple in Kiloi village in Rohtak, BJP’s Rohtak MP Arvind Sharma on Saturday threatened to chop hands and gouge eyes of anyone who raises a finger at Grover.Sharma led a protest march against leader of Opposition and Congress leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda and his son Deepender Singh Hooda and accused them of backing those who confined the senior BJP leaders at a temple on Friday.“The Congress tried to hold our leaders hostage yesterday. This is frustration of Bhupinder and Deepender for losing the Lok Sabha polls. We won the Rohtak Lok Sabha seat due to Grover. Deepender and Congress should be note that if anyone raises a finger at Grover, we will chop their hands and gouge their eyes,” the MP said.“The days of Hooda family are gone and they are confined in some areas of Rohtak and Jhajjar. Some people of these areas are backing them with a hope that Hooda will become chief minister again. But this is not going to happen because BJP will rule in Haryana for the next 25 years,” the MP added.Addressing the BJP workers, Grover said three youths had barged into the temple at Kiloi village at around 11am when he was listening to the live telecast of PM Narendra Modi’s speech from Kedarnath Temple.“The alcoholic youths said this is Grover, who is responsible for Deepender’s defeat in the Lok Sabha polls and this is the right time to teach him a lesson. My colleagues and party workers asked me to leave the temple as the situation got tense but I refused. With the support of my party workers and Khap representatives, we returned home safely,” he said.“Bhupinder Singh Hooda has been trying to divide the society and he did the same a few years back. Neither had I apologised from anyone nor will I apologise in future. Some people of the Hooda and Nandal Khaps came to me and requested to wish everyone ‘Ram-Ram’ from the balcony and the matter was resolved thereafter,” he added.Reacting to Rohtak MP Arvind Sharma and former minister Manish Grover’s statements, Congress chief whip in Haryana assembly and local MLA BB Batra said the MP’s statement is unacceptable in a democratic setup.“How can an elected MP threaten people to chop their hands? This is clearly a violation of law and order and police should take cognisance of the matter. The BJP leader’s statement shows that they have no faith in democracy. If anyone tried to hold them hostage, they should file a complaint before the police. The BJP leaders want to rule with sticks,” the Rohtak MLA added.While Deepender could not be reached for a comment, Bhupinder Singh Hooda said he did not want to comment on such “irresponsible statements”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/will-chop-off-hands-bjp-mp-after-haryana-protesters-confine-grover-101636225707976.html
07-11-2021||Kolkata||‘Why is he not quitting party?’ Dilip Ghosh’s jibe at Tathagata Roy||Bharatiya Janata Party’s national vice president Dilip Ghosh lashed out at veteran party leader and former Meghalaya Governor Tathagata Roy, asking him to leave if he was upset with the party’s style of functioning. “If he is so upset and ashamed of all that is happening within the party, why is he not quitting the party?” Ghosh said on Saturday before flying to Delhi to attend the party’s central working committee meeting. “You (Tathagata) did nothing for the party in recent times. But the party did everything for people like you,” he added. Roy, however, refused to comment saying that he would not want to attach importance to what Ghosh said. “Ghosh would never understand my reply. It would be a futile effort. Hence I am not giving any importance to this,” Roy tweeted. Ever since the BJP’s debacle in the recently held West Bengal assembly elections, Roy mounted attacks on some senior leaders including Ghosh, Kailash Vijayvargiya, Arvind Menon and Shiv Prakash. “The responsibility for this debacle will rest squarely on the shoulders of KDSA (Kailash Vijayvargiya – Dilip Ghosh – Shiv Prakash and Arvind Menon) team,” Roy tweeted on November 2. The TMC secured a thumping victory in the West Bengal Assembly election held earlier this year, bagging 213 of the 292 seats and stopping the BJP’s tally at 77. Roy, who headed the Bengal unit of the BJP between 2002 and 2006, also courted controversy recently after he tweeted a photo collage of a dog and West Bengal in-charge Kailash Vijayvargiya. BJP state president Sukanta Majumder, however, steered clear of the controversy saying that it was the “prerogative of the central leadership”. Last month, Roy had told reporters that he was ashamed of some top-level leaders as, ahead of the Bengal assembly polls, they were swayed by the glamour factor while inducting people into the BJP and did not take experience and chances of winning into consideration. Recently, Roy retweeted a tweet by a party worker in which the latter said that he was ashamed of a senior party leader for how he was praising a Tollywood actor. Meanwhile, in another setback, actor-turned BJP leader Joy Banerjee sent a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi while hinting that he may join the TMC. “Inspired by Narendra Modi, I joined the BJP on March 6, 2014, but on November 6, 2021, I sent a letter to Modi to quit the party. The BJP is no more connected to the people. I have always worked with people, be it films or politics. Given a chance, I would like to work with the party which is working for the people,” he said. Senior BJP leader Rahul Sinha said that the party has failed to stand beside Banerjee and is gradually losing connect with many other leaders and workers following which they are getting frustrated. “I don’t know the grievances of Banerjee. He was distressed. The party didn’t connect with him and should have stood beside him,” said Sinha. The TMC took a jibe at the BJP saying that no mentally stable person would be able to stay in the BJP and hence leaders are quitting the party. At least five BJP legislators have quit the party to join the TMC since May this year. “No mentally stable person can stay in the BJP. Leaders are quitting the party. Banerjee’s decision didn’t come overnight. He has been raising several issues inside the party over the past many days. The BJP leaders have no faith in the party. If they can’t keep faith how could citizens have faith?” said Kunal Ghosh, TMC spokesperson and party’s state general secretary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/dilip-ghosh-asks-veteran-party-leader-tathagata-roy-to-leave-party-101636225649327.html
07-11-2021||Chandigarh||NAS exam: 210 schools from Ludhiana district to participate||A total of 210 schools from Ludhiana district have been selected to participate in the National Achievement Survey (NAS) examination scheduled for November 12 throughout the country. Students of Classes 3, 5, 8 and 10 from government and private schools will take the exam.According to a senior official, representatives of the central government shortlisted the schools on the basis of a set criteria. As many as 337 field invigilators have been appointed for the exam in Ludhiana, including teachers, lecturers, block mentors, district mentors and representatives from the District Institute of Education and Training (DIET). “There will be two invigilators for Class 3 students and one each for Classes 8 and 10,” an official stated.District education officer Lakhvir Singh Samra on Saturday chaired a meeting with the field invigilators at a KVM senior secondary school here, where the teachers were briefed about their roles.Meanwhile, a special training session was held for the field invigilators, school nodal officers and block nodal officers by Subodh Verma, district mentor for English, Sanjeev Taneja, DM for math and Jasvir Singh, DM for science.“Training was imparted pertaining to OMR sheets, IDs of the students, teachers and other important aspects of exam. The state education department has left no stone unturned to prepare the students and teachers for NAS and we are hopeful of bagging the top spot in the country,” said Samra.The department had also distributed NAS booklets to teachers and students so that they can prepare for the exam. With just five days left for the exams, schools have started revision.However, a few teachers criticised the NAS, terming it a political agenda to woo voters in the state. A teacher, on the condition of anonymity, said, “The mainstream syllabus has been completely neglected. It is a matter of great concern that students in many schools have not got their NCERT textbooks, but they have been bombarded with NAS booklets”.He added that the teachers made mockery of the NAS revision tests, as they fill the OMR sheets themselves to portray excellent results. “There is lot of political pressure on the education secretary to get the top result in NAS, even if teachers have to ignore the mainstream syllabus,”the teacher stated.The newly-appointed Punjab secretary of school education, Ajoy Sharma, had recently had held a special meeting with all district education officers of the state. He asked them to take responsibility for ongoing NAS preparations in the state, following which Ludhiana DEO directed the field teams appointed to check NAS preparations at schools to take their visits seriously.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/nas-exam-210-schools-from-ludhiana-district-to-participate-101636225587858.html

Their indefinite protest outside the United Cycle and Parts Manufacturers Association (UCPMA) office on Gill road entered its fifth day on Saturday.Terming it “Gandhigiri”, they also sought wisdom for everyone including Modi, Shah and the general public by reciting “bhajans”. Seeking the formation of a regulatory commission at the Union level to keep a check on the rising prices, representatives of industrial associations including UCPMA, Knitwear and Textile Club, Federation of Industrial and Commercial Organisation (FICO), Bahadurke Road Textile and Knitwear Association and Bicycle Research And Development Organisation (BRADO) participated in the protest. They said that they will only vote for the party which work to fulfill their demand.The industrialists rued that price of raw material including steel, paint, nickel and fuel are being increased arbitrarily in the country, but the Centre is turning a blind eye towards the problem. Due to this, they are struggling to survive and are forced to hike the prices of their end products. Stating that steel prices have almost doubled in the last two years, they also termed the move to slash fuel prices politically motivated.UCPMA general secretary Manjinder Sachdeva and propaganda secretary Rajinder Sarhali stated that before coming into power, Modi had made tall claims that he can bring inflation under control. But, the government is now turning a blind eye towards the skyrocketing prices.Sachdeva stated that they had also protested on Diwali and Vishwakarma day, as the industry will not be able to survive for long under these circumstances.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhianaindustrialists-take-dig-at-centre-over-rising-prices-of-raw-materials-101636225468947.html

He added that in the coming days, the same project would also be launched at community health centre in Jawaddi and Rural Health Centre in Pohir.He said that the project aims to save precious lives from heart failure by administering the clot-buster drug tenecteplase within the golden period (first 90 minutes) of the onset of symptoms. He said that not everyone cannot afford to buy tenecteplase drug used to dissolve blood clots in the heart because of its high cost (around ₹25,000- ₹30,000) and under the project, it is administered free of cost.Those present on the occasion included councillors Mamta Ashu and Sunny Bhalla, DMCH secretary Prem Gupta, Dr Sandeep Puri, Dr GS Wander and Dr Rajesh Mahajan.33% people confuse heart attack with acidity: ExpertsIn 33% cases, a person who suffers from a heart attack, mistakes the sudden deterioration of health due to acidity and gastric issue, stated senior cardiologist Dr Bishav Mohan.In most cases, people ignore such symptoms. “He added that 95% lives can be saved from the heart attack if the patient receives the treatment within three hours and 80% lives can be protected if the drug is administered within six hours,” said Dr Mohan.He said that erratic lifestyle, pollution, genetic issues, stress, diabetes and obesity are some of the common reasons behind increased the number of heart attacks. “Fortunately, in Punjab, the incidents of heath attacks due to excessive smoking are less, but findings have shown that extreme workout if the body is not accustomed to it and high intake of protein supplements -which also lead to the thickening of blood- have also become the leading causes of heart attack,” said Dr Mohan. He added that ECG is very important to get timely treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-minister-donates-10l-to-icmr-project-to-save-lives-of-heart-attack-patients-101636225288695.html

07-11-2021||Lucknow||UP’s economy near normal now, claims govt||The Uttar Pradesh government on Saturday claimed that the state’s economy was returning to near normal with its total revenue collections going up by ₹997.33 crore for October, year on year. The revenue collected in October 2021 was ₹11,670.12 crore against ₹10,672 crore collected in the same month last year.“The state government’s revenue collections show that the state’s economy, adversely affected by Covid-19, is returning to near normal. Our revenue collections are going up consistently every month now. The relief given by the state government in the VAT on petrol and diesel has been appreciated by all sections of society,” said minister for finance Suresh Khanna while releasing data of revenue collections.A close scrutiny of the revenue collections, however, shows that the state government’s collections of ₹11,670.12 crore in October 2021 were only 81.6% of the target for the month ( ₹14,303.26 crore). The state government’s GST and VAT collections were ₹6,358.76 crore, about 75.4% of the target for the month ( ₹8,431.01 crore). Its excise collections remained ₹2,638.10 crore, about 105.9% of the target of ₹2,490.00 crore.The state government’s collections in the transport sector were only ₹580.32 crore about ₹44 lakh less than ₹580.25 crore collected in the month last year. Collections in the transport sector were 65.3% of target for the month ( ₹888.25 crore). The non-tax collection was also down from ₹284.77 crore in October 2020 to ₹224.42 crore in the same month in 2021, about 49.9% of the target of ₹450 crore.The state government’s total tax collections in 2021-2022 (April 1 to October 31, 2021) were ₹77,655.04 crore, about 74.8% of the target of ₹1,03,833.25 crore for the same period. Its total tax collections in the first seven months of 2021-2022 were only 41.7% of the annual target of ₹1,86,345.00 crore.“Although the state government’s revenue is rising there are areas of concern, which include the transport sector. This shows that the automobile sector is not doing so well in the state. Another area of concern is non-tax revenue. The state government will therefore have to pay more attention to areas of concern,” said Professor Yashvir Tyagi, former head of department, economics, Lucknow University.“The relief given in the VAT recently will also have an impact on the state government’s revenue in months to come. The state government should therefore make efforts to augment revenue in coming months,” Tyagi further said.The state will go into poll mode for 2022 assembly elections. The state government proposes to present a vote on account for the first few months of 2022-2023 in the state legislature. As the state government will not be able to mobilise additional resources to augment revenue, it will have to keep a close watch on revenue recovery under various heads in the coming months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/ups-economy-near-normal-now-claims-govt-101636223428867.html

Dr Rajesh Chawla, senior consultant of pulmonary and critical care at Indraprastha Apollo hospital, said, “There has been nearly 20% increase in the number of patients coming in with exacerbations of their chronic respiratory conditions since Diwali.” A study by the All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS), for which data was collected between 2017 and 2019, shows that even on “good” air days, small increases in pollution levels sends more people to the emergency department. The study found that there is a nearly 20% increase in the number of patients who need emergency care when PM2.5 level is recorded between 50 and 100µg/m³. At its peak – between October and January –hospitalisations go up by 40%. The high pollution levels are likely to impact more people this year as a significant proportion of people who recovered from Covid-19 might not have completely healthy lungs, Dr Chawla added. “People who had severe Covid-19, especially those who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), will definitely suffer more due to the pollution. Some are likely to see asthma-like bronchial hyper reactivity. Nearly 20 to 30% of the post-Covid-19 patients will suffer the effects. And this will not just be limited to this year but in the time to come as well. The impact [of pollution] will be more in patients with low lung efficiency,” he said.Dr Nayar said, “The lungs of several Covid-19 patients might not have recovered fully. Exposing them to high levels of pollution is like hitting someone on an existing wound. In fact, I have seen several Covid-19 recovered patients who were fine till last month but have started experiencing some symptoms since.”Over 1.4 million people have had the infection in Delhi so far, according to official data. Several global studies have already shown that people living in areas with high levels of pollution are more likely to die of Covid-19 – such as the study that reported 12% mortality in Northern Italy where pollution levels are higher in comparison to 4.5% from other parts of the country. A study from the Harvard University has also shown that with every 1 μg increase in PM 2.5 long term exposure, Covid-19 mortality went up by 8%. “Both Covid-19 and pollution primarily affects the lungs. High levels of pollution may result in chronic conditions that predispose people to severe Covid-19; lungs damaged by severe Covid-19 are more likely to be affected by pollution. Just like every year, we have started seeing an increase in patients coming in with shortness of breath, cough, wheezing, chest pain, and sputum as soon as the pollution levels went up,” said Dr BK Tripathi, professor in the department of medicine at Safdarjung hospital. Senior officials of Delhi’s environment department said that the government started issuing regular health advisories in 2016 after the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in a 2015 order asked the Delhi government to identify pollution hot spots and define the health impact that residents of those areas could face because of prolonged exposure to toxic air.“The health impacts are definitely critical and for a healthy human being these impacts might not be seen immediately, but for the more vulnerable sections such as people with chronic ailments, children and senior citizens exposure to such high levels of poisonous air can be a problem. With Covid-19, these risks are much higher,” a senior environment department official said. According to the Central Pollution Control Board’s daily health advisories, only ‘good’ air days as per Indian air quality standards (AQI in 0-50 range) results in “minimal health impact” in people. As the AQI levels start rising to the ‘satisfactory’ (AQI in 51-100 range), “minor breathing discomfort” could be visible among “sensitive people. In the ‘moderate’ AQI range, the air quality monitoring body warns that signs of “breathing difficulty could be seen among people with lung problems, asthma and heart diseases”, with prolonged exposure to ‘poor’ air (AQI between 101 and 150), breathing discomfort might be experienced among “most people”. The CPCB advisories also say that in ‘very poor’ and ‘severe’ AQI range — usually recorded in the national capital during winter, when frigid conditions coupled with external and local pollution start worsening the city’s air quality — residents can experience respiratory illnesses and serious health impacts to those with existing diseases. Before the NGT order, CPCB conducted a comprehensive study in 2008, which identified a significant association of pollution with adverse health outcomes. It was found that residents in Delhi had a 1.7 times higher prevalence of respiratory symptoms as compared to someone living in a rural area. The findings also showed that lung function was reduced in 40.3% of individuals in Delhi as compared to those in rural areas. Bhavreen Kandhari, environmental activist and co-founder of Warrior Moms, a group of women fighting air pollution in India, said, “My daughters live with a very high risk of developing respiratory infections that stem from Delhi’s excessively polluted air. For children to have the lungs of a smoker by their teens, through no fault of their own, just by breathing air is absolutely unacceptable. We need governments to listen to us. Keep our children safe.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/pollution-impact-after-diwali-delhi-doctors-report-spike-in-breathing-trouble-101636223369217.html

In it, he is heard threatening employees for opening the eatery, which sells non-vegetarian food, on Diwali.HT could not independently verify the authenticity of the video but the owner of the eatery, Makrub Alam, said the video was recorded at his shop. Other shopkeepers stepped in, after which the man fled, said Alam.“He seemed drunk. There were three people inside my shop. Around 7.30pm, he came and threatened us for opening the shop on Diwali day. He claimed to be from a right-wing group. All our Hindu brothers (other shopkeepers) came to the shop and defended me. They scolded that man, after which he fled. I did not want the issue to be blown out of proportion and shut my shop that evening. It is open now. We had not seen him before and have not seen him after that evening,” said Alam. He said the man recorded the video himself.Police said they had not received any distress call and were not informed of the incident, but filed a case suo motu on Friday, after the video went viral. “He [the man in the video] is not from our area,” said Alam. “He must have posted it on social media. On Friday, the station house officer of the local station visited me and started the probe. He said the police would register a case and find that man,” he added. Deputy commissioner of police (north) Sagar Singh Kalsi said, “We have registered a case under IPC Section 285A. The probe is on.” Alam said he has run the shop for six years, and had never been harassed before. “We did not call the police initially because the market association dealt with him at the spot,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/man-forces-biryani-seller-in-delhi-to-shut-shop-on-diwali-police-file-case-101636223367747.html
07-11-2021||Delhi||CBSE issues guidelines for classes 10 and 12 Term-1 exams in the OMR format||In order to help Class 10 and 12 students who will be appearing for their board exams using the optical mark recognition (OMR) sheets for the first time, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) on Saturday shared information on the new mode of assessment and also issued a set of dos and don’ts for students.Keeping in view the unprecedented scenario arising out of Covid-19 pandemic, the CBSE, earlier this year, announced that it would conduct the board examinations in two parts this year. The format for the Term-1 examinations will be objective, multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and the exams will begin for Class 10 on November 30 and for Class 12 on December 1. There are over 2,100 CBSE-affiliated schools in Delhi.According to the circular issued to principals on Saturday, the details of the candidate will come filled on the OMR sheets. “The candidate has to write a question paper code in the upper right corner in the space provided for the same. Question paper code will be written on the question paper…Only blue/black ballpoint pens are to be used for filling in the desired information and for giving responses...Use of pencils is strictly prohibited,” the CBSE said in the circular, adding that in case candidates used pencils for filling the OMR sheets, that will be deemed as “use of unfair means” and action will be taken against the student(s) accordingly.The board further said, “For giving a response, 4 circles — a, b, c, and d — are given next to each question in a row. Candidates once confident about the correctness of reply should darken the (appropriate) circle with a pen. After four circles are over, a box is given in the same row. Candidates have to write the correct option in that box — a, b, c or d — whichever the answer is.”If the box is empty and the response is marked only in the circle, the board said it will be deemed that the “question was not been attempted” by the student. However, if the response is given in the box and the circle is left blank, it will be deemed that the “question has been attempted”. If the circle, box, and the last circle for the question number are all left blank, it will be considered that the “question has not been attempted”.“Schools are requested that based on the information provided by the CBSE, practise sessions be organised for students. Prior to the practise sessions, teachers must also get well acquainted with the OMR sheets,” controller of examination Sanyam Bhardwaj said.The duration of the examination will be 90 minutes and it will cover only the rationalised syllabus of Term-1. The question papers will be sent by the CBSE to schools along with the marking scheme, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/cbse-issues-guidelines-for-classes-10-and-12-term-1-exams-in-the-omr-format-101636215806347.html

In view of this, this policy has been brought forth so that the people of Delhi can be saved from the possible danger to life and property that bare conductors pose,” Kejriwal said.The government said about 2,264km of bare conductor network will be converted into an insulated network by the three discoms Tata Power Delhi Distribution Limited (TPDDL), BSES Yamuna Power Limited (BYPL) and BSES Rajdhani Power Limited (BRPL). Kejriwal said the government is also working on shifting all overhead electrical wires underground. “The power department at present has a policy on shifting high tension (11KV, 33KV and 66KV) and low tension (400V) power transmission lines which are life threatening. This was approved by the Delhi cabinet in August 2018. On the lines of the policy of shifting HT and LT lines approved by the Delhi cabinet, the electricity department has prepared a draft policy for conversion of 11 kV bare conductors to insulated conductors,” the statement said.Of the 2,264km of wires, TPDDL will convert 1,270km, BYPL will convert 29km and BRPL will convert 965km of bare wires into an insulated network.The finance department has given ₹25 crore to the power department in financial year 2021-22 for the project under the ”Jagmagaati Delhi (shining Delhi)” programme.The conversion will be undertaken in areas including regularised unauthorised colonies, urbanised villages and resettlement colonies or colonies established under a 20 point programme in rural areas; or rural areas such as Lal Dora and extended Lal Dora.“Unauthorised colonies with name and registration number and Khasra number of the respective revenue village or area through which the 11 kV bare conductor is passing, have also been included,” the statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-cabinet-approves-policy-to-insulate-bare-electricity-wires-101636215566230.html
07-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt orders probe after collapse at Green Park multilevel car parking||The state government has ordered an inquiry into the collapse at an automated car parking facility in south Delhi’s Green Park on Tuesday, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said on Saturday. Addressing a press conference, Sisodia said the Delhi government has asked the director of local bodies of the state urban development department to investigate the incident through the public works department (PWD). “The Kejriwal government will not tolerate any wastage of taxpayers’ money and negligence in public security. Taking serious cognisance of the matter, I have ordered the director of local bodies to conduct an investigation through the PWD and submit a report within 15 days. This is to ensure that the lapses are identified and action is taken against the culprits,” he said. Four platforms in the city’s first automated parking lot at Green Park allegedly malfunctioned due to a technical fault during a maintenance operation around 5.30pm on Tuesday, damaging at least two vehicles. The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) said its technical team repaired the glitches on Wednesday. South Delhi mayor Mukesh Suryan said he already has ordered a probe to investigate the causes of the malfunction, adding that the private company operating the facility will be blacklisted if found to be at fault for the collapse. On Saturday, Sisodia alleged that the SDMC collected “huge sums” from shopkeepers near the facility on the pretext of parking conversion charges to build the structure. “Shops were sealed and the parking space was constructed. But within a year, the parking space was mired in corruption allegations and began to collapse, resulting in damage to several cars,” he said. The deputy chief minister criticised the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) handling of the three municipal corporations in Delhi and failing to “end corruption” in them. Civic body elections in Delhi are scheduled to take place early next year. “Electric floor plates have started to fall apart inside the parking lot, damaging many cars. Several people have suffered heavy losses, as a result. Fortunately, nobody was harmed. It is obvious that the facility could not last even a year because of BJP’s rigging and corruption,” Sisodia said. Spokespersons of the Delhi BJP did not respond to requests for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-orders-inquiry-into-platform-collapse-at-green-park-multilevel-car-parking-101636215266026.html
07-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt extends free ration scheme by six months, urges Centre to do so too||New Delhi: The state government will distribute free, additional ration to lower-income group residents of the city for another six months, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Saturday, adding that he wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and urged him to extend the Centre’s free ration scheme for the same period. “The Delhi government is extending its free ration scheme to the poor for six months. I urged the Central government to also extend its ration scheme for six months by writing a letter to the Prime Minister. People are in a lot of trouble right now. It would not be right to let go of their hand at this juncture,” Kejriwal said in a statement on Saturday. The move came a day after Union food secretary Sudhanshu Pande said the Centre was not planning to extend beyond November 30 the free ration scheme, which was launched as a social net for the poor during the coronavirus pandemic.The Delhi government in a Cabinet meeting chaired by Kejriwal in May last year decided to give extra free ration to the needy. According to the eligibility prescribed under the National Food Security Act (NFSA, 5kg of food grains are distributed to residents from lower-income groups, including migrant workers, unorganised workers, construction workers, domestic helpers and those who do not have ration cards. This includes 4kg of wheat and 1kg of rice per person per month. Since then, about two million people in Delhi have received rations as part of this programme. Kejriwal in his letter to the PM wrote that during Covid-19, the central government had given free ration to every cardholder across the country in addition to the ration being made available every month. “The Delhi government made the monthly ration supply free from its own end… Due to these steps by the central government and Delhi government, the poor got a lot of relief during the pandemic. These schemes by both governments are ending in November. The central government has announced that this scheme will not be extended after November,” he said in the letter.He added, “There is backbreaking inflation in the country at this time. The common man is finding it difficult to get two square meals. Many people lost their jobs during the Corona period. They have no means of earning. In such a situation, I request you that the Central Government further extend this scheme of giving additional free ration to the people for six more months. The Delhi Government is extending the scheme from its own end to provide people free additional ration for six months. It will be very kind of you to do the same as well.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-extends-free-ration-scheme-by-six-months-urges-centre-to-do-so-too-101636214906049.html

The six-member team is headed by the NCB’s deputy director general Sanjay Singh. NCB chief SN Pradhan on Friday issued an order transferring the six cases from NCB’s Mumbai zonal unit to the operations branch from its headquarters. The SIT was constituted to take over from NCB Mumbai zonal unit six cases in order to conduct deeper investigation, to find out forward and backward linkages, NCB said in a release on Friday. “We have taken over six cases as per procedure. There is nothing to say as of now,” Singh said in Mumbai. When asked about Wankhede, he replied, “Wankhede continues to be the zonal director, Mumbai and we will definitely take his help in the investigation.” The SIT will start investigating the cruise drugs case from where point where actor Ananya Panday was questioned on October 25, an NCB officer said. The list of the six cases also includes the drugs case against Sameer Khan, son-in-law of Maharashtra cabinet minister and Nationalist Congress Party leader Nawab Malik. Khan was arrested by NCB in first of week January 2021 and was released on bail on September 28. The SIT will also probe the case involving actor Armaan Kohli. An NCB team led by Wankhede had raided Kohli’s Juhu residence on August 28 and recovered a small quantity of cocaine. Kohli was arrested on September 29, and continues to be behind bars. A fourth case to be probed by the SIT was registered by the agency’s Mumbai zonal unit on July 25 when it arrested three persons – Sameer Mukhtar Sayyed alias Sam Langda, Zakir Sayyed alias Zakir Takla alias Zakir Chikna and Mohammad Amed Shamsuddin Shaikh and allegedly seized 1.2kg of charas, an intermediate quantity of mephedrone along with ₹17.5 lakh in cash from them. NCB claimed that Sameer Merchant alias Sam Langda was a notorious, organised drug mafia member. The fifth case on the list was registered in September when NCB recovered an intermediate quantity of mephedrone, whereas the sixth case related to the recovery of mephedrone from Dongri area in south Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/delhi-ncb-team-in-city-to-take-over-aryan-case-101636214426819.html

This was a much-awaited decision as the US authorities have been buying time to finally open the country for foreign travellers. The restrictions stopped many Indians living in the US from coming to India as they would have been stuck in India with the US not allowing Indian travellers so far.The restriction was imposed by then President Donald Trump in early 2020 when the pandemic just started and is finally being withdrawn after the world valiantly fought multiple waves of the pandemic.Here is all you need to know1. Only fully vaccinated travellers will be allowed to travel to the United States.2. Still, the travellers will have to carry proof of negative coronavirus test before boarding the flight.3. Passengers will need to show their vaccination status to the airlines which will match the name and the date of birth to confirm that no one can carry someone else's vaccination certificate.4. All FDA- and WHO-approved vaccines are recognised by the US authorities. And this includes India's indigenous vaccine Covaxin as the vaccine has been given emergency use approval by the WHO.5. The US will also reopen its land borders with Canada and Mexico for vaccinated people.6. Allowing only fully vaccinated travellers are almost like issuing a vaccine passport and the condition will leave out people of many countries. The government said it will consider passengers from those countries if there is a humanitarian or emergency reason.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-allow-vaccinated-foreign-travellers-from-november-8-covaxin-allowed-101636304700351.html

The CIA revelations show the lengths some agencies are willing to go to in their persecution of Julian," Moris was quoted as saying by the daily.Assange and Moris have been engaged for five years and have two children together. They have asked for assistance in arranging the marriage in May, when the whistleblower was already in jail awaiting extradition appeal trial, the newspaper said. However, the process stalled and Assange applied for official permission directly with the Belmarsh chief on October 7, to no effect. The couple's lawyers also reportedly failed to get a response from the prison authorities.The lawsuit accuses Raab and Belmarsh Governor Jenny Louis of abusing their power over Assange, behaving irrationally and unfairly, and denying the couple and their children their human rights, the Daily Mail said.The accused have until November 12 to respond.Assange was arrested in London on April 11, 2019, and sentenced to 50 weeks in prison for jumping bail in 2012. He took refuge inside the Ecuadorean embassy in the UK capital to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he was facing sexual assault charges that were later dropped by a Swedish court.Assange is wanted by the United States on espionage charges after WikiLeaks published thousands of classified documents that shed light on war crimes committed by American troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. If put on trial and convicted in the US, the whistleblower faces up to 175 years in prison.In September, it was revealed that senior US officials and the CIA were allegedly discussing the possibility of kidnapping and killing Assange in 2017 while he was hiding in the Ecuadorian embassy in London.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/julian-assange-fiancee-file-lawsuit-against-uk-minister-prison-for-preventing-their-marriage-101636301611895.html

By the mid-year mark, nearly half of the population – some 18.4 million people – were already in need of humanitarian and protection assistance in 2021,” the report further noted.Also read | From November 8, Afghanistan to begin nationwide polio vaccination campaignMeanwhile, the spokesperson for UN secretary-general pointed to reports that showed isolated clashes and violence affecting civilians and resulting in casualties continued across the war-torn country this week, according to a report by news agency ANI.Further, the report also said that issues related to food security were driven largely due to drought and even after the harvest, as much as 57% of the households did not have food reserves to last for three months.Also, the situation is expected to deteriorate in 10 out of the 11 most populated urban areas, the report said. “In urban areas, income loss (driven by economic shocks) has contributed to the rapid deterioration in food insecurity,” the report showed.“No population group had a net positive income in 2021. Assessments show that more households have higher than average debt this year. This is increasingly concerning as food basket costs are steadily rising, constituting more than 82 per cent of the average HH income,” it further said.Earlier in October, a report released by the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the UN World Food Programme (WFP) echoed similar alarming forecasts for the country.“The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) report has found that more than one in two Afghans will be facing crisis (IPC Phase 3) or emergency (IPC Phase 4) levels of acute food insecurity through the November 2021 to March 2022 lean season, requiring urgent humanitarian interventions to meet basic food needs, protect livelihoods and prevent a humanitarian catastrophe,” the FAO had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nearly-55-of-afghan-population-expected-to-face-food-insecurity-from-nov-2021-to-mar-2022-says-un-report-101636297874910.html

07-11-2021||World||Sudan security fires tear gas on anti-coup protesters||Sudanese security forces on Sunday fired tear gas at an anti-coup rally by teachers at the start of a two-day civil disobedience call against last month's military takeover.Dozens of teachers carried banners reading "no, no to military rule" and demanded a transition to "full civilian rule" at a rally outside the education ministry in the capital Khartoum.Nationwide anti-coup protests -- including by tens of thousands on October 30 -- have occurred since the October 25 coup but have been met by a deadly crackdown. At least 14 demonstrators have been killed and about 300 wounded, according to the independent Central Committee of Sudan's Doctors."We organised a silent stand against the decisions by Burhan outside the ministry of education," said Mohamed al-Amin, a geography teacher who took part in that protest against the country's top general, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan."Police later came and fired tear gas at us though we were simply standing on the streets and carrying banners," he said.There were no confirmed reports of casualties but about 87 teachers have been detained, according to the Sudanese Professionals Association, an umbrella of unions which called for the Sunday-Monday civil disobedience.The teachers' rally came after the military leadership which carried out the coup replaced heads of department at the education ministry, as part of sweeping changes it made in multiple sectors."The protest rejects the return of remnants of the old regime" linked to ousted president Omar al-Bashir, the teachers' union said in a Facebook post.Sunday's rally followed calls for civil disobedience made by SPA, an umbrella of unions which were instrumental in the 2018-2019 protests which led to the ouster of longtime strongman Bashir in April 2019."The Sudanese people have rejected the military coup," the SPA said on Twitter, vowing "no negotiation, no partnership, no legitimacy"."We will start by barricading the main streets to prepare for the mass civil disobedience on Sunday and Monday," it said, urging protesters to avoid confrontation with the security forces.In the overnight darkness into Sunday protesters were seen piling up bricks and large slabs to block streets in Khartoum and neighbouring cities, according to witnesses and AFP correspondents.Text messagesThe SPA circulated its latest appeals via text messages to bypass internet outages since the putsch."Movement on the streets is less than usual but there is not full blockage of streets or closure of shops" after the civil disobedience call, said a witness from Omdurman who declined to give his name fearing reprisals.On Sunday there appeared to be mixed compliance with the call among retailers. Some shops were still open but others were shuttered in Khartoum and its twin cities of Omdurman and Khartoum-North, according to witnesses.The latest resistance effort came almost two weeks after Burhan dissolved the government as well as the ruling joint military-civilian Sovereign Council that was supposed to lead the country toward full civilian rule.Burhan also declared a state of emergency and detained Sudan's civilian leadership.Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok was briefly detained but later placed under effective house arrest.On Thursday, the military released four civilian members of his government. Others are still held and, on that same day, security forces arrested other civilian leaders near a United Nations building in Khartoum following their meeting with UN Special Representative for Sudan Volker Perthes."We call upon the military leadership to cease arresting politicians and activists and to stop committing human rights violations," Perthes said in a statement on Friday.The military takeover sparked international condemnation, including punitive aid cuts and demands for a swift return to civilian rule.Burhan insists it "was not a coup" but a move to "rectify the course of the transition."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sudan-security-fires-tear-gas-on-anti-coup-protesters-101636291699862.html

The Lahore high court set aside their conviction on Saturday and acquitted all six men, with an unnamed court official telling PTI news agency that the prosecution had failed to prove the charge against the men beyond any reasonable doubt. The court also observed that the statement of the prosecution’s star witness was not reliable as “there is no corroboratory evidence”.In a statement issued at the conclusion of its plenary meeting, FATF had called on Pakistan to address as soon as possible the sole remaining item in its 27-point action plan to counter terror financing by “continuing to demonstrate that [terror financing] investigations and prosecutions target senior leaders and commanders of UN-designated terrorist groups”.FATF president Marcus Pleyer had also said Pakistan has taken several important steps but still needs to demonstrate that probes and prosecutions are being pursued against the senior leadership of UN-designated terror groups. Zafar Iqbal, a senior leader and co-founder of LeT, was designated by the UN Security Council in 2012 for being in-charge of the terror group’s finance department. The listing said Iqbal had travelled to Saudi Arabia with Saeed in 1989-1990 to request financial support from slain al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden.Yahya Mujahid, a spokesperson for JuD, was listed by the UN Security Council in 2009 for his links with al-Qaeda, bin Laden and the Taliban, and for his role in financing, planning and facilitating the activities of LeT. Abdul Rahman Makki has been listed as a “specially designated national” by the US treasury department for his role as the second in command of LeT. The US has also offered a $2-million bounty for Makki.People familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity that Pakistan often arrests and charges leaders of terror groups such as LeT ahead of meetings of FATF to create the impression that it is cracking down on terror. Often, investigations in such cases are not thorough and cases are rushed through the lower courts, the people said.Pakistan was added to FATF’s grey list in mid-2018 and given the 27-point action plan to control money laundering and terror financing. In June this year, FATF asked Pakistan to implement another seven-point action plan to address serious deficiencies related to money laundering.Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said, “Basically, Pakistan has done this sort of thing time and again. In the aftermath of the 2008 Mumbai attacks that were carried out by LeT, the initial dossier compiled by Pakistan’s Federal Investigation Agency showed the lackadaisical attitude towards investigations and collection of evidence.”He added, “Pakistan indicted only LeT operations commander Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi but not the other key players in the Mumbai attacks. After every terror attack that comes in for global scrutiny, they engage in the facade of arresting some suspects, and once the pressure eases, it’s back to business as usual.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-court-acquits-let-jud-leaders-despite-fatf-s-call-for-targeting-terror-groups-101636292270895.html

Sydney also saw hundreds of protesters marching with slogans like “Your Body Your Choice”, another news outlet Sydney Morning Herald reported.The protests were aimed at Australian state Victoria’s premier Daniel Andrews who also introduced the Pandemic Management Bill which will allow the premier of the state to declare a pandemic and extend it in three-month blocks. The bill also allows the Australian health minister to enforce public health orders with much freedom.Protesters in Australia carried placards with phrases like "free Victoria" and "sack Dan Andrews" in Melbourne as they marched towards the Parliament House expressing their opposition to the mandatory vaccination rule as well as the bill. A report from Sky Australia said that Andrews said that citizens of Victoria who remain uninoculated will be subject to Covid-19 restrictions in 2022 as well.The polls conducted by media outlets however show that anti-vaxxers in Australia are much smaller compared to the people who would get vaccinated.Where else in the world are people protesting vaccine mandates?Several Western nations have seen protests against mandatory Covid-19 vaccinations with the US seeing large scale protests among others as the Biden administration recently asked large companies to mandate that their workers get vaccinated against Covid-19 or submit to regular testing.The Republican attorney generals in Texas, Florida, Missouri and 23 other states have sued to block the rule proposed by the Biden administration.France, which has a Covid pass rule, managed to extend the rule which allows the government to make use of the pass till July next year. The system is one of the strictest in Europe, reports news agency AFP, but the protests against the rule which were a weekly occurrence until recently have diminished recently.(with inputs from ANI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccine-mandate-protesters-in-australia-s-major-cities-take-to-the-streets-101636290301356.html

The vaccination campaign in the war-ravaged country was announced by the United Nations in October.“Without any doubt polio is a disease that without treatment will either kill our children or cause them with permanent disability, so in this case the only way is to implement the vaccination,” Dr Qalandar Ebad, the Taliban's acting health minister said, according to the Associated Press.Before taking over Afghanistan in August, the Taliban for the last three years had banned the UN for carrying out polio eradication drives in parts of the country that were under their control.The Taliban were suspicious that members of the vaccination teams could be spies for the previous governments or the West, the Associated Press further reported.Meanwhile, in other areas in Afghanistan, the vaccination campaign was out of the question due to infighting between previous government and insurgents along with fears of roadside bombs and kidnappings.Since 2018, around 3.3 million children have not been vaccinated against polio because of the Taliban's ban."To eliminate polio completely, every child in every household across Afghanistan must be vaccinated, and with our partners, this is what we are setting out to do," Hervé Ludovic De Lys, Unicef Representative in Afghanistan, said in a statement last month.The target population for the four-day vaccination campaign in Afghanistan is 10 million children below the age of five, which also includes the above 3.3 million who did not receive the jab.Polio, a life-threatening disease which is transmitted through contaminated water or food, or in contact with an infected person, has been virtually eradicated globally except for Afghanistan and some parts of Pakistan.Dr Nek Wali Shah Momin, a health ministry official in the polio eradication department, told the Associated Press that the vaccination drive in Afghanistan is a gigantic task and urged for the support of all lined departments.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/from-november-8-afghanistan-to-begin-nationwide-polio-vaccination-campaign-101636285566792.html

07-11-2021||World||Canada: National Hockey League team dons Diwali-themed jerseys||In a first, players from a major North American sports franchise donned Diwali-themed jerseys designed by an Indo-Canadian artist.The commemorative jerseys were commissioned by the Vancouver Canucks of the National Hockey League (NHL) from artist Jagandeep ‘Jag’ Nagra, who is based in the town of Pitt Meadows in British Columbia. They were worn during warmups prior to their game against the Nashville Predators on Friday night.Nagra was elated at Diwali being marked at such a platform, as she said the “atmosphere (at the arena) was amazing”. The jerseys could not be worn during the game itself due to NHL rules for standard uniforms. But an auction following the game, saw one being snapped up for as much as almost 5,000 Canadian dollars ( ₹3 lakh).And the initiative captured eyeballs worldwide. Reacting to a report, actor-director Seth Rogen tweeted, “Will trade a vase for one of these!” and exchange direct messages with Nagra on Twitter. As it was later featured on ESPN’s SportsCenter, singer-songwriter Nick Jonas tweeted, “So cool.” Cabinet minister Harjit Sajjan also thanked Nagra.Nagra, who was born in Surrey in BC, and has roots in the Jalandhar area in Punjab, was thrilled as she watched her design on the rink: “Honestly, I was holding back tears the whole time. This was the biggest sense of pride I had felt. It was really an amazing moment,” she told the Hindustan Times.For the design of the crests for the jerseys, Nagra used motifs associated with Diwali, like mustard oil, often used for traditional lamps, as well as diyas, a lotus, and stars, to create a sense of twinkling lights at dusk. And, of course, an ice hockey stick. In a release, the team said the design for these custom-made jerseys “honours elements of both Diwali and the Vancouver Canucks brand”.As she said, “I wanted to include icons that to me represented Diwali.”They also featured Diwali-coloured name bars in Hindi and Punjabi.Of course, the jerseys matched the occasion as this was also the fifth ‘Diwali night’ being celebrated by the Vancouver Canucks.The team may have lost the game on Friday night, but the project came out a winner, with partial proceeds from the sale of the jerseys going towards rejuvenation of the iconic Punjabi Market in Vancouver, which is over 50-years-old, but has become run down in recent years. That pleased Nagra even more as she also serves as the creative director of the Punjabi Market Regeneration Collective.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-national-hockey-league-team-dons-diwali-themed-jerseys-101636283566797.html

The Taliban also reportedly want to bolster inventory and skillset among its ranks, said the report further."We are trying to use the previous government's air force - the professionals that they had - and make sure they all return. The best policy for us is - whatever department is needed; we are going to have it," ANI quoted a spokesperson for the Taliban's Ministry of the Interior, Qari Saeed Khosty, as saying. "No doubt, a full air force will be built soon - once the regime is fully established. It is not fully established yet," another person familiar with the development was quoted as saying by ANI.Recently, three Taliban-piloted helicopters including a US Black Hawk deployed a quick reaction force at Kubal's main military hospital Sardar Dawood Khan during a suspected ISIS-K attack.Before the Taliban seized Kabul, the Afghan Air force had more than 200 aircraft that included 167 planes, according to the June 2021 assessment by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction.However, it is still unclear that how much of the equipment that the Taliban captured from the Afghan Air Force is operable. An insider said that the main focus of the Taliban is to use the aircraft only in urgent situations and not "not to waste resources", said the ANI report, citing knewz.The Taliban had captured nine major airbases across the country including the strategic provinces of Khost, Kunduz, Mazar-e-Sharif, and Herat.According to the ANI report, the Taliban top leadership said that they are determined to become a "self-sufficient" force in view of the economic crisis gripping the country after the international community freezed the financial aid to the war-torn country.The spokesperson for the Ministry of Defense, Enayatullah Khwaraizmi, also highlighted that it is vital for the new Afghan military to be "fully independent" and said that the external cooperation policies will still be determined by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said the ANI report further, citing knewz.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-express-their-intention-to-build-their-own-air-force-in-afghanistan-101636276230161.html

The apex court also ordered the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provincial government in October 2021 to recover ₹33 million (USD 1,94,161) from the culprits involved in vandalising the century-old shrine.In December last year, over 1,000 people led by some local clerics belonging to the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam Fazl (JUI-F) instigated the villagers to demolish the temple and as a result, people led by local seminary students attacked the temple.The Supreme Court was informed that 109 people involved in the incident had been arrested.Earlier in 1997, the shrine was first attacked and severely damaged, and the PHC head Vankwani had approached the apex court in 2015 seeking help to restore the holy place and restart the annual pilgrimage to the place.“At that time, local clerics were creating hurdles to holding a religious congregation for the Hindus, while the followers of Shri Paramhans Ji tried to build the temple at the place but it was not allowed,” Vankwani had told Dawn.After the Supreme Court issued directives to the provincial government to restore and preserve the Teri temple, the Pakistan Hindu Council started holding the annual fair in 2015.Since the temple is being managed by the local Hindu families, it comes administratively under the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province government and not under the ETPB control, according to the report.Hindus form the biggest minority community in Pakistan.According to official estimates, 75 lakh Hindus live in Pakistan. However, according to the community, over 90 lakh Hindus are living in the country.The majority of Pakistan's Hindu population is settled in Sindh province where they share culture, traditions and language with Muslim residents. They often complain of harassment by the extremists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-hindu-council-to-celebrate-diwali-at-teri-temple-which-was-attacked-in-2020-101636276871289.html

Amirabdollahian told Wang that Iran is committed to the talks on reviving nuclear agreement and is willing to step up coordination with China on the matter.Iran last week announced the resumption of multi-party nuclear talks that have been stalled for months. The negotiations are aimed at restoring the beleaguered 2015 atomic deal that former US President Donald Trump exited more than three years ago. The nuclear agreement, which the Trump administration quit in 2018 to reimpose sanctions, gave international monitors unprecedented access to Iranian nuclear facilities. However, many of those powers have been suspended since February, eroding international oversight on the program. Iran denies its nuclear program has a military component, but distrust of that claim led world powers to seek the 2015 deal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/united-states-should-rectify-its-nuclear-moves-china-tells-iran-101636274903344.html

There were 2,928 infections from the local community and 102 from dormitories for migrant workers as well as five infections who arrived from abroad, according to a report by the Channel News Asia.As of Saturday, Singapore has reported 215,780 COVID-19 cases since the start of the pandemic and 480 deaths.In its efforts to boost hospital capacities, Singapore has converted the F1 Pit Building used for Grand Prix races into a 721-bed COVID-19 treatment facility, the Channel reported.Starting Tuesday, the facility will only take in elderly patients, those who are unvaccinated and above 70 years old or vaccinated and above 80 years old.Patients will be admitted after being assessed by hospitals and they will be monitored by medical staff round the clock. They will have to be generally well and should also be independent.To be discharged from the facility, vaccinated patients will have to clear a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) swab test on Day 6 from when they were confirmed to have COVID-19. Unvaccinated patients will need to test negative on Day 10.If they test positive, vaccinated and unvaccinated patients will be discharged on Day 10 and Day 14 respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-records-3-035-covid-cases-reports-rare-virus-mis-c-among-children-101636274639842.html
07-11-2021||World||The Pakistan factor: Why India, China ties remain challenging since 1971||China is marking its 50th year at the United Nations amid much fanfare with President Xi Jinping saying the decision to “recognise the representatives of the government of the People’s Republic of China (PRC as the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations ... was a victory for the Chinese people and a victory for people of the world”.India, as it turns out, was among the first countries to congratulate China when it became a UN member on October 25, 1971, even calling the absence of the east Asian country from the international body a “perverse mistake”.After Beijing’s UN entry, India and China, however, almost immediately fell out at the global forum over the India-Pakistan war and the formation of Bangladesh in 1971.Barely five weeks into the UN, in its first intervention at the UN Security Council, China lashed out at India for sending troops into then east Pakistan, literally calling it a “gangster” and “fascist” for doing so.China also strongly criticised the USSR for supporting India, and this might be difficult to believe now, said “…the Soviet government is the boss behind the Indian aggressors”.Beijing’s full-fledged support for Pakistan, now established “iron brothers”, at the UN was indicative of rapidly maturing bilateral ties.On October 27, two days after the PRC’s return to the UN was announced, former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, wrote a warm letter to Premier Zhou Enlai.“On behalf of the Government and the people of India may I convey to your Excellency and the Government and the people of China our felicitations on the restoration of the legitimate right of representation of China by your Government in the United Nations,” she wrote.“This will make the United Nations more representative in character and will give greater weight to Asia’s participation in the deliberations of any decisions of this organisation.”“We look forward to the PRC playing its rightful role in the United Nations and working in close cooperation with your delegation in the interest of peace and progress in Asia and throughout the world,” she added.Two weeks later, India’s permanent representative to the UN, Samer Sen, followed up Gandhi’s letter with a speech welcoming Beijing’s inclusion.“In 1949, the PRC came to power in the great and ancient land of China after a long and sustained revolution. In 1950, India was the first country to propose that, as a result of this change in China, the Chinese seat in the United Nations should be occupied by the representatives of the PRC,” Sen said.“In spite of consistent efforts by India and an increasingly larger number of states, it has taken the United Nations 21 years to correct a perverse mistake. The fact that we find that today China is fully restored to its lawful rights in the United Nations is therefore a matter of great satisfaction to India,” Sen added in his speech.That satisfaction could have been short-lived as Beijing came out all diplomatic guns blazing in favour of Islamabad.“The question of East Pakistan is purely the internal affairs of Pakistan, in which no one has any right to interfere. It is impermissible for the Indian government to commit armed aggression against Pakistan by using the question of East Pakistan as a pretext. 2. The Indian government asserts that it has sent troops to East Pakistan for the purpose of ‘self-defence’. This is sheer gangster logic,” China’s UN representative Huang Hua said in a speech on December 4, 1971.Three days later, another Chinese representative, Chiao Kuan-hua said in a statement: “Supported by a certain big power, the Indian government has become most arrogant and rampant. It openly clamours that since Pakistan is a neighbour of India, the existence of Pakistan troops in East Pakistan constitutes in itself a threat to India. This is sheer fascist nonsense”.In fact, in August, 1972, China also used its first UN Security Council veto to bar the newly formed Bangladesh from entering the UN.China finally recognised Bangladesh in the middle of 1975, months after Pakistan did.China and Bangladesh at present enjoy warm ties with Beijing describing the relation as a “strategic partnership of cooperation”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/the-pakistan-factor-why-india-china-ties-remain-challenging-since-1971-101636274746003.html

The jets entered the ADIZ off Taiwan's southwestern coast, following a path similar to previous incursions.What is Taiwan's ADIZ?The ADIZ extends hundreds of kilometers from Taiwan's coast and even includes parts of mainland China. It is much larger than Taiwan's sovereign air space, which only extends 12 nautical miles from the coast.The ADIZ is airspace designated for national security purposes but is not delineated in international treaties. Taiwanese authorities reserve the right to order aircraft entering the ADIZ to identify themselves and their purpose.Although China has flown regular incursions with smaller numbers of aircraft into the ADIZ over the past several weeks, the warplanes have not entered Taiwan's sovereign airspace.EU delegates visit TaiwanThe Chinese flights into the ADIZ on Saturday came a day after a European Parliament delegation wrapped up a three-day visit to Taipei.The seven lawmakers on the parliament's committee on foreign interference in democratic processes visited last week, following up on a resolution last month calling for the body to “intensify EU-Taiwan political relations.”EU parliamentarians said the visit was not aimed at provoking China, which considers self-governing Taiwan as part of its territory and usually considers any attempt at building bilateral ties between Western nations and the government in Taipei as a provocation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-says-16-chinese-warplanes-enter-air-defense-zone-101636272235961.html
07-11-2021||World||Explainer: The difference between 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming||Over and over at the UN climate summit in Glasgow, world leaders have stressed the need to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.The 2015 Paris Agreement commits countries to limit the global average temperature rise to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, and to aim for 1.5°C.Scientists have said crossing the 1.5°C threshold risks unleashing far more severe climate change effects on people, wildlife, and ecosystems.Preventing it requires almost halving global CO2 emissions by 2030 from 2010 levels and cutting them to net-zero by 2050 -- an ambitious task that scientists, financiers, negotiators, and activists at COP26 are debating how to achieve and pay for.But what is the difference between 1.5°C and 2°C of warming? We asked several scientists to explain:Where are we now?Already, the world has heated to around 1.1°C above pre-industrial levels. Each of the last four decades was hotter than any decade since 1850."We never had such a global warming in only a few decades", said climate scientist Daniela Jacob at the Climate Service Center Germany. "Half a degree means much more extreme weather, and it can be more often, more intense, or extended in duration."Just this year, torrential rains flooded China and Western Europe, killing hundreds of people. Hundreds more died when temperatures in the Pacific Northwest hit record highs. Greenland saw massive melting events, wildfires ravaged the Mediterranean and Siberia, and record drought-hit parts of Brazil."Climate change is already affecting every inhabited region across the globe," said climate scientist Rachel Warren at the University of East Anglia.Heat, rain, droughtMore warming to 1.5°C and beyond will worsen such impacts."For every increment of global warming, changes in extremes become larger," said climate scientist Sonia Seneviratne at ETH Zurich.For example, heatwaves would become both more frequent and more severe.An extreme heat event that occurred once per decade in a climate without human influence, would happen 4.1 times a decade at 1.5°C of warming, and 5.6 times at 2°C, according to the U.N. climate science panel (IPCC).Let warming spiral to 4°C, and such an event could occur 9.4 times per decade.A warmer atmosphere can also hold more moisture, resulting in more extreme rainfall that raises flood risks. It also increases evaporation, leading to more intense droughts.Ice, seas, coral reefsThe difference between 1.5°C and 2°C is critical for Earth's oceans and frozen regions."At 1.5°C, there’s a good chance we can prevent most of Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheet from collapsing," said climate scientist Michael Mann at Pennsylvania State University.That would help limit sea-level rise to a few feet by the end of the century - still, a big change that would erode coastlines and inundate some small island states and coastal cities.But blow past 2°C and the ice sheets could collapse, Mann said, with sea levels rising up to 10 meters (30 feet)- though how quickly that could happen is uncertain.Warming of 1.5°C would destroy at least 70% of coral reefs, but at 2°C more than 99% would be lost. That would destroy fish habitats and communities that rely on reefs for their food and livelihoods.Food, forests, diseaseWarming of 2°C, versus 1.5°C, would also increase the impact on food production."If you have crop failures in a couple of the breadbaskets of the world at the same time, then you could see extreme food price spikes and hunger and famine across wide swathes of the world," said climate scientist Simon Lewis at University College London.A warmer world could see the mosquitoes that carry diseases such as malaria and dengue fever expand across a wider range. But 2°C would also see a bigger share of insects and animals lose most of their habitat range, compared with 1.5°C, and increase the risk of forest fires - another risk to wildlife.“Tipping points”As the world heats up, the risk increases that the planet will reach "tipping points", where Earth’s systems cross a threshold that triggers irreversible or cascading impacts. Exactly when those points would be reached is uncertain.Droughts, reduced rainfall, and continued destruction of the Amazon through deforestation, for example, could see the rainforest system collapse, releasing CO2 into the atmosphere rather than storing it. Or warming Arctic permafrost could cause long-frozen biomass to decompose, releasing a vast amount of carbon emissions."That's why it's so risky to keep emitting from fossil fuels ... because we're increasing the likelihood that we go over one of those tipping points," Lewis said.Beyond 2°CSo far, the climate pledges that countries have submitted to the United Nations' registry of pledges put the world on track for 2.7°C of warming. The International Energy Agency said Thursday https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/net-zero-methane-pledges-push-world-near-paris-climate-goal-iea-2021-11-04 that new promises announced at the COP26 summit - if implemented - could hold warming to below 1.8°C, although some experts challenged that calculation. It remains to be seen whether those promises will translate into real-world action.Warming of 2.7°C would deliver "unliveable heat" for parts of the year across areas of the tropics and subtropics. Biodiversity would be enormously depleted, food security would drop, and extreme weather would exceed most urban infrastructure's capacity to cope, scientists said."If we can keep warming below 3°C we likely remain within our adaptive capacity as a civilization, but at 2.7°C warmings we would experience great hardship," said Mann.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explainer-the-difference-between-1-5-c-and-2-c-of-global-warming-101636265839638.html
07-11-2021||World||Canadian firm snaps ties with supplier from China over use of North Korean labour||A major Canadian apparel company has cancelled a contract with a Chinese supplier and removed products from that source after a media expose showed that it was using forced North Korean labour.The story was broken by broadcaster CBC, which, through undercover investigations, showed that the Dandong Huayang Textiles and Garment Co, was using North Korean “guest” workers, who worked under distressing conditions, potentially under a pilot project approved by Beijing in 2014.The Canadian company, Reitmans, which has over 400 outlets in the country under multiple brands, issued a statement saying that it decided to “proactively stop issuing new business purchase orders with this supplier” at the end of 2020 and also decided to “pull all remaining inventory” of the styles originating from this supplier.It added, “We are shaken by these new allegations about the presence of North Korean guest workers in what appears to be Dandong Huayang Textiles and Garments Ltd factories.”The factory in question has refuted the allegation it was using “illegal workers”, according to CBC, in a televised report. The outlet also quoted experts as saying that using such labour was common practice in the city of Dandong, which lies close to the China-North Korea border.It also said that using such labour could be in violation of a United Nations Security Council sanctions from 2017 that banned employing North Korean migrant labour and ordered their repatriation over concerns their earnings were helping to “to support” Pyongyang’s “prohibited nuclear and ballistic missile programmes”.Reitmans, which is headquartered in Montreal, announced it will donate the unused clothing from the Chinese supplier to local charities.This isn’t the first time that use of forced labour in Chinese factories has become an issue for a Canadian company as there has been criticism and condemnation of goods sourced from Xinjiang, where China has been accused of running alleged concentration camp-like facilities for the ethnic Uighur population.Such reports led to the Canadian government announcing a policy this January “advancing measures to address the risk of forced labour from any country from entering Canadian and global supply chains and to protect Canadian businesses from becoming unknowingly complicit”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-firm-snaps-ties-with-chinese-supplier-over-use-of-north-korean-labour-101636263163912.html
07-11-2021||World||North Korea's mechanised troops conduct artillery fire drill||North Korea conducted an artillery fire drill Saturday that could target its rival Korea’s heavily populated capital after Washington and Seoul kicked off joint military aerial exercises on Monday despite Pyongyang’s rebuke. North Korea’s mechanised troops held an “artillery fire competition” to boost the country’s “mobile artillery combat capabilities,” state-run Korean Central News Agency said Sunday. The country’s leader, Kim Jong Un, didn’t watch the drill, although Pak Jong Chon, a member of the Presidium of the Political Bureau, inspected the fire competition, the state media reported. Much of North Korea’s artillery forces are deployed along the border with South Korea and are aimed at the South’s capital, home of about 10 million people and located about 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the border. The US and South Korea conducted a five-day joint air defense exercise from Monday that involved some 200 aircraft, South Korea’s Yonhap news agency reported. North Korea has claimed that the international community has a double standard, and only criticizes Pyongyang’s military drills.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-s-mechanised-troops-conduct-artillery-fire-drill-101636252996929.html

What we know so far||Iraq's Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi survived an assassination attempt early on Sunday when his residence in Baghdad was hit in an apparent drone attack, the country's officials said, adding that al-Kadhimi was unharmed in the strike and is believed to be in good health. It was the military that described the strike as an “assassination attempt” and, in an official statement released moments later, said the security forces are taking all necessary measures in connection with this “failed attempt”.What we know so farThe attack on the Iraqi prime minister's residence was carried out by an armed drone laden with explosives, according to the statement from the country's military.Two Iraqi officials told the Associated Press, on the condition of anonymity (since they were not authorised to give out official statements) that seven of prime minister al-Kadhimi's guards were injured in the attack. The officials said the drone strike actually took place in the Green Zone, a heavily fortified region in Baghdad.The Iraqi government statement, released by the state-run media moments after news of the drone strike broke, also confirmed that the failed assassination attempt was with “an explosives-laden drone” that tried to target al-Kadhimi's residence in the Green Zone.As far as the residents of Baghdad are concerned, no reports of injuries have arrived so far. The Associated Press stated that residents of the city heard the sound of an explosion, followed by gunfire, from the general direction of the Green Zone on early Sunday morning, shortly before news of the drone strike broke. Western diplomats based in the Green Zone, which houses government buildings and foreign embassies, also told the Reuters news agency that they heard explosions and gunfire in the area.Who is behind the attack?It is not immediately clear who is behind the attack on the residence, nor has any group claimed responsibility yet.The drone strike, however, comes amid a stand-off between security forces and heavily armed Shia militias aligned with Iran. In recent weeks, these pro-Iran groups have staged demonstrations near the Green Zone, protesting against the results of a general election last month which dealt a blow to their parliamentary power.One of these protests on Friday had even turned deadly when the demonstrators, having already rejected the results of the elections in which they were the biggest losers, marched toward the Green Zone and exchanged fire with security forces posted there. One of the protesters died in the resulting crossfire, news agencies reported, adding that dozens of security forces were also injured. Following the clashes, al-Kadhimi had ordered an investigation to determine which side initiated the conflict and who violated orders not to open fire.Why are the election results being contested?Although the United States and the UN Security Council (UNSC) have praised the October 10 election, which was mostly violence-free and without major technical glitches, unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud have cast a shadow over the vote.The election, which was held months ahead of schedule in response to mass protests in late 2019, saw the biggest gains made by influential Shia cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, who won the largest number of parliament seats – 73 out of 329. While he maintains good relations with Iran, al-Sadr publicly opposes external interference in Iraq's affairs.However, pro-Iran militia supporters claim mass voter fraud took place in the elections, an assertion that has not yet been substantiated with verifiable evidence. The standoff with the militia supporters has also increased tensions among rival Shia factions that could reflect on the street and threaten Iraq's newfound relative stability. These factions have also protested against the heavy-handed interference of neighbouring Iran in Iraq's affairs through Iran-backed militias.The militias lost some popularity since the 2018 vote when they made big election gains. Many hold them responsible for suppressing the 2019 protests and for challenging the state's authority. The protests appeared to be aimed at pressuring al-Sadr to ensure that Iran-aligned factions are part of the next cabinet. As the winner, al-Sadr's bloc will seek coalition partners and name the prime minister. (With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iraq-pm-mustafa-al-kadhimi-survives-drone-attack-at-residence-what-we-know-so-far-101636249667560.html

The TLP, founded in 2015, was banned in April this year after it staged violent protests demanding the expulsion of the French ambassador over ‘blasphemous’ cartoons published in France.Also Read | Pakistan reaches deal with banned TLP; frees hundreds of supporters amid clashesAccording to reports, Khan gave his consent to lift the ban following a recommendation by the provincial Punjab government through the Ministry of Interior. “The prime minister has been pleased to accord permission for submission of instant summary to the cabinet through circulation under Rule 17 (1)(b) of the Rules of Business, 1973. The approval of the cabinet is solicited to de-proscribe the TLP under Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, on the recommendation of the Punjab government,” the ministry said in an official statement on Saturday.The development comes just days after the Saad Rizvi-led group and the ruling dispensation, on October 31, arrived at a deal amid the latest round of street protests by the former. However, at the time of the announcement, the terms of the agreement were not disclosed, with both sides saying that the details would be announced at an ‘appropriate time.’ Recent days have seen the federal government set free more than 2000 workers of the extremist outfit and, with the ban removed, it will now be free to participate in all political activities. However, its chief Rizvi remains behind bars since being arrested on April 12. His release featured among the TLP's demands in its most recent agitation.Over the last few days, at least 21 people, including 10 policemen, have lost their lives in fierce clashes between members of the group and law enforcement agencies.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-pm-imran-khan-approves-removal-of-ban-on-tlp-101636249728502.html
07-11-2021||World||Brazil: 21 scientists reject prestigious medals in row with Bolsonaro||Twenty-one scientists awarded one of Brazil's highest honors, the National Order of Scientific Merit, rejected their medals Saturday after President Jair Bolsonaro withdrew two colleagues whose work apparently discomfited his government from the list of honorees.The far-right president named 25 people Wednesday to receive the honor, which Brazil created in 1992 to recognize the most important contributions to science and technology.However, two days later, he withdrew the names of two prominent scientists from the list.One was Dr. Marcus Lacerda, who published one of the first studies finding the drug chloroquine is ineffective against Covid-19 -- rebutting Bolsonaro's pet strategy for fighting the pandemic.The other was Dr. Adele Benzaken, who was fired as director of the Brazilian health ministry's HIV/AIDS department when Bolsonaro took office in 2019 after her department published a pamphlet aimed at transgender men.In protest, all 20 of the other scientists and one of the three "national personalities" named by Bolsonaro to receive the honor rejected their medals in an open letter."This is yet another clear demonstration of the persecution of scientists and the latest step in the current government's systematic attack on science and technology," they said."This act of protest, which saddens us, expresses our indignation at the destruction of Brazil's university system and of science and technology in general."Bolsonaro has faced sharp criticism from the scientific community over budget cuts for research and technology, as well as his frequent rejection of scientific findings and history of spreading misinformation, particularly on Covid-19.The president long touted chloroquine as a treatment for Covid-19 despite evidence it was ineffective, and flouted health experts' advice on face masks and stay-at-home measures to contain the pandemic.Benzaken, the director of leading public health institute Fiocruz in the Amazon region, said she was "extremely honored" by her colleagues' decision to reject their medals over what she called the government's "inelegant" treatment of her and Lacerda."That was the greatest honor of all," she told AFP, criticizing the Bolsonaro government's attitude toward science."There have been heavy cuts to funding for science in Brazil, a total disregard for statements based on scientific evidence, little value attributed to science," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-21-scientists-reject-prestigious-medals-in-row-with-bolsonaro-101636248993315.html
07-11-2021||World||Criminal probe launched into stampede at Astroworld concert that left 8 dead||A stampede of fans surging toward the stage during rap star Travis Scott's Astroworld music festival in Houston killed at least eight people and injured dozens more as panic rippled through the crowd of largely young concertgoers, officials said on Saturday.City Police Chief Troy Finner said his department has opened a criminal investigation by homicide and narcotics detectives following unconfirmed reports that someone in the audience "was injecting other people with drugs."The disaster unfolded at NRG Park at around 9:30 p.m. on Friday during the headline performance by Scott, a Grammy-nominated singer and producer, following what police and members of the crowd described as an escalation of unruly behavior throughout the day.As fans in the sold-out audience of about 50,000 pressed toward the stage, people began to fall unconscious, some apparently suffering cardiac arrest or other medical issues, officials told reporters outside the venue. Minutes later the chaos was declared a "mass casualty incident.""It happened all at once. It seemed like it just happened... over the course of just a few minutes," said Houston Police Executive Assistant Chief Larry Satterwhite, who was at the front of the event when the situation began.Satterwhite said he immediately met with promoters and they agreed to halt the show. Officials said the concert was brought to an end by 10:10 p.m.Finner said that among the "narratives" under review by police were reports suggesting "some individual was injecting other people with drugs."One report involved a security officer "who felt a prick in his neck" as he was trying to restrain or grab someone and then fell unconscious, only to be revived with a dose of the opioid antidote naloxone, Finner said, citing an account from medical personnel who treated the officer.Finner said the medical staff also noticed what appeared to be a needle mark on the officer's neck.It was not clear whether authorities suspected such an episode played a role in the crowd surge, but Finner said, "we're going to get down to the bottom of it."Police were awaiting autopsies to determine the causes of death, but said some victims were trampled.City Fire Chief Samuel Peña said it appeared the venue had ample exit routes for fans and that none was obstructed.Twenty-five people were taken to hospitals by ambulance after the crush began, some of them in cardiac arrest, with 13 still hospitalized on Saturday - five under age 18 - following the discharge of four patients, Mayor Sylvester Turner told reporters. Eight people died. Most ranged in age from 14 to 27, though one victim's age was not immediately known, Turner said.'It felt like a riot'After mobbing entrance gates and merchandise booths early in the day, the crowd grew increasingly unruly as performers took the stage, according to 19-year-old festivalgoer Hamad Al Barrak."There were just too many people,' said Al Barrak, who described chaos as he tried to buy festival gear. "We were all pressed together. You felt like you couldn't breathe."Albert Merza, 43, part of a group of eight people from Detroit attending the festival, recounted seeing "a lot of drinking and crazy behavior.""It felt like a riot," he said, adding that it appeared about half the crowd were under age 21. "There were people throwing out stuff, objects flying everywhere."Nick Johnson, 17, said he witnessed a steady rise of disruptive behavior before the stampede."It was going on for over two hours, and it just got worse and worse," he said.An incident earlier in the day in which fans started "rushing" the festival gates was brought under control relatively quickly, said Finner, the police chief, adding it appeared unrelated to the deadly stampede.Finner said police had 528 officers assigned to the festival on Friday, along with 755 private security personnel.Throughout the day, 25 arrests were made - one each for marijuana possession and public intoxication and the rest for trespassing, Finner said. Three-hundred people were treated at an on-site medical clinic for various injuries and illnesses, including several apparent drug overdoses, according to Peña.The venue could have held up to 200,000, but organizers limited the crowd to 50,000, based on ticket sales, Peña said.'Absolutely devastated'Houston-born Scott said he was "absolutely devastated" and vowed to support the police as they investigate.""My prayers go out to the families and all those impacted," Scott wrote on Twitter.Peña described how the crush of fans quickly overwhelmed the private medical personnel for the festival, a two-day affair that was scheduled to culminate on Saturday https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/deadly-texas-concert-crush-who-is-travis-scott-what-is-astroworld-2021-11-06, but was canceled after Friday night's tragedy.Videos posted to social media showed pandemonium as fans and staff tried to bring attention to injured concertgoers. One video showed fans attempting to make camera operators aware of the dangerous situation. Another video showed people waving toward the stage and chanting "Stop the show!"The investigation is likely to focus on security and safety protocols. Two weeks ago, another Houston concert was canceled after fans pushed into a Playboi Carti show being held within the same NRG Park complex.Jennifer Ortega, 22, who arrived at Friday's event at about 1 p.m. said access was orderly at that time. But by 4 p.m. the crowd at the smaller of the festival's two stages "got pretty reckless," with people throwing water bottles. She said she saw about three people leaving the area with bloody noses and missing teeth.Organizers said they were cooperating with police."We are focused on supporting local officials however we can," Astroworld Fest, an event organized by Live Nation Entertainment, said on Twitter.Scott stopped multiple times during his 75-minute performance when he spotted fans in distress and asked security to ensure their safety, video posted online showed. Emergency vehicles, lights and alarms flashing, cut through the audience several times."We need somebody to help. Somebody passed out right here," Scott said, according to video of his set, which included a guest appearance by Canadian rapper Drake. "Security, somebody, jump in here real quick."Another video clip showed police performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation on several people even as music blared in the background.The tragedy harkens back to a 1979 concert by British rock band The Who in which 11 people were killed when fans stampeded into the Riverfront Coliseum in Cincinnati before the event.Scott, who came to fame in the early 2010s for his unique vocal style has a daughter with Kylie Jenner from the famed Kardashian family. Astroworld is also the name of his third studio album released in 2018 to critical acclaim.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/criminal-probe-launched-into-stampede-at-astroworld-concert-that-left-8-dead-101636244829150.html

The wooden chest held metal and fabric objects that seem to be part of the harnesses of the chariot horses, and a chariot shaft was found resting on one of the beds.Pompeii was buried in ash when Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79 AD, killing those who hadn’t managed to leave the city in time. They were either crushed by collapsing buildings or killed by thermal shock.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pompeii-dig-yields-rare-window-into-daily-life-of-enslaved-101636238762332.html

A burnt human body and the blackened shells of several cars and motorbikes dotted the road in the eastern Freetown suburb of Wellington, where hundreds had gathered.The manager of the central state morgue in Freetown said it had received 91 bodies following the blast. More than 100 casualties have been admitted to hospitals and clinics across the capital, deputy health minister Amara Jambai told Reuters.The country’s vice-president said earlier on Saturday that at least 92 people were killed in the massive explosion.“We have received a report this morning that 92 people have died,” Mohamed Juldeh Jalloh said from the scene in an official confirmation of the toll, adding that 88 more were in hospital being treated for severe burns.“We’ve got so many casualties, burnt corpses,” said Brima Bureh Sesay, head of the national disaster management agency, in a video from the scene shared online. “It’s a terrible, terrible accident.”Videos shared online shortly after the explosion showed people running through clouds of thick smoke as large fires lit up the night sky. Reuters was not able immediately to verify the images.According to witnesses, the blast happened when a vehicle caught fire at a petrol station after a road accident. The flames then spread, burning people in cars and on roads nearby.The majority of the victims were street vendors and motorcyclists, many of whom were caught in the blaze while trying to retrieve fuel, according to volunteer worker Jusu Jacka Yorma who was at the scene.Hundreds of people gathered on Saturday morning, many searching for missing relatives under the eye of security forces.Video footage showed a burnt-out tanker and a truck, and the surrounding area littered with husks of vehicles, some still smouldering.“Deeply disturbed by the tragic fires and the horrendous loss of life,” President Julius Maada Bio wrote on Twitter.“My profound sympathies with families who have lost loved ones and those who have been maimed as a result. My government will do everything to support affected families.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dozens-killed-in-sierra-leone-fuel-tanker-blast-101636238065368.html

The stock, which surged 74% this year to a record on Thursday, closed 0.6% lower at $1,222.09 on Friday.The number of shares Musk could be set to offload based on the Twitter poll is equivalent to 80% of the average daily trading volume for Tesla in the past three months. As of 5:09 p.m. in New York, more than 55% of the 846,378 users who had voted supported Musk selling his shares. The poll will end around 3 p.m. on Sunday. Musk, the world’s richest person known for his tongue-in-cheek tweets, cited recent discussion of the wealthy hoarding unrealized gains to avoid paying taxes.The amount of Tesla stock Musk may potentially sell would be even greater if his options are included. “We are witnessing the Twitter masses deciding the outcome of a $25B coin flip,” venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya said in response to Musk’s tweet. Saturday’s tweet marks the second time within a week that Musk has discussed selling Tesla shares. On Sunday, he challenged a United Nations official who said just a small percentage of the billionaire’s wealth could help solve world hunger.

As some in the sold-out audience of about 50,000 surged toward the stage, people began to fall unconscious, some apparently suffering cardiac arrest or other medical issues, officials told reporters outside the venue. Minutes later the chaos was declared a "mass casualty incident.""It happened all at once. It seemed like it just happened ... over the course of just a few minutes," said Houston Police Executive Assistant Chief Larry Satterwhite."Within the first 30 seconds of the first song, people began to drown - in other people," a concert-goer with the Instagram handle "Seannafaith" wrote online. "It got tighter and tighter, impossible to breathe as our lungs were compressed between the bodies of those surrounding us. More people began to scream for help."Houston-born Scott said he would support the police as they investigate the incident and wanted to help the community heal."I'm absolutely devastated by what took place last night. My prayers go out to the families and all those impacted by what happened at Astroworld Festival," Scott wrote on Twitter. "Love You All."It was not yet clear what caused the disaster. An investigation was underway that is likely to focus on security and safety protocols at the event.Two weeks ago, organizers of another Houston concert canceled it abruptly after fans pushed through a gate and stormed into a Playboi Carti show being held within the same NRG Park complex.Astroworld, a two-day music festival that was scheduled to culminate on Saturday, had a similar breech at about 2:30 p.m. Friday and went ahead with the show, according to TV reports."I think it's very important that none of us speculate. Nobody has all the answers tonight," Houston Police Chief Troy Finner said at a news conference.In an interview with CNN, Houston Fire Chief Samuel Peña described how the crush of fans quickly overwhelmed the private security hired for the festival's first day.Authorities transported about 23 people in serious condition to hospitals, 11 of them critical, Pena told CNN. One of the injured was 10 years old. At least eight people succumbed to their injuries, he said, adding that the death toll could rise.Organizers and Scott were both cooperating with police."We are focused on supporting local officials however we can ...," Astroworld Fest, an event organized by Live Nation Entertainment, said on Twitter. It said it was cancelling the second day of the festival.Fans in distressScott stopped multiple times during his 75-minute performance when he spotted fans in distress near the stage, video posted online showed. He asked security to make sure they were safe. Emergency vehicles, lights and alarms flashing, cut through the audience several times."We need somebody to help. Somebody passed out right here," Scott said, according to video of his set, which included a guest appearance by Canadian rapper Drake. "Security, somebody, jump in here real quick."The tragedy harkens back to a 1979 concert by British rock band The Who in which 11 people were killed when fans stampeded into the Riverfront Coliseum in Cincinnati before the event.A reunification center was set up for families who had not heard from loved ones at the festival, the Houston Fire Department said on Twitter.Another clip, which Reuters could not immediately verify as authentic, showed police performing CPR on several people even as music blared in the background.Scott came to fame in the early 2010s for his unique vocal style. Astroworld is also the name of his third studio album released in 2018 to critical acclaim.Scott and Kylie Jenner, from the famed Kardashian family, have a daughter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/-extremely-devastated-says-travis-scott-after-8-killed-at-his-houston-concert-101636225169189.html

Wu did not name neighbouring India, but health officials have said all the recent outbreaks in China have been caused by the Delta variant of Covid, which was first detected in India earlier this year.The strict policy will continue despite China having fully vaccinated nearly 76% of its 1.4 billion population against Covid. It has administered 1.072 billion vaccines until Friday, the NHC said.A total of 37.97 million people in China have also received a third booster dose of the vaccine as of Friday, Wu said, adding that 2.3 billion doses of Covid vaccines had been administered by day’s end on Friday, an increase of about 8.9 million from the previous day.China is currently scrambling to control the latest Covid-19 outbreak, which has spread to 44 cities in 20 provinces and resulted in 918 confirmed infections since October 17. The outbreak is driven by the more transmissible Delta variant.Since the initial epidemic in the central Chinese city of Wuhan last year, at least 30 smaller outbreaks have been recorded.The numbers of infections are small but China has responded to the outbreaks with strict lockdowns, mass nucleic acid testing and intra-provincial travel restrictions.“Real-world practices have shown that our disease control strategy fits the condition of the country and is science-based. The strategy has also balanced disease control requests and development of society and economy,” top health official Wu said.The Chinese mainland on Friday reported 40 new locally transmitted Covid-19 cases, the NHC said in its daily report on Saturday. Of the new local cases, 16 were reported in Heilongjiang; nine in Hebei; three each in Liaoning, Henan and Sichuan; two each in Yunnan and Gansu; and one each in Inner Mongolia and Jiangxi.Mainland China has reported 97,660 coronavirus cases so far, with 4,636 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-continue-covid-19-curbs-amid-overseas-outbreaks-top-health-official-101636200804840.html

07-11-2021||India||HT This Day: Nov 8, 1975 — Mrs Gandhi’s election upheld, unanimous verdict of Supreme Court||The Supreme Court today (November 7) unanimously upheld the election of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi from the Rae Bareli Lok Sabha constituency in 1971 and reversed the judgment of the Allahabad High Court setting aside her election and disqualifying her.The judgment of the five-member constitution bench of the court was handed down today. In five separate judgments, the court upheld the validity of the amendments to the election laws made in 1974 and in 1975. They ruled that Mrs Gandhi had committed no corrupt practice and had not exceeded the ceiling in her election expenses.The five judges - Chief Justice A. N. Ray, and Justices H. R. Khanna, K. K. Wathew, M. H. Beg and Y. V. Chandrachud gave varying reasons for their conclusions.Chief Justice Ray, Mr Khanna and Mr Mathew have upheld the changes in the Constitution, barring one part, and election laws amendments in 1974 and 1975.The three were unanimous in holding as bad the new Clause 4 of Article 329A of the Constitution which validated Mrs Gandhi’s election.The Chief Justice, whose ruling was first handed down, upheld the validity of the changes in the election law made in 1974 and 1975 to decide, the High Court finding that Mrs Gandhi’s election was in valid because of the corrupt practices of using Government servants for advancing her election prospects.He also upheld the Allahabad High Court judgment rejecting Mr Raj Narain’s contentions that the ‘cow and calf’used by Mrs Gandhi was a religious symbol and that she had exceeded the prescribed celling on election expenses.The Chief Justice struck down Article 329-A(4) because it was “declaratory judgment and not a law”. The “constituent power” (legislature) could exercise judicial power “but it has to apply law”, he affirmed.(Clause 4 of Article 329(A) lays down that the election to Parliament of the Prime Minister and the Speaker of the Lok Sabha cannot be void under any law or court order made before the 30th Constitutes Amendment).Mr Khanna struck down this clause on the ground that it “violates the principle of free and fair elections which is an essential postulate of Democracy and is a part of the basic structure of the Constitution.He said the validity of the other provisions of the 39th Amendment could not be assailed on the ground either of the wisdom of the legislature or the propriety or of the detention of some MPs at the time of its passage.The court was filled to capacity by the time the five judges entered at 10.30 a.m.Mr A K Sen and Mr J. B Dadachandji for the Prime Minister and Mr J P Goel and V Khandooja for Mr Raj Narain were among the counsels present. Mr Shanti Bhushan, chief counsel for Mr Narain, was not in the court.Mr Ray took 50 minutes to reed extracts from his 90-page judgement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htthis-day-nov-8-1975-mrs-gandhi-s-election-upheld-unanimous-verdict-of-supreme-court-101636308049920.html

"Crude oil prices were 105 US dollars in 2014 and now it is 83 US dollars. BJP lied to the public saying that prices of petrol and diesel have increased internationally," news agency ANI quoted Chandrashekhar Rao as saying in Hyderabad on Sunday."What has BJP done in the last 7 years? India’s GDP is less than Bangladesh, Pakistan and Centre has increased taxes unnecessarily," KCR, as the Chief Minister is popularly known, said.The Telangana CM also demanded the Central government to remove the cess on petrol and fuel. “We will continue to fight...and we will hold dharna for withdrawing cess on petrol and diesel,” he said.He also raked up a report given by the Pentagon to the US Congress confirming that China has intruded 4.5 km within the territory of Arunachal Pradesh. “China is attacking us in Arunachal Pradesh but Centre hasn't taken any action,” the Telangana CM said, continuing his tirade against the Centre.Also read | Andhra Pradesh rules out reducing VAT on petrol, clarifies stance via adAlleging that the Telangana Bharatiya Janata Party leaders are claiming they would file cases against him and send him to prison, KCR dared the leaders to touch him. “We'll cut your tongues if you pass unnecessary comments on us,” KCR warned.We'll cut your (TS BJP leaders) tongues if you pass unnecessary comments on us.

07-11-2021||India||Andhra Pradesh rules out reducing VAT on petrol, clarifies stance via ad||The Andhra Pradesh government ruled out reducing value-added tax on petrol and diesel on Sunday and also took out an ad in several newspapers clarifying its stand on the issue.The AP government justified its move by saying that the Centre did not adequately compensate the state government despite collecting ₹3.35 lakh crore as central excise. The ads published by the government came after the opposition parties protested against the state government for not reducing VAT on petrol and diesel.“Although the central government collected ₹3.35 lakh crore as Central Excise on petrol and diesel, it distributed only ₹19,475 crore as state’s share, which is just 5.80%. The Centre has to distribute 41% of taxes collected to the states,” the Andhra government said in its ad.It also published a table in the ad where it showed excise duty collected (by the Centre) as only ₹47,500 crore, of which 41% ( ₹19,475 crore) was given away as the state’s share while also claiming that Centre collected ₹2.87 lakh crore in the form of cess and surcharges to avoid a divisible pool of petro income and thereby reduced the state’s share of petro revenue.The ad which was issued by the Andhra Pradesh government was issued under the name of minister Buggana Rajendranth who further added that the state government was collecting an additional VAT of ₹4 and a cess of Re 1, apart from the 31% and 22.5% VAT, on a litre of petrol and diesel respectively.“The very same people who have increased the price of a litre petrol and diesel beyond ₹100 and reduced it now by just ₹5 and 10 are protesting on roads for political mileage,” the state government said via the ad while claiming that it imposed a special duty of “just one rupee” per litre as development and repair of 8,970 km of roads was undertaken.“The ad is full of lies. How could the state government make false claims based on all-India revenue? It should clearly state how much share it has received from the Centre,” BJP Andhra Pradesh president Somu Veerraju said and claimed that the information in the ad was misleading. The Telugu Desam Party (TDP) also criticized the government and said that it revealed the state government’s true intentions regarding the reduction in fuel prices. It also called the advertisement “fake”.(with inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-pradesh-rules-out-reducing-vat-on-petrol-clarifies-stance-via-ad-101636303208304.html

Kejriwal was responding to allegations of indulging in “soft Hindutva” before assembly elections commenced in five states.“Do you not go to temple? There is nothing wrong with visiting temples... I am a Hindu, I visit Ram temple, Hanuman temple.. why would anyone have a problem with it?...Why are they accusing me? Let people say,” the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener told reporters in Panaji.AAP, which is looking to make in-roads in Uttar Pradesh in next year’s assembly elections, announced a tiranga yatra in Ayodhya last month, in a bid to woo upper caste voters. The party had failed to make any headway in UP in the previous assembly election and lost their deposit in 76 of the 77 seats it contested.The yatra was launched by Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and AAP’s UP in-charge Sanjay Singh. Both of them also visited the Ram Janmabhoomi and Hanumangarhi temple in Ayodhya.Kejriwal, who is on a tour of poll-bound Goa, became the first Delhi chief minister to visit the head office of the Gomantak Bhandari Samaj in Panaji on Sunday."Goa is the land of Lord Parashurama. On this land, the Gomantak Bhandari Samaj was established in the city of Panaji in 1962. Delhi CM Kejriwal has come to meet the people of the Bhandari community. It is a matter of pride for us. This is the first time that the Chief Minister of Delhi has come to meet the people of the Gomantak Bhandari community," Ashok Naik, the Gomantak Bhandari Samaj president, told news agency ANI.Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant hit out at Kejriwal over the latter’s pilgrimage scheme, claiming that the Delhi-based party was copying his government’s policies. Kejriwal in turn accused Sawant of copying him.Alleging that Pramod Sawant is copying AAP, he said, "When I said we will give electricity free, he gave water free. When I said we will provide employment allowance, he announced about 10,000 jobs, and when I spoke about pilgrimages, he announced his scheme.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-visit-ram-temple-because-i-am-a-hindu-arvind-kejriwal-on-allegations-of-peddling-soft-hindutva-101636302113604.html

Yadav, who also inducted senior BSP leaders Lalji Verma and Ramachal Rajbhar in the Samajwadi Party, said that the ‘triple-engine’ of the BJP will not allow farmers to get justice.Yadav’s ‘triple-engine’ jibe was apparently a reference to Union minister Ajay Mishra’s son Ashish Mishra’s car allegedly mowing down 4 protesters in Lakhimpur Kheri last month, with the double engine being the BJP-run governments at the centre and in Uttar Pradesh. He said if the BJP remains in power in the state farmers will not get justice.“The farmers are our backbone, who give support to the economy, and are our 'annadata', but the BJP government has cheated them and has done injustice to them,” Yadav was quoted as saying by news agency PTI. Yadav also attacked the Centre’s scheme aimed at distribution of LPG cylinders to poor households, the ‘Ujjwala Yojana’.“Due to price rise, the 'Ujjwala Yojana' has become 'bujwalla' (a damp squib)yojana. And our 'Baba Chief Minister' sometimes is afraid of red colour. Our CM in order to reduce the price rise can change the colour of the cylinder or its name,” Yadav was quoted as saying.He also claimed that the recent slashing of fuel prices by reducing taxes was a byproduct of the BJP’s performance in the bypolls adding that the prices will drop further if BJP loses the Uttar Pradesh assembly polls. The Samajwadi Party leader also claimed that India’s earned a bad reputation due ‘poor handling of the Covid-19 pandemic’.Yadav sharpened his attack against Yogi Adityanath using the UP government’s promise to distribute laptops to students. He said that ‘the world has moved on since and people are carrying computers in their pockets in the form of phones’. In an apparent reference to the CM, Yadav asked people not to ‘look up to a leader who doesn’t know how to operate a laptop’ while challenging the government to reveal the figures for the number of laptops distributed in the last four and half years the BJP has been in power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjps-triple-engine-govt-will-not-give-justice-to-farmers-akhilesh-101636297823721.html
07-11-2021||India||Delhi HC dissolves marriage, says husband viewed his wife only as a 'cash cow'||The Delhi High Court has granted divorce to a couple and dissolved the marriage under the Hindu Marriage Act, setting aside a family court's order which rejected the wife's divorce plea.Citing the husband's materialistic attitude, the court observed that the husband viewed his wife as a "cash cow" and became interested in her only after she got a job with the Delhi Police, said a report by news agency PTI on Sunday.A bench headed by Justice Vipin Sanghi said the relationship would have brought mental agony and trauma to the wife as the husband did not have any emotional ties with her.The bench, also comprising Justice Jasmeet Singh, observed that the husband appeared to be "not interested in nurturing the marriage but only interested in the wife's income"."The continued distance between the parties even after the appellant (wife) attained majority would, in itself, have caused trauma and resulted in cruelty to the appellant apart from everything else... (the) circumstance probabalises the stand of the appellant, that the respondent (husband) harassed the appellant to pocket her income, since he was himself unemployed,” PTI quoted the court as saying."The respondent, it appears, viewed the appellant as a cash cow and became interested in her only after she got the job with the Delhi Police. Such brazenly materialistic attitude of the respondent, with no emotional ties, would have in itself caused mental agony and trauma to the appellant sufficient to constitute cruelty to her,” the court added.The woman sought a divorce on the grounds that the husband was unemployed, an alcoholic and used to physically abuse her and demand money.According to the PTI report, the marriage was solemnised when the husband and the wife were 19 years old and 13 years old, respectively. The wife was not taken to the matrimonial home until November 2014, that is, when she secured a job with the Delhi Police, said the report further.The husband opposed the dissolution of marriage on the ground that he funded the woman's education because of which she secured the job.The court observed that since the wife was living with her parents till 2014, it was "obvious that all her expenses for living and upbringing would have been borne by her parents" and there was nothing to show the contrary.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-dissolves-marriage-says-husband-viewed-his-wife-only-as-a-cash-cow-101636295790620.html

07-11-2021||India||India condemns attempt on life of Iraqi PM||India on Sunday condemned an attempt on the life of Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi, saying terrorism and violence have no place in society and cannot be allowed to undermine peace and stability in the West Asian country.Al-Kadhimi escaped an assassination attempt after explosives-laden drones targeted his residence in Baghdad on Sunday. The attack added to tensions over the refusal by Iran-backed militias to accept last month’s parliamentary election results.Seven security guards were injured in the attack by at least three drones in the heavily fortified Green Zone. There was no claim for the attack, but suspicion immediately fell on the Iran-backed militias that have publicly attacked Al-Kadhimi and issued threats.External affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi responded to the attack by condemning it and expressing concern over the casualties.“We strongly condemn the assassination attempt by drone attack [on Sunday] morning on the Iraqi Prime Minister, Mr Mustafa al-Kadhimi,” he said.“Terrorism and violence have no place in any civilised society. They cannot be allowed to undermine peace and stability in Iraq,” he added.Bagchi also expressed India’s concerns for the casualties caused by the attack and reiterated the country’s “support for the democratic process in Iraq”.Troops deployed around Baghdad following the failed assassination attempt. Al-Kadhimi was unharmed and later appeared on Iraqi television, his left hand wrapped in a bandage. An aide confirmed a light cut.“Cowardly rocket and drone attacks don’t build homelands and don’t build a future,” he said. He called for calm and constructive dialogue “for the sake of Iraq and the future of Iraq”.Iraqi interior ministry spokesman Gen Saad Maan, speaking to a state-run media outlet, said security forces were able to down two of the three drones used for the attack. The US state department also condemned what it said was an “apparent act of terrorism”. Spokesperson Ned Price said, “We are in close touch with the Iraqi security forces charged with upholding Iraq’s sovereignty and independence and have offered our assistance as they investigate this attack.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-condemns-attempt-on-life-of-iraqi-pm-101636296589116.html

07-11-2021||India||Mullaperiyar dam: Kerala revokes controversial order on tree felling||The Kerala government has revoked the controversial order permitting Tamil Nadu to cut 15 trees to strengthen the baby dam in Mullaperiyar, said state forest minister AK Saseendran on Sunday adding that permission was granted by mistake and action will be taken against officials concerned. “I have no idea who gave the order. It never came up for discussion. Officials who were behind such a move will have to be answerable,” said the minister. Water resources minister Roshy Augustine, hailing from Idukki where the dam is situated, also said he is not aware of the permission granted to Tamil Nadu. Junior partner in the ruling Left Democratic Front, the Communist Party of India also expressed serious reservations over the matter. The issue came to light after Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin sent a letter to his Kerala counterpart Pinarayi Vijayan on Saturday thanking him for the permission to cut trees near the baby dam in Mullaperiyar reservoir.The letter triggered a big controversy in the state and opposition Congress and BJP alleged that the CM’s office gave permission bypassing concerned ministries. They said the decision will weaken the state’s long-pending demand for a new dam. “The CM should clarify his position on TN’s decision to raise the water level to 152 feet. He said in the assembly recently that TN has shown a favourable approach to Kerala’s growing concern. But this is not a favourable move,” said former water resources minister NK Premachandran MP. The opposition said officials can’t decide on their own and the government is searching for scapegoats now. The CM is yet to react to the issue. The TN CM’s letter came at a time when TN minister Dorai Murugan’s statement, that the state will raise the water level to 152 feet after strengthening the baby dam, triggered a big protest in downstream areas of the dam. There are reports that chief wildlife warden Bennichan Thomas prepared the order after a meeting of concerned secretaries. But once the issue snowballed into a big controversy, officials disowned the controversial decision and blamed the political leadership. Two states have been fighting over the water level in the 126 -year-old Mullaperiyar dam for more than two decades. While Kerala wants the water level to be reduced to 138 feet and build a new dam, TN favours water level should be raised to 152 feet saying it was strong enough to withstand any pressure.Idukki district, where Mullaperiyar is situated, has around 20 small and big dams. Four are major ones and include Mullaperiyar, Idukki, Gavi and Kaki. Dam experts fear a chain reaction in case of a disaster that will affect 3.5 million people living downstream. Tamil Nadu, however, dismisses it saying it is strong enough and every year it carries out regular maintenance. While Kerala insists on a new dam, Tamil Nadu is opposing it fearing it may lose control over the dam which is the lifeline of five districts in southern TN.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mullaperiyar-dam-kerala-revokes-controversial-order-on-tree-felling-101636295150303.html

Malik, however, taunted the Delhi 'netas' saying they express condolences even when an animal dies, but no condolences were offered when 600 people died during the farmers' protest, he claimed.“600 people have died in this farm movement... Even when an animal dies, Delhi 'netas' express condolences, but they could not pass the proposal of 600 farmers in Lok Sabha..,” news agency ANI quoted Malik as saying in Jaipur, in an apparent swipe at the Union government.Malik added that he would leave the governor's post if he's asked to do so by 'Delhi people'.“If I say something on farm issues, it will become a controversy. I wait for weeks for a call from Delhi...A Guv can't be removed but my well-wishers wait for me to say something... The day I am told by Delhi people to leave, I will do so,” Malik, who was also the governor of Jammu and Kashmir, said further.#WATCH | 600 people have died in this farm movement... Even when an animal dies, Delhi 'netas' express condolences, but they could not pass the proposal of 600 farmers in Lok Sabha..: Meghalaya Governor Satya Pal Malik, in Jaipur pic.twitter.com/Mz8RiaCScCThis comes days after Satya Pal Malik said the Bharatiya Janata Party will not return to power unless the government listens to the farmers agitating over the farm laws. In March, Malik extended his support to the farmers' agitation and asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah to not offend the protesters.Farmers have been protesting at different sites since November 26 last year against the three farm laws.In October, Mailk accused the Pramod Sawant-led Goa government of corruption.“There was corruption in everything the Goa government did (during the Covid-19 pandemic). I was removed for my allegation of corruption against the Goa government,” Malik alleged.This led to opposition parties demanding the sacking of Promod Sawant. “You must immediately seek resignation from the chief minister and announce investigation by an independent agency,” the AITC's memorandum to the governor P S Sridharan Pillai said.Congress spokesperson Gourav Vallabh said Malik's interview endorsed the corruption allegations leveled by the Congress, and demanded dismissal of the Sawant-led cabinet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/even-when-an-animal-dies-satya-pal-malik-s-swipe-at-centre-over-farm-laws-101636290032239.html
07-11-2021||India||Why Aryan Khan, Arbaaz Merchant, Achit Kumar have been summoned by NCB again||As the drugs-on-cruise has now been transferred to a special investigation team of the Narcotics Control Bureau, comprising officials from New Delhi, Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan Khan has already been summoned to appear before this new team probing the case. News agency ANI reported Arbaaz Merchant and Achit Kumar already reached the NCB office on Sunday. Reports claimed that Aryan was asked to be present before the SIT on Sunday but because of a slight fever, he could not come on Sunday. Since Aryan's case is not the only case that has been transferred to this Delhi team, Nawab Malik's son-in-law Sameer Khan is also likely to be summoned as his case has also been transferred from NCB Mumbai to NCB SIT. The transfer of the case came at a time NCB Mumbai chief Sameer Wankhede is facing a vigilance probe. The central agency, however, said the cases have been shifted because of the national importance of the cases.Aryan Khan and Arbaaz Merchant, friends from childhood, were arrested from a Goa-bound cruise party on allegations of doing drugs. Achit Kumar was arrested later based on the information given by Aryan and Arbaaz who told investigators that Achit got them drugs. All three of them are now out on bail. According to Aryan and Arbaaz's bail conditions, they have to visit the NCB office every Friday. In addition, they will have to be present at the NCB as and when required for the investigation.The Aryan Khan case is now under Deputy Director-General Sanjay Kumar Singh who is heading the SIT. Sameer Wankhede will assist in the investigation, he said.Apart from the Aryan Khan case, the other five cases that now lie with the SIT include the Samir Khan case (son-in-law of Nawab Malik), the Mumbra case, Jogeshwari case, Dongri case and Armaan Kohli case.The cruise case took a bigger political turn because of the involvement of Shah Rukh Khan's son as the Nationalist Congress Party and the BJP are now trading barbs over the case. Meanwhile, some reports claimed Shah Rukh Khan visited Delhi at the weekend and was seen at a private airport in Mumbai as he returned on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-aryan-khan-arbaaz-merchant-achit-kumar-have-been-summoned-by-ncb-again-101636291326252.html

Governments cannot use stringent laws like UAPA to suppress reporting on such incidents,” it said.ALSO READ | Tripura violence: Cong, CPI(M) condemn police action against lawyers, othersThe EGI demanded that the state government conduct an objective and fair investigation into the circumstances of the rights instead of penalising journalists and civil society activists.“Further, the Guild reiterates its earlier demand to the Supreme Court of India to take cognisance of the manner in which such laws are unjustifiably used against freedom of speech, and to issue stringent guidelines on charging journalist under them, so that these laws don't become an easy tool for suppressing press freedom,” it said.A mosque was vandalised and two shops were set ablaze at Chamtilla in Tripura during a rally by Vishva Hindu Parishad on October 26, called to protest against the communal violence in neighbouring Bangladesh.Three houses and a few shops, reportedly owned by Muslims, were also ransacked in nearby Rowa Bazar, according to police.The state government had on October 29 alleged that a group from outside with vested interests had hatched a conspiracy against the administration to create unrest in Tripura and malign its image by uploading fake photographs of a burning mosque on social media after the October 26 incident.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/editors-guild-condemns-police-action-against-journalists-in-tripura-under-uapa-101636286346781.html

The ED moved the HC on Saturday night after the special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court refused additional custody of Deshmukh to ED and sent him to 14-day judicial custody. ED argued before the single judge bench of justice Madhav Jamdar that the money laundering case probe was at a crucial stage and refusal to extend Deshmukh’s custody will hamper the entire investigation.Senior advocate Vikram Chaudhri and advocate Aniket Nikam, representing Deshmukh, said they were not opposing ED’s application and were willing to cooperate since the day the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader visited ED’s office on November 2 and was subsequently arrested after 12 hours of interrogation. After hearing the submissions, justice Jamdar granted custody of Deshmukh to ED till November 12.

In our country, the consumption of masks and PPE kits, oxygen and medicines went up and no efforts were spared by the Union government to make provisions for increase in consumption. In January 2020, we got the first [Covid-19] positive case and nowhere in the world did anyone know what to do; within nine months task forces were step up, the PM visited the labs and encouraged the scientists and the result is that 30% of the population has been given both doses [of anti- Covid vaccines] and the [World Health Organization] WHO has given its nod to the India-made COVAXIN,” he said.BJP’s NEC is meeting after two years. It is the key decision making body of the party comprising chief ministers of BJP ruled states, state unit presidents and other functionaries. “Whenever there has been a tragedy of this scale, economy is disrupted, transportation is affected and hunger strikes, the biggest challenge is to meet the need for food, but because of the PM’s foresight, we rolled out the biggest food programme which gave 80 crore people ration every month including 5 kgs of grain and pulses,” he said.He said the decisions taken by the Union government helped bring the economy back on rails and businesses were growing. “The biggest example is the increase in the collection of GST,” Pradhan said .Pradhan said party had used technological platforms for the first time, allowing 218 of the 342 members to be present at the NEC meeting virtually. Party veterans LK Advani and MM Joshi too had joined from their respective residences.The NEC also thanked the PM for repealing article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir and implementation of the Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019.“When CAA was passed; people said all kinds of things. …when the Taliban took over Afghanistan, PM’s foresight was proved right. The categories [of eligible people under the law] we had planned to help, have been given security within the constitutional framework,” he said.

In 2014, farmers used to get ₹23,000 crore in the budget, however, in the last budget, the amount reached ₹123,000 crore. The MSP [minimum support price] of all agricultural commodities has been increased and the government has demonstrated the highest responsibility,” he said.Talking about the steps taken to address the concerns of Sikhs in particular; Pradhan said the Modi government did four major things, the gurudwara were allowed FCRA grant; the langars have been exempt from GST, and ₹120 crore had been spent for the Kartarpur corridor completion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-thanks-pm-modi-for-steps-taken-to-revive-economy-101636278826158.html
07-11-2021||India||BJP sets new targets for expansion||The Bharatiya Janata Party has set three targets for expansion of base in poll-bound states and in regions where its organisational structure is weak. The party aims to set up booth committees in all the 104,000 polling stations in the country by December 25; appoint panna pramukhs ( voter list in charge) in all states by April 6, 2022; and ensure broadcast of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s radio programme ‘Man Ki Baat’ by May 2022 across all polling booths in the country.Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Sunday said the targets were set at the ongoing meeting of the national executive committee in the Capital.“In Gujarat, the party carried out an experiment, where apart from booth committees, page committees were also set up. By December 25, all booth committees will be ready, at present about 85% have been completed. Now, we will also have the target of [appointing] panna pramukhs in all the polling station[s],” he said.The BJP relies on these organisational units on the ground to increase people to people contact, and increase the scope of its election campaign, the leader said.The institutionalised broadcast of the PM’s monthly radio show Man Ki Baat is aimed at enhancing the reach of Narendra Modi’s message to the people. “The PM speaks directly to the people, through Mann ki Baat and at the booth level it will be institutionalised by making arrangement by May 2022 for its relay,” Pradhan said.He added that party president JP Nadda quoted his predecessor Amit Shah at the NEC meet while exhorting BJP members to increase the party’s foot print and said that its “peak was yet to come”.Also Read | New story in Bengal: Nadda’s message to party workers at key BJP meet“In 2014, Shah had set targets, many of which we achieved such as (winning) Assam, Tripura and other states in the NE. He had said that Uttkarsh Aana Baki Hai, Nadda repeated it,” Pradhan said.“There are many challenges ahead still. We will review the past, draw up the future plans,” Pradhan said. The party has set its sights on becoming a dominant political force in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Telengana and Andhra Pradesh.“In Telangana, the party has already made an impact, it has won in two by polls indicating that the party is emerging as an alternative to the ruling TRS,” Pradhan said .He also cited the BJP’s increased vote share in West Bengal between 2016 to 2021 as an example of exponential growth. “ Only NT Rama Rao had accomplished such a feat when he defeated the Congress,” Pradhan said .Pradhan, who is also in charge of party’s UP election campaign, said party leaders expressed gratitude towards the PM at the NEC meet for his foresight and efforts in bringing the country back on track after the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-sets-new-targets-for-expansion-101636276485820.html

"If Aslam Shaikh had gone there it would have been Udta Maharashtra after Udta Punjab," Nawab Malik said, alleging that as Aryan Khan was invited to the party and did not buy the tickets himself, it was a case of kidnapping.Citing a witness in the case, Vijay Pagare, Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik said the plan of 'kidnapping' Aryan Khan was hatched in the Lalit hotel for the last seven months.Using Nawab Malik's statement of Kashiff Khan forcing Aslam Shaikh, BJP leader Mohit Bharatiya said, "Nawab Malik confirmed that Aslam Shaikh has relations with Kashiff Khan and that the children of NCP leaders, ministers are in contact with drug peddlers. Sunil Patil and Nawab Malik are friends for the last 20 years. When Sunil Patil used to have parties in Lalit Hotel, Nawab Malik used to go there.

07-11-2021||India||Nawab Malik claims BJP leader behind Aryan Khan’s ‘kidnapping & ransom’ plot||Maharashtra minister and senior Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Nawab Malik on Sunday alleged that the Narcotics Control Bureau’s (NCB) Mumbai zonal director Sameer Wankhede was part of a plot to “kidnap” Aryan Khan, the son of Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, for ransom, and former BJP Yuva Morcha president in Mumbai, Mohit Bharatiya was the “mastermind” . Aryan Khan was held on October 3 last month on the charges of drug consumption and involvement in international drug trade following the alleged recovery of drugs from a cruise ship off the Mumbai coast in a raid by a NCB team led by Wankhede. However, Malik, in a series of press conferences, has alleged that Wankhede ran a drugs and extortion racket and Bhartiya too was involved in the fake raid to “frame” Aryan Khan. On Sunday, Malik also alleged that Aryan’s father Shahrukh Khan and his private secretary Pooja Dadlani were threatened that they will be falsely framed for giving bribe. Malik alleged that Mohit Kamboj Bhartiya was part of a “private army” operated by Wankhede and had met him at a graveyard in suburban Oshiwara regarding the plot. The minister further said that Aryan Khan was trapped and made to come to the cruise party through Kamboj’s brother-in-law and two others. He also claimed that the people associated with the cruise party including Sam D’souza and Manish Bhanushali were putting up at Hotel Lalit since September 27. Kamboj had earlier on October 9, asked Malik to desist from making defamatory statements and filed a defamation case on October 26.On Sunday, Malik also refuted Bhartiya’s allegation that Sunil Patilwas a NCP worker who had orchestrated the cruise drugs case and instead alleged that Patil’s many pictures with BJP leaders including with a Union minister were circulating on social media, suggesting otherwise. “Mohit Kamboj has said that Sunil Patil is associated with NCP and its leaders. I would like to clarify that I have never met him. Patil is a fraud and an action needs to be taken against him, but it is not true that he is associated with us.In fact his pictures with many top BJP leaders are making rounds in social media,” he said. Malik also released an audio clip of a conversation between Sanville D’souza and NCB officer VV Singh.Sam D’souza’s real name is Sanville D’souza and he is an accused in a weed bakery case. Malik asked why NCB had not arrested him in the last four months. Bharatiya on Saturday alleged that Sunil Patil was an NCP member and had given the number of Kiran Gosavi, an independent witness in the cruise drugs case, to Sam D’Souza and told him that Gosavi will co-ordinate with the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB). Also Read: Bombay HC remands ex-Maha minister Anil Deshmukh in ED custody till November 12Malik on Sunday said that his cabinet colleague and Congress leader Aslam Shaikh and a few children related to the ruling party leaders were invited to the Cordelia cruise ship party with the intention of framing them. BJP leader and former minister Ashish Shelar has demanded an FIR against Sunil Patil and a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe in the entire matter. “The daily press conferences by Nawab Malik are an attempt to shield people involved in drug racket and police transfers. Patil is part of an inter state racket which needs to be investigated by an agency like CBI,” he said. BJP leader and law maker Ram Kadam claimed that Nawab Malik was on the back foot after realising that the ruling party’s link to the drug case had been exposed. “...In fact the ruling party leaders were involved in extortion from Shah Rukh Khan through Kiran Gosavi. The extortion racket was being run by the ruling party leaders and it was part-2 of ‘Vaze Vasuligate’. Now, the state government should seek a CBI inquiry in the drug case. It should also conduct a narco test on Kiran Gosavi and others,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nawab-malik-claims-bjp-leader-behind-aryan-khan-s-kidnapping-ransom-plot-101636274025876.html

It was Pratik Gaba and Amir Furniturewala who brought him there. It's a matter of kidnapping and ransom. Mohit Kamboj is the mastermind and partner of Sameer Wankhede in demanding ransom.”2. “Mohit Kamboj and Sameer Wankhede met outside the Oshiwara graveyard on October 7, after which Wankhede panicked and complained to the police that they were being chased. They were lucky that the nearby CCTV camera was not working and we couldn't get the feed.”3. “A paper roll that was a brand of Fashion TV was seized in the case and it is being said the drug is consumed through that roll. Why was the owner not arrested? The owner of this brand is Kashiff Khan. He is a partner of Wankhede and was present at the party.”4. “Kashiff Khan forced our minister Aslam Shaikh to come to the party and was also planning to bring the children of various ministers of our government to the party. Had Aslam Shaikh gone there it would have been ‘Udta Maharashtra’ after ‘Udta Punjab’.”5. “Vijay Pagare told me that they were staying in the Lalit hotel for the last seven months. Manish, Vilas Bhanushali, and Sam D'Souza used to go visit them. Girls were also known to frequent the place; drugs were consumed and the money was also exchanged there.”Pagare is the Mumbai-based businessman who earlier made the sensational claim that the October 2 cruise raid was “pre-planned” and that there was a long line of political games being played in the backdrop of Maharashtra that resulted in such a raid.Pagare recorded his statement with the Mumbai Police earlier this week, where he said that he personally knew people involved with the raid, including NCB’s independent witness Kiran Gosavi, whose selfie with Aryan Khan went viral on the internet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wouldve-been-udta-maharashtra-nawab-malik-s-latest-claims-on-drugs-bust-in-5-points-101636265039682.html

The current dip in daily cases was partly due to the lower number of tests conducted owing to the festive season. In the past 24 hours, the state tested 70,179 samples, and on Friday, it conducted 57,290 tests. In comparison, the 522 cases registered on April 27 last year resulted from 5,217 tests at a high positivity rate of 10.01%, over 9% more than the 0.94% registered on Friday.

Mumbai, meanwhile, reported 176 new Covid cases and 4 related deaths, pushing the toll to 16,273. Mumbai’s active caseload dropped to 3,819. The number of active cases in the state stood at 14,714.For the past few months, Maharashtra has seen a downward trend in the number of new infections. The state health department officials said that even when the number of tests go up again, daily Covid cases in the state were likely to remain under 1000. “There is no significant increase or spurt anywhere in the past few weeks. We expect the state to maintain around 1,000 fresh cases daily,” an official said, requesting anonymity.Also Read: Two dead after blaze at a residential building in MumbaiPune rural reported 134 new cases on Saturday but Pune city and Pimpri-Chinchwad reported no fresh cases, the state’s daily bulletin showed.“In many districts, the testing centres, including private ones, were shut due to Diwali.

Taking to Twitter, the actor explained he made the appeal as a citizen and not as an actor, adding that he raised the issue so that nobody has to face a similar problem in the near future.“What if the food doesn't get delivered but (the app) shows it has been delivered? Should people stay hungry? It is not about delivering new clothes, when one can wait. It is about food,” Chatterjee tweeted. He added that though some people might still laugh at him, he only wanted to make people aware that employees from the service industry should be more responsible.“I have no personal grudge against anyone. In fact, I have ordered food against through this very food delivery app. I'm sure there are people who have faced similar issues. I just want that this never happens to anyone of us,” the 62-year-old further said. https://t.co/ef7BQHd3A4 pic.twitter.com/hgh4RWR9VBOn Saturday, Chatterjee tagged both PM Modi and CM Mamata in a tweet in which he described an issue he recently faced with Swiggy. “On 3rd November, I placed an order. After some time the status of the order changed to delivered, but I never received the food.

07-11-2021||India||Pak court acquits 6 leaders of Hafiz Saeed's banned JuD outfit. Charges explained||Six leaders of the banned Jamaat-ud-Dawah (JuD) terror outfit, founded by Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) chief and 26/11 Mumbai terror attack mastermind Hafiz Saeed, were acquitted by a Pakistan court on Saturday in a terror-financing case. The Lahore high court set aside a trial court's conviction and acquitted the six leaders of the banned outfit, the front organisation for the Lashkar outfit.In April this year, an anti-terrorism court in Lahore had handed a nine-year imprisonment term to each of the five top JuD leaders – Malik Zafar Iqbal, Yahya Mujahid (JuD spokesperson), Nasarullah, Samiullah, and Umar Bahadur. A six-month jail term was also handed to JuD chief Hafiz Saeed's brother-in-law Hafiz Abdul Rehman Makki, following up on an FIR registered by the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) of the Punjab Police.What were the charges?The notorious leaders were found guilty of terror financing, specifically for collecting funds and channeling them to LeT accounts, thereby, unlawfully financing the proscribed terror outfit. The trial court convicted the JuD leaders of terror financing-related charges and also ordered the confiscation of assets made from funds collected through terrorism financing.However, the Lahore high court on Saturday set aside the trial court's conviction in the case against the six JuD leaders after noting that the prosecution “failed to prove the charge against the appellants beyond reasonable doubt”.A court official told news agency PTI that the Lahore high court division bench, comprising Chief Justice Muhammad Ameer Bhatti and Justice Tariq Saleem Sheikh, allowed the petition of the JuD leaders after observing that “the statement of the ‘star prosecution witness’ is not reliable as there is no corroboratory evidence”.The defence counsel, representing the JuD leaders, told the high court that the Al-Anfaal Trust, of which the petitioners were members, has no “nexus with the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).” Although the prosecution argued that the trust in question was working as a “proxy for the LeT” and that the appellants were office-bearers of the trust, the allegations were dismissed by the court.Hafiz Saeed has been named by the United States as a specially designated global terrorist, offering a $10-million reward for information since 2012. Earlier, Saeed was listed as a terrorist under the UN Security Council Resolution in 2008.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pak-court-acquits-6-leaders-of-hafiz-saeed-s-banned-jud-outfit-the-charges-explained-101636257785236.html
07-11-2021||India||National Cancer Awareness Day 2021: History and significance of November 7||November 7 is observed annually as National Cancer Awareness Day in India to raise awareness about cancer, of which 1.1 million cases are reported in the country each year. National Cancer Awareness Day was first announced in September 2014 by then Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan, with November 7 chosen for the occasion to coincide with the birth anniversary of Nobel laureate Marie Curie, who was born on this date in 1867, and whose works led to the development of radiotherapy to treat cancer.An important step in the country's fight against this deadly disease began in 1975, with the launch of National Cancer Control Programme, which was rolled out to provide cancer treatment facilities in the nation. 10 years later, in 1984-85, the scheme's vision was revised to focus on early detection and prevention of cancer.Hence, on November 7 every year, people are encouraged to visit hospitals, Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) centres, and municipal clinics for free cancer screening. The day also sees circulation of booklets and leaflets to raise awareness among the masses on detection of early symptoms and prevention of cancer.In India, the need for early detection of this disease stems from the fact that a large number of cases are those in which it is detected in the patient when it is already at an advanced stage, thus reducing the chances of survival. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), cancer is a leading cause of death globally, accounting for nearly 10 million fatalities in 2020. Cancer in lungs, colon and rectum, liver, stomach and breast, respectively, was the most common cause of death due to the disease, last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/national-cancer-awareness-day-history-and-significance-of-november-7-101636255735691.html

07-11-2021||India||TDP plans protests over rising fuel prices across Andhra on November 9||Telugu Desam Party, the main opposition party in Andhra Pradesh, will hold dharnas at all petrol bunks in the state on November 9 demanding that the YS Jagan Mohan Reddy reduce the Value Added Tax on petrol and diesel in the state.“The party cadres will take part in a one-hour dharna at all petrol bunks in the state from 12 noon to 1 pm on November 9, demanding that the state government cut the fuel prices in the state. The chief minister should fulfil his pre-election promise to make petrol and diesel prices in the state lowest in the country,” TDP president and former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu told reporters on Friday.At present, the Andhra Pradesh government has been collecting a VAT of 31 per cent and 22.25 per cent on petrol and diesel respectively, besides fixed charges of ₹3.07 on petrol and ₹2.76 on diesel.The TDP chief said the Central government had reduced fuel prices by ₹5 on petrol and ₹10 on diesel. Later, many other states positively responded by cutting rates from their share to offer relief to the people. “But the Jagan government is not at all responding,” he said.Naidu recalled that during the last assembly elections, Jagan had promised to bring down the prices of petrol and diesel and make them the lowest in the country. “He had misled the people during the pre-election meetings saying that the people were crossing the border to buy cheaper petrol in Karnataka. Now, there is clear proof to show that the fuel in AP is costlier by ₹10.42 on petrol and ₹12 on diesel per litre, when compared with Bengaluru,” he pointed out.Comparing the fuel rates in AP with other major cities, he said the price was higher by ₹16.75 per litre on petrol and ₹16.10 in Andhra when compared with Chandigarh, and by ₹15.70 on petrol and ₹10.20 on diesel when compared with Lucknow.“Jagan now owes an explanation to the public why the fuel rates are still the highest in the country,” he said and demanded that the government should now cut the fuel rates by ₹16 to ₹17 per litre on both petrol and diesel to make the prices in the state the lowest in the country.The TDP chief said his party would also highlight the problems faced by the people due to bad roads and lack of road safety. “The road conditions in the state are so bad that it takes five to six hours to cover a certain distance, which could be normally covered in an hour,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tdp-plans-protests-over-rising-fuel-prices-across-andhra-on-november-9-101636224389018.html

She alleged that she was supposed to complete her PhD in 2015, but it was prolonged due to the intervention of Nandakumar. She also alleged that he often verbally abused her and behaved rudely, and was singled out because she was the only Dalit among PhD students.The action was taken by university vice-chancellor Sabu Thomas after the intervention of Kerala higher education minister R Bindhu. Earlier, the minister said the government will look into allegations raised by the scholar. Mohanan had joined MG University for a doctorate ten years ago after completing her masters in medical microbiology.“We will help her complete the PhD. She will be given a fee concession, and a lab facility will be available to her. She will also be provided with a new guide. The research centre’s authority will be taken away from Nandakumar, and it will be vested with the VC,” the university said in a statement.The statement also said Dr Nandakumar, who is abroad now, denied all charges and said she was making wild allegations after she failed to meet mandatory provisions of a research scholar. “Her period was extended twice still she failed to finish it on time,” it said. But Mohanan said she was denied access to the lab and other facilities deliberately, which delayed the whole process. Many Dalit bodies have extended support to her.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/varsity-head-of-dept-removed-amid-casteist-slur-allegations-in-kerala-101636224387767.html
07-11-2021||India||BJP MLA’s proposal to name circle after Savarkar stirs row||A proposal by Karnataka BJP MLA Bharath Shetty to rename a well-known circle in Mangaluru after Savarkar has stirred controversy as the Opposition has strongly opposed the idea. The proposal was made by the MLA from Mangaluru North constituency before the committee on town planning and during a city council meeting. While he has gathered support from his party, the Opposition has been up in arms, with the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) warning the MLA of district-wide protests if the proposal goes through. Talking to the media, Shetty defended his decision claiming that he is unable to understand why naming a circle after a freedom fighter should be a matter of concern. “Savarkar was a freedom fighter who fought for our freedom and dedicated his life for this cause. I don’t understand why he is a controversial figure, even the former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had said good things about him,” said the MLA. Adding that Savarkar was an inspiration from many other freedom fighters, Shetty said that Savarkar was the only freedom fighter, who spent time in Kalapani prisons twice. “He lived his entire life for us, not for himself. We cannot forget people who lived their life only for us,” Shetty said. He accused the SDPI and Congress of having a prejudice against the leader. “Their opposition is politically motivated and because of wrong preconceptions. The proposal (to rename the circle) is going as per the legal process, and we will go ahead with it,” he said. The Opposition leaders however claimed that naming the junction after someone who is involved in the conspiracy to murder Mahatma Gandhi will not be tolerated. Congress compotator AC Vinayaraj said that BJP leaders need to refer to the history books. “Savarkar was part of the conspiracy to murder Gandhiji. We will also accept a person who helped Godse kill the father of the nation. He also wrote three letters to the British apologizing for an early release,” said the corporator. SDPI corporator Muneeb Bengre told the media: “We have already discussed the issue in the party meeting. If the Surthkal junction is named after Savarkar, we will take legal action against it. We will also hold district-wide protests. I will also oppose this in the next town planning standing committee meeting.” On September 8, 2020, then Karnataka chief minister B S Yediyurappa inaugurated a flyover in the city named Savarkar, despite opposition from the Congress and JD(S) to name it after him. The 400-meter long flyover, constructed for ₹34 crores by city civic body Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike, is on the Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan Road at Yelahanka.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjpmlas-proposal-to-name-circle-after-savarkar-stirs-row-101636224331254.html
07-11-2021||India||Bitcoin fraud accused detained in Bengaluru||Bengaluru police on Saturday detained Sri Krishna, a hacker and prime accused in the Karnataka Bitcoin scam after he was involved in a brawl inside a five-star hotel in the city, an official said. Sri Krishna was arrested in November 2018 in the cryptocurrency case, and two months ago, was released on bail by the sessions court. The police said that as per the information they got, Sri Krishna was found quarrelling with one Vishnu Bhat and a security guard at the hotel. Police further said that statements from the complainants are being recorded, and further action will be taken based on them. The 26-year-old was caught from Bengaluru on November 18 after the police arrested a couple of drug dealers to whom Sri Krishna had allegedly sold drugs procured from the dark web. A senior police officer said that Sri Krishna graduated in computer science from a college in Amsterdam in the Netherlands in 2017 and would encrypt data and demand payment from owners to unlock the site. “After returning from Amsterdam, he could not find any job in Bengaluru. Then, he started hacking gaming websites and other websites to steal data. He also used to create mirror sites and get information on credit or debit cards used by people who accessed the sites to steal money,” an official said. The police said Sai Krishna used online gaming platforms with chat boxes to communicate with buyers of data, but most times, Sri Krishna allegedly walked up to people on the road and asked them if he could use their phone as he had lost his. “He would tell them he had to get in touch with someone urgently and download the Wickr app on the stranger’s phone.” Wickr is an encrypted messaging app, which also has a ‘burn-on-read’ setting, where the recipient will have access to the message only for a limited time. While it seemed like another cyber-crime case, an Enforcement Directorate (ED) probe into the case 11 months after his arrest snowballed into a political controversy, with the Opposition accusing the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of a cover-up. Opposition leader Siddaramaiah told the media that two influential politicians were involved in the case, and there was an attempt to cover up their role in the case. “There is information about the involvement of influential politicians of Karnataka in Drugs and Bitcoin scam. It is concerning that the investigating officers are trying to close the case to help those politicians,” Siddaramaiah tweeted on October 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bitcoin-fraud-accused-detained-in-bengaluru-101636224327792.html

The Sringeri Math, personally for me, has been a refined symbol of inter-faith harmony,” Gowda noted. The 12 feet tall statue, weighing 28 tons, has been installed on a rebuilt samadhi of Sankaracharya at Kedarnath, an important Hindu pilgrimage centre in the Himalayas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-pm-gowda-lauds-modi-for-new-statue-at-kedarnath-101636224267698.html
07-11-2021||India||Kerala gold smuggling case accused Suresh walks out of jail after 16 months||Main accused of the Kerala gold smuggling case Swapna Suresh on Saturday walked out of the women’s prison here on bail after spending 16 months behind bars. Swapna wasn’t available for an immediate comment as her mother, Prabha S Suresh, told reporters that she wasn’t keeping well. “Swapna is not keeping well. She will meet you all on another day,” said Prabha, after journalists waited outside the jail and then her home expecting Swapna to speak. Earlier, Prabha had said the former United Arab Emirates (UAE) consulate in Thiruvananthapuram was innocent and “influential people made her a pawn in their scheme of things”. The Kerala high court granted bail to Swapna on November 2 after it held that the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) can’t be applied in the smuggling case filed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA). Her release was delayed due to strict bail provisions. Earlier, she was granted bail in cases filed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in December 2020 and Customs in March this year. The high court also quashed Cofeposa (Conservation of foreign exchange and prevention of smuggling activities act 1974) imposed on her on October 10. She is currently facing six charges, including one for allegedly forging her educational qualifications. The gold smuggling case surfaced in July 2020 after the seizure of 30kg gold worth ₹15 crores hidden in bathroom fittings in one of the consignments camouflaged as diplomatic baggage in the UAE consulate here. NIA took over the case a week laterand arrested Suresh along with her accomplice Sandeep Nair from their hideout in Bengaluru. Five central agencies are probing the case now -- NIA, ED, DRI, Customs and Income Tax. When the case surfaced, Swapna was employed at the Space Park of the government-controlled Kerala State Information Technology Infrastructure Limited. Before this, she was employed at the consulate as the secretary of the consulate in charge and became close to many political leaders during this tenure. After smuggling cases came up, her B Com degree was also found to be fake, and police registered a separate forgery case against her. The smuggling case invited enough embarrassment to the left front government after chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s principal secretary M Sivasankar, a senior IAS officer, was arrested by the ED due to his alleged closeness to Swapna, and the dollar smuggling case surfaced. Later, he secured bail from the high court. The Union and state governments locked horns on several occasions over the case, and the latter even constituted a judicial commission against the ED in May 2020, a first of its sort, alleging a bid to implicate many, including CM Vijayan. In August this year, the high court stayed the commission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-gold-smuggling-case-accused-suresh-walks-out-of-jail-after-16-months-101636224208069.html
07-11-2021||India||Karnataka: A name centuries in the making, stamped in ’73||While former chief minister D. Devaraj Urs is credited with renaming the Mysore state as Karnataka on November 1, 1973, historians and writers claim the name itself is centuries old. With the inclusion of the districts from erstwhile Nizam’s Hyderabad and Bombay presidency, many had felt the need to change the state’s name since districts from Mysore were just a part of the new state. It was then, in a large ceremony, Urs announced the new name. One of the strongest arguments regarding the name Karnataka is around the Vijayanagara Empire. Even though the Vijayanagara Empire is known as one of the largest empires in the state, historians argue that it was known as the ‘Karnataka Desha’. According to historian Vasundhara Filliozat’s works, several inscriptions show that the Karnataka Empire was founded in 1336. It was part of an attempt to bring all of south India together. The efforts began during the Hoysala ruler, Ballala III era, and by the time of king Harihara I, it started becoming a reality. It was eventually known as the Vijayanagara Empire, according to the colonial historical accounts. “Based on inscriptions and iconography I studied for nearly a decade, the kingdom then was called Karnataka Desha. It is unclear why colonial historians glossed over the fact that the region was known as Karnataka and why post-Independence historians blindly followed these accounts,” Filliozat said. Many historians argue that the empire was never called Vijayanagara. Even though the kingdom was known as Karnataka Desha, historians chose to follow the colonial accounts. They argue that there is a need to start referring to the Vijayanagara empire as Karnataka Desha.Late Jnanpith Awardee and playwright Girish Karnad refers to the Vijayanagara region as “Karnataka Desha” in his play ‘Rakshasa-Tangadi’, which is based on A Social History of the Deccan, 1300-1761 by Richard M Eaton of the University of Arizona. Historians argue that while recognizing the name Karnataka Desha for the Vijayanagara Empire wouldn’t be a hard task for the government, the question is how much of the state’s history, which is based on colonial accounts, needs a relook. “This is not just about recognizing the fact that name Karnataka is an extension of the state’s heritage of having one of the largest and prosperous empires of the state, but there must be a need to have accurate history presented to the people, without the burden of the colonial history. The question is that if the state was not named Karnataka in 1973, would we have forgotten the name Karnataka, which once stood for one of the most prosperous empires in the country?” asked a senior history professor with a major university, who didn’t want to be named. There are several other arguments regarding the derivation of the Karnataka, with one group suggesting the name was derived from words ‘Karu and Nadu’, which mean elevated land. Another group of scholars has argued that the name came from ‘Karu Nadu’, which means the land of black soil. It is even argued that the name came from ‘Kabu Nadu’, which means the land of sugarcanes. While epidemiology remains a contested topic, the name Karnataka existing for centuries is not contested. Late author UR Ananthamurthy, in his writings, said that the word ‘Kannada Desha’ (the land of Kannada) is written in the Kavirajamarga, which is the earliest known literary work in Kannada. According to Ananthamurthy, who studied Kavirajamarga extensively, from Cauvery to the Godavari, where Kannada was spoken extensively, the land was termed as ‘Kannada Desha’. It was probably one of the earliest instances of defining a land by the language spoken by the locals. Kannada Desha eventually became Karnataka Desha, he argues. “If you go beyond historic data, the mythological epics have the name Karnataka mentioned it. The earliest mention of Karnataka can be found in the great Sanskrit work Mahabharata. The name Karnataka could be found in Bhishma Parva and Sabha Parva. Also, ancient Sanskrit plays like Mrcchakatika by Shudraka cite the word Karnataka,” said Pradeep Koppal, a researcher on Karnataka history. He also added that in the 5th century, astrologer Varaha Mihira used the term Karnataka in his work Brihatkath, and the Birur copper plate inscription of Kadamba dynasty king Vishnuvarma called king Shantivarma “the master of the entire Karnataka region”. “In the 7th century, Rashtrakuta inscriptions refer to the armies of Chalukyas of Badami as ‘Karnatakabala’,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-a-name-centuries-in-the-making-stamped-in-73-101636224147642.html
07-11-2021||India||Many parents reluctant to get children vaccinated against Covid: Study||Only 33.5% parents were willing to vaccinate their children for Covid-19, according to a pre-print study based on an online survey by researchers from Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education & Research (PGIMER-Chandigarh) and Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education & Research (JIPMER-Puducherry) among others. The key reasons for reluctance among parents were concerns about safety and effectiveness (86.4%) and side effects (78.2%), and the fact children tend to have a milder disease (52.8%), according to the responses of 770 parents from across the country. The findingers were uploaded on the pre-print medical research server medRxiv. The researchers also found that the parents’ willingness to get their child vaccinated was linked to their own willingness to get it and their level of education, according to the study. “Factors such as newness of vaccine, their rapid development and unknown long-term side effects influence parent’s perception of vaccine safety and their intention to get themselves and their children vaccinated. Health care providers play a key role in influencing decision of parents towards vaccine acceptance and uptake,” the study said. India has so far approved the a DNA vaccine ZyCoV-D -- which is the first coronavirus vaccine using this vector -- for children between the ages of 12 to 18 years. An expert committee has also cleared the indigenously developed Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin for use in children between the ages of 2 to 18 years. But ZyCoV-D is yet to be rolled out, and Covaxin’s use in children us yet to be cleared by the apex drug controller. “It is an online survey-based study and it shows that parents are apprehensive about vaccination. Besides, children have mild symptoms and the mortality is low. The vaccines are to prevent even the one death that might happen,” said Dr Ritesh Singh from the department of community medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Kalyani. Experts, however, say that it is not essential to vaccinate the very young children against the infection. Dr Suneela Garg, professor in the department of community medicine at Maulana Azad Medical College and a member of the Lancet Commission on Covid-19 in India, said: “This is probably a reflection of what experts have always been saying – It is not necessary to vaccinate the very young children. It should be given only to those between the ages of 12 to 18 years, especially those with co-morbidities. The young children have less ACEII receptors (which is used by the Sars-CoV-2 virus to enter human cells) and hence have only mild disease when infected.” She said, “Now, through sero-surveys we know that children are infected at the same rate as adults. And, the natural infection provides much better immunity than vaccines. What is worth noting is that parents have already started sending their children to schools, which means they have accepted the risk of a mild infection. The fear has gone down.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/many-parents-reluctant-to-get-children-vaccinated-against-covid-study-101636223908079.html
07-11-2021||India||‘Will chop off hands’: BJP MP to Congress after Haryana protesters hold ex-minister hostage||Attacking the Congress over some of his party leaders being held hostage in Rohtak district, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Arvind Sharma on Saturday threatened to “gouge out the eyes and chop off the hands” of anyone who opposed party colleague and former Haryana minister Manish Grover. The Rohtak MP’s remarks came a day after Grover, who is also the vice-president of the state BJP, and 42 others were confined for at least five hours to a temple as farmers staged a protest outside. The BJP on Saturday held a protest in the district against the Congress, blaming it for the Friday incident. Addressing the gathering, Sharma attacked Congress leaders Bhupinder Singh Hooda and his son, Deepender Hooda, alleging that Grover was being targeted as Deepender lost the Lok Sabha elections because of him.“Congress workers held our leaders hostage yesterday. This is a frustration of Bhupinder Singh Hooda and his son, Deepender, for losing the Lok Sabha polls. I can say that we won the Rohtak Lok Sabha seat due to Manish Grover,” he said. “The Congress and Deepender Hooda should listen that if anyone dares to look towards Manish Grover, then we will take their eyes out. If they try to put their hands on him, their hands will be chopped off,” he added. Continuing his attack on the Hooda family, Sharma said: “The days of the Hooda family are gone and they are confined in some areas of Rohtak and Jhajjar. Some people of these areas are backing them with a hope that he will become the chief minister again but this is not going to happen because the BJP will rule in Haryana for the next 25 years.” Recalling Friday’s incident, Grover alleged that he was sitting in the temple complex to watch the live telecast of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s speech at Kedarnath temple around 11 am when he was approached by three youths. “The youths said this is Manish Grover, who is responsible for Deepender Hooda’s defeat in the Lok Sabha polls and this is a right time to teach him a lesson. My colleagues and party workers asked me to leave the temple as the situation got tense but I refused. With the support of my party workers and Khap representatives, we returned home safely,” he alleged.Criticising the BJP MP’s remarks, Congress’ chief whip in Haryana assembly and Rohtak MLA BB Batra said: “How can an elected MP threaten people to chop-off their hands? This is clearly a violation of law and order and the police should take cognisance of the matter. The BJP leaders’ low-level statement shows that they have no faith in democracy and if anyone tried to take them hostage, they should file a complaint before the police. The BJP leaders want to rule with sticks,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-chop-off-hands-bjp-mp-to-congress-after-haryana-protesters-hold-ex-minister-hostage-101636223736520.html

07-11-2021||India||Anil Deshmukh sent to 14-day judicial custody in money laundering case||A special holiday court on Saturday remanded former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh in 14-day judicial custody in connection with an alleged money laundering case. The move came after the court rejected a plea of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to extend the custody of the 72-year-old National Congress Party (NCP) leader with them by nine more days. Deshmukh was arrested by the central agency, under provisions of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) on November 2, after 12 hours of questioning. A court had remanded him in ED custody till November 6, following which he was sent to Arthur Road jail in south central Mumbai. Shortly after his medical check-up, the former minister was produced before the court on Saturday -- the last day of his ED custody.Appearing for the agency, additional solicitor general Anil Singh submitted that a probe into the matter so far revealed that Deshmukh and his family had direct or indirect control over 27 companies, and used them to launder money by creating a complex web of transactions. The ED’s court application, seeking further custody of the former minister, alleged that money was transferred from bank accounts of Deshmukh’s family to accounts belonging to these companies, and that an amount of ₹9.8 crore was laundered to one these entities – M/s Zodiac Dealcom – through 18 Kolkata-based shell companies.Singh also pointed out that Deshmukh, who they believed was involved in the money laundering, was not cooperating in the probe and was “evasive during questioning”. Opposing the probe agency’s plea, defence counsels Vikram Chaudhri and Aniket Nikam said: “The present remand application is a photocopy of the first remand application. The investigation by the agency seems to not have progressed at all... the same grounds are shown to seek further custody of Deshmukh. Besides, the grounds are vague.” The two lawyers also pointed out that Deshmukh had appeared before the agency to prove his bona fide. The agency has attached some of his assets purchased in 2005 and 2006, alleging that they were purchased while Deshmukh was the home minister, they said. The ED was stretching its probe “way beyond the scope of the allegations against him”, they added. The central agency had registered the money-laundering case against Deshmukh on May 11 on the basis of an First Information Report (FIR) filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on April 21 following allegations of corruption levelled by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh.In a letter to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on March 20, Singh alleged that Deshmukh had instructed certain Mumbai Police officers to collect an amount of ₹100 crore every month from restaurants and bars in the state capital. The probe agency claimed that the money was sent to Delhi-based Jain brothers who reportedly operated bogus companies using hawala channels. The Jain brothers reportedly diverted this money as donations to Nagpur-based Shri Sai Shikshan Sansthan, a trust controlled by the Deshmukh family. The ED suspects that the Jain brothers were acting on the instructions of Deshmukh’s son, Hrishikesh, who has also been summoned for questioning in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-maharashtra-minister-anil-deshmukh-sent-to-14-day-judicial-custody-in-money-laundering-case-101636223427749.html

The move came after four Delhi-based advocates were booked under UAPA and some other charges of the Indian Penal Code for allegedly sharing fake information on social media. In a letter written to Twitter recently, the state police requested to block at least 68 accounts for posting allegedly distorted and objectionable news on the platform regarding communal violence in the state. The police claimed in the letter that some of the published news items or posts on these social media handles had some photographs or videos of some other incidents or fabricated statements to promote enmity between religious communities through a criminal conspiracy. A case was lodged in this regard at West Agartala Police Station under Section 153A, 153B, 469,471,503,504,120B of the Indian Penal Code and Section 13 of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act. “ ...some persons/ organization are publishing/ posting distorted and objectionable news items / statements in Twitter regarding the recent clash and alleged attack upon mosques of Muslim communities in the state. In publishing these news items/ posts, the persons / organizations have been found using photographs / videos of some other incidents, fabricated statements / commentary for promoting enmity between religious groups / communities in presence of criminal conspiracy, “ the letter said. On the issue, a senior police official on the condition of anonymity said that the letter was written following registration of a case against these posts. These cases have been forwarded to the Crime Branch for investigation. “ 102 social media account holders were booked and we sent letters to these platforms to block after some distorted news items on Tripura incidents were posted on these platforms. There might be 68 profiles on Twitter but there are accounts on other platforms where such distorted posts were shared, “ said the official. Police earlier booked 71 persons for allegedly spreading rumours on social media on communal violence incidents in the state days after a mosque and a few houses and shops were vandalised and two shops were burnt at two separate places in Panisagar of North district. Police arrested at least four persons involved in the incident and said that no mosque was burnt and pictures of a burning mosque uploaded on social media were not from Tripura. The police appealed to people to refrain from retweeting or liking any provocative posts as it amounts to rumour mongering. Some allegedly fake news were circulated on social media regarding vandalism of a mosque at Kakraban area in Gomati district. On the issue, the police tweeted, “This is a complete misrepresentation of facts. The mosque in Dargabazar area of Kakraban is completely fine & Gomati police is working to maintain peace and tranquillity.” The National Human Rights Commission sought an action taken report from the state government regarding the violence in Panisagar following a complaint filed by All India Trinamool Congress national spokesperson Saket Gokhale. The Tripura high court has also taken suo motu cognisance and sought a detailed report from the state by November 10.CPM veteran leader Pabitra Kar said, “One should not share any controversial posts on social media that can flare up communal tension. But the government cannot ask to block someone’s social media handles.”BJP spokesperson Nabendu Bhattacharya said, “ If they are guilty, police will take action against them. Freedom of speech and expression is a must in the country but the freedom has some restrictions or else, it will be misused.”The Chief Minister’s Office declined to comment on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tripura-police-book-102-social-media-accounts-under-uapa-after-violence-101636223313873.html

07-11-2021||India||During Covid, urban poor hit most by inflation, show studies||Inflation, often described as the cruellest tax because it erodes income, has been falling in recent months, but average price rise during and following the peak of the pandemic has been higher and more broad-based than in previous years, hitting the urban poor harder, two recent studies have shown.Three components of inflation — food, fuel and core inflation i.e. price in all items minus food and fuel — have moved divergently. Food inflation fell significantly from above 5% at the start of the current financial year to 0.7% in September. During the same period, fuel inflation rose from 8% to 13.6%. Core inflation, which leaves out volatile items such as food and fuel, remained sticky near 6%.“Not only did they (inflation in various components) diverge, but their burden also varied by income group, primarily because the share of spending on each of these commodity groups differs across income classes,” said Dharmakirti Joshi, chief economist, Crisil.The bottom line of this is that although broadly everyone experienced the same inflation numbers, some groups – especially the urban poor – felt inflation’s heat more because they spend a larger share of their budgets on items that got costlier, such as fuel.According to the Reserve Bank’s bi-annual Monetary Policy Report for October, mean or average inflation this year has been higher and more broad-based. It has also been very volatile.“These indicate high dispersion of inflation rates in the consumer price index basket, along with a larger number of items experiencing higher inflation rates than in the pre-pandemic period,” the RBI report said.Crisil’s researchers engaged in an interesting study to disaggregate the impact of inflation on different income groups.They segregated the population into three broad groups by expenditure — the bottom 20%, the middle 60% and the top 20% for urban and rural — using data from the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO).Then, the expenditure share of each commodity group was mapped with the relevant inflation during the last and this fiscal up to September 2021. They then used these weights to calculate the overall inflation for each class.“We find that the urban poor felt the heat of inflation the most,” Joshi said.While overall inflation declined for all income classes in FY2021-22 compared with the last fiscal year, urban poor (bottom 20%) bore the heaviest brunt in both time periods.The key culprits were fuel and food costs, which have the highest weights for the bottom 20% of the urban poor. Urban inflation in these two commodity components was higher than that in rural areas.The researchers used the NSSO’s Consumer Expenditure Survey of 2011-12, which offers the latest available data on monthly per capita expenditure (MPCE) across income classes. This data have also been used to calculate weights for the latest consumer price index 2011-12 series.“The relatively higher food and fuel inflation in urban areas have meant the poor in that geography are facing more heat than their rural counterparts,” according to the Crisil Ltd’s study.The rural poor did face considerable inflationary pressures too, the study shows. Cereals, fuel and vegetables are the top three spending categories within food for both rural and urban dwellers. The pressure from high fuel inflation may have been offset by lower price rise in food.However, six out of the 10 commodities have seen inflation above 6% in rural areas this fiscal, Crisil observed.

In a historic achievement on October 21, India achieved administering over one billion Covid-19 vaccine doses. On November 6, the cumulative number of vaccinations jumped to 1,079,219,546.Khara said the kind of vaccine drive India has seen makes all Indians proud, especially because the country is using the domestically produced vaccine in a big way, the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) said, quoting him. Ficci is one of the partners in the India Pavilion.The chairman of India’s largest bank said the country has lived through one of the most challenging times and has come out of it in a very successful manner that gives the confidence that going forward, the journey should be rather easy and there will be huge opportunity for growth in the country.In its latest edition of Economy Watch, EY India chief policy adviser DK Srivastava said: “As per the October 2021 issue of IMF’s World Economic Outlook, the Indian economy is poised to become the global growth leader FY22 onwards. Not only does it overtake China among major economies in FY22 but it is projected to retain this position for the next five years.”High-frequency indicators confirm that economic recovery is gathering momentum, he said. India’s Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections, a weathervane of business activities, soared to ₹1.3 lakh crore in the month of October, the second highest ever. Latest data also shows the Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for manufacturing in the month of October at 55.9, the highest since February.Speaking about the growth prospects, Khara said he is sure that the confidence in the Indian economy would go a long way in terms of meeting the common man’s aspirations.While visiting the India Pavilion at EXPO2020 Dubai, the SBI chairman said the pavilion is presenting the real India, which is full of opportunities, to the whole world in an impressive manner.He said that the pandemic had a devastating impact on businesses, but the Indian economy is witnessing rapid recovery. “The credit growth in the economy was quite muted for almost two years. I am sure now with this confidence, the capacity utilisation will improve, and with the capacity utilisation improving, there will be a revival of investment demand for the corporate sector,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-vaccination-drive-makes-all-citizens-proud-sbi-chairman-dinesh-kumar-khara-at-dubai-expo-101636221216045.html
