14-11-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab Cong leader Sidana may join SAD||Chandigarh Days after Congress leader Raman Behl joined the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), party’s Punjab unit intellectual cell chairman Anish Sidana, a senior leader from the Hindu community, appears set to leave the party. Sidana, a member of the Kandi Area Development Board (KADB) till a few months ago, is likely to join the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) along with several of his associates. “He has already had a few rounds of meetings with SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal and is tentatively scheduled to join the party this week,” said sources close to the Congress leader. The intellectual cell chairman’s exit, if it goes according to plan, will be a setback for the ruling party, which is already facing the challenge of retaining its Hindu leaders. The rival parties, SAD and AAP, have also started making efforts to woo its Hindu and OBC leaders. On November 9, Behl had joined the AAP, which has been looking to expand its base in Majha, after resigning from the post of chairman of Punjab Subordinate Services Selection Board. In June, former MLA Ashwani Sekhri was to join the SAD, but changed his mind at the last minute after Congress leaders reached out to him. Sidana, who belongs to Jalalabad and remained opposed to Sukhbir in the past, has been from time to time voicing his concerns regarding their lack of adequate representation. On October 31, Sidana, in an “open letter” to Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi, raised the issues of neglect of leaders of these communities, lack of consultation with dedicated workers and indiscipline in the party. Six months ago, he had resigned from KADB over some of these issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-cong-leader-sidana-may-join-sad-101636914551964.html

14-11-2021||Chandigarh||Warring launches ‘No Challan Day’ road safety campaign||Punjab transport minister Amarinder Singh Raja Warring launched the statewide ‘No Challan Day’, a road safety campaign, on the occasion of Children’s Day from Jalandhar on Sunday. The campaign was simultaneously organised at 100 locations across the state in collaboration with the police department, Punjab Youth Congress, National Students’ Union of India (NSUI) Punjab, Mahila Congress, besides NGOs taking an active part in disseminating traffic and road awareness among commuters. Traffic violators were administered a pledge instead of being issued a challan between 10am to 12 noon to sensitise them towards their own safety and of others travelling on the road.Speaking on the occasion, Warring said every life lost in accidents is a loss for the nation. “Let us all today on the Children’s Day vow to make our state safest for our children and let us start it with roads,” said the minister while making an emotional appeal to citizens to adopt traffic compliance into their day to day behaviour.Launching the campaign, Warring expressed concern over the average high rate of road fatalities in the state and directed the department to ensure the strictest implementation of low and safe speed limits within school areas to ensure the safety of children.“Punjab loses 10-12 precious lives every day in road crashes, which is a serious cause of concern. It would be highly regrettable if we do not act now to ensure a safe road environment for our kids, the collective onus of which falls on all of us. It starts with you and me at home and from our schools to make our children vigilant about traffic rules,” he said. Warring said under the leadership of chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi and state Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu, the party will secure a thumping victory in the forthcoming assembly elections. He also attacked former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh for colluding with the Badals in the “loot” of Punjab’s resources.‘Capt was a compromised CM‘Ludhiana Amrinder Singh Raja Warring termed Captain Amarinder Singh a “compromised chief minister” at an event in Ludhiana. He said Captain Amarinder had a secret pact with the BJP and the SAD and helped them regaining lost ground in the state. “I have a hunch that it was all planned. The formation of a new party, announcing an alliance with the BJP and then trying to please farmers by saying that he (Captain Amarinder ) had a word with Prime Minister Narendra Modi over repealing the three farm laws. But people will not forget the death of over 650 farmers at protest sites,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/warring-launches-no-challan-day-road-safety-campaign-101636914372701.html

According to official data, the district has a target of vaccinating 2,702,167 beneficiaries, of whom 2,296,012 people have received at least the first dose till November 13. The first dose coverage is about 84.97%.  The second dose coverage is about 43.08% with 1,164,119 beneficiaries jabbed with both the doses of Covid-19. “The government has given us a target of covering all the eligible beneficiaries with the first dose by November, we are aiming to meet this target by November 15. If there are still some beneficiaries left out, we will adopt different measures to administer the first vaccine dose to them,” said Dr Bhavtosh Shankhdhar, chief medical officer of Ghaziabad. Officials of the district health department said they are taking different measures to increase the vaccination coverage. “We will achieve this target in all probabilities. During the festive season, the turnout at the vaccination centres was low but it will pick up now. Our door-to-door survey is already in place, as part of which our teams are trying to find out those who have still not taken a single vaccine dose and encouraging them to take the jab,” said Dr GP Mathuria, nodal officer for Covid vaccination. “We are also running vaccination drives in the evening at 17-18 locations everyday for the convenience of working professionals. Our daily vaccine allocation has also increased from 23,000 to 33,000. Hence, we are hoping to achieve the first dose target in the next couple of days,” said Dr Mathuria. Data from the health department shows it has completed administering the first vaccine dose to all the beneficiaries identified under the ‘healthcare workers’ and ‘frontline workers’ categories. The first dose coverage for the 18-45 years age group is about 85.48% while it is 92.14% for the 45+ age group category. Experts said that now is the right time to get both the vaccine doses. “Since the Covid cases are very less and have considerably declined, it is vital that beneficiaries get vaccinated at the earliest,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, former president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad chapter). According to official figures, till Saturday morning (November 13), the overall tally of Covid-19 cases in the district stood at 55,676, of which three are active cases.

14-11-2021||Noida||Noida: Residents want sound barriers to curb noise pollution||Residents having houses along Noida’s first elevated road cannot enjoy sound sleep because of noise and vehicular pollution along the area which passes through this road, officials said on Sunday.They demanded a sound barrier and adequate measures as their peace is disturbed, particularly during wee hours. They also demanded a remedy to address this issue, but the Noida authority has not taken any action on this for a long time, said the officials.In June 2017, the Noida authority had opened ₹500 crore budget for the city’s first elevated road for the public use. There is no dense green belt which can work as a buffer zone between the residential areas of sectors 22, 27, 28, 53 and 61, and the 4.8-km-long elevated road. As a result, vehicular pollution and noise keep affecting the health of the people in the residential area.“The biggest trouble is the honking by heavy vehicles which ferry construction materials during the night time. Their unregulated honking during wee hours troubles the residents the most and it is so annoying that we cannot sleep peacefully during this time. We have taken up the matter with the authority officials but nothing has happened till date,” said Atul Gupta, a resident of Noida Sector 28.The elevated road begins from Sector 28 and ends at Sector 61. It is above the Master Plan 2 road which is surrounded by residential areas such as sectors 28, 26, 26, 23, 53 and 61 in Noida.“There are two issues -- noise pollution and air pollution which we are facing. The air is saturated in the morning. The air is so heavy as if it is mixed with oil, and we face this issue perennially. During winters, the issue aggravates further. We are working from home and it is like living in hell here. This road has become a highway, troubling us. Due to farmers blocking the Meerut-Delhi Expressway, Delhi-bound heavy traffic is being diverted towards this road, troubling us even more,” said Rakhi Sinha, another resident of Sector 28.Sector 61 federation of apartment associations has written to Noida MLA Pankaj Singh, and the Noida authority demanding action on this issue, but nothing has happened so far. “The elevated road and service lane facing our sector remains congestion ridden daily, during the peak hours, thereby, leading to air pollution and noise pollution. We hope the authority will act on this issue,” said Namit Gautam, general secretary of association -- an umbrella body of the apartment complexes.The Noida authority’s chief general manager, Rajiv Tyagi, said, “We will look into the issue and act appropriately. We are yet to receive any proposal on the issue. Let the proposal from residents’ come and we will address the issue.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-residents-want-sound-barriers-to-curb-noise-pollution-101636913892142.html

14-11-2021||Noida||Air quality improves in Noida, Ghaziabad after a span of 10 days||The air quality for all the three cities significantly improved on Sunday for the first time in the last 10 days since November 5, a day after Diwali from when pollution levels started spiking and the air quality began deteriorating. According to the air quality index (AQI) bulletin of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) , the air quality fell from the ‘severe’ to the ‘very poor’ category on Sunday with Ghaziabad recording an AQI of 331,Greater Noida 310 and Noida 321. The figures indicate that Sunday was the least polluted day for all the three cities since November 4, the day Diwali was celebrated. An AQI reading between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”. The improvement in the air quality on Sunday was a source of relief for Ghaziabad, which has been reeling under the ‘severe’ category for 10 straight days since Diwali. Noida too suffered from ‘severe’ air quality for nine days from November 4 to 13, except on November 10. The air quality in Greater Noida hovered between the upper end of the ‘very poor’ category and the lower end of the ‘severe’ category during this period.According to the CPCB data, the air quality started worsening from November 5 with Noida being the most polluted city in the country on that day with an AQI of 475. The AQI in Ghaziabad stood at 470 while in Greater Noida, it was 464. The three cities witnessed the worst air quality on November 12 with Noida recording an AQI of 488,Ghaziabad 486 and Greater Noida 478.  On Sunday, despite the pollution levels being low, all the four air quality monitoring stations in Ghaziabad and two in Greater Noida recorded PM2.5 as the primary pollutant while the four stations in Noida had both PM10 and PM2.5 as the primary pollutants. According to the figures of the System of air quality and weather forecasting and research (Safar), the share of stubble burning in PM2.5, which peaked to 48% on November 7, drastically dropped to 12% on Sunday. “The AQI today (Sunday) indicates ‘very poor’ category and is likely to improve for the next two days as winds at transport level are slowing down, resulting in lesser intrusion of farm fires related pollutants into Delhi. However, calm local winds reduce dispersion of pollutants. Net effect is likely to make air quality remain (in the) ‘very poor’ category,” said the Safar forecast. Officials of the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board said they are closely monitoring the situation. “The improvement in air quality started since Saturday night. The layers of air above the ground level are slow, resulting in lesser influx of pollutants. We will keep tracking the meteorological conditions in the coming days. The directions given by the sub-committee of the Commission for Air Quality Management have been forwarded to the different departments,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB. The committee, during its meeting on November 13, observed that PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations have come down below the standard limits. According to CPCB data, the PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations breeched the standard limits on two days since Diwali--November 5 and 12. In view of the prevailing situation, the committee has now directed the states and agencies to be ready to implement ‘emergency measures’ listed under the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap). It asked agencies to ensure uninterrupted power supply to discourage the use of generator sets, stopping the use of diesel generator sets (except for emergency purposes), increasing the parking fee,stopping the of use of coal/firewood in hotels and open eateries and stringently enforce/stop garbage burning in landfills and other places among other measures. Residents said that given the prevailing conditions, they are taking extra precautions and staying indoors as much as possible. “The impact of pollution can be felt even inside our homes. I am running three air purifiers at home and have stopped stepping outside. There is considerable difference in breathing, when I move to the other rooms which do not have air purifiers,” said V K Mittal, president of Kaushambi Apartments RWA. Environmentalists said they were expecting better air quality this year due to the restriction on firecrackers. “The situation turned out to be worse as both Noida and Ghaziabad continued to be in ‘severe’ zone for days together since Diwali. The measures to control local sources of pollution lacks sting,” said Akash Vashishtha, an environmentalist from Ghaziabad. According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality early warning system for Delhi, the air quality is likely to deteriorate but remain in the ‘very poor’ category on November 15 and 16. “The outlook for subsequent five days: The air quality is likely to remain in upper end of ‘very poor’ category. PM2.5 to be the predominant pollutant,” said the forecast. It also predicted a shallow to moderate fog in the morning of November 16 due to predominant surface winds that are likely to come from the northwest direction of Delhi at a speed of 4-8 kmph.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/air-quality-improves-in-noida-ghaziabad-after-a-span-of-10-days-101636913593024.html

The increase can be correlated to social gatherings, crowds at shopping areas, and probably the festivals which led to the accumulation of large groups of people and spread of the virus. Most infections we are seeing are breakthrough infections. In fact, most cases are being seen in the people who have already received both the doses of vaccines, and most of the individuals are elderly people.” He said that the intensity of Covid-19 is not of concern because most of the patients are responding well to conventional symptomatic therapy, and not too many complications are being seen. Meanwhile, 1,705 people were vaccinated on Sunday, with 314 people being administered the first dose and 1,391 being administered the second dose. Till now, over 3.68 million people have been vaccinated in Gurugram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/with-11-fresh-cases-gurugram-s-covid-positivity-rate-sees-slight-uptick-101636913531867.html
14-11-2021||Chandigarh||AAP cries foul over Ludhiana deputy commissioner’s transfer||Alleging that deputy commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma had been transferred for not kowtowing to those in power, the district unit of the Aam Aadmi Party on Saturday demanded revocation of the transfer orders. AAP’s Ludhiana in-charge Amandeep Singh Mohi said, “This is a punishment transfer as the DC had not allowed the sale of the land of the Ludhiana Improvement Trust at rates much lower than the market value and for marking an inquiry against a legislator.” We have written to the election commission of India, requested that attempts to dislodge an “honest and upright officer” be thwarted. AAP’s Punjab spokesperson Ahbaab Singh Grewal said AAP will not allow the transfer of an officer who had saved”hundreds of crores of public money. The Congress is planning to replace Sharma with a tainted officer who is facing corruption charges and has no experience with administrative affairs.” APP leaders Gurjit Singh Gill, Madan Laal Bagga and Ashok Prashar (Pappi) said the SAD and Congress were hand in glove with each other in protecting the corrupt and penalising honest officers.On the other hand, Ludhiana improvement trust (LIT) chairman Raman Balasubramaniam slammed the allegations as baseless. “They appear to be uneducated lot .The AAP leader are levelling baseless allegations just to stay relevant. The auction concerned has been cancelled and the matter is pending for hearing in a court of law,” said Balasubramaniam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/aap-cries-foul-over-ludhiana-deputy-commissioner-s-transfer-101636913357528.html
14-11-2021||Gurugram||Crackdown on old polluting vehicles in Gurugram||The traffic police, in a crackdown on polluting diesel vehicles from January to November 14 this year, impounded over 360 vehicles and penalised over 28,000 violators for parking on the wrong side of the road and leaving their ignition on.Police started an extensive drive last Monday to impound old vehicles plying in violation of environmental norms leading to pollution.Orders issued by the National Green Tribunal in 2015, as well as the Supreme Court in 2018, state that diesel vehicles older than 10 years and petrol vehicles older than 15 years cannot ply in the National Capital Region (NCR) due to high levels of air pollution. In July 2016, the Haryana government also passed a similar order, banning such vehicles in Gurugram, Faridabad, Sonepat and Jhajjar districts.Owners of such vehicles were directed to either replace such vehicles or sell them as scrap material. The Gurugram traffic police said they impounded 858 such vehicles from 2018 to November 14, 2021.Gurugram on Sunday recorded an Air Quality Index reading of 287, in the “poor” category.Sanjeev Balhara, assistant commissioner of police (traffic), said that they deployed over 25 teams on highways and internal roads to check diesel vehicles. “We are impounding polluting diesel vehicles every day and heavily penalising people parking vehicles on the wrong side of the roads with the ignition on,” he said.Balhara said parked vehicles with the ignition on lead to a rise in pollution and they penalise over 200 commuters every day. “Our teams are deployed in two shifts and the highway is our prime concern as heavy vehicles add to pollution,” he said.Balhara said that traffic policemen were directed to penalise people with ₹500 for a first-time offence and ₹1,500 for a second-time offence. “Impounded vehicles are parked in the nearest police station and later given away to be scrapped. A fine of ₹5,000 is also generated against the offender on the spot and owners are only returned the vehicles if they agree to scrap them,” he said.Police said the air pollution levels rise in the city as farmers in northern states set their paddy fields afire to remove leftover stubble after harvest to prepare the soil for sowing the next crop. Such is the impact of stubble burning that air quality levels are often 30-35 times higher than the permissible limit across the NCR.Vehicular pollution in the city further compounds problems during winter.Authorities on Friday advised people to limit outdoor activities and told government and private offices to cut vehicle use by at least 30% as air quality in Delhi-NCR inched towards the emergency level amid a rise in emissions from farm fires and unfavourable meteorological conditions.The measures to be followed in the ‘emergency’ situation include stopping the entry of trucks in Delhi, a ban on construction activities and introducing the odd-even car rationing scheme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/crackdown-on-old-polluting-vehicles-in-gurugram-101636913292407.html
14-11-2021||Gurugram||Four held in Faridabad for robbing commuters on highway||Faridabad police on Saturday arrested a gang of four persons allegedly involved in over 100 robberies. Police said they targeted commuters travelling on the highway, stopped them by threatening them with iron rods and wooden sticks and robbed them of their belongings and cash. Police are currently interrogating them and also trying to find out about their involvement in other cases. Police said the men are from Nuh and were jailed for a similar crime earlier. They recovered iron rods, wooden sticks and a torch from the men’s possession. Narender Kadiyan, deputy commissioner of police (crime), said that the police have increased night patrolling in the area and near the highway from where incidents of robberies were being reported. “We deployed a team at night and kept a close watch on the movement of commuters at Faridpur crossing. The team witnessed four men reaching the roadside with sticks and rods and stopping motorists,” he said. The suspects were identified as Rashid Khan, Sazid Khan, Akhlaq and Armaan Khan of Pinagwan, Nuh. Police said they caught the suspects in the act. Kadiyan said the suspects were travelling in a Swift car and had parked it in the middle of the road. “One of the suspects would carry a torch and the other three would threaten the victims with rods and sticks and rob them,” he said.He said that the police team laid a trap and reached the area. The men tried to rob them but after realising they were cops, tried to flee. Police said the men are drug addicts and would gamble with the money they robbed. The suspects had also stolen motorcycles from Faridabad, which police recovered from their possession.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/four-held-in-faridabad-for-robbing-commuters-on-highway-101636912871682.html
14-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi: South MCD forms committee to audit waste management concessionaires||The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) has constituted a committee to probe the billing and auditing of private concessionaires managing municipal waste collection and transportation in its zones. The order to form a panel that will audit records from the last three months, was issued after unanimous approval from the standing committee of the civic body. Col BK Oberoi (retd), the standing committee chairman, said that the committee will also comprise councillors from other zones and Opposition members. Several standing committee members recently highlighted that while the agreement of the local body with the private companies stipulates strong penal provisions and fines in case of violations and absence of mandated machinery/manpower, the department of environment management services (DEMS), or sanitation department, has rarely imposed these provisions.Col Oberoi (retd) said that the municipal commissioner and deputy commissioners have been directed to submit the records from the last three months. “We will look into the issues that are affecting solid waste management. According to the agreement, private concessionaires are expected to have a certain number of garbage collection and transportation vehicles as well as enough manpower. If the vehicles are not present, then the billing should reflect it. We will crosscheck these records with the area councillors and fix accountability,” he said.Tulsi Joshi, standing committee member and representative from RK Puram ward said that in the zonal meetings, a majority of councillors have raised the issue of vehicles breaking down and norms being flouted, but the department has taken no action.Joshi said that according to the agreement’s Clause 108, there is a penalty on non-repair of damaged dhalaos and the sanitation department should submit a list of dhalaos to the company. “We have asked for communications about damaged dhalaos to be submitted to the committee. Moreover, the agreement states that there will be a penalty of ₹500 per day per garbage-lifting rickshaw. Twenty-five units are not working in our zone. Similarly, out of 264 auto-tippers, around 45-50 are non-operational in our zone. There is a penalty of ₹25,000 per day for not cleaning one dhalao. The penalty for our zone alone totals ₹2.6 crore, but such penalties are not being issued despite so many shortfalls,” she said. Suresh Kumar, the municipal councillor from Khanpur, said that he has been facing similar problems.Councillors from Bharatiya Janata Party and Aam Aadmi Party have agreed to form a panel to look into the billing and penalties. The three-member committee will be headed by the standing committee chairperson and will comprise one member each from AAP and BJP. All four zones under SDMC are now managed by private concessionaires, three out of six zones under the north corporation are managed by private companies, and the east corporation has also outsourced garbage collection in both its zones to private companies. BS Vohra, who heads the east Delhi residents’ welfare association (RWA) joint front, said that they have not noticed any change in garbage collection in their area. “The same auto-tipper has been making visits in our area for several years,” Vohra said. Atul Goel, who heads URJA -a collective body of RWAs, said that the accountability in managing waste can’t be fixed unless residents are involved in the oversight mechanism. “An independent committee should probe the shortcomings. We have been arguing for safai nigrani samitis-- local area committees at the ward level which have RWA representation. There should be a structured mechanism to monitor the functioning by default,” he added..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-south-mcd-forms-committee-to-audit-waste-management-concessionaires-101636912571789.html

14-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Relief for tourism sector as flying norms for foreign visitors eased||New Delhi: The Centre’s move to lift restrictions limiting arrival of foreigners on tourist visas to the country only by chartered flights on Monday is expected to give a boost to the tourism industry in the Capital that was hit hard by the Covid pandemic.With little to no business during the past 19 months, stakeholders from the tourism sector are being cautiously optimistic and hoping for a recovery. Ashok Kumar (24), manager at The Grace House hotel in Paharganj, said that due to the pandemic, business was hit as only around 4-5% of foreign tourists were currently coming to India on business and medical visas. He, however, said that it could take another six-seven months for business to bounce back. “We are dependent on foreign tourists and don’t get any domestic revenue. Our business has been nearly zero since March. We are hoping that more foreign tourists will start visiting the country... Our entire staff is fully vaccinated and prepared to welcome guests,” said Kumar, whose hotel is among the hundreds of establishments in the Paharganj main market.Peppered with multiple outlets engaging with tourist affairs -- like hotels, money changers, travel operators, restaurants or handicrafts shops -- the market used to be a go-to place for foreign tourists prior to the pandemic. With foreign tourists being the primary clientele for these outlets, business has been dull here since March last year.When HT visited the market earlier this week, it wore a largely deserted look, with owners sitting idle in shops.Sumit Chadha (45), who runs a handicrafts shop in Paharganj’s main market, said his outlet used to be frequented by many foreign tourists before the pandemic. “Over 70% of our clients are foreigners. Since the [initial] easing of restrictions, around 5-6 foreign clients have come to us. These are clients who have had a long relation with the country and us. Regular tourists are not coming at least as of now,” said Chadha. Reacting to the resumption of tourist visas, he said that the move alone would not be enough to attract tourists at a time when there was a lot of uncertainty regarding Covid. “Something is better than nothing but a lot more needs to be done if we want people to come back. It will be necessary to provide a safe environment and for that, enforcement of Covid norms is crucial. The government could organise a festival to show that the country is open for tourism,” said Chadha. While most stakeholders are hoping that the sector will pick up gradually, the optimism is not shared by everyone. Ajay Suri (56), a money exchanger, said that the pandemic has devastated his family. “There has been no business in the last two years. I had to sell my house to pay for medical bills. There is no income and I only come here because one cannot stay at home forever,” said Suri, who started working in the market at the age of 16. “Don’t trust anyone or any talks about revival now. Business has crashed completely. Till the time all flights are resumed normally, people will not return to India for tourism. Flight tickets are also expensive right now. It will take months for the business to pick up once all restrictions on flights are lifted,” said Suri. Dildar Singh, a city-based government-registered tourist guide, said that it was difficult to predict by when business would pick up. Since the pandemic started, he has only been catering to domestic tourists, many of whom do not prefer to hire the services of guides. “I think it will take some time for tourists to return. They could possibly start coming by December. I have seen a few foreigners working in the Embassy at monuments but other than that the footfall is mostly due to domestic tourists,” said Singh. Historian and author Swapna Liddle said that it was important to expand tourism beyond the popular places in a Covid-impacted world. Liddle said that instead of converging at the few popular sites, one could develop places that are less crowded. “There are many small places in Delhi and beyond which are beautiful and can be developed as tourist places. One simply needs to promote them and send out a message that tourists are welcome. We need to be mindful of covid and not congregate at small places with large crowds,” said Liddle. She added that while businesses were already running, the need of the hour was to instil confidence in visitors and make them believe that safe practices in compliance with covid were being adopted.Sanjeev Kumar, president, Government Approved Tourist Guide Association, Delhi, said that the revival of full-fledged would need a sentimental change which is unlikely to happen so soon. Kumar said that the resumption of tourist visas was only 1% of the efforts that need to be taken for the industry to bounce back. “Things are not changing right now. People do not travel without insurance and right now, insurance companies globally are yet to put travel in the normal category. Business tourists might continue to come but that will not have much of an impact on tourism unless travel advisories globally are relaxed,” said Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhirelief-for-tourism-sector-as-flying-norms-for-foreign-visitors-eased-101636912211745.html

Later, Preneet and Bittu also CM Captain Amarinder Singh at his Siswan farm house.Of 60 seats in MC House, 32 are in Captain’s constituency, 26 in local bodies minister Brahm Mohindra’s Patiala (rural) constituency and two in Sanaur.Councillors met local bodies minister Brahm Mohindra late on Sunday evening and submitted a signed document, seeking removal of Bittu, a close protégé of Amarinder and Preneet.Mohindra said the councillors have lost confidence in the mayor and had requested him to resolve the issue. “Seventeen councillors from Patiala Urban constituency have submitted in writing, on a legal document, seeking the mayor’s removal. Twenty-six councillors from Patiala rural constituency and two others also put up the same demand, following which the whole process was video-graphed,”the minister said, adding, “It suits me politically as well. I have ensured that the whole process has legal sanctity,” Mohindra said.He added that according to the Punjab Municipalities Act, at least two-third of councillors will write a formal communique to the mayor for holding a general House meeting. “If the mayor fails to hold the meeting, any elected member is authorised to hold it. In this meeting, a resolution could be passed for the mayor’s removal. The whole process will be with government approval,” Mohindra added. Responding to the calls for his removal, mayor Bittu said, “Those who were silent over the past four years are now making a hue and cry over my working. After Captain Amarinder Singh’s removal, local Congress leaders and councillors have shifted their loyalties. They are against me, only because I have association with Preneet Kaur.” He added, “It is also strange that a city, which has no association with Patiala city are concerned about him as a mayor.”In a letter to PPCC chief Navjot Singh Sidhu last month, Congress councillor Krishan Chand Budhu had accused the mayor of corruption, misuse of power in awarding contracts and promoting illegal construction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/chorus-grows-for-patiala-mayor-s-removal-councillors-meet-mohindra-101636911911558.html

Sukhbir, who addressed gatherings in this constituency, said Congress leaders had misappropriated MGNREGA funds to the tune of thousands of crores by indulging in bogus billing, as well as over-charging for tiles, pavers and other construction work.He said Congress leaders had opened their tile and paver factories and were supplying substandard material for use in government works. “All such misdeeds will be probed and corruption cases will be registered against the guilty”, he added. Sukhbir said he was also receiving complaints that grain markets had been closed prematurely in the state when the paddy crop had still not been harvested fully. “This is being done under pressure from the centre,” Badal said adding now farmers would be forced to sell in distress. Badal added that the government was oblivious to the spread of dengue in the state. SAD supremo faces protest in Sarinh villageSukhbir faced angry protests from farmer organisations during his visit to Sarinh village on Sunday, where he had gone to campaign for party candidate and former MLA from Gill constituency Darshan Singh Shivalik.

Barnala, Malerkotla and Patiala districts do not have a regular chief agriculture officer (CAO). The Sangrur CAO has been handling these districts as additional charges, effectively making it four districts under him. All this, at a time, when paddy stubble burning, shortage of diammonium phosphate (DAP) and ensuring smooth sowing of wheat remain major challenges. The post of the Patiala CAO has been vacant for the past six months. Since its formation as the state’s 23rd district, Malerkotla has also been seeking post of the CAO. In Barnala, work is being managed with the additional charge since October 22.Barnala district president of BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan) Chamkour Singh Nainewal said the Charanjit Singh Channi led Congress government has been making tall claims of providing employment, but vacant posts of senior agriculture officers had exposed it.“Punjab is an agrarian state, but the key occupation of people is being ignored. With vacant CAO posts, the government appears intent on ruining the sector. The government must answer on how it will implement any pro-farmer initiative when it does not even appoint CAOs,” he claimed. Data with the agriculture department shows Barnala required 18,145 tonne DAP for rabi crops and is facing a shortage of 7,351 tonne. In Patiala, the district demanded 44,000 tonne DAP, and it requires another 17,600 tonne. Sangrur needs 35,500 tonne and requires 5,600 tonne. Farmers also suspected that amid agitation against three agriculture laws against the central government, the state may face shortage of urea supply for wheat crop over the 10-15 days.Malerkotla deputy commissioner Madhvi Kataria said she had written to authorities concerned and spoken to relevant authorities over phone for appointment of a regular CAO for the district. “We are managing things and trying our best,” added Kataria.Punjab agriculture director Rajesh Vashisht said those deputy directors who were available have been appointed, but these vacant posts will be filled after the new promotions. “Sangrur and Patiala are relatively large districts and one officer is managing them. We will appoint deputy directors on these posts soon,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/vacant-agri-management-posts-in-punjab-sangrur-chief-agriculture-officer-handling-3-other-districts-101636911011170.html

Through CCTV cameras, police will be able to identify the burglars and other miscreants it will be easier to trace them. City traders in all main markets have CCTV cameras at their establishments but those in rural markets lack them and are easy target for thieves. In the absence of CCTV footage, it often becomes difficult for the police to identify miscreants who commit crimes at far off places. Under the initiative ‘Pahal’ taken by SSP Prayagraj Sarvshrestha Tripathi, police in rural areas have installed CCTV cameras in markets for safety of traders and their goods. Recently SHO Manda Awan Kumar Dixit installed four CCTV cameras at Manda Khas Chauraha which will cover the market area. Earlier, Baharia police installed a CCTV camera at the shop of a trader at Awaipur Mod market area. Awareness campaigns have also been launched among traders to motivate them for installing CCTV cameras at their establishments for their security, the SSP said. It is worth mentioning that some incidents of thefts have been recently reported from some markets in the district. In the absence of CCTV cameras, police faced difficulties in identification of miscreants. A surge is witnessed in cases of burglaries and thefts during winter nights. Earlier, police approached poor and marginalised sections of the society to help them in their daily struggle, took immediate action in case of missing persons, especially women and children, reunited estranged couples and did other good work under the initiative ‘Pahal’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/prayagraj-cops-install-cctv-cameras-to-control-burglaries-101636910771080.html

14-11-2021||Delhi||Elected leaders switch parties ahead of civic polls in Delhi||NEW DELHI: As the city approaches the crucial municipal elections, due to be held in April next year, it is the season of shifting loyalties in the political parties. According to the records provided by the various political parties, at least 38 municipal councillors have left their parties and joined rival group. The Congress, according to the records, is the most affected with 23 members of the party switching over to the other side -- more than one third of its 30 members elected to the three corporations in the last elections held in 2017. The next biggest group comes from the Bharatiya Janata Party that is ruling the municipal corporation in Delhi for the past three consecutive terms. Seven BJP councillors joined other parties. Despite the party’s poor showing in the 2015 assembly elections, when the BJP could manage only three seats, it retained power in the three municipal corporations. In 2017, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) replaced the Congress as the main opposition in all three municipal bodies, but the BJP had a comfortable majority in all three houses. The rest of the turncoats included three independents, four of the Bahujan Samaj Party and one of the Samajwadi Party.According to political pundits, the municipal corporation elections in Delhi are crucial for all the three main contenders -- for the BJP, it will be a big test if it could manage to hold on to power despite a huge anti-incumbency; for the AAP, it will be the last frontier in its bid for complete administrative control over Delhi after having humbled its political opponents in two consecutive assembly polls; and for the Congress it will be yet another elections where it has to fight to regain whatever space it could that it has ceded to rivals since 2013. Administratively, the municipal corporations play a very important role in the lives of the citizens touching almost every aspect from cradle to the grave. The three corporations in Delhi administer almost an equal area and similar number of services as the Delhi government. For all those who left their parties, the AAP remained the first choice. According to the data, 15 of the 38 joined AAP -- these include seven from the Congress, four from the BJP, two from the BSP and one each from the SP and independents. Besides, at least 20 former councillors from other parties have also shifted to the AAP. Delhi BJP chief, Adesh Gupta, said turncoats will not make any impact in the coming MCD polls. “Many of such leaders from other parties are also willing to join the BJP. But, we are least bothered about poaching. Since the people of Delhi are aware of the corrupt practices being followed by the AAP government, they will never vote for them. We will once again win the MCD polls, and with more seats this time,” he said. In 2017, the BJP won 181 of the total 272seats across the three municipal corporations. He said the BJP councillors who have joined the AAP were “inactive in the organisation”, and were only hoping to a lucrative position. “This is not a family-run party like the Congress or regional parties. Many Congress and AAP people have joined the BJP, so these things happen,” he said. Senior AAP leader and the party’s MCD in-charge, Durgesh Pathak, said the leaders from other parties have been joining the AAP because of the high-headedness and corruption among the top leadership of their parties. “There are number of areas in which the BJP-ruled MCDs have failed to deliver. The heaps of garbage and mountain-like landfills are common sights in the national capital. In the past few years, the Kejriwal government has proved that it can provide better facilities to Delhiites as it has given free electricity and water to one and all. Even the unauthorised colonies have been given the basic necessities. On the other hand, the BJP and the Congress has made the civic bodies a white elephant. Since the workers’ voices in these parties have never been heard by their top leaders, they are shifting their sides to make the MCD pro-people, than being pro-BJP or pro-Congress,” he said. Pathak said many more councillors from both the Congress and the BJP, as well as former councillors, are in touch with AAP and willing to join the party ahead of MCD elections. “But before the entry, we are trying to ensure that they have a clean record, and the conviction to carry forward the pro-people agenda of the AAP,” he said. Senior Congress leader and councillor from Andrews Ganj, Abhishek Dutt, said turncoats make no impact on election results. “The main reason, for the leaders to change their sides before the polls, is the lure of the lucre. And, since the BJP and AAP always attract the leaders, who want to make easy money through politics, they are always the better choice. Since Delhi people have realized the corrupt practices going on in the AAP government and BJP-led MCDs, they are now looking for options. We are sure that the Congress will wrest power in civic bodies,” he said. Experts, however, say that turncoats may not make much of a dent electorally, but they are a clear indication of “which way the wind is blowing”. But, they cautioned, there are always exceptions.Sanjay Kumar of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), said, “It is a common phenomenon that leaders bet on the party having an edge over its rivals. But there are exceptions, too. We must not forget the recent West Bengal results, where many Trinamool leaders shifted their sides to the BJP before the polls. But, despite the side-shifting drama, Trinamool won by a thumping majority,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/elected-leaders-switch-parties-ahead-of-civic-polls-in-delhi-101636909571831.html

A single judge bench of Justice Vivek Chaudhary on November 2 said: “In the given facts and circumstances of the case, the impugned order dated 14.07.2021 cannot stand and is set aside.” “Respondents (in-laws) are directed to hand over the possession of the ground floor of the House No. 3/347, Vishal Khand, Gomti Nagar, Lucknow to the petitioner(daughter in-law) and her son forthwith,” said the court. “Petitioner shall not in any manner interfere with the ingress and egress of the occupants of the floors above the ground floor.

14-11-2021||Mumbai||No spike in cases in Mumbai despite rise in Covid tests||Five days after testing for Covid-19 was increased marginally in the city, no spike has been recorded in the city yet, according to daily Covid-19 data released by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). On the other hand, civic officials have maintained that the period of 15 days after Diwali remains is crucial and they will continue to be closely monitoring the situation till November 20 at least. Daily testing has risen from November 9 anywhere between 33,000 and 41,000 samples from the previous 25,000 to 35,000 tests a day. However, the daily positivity rate remained below 1% throughout. Similarly, active cases in Mumbai have dropped from 5997 on October 13 to 3580 on November 14, a drop of 40.3%. Mumbai has conducted 11.86 million tests until November 14 with an overall positivity rate of 6.40%. Dr Madhav Sathe, former microbiologist at BYL Nair Hospital said, “The load of active cases is going down. Testing in the city had reduced, but is regaining momentum. Fortunately, daily positivity is quite low in spite of huge public movement for festival celebrations, travel, and visits to temples. However, we will have to wait for a week or eight days more to observe any possible impact of Diwali crowding.” To be sure, the city did not see any spike in daily caseload even after suburban train services reopened on August 15. From October 4, the civic body allowed reopening of schools for Grades 8 to 12 followed by reopening of religious places from October 7. Subsequently, theaters and multiplexes in the city were allowed to restart on October 22. BMC officials said that even if the third wave hits the city, it will be milder than the second wave, when the city saw a maximum of nearly 11,000 daily cases. On Sunday the city reported 264 cases and two deaths taking the case tally to 760,329 and toll to 16,292. There are 737,930 recoveries in the city with 97% recovery rate. The mortality rate is 2.14% and there are 3,580 active cases in the city, according to data from the state health department. Dr Sathe added, “The daily count is unlikely to exceed 400 in Mumbai, and for the state, it should not cross 1,500. Overall, things are looking across the country. Also, post Diwali, vaccination rate is picking up. However, close to 20% of the population in India has not taken any dose so far, and 60% are still not fully vaccinated. Our vaccine stock has improved, but the general public feels Covid-19 is gone. This is certainly not true. We cannot let our guard down.” A BMC health department officer said: “The period right up to December 31 is going to be crucial, but most likely in phases. In the first phase, the impact of spread due to festivals and relaxations will be known by November 20. In the second phase, Christmas and New Year celebrations will need to be monitored. There is a possibility of international traffic arriving in Mumbai from western countries as they have long holidays during Christmas week.” As of November 13, 100% of the city’s eligible adult population was vaccinated according to the Central government’s CoWin dashboard. But more remains to be done as thousands of Mumbai residents are still not vaccinated. To be sure, Mumbai may have statistically achieved the milestone of 100% first dose coverage, but the city will have to administer many more doses to truly cover its entire adult population. The reason: An estimated 10-20% people who have got the Covid-19 vaccine in Mumbai are likely to be from other parts of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) or the rest of Maharashtra. “We are definitely accounting for this slight mismatch. Therefore, our vaccination drive will continue aggressively,” said Mumbai’s executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare. “We will have to reach much beyond 100%,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-spike-in-cases-in-mumbai-despite-rise-in-covid-tests-101636908970779.html

The scope of the scheme was expanded to cover government college students as well. The government had also announced that payments will be made every fortnight after the implementation on April 1.“The corporation has already sent bills amounting to ₹60 crore bills over the past months with state finance department, but they are yet to be cleared,” said a PRTC official, who did not wish to be named. Officials added that they are ensuring that the bills are forwarded on time, and the delay in receiving the funds was inexplicable.Nirmal Singh Dhaliwal, convener, PRTC-linked trade unions, said the government had promised to sanction funds every fortnight, but had failed to clear bills over the past six months. “Instead of making late payments to the corporation, the government should give the required amount in advance,” he said. The corporation runs buses from nine depots in Ludhiana, Kapurthala, Chandigarh, Patiala, Bathinda, Budhlada, Barnala, Faridkot and Sangrur. “It spends around ₹65 lakh a day on diesel for running its full fleet of 1,073 buses. The government must ensure that the bills are cleared on time so that the corporation does not face any financial crunch,” said Dhaliwal. PRTC managing director Parneet Shergill says she had joined only recently, and yet to look into the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/free-bus-travel-for-women-prtc-awaits-60-cr-due-101636908070707.html

14-11-2021||Patna||Bihar BJP chief sends Bhagavad Gita to Rahul Gandhi amid Hindutva row||Amid the continuing debate over Hinduism and Hindutva, which was trigged following the release of a book written by Congress leader Salman Khurshid, Bihar BJP president Dr Sanjay Jaiswal on Sunday presented a copy of the ‘Bhagvan Gita’ to Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi at a press conference in Patna. The epic will be dispatched to the Congress leader via post.Addressing the press conference, Jaiswal even called Rahul Gandhi “the most confused leader in the country”. “He should read and understand it to know about Hindutva and get rid of the habit of lying and distorting facts for false propaganda and decisive politics. Trying to differentiate between Hinduism and Hindutva is like differentiating between mother and motherhood or Diwali and Deepawali and he has shown his intent. Sometimes, it is necessary to give knowledge of truth to people resorting to habitual lying, especially the manner in which Rahul Gandhi has been attacking Hindutva. We know he is the most confused political leader of the country and, therefore, he could not have even an iota of knowledge about Hindutva despite visiting temples after temples for sheer politics,” Jaiswal said. Jaiswal said that ‘Gita’ is an epic to understand religion and spiritualism, which remains relevant even today due to its teachings and guidance about the art of living. “It develops the ability to take right decisions and encourages to stand by truth. I am confident that should Rahul Gandhi read and comprehend it, he would have a change of heart to move away from the divisive politics based on distortion and deceit. His remarks on Hindutva, which is in line with Congress DNA, reflect his immaturity and lack of knowledge. He claims to have read Upanishad, but one doubts if he could comprehend even a sentence. He may have tried to read it in Italian,” he added.Jaiswal said that the three big leaders attacking Hindus within 24 hours was a clear indication of the “wicked mindset” of the Congress and part of a larger design. “We knew it from the beginning that these poisonous statements against Hindus were coming on the order of the Gandhi family and Rahul Gandhi only proved our apprehensions right,” he further said.Hitting back at Jaiswal, Congress MLC and AICC media panellist Premchandra Mishra said that the “highly knowledgeable Jaiswal” should first write to the Prime Minister. “People are suffering due to failed promises of Narendra Modi ji, with price rise and unemployment peaking, India is ranked 101st among 116 countries in global hunger index and farmers are protesting. He himself seems confused about Hindu and Hindutva. BJP has a habit of viewing everything from the point of view of political benefit and they are again at it unabashedly,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-bjp-chief-sends-bhagavad-gita-to-rahul-gandhi-amid-hindutva-row-101636907350600.html

Lashing out at Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for misleading people that Congress has a weak organisation in Uttar Pradesh, Priyanka said, “We will show them our strength by contesting alone on 403 seats in the forthcoming Assembly elections in UP. How can they say that we have a weak organisation when over 18,000 workers and leaders of our party had been booked for raising issues of public? We didn’t see Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) fighting for public issues in the past two years,” said Priyanka while interacting with leaders and workers of the party and frontal organisations at a party workers’ conference in Bulandshahr on Sunday. Party leaders and workers from 14 districts of Meerut, Aligarh and Agra divisions attended the conference. She also paid tributes to Pt Jawaharlal Nehru on his birth anniversary at the beginning of the workers’ meet. Spokesperson of Meerut district Congress committee, Harkishan Verma, who attended the Sammelan, said that Priyanka asked workers to be more active on social media in order to counter lies, fake news and propaganda by the ruling BJP. “Elections are won on the strength of women party workers,” she said while calling upon leaders to have a team of at least 25 women workers at each booth. She said that two of them should actively coordinate with others for effective execution of the party’s activities. Priyanka accused the BJP of trying to write a new definition of the country and independence. She asked party workers to reach out to people and explain how constitution is in danger under the BJP rule. She further asked party workers to inform people about the party’s decisions for welfare of women and people of different segments of the society. “Each worker should associate at least five families with the party,” she added. Congress leader said that Mahatma Gandhi, Nehru, Sardar Patel, Baba Saheb Ambedkar and others sacrificed their lives for the Independence. “But BJP leadership didn’t know the meaning of Independence. Only few people enjoy independence today. Family of Hathras rape victim had no independence of doing the last rites of the girl. Now, the time has come to re-do the slogan of ‘ do or die’,” Priyanka said.

The government can impose special cess on sale of liquor to fund alcohol de-addiction and rehabilitation centres and put liquor trade under state control,” reads the letter from CIABC director general Vinod Giri, citing three presentations it had made before the chief minister to underline how prohibition, despite its good intent, was going astray with the emergence of liquor mafiosi.Giri, who also hails from Patna, said that he has been consistently trying to bring the facts before the chief minister since 2019, as liquor mafiosi had poured water over whatever noble intentions the government had behind enforcing the prohibition.“Since imposition of prohibition in 2016, over one-lakh crore liquor has been seized in the state. Even if seizure rate is considered 10%, it means around 10-crore-litre of illicit liquor reached Bihar. Besides, the entire police force is engaged in enforcing prohibition, which means lack of attention on other cognisable offences. Strong enforcement has also created fear psychosis in the private sector,” the letter further stated.Maintaining that the state is losing out on revenue from the legitimate liquor trade which is pegged at around ₹10,000 crore per annum, the CIABC has urged the chief minister to direct liquor factories to hire 50% of their workforce as women which would lead to their economic self-reliance and empowerment.Citing the National Family Health Survey 2019-20 report, the letter said that it clearly states that Bihar consumes more liquor than Maharashtra, which proves that prohibition has not worked. “Report also suggests that 90% of illegal sale of liquor is among poor and backward people and Bihar’s loss has turned out to be neighbour’s gain due to increase in liquor sale in border areas,” it added.The letter further stated that prohibition is known to have not worked earlier in other states like Haryana, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh. “Gujarat, by the way, does not have a complete ban as non-domiciles are permitted alcohol through licensed shops,” Giri added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/apex-liquor-body-writes-to-bihar-cm-urges-to-end-prohibition-101636906750583.html

Anulika has also mentioned that her husband had lodged an FIR at the same police station on November 3, in which he had begged for security after “Ashish Singh had made a bid to eliminate him.” She also accused the Bihar minister’s husband Ashish Singh of killing RJD leader Banni Singh during the last assembly polls. On the other hand, Purnia police are tight-lipped over the issue. Purnia SP Daya Shankar said the police were carrying out massive raids to nab the accused. No arrests have been made so far. Rintu Singh was shot dead on Friday evening near a petrol pump close to the Sarsi police station. JDU leader Leshi Singh refutes allegations, says ready for inspection

14-11-2021||Patna||Oppn slams Nitish govt, seeks CBI probe in Purnia murder case||Seeking a CBI inquiry into the killing of Congress leader and former zila parishad member of Purnia Vishwajeet Singh alias Rintu, the opposition on Sunday alleged that the Nitish Kumar government is protecting criminals, particularly those involved in high-profile murder cases. Lashing out at the chief minister for alleged deterioration of law and order, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav alleged that the state police did little to protect the victims. He also cited the cases of murders of an RTI activist cum freelance journalist in Madhubani and the husband of a district councillor in Purnea. Rintu Singh, husband of current zila parishad member Anulika Singh, was allegedly gunned down by four armed assailants, including Ashish Kumar Singh alias Athira, who is nephew of minister Leshi Singh, at Sirsa area of Purnia town on Friday evening. However, the police are yet to arrest the main accused even 24 hours after the incident.Yadav challenged the government to cull out the “call details of Leshi Singh and the SHO of the police station concerned”, alleging that the same would point towards the involvement of the cabinet member. He also blamed the “health sector mafia” in the state for the murder of Buddhinath Jha alias Avinash Jha, who had gone missing a few days ago and whose charred body was recovered from a secluded spot in Benipatti police station area of Madhubani on Friday night. The RJD leader also blamed the government for the hooch tragedies that claimed more than 40 lives in West Champaran, Gopalganj, Samastipur and Muzaffarpur districts around Deepawali. “An impartial probe into all such crimes may land all legislators of the ruling NDA behind bars. They will end up being brought in prison vans to attend sessions of the House,” Yadav said.Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) chief Madan Mohan Jha demanded sacking of food and consumer protection minister Leshi Singh for her alleged role in the murder of Rintu, who was a vice president of Purnia district Congress committee.Accusing the police administration of having hands in gloves with the criminals, Jha also demanded a CBI inquiry in to Rintu’s killing. “The delay in police reaction and their apathy to arrest the main culprits creates doubt for an impartial probe by the police. The district superintendent of police (SP) must also be removed from the post for his deliberate reluctance to act on the deceased petition for safety and security when Rintu was attacked first on November 3,” said Jha, adding that it was on his behest that the police lodged an FIR regarding an attempt on life on November 3. Jha also threatened of an agitation if CBI inquiry is not initiated. “The party workers would launch agitation in Purnia for justice if the state government refused to order a CBI inquiry in the case,” he said.The deceased’s wife also sought a CBI inquiry in to the murder alleging that the police were not acting against the accused as the main accused is a close relatives of minister Leshi Singh. In her FIR lodged with Sirsa police station, Anulika named the minister as the chief conspirator.Janata Dal (United) national president Rajiv Ranjan alias Lalan Singh, however, rubbished the opposition’s allegations and said that law and order in the state is such that it could send shivers down the criminals’ spine. “Tejashwi Prasad Yadav is a non-resident Bihari. Maybe, he (Tejashwi) could be thinking about the Bihar when his parents were in power. Police is investigating Rintu Singh’s muder properly and no guilty in the case would be spared,” the JD(U) leader said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/oppn-slams-nitish-govt-seeks-cbi-probe-in-purnia-murder-case-101636905850974.html

Heartiest congratulations to all officials and members for this remarkable achievement,” Banerjee wrote on Twitter. State education minister Bratya Basu also expressed happiness over the achievements and complimented all the stakeholders in the sector, including teachers, officials and students, for their efforts and services to ensure that teaching activities do not get hampered during the Covid-19 pandemic. "Happy to share that the Tourism Department of GoWB has received the esteemed SKOCH GOLD award for transformational performance during #COVID19!

Let us keep aiming higher,'' Banerjee also said on the microblogging site. Adhikari alleged that spending more results in "bigger awards". "Some WB Govt depts have won ‘prestigious’ SKOCH Awards recently. There are serious allegations regarding the credibility of such awards. Seems like everyone who applies gets the award. In final stage one just has to buy expensive stalls for displaying themselves," the BJP leader said. He also said, "Spending more results in bigger awards. For eg (example) Skill development dept bought a ₹12 lakh stall & got Gold award while someone bought ₹2 lakh stall & received Silver award or SKOCH order of merit. These 'for sale' awards raise questions about the authenticity of the awardees." West Bengal power minister Aroop Biswas denied the allegations and said the Skoch gold award is an important honour for every recipient who meets certain criteria and benchmarks. "The BJP was rejected by people of the state in the last assembly elections," he added. Notably, the central government's tribal affairs ministry had received the 'Skoch challenger' award for its performance in e-governance earlier this year, while Maharashtra's rural development and Haryana's industries and commerce departments had also won the award for liability register payment system and ease of doing business respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bengals-education-tourism-depts-win-skoch-award-suvendu-questions-credibility-101636903839664.html

14-11-2021||Pune||State fails to improve key child health indicators as per National Family Health Survey||PUNE In the past five years, as per a report from by the National Family Health Survey (NFHS), the state average for important indicators with regards to children aged under 5 years has not seem any change, despite measures put in place. The state average for stunting, wasting, severe wasting and also underweight, have not seen any noticeable changes in the past five years.Despite a few districts reporting a declining trend in the number of children reported as underweight, there are many that still need attention with regards to all the four primary indicators of child health. The NFHS survey happens four years in Maharashtra. The basic indicators for the health of a child is dependent on stunting, which is children who are short of height in proportion to their weight and age; wasting, which is loss of body weight in proportion to the height of the body; and severe wasting which is wasting in increased proportion - this could be loss of body mass; and lastly underweight, when the weight of the child is below the expected weight for a particular age. These are the primary indicators used to conclude if a child is healthy. As per NFHS 4 report for 2015-16 and then 2019-20, the state average for stunting went from 34.4% in NFHS 4 to 35.2% in 2019-20, while the same for wasting went from 25.6% in the previous survey to now 25.60%, for severe wasting it went from 9.40% to 10.90% and for underweight kids the numbers went from 36% to 36.10%. These despite the state taking several measures to ensure that the national and state-level health programmes are in place on the ground. Comparing data from the NFHS 4 report and NFHS 5 reports, some of the districts that have performed well in the past five years are Akola, Jalna, Jalgaon, Beed, Gadchiroli, Gondiya, Nashik, Osmanabad, Raigad, Satara, Solapur, Washim and Yavatma, which have shown a decline in the number of weak children in at least three of the four parameters. While districts that have not shown positive results are Ahmednagar, Amravati, Aurangabad, Bhandara, Chandrapur, Mumbai island, Palghar, Pune, Ratnagiri, Sangli, Sindhurdurg and Buldhana, all of which showed a continued negative trend in at least three of the four trends. Rubal Agarwal, commissioner at the Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) said, “The centre has praised our work in 12 districts which showed a decline in the number of underweight children and our efforts have definitely worked on the ground. The good thing is that multiple districts have shown a positive change and now we have to focus only on those that are reporting a decline.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/state-fails-to-improve-key-child-health-indicators-as-per-national-family-health-survey-101636899729695.html

He was addressing a gathering after a road show during the Samajwadi Vijay Yatra in the Hata area of Kushinagar district in eastern Uttar Pradesh.“The BJP needs to reply to JAM, but it is diverting people’s attention from core issues like inflation, corruption and unemployment. We will reply to their JAM with our butter. Soon, you will know what our butter is,” Akhilesh Yadav said.On Saturday, Union home minister Amit Shah had attacked the Samajwadi Party at a public meeting in Azamgarh, the Lok Sabha constituency of Akhilesh Yadav.He had asked people to choose between SP’s JAM (Pakistan founder Jinnah), Azam Khan and Mukhtar Ansari and BJP’s JAM(Jan Dhan account) Aadhaar card and Mobile phones to eradicate poverty.Amit Shah had said, “BJP gave the people JAM – Jandhan (bank accounts), Aadhar and Mobile — but the SP people say they have also brought JAM - Jinnah, Azam Khan and Mukhtar (don-turned politician Mukhtar Ansari).”“Tell me whether you want BJP’s JAM or SP’s JAM. These people can never work for the welfare of Uttar Pradesh. These people do the politics of division,” the BJP leader had said at the public meeting in Azamgarh where he laid the foundation stone of a state university.For his part, Akhilesh responded to the turnout at the road show by saying: “The people of Uttar Pradesh have decided to change the government which has changed names and colours.”“They have laid the foundation stone of a university in Azamgarh but they should also mention its budget. A medical university that they have set up in the name of Atal Bihari Vajpayee is running on the ninth floor of a medical college which was built by the SP. In addition, an agriculture university which was given to Azamgarh by the SP was taken to Gorakhpur by Babaji (an apparent reference to chief minister Yogi Adityanath who is also the chief priest of the Gorakhnath temple in Gorakhpur).”While attacking the BJP, he also said, “At least, they should say how much investment has come to the country.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/sp-chief-akhilesh-yadav-hits-back-at-amit-shah-s-jam-jibe-101636899429426.html
14-11-2021||Pune||First ‘platform parking’ in the state begins at Hadapsar railway station||PUNE The next time you travel from the Hadapsar railway station and need to board a train, simply drive your vehicle onto a platform allocated for drop-offs, and/or pickups, and gain easy access to the trains at the station.The idea of ‘platform parking’ comes from the Howrah railway station in Kolkata, where passengers can take their vehicles inside the railway station, and onto a dedicated platform, to board a train, or pick some passenger up. The Hadapsar station now is the first in Maharashtra to offer the platform option for drops and pick-ups. There is no waiting allowed and an efficient system is in place to manage to the flow of vehicles.Currently, there are four platforms at the Hadapsar railway station and one foot overbridge. “Lots of new developments and passenger amenities have been developed at the Hadapsar railway station, as we are now shifting train operations to start from Hadapsar. Currently, a Hadapsar to Hyderabad daily special runs from here and soon a few more trains will also start. In this development process a parking space just next to what is platfrom number one has been created where passengers park their vehicles and directly board the train from the platform,” said Renu Sharma, Pune divisional railway manager (DRM). “It will be like the Howrah railway station’s platform parking system, where vehicles enter the station and passengers board or pick up trains. The parking lot area is small at the Hadapsar station, but it can be increased after more train operations start Hadapsar,” added Sharma. The daily Hadapsar to Hyderabad train departs at 3.30 and it is stationed on platfrom number 3. Another special train, Hadapsar to Jhansi has been started. The station is on the Mundhwa-Kharadi bypass road in Hadapsar and has only one approach road. The capacity of the platforms has now increased to 22-coach trains. Vipul Alekar, a nearby resident and passenger said, “We had to go all the way to Pune railway station to board trains. Now if more trains start running from here it is beneficial for all of us. Also the platform parking system will reduce the hassle of carrying heavy luggage and running to catch the train in time. It will also help elderly people to easily board the train.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/first-platform-parking-in-the-state-begins-at-hadapsar-railway-station-101636899369595.html
14-11-2021||Mumbai||Violence and rioting a ploy to destabilise Maharashtra government, says Sanjay Raut||Shiv Sena on Sunday said that the violence and rioting in a few cities of Maharashtra is a ploy to destabilise the state government. Sena leader Sanjay Raut’s statement came after incidents of stone-pelting were reported from Nanded, Malegaon and Amravati, in the backdrop of protests staged against the violence that took place in Panisagar in Tripura, on October 27. The Sena leader asked why there should be a reaction in Maharashtra to incidents that happened in Tripura. He added, “Why only Maharashtra? Why not in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Delhi, Karnataka, or Madhya Pradesh. We feel that there is a bigger conspiracy to create tension in the country and to destabilise the Maharashtra government,” the Sena Member of Parliament (MP) said. Raut said that Hindus are being targeted in Kashmir, jawans are being martyred, an army colonel was killed with his family in Manipur in an ambush, but no such protest was held so far. The Sena MP also questioned the protest in Tripura where stones were allegedly thrown at mosques. Following the alleged incident, violence was seen in Amravati and Nanded on Saturday. Raut further said that if Hindus are truly under threat then Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat should lead a protest in Delhi, and ask Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah about Hindus being targeted in Kashmir. “The attacks on the temples in Bangladesh is a matter of concern, but Hindus are being targeted and killed in Kashmir. Why are there no protests against it,” he asked. He further said, “All the nationalist and Hindutvawadi parties must come together and lead a protest in Delhi under the leadership of RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat. Questions must be asked to Amit Shah and Prime Minister on what is happening against the Hindus in the country.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/violence-and-rioting-a-ploy-to-destabilise-maharashtra-government-says-sanjay-raut-101636899189345.html

Workers from the maintenance and administrative departments have returned, but a large number of drivers and conductors are still on strike, due to which buses cannot be operational. “We will continue the strike as our main demand of merging the MSRTC into state government has not been heard. This time it is a do-or-die situation for all of us. We are aware about the inconvenience caused to passengers, but the state government should also realise and understand our issue,” said Sandeep Panchal, a protesting driver at the Swargate ST stand. “Till now 350 workers have joined work in the Pune division and we are in continuous dialogue with other workers too. The decision will be made by the state government, but it is necessary for workers to join work, as the main Diwali season is on. We have started operations of private contractor-operated Shivshahi and Shivneri buses from our ST stands and the number will increase to 100 in the coming days. Proper police protection is provided to these buses,” said MSRTC Pune divisional controller Ramakant Gaikwad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/msrtc-drivers-conductors-stay-on-strike-but-350-admin-staff-back-at-work-in-pune-101636898589321.html

14-11-2021||Kolkata||Video showing ‘money for nomination’ call stings Bengal BJP; party alleges conspiracy||A video, showing a cell phone during a call being made on speaker mode, caused embarrassment for the Bengal unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Sunday afternoon as it purportedly showed a party worker asking for one lakh rupees from an unidentified person for candidature during the coming civic body polls. The BJP worker also allegedly claimed that victory for some BJP candidates could be ensured “in arrangement with the TMC”. The unidentified caller, who sought nomination for 12 people, tried to bargain. The video, the authenticity of which could not be verified by HT, was posted by the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) on its official Twitter handle at 12.41 pm. It soon went viral. Elections for Kolkata and Howrah municipal corporation seats will be held on December 19. It will be followed in phases in more than a hundred civic body areas in the rest of Bengal. Though the five-year tenure of most of the civic boards ended in 2018-19, the polls were indefinitely postponed because of the Covid-19 pandemic. The video purportedly showed a conversation taking place between Pritam Sarkar, a BJP worker from Behala in the south-western suburbs of Kolkata, and an unknown caller. Sarkar’s photograph, which was apparently saved in the caller’s phonebook, showed up on the screen. The conversation mentioned BJP state president Sukanta Majumdar. The TMC’s tweet said: “@BJP4Bengal is demanding one lakh for each candidate. @DrSukantaBJP, is this how you collect funds for your propaganda? SHOCKING!” Majumdar brushed aside the allegation and said, “The BJP worker featuring in the video earlier worked for the TMC. The truth will be exposed soon.” Sarkar claimed that the voice heard in the video was not his. “This is a conspiracy by a group of people who want to create problems for the BJP before the civic polls,” he told the media. The name of Shankar Sikdar, president of the BJP’s south Kolkata unit, also figured in the conversation. “This is a conspiracy by the ruling party and certainly not the first one. Our leaders are not involved in such practices,” said Sikdar. TMC state general secretary Kunal Ghosh said some BJP leaders had alleged in the past that money changed hands before allotment of election tickets. “Even former state BJP president Tathagata Roy recently alleged that money played a role in allotment of tickets before the recent assembly polls. This video calls for a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation and Enforcement Directorate,” said Ghosh. Bengal BJP’s chief spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya said, “People will laugh at the suggestion that anyone can contest for the BJP by giving one lakh rupees. One of the voices in the audio is doctored.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/video-showing-money-for-nomination-call-stings-bengal-bjp-party-alleges-conspiracy-101636894688887.html
14-11-2021||Chandigarh||Solo journey home turns life-changing experience||When Rabindranath Tagore gave the call of “Ekla cholo re,” even the poet laureate would have been unable to fathom the turmoil that a kid, all of 13 years, was undergoing as he embarked upon his first solo journey from Jamshedpur in faraway Jharkhand to his hometown of Patiala away from the protective care of his parents and comfort of his friends. My father was with the Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti and a frequent traveller, but yours truly, a student of Class 9 at Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya at Saraikela in Jharkhand, was making his first lone foray into the unknown to spend the summer vacation with his mother who lived in Punjab. According to the original plan, my father was to accompany me but had to cancel the trip due to some urgent work. The thought of being alone in a train scared me no end. It was 2008 and incidents of retaliation against attacks on North Indians in Maharashtra were taking place. Clashes had taken place at railway stations in the region that fuelled my apprehension. But overcoming the reluctance, I decided to undertake the journey. My mother was to receive me at the New Delhi railway station. “Mom, please reach on time. I want to see you in front of my compartment when I arrive,” I begged her. Finally, the day to travel dawned. The train was to leave at 7am and reach Delhi by 5am the next morning. My reservation was in an air-conditioned compartment as my father wanted to make sure I had a safe journey. Most ofthe passengers were asleep. My father pulled out a ₹100 note. Giving it to me, he advised me to stay alert. Then in a stroke of paternal affection, he took out ₹500 more and handed the money to me. The temperature in the AC compartment had dipped, but I felt the warmth in his concern. By afternoon, a gentleman in his mid-40s seated on a berth next to me, woke up. After a few minutes, he asked me my name. “Sutanterpal,” I replied. “Where are you from,” he continued. “Punjab,” I said. He smiled and said he was also from Punjab but lived in Delhi. I felt my confidence go up. He offered me his mobile phone so that I could talk to my mother, who was relieved to hear my voice and we reiterated our commitment to meet at the Delhi station the next morning. The gentleman was listening to my conversation. After I was through, he asked me why I was troubling my mother by making her travel from Patiala to Delhi. After I explained the situation, he said, “In future, you should travel alone as your mother can’t be with you every time. You should learn to be independent instead of depending on your parents.” His words forced me to rethink my decision. Convinced, I called up my mother and told her that I would be able to reach Patiala alone. The next morning, after we reached Delhi, the gentleman accompanied me to the Inter-State Bus Terminus. After making me comfortable in a bus, he called up my mother and gave her the details about the bus I had taken for Patiala. By now, my hesitation had gone and I was bubbling with energy and enthusiasm. My first solo journey, undertaken without the security of my parents, gave me the confidence and courage required to step into adulthood. Later, I went on to travel alone from Patiala to Jamshedpur on a few more occasions, including going to Delhi to receive my mother when she was returning from Jamshedpur. Life sure had come full circle. spsmanes.000@gmail.com The writer is a Patiala-based freelance contributor||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/solo-journey-home-turns-life-changing-experience-101636892768667.html
14-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi pollution: Govt to hold meetings with DTC and metro officials to increase frequency of public transport||Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai told reporters that the government will hold a meeting with Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) and Delhi Metro officials on Monday to make public transport more frequent as the national capital’s air quality index (AQI) fell into the “very poor” category on Sunday."Tomorrow we'll hold a meeting with Metro and DTC to increase the frequency of public transport," Rai told reporters on Sunday.The Delhi government has announced the closing of schools for a week and issued an advisory for government employees to start working from home. Construction work has also been ordered to stop starting from November 14 till November 17.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said a complete lockdown of the city was likely but the decision would be taken after consultation with concerned agencies and the federal government.Confronted with a worsening AQI and a thick haze enveloping the national capital region, the Delhi government has started to push public transport and bicycles as a viable alternative to personal vehicles.Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia urged citizens to ride cycles or take the bus to curb air pollution. “To reduce pollution, foremost responsibility lies with the government to make rules and regulations. Then the industrial sector and thirdly, we as individuals. Take out at least a day to travel via cycle or bus,” Sisodia told reporters on Sunday.The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader, who was participating in a campaign to promote safer and cleaner streets, rode a bicycle to raise awareness and insisted that “people can ride a cycle at least once a month to prevent pollution and save the environment for future generations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-pollution-govt-to-hold-meetings-with-dtc-and-metro-officials-to-increase-frequency-of-public-transport-101636888940749.html
14-11-2021||Pune||Your Space: State government should ensure ST travellers do not suffer due to MSRTC strike||The strike by the staff of the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) over grievances has left travellers stranded at bus depots even as the Bombay high court has directed the state government to resolve the issue. Hapless passengers are left at the mercy of private transporters who have hiked ticket fares. Readers share steps that should be taken to ensure bus users do not suffer... Provide transport facility for outstation students It is unfortunate that between the mismanagement of the state transport and the strike of the employees, the common man is paying the cost. The state transport (ST) is one of the cheapest and safest way of traveling across Maharashtra and inter-state. And the employees like drivers and conductors work hard to keep the system functional. In such a case, if the employees are not adequately paid then it seems only legitimate for them to go on strike. But the common people are suffering because of this. Especially, students who want to return to cities to rejoin colleges. They have to pay a lot of money to private transport vehicles for transport. The Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) and the state government authority should ferry buses at fixed and lower prices to cities. For example, many students commute from Marathwada to cities like Pune and Mumbai. There should be special buses to help them reach their destination in time. Sai Waghmare Commuters suffer Many people who travel to hometown during the festive season faced hardship because of the strike by the staff of the state transport (ST) corporation. When the Diwali vacations for students were cut off abruptly, many parents could not get access to state transport buses due to the strike. The local governing bodies and the state government should have thought about the inconvenience to commuters and arranged private buses for them. In my area many families paid as much as ₹1,000 per seat in private buses from villages near Aurangabad to cities like Pune, Nashik and Mumbai. Many families had to hire a car and travel, putting a dent in pocket. Even though the demands are justified of the staff, the government should take steps to ensure that families of economically weaker sections do not suffer during such times. Even today, only the state transport buses connect even the remotest village to the district town or city. The employees should be helped and the issues should be resolved soon. Vidya Kulkarni Regulate private bus fare during ST staff strike I am stuck at my hometown in Ambejogai taluka. I was expected to reach Pune last week, but due to the state transport corporation’s staff strike there are no buses. And private buses are charging exorbitant ticket fare. Here with me, there are many other families and students who face the same plight. The state government should resolve the matter soon. And affordable buses should be started from major towns and cities to ease the situation for commuters. The bus fares should be regulated by the government during these times. Otherwise, private players will hike bus fares as per their wish which is unfair to students like me. The government should intervene. When we have such a strong state transport facility, it should be strengthened further so that there is more demand from citizens and plenty of choice for commuters to choose their mode of transport. Rajesh Deshmukh ST bus is the sole transport option for my village I live in a village near Shirur town in Pune district. There is just one bus that comes to my village and it is run by the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC). Using this bus, I have finished my college from Shirur and this bus is the only reason why students from my village have access to higher education. Even school students from class 9 to 10 use this bus to reach their schools which are comparatively far away. This bus connects us to the rest of the district. And now this bus is not functioning. It has impacted all our lives because we have to walk at least 20 kilometres to reach the main road. There are private small vehicles, but their fare is higher than the state transport buses. Local government bodies should intervene and start immediate transport for students like me who are in remote areas and are in need of travel connectivity. Local governing bodies can take such initiatives which can help many people while the strike is ongoing. Karuna Kadam Foreign tourists were also affected Commuters all across Maharashtra state are facing issues due to the ongoing state transport (ST) strike. One of my relatives were off to Ajantha for a vacation. And there due to the strike, they had to walk from the parking to the base of the caves which is four kilometres. While returning they had hired a bullock cart to travel the distance. There were foreign tourists who were also forced to do the same. This shows that due to the strike, even foreigners are facing issues and they are taking a bad image of our country with them. Hence, I think the issues should be resolved soon by the government. Having said that, I feel the strike is legitimate. The staff of state transport staff works day and night for us. They should be given sufficient pay and on time to ease their life. Due to the Covid pandemic, many people have suffered, including the bus staff. But, they resumed work as soon as transport services were resumed. The government should resolve the issues at the earliest to help commuters travel at economical cost.

14-11-2021||Pune||Curtain Call: A magical theatre experience!||One of the first plays that we ever produced as a group, from Natak Company, was a play for children called “Sutti Butti”. It was based on a story written by Russian writer Sergei Mikhalkov. I had his book of stories at home since my childhood and had known that particular story since long. The parents of all children in a small town are tired because of their misbehaviour and decide to teach them a lesson collectively. They leave town when the children go to sleep. When the children wake up, they are happy at first and later start missing their parents and understand their importance. It was a fantasy (obviously!) and there were many fun moments in the story which had translated in the play version too. We had used a projector and animations in a play for the first time and that was another learning experience for us as a group. The play opened at a children’s theatre festival at Prithvi theatre in Mumbai and we later performed in Pune. The reception was decent. Nothing too memorable! But there was one incident that was magical. We were invited to perform at a new venue in Mumbai. It was the monsoon season and naturally it was raining very heavily. I realised immediately what a foolish and inexperienced decision it was! Nevertheless, the people who were in charge of the venue were extremely sincere and were genuine theatre lovers. We had reached a day early and started our technical set-up. Online booking was not in vogue back then and most of the tickets were either reserved via phone or on the spot. We were informed that our phone booking was zero. But they were hopeful that a decent number of people will come the next day. As you might have expected, it rained extremely heavily. Five minutes before the show the venue managers came and met me. They informed me that the number of people who had come to watch was two. Our team had 17 people! They wanted to check if we wanted to go ahead with the performance and were perfectly ok if we decided to call it off too. My team were at their opening positions, waiting for the third bell. I knew this was my decision to make, but I felt it would have been unfair to the entire team if they didn’t know. I called them in a huddle and informed them. I also told them that I was thinking of still going ahead with the performance. And that they should not take this show lightly or let this hamper their energy. I was pleasantly surprised to see that everyone was even more charged up! It was a wonderful feeling to see this spirit. The third bell was given. Our audience members had taken their seats in the front row. The opening music piece started. As the curtain opened, so did the main door of the auditorium and in walked 10 more people. And most of them were kids, accompanied by an adult. It was our audience! They quickly took their seats. My team started performing and I could see the pleasant surprise on their faces when they heard a lot more laughter and response from the audience than they had expected! It has been 12 years to this incident. Till date, it is the least attended performance of mine. But it remains one of the most magical experiences of my life. Nipun Dharmadhikari is a storyteller and looks forward to telling them on stage, in front of the camera or in person.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/curtain-call-a-magical-theatre-experience-101636887127461.html

14-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Now, electric vehicle users can install home charging station at ₹2.5k||In what comes as a piece of good news for the new generation of electric vehicle owners in Delhi, there is now no need to physically visit government departments to apply for the setting up of private e-vehicle charging stations in the national capital. E-vehicle owners can now apply for the same from the comfort of their homes and get charging stations installed within seven days. Moreover, the government has also included the benefit of a subsidy for availing of this facility.According to a report by HT's sister publication Live Hindustan, the cheapest e-vehicle charging station in Delhi will cost about ₹2,500, the original price of which was set at ₹8,500. With a subsidy of ₹6,000 (a 70 per cent discount) in place, applicants will now only have to pay ₹2,500 for the same.Earlier this week, Delhi transport minister Kailash Gehlot launched a single-window system for private e-vehicle charging stations. At the launch ceremony, Jasmine Shah, the vice-president of the dialogue and development commission of Delhi, was also present.With a customer potentially having to pay ₹2,500 for an electric vehicle charging station, Delhi is providing the cheapest of such facilities in the entire country. However, only the first 30,000 applicants for the EV charging facility will get the subsidy on installation charges.Additionally, the Delhi government will also be supplying power for the EV charging station at only ₹4.5 per unit. This is the first time such a convenient process has been developed in India for the ease of electric vehicle owners.Here's how to apply for an EV charging stationHere's a step-by-step guide to applying for an EV charging station in Delhi:1. Delhiites will have to visit the respective website of their power supply company.2. The CA (consumer account) number of the applicant's own electricity connection has to be entered at the link provided on the website.3. This list of power companies has to include any one of the 12 that have been chosen to provide the EV charging facility.4. After the application is completed, a representative from the company will talk to the consumer over the phone within seven days and send a team to set up a charging station,5. The consumer has to pay for the EV charging facility after the subsidy amount has been deducted. The government will provide a guarantee on the charging station for up to three years.6. If a customer is willing to just install the charging station for himself, they can make use of the electricity in their residence but if they are looking to set up a business charging the vehicles of other electric vehicle users, they have to install a commercial meter along with it, at the uniform cost of ₹4.50 per unit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-now-electric-vehicle-users-can-install-home-charging-station-at-rs-25k-101636873433551.html

According to Hindustan Times' sister publication Livehindustan, approximately 2000 weddings will take place in the national capital on the first day itself and, therefore, one should be prepared to face long traffic jams while leaving home.“On Dev Uthan Ekadashi, Lord Vishnu wakes up after being asleep for four months. From a religious angle, several stories have been there. According to one, Lord Vishnu killed Shankhasur on the Ekadashi during the Shukla Paksha of Ashadha month. However, the war left him completely tired,” Livehindustan quoted Acharya Krishna Dutt Sharma, national secretary, of the Akhil Bharatiya Jyotish Parishad, as saying on the significance of the occasion.He further said that Lord Vishnu woke up on Kartik Shukla Ekadashi, and was worshipped by all Gods and Goddesses. “It is for this reason, that he is worshipped on this day, which is celebrated as Dev Uthani Ekadashi. Thus begins the month-long duration, getting married during which is considered auspicious,” Sharma explained, adding that the period will come to an end in December with the beginning of the Paush month.Overall, across the Delhi-NCR region, around 5000 marriage ceremonies will take place and, with the Ekadashi falling on a Sunday, long traffic jams are expected in Delhi and surrounding areas. Since many ceremonies will take place in private farm houses, most of which are on the outskirts of the city, the attendees should leave home hours in advance, the Delhi Traffic Police have advised.According to the Delhi government's latest Covid-19 guidelines, issued on October 29, maximum 200 people can attend a wedding ceremony.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dev-uthani-ekadashi-2021-over-5000-weddings-expected-in-delhincr-101636864782859.html

Maximum fire counts in the two states were reported in 2016, when 94,173 such incidents were seen. This was also the year when Delhi recorded one of its worst pollution spells.“Our analysis shows that if you look at the total fire count recorded in Punjab this year, it is still slightly short of the 2020 numbers.

14-11-2021||Delhi||‘WFH ideal under current situation’: Delhi residents||With pollution hitting ‘severe’ levels in the city, the Delhi government on Saturday said that it will issue a work from home (WFH) advisory to private offices -- a move which was largely welcomed by working professionals even as a few expressed apprehensions of a break in the regular work momentum.Many office-goers said that while work from home is ideal amid the spiralling pollution levels, they added that such decisions could not be enforced by all companies, especially at a time when work was slowly returning to normalcy amid the pandemic.Riyaz, an HR professional, said that while the repercussions of pollution on health can’t be taken lightly, reverting to work from home would break the work momentum. “Personally, I feel that we should adopt work from home... If the weather is not conducive for employees, people will not feel good. An unhealthy employee coming to office will not be very productive,” said Riyaz, who prefers to use his first name.The South Delhi resident said that while there had been some discussion regarding switching to work from home amid pollution concerns, the company has not issued any work from home advisory so far.“If one looks from the business point of view, there will be a sudden break in the momentum of people returning to the office, and a disruption in the day-to-day work. At a time when the business has already been affected due to Covid, such decisions will need a lot of thinking,” said Riyaz.Amit Bhatt, executive director (integrated urban transport), WRI India, said that if people who can work from home do so, it would improve the transport situation and people on the roads will breathe easier. “Air quality is worse on roads... If traffic congestion is eased, people will take lesser time to reach home and will breathe in less toxic pollutants. There will be fewer emissions since there are fewer vehicles on the streets. However, I don’t think that all activities can take place remotely,” said Bhatt.Bhamini Shenoy, who works with a law firm having offices in Delhi and NCR, said that she will opt for work from home if given the choice. “Due to pollution, I can regularly feel my eyes burning and throat itching... At least till the time the situation in the city becomes better, I’d prefer to work from home,” said Shenoy.She, however, added that all employees could not afford to work from home. “ The senior management that engages with clients will need to come to office even if an advisory is issued,” said Shenoy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/wfh-ideal-under-current-situation-delhi-residents-101636841947237.html
14-11-2021||Other||Ludhiana: Harpreet Kang’s book on dealing with pandemic blues launched||Harpreet K Kang, a journalist, academician, entrepreneur launched her book “I Am” with much fanfare on Saturday. The book was launched at the PCTE Group of Institutes where several leading authors, critics, and journalists besides other eminent personalities from the industry gathered to double celebrate the birth of a new author and a new book.Prof Bhupinder Aziz Parihar, an Urdu poet, translator and editor was the keynote speaker. He is a prolific writer with over 50 books to his credit. He analysed the book based on the post-colonial era authors and works done by contemporaries. He said, “The opening decades in the west were problematic. The literature of this age introduced four major concerns in modern English writings. Alienation, quest for identity collapse of communication and search for roots. These were the existential dilemmas and crises that have re-emerged today in our post-modern times rather more acutely and more menacingly. The book ‘I Am’ appears at a time when human faculties are numbed and the thin line between living and extinction has blurred beyond belief.”The book ‘I Am’ is a powerful turnaround in simple interactive dialogue, with incredible examples that help readers transcend their minds. Harpreet K Kang said “I Am” gives the reader a profound understanding of self-evolution, consciousness, and acceptance. The early onset of the pandemic followed by the lockdown was hard for most and it is not different even today, a year and a half down the line. She said the turbulence and unexpected changes severely affected mental health and well-being. Responding to struggles among people around her, a journey, which began with simple friendly counselling, led her to pen down her thoughts in an endeavour to reach the larger masses with her message.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-harpreet-kang-s-book-on-dealing-with-pandemic-blues-launched-101636840376543.html

The police had, three days ago, filed a chargesheet against Bains and six others, including Bains’s brothers, in the rape case in the court.Demanding the arrest of Bains in the case, Dhanda alleged that the police was giving free hand to Bains for pressuring the victim and other witnesses in the case.Dhanda said the FIR was lodged eight months after the complaint was made against Bains and it took four months for the police to submit the chargesheet, which should have been submitted in two months. Citing the chargesheet, Dhanda stated that the police have submitted in the court that arresting Bains might result in a law and order situation and he cannot run away as he is a public representative. “This shows the incompetence of the police and the state government in arresting Bains and chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi should resign as he is also trying to help Bains,” said Dhanda. Meanwhile, MLA Bains stated that he will not comment on the allegations levelled by Dhanda and any other leaders as the allegations are “baseless”. “Earlier also false FIRs have been lodged against me in a bid to pressurise and stop me from raising the voice of the public. I have full faith in the judicial system and will surely be announced innocent in the case,” said Bains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/rape-case-chargesheet-against-lok-insaaf-party-mla-simarjit-singh-bains-weak-says-sad-leader-101636840311199.html

Since students will appear for the first time post relaxations in Covid restrictions, we don’t want them to be under any kind of stress,” said Yograj Sharma, PSEB chairman.Pertinently, boards will be held in two sessions of 50 marks each.He added that though students no longer will go to other schools to take their board exams, their subject teachers will be deputed in other schools for the exam duty.“This will help us to stop students from cheating and thus staff will be shuffled for the exam duties,” stated Sharma.Moreover, to refrain schools from adopting cheating tactics, the PSEB-affiliated private schools have been strictly asked to install CCTV cameras in classrooms during the board examination or else the board will cancel the examination centre on the day of the examination.“The order for the installation of cameras is only for private schools since they will have their own staff on duty,” added the chairman.A Performa as an undertaking pertaining to the same has been mailed to the schools and the principals have been asked to submit their forms with the board till November 15.Mixed response from teachersMeanwhile, the decision has got a mixed response from teachers in the district.A government teacher in a senior secondary school, Ludhiana, said this will be an opportunity for private schools to improve and manipulate their results.“The policy of students going to other schools for their board exams was earlier formed to curb the practice of helping students during their final exams to procure better results for schools. Now private schools will easily manipulate the board results of their students,” said the teacher.Another teacher appreciated the move stating that students are already overburdened with so much on their plate and thus this will help them mentally.However, for the first time, students will get the objective type question papers in their board exams.“Since students were busy preparing for National Achievement Survey (NAS) since the past a few months, similar multiple-choice questions (MCQs) pattern followed in the NAS will be followed in the first session of the board exams next month,” said a senior official in the education department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-now-pseb-to-conduct-class-8-10-and-12-board-exams-at-selfcentres-101636840133299.html

14-11-2021||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz | Lucky Daboo from the LoC||Shelling and landmines routinely claim wild creatures on the LoC, leaving the offspring of such species as the high-dwelling Himalayan black bear orphaned. The story of Daboo is also one of great torment and an accursed birth but human compassion turned around the fortunes of this doomed bear cub. Daboo’s mother was shot by poachers on the LoC in the Neelum valley of PoK. The poachers cropped the ears of the cub, which had barely opened its eyes, to sell it in the bear baiting market.Ears are cut in furtherance of this illegal blood sport in Pakistan. A pack of proverbial blood-drinking dogs, reared to exhibit extreme viciousness, are launched on the bear tethered to a stake. Galleries ogle and place bets on blood and gore. The flaps of bear ears are docked because dogs target them, leading to wounds and a reduction in the longevity of the entertainment’s mainstay.By providence, Anila Umair and Sana Raja of the Critters Ark, Rawalpindi, got wind of the cub’s auction and managed to extricate the wailing waif from the poachers’ clutches. The cub was emitting heart-piercing cries very similar to a human child when teased and ill-treated by its ‘deaf’ tormentors.Once safe in foster mother Anila’s house, the cub received tender care and was fed three litres of milk daily every three hours from a baby feeder. Its ears healed and scabies subsided. Christened ‘Daboo’, the cub’s life bloomed to one of a happy child’s disposition.The cub was handed over to the Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB), where it has found the genial company of another cub, Baloo, rescued from a bear charmer. The IWMB plans to rehabilitate Daboo in the LoC forests where it was born. Daboo will need all our blessings and fortune to soldier on in those war-ravaged tracts of a paradise lost.The conqueror’s humbug Perched as my better half and me were on the slope of a verdant ridge overlooking the Mirzapur check dam in the Shivalik foothills and savouring a picnic lunch of chilled beer from the icebox and ‘bhurji-piyaaz paranthas’, we welcomed to what seemed to us a guest and a novel on at that. It was distinct from the birds, bees and deer that had crossed our trail to the ridge top. It was a bug, wild by design in colour and pattern.The tiny creature ventured close to our picnic rug. Upon feeling assured there was no danger from what must have seemed to it as a gigantic and an equally exotic pair of two-legged intruders, its long antennae soon assumed a less-nervous twitch. My wife, Hemani, cautiously took some photographs after her instinctive displeasure with the world’s creepy crawlies relented in Nature’s lap of Mirzapur. On my return home, I consulted Dr Sandeep Khushwaha from the Hemiptera Section and DNA Laboratory, Zoological Survey of India, Jabalpur. He has authored research papers on such insect families. Dr Kushwaha identified it from the photos I sent him as the red cotton bug (Dysdercus koenigii -- Fabricius 1775, family: Pyrrhocoridae) with an average length of 16mm.Agricultural scientists working on pest threats routinely label this species as a common pest on cotton. In recent times, they have alarmingly targeted BT cotton. Red cotton bugs feed on seeds within developing cotton bolls, leaving a stain on the lint. Consequently, this feeding by puncturing the flower buds or young cotton bolls usually causes reduction in size; or the cotton plant’s fruiting body may abort and drop to the ground.It is another matter that the human conquest has cleared the natural habitat of such creatures, forcing them to adapt to the supposedly ‘green’ agricultural colonisations of their erstwhile wild homes. Luscious crops of the verdant countryside are, in fact, a minefield for such creatures: booby-trapped as they are with poisons in the guise of pesticides and insecticides.vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wildbuzz-lucky-daboo-from-the-loc-101636836953669.html
14-11-2021||Chandigarh||Witerati | Surviving millennial children||Children’s Day will never be the same. Simply because childhood is no longer the same.Can’t blame it on Trump or Tharoor, as most ills, thrills or spills are wont to be blamed upon. Gone are the days when children eagerly awaited community celebrations or Chacha Nehru-centric tales that defined November 14th.Children’s Day will never be as simple and innocent. Simply because childhood is no longer as simple or innocent as that of yore.Blame it on millennial kids being born as fully loaded digital natives. Wired to the world perhaps with not a milk tooth but bluetooth even before they burp. Born digital natives, with wireless contraptions clothing their cochlear compartments, with corneas affixed to smartphone screens that are possibly the only lens through which they view life or live life.Scarcely space there for Chacha Nehru or Children’s Day sentimentality.There was a time when our childhood excitedly awaited Children’s Day, as much for the gaily caparisoned classrooms and gooey goodies that our otherwise austere convent nuns treated us to, as also for the trip to the movie theatre or the theatrics the tutors themselves staged to entertain the taught.For the millennial kids, no nun. Only an attitude of second to none.In a post-pandemic world, forget theatre, all that virtual classrooms may be staging is a theatre of the absurd. The taught twiddling on touchscreens for an unofficial e-games period, boasting a syllabus of Ludo King or Rummy, whilst the official tutorials roll on, only to pop up their heads into the virtual grid every now and then, to reassure the tutors that millennial childhood is all ears. If not all eyes.Gone is the charm of waiting all agog on Children’s Day for tutors to dish out entertainment to the taught.Instead, the entertainment now already runs right under the e-nose of the tutors. Parallel entertainment peculiar to Pandemic’s virtual classrooms.A recent chat may contain clues to the deglamorisation and downgrading of Children’s Day revelry.“What would you like for Children’s Day?”This poser was tossed at one’s offspring by a bosom overflowing with instincts of mothering. Rather, smothering.“Children’s Day?” “You know it commemorates Chacha Nehru’s birthday?“Chacha?”The offspring’s contorted countenance conveyed it all.“On Children’s Day, our teachers or parents treated us to chocolates, chikkis or candy floss,” pre-historic Motherhood dished out nostalgia. “Hmm, so why don’t you treat me to ‘death by chocolate’ Belgian waffle cake?”“Btw, Candy, who?”‘Death’ of an era of Childhood.Move over, Chacha Nehru or Chacha Chaudhary.Enter, Candy Crush Soda Saga.Motherhood bestirred to oblige millennial childhood.“Sure sweetheart, let me call the confectionery ... ““Better still, gimme your card and lemme order on Swiggy.” That one’s progeny had finally ordered some treat, ostensibly as a run-up to Children’s Day, was borne upon one the moment the smartphone squiggled with a notification.“Mom, you must have got an OTP,” the offspring peeped out of the door, only to retreat and shut the room again.Motherhood squirmed at the new face of disconnected childhood or teenagehood. That indeed is the one defining thing perhaps for which Millennial Childhood peeps out of the digital existence to talk or connect to parenthood.OTP Childhood.

14-11-2021||Chandigarh||Guest column | Embracing life, the virtual way||Sitting through the online sessions of the decennial edition of the Khushwant Singh Literary Festival, got me thinking that humans have been endowed with the unique qualities of resistance and resilience, which allow us to transform challenges into opportunities. The catastrophes that we encounter in life contain in themselves the seeds of new openings, if only we can discover them. Case in point: the coronavirus pandemic and the subsequent lockdown came as a challenge, calling upon us to do away with our intensely intrinsic urge for human connection, and putting our survival impulse to the test. Being trapped in our homes without any social interaction, a sense of ennui and torpor made us uneasy in the initial days. But soon the cyberspace took the world by storm: work from home, online classes, webinars, virtual interactions, online shopping, and home delivery brought dormant humanity back to life. As the internet kept us hooked to our devices, we became dependent on a profusion of online activities, not just for entertainment but to find something worthwhile to do to broaden our intellectual horizons, thus taking us out of the deep dark pit of vacancy and inadequacy. The aforesaid literary fest was one of the many I have attended recently. Invitations have been forthcoming in bunches for book launches, meet-the-author sessions, literary discussions, poetry sessions in different languages, webinars on history and culture, including dance and music. Listening to and interacting with renowned authors, historians, and social figures of national and international repute, particularly those from across the border, whom I would have never met otherwise, has come as a boon. All this keeps me busy day-in and day-out, so much so that on a few occasions, I have attended two sessions simultaneously, shuttling between the two.At times, I wonder if I would have been able to attend such sessions physically, during the normal days, without Covid and its restrictions. Perhaps not.First of all, being an ordinary person, a part of Hoi Polloi, I would have never got the invitation to rub shoulders with the literary elite that usually forms the audience of these festivals. But here I am, attending all these without the hassle of getting ready, driving down to the venue or flying to another city. Even if I were privileged to get the invitation, I would not have been able to attend them all. Thanks to the prevailing situation, I can attend these events comfortably and with such regularity. My husband, too, has a number of programmes of his choice lined up for himself, and we both have the advantage of being in our respective digital space, without disturbance or interference. Entertainment has also come right to our living rooms. The closure of movie theatres, and the emergence of a number of OTT platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, Max Player, Voot, and many others, have brought about a revolution in the entertainment industry. They have opened up new opportunities for in-home watching of web series and even feature films, thus bringing families together. As millions of people have subscribed to these portals, there is an overabundance of web series, so much so that sometimes the availability of multi-seasoned Indian, British, American, or Turkish dramas poses a problem of the plenty, making it difficult to pick up one. Here too, we are saved a lot of time and effort. We are spared of the exertion of going to the theatre, booking tickets, planning out lunch and dinner in advance, and then coming home tired, having spent more time in the process than the duration of the event itself. Covid conditions are easing out, yet people, particularly retired couples like us, are comfortable living in a virtual world than the real. Maybe soon people will revert back to the old ways of connecting with each other in physical gatherings and meetings; movie theatres may start working at full capacity; the number of these online activities may come down, but as long as they are here, we are enjoying them to the hilt.It may surprise many when I say that my platter is full, courtesy the coronavirus; but life is not all doom and gloom, and we can always find little good in something bad.njkaur1953@gmail.com(The author is a Patiala-based retired associate professor of English)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/guest-column-embracing-life-the-virtual-way-101636836231358.html
14-11-2021||Chandigarh||Guest column | An ode to Jawaharlal Nehru – the light of Asia||The first Prime Minister of independent India and one of the greatest proponents of parliamentary democracy, Jawaharlal Nehru laid the foundation of our modern nation. Stressing on industrial development, science and technology, he was instrumental in reviving rural India. Under his able leadership, the different states of the country were woven into a Republic, and the Constitution was adopted on January 26, 1950. He oversaw Independent India’s tryst with democracy for 17 years and has always been highly respected and revered, not merely in India, but also globally, particularly for his efforts to ensure global peace. Writing to him on November 27, 1958, president Dwight Eisenhower said, “Universally you are recognised as one of the most powerful influences for peace and conciliation in the world. I believe that because you are a world leader for peace in your individual capacity, as well as a representative of the largest neutral nation.” Educated in England at Harrow School, Trinity College, Cambridge, he became a barrister and practiced at the Inner Temple. He could have had a flourishing legal practice, and yet he immersed himself fully in India’s freedom struggle. Nehru became the right-hand man, the “go-to man” for Mahatma Gandhi and led various non-violent agitations and satyagrahas (civil resistance) in cities, streets and villages. Nehru was imprisoned nine times by the British Government and spent 3,259 days in prison, which is almost 10 years of his life. However, he remained undaunted in his quest for India’s independence. He represented Gandhi and India in negotiations with the British, for the freedom of the country. After becoming the Prime Minister, Nehru laid a strong foundation for democratic institutions in the country. He realised that to propel the country forward, it would be necessary to modernise rapidly. Wisely he evolved the concept of a “mixed economy”, whereby the public and private sectors would play a parallel role in development. Infrastructure projects like electric power, dams, roadways, mining, which had long gestation periods, were spearheaded by the public sector. Indian agriculture underwent a metamorphosis during Nehru’s era. Agricultural universities researched high-yielding seeds and mechanisms to boost production. Punjab state ushered the green revolution in India, leading to a sharp increase in crop production. Nehru also evolved and advocated the policy of non-alignment and peaceful co-existence. After the end of World War II, the world was ruptured by the Cold War between the Western bloc-led by the USA and the Eastern bloc-led by the USSR. Nehru kept India away from global tensions and focused on economic development. Nehru knew that India was home to Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Buddhists and Jains. With his modern, western exposure in his youth, he realised it would be perilous to have a state religion. Thus, secularism was enshrined in the Constitution of India, to ensure that all religions coexist peacefully. Thus, temples, mosques and churches coexist next to each other in villages and towns. Citizens of all religions work in the government, armed forces, and police. Nehru was a learned and widely-read person, cultured and refined. His impeccable dressing was a pint of pride. His books - Glimpses of World History, An Autobiography, Letters from a Father to a Daughter, and Discovery of India - reveal his deep understanding of international cultures. Nehru was very cultured and refined. He was always dressed impeccably. The popular prime minister would be surrounded by flocks of people whenever he travelled to any town or village. His fan-following was bigger than that of any modern-day movie-star or a rock-star. Whenever Nehru visited Bombay (now Mumbai) in the 1950s, he invariably addressed a public meeting at the iconic Shivaji Park, in Dadar. I would accompany my father, to listen to Nehru’s speeches, even at the age of 10. Nehru would explain the policies of the government in simple language. I also remember his motorcade passing several times through Gokhale Road, where I lived. The footpaths were jammed with people, waiting to see and wave to him. Police held back the frenzied fans as Nehru travelled in an open-top car waving at the people. After he passed away, his ashes were scattered across India to merge with its soil and seas, according to his wishes. Winston Churchill said in 1955, “Nehru is the light of Asia, and a greater light than Gautama Buddha”. This was an exquisite tribute to a great believer of peaceful coexistence.

These witnesses have written to the local administration in this regard. A total of eight people, including four farmers, were killed in the Tikunia area of Lakhimpur Kheri on October 3.Security was provided to each of the 90 key witnesses of the case by the police after recording their statement before a magistrate on the directions of the Supreme Court last month.“Eight key witnesses have submitted applications wanting their security to be withdrawn citing personal reasons. Their applications will be reviewed before removing security,” said additional superintendent of police, Arun Kumar Singh, who is also a member of the nine-member special investigation committee probing the incident.The local police declined to reveal the identity of the witnesses who want their security removed. On October 3, violence erupted after an SUV mowed down four farmers near Banbirpur village under Tikunia police station limits of Lakhimpur Kheri. Four other people, including two BJP workers Shubham Mishra and Shyam Sunder, journalist Raman Kashyap and a driver Hari Om Mishra, were also killed.Two FIRs—the first in connection with the mowing down of four farmers and the second regarding the killing of four others—were registered at Tikunia police station.The special investigation committee probing the case has arrested 13 accused, including Ashish Mishra, in connection with the first case and two accused in the second case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/lakhimpur-violence-8-key-witnesses-want-their-police-security-removed-101636835755184.html
14-11-2021||Chandigarh||Gurdwara body’s annual polls: Jagir Kaur continuing as SGPC chief uncertain amid assembly poll shadow||AMRITSAR Uncertainty prevails over the continuation of Jagir Kaur as the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) chief after the gurdwara body’s annual polls, scheduled for November 29 this time. The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) that controls the SGPC has declared its candidates for 81 assembly segments but not for Bholath, which Jagir Kaur had represented thrice. If she is fielded as the party candidate, it will be less likely that she gets another term as the SGPC chief. The SAD has already announced to appoint a Dalit deputy CM if it forms the government in Punjab, and the Congress has elevated a Dalit (Charanjit Singh Channi) as the chief minister. In this tug of war to woo the voters from the SC community by giving key posts of their ilk, there are speculations that the SAD president may choose the next SGPC chief from the community. Among the SGPC members belonging to the SC community, Sant Balbir Singh Ghunas’s name tops the list. The four-time MLA, Ghunas is head of Gurdwara Tap Asthan Baba Attar Singh at Ghunas village in Barnala district. Speculations regarding his elevation are stronger this time owing to the changed political scenario in the state, especially the move will counter the influence of Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa faction and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in Malwa. Besides him, names of the SGPC incumbent chief secretary (honorary) advocate Harjinder Singh Dhami, who is also a SGPC member from Hoshiarpur district, and former gurdwara body chief Kirpal Singh Badungar are also making rounds for the post. The SGPC General House will elect president, senior vice-president, junior vice-president, general secretary of 11 executive committee members on November 29. Though the members are supposed to elect the office-bearers and executive members, but for some years, the SAD president names the gurdwara body president which is endorsed by the members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/gurdwara-body-s-annual-polls-jagir-kaur-continuing-as-sgpc-chief-uncertain-amid-assembly-poll-shadow-101636835753890.html

14-11-2021||Chandigarh||Supreme Court allows Punjab and Haryana high court to transfer judges trying cases against MPs, MLAs||The Supreme Court on Saturday permitted the high courts of Punjab & Haryana, Bombay and Allahabad to transfer some special judges trying criminal cases against sitting and former MPs and MLAs to other courts in their respective states on grounds such as “administrative exigencies”, and asked them to find suitable substitutes quickly to ensure that such trials are not delayed. A bench headed by chief justice NV Ramana, hearing a 2016 PIL seeking life ban on contesting elections on lawmakers convicted of heinous crimes and speedy disposal of cases against them, had earlier directed all high courts not to transfer special judges without its prior nod. “To ensure expeditious disposal of pending cases, it is necessary for this court to direct the officers presiding over special courts or CBI courts involving prosecution of MPs or MLAs to continue in their present posts until further orders. “This direction, barring transfer of judicial officers, will be subject to their superannuation or death. If any further necessity or emergency arises, the registrar general of the high courts are at liberty to make an application before us for retention or to relieve those officers,” the top court had ordered on August 10 this year. The high court registries of Bombay, Allahabad and Punjab and Haryana moved separate pleas seeking the top court’s nod to transfer some special judges to some other courts under their territorial jurisdictions. The top court bench, also having justices D Y Chandrachud and Surya Kant, took into consideration the averments made in the pleas and allowed them subject to the condition that the “High Court/State shall provide suitable substitute” immediately so as to ensure expeditious disposal of the cases pending against sitting and former MPs and MLAs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/supreme-court-allows-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-to-transfer-judges-trying-cases-against-mps-mlas-101636835210866.html
14-11-2021||Chandigarh||‘Sangh Parivar’ to counter Punjab CM Channi’s ‘dushman jamaat’ remark against RSS||Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi’s remarks in the assembly on Thursday wherein he termed the RSS as ‘Punjab di dushman jamaat’ (enemy of Punjab) has evoked a strong reaction from the ‘Sangh Parivar’ with the right-wing organisations deciding to launch a drive to counter him. A senior RSS functionary from Majha region, who wished not to be named, said: “From Sunday, we will launch a social media drive to counter the CM’s remarks. Hashtags will be created and cadres have been briefed accordingly.” RSS spokesperson for Punjab, Shashank, said Channi’s remark doesn’t behove a chief minister as contribution of the RSS for the wellbeing of society has time and again been appreciated by senior Congress leaders, including former Prime Ministers Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi. “Channi is absolutely wrong in stating that the Sangh entered Punjab in 1966. The Sangh has been contributing in the development of Punjab and its communal harmony before Independence as well,” he said. The RSS spokesperson cited Gurbachan Singh Talib’s book — ‘Muslim League Attack on Sikhs and Hindus in Punjab 1947’ — which appreciated RSS for safeguarding Hindus and Sikhs during the Partition. He said how the Congress can forget that during the peak of terrorism in 1986 RSS parcharaks from across the country came to Punjab and stayed with Hindu families that were planning to leave the state. The BJP has already criticised Channi on the issue and is planning a statewide drive to show its resentment “The RSS has always worked for the communal harmony of the state and is the only organisation that kept the morale of the Hindu community high during the terrorism days. The RSS has always worked for Hindu-Sikh unity,” said BJP general secretary Subhash Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sangh-parivar-to-counter-punjab-cm-channi-s-dushman-jamaat-remark-against-rss-101636835152365.html
14-11-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: GMSH-16 all set to go digital; access services on phone||The Government Multi Specialty Hospital (GMSH) in Sector 16 will soon be an ‘e-hospital ‘with the patients’ records being digitalised. With the facility, the unnecessary footfall at the hospital will significantly reduce as patients will be able to get their medical test reports, make OPD registrations, book tele-consultation and avail other facilities through their smartphones.In the digitalisation project, the hospital plans to provide 10 services to patients on thier mobile phones. These also include clinic facilities, diet consultation, laboratory works, patient’s admissions and discharge records, and billing of treatment.The hospital’s human resource department, store inventory and radiology department will also be digitised.Dr Suman Singh, director, health services, Chandigarh, said, “From medical tests reports to OPD registrations, every facility will be made available on patients’ smartphones. The hospital has already started some of these services online, but the hospital will be fully digitalised in a month. This is because online connectivity takes time.” On an average, 2,000 people visit GMSH-16’s OPDs daily and besides patients, their attendants also tend to crowd the hospital. This project will streamline the crowd management at the hospital and provide better healthcare facilities to patients at their homes. In June this year, the hospital had adopted the e-Sanjeevani OPD platform, wherein patients were connected to doctors through telephones for consultations. Besides the district hospital, the e-Sanjeevani model was also being followed in 29 health and wellness centres in Chandigarh. “Under the national telemedicine service project, we have already started a new initiative in which specialist doctors can be consulted during the tele-consultation. At UT’s health and wellness centres, a number of patients visit daily for consultation and the doctors attending them can connect with specialists from GMSH-16 to provide more accurate patient care,” Dr Singh said. She added, “For each day of a week, a roaster has been planned according to which specialist services are being provided to patients. The patients are getting services for eight specialities, including medicine, general surgery, skin, psychiatry, eye, orthopaedics, and paediatrics. In 15 days, 132 people have already taken specialist care through tele-consultations at health and wellness centres.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-gmsh-16-all-set-to-go-digital-access-services-on-phone-101636835150976.html

They said Chandigarh Police had barricaded both the gates of the MLA hostel here to prevent the legislators from going towards Channi’s residence. When the MLAs tried to head towards the CM’s residence, they were detained and taken to a police station. AAP legislators who were detained included Harpal Singh Cheema, Saravjit Kaur Manuke and Manjit Singh Bilaspur. They were later released, police said. Cheema said the Congress had promised ‘Ghar-Ghar Rozgar’ for the youth. But in the last over four-and-a-half years, not even 5,500 youths from 55 lakh families were given jobs, he alleged. The AAP leader alleged that no authentic survey had been conducted about the number of unemployed youth in the state in the last 20-25 years. It is estimated that more than 20 lakh qualified youth are unemployed in the state, he claimed. The AAP, as the opposition party, has the same questions to the government as the youth of Punjab, he said. “What has the Congress government done in the last over four-and-a-half years on the promise of ‘Ghar-Ghar Rozgar?” Cheema posed. “Isn’t this a betrayal with the youth of Punjab? Will the Congress, especially the CM, apologise to the lakhs of youth who are struggling on the streets for jobs,” he asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/aap-legislators-detained-while-trying-to-gherao-residence-of-punjab-cm-channi-101636834671032.html

In a statement, Mehtab denied any wrongdoing or any sort of criminal activity by his father as being alleged by the central investigating agency. “My father has been a whistleblower and a crusader for the people of Punjab his entire life. He is being wrongly and maliciously implicated in a 6-year-old drugs case registered at Jalalabad. The said FIR named nine people and Sukhpal Khaira was neither named in the FIR nor was he charge-sheeted in the said case,” he said. Mehtab said his father was elected as Leader of Opposition (LoP) in 2017, and he had raked up the sand mining scam which eventually led to the resignation of the then cabinet minister. “Suddenly two prosecution witnesses, who had already been examined and cross-examined were recalled under Section 311 of CrPC,” he said. Why these two (police) witnesses remained silent for two years and never mentioned the role of Khaira remains a mystery, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ulterior-motives-behind-arrest-of-my-father-sukhpal-khaira-s-son-101636834491863.html

Since October 1, 13 civilians, including five non-locals, have been killed by unidentified gunmen.Hurriyat Conference spokesperson said the prevailing political situation in Jammu and Kashmir is extremely worrying and disturbing and now that large-scale additional deployment of armed forces has been done, it has created an atmosphere of “panic and insecurity” among the people.“The continued policy of arrests, raids, killings and severe human rights violations continue unabated,” the spokesperson said.He added that subjecting people to additional checks and frisking, amid the rising cold weather condition, is leading to harassment. “Crackdowns are also routinely carried out in various areas and men and women are paraded indiscriminately and being subjected to harassment,” the spokesperson said.Hurriyat also criticised authorities for “forcibly preventing Muslims of valley from offering Friday prayers” at Jammu and Kashmir’s largest place of worship and spiritual centre – Jama Masjid Srinagar – from August 6, 2021.

14-11-2021||Chandigarh||Centre turns down Himachal’s request to declare monkeys vermin again||The Centre has turned down the Himachal Pradesh government’s request to declare rhesus macaque monkeys ‘vermin’ again. The state had requested the union ministry of environment, forests and climate change to declare monkeys vermin again, after an earlier notification in this regard, expired in April. Once the monkeys are put in the vermin category, the forest department can cull them so as to prevent crop depredation, conflict with humans, and loss of property. The Centre had declared monkeys vermin for the first time in 2016 in 93 tehsils of Himachal Pradesh by way of a notification. Since then, the Centre extended the permission to cull monkeys at least four times. Of the total 12 districts, monkeys menace is prevalent in 10. Of the 17,794 villages in the state, 2,300 are badly hit. In 2016, the agriculture department reported a crop loss of ₹184.28 crore due to wild animals, particularly monkeys. Following the latest request, the Centre asked the state how many monkeys were killed by farmers during the period in which they were put in the vermin category. It also sought to know whether there was an increase or decrease in monkey attacks on humans. “The government had to file a review petition before the ministry to declare monkeys vermin again. But it could not be done. The department has filed a fresh review petition and we are hopeful that the centre will declare monkeys vermin again,” said forest minister Rakesh Pathania. Principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF, wildlife) Ajay Srivastava said the central ministry had raised some queries and objections which are being removed. He said several instances of monkey-killing by farmers were not reported due to various reasons.“Some data from the field is still awaited and we will write to the MoEF again,” he said. As per the 2020 census, Himachal Pradesh has a monkey population of 1, 36,443. In 2004, their population was more than 3.17 lakh. The forest department attributes the reduction in monkey population to the sterilisation programme. The forest department has eight monkey sterilisation centres in Shimla, Hamirpur, Kangra, Una, Chamba, Sirmaur and Mandi, besides mobile units. Since 2006-07, more than 1.40 lakh monkeys have been sterilised at these centres.President of Himachal Kisan Sabha and former IFS Kuldeep Singh Tanwar, however, said the sterilisation programme has failed to achieve its objectives. He said more than 40,000 monkeys have been killed across the state since they were declared vermin but were not reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/centre-turns-down-himachal-s-request-to-declare-monkeys-vermin-again-101636831670706.html

After the agrarian laws, the landholding in UP, Punjab and Haryana is less than 3 acres. We can’t expect farmers to purchase those machines,” Justice Kant told solicitor general Tushar Mehta.“Why can’t the Centre and the state governments provide the machines? Take away the stubble for use in paper mills and various other purposes. In winters, the stubble can be used for fodder for goats, etc. in Rajasthan,” he said.The apex court was hearing a plea filed by environmental activist Aditya Dubey and law student Aman Banka, who sought directions to provide stubble-removing machines to small and marginal farmers for free.Mehta, appearing for the Centre, told the top court that these machines are being made available at 80% subsidised rate.The top court judge asked Mehta, appearing for the Centre, can the officials assisting him point out the actual price after subsidy.“Can the farmer afford it? I am a farmer and I know it, the CJI is also from a farmer family he also knows it and my brother (judge) also knows it,” Justice Kant, who was sitting as part of a special bench headed by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana and also having Justice D Y Chandrachud, said.Justice Kant also said it has become a fashion to blame the farmers for air pollution.He also demanded whether other measures such as firecracker ban and vehicular emission control were implemented.“Be the petitioners, the Delhi government or anybody else -- it has become a fashion to blame the farmers. Have you seen how crackers are being burnt in Delhi for the last seven days? What was the Delhi Police doing?” he asked.The observations came after senior advocate Rahul Mehra, appearing for the Delhi government, mentioned the issue of stubble burning.The apex court has asked the Centre to hold a meeting with stakeholders and revert on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/poor-farmers-can-t-afford-machinery-for-stubble-management-sc-judge-101636831490967.html
14-11-2021||Lucknow||Shah steps up attack on Akhilesh from SP citadel||Union home minister Amit Shah raised the pitch in election-bound Uttar Pradesh on Saturday by intensifying his attack against Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav in his bastion Azamgarh, and hailing chief minister Yogi Adityanath for ridding the Purvanchal region of “mosquitoes and mafia”.“Modiji brought ‘JAM’ - Jan Dhan bank accounts, Aadhaar cards and a mobile phone to every person - for a corruption-free system, but the SP people say they have also brought ‘JAM’ - Jinnah, Azam Khan and Mukhtar (don-turned politician Mukhtar Ansari),”  Shah said addressing a rally in Azamgarh, represented by SP chief Akhilesh Yadav in Lok Sabha.  “You should tell me whether you want BJP’s JAM or SP’s JAM. These people can never work for the welfare of Uttar Pradesh. They indulge in dividing people on the basis of caste, causing riots, appeasement and vote-bank politics,” he added.Shah was addressing the rally in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh after laying the foundation of a new state university in Azamgarh.Speaking at another public meeting in neighbouring Basti district, Shah lauded Adityanath and Prime Minister Narendra Modi for bringing all-round development of the state and sought another term for him with “record-breaking victory” for taking ‘vikas ki aandhi” (development wave) forward in the state.‘’You (Akhilesh Yadav) never cleaned this area. Mosquitoes were ruling and children were dying of brain fever. But Prime Minister Modi’s Swachhta campaign was implemented here by Adityanath and the region became mosquito-free,’’ he said.“This ‘vikas ki aandhi’ (by the BJP) has to be taken forward, a lot has been done by Modi ji and Yogi ji but a lot still needs to be done for which your blessings are required once again,” he added.The Union minister, who is on a two-day visit to the poll-bound state, also credited Adityanath for making UP a ‘’riot-free” state. “Development of a state is not possible if riots occur. Earlier, riots and curfews were frequent in Uttar Pradesh. Since the Yogi Adityanath government has come to power, no riots have taken place... Now, no mafias can be seen in Purvanchal (eastern UP). Those who came here to make people migrate, have now migrated themselves...,” he said.Taking a swipe at the recent controversy over Yadav’s comment linking Sardar Vallabhai Patel, Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, and Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Shah said: “There are so many people from the minority community here, is there anyone here who sees greatness in Jinnah.”Hitting back, Yadav on Saturday accused the BJP of pursuing the “politics of destruction”.“BJP is pursuing the politics of destruction instead of the politics of development. People in UP brought the party to the Centre. But BJP betrayed the farmers, youth, poor, labourers and traders in the state,” Yadav said while talking to news agency ANI.Azamgarh name change speculationAdityanath said the new state university in Azamgarh will make the district “Aryamgarh” in the real sense, leading to speculation that the district’s name could be changed.“This university will in the true sense make Azamgarh into Aryamgarh, and there should be no doubt about this,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/shah-steps-up-attack-on-akhilesh-from-sp-citadel-101636830971577.html
14-11-2021||Chandigarh||As fog engulfs Kashmir, health experts advise people to avoid morning walks||As Kashmir continues to witness low and sub-zero night temperature, which lead to foggy mornings, doctors have advised people to avoid going out for morning walks as it increases the risk of heart attack and stroke. Another concern is the increasing Covid cases.Jammu and Kashmir’s capital Srinagar recorded the coldest night of the season on Saturday at 0.1°C while the tourist resort of Pahalgam in south Kashmir recorded a night temperature of minus 3.5°C. In the ski resort of Gulmarg, it was -2°C. The mercury went down to -1.1°C in Kupwara and -1°C in Qazigund.For the past few days, the Valley has been witnessing foggy weather conditions in the mornings.“The foggy conditions are owing to sub-zero temperatures and air pollution caused by increased traffic and burning of stubble and tree foliage. Pollution is high here at this time of the year,” said Farooq Ahmad Bhat, meteorologist with Met department in Srinagar.He said temperatures will keep dipping till a western disturbance will change the dry weather condition.“We are expecting dry weather till November 20,” he said.‘Heart attack, stroke patients double during winter’Owing to chilly weather conditions, doctors association Kashmir (DAK) on Saturday said winter chill increases the risk of heart attack and stroke and issued an advisory as Covid was a ‘big factor’ this winter.DAK president and influenza expert Dr Nisar ul Hassan said the number of heart attack and stroke patients in Kashmir hospitals double in winter. “Not only elderly people, but young and healthy individuals come to hospitals with massive heart attacks and strokes and some of them are brought dead,” he said.Dr Hassan said frigid temperatures constrict blood vessels that increase blood pressure, which makes heart attack or stroke more likely.He said this winter Covid-19 is a big factor. “If you catch the virus, you are at an increased risk of having a heart attack or stroke,” he said.For the past three weeks, active cases in the union territory, particularly in Kashmir valley have been increasing. The active cases have been slowly going up, seeing a 70% increase in 23 days since October 20. What you must doThe DAK urged people to keep warm to prevent cold temperatures and perform a healthy workout inside. “If you move out, dress in layers, wear a hat, gloves and scarf. Avoid going out in the chill for a walk and move your workout inside,” said Dr Hassan.“Take healthy diet, rich in vegetables and fruits, and reduce your stress. If you already have cardiovascular disease, avoid strenuous activities, such as shoveling heavy snow. Get your annual flu shot, Covid-19 vaccine and don’t forget to take vitamin D,” he said.The weather is expected to change after November 20 as a western disturbance is expected to hit the region on November 21.“Weather will most likely remain dry till the 20th. A feeble Western Disturbance is likely to affect the region between November 21 and 23, which may cause light to moderate snow over higher reaches especially northern parts of Kashmir,” said director MeT, Sonam Lotus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/as-fog-engulfs-kashmir-health-experts-advise-people-to-avoid-morning-walks-101636831251113.html

14-11-2021||Mumbai||‘100% vaccine first dose coverage is pivotal moment for Mumbai’||Ever since the Covid-19 pandemic began, every step forward has felt like the quote from Lewis Carroll’s Through the Looking-Glass: “It takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place”. While this tenacity has been important for us to avoid complacency, we shouldn’t deny ourselves a celebration of achievements along the way, and Saturday marks one such for Mumbai — 100% of the city’s target adult population has now received its first dose of the Covid vaccine.Vaccinations achieve their intended goal when they prevent disease that warrants aggressive care. This is because the need for such care is commensurate with poor outcomes for patients as well as utilisation of resources in an overburdened healthcare system. We witnessed this during the first two waves in India, and all our efforts must be directed towards preventing this. Thus, it is reassuring to know that even a single dose of the vaccine administered to a majority in India (Covishield) can provide up to 91% effectiveness against hospitalisations or death for the Delta variant, and reasonably high levels for other variants of concern (VOCs). It must be noted that these estimates tend to be lower for individuals above 60 years of age. The four-month data released by our health ministry in September suggests an overall protection of 96.6% against death with a single dose,indicating that a single dose of Covaxin, developed by Bharat Biotech and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), possibly does equally well at preventing death.What about preventing symptomatic milder infection, and thus arresting transmission? This is where a single dose of the vaccine isn’t as impressive, and effectiveness tends to be between 30-70%, varying by study and type of variant causing these infections. This effectiveness increases significantly after two doses. It is heartening to know that 65% of the city’s target adult population have received two doses of the Covid vaccine, and we are hopefully on our way to achieving a 100% coverage with 2 doses.What does this mean in the context of a possible third wave? Most experts agree that preventing it will depend on two factors: a) the evolution of newer variants of the virus which evade vaccine-induced and/or natural infection-conferred immunity and b) the incidence of breakthrough infections/reinfections with present variants. The first factor is a serious concern, although it is reassuring to know that the effectiveness of the present vaccines against severe disease has remained high, irrespective of the VOC. Whether this continues to be the case might depend on our ability to keep transmission (and thereby, the evolution of newer variants) in check. This is where we cannot afford to let our guard down: getting the second doses administered as soon as possible, using effective vaccines for those below 18 years of age, and continuing to engage in behaviours that prevent transmission, are critical. This is a pivotal moment in time when our embracing of masking, attention to indoor ventilation, and attitudes toward crowding might have far-reaching health benefits. The second factor might need the administration of booster doses in the future, but this has to be weighed in the context of vaccine shortages across the globe. Although evidence clearly points toward increased breakthrough infections with the passage of time, such infections appear to be consistently of a milder nature, especially among the non-elderly and those who are not immuno-compromised. The enthusiasm demonstrated by the city’s vaccination team, including frontline workers, administrators/planners in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and allied teams, backed by the government, has resulted in this achievement for the city. As a proud Mumbaikar, I do hope that we sustain this momentum, and not only prevent the third wave, but work towards enhancing the overall health of the city.(Dr Lancelot Pinto is a pulmonologist and epidemiologist at PD Hinduja Hospital)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/100-vaccine-first-dose-coverage-is-pivotal-moment-for-mumbai-101636830955128.html
14-11-2021||Chandigarh||Jeev Milkha Singh Invitational 2021: Shiv takes the centre stage with one-shot advantage||It was a packed leaderboard with multiple contenders in the fray even as Shiv Kapur enjoyed a slender one-shot advantage at 17-under 199 at the end of the penultimate round of the ₹1.5 crore Jeev Milkha Singh Invitational 2021 being played at the Chandigarh Golf Club.The Dubai-based Kapur (64-68-67), a four-time winner on the Asian Tour and one of the pre-tournament favourites, built on his solid previous rounds with a determined five-under 67 on Saturday to be the leader for the third day running.Chandigarh lad Aadil Bedi (68-65-67), a winner on the PGTI in early 2020, kept local hopes alive as he went error-free for the second straight day during his 67 to move up one spot to second position at 16-under 200.Delhi’s Rashid Khan (65-67-69), a two-time Asian Tour winner, slipped out of the overnight joint lead and dropped to third place at 15-under 201 following his 69.Delhi’s Kshitij Naveed Kaul (69) occupied fourth place at 13-under 203.Gurugram-based Dhruv Sheoran carded the day’s best score of eight-under 64 to climb 10 places to tied fifth at 12-under 204. Olympian Udayan Mane (67) was also tied for fifth along with Sheoran.The 39-year-old Shiv Kapur, looking for his first title on the PGTI, had a brisk start as he made four birdies on the first eight holes which included three conversions from a range of 10 to 25 feet.Shiv, who was bogey-free through his first 44 holes of the tournament, then hit a rough patch dropping three bogeys in exchange for a lone birdie between the ninth and 12th holes. He missed a couple of par putts on that stretch including a two-footer on the 12th.Shiv, originally hailing from Delhi, rallied with three birdies thereafter as his accurate wedge shots set up short birdie putts on the 13th, 16th and 17th that gave him the sole lead for the first time this week.Shiv said, “I had a fantastic start and didn’t put a foot wrong till the eighth. Thereafter, I had a bad stretch where I didn’t really hit any bad shots but just made one or two mental errors and maybe had one bad break here or there. I went error-free for two days but made my mistakes in bunches today. However, I’m proud that I bounced back from there with some birdies at the end to put myself in contention once again.”Among Aadil Bedi’s five birdies, the ones that stood out were his 40-feet conversion on the ninth and his chip-in from the bunker on the 13th. Bedi has so far dropped just one double-bogey in the tournament and there are no bogeys on his card.“My hitting was great in round two and I didn’t need to save any pars. But today my short-game was better and that helped me get through the day without a bogey. The three good rounds this week have helped lift my confidence after my recovery from my wrist injury,” said Aadil, who will soon be playing on the Asian Tour as he has a country spot there.Rashid Khan made gains with two birdies on the first 10 holes followed by an eagle on the 13th. He conceded a bogey on the 16th but came back with a superb recovery from the trees to salvage a par on the 17th and keep himself in contention.Besides Aadil Bedi there were three other Chandigarh professionals in the top-10 as Yuvraj Singh Sandhu and Abhijit Singh Chadha were tied seventh at 11-under 205 while defending champion and PGTI Order of Merit leader Karandeep Kochhar climbed 12 spots to tied ninth at nine-under 207 after his round of 65.Among the other marquee names in the field, former champion Ajeetesh Sandhu of Chandigarh and SSP Chawrasia were both in tied 11th at eight-under 208 while Jyoti Randhawa was another three shots back in tied 18th. Former champion Chikkarangappa of Bengaluru was tied 23rd at four-under 212. Gaganjeet Bhullar was tied 34th at two-under 214.The two amateurs to make the cut, US-based Varun Chopra (three-under 213) and Aryan Roopa Anand (even-par 216) of Bengaluru, were placed tied 26th and tied 49th respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jeev-milkha-singh-invitational-2021-shiv-takes-the-centre-stage-with-one-shot-advantage-101636830892683.html

Almost 80% of total cases this season have recorded in November. This, coupled with the numbers, show that Punjab state machinery has miserably failed in implementing the law in place to stop stubble burning. Last year, Punjab recorded 76,590 cases; 2019 saw 55,210 cases. On Saturday (November 13), the satellite captured 3,742 events in the state; on the corresponding in 2020, there were 2,450 cases, and in 2019, there were only five active farm fires seen. The massive fires over the past week highlight that farm fires this year are delayed, and the number is only headed for further increase over the next few days. On Saturday, 515 cases was registered in Sangrur; Moga recorded 422; Bathinda 271; Barnala 201; Ferozepur 330; Muktsar 295 and Ludhiana recorded 302 cases.

14-11-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Dirty water, dangling wires pose danger in Ward 6||CHANDIGARH: Parking pangs, contaminated water supply, dangling electricity wires, poor sanitation, blocked sewers… the list of woes goes on at Ward No. 6 of the Chandigarh municipal corporation. Comprising Mari Wala Town, Shanti Nagar, Modern Housing Complex, Govindpura, Shivalik Enclave, Housing Board Duplex, Rajiv Vihar and Uppal’s Marble Arch, it is among the three wards that Manimajra has been split into.While Shanti Nagar, Mari Wala Town and Govindpura were earlier in Ward No. 25, Shivalik Enclave was in Ward No. 24.In commercial areas, such as Mari Wala Town and Shanti Nagar, the most common problems are inadequate parking space and contaminated drinking water. Residents also complain about sewers getting blocked during monsoons.Surjit Singh, a 70-year-old retired government employee residing in Mari Wala Town, said, “Drinking water is usually contaminated, and the dangling electricity wires pose a threat to the public in the narrow streets of the locality.”In Shantinagar, 26-year-old Prince Dhiman said that cleanliness and parking problems have been the main issues. “Garbage keeps accumulating on the roadside,” he said.Issues pending for longAt the Modern Housing Complex too, residents complained about drinking water problems. Col Gursewak Singh, president of its residents welfare association, said: “The underground water supply pipes are around 30-year old. We have raised the issue many times, but to no avail. Even the sanitation condition is not good, and there is a need for more safai karamcharis.”Meanwhile, the residents at Govindpura locality complain of parking problems and cleanliness issues.Councillor Jagtar Singh, who represents the area, said: “The problem of unhygienic water supply is due to the old water pipelines in the area. I have got 60% of the pipelines replaced and sewerage lines have been placed further from fresh water lines to prevent contamination. With 24x7 water supply project being launched in the city, all pipelines will be replaced.” The councilor said the sewerage lines are also being replaced and a new multi-level parking is also coming up in the area. On the problem of dangling electricity wires, he said it has been proposed to put them underground.KNOW YOUR WARDLocalities: Mari Wala Town, Shivalik Enclave, Govindpura, Housing Board Duplex, Shanti Nagar, Modern Housing Complex, Rajiv Vihar and Uppal’s Marble ArchReserved for women (general)Voters: 19,000 Key issuesDangling electricity wires, especially at Mari Wala TownContaminated water supply and poor sanitation Shortage of parking space and traffic woesLocal voicesWater lines are around 30-year old, and residents complain of contaminated supply.

14-11-2021||Chandigarh||Barista penalised ₹30,000 for billing ₹5 as packaging charges||When going to a cafe for a cup of latte, who would expect to shell out money to get it packed! This is what happened with a Mohali resident when he visited Barista in Phase 3 last year.Kulwinder Singh, a resident of Phase 6, had ordered a cup of latte at the cafe on September 15, 2020. Its price mentioned on the display counter was ₹160.When he got a bill for ₹173, he was surprised as the taxes did not amount to ₹13. When he objected, the person behind the counter told him that ₹5 have been added as packaging charges, and further ₹8 are taxed on the final amount of ₹165. Not satisfied, Singh moved the consumer court. Now, finding the cafe indulging in trade malpractice, the district consumer disputes redressal commission, Mohali, has imposed ₹25,000 punitive charges on Barista Coffee Company Limited, to be deposited in the legal aid fund.The firm has also been asked to refund ₹5 to the complainant and pay him a consolidated compensation of ₹5,000 for mental agony, harassment and litigation expenses.‘Charges not displayed’In his complaint, Singh had alleged that packaging charges were not mentioned in the advertisement or the menu card or the display board of cafe. He contended that the act and conduct of Barista in showing different rates on the display board and not disclosing the actual price exchange amounts to deficiency in service and unfair trade practice. Denying all allegations as “false and misconceived”, Barista said it serves food and beverages to its customers for consumption at the coffee shop only. “It is prominently declared/displayed at the coffee shop that packaging charges are separately chargeable for takeaway orders and intimation in this regard is also given to such customers before billing,” stated the reply.However, the consumer commission ruled that there was nothing on record to prove Barista’s claim. “We feel, that the customer cannot be given surprise once he orders one cup of coffee at a price of ₹160, which is also otherwise a highly exorbitant amount. We feel, that deficiency in service and malpractice on the part of the Barista is proved on the file.” Coming down heavily on the cafe, the commission stated: “(It) must have collected thousands of rupees from various customers in such a manner. In order to curb such malpractice, it is important to impose special cost on (it) so that correct message should go in the society and such traders will think a thousand times before adopting this practice again.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/barista-penalised-30-000-for-billing-5-as-packaging-charges-101636830474789.html
14-11-2021||Chandigarh||Tricity buzz: Orchid flower named after PU woman professor||Professor Promila Pathak, chairperson of Panjab University’s botany department, now has an orchid hybrid named after her. The honour has been bestowed upon her on the basis of significant contributions and achievements in the field of Indian orchidology. The flower named “Phalaenopsis Promila Pathak White” has been registered at Royal Horticultural Society, London. Orchidaceae, commonly called the orchid family, is a diverse and widespread family of flowering plants. Prof Pathak has been instrumental in developing strategies for sustainable development of these flowers. Congress councillors make U-turn, all praise for Mitra From brickbats to bouquets, there’s been a total transformation in the response of Congress councillors towards the working of Chandigarh Municipal Corporation commissioner Anindita Mitra. During the last MC house meet a fortnight ago, the Congress councillors, particularly Satish Kainth, gunned for Mitra on the parking problem. But on November 12, the Congress councillors were all praise for the commissioner, that too on the same issue. Kainth applauded the commissioner for ensuring improvement in parking lots, while his party colleague Devinder Singh Babla praised Mitra for the quick response in replacing a manhole cover. The change in the Congress councillors’ behaviour didn’t go unnoticed by the ruling BJP members. Taking a dig at Babla, BJP councillor Davesh Moudgil said, “Aap aise hi tareef karte rahiye, aur hum dhakan badalte rahenge.” Race against time, BJP on inauguration spree The BJP members of the Municipal Corporation of Chandigarh are on a foundation stone laying and inauguration spree with the deadline of November 17 set for all such programmes. The ruling party wants to have as many achievements as possible to its credit in the run-up to the elections in December. The UT administration is also rushing to inaugurate its own projects, including the start of electric buses and the opening of the aviary before November 17. The state election commission can announce the code of conduct any day after that. UT district court website needs spell check When it comes to spellings of names, one should be accurate. The website of the Chandigarh district courts needs a spell check. The names of many an advocate has been spelt wrong. The name of senior advocate Rabindra Pandit is one such case in point. RWAs back residents, not party or candidate While some members of resident welfare associations (RWAs) have announced their candidacy for the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation elections, people have raised questions about the neutrality of RWA bodies. The Chandigarh Residents’ Association Welfare Federation (CRAWFED) chief spokesperson Anish Garg said, “Whoever wants to stand for elections is free to do so but CRAWFED will not back any candidate or support any party. We will only highlight issues of residents.” Ward division leaves Manimajra confused With the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation elections approaching, residents of Manimajra that has been split into three wards are not clear yet about which ward they come under. A resident said, “Most people see Manimajra as the old township and the new one. It is tedious going over the notification to see which neighbourhood is under which ward.” All three wards are reserved for general category women candidates, adding to the confusion among political parties, too. A party insider said even if one ward had been open for men, it would have worked for the parties but the recent decision has only added to the confusion. Outsourced staff make up for shortage at hospitals The UT health department had on October 1 discontinued the services of 81 outsourced healthcare workers, who had been recruited to handle the Covid-19 pandemic. The department also planned to terminate the services of 150 more such employees as the coronavirus cases subsided. However, after the department terminated the services of 179 NHM employees for protesting against the revised working conditions for a salary hike, the health department didn’t terminate the services of the outsourced staff. Instead, they were hired in place of NHM employees to manage patient care facilities at government hospitals and dispensaries. “We are using their services to meet the manpower requirement in hospitals. The department will soon recruit new NHM employees by following the procedure,” says Dr Suman Singh, director of health services, Chandigarh. Elected senators await gazette notification The process of senate elections of Panjab University (PU) was completed last month, but the elected candidates are still awaiting the gazette notification. According to the PU Act, the senate election is subject to the approval of the PU chancellor, who is the vice-president of India. Though a gazette notification for nominated members has already been issued, it is pending for elected candidates, resulting in further delay in the constitution of the new senate. The senate elections were held after a delay of one year.

14-11-2021||Chandigarh||Panchkula court lets off murder accused suffering from psychotic disorder||A Panchkula court has acquitted a 23-year-old man of murdering his stepfather, as he is suffering from a psychotic disorder. The court has also directed the Haryana government to ensure that he gets proper medical treatment for his mental health.Sanjay Kumar had bludgeoned the victim, Budh Ram, to death with a stick at their home in Chandimandir’s Mau village on March 20, 2017. He had confessed to the crime, saying that he got irritated with his stepfather, who was pestering him to work fast while cleaning some dry grass.He also told police that his parents were living separately and he used to reside with his mother in Himachal Pradesh. Budh Ram had brought him to Mau just two months before the incident. During the court proceedings, legal aid counsel Manbir Singh Rathi threw light on Sanjay’s mental condition and moved the plea of not guilty by reason of insanity. Following this, a medical board was constituted and it found that Sanjay was suffering from schizophrenia-like psychotic disorder and was of unsound mind.Even his relatives stated that Sanjay used to show signs of some mental disorder as he used to talk to himself, laugh when he was sitting alone and consume meals again within a short interval.One of the doctors of the medical board said that in this psychotic disorder, the patient cannot distinguish between good or bad, and keeps having hallucinations and illusions. Stating that there is no permanent cure, the doctor recommended continuous treatment.Even the medical officer of the Ambala jail, where Sanjay was lodged during the trial, said: “Sanjay remains alright till he is under medication, but if even a single dose is missed, he becomes aggressive and starts attacking others.”After hearing all sides, the sessions court acquitted Sanjay of the murder charge, giving him benefit under Section 84 (act of a person of unsound mind) of the Indian Penal Code.Sessions judge Deepak Gupta observed: “Once it has been found that the accused has been of unsound mind/insane and there is no permanent cure for the disease and that he can be managed only by way of giving medicines, the duty of the court does not finish by merely recording his acquittal.”The court directed the state government to admit the accused in any of the mental hospitals or centers, where adequate facilities for his treatment are available. “Accused shall be released from any of such centre, as and when he is found fit to be released,” the judge observed.“Before parting with the judgment, this court will be failing its duty, in case it does not record its appreciation for the hard work put in by Manbir Singh Rathi, legal aid counsel, in bringing to the notice of the court the mental condition of the accused and then assisting the court in reaching to the right conclusion and for restoration of the mental health of accused,” the sessions judge mentioned in his ruling.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/panchkula-court-lets-off-murder-accused-suffering-from-psychotic-disorder-101636830472246.html

The documents have been scanned, catalogued, and put in boxes, unlike the previous method of just placing them in large sacks. These village-wise bar-coded and tamperproof boxes are under round-the-clock CCTV surveillance, said in-charge Manmohan Sharma. District revenue officer (DRO) Rajbir Dhiman said: “Database of jamabandi, intekal, consolidation records, field books, etc, dating back to 1886 in Urdu and Hindi languages, as they existed, has been created under the project.”The DRO said the digitisation will not only save time of the employees engaged in finding the papers, but the records will also remain safe in case of fire or other disasters.Deputy commissioner Vikram said that an applicant will get a copy of the document required at the earliest, after paying the required charges and getting the patwari’s approval.“Later, we will also explore the option of providing online payment options to applicants, who will be able get the document digitally signed online,” he said.Officials have earlier raised the issue of unavailability of “original and authentic record” related to the excise land of Ambala Sadar in Cantonment that were burnt during the Mandal Commission Agitation in 1990. The then SDM (Cantt) had written to the directorate of urban local bodies asking for guidance to verify the revenue applications at his office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/revenue-records-just-a-click-away-in-ambala-101636830471045.html
14-11-2021||Chandigarh||Auto major Maruti Suzuki to get 900 acres in Sonepat||Automobile giant Maruti Suzuki India Ltd (MSIL) will be allotted about 900 acres at Industrial Model Township (IMT) Kharkhauda in Sonepat for setting up car and motorcycle manufacturing units. The allotment, officials said, will entail an investment of 18,000 crore, one of the biggest in recent times.Officials said the 900 acres being allotted to the auto giant will fetch ₹2,500-2,700 crore for the state exchequer.A decision to this effect was taken during a meeting of the Haryana Enterprise Promotion Board (HEPB) headed by chief minister ML Khattar in Gurugram on Saturday. MSIL chairman RC Bhargava and top functionaries were also present during the meeting. The country’s largest car manufacturer plans to gradually shift its manufacturing operations from the Gurugram facility to IMT Kharkhauda once the new unit get commissioned. The relocation has been necessitated due to growing congestion and traffic snarls in Gurugram. Officials said the car manufacturing unit will come on 800 acres and the Suzuki motorcycle unit will be set up on 100 acres at IMT Kharkhauda.The finalisation of expansion and relocation plans at IMT Kharkhauda, officials said, were delayed due to issues pertaining to reimbursement of State Goods and Services Tax (SGST) and the newly enacted law providing for 75% reservation for locals in private sector jobs. “We have been able to iron out these issues and a broad agreement has been reached on the incentives to be provided to the company.

14-11-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai crosses 100% first dose coverage; time to think about Covid booster shots||Vaccination is an intervention for specific purposes, which change over time. When the national Covid vaccination campaign was rolled out (January 16), the initial focus was the health and lives of frontline workers (healthcare, sanitation, police etc), so that they could work with safety and confidence. On March 1, the net was widened to cover citizens above 60 years, and those above 45 years with co-morbidities — the most vulnerable groups for severe disease and death. From April 1, all adults above 45 years were allowed to access vaccines. These policy choices were essentially to meet medical needs, to reduce numbers of Covid patients requiring hospitalisation and intensive care. The next phase was from May 1, when all adults (18 years and above) could get the vaccine. The purpose was now shifted to public health needs, for if the purpose was to reduce hospitalisations and deaths, then the age group of 18 to 45 years would not have been priority. This inclusive approach to mass vaccination for all adults was for us to reach “herd immunity threshold” (HIT) in an attempt to bring the epidemic on its knees, and at worst, allow it to crawl as endemic Covid — with low and steady numbers. Unrecognised by Covid watchers, India reached HIT, thanks to the second wave by the Delta variant. The epidemic peaked on May 6 (414,433 cases), dropped to 50,174 (seven-day moving average) on June 27 and since then the numbers had been steadily coming down — it was around 40,000 on September 9; 30,000 on September 24; 20,000 on October 8; 15,000 on October 27. This is the endemic phase of Covid lasting 20 consecutive weeks. Now there is no more need for universal coverage for reaching HIT. It is time to shift the strategy to meet our current needs. First, let’s recognise what an endemic phase means. Infections will continue. Covid cases will remain low in numbers. So, who are those sources of the virus who are responsible for continued transmission? They are: unvaccinated persons below 18; unvaccinated adults; and persons with breakthrough infections (due to waning immunity after the two-dose vaccination) and re-infections (with waning post-infection immunity). This is good news, but why has mortality gone up recently? The daily deaths reached its lowest of 160 on October 20, but increased step-wise to 803 on October 28, and have not yet returned to 160 — on November 12 it was 555. Information about those who die and why is not yet in public domain. What we do know: men above 60, all with co-morbidities, all on chronic medication that suppress immunity, and those with cancers and transplants respond to two vaccine doses with sub-optimal immunity. All of them deserve booster doses to better their chances of survival. Dampening the tempo of virus circulation will lead to fewer infections and lesser deaths. For that, breakthrough infections must be prevented by giving booster doses to all who come forward. There is apprehension, amplified by the World Health Organisation (WHO) that a booster dose deprives someone waiting for second dose. If vaccines were in short supply, that is reasonable. However, India has unused vaccine stocks in several states and institutions — thus, a policy shift allowing boosters will be a wise and ethical decision. When should booster jabs be given? The best time is six months to one year after the second dose — a standard practise being followed around the world. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) must monitor the effect of boosters. In a few weeks we will know if they are life-saving and protecting against severe Covid, in comparison with those who did not get booster doses.(Dr. T.

14-11-2021||Pune||World Diabetes Day: Uncontrolled diabetes can cause joint and nerve damage, say doctors||Pune: Every year, November 14 is celebrated as World Diabetes Day to raise awareness regarding the non-communicable lifestyle disease. However, despite being a diabetic capital of the world for a while, Indians is now paying serious attention as Covid-19 has brought back the attention to comorbid patients they are highly vulnerable to the infection. City doctors have warned that if not controlled diabetes could lead to damages to other organs and body systems. Diabetes can cause various musculoskeletal diseases which gets neglected most commonly. A majority of type 2 diabetes patients, encounter joint pain, neuropathy pain, and muscle ache. It is essential for those having diabetes to keep blood sugar levels check frequently and keep diabetes in control with daily exercise and follow a well-balanced diet to keep their joint and muscles intact, according to medical experts. As per the Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) last survey on comorbidity under the ‘My Family My Responsibility’ scheme, during the Covid pandemic, 402,343 people were found to be comorbid of which 140,926 reported only diabetes and 63,407 reported diabetes and high blood pressure as well. The central government has estimated that Pune city’s population is 4,210,592 which mean that about 4.85% of the city’s population which has reported are diabetic. A city diabetologist said, “A large number of people are having diabetes that not only invites heart or kidney problems but even joint involvement. For example - A 64-year-old patient is diabetic since 12 years and having complaints of loss of balance and difficulty in walking. In another case, a patient who was teacher by profession was suffering through both shoulder pain radiating up to hand and diagnosed with high blood sugar levels. After several clinical examination and X-rays with nerve conduction test, was diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy and frozen shoulder respectively. There are many such patients who have joint and nerve problems due to diabetes. If diabetes is not managed in time there will be undiagnosed breakdown of musculoskeletal system causing joint pain and limited range of motion.” Dr Snehal Desai, diabetologist, Lokmanya Hospital Pune said, “Diabetes leads to unwanted changes in the musculoskeletal system, that is the muscles, bones, joints, ligaments, and tendons impacting the fingers, hands, wrists, shoulders, neck, spine, or feet. One with uncontrolled diabetes having joint pain will encounter symptoms like muscle pain, joint pain or stiffness, lessened ability to move your joints, joint swelling, deformities, and pricking sensation or loss of sensation in the arms or legs. Carpal tunnel syndrome is frequently seen in people with diabetes, as is trigger finger (a catching or locking of the fingers). The shoulder joint may also be affected by diabetes with cause of frozen shoulder. Thus, one will not be able to carry on daily activities with ease. Diabetic neuropathy can lead to numbness in the feet and ankles. Over time, one may feel little or no sensation in these areas. People with diabetes can also get arthritis which can leave them crippled for life.” Dr Vishwajeet Chavan, orthopaedic surgeon from Apollo Spectra hospital, Pune said, “Diabetes could lead to arthritis, but this chance is seen more in high-risk diabetes patients. While, the patients suffering from diabetes for many years may also have arthritis issue. However, not every diabetes patient suffers from arthritis. The cases of arthritis with diabetes patients are less. Due to osteroporosis or infection may cause damage to the spinal cord or knee joints. Besides, the patient may also experience lack of blood and could lead to joint pains. Therefore, diabetes patient should take utmost care of their health.” Dr CS Yajnik, director, diabetes unit, KEM said, “Despite malnutrition, India is the diabetes capital. Diabetes is brought on by unhealthy diet, sedentary lifestyle and stress in people who are predisposed. Predisposition can be partly genetic for which there is no treatment. Recent research has shown that predisposition can also come from undernutrition when growing in the mother’s womb or pregnancy diabetes. These two conditions are in plenty in India, and may be prevented or treated effectively. If we improve the nutrition and metabolism of the young, it will benefit not only them but also their children.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/world-diabetes-day-uncontrolled-diabetes-can-cause-joint-nerve-damage-say-doctors-101636830111982.html
14-11-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body official: Initial phase and last mile are the most challenging||Mumbai: From storing vaccines to going all-digital were some of the big challenges faced by the city’s civic authorities in the adult vaccination drive against the Covid pandemic, Dr Sheela Jagtap, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) immunisation officer said. “When the drive began in Mumbai, storing the vaccines was a major challenge. The city had a small cold storage facility at BMC’s F-South ward office in Parel, where the Covid-19 vaccines were stored in the initial phase. In April, a central storage facility was opened at Kanjurmarg. Both Covishield and Covaxin have to be stored in two to eight degrees Celsius. The Kanjurmarg facility was equipped with two walk-in coolers which could store up to 10 million vaccine doses,” Jagtap said. This national vaccination programme was also unique in its all-digital approach. For civic authorities around the country, this meant collecting and entering information at a scale that they hadn’t done before. “The Centre had given us a template to update all data like mobile numbers, Aadhar number etc, which would then be uploaded on the CoWin portal. At a time, the system allowed us to enter details of 1000 beneficiaries only. And even if a digit was missed in any phone number, or any other incorrect information was entered, it would reject the upload entirely,” Jagtap said. To make things smoother, the civic body used master trainers “in data uploading processes”. “It also helped that beneficiaries could upload their own details at later stage of the drive,” she said. According to Jagtap, the last mile coverage is the biggest challenge the civic body faces now. “There could be some hesitancy. We now hope to reach up to the last vaccinated person by house-to-house drive.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-official-initial-phase-and-last-mile-are-the-most-challenging-101636830110681.html
14-11-2021||Chandigarh||Farmers in Jind, Dadri dists queue up for days to get DAP||Farmers in Jind and Dadri districts of Haryana have been queuing up for days to get a few sacks of di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) fertiliser for their lands for the rabi season. Authorities, however, say there is no dearth of the fertiliser in the state. Amarjeet Singh, a Jind farmer, said he prepared his three acres four days ago to sow wheat but he is yet to get a bag of the DAP.“We never imagined that we would have to spend days in queues to get a bag of the DAP. For the first time, the fertiliser is being given to farmers after verifying Aadhaar card amid police security. Farmers start queuing up outside fertiliser shops as early as 6am, but many of them had to return empty-handed after eight hours of wait,” he said.Similar situation prevails in Charkhi Dadri district where farmers say they had to return empty-handed after standing in queues for hours.Amandeep Sheoran, a farmer from Charkhi Dadri, said farmers struggle to get DAP for mustard cultivation and now they are facing a similar situation for wheat sowing.“If we do not get DAP on time, wheat sowing will be delayed. Many shopkeepers under the patronage of officials are transporting the DAP to neighbouring Rajasthan and the government has failed to take action against them,” he alleged.Uchana block agriculture officer Pawan Bhardwaj said each farmer was given a maximum of five bags of DAP after verifying their Aadhaar card.Haryana Agriculture minister JP Dalal said there is no dearth of DAP in the state.“During this rabi season, three lakh MT DAP has been allocated to the state, which is 20% more than the average of the last five years. The farmers should buy DAP and other fertilisers as per their requirements,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farmers-in-jind-dadri-dists-queue-up-for-days-to-get-dap-101636829992173.html

The tour lasted for one-and-a-half hour. We raised various concerns.”“Elected members and citizens pointed out various errors in the existing works and appealed the administration to complete the road works in the next one-and-a-half months. It was also decided to increase coordination between departments and finish the digging works as there would then be no need to do these repeatedly,” Rasne said. “Kasba Vishrambaug will be the model on whose lines steps will be taken in all ward offices and wards, and works will be completed in the next one-and-a-half months,” he added.Kumar said, “Elected members gave various suggestions. The administration will study the same and chalk out a plan for execution.” With the condition of roads having worsened due to drainage and water pipeline works, resurfacing of all the main roads will be carried out.The civic body’s renewed focus on completing all works, especially road works, just ahead of the municipal elections, is seen as the Bhartiya Janta Party’s last-ditch attempt to make good on their election promise of planning and executing the development of all wards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/vikram-kumar-dept-heads-review-works-in-kasba-vishrambaug-other-peth-areas-101636829990631.html
14-11-2021||Mumbai||‘Everyone in Mumbai has not received the first vaccine dose’||Mumbai: While Mumbai may have statistically achieved the milestone of 100% full dose coverage, the city will have to administer many more doses to truly cover its entire adult population. Reason: an estimated 10% to 20% people who have got the Covid-19 vaccine in Mumbai are likely to be people from other parts of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) or rest of Maharashtra. “We are definitely accounting for this slight mismatch, and therefore, our vaccination drive will continue aggressively,” said Mumbai’s executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare. “We will have to reach much beyond 100%,” she said. The nationwide Covid-19 vaccination drive began on January 16. While it was opened in phases starting with health care workers, frontline workers and then for the senior citizens and people above 45 years with comorbid conditions. By April, the city had started grappling with vaccine shortages. Similar shortages were felt in other parts of the MMR. “Since Mumbai had more vaccination centres, many people from other parts of MMR travelled to get a jab in Mumbai. At the same time, people from Mumbai also travelled outside to get the jabs as there were phases of severe shortages when people could not find vaccine slots here,” said Dr Gomare adding that it is hard to estimate the exact number of other residents who have taken the shots in Mumbai centres. Going by the rough estimates, the civic body plans to achieve an additional 10% to 20% coverage and continue to drive to expand the second dose coverage. FEBRUARY TARGET FOR 100% TWO DOSE COVERAGE Over six million second doses have been administered in the city, taking the full vaccination coverage to 65%. According to Dr Gomare, the civic body is hopeful to cover the entire target population with two doses by February. “We have already written to the Centre urging them to reduce the 84-day gap between two doses of Covishield. Now that we have the vaccine doses as well as the capacity to administer them, we will be able to fully immunise our population much faster if the gap is reduced,” she said. A majority of the doses (over 13 million) administered in Mumbai were of Covishield manufactured by the Serum Institute of India. The Centre has mandated a 84-day gap between two doses of Covishield. More than 1.4 million doses were of Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin which has 28 day gap between two doses. A little over 55,800 doses were of Sputnik V by Russia’s Gamaleya Research Institute which had a 21 day gap between two doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/everyone-in-mumbai-has-not-received-the-first-vaccine-dose-101636829870541.html

The fourth accused, Amit, has been sent to three-day police remand.Kharkhauda assistant superintendent of police Myank Gupta said they will interrogate the accused on their motive behind the crime. Barak and Dahiya were the prime suspects in the case and were absconding. The Haryana police had announces ₹1 lakh reward for information leading to their arrest.The reports of the murder triggered confusion as the university-level wrestler was a namesake of a bronze medal winner at the Under-23 World Championship.In her statement to Haryana Police, Dhanpati alleged the Barak, also the owner of the academy, fired at them after her daughter accused him of harassing her. “My daughter told me earlier too that Pawan often misbehaved with her. When we talked to the accused about this, he promised not to repeat such acts,” she added.She said on Wednesday, her daughter went to the academy for training and returned home. “At 1pm, she went to the academy again. We received a call from Pawan saying Nisha was not feeling well, and he asked us to take her home. When I and my son Suraj reached there, we saw Pawan, his wife Sujata, and two others rushing towards Nisha near the main gate of the academy. She told me that Pawan had misbehaved with her and threatened to kill her if she narrated the incident to anyone.”Barak then allegedly pulled out a gun and fired multiple shots. “She collapsed after receiving bullet wounds. Pawan then fired shots at me and chased my son Suraj, who was running towards the village. I saw them firing several bullets, which hit him and he too died on the spot.”Woman boxer’s body found in bathroom The body of a 21-year-old woman boxer was found in a bathroom at her rented accommodation at Sonepat’s Kharkhauda, police said on Saturday.The deceased was identified as Bhavna, 21, of Uttar Pradesh’s Mavikalan village of Baghpat district and she has been staying along with other women players at a rented accommodation at Kharkhauda for the past two-and-a-half months.A police spokesman said the incident took place when the woman player had gone inside a bathroom to take a bath on Friday night.“When she did not return, her friends sounded the alert.

14-11-2021||Pune||Pune vax centres see less beneficiaries, non-Covid programmes hit by lack of staff||Pune: Post Diwali, the vaccine demands have further gone down as people are not turning out at vaccination centres. Despite the administration allocating manpower and infrastructure for inoculation, the demand from beneficiaries has gone down due to reasons like people going out of town for the festival celebration, decrease in need for vaccine as the number of cases drop and those who have taken the first dose do not seem to be enthusiast to get the second dose. However, this has left the civic body’s health programmes in a catch-22 situation as the staff is dedicated for only one job, vaccination, which is not getting much of a response. A senior doctor from PMC health department said, “The other national programmes have been stuck as the staff has been diverted towards the vaccination centres. Since the beginning of November, the demand for vaccines has gone down and fully staffed centres are seen empty the entire day. Keeping these centres for half a day, first or second half, will allow other programmes to run parallelly. But, now non-covid work is pending.” As of Saturday, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has administered 5,195,980 of which 3,221,319 have got the first dose and 1,974,661 have got the second dose. Earlier, PMC had announced that the entire eligible population in Pune city had got the first dose which means that 1,246,658 people have yet to get their second dose. As per the PMC’s earlier claims, 100% of the city’s eligible population has got their first dose and now only second dose beneficiaries are pending to get the vaccine. Since November, despite the steady flow of vaccines and fully manned vaccination centres, the response from beneficiaries has been poor. However, due to the current guidelines in place, PMC has to keep all its centres manned for the entire day to ensure no beneficiary is forced to leave due to no vaccine or staff. The doctor said that insufficient staff is seen at maternity homes even as admissions have gone back to pre-Covid times. Dr Ashish Bharti, PMC chief health officer, said, “As of now, we are working as per the guidelines wherein we are required to man the vaccination centres. We have already restarted Dalvi Hospital, Bopodi hospital and Laigude hospital. Despite this, we have asked our staff to attend to the nearest OPDs in case there is no rush at the vaccination centre.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-vax-centres-see-less-beneficiaries-non-covid-programmes-hit-by-lack-of-staff-101636829750573.html
14-11-2021||Mumbai||‘Mumbai will be fully vaccinated by December’||Brihanmumbai Municipal Commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal, in an exclusive interview to HT, speaks of how the city reached the first-dose milestone. While expressing confidence that the city will be fully vaccinated by the end of the year, he also says the BMC is prepared for a third wave, if it comes. Excerpts: Mumbai achieved the milestone of 100% vaccination of the first dose, for the target population of the city. Your thoughts?I am very happy and proud of my team at BMC, who have excelled from Day One. We achieved 100% vaccination of eligible population, and we are the only city of a comparable size, in the country to achieve this milestone. Not only that, we have achieved 65% double dose vaccination also. We just have to vaccinate 3,30,000 more people. In the next 30-45 days, we can vaccinate the remaining population also. By the end of December, which is just 45 days away, we should be the first (globally comparable) city in the world to achieve 100% double dose vaccination of its eligible population. The results of our effort are already visible, as on Friday, we had only one Covid-related death in Mumbai, and today our positivity rate has gone down to 0.7%.What does this mean for the anticipated third wave? Does Mumbai have more immunity as a city?First and foremost, we are fully prepared for a third wave. We have enough oxygen storage and manufacturing capacity. We have also built four new jumbo facilities. We have already procured 5000 vials of monoclonal antibodies, which will be very important if a third wave comes. We have groomed thousands of doctors in the last four months.But I have to say, based on what experts tell me: when we are 100% vaccinated even for the first dose, the gravity of infection greatly reduces. Out of 1.5 crore vaccination, only 16,000 were infected, which is negligible.What interventions have helped Mumbai?A very streamlined system. We were the first municipality who asked the health ministry to let private hospitals come on board. We were the first who said students travelling to foreign countries should be allowed to get the second dose of Covishield in 28 days. We were the first to get pregnant women vaccinated.We continue to be the first and only city in India, to have a unique model - corporate houses, private hospitals, and BMC, signed an agreement, where 25% of the stocks of manufacturing companies like Serum Institute could be purchased by private hospitals. We asked corporates to fund private hospitals, who acquired the stock, and gave the vaccines to BMC. We pumped these vaccines to slum areas where we conducted free vaccination. It is unique to Mumbai, and we have achieved almost one million vaccinations like this. If we had not adopted this model, we would not be where we are now.Due to some vaccine hesitancy, we went to celebrities like Salman Khan way back in July. He made a complimentary video for BMC, where he asked his 60 million followers to take the vaccine. Such videos went viral all over Mumbai. On August 15, when local trains started in Mumbai, we said only double vaccinated people could travel by train, or enter restaurants or shopping malls. This encouraged people to get vaccinated. Today, 6 million people travel by the local train, all double vaccinated. Thousands of people have taken the vaccine, not for Covid, but for a train pass, as their livelihood depends on it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-will-be-fully-vaccinated-bydecember-101636829690773.html

A 2014-batch IPS, Sanjiv Suman, was appointed the new SP of Lakhimpur Kheri replacing Vijay Dhull who was transferred late Thursday evening and attached with the Uttar Pradesh state police headquarters in Lucknow. Talking to media persons on Saturday, Suman said a peculiar problem of traffic mismanagement in Lakhimpur city has drawn his attention. “Narrow roads and lack of parking places had compounded the problem. I would ensure that traffic on the roads runs smoothly while for some infrastructural issues I would coordinate with respective authorities,” he said. Suman, who has earlier served in Bulandsahr, Azamgarh, Kanpur, Hapur and Lucknow in different capacities, took note of the common grievance of communication gap between the media and the police particularly regarding Tikunia case and said he would look into the issue. Regarding the October 3 Tikunia violence in which eight people were killed, Suman said the special investigation team (SIT) was smoothly conducting the probe into the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/new-kheri-sp-takes-charge-sets-priorities-101636829570445.html

PMPML bus shelters in Hadapsar, Fatima nagar, (near) Sassoon hospital, Bhandarkar road, Kumthekar road, Dandekar pul and Yerawada are all in bad condition with roof covers missing or crooked seats or in many places, tilted pillars.Nilkanth Mandhare, member of the PMP Pravasi Manch, said, “The problem with PMPML is that even if they carry out repairs, they do so only in core areas such as Shivajinagar and Swargate but what about the other areas. The situation is so bad in the inner parts of the city that even if people have to wait for buses, they have to stand in the Sun as shade is completely missing and this problem has been there since months with no action taken by PMPML.”Popular perception is that PMPML has always been lackadaisical when it comes to repair work. Two people were injured after a bus shelter collapsed at Moledina road opposite SGS mall on August 13. Daily commuter and resident of M G road, Ishan Shinde, said, “No one has bothered to erect a bus shelter again. It has remained the same for months now. A majority of the bus shelters in the Camp area are crooked but no repair works have been carried out either by the Pune Cantonment Board or the PMPML.”On her part, Chetna Kerure, joint managing director, PMPML, said, “The depot development project is in process. Tenders are ready and will be shortly floated.”While PMPML now plans to extend its service to suburban areas, the move hasn’t gone down well with city commuters who feel that PMPML does not provide stress-free transport. “Why is PMPML not spending money on repair works instead of planning new routes? Firstly, they should take care of the city-based routes where daily footfalls are higher and people are still not getting basic facilities,” said Tuhin Deb, a commuter from Baner.In and around Pune, there are 5,419 bus shelters with PMPML buses operating along 413 bus routes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/commuters-suffer-as-pmpml-bus-shelters-continue-to-be-in-bad-shape-across-pune-city-101636829512005.html
14-11-2021||Bangalore||Learnt coding in Class 4, says hacker Srikrishna at centre of Bitcoin row||The man at the centre of a political battle between the Karnataka’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Opposition over an alleged multi crore bitcoin scam has claimed that he began learning coding when he was in Class 4 and was part of a group of that hacked a cryptocurrency exchange five years ago.Srikrishna Ramesh, alias Sriki, was arrested by the Central Crime Branch (CCB) of police on November 17, 2020, and during his interrogation, CCB found that he was involved in a series of online crimes. He confessed to hacking and stealing from three Bitcoin exchanges, 14 company websites, including 10 poker websites, and a government portal.A statement given by the hacker, which is part of the charge sheet against him and police claims was voluntary, gives a glimpse of the life of Srikrishna, who by his own account was a genius. These details are information provided by the hacker in his voluntary statement, which has not been corroborated by the police. Police are trying to verify the claims and HT cannot independently verify the them. His lawyers have opposed the claims in the charge sheet in a local Bengaluru court.In his statement, Srikrishna claims that he started learning technical skills when he was as young as 8-year-old. The hacker claimed he began learning the programming language Java when he was in Class 4.“In Class 4, I learned the basics of web exploitation, Java, Reverse engineering and wrote my first bot for a game called RuneScape. This was my first attempt at reverse engineering obfuscated games and binary exploitation,” he wrote in his statement to the police.In the coming years, he joined an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) channel used by a group of black hat hackers (unethical hackers). According to him, he learned hacking from the members of this channel.“Picking up skills slowly as a script kiddie, I learned the basics of databases, SQL injections, local file inclusions, remote file inclusions, remote code executions, shells, web application exploitation, and source code analysis,” the hacker wrote about his activities during school days.Starting as a rookie in hacking, over the years he learned sophisticated knowledge in illegal hacking of websites and others. Later, Srikrishna was promoted as the moderator of the channel’s forum and an administrator of the IRC network when he was in Class 9. During this time, he began making friends in the international hacking circles, with many of them mentoring him in financial hacking.By the time he finished schooling, he was earning hundreds of dollars every month, by hacking into an online game along with a hacker friend from Sydney. It was during this pre-university (10+2), he learned about Bitcoins. “When I learned about Bitcoins the price was around $100 (per coin),” he wrote in the statement.Srikrishna first used bitcoins to purchase drugs from the darknet market. “Due to the pseudo-anonymous nature of bitcoin, a person by the names of ‘Ross Ulbricht’ made the first darknet market from which I initially imported drugs to India for personal consumption. This market was called Silk Road 1.0. I ordered several packages in two years which all successfully cleared customs,” he wrote.The hacker claims that by the end of the two years of college, he was addicted to drugs and left home at the age of 17. “I ran away to the Himalayas at the age of 17 with my friend Rithvik and ended up in Badrinath. A case was registered at Siddapura police station (Missing persons) and Tilaknagar police station (By Rithvik’s mother). Eventually, due to a technical folly, the Tilaknagar Police found us at ISKCON in Mathura and brought us back to Bangalore,” wrote the hacker.On his return, after dropping out of engineering from Bengaluru college, he joined B.Sc. in Computer Science at the Eindhoven University of Technology in Amsterdam. It was here, he learned more about Bitcoins. In Amsterdam, two of his friends started a bitcoin exchange, and working with them, he learned about bitcoin trading, which he later used for hacking into bitcoin exchanges.Srikrishna returned to Bengaluru in 2015 and it was in 2018, he had his first brush with the law. On February 18, 2018, Shantinagar Congress MLA NA Haris’ son Nalapad was accused of brutally assaulting a man in a cafe in Bengaluru’s UB City mall. Srikrishna who was by then friends with the MLA’s son was accused number three in the case. While all other accused in the case were arrested, Srikrishna managed to evade arrest by changing cities multiple times, before he could get bail.In his statement, Srikrishna then listed out all hacking cases that he has been part of. According to police investigating the case, he told the police about these instances as though they were big achievements of his life. “He started by talking about how he hacked his college website to give proxy attendance to his friends. He emphasised the fact that he didn’t take any money for that. He also said that he hacked several websites to get movie tickets and IPL tickets for his friends. Once again he emphasised that he didn’t take any money for that,” said a senior Bengaluru police officer who didn’t want to be named.“Like most of the criminals he wants to be famous and he wants to be known as, in his own words, a cool hacker. The statement at one point began looking bragging. We are still unable to ascertain a lot of claims made by them, where he claims to have hacked into websites and servers. Even though he knows the consequences of admitting to hacking these sites, he can’t help himself,” the officer added.“Bitfinex was my first big bitcoin exchange hack; the exchange was hacked twice, and I was the first person to do so,” read his description of the 2016 hacking of the Bitcoin exchange. Around 120,000 bitcoins, which was about $72 million at the time, were stolen from Bitfinex in August 2016.“The second instance was a simple spear-phishing attack that led to two Israeli hackers working for the army getting access to the computers of one of the employees, which gave them access to the AWS cloud account,” he wrote about the hack.It was this hacking instance that has now made Srikrishna a person of interest in the political battle between the Congress and ruling BJP. The Congress has alleged a cover-up and a link between the hacker and BJP, alleging that Bengaluru police, who had information about his involvement in December 2020, didn’t reveal this information to central enforcement agencies until April 2021.Apart from questioning the police hiding information about Srikrishna to central agencies, the Opposition has also alleged that ₹9 crore worth of bitcoins seized from the Srikrishna following his arrest in November 2020, was not shown in the charge sheet or the evidence submitted before the court.But for Srikrishna, his downfall didn’t begin with the hacking or his involvement in the brawl in 2018. It was his drug addiction that got him behind the bars. In November 2020, officers of the Central Crime Branch were on the lookout for drug peddlers in the city, as part of the Home Minister’s orders to crack down on the drug mafia in the city.Based on a tip-off, police approached one Suneesh Hegde who was procuring hydro marijuana through dealers on the darknet. During the questioning Hedge admitted that it was Srikrishna who was helping him procure the drugs. Srikrishna who has been purchasing drugs from the darknet for several years had helped Hedge purchase as a favour.A senior CCB official said that when they got the custody of Srikrishna, they didn’t know they had an infamous hacker under arrest. “It was when we were trying to find out how he was using bitcoins to buy drugs, we came to know about all the hacking cases he was part of. If it wasn’t for that drug case, we would have never found this hacker,” said the police.Prior to his arrest, as per the statement of Robin Khandelwal, an associate of the hacker who converted the bitcoins to cash, Srikrishna used to spend most of his time in five-star hotels. According to Khandelwal, most of the money he transferred to Srikrishna was spent on hotel bills, which often ran into a few lakhs.According to the charge sheet, he also hacked online game sites, including PokerDangal, PokerBaazi, GGpoker, PPpoker, SwC Poker, BitStarz and Spartan Poker. He used to make his friends play poker on these sites, while Srikrishna would hack the sites to see Opponent’s cards. During these hacks, he had lived in a five-star hotel in Goa for over a month, said Khandelwal in his statement.Similarly, when he was on the run after the assault case in Bengaluru, Srikrishna spent ₹11.80 lakh on a private jet for his travel, read the statement.But as the bitcoin scandal is becoming a political tug of war, the concerns for the hacker are increasing. In a petition filed before the court, the hacker’s father Gopal Ramesh has claimed that his son was drugged by police while he was in custody.HT accessed the petition filed by the Srikrishna’s father, which read: “…application was filed by the petitioner being the father of the accused that he has credible and reliable information that the respondents (police) at the behest and unlawful orders have been administering the Petitioner’s son Srikrishna with excessive mind-altering drugs specifically Alprazolam which is a prohibited drug and therefore, sought cognizance be taken against all officials who have committed various offenses under the NDPS Act as also under the IPC.”He further claimed that even though the magistrate ordered a scientific examination of the hacker’s blood and urine samples, police conducted a stomach wash done on him, defying the order. The opposition also produced a document from Victoria Medical College that read that stomach cleaning performed “to rule out poisoning”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/learnt-coding-in-class-4-says-hacker-srikrishna-at-centre-of-bitcoin-row-101636829510504.html
14-11-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: 24x7 water supply project launched in Manimajra||UT administrator Banwarilal Purohit on Saturday laid the foundation stone of 24x7 water supply project at Manimajra. As per the municipal corporation (MC), the project is aimed at switching from intermittent supply to 24x7 continuous pressurised supply system. This project will involve new waterworks with four million gallon of additional storage, 13,700 smart meters, 20km of new lines, and automated monitoring of system. The existing 37 tubewells will be phased out.The project is to be carried out at ₹162 crore, including cost of 15 years’ operation and maintenance. The work is expected to be completed by August 2023.To cover the entire city, the French firm, Agence Française de Développement (AFD) is to provide ₹413 crore for the project in the form of a loan, which is to be repaid in 15 years. In addition to it, the European Union (EU) is also giving a grant of ₹98 crore to the project. In his address, the governor said that residents of Manimajra will highly benefit from this project as the continuous supply system would provide better water quality and households will get better pressure of water sufficient to fill tanks up to third storey, thus lowering the pumping costs. He appreciated the MC for taking various steps to improve the basic upkeep besides ensuring the availability of civic amenities in each sector. He said that public participation is must in understanding the issues, recognising the areas requiring improvement and evolving strategies for future planning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-24x7-water-supply-project-launched-in-manimajra-101636829211997.html
14-11-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai crosses 100% first vaccine dose coverage||Ten months after the nationwide Covid-19 vaccination programme was rolled out on January 16,Mumbai achieved 100% first dose coverage on Saturday. As of 9.30 pm on November 13, 9,253,624 persons had received the first dose of the vaccine that helps guard against severe infection and death by Sars-CoV-2, the virus that has infected 253,436,774 people worldwide. The city’s target adult population is officially 9,236,546. According to the government-run CoWin platform, more than six million (nearly 65% of the target population) had received the second dose in Mumbai as of Saturday night.There are currently two vaccines that form part of the national vaccination programme, and which are being rolled out in the city: Covidshield, manufactured by the Serum India Institute (SII) in Pune and developed by Astra-Zeneca and Oxford University; and Covaxin, an indigenous Covid-19 vaccine developed by Bharat Biotech and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Apart from this, Sputnik produced by Russia’s Gamaleya Research Institute is also available in private centres. There are three other vaccines that have received Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA), but these are not available in the market at present.Mumbai launched the first phase with just 10 vaccinations centres. The city gradually increased the centres — it now has 462 public and private vaccination centres with a capacity to conduct 23,000 vaccinations every day. Getting here was not easy. One of the main challenges that the civic body faced was supply crunch. In the initial days of the national vaccination programme, when it opened up to include all adults above the age of 45 (starting April 1), the supply of vaccines from SII and Bharat Biotech could not match the demand that surged around the country. At the same time, the city also began to experience a deadlier second wave of the pandemic, forcing the state into another partial lockdown between April and August. As a result several vaccine centres remained shut for days on end.The civic body developed a communication strategy that informed people of which centres were open on any given day, and the number of doses available. Even so, many centres ran out of supply leaving citizens stranded. “No other district in the country has managed to reach the 100% target in such short time,” additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said. “It has been a collective effort. We achieved it because of the sincere contribution of all municipal workers, private hospitals, NGOs and people on the ground,” he said. To be sure, the city’s statistical milestone though significant does not imply that every person in Mumbai has received one dose of the vaccine. The civic body estimates that nearly 20% of the population which has received the vaccine came from other parts of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) or other districts. Besides, a small percentage of the population are still choosing to remain unvaccinated due to hesitancy. For instance, a door to door vaccination drive conducted by the Thane Municipal Corporation in the past four days reached out to around 20,000 unvaccinated adults. The BMC has also started a similar exercise to enumerate the number of people who are as yet unvaccinated — BMC field staff are making residential visits around the city to ask Mumbaiites whether they have been vaccinated or not. Their job also entails convincing these persons to get vaccinated and to follow up with residents. Reaching the milestoneAccording to Kakani, decentralising vaccination centres played a crucial role in achieving the target. As the city moves to increase its first dose coverage beyond 100% and achieve the second dose target, new, micro strategies are being designed. “In the coming days, we will implement newer, vigorous strategies to get every single person in the city vaccinated. There will be door to door campaigns, mobile vaccination drives, camps in slums pockets with lower coverage and targets to achieve 100% vaccinations in housing societies. These strategies will help reach us to every single person,” he said. Infectious disease expert and member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force Dr Om Srivastava said, “It definitely means that the city has is more protected, but this should not be taken as an excuse to let our guards down. The virus is unpredictable, and there are countries that are seeing large number of cases even now. France, for instance has now announced that they are experiencing the fifth wave,” he said. According to Srivastava, Russia, which has high vaccination coverage is also going through a similar surge. “It is difficult to predict how the virus will behave in different countries, despite vaccination,” he said. On Friday, World Health Organization’s director general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus highlighted that Covid cases were not only surging in countries in Eastern Europe with lower vaccination rates, but also in countries with some of the world’s highest vaccination rates in Western Europe. ”Mumbai’s has shown us that 100% vaccination is achievable. Other districts in the country should follow suit,” Dr Naveen Thacker, a former representative to GAVI, the vaccine alliance said that coverage offers hope at a time when schools and colleges are reopening and lockdown restrictions have been lifted. “This wide coverage should be a good barrier between the city and the anticipated third wave,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-crosses-100-first-vaccine-dose-coverage-101636829210734.html
14-11-2021||Noida||Noida most polluted for second day in a row, no respite in sight||There seems to be no respite from ‘severe’ air for Ghaziabad, Greater Noida and Noida as pollution levels spiked for the second time this season starting from Friday--the first being around the time of Diwali (November 4)--and led to a rise in PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations. The air quality index (AQI) bulletin of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) indicated that with an AQI of 464, Noida was the most polluted city in the country for the second consecutive day on Saturday. While Ghaziabad recorded an AQI of 441, the AQI of Greater Noida showed a marginal improvement and was at the lower end of the ‘severe’ category at 408 compared to 478 on Friday. An AQI reading between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.Ghaziabad has been reeling under ‘severe’ pollution levels for 10 days since November 4, the day Diwali was celebrated. Noida too has been under the ‘severe’ category for all days, barring November 10. The four monitoring stations in Ghaziabad and two in Greater Noida recorded PM2.5 as the primary pollutant while all the four stations in Noida had PM10 and PM2.5 as the primary pollutants.There has been a major spike in PM10 and PM2.5 levels in Noida and Ghaziabad. According to CPCB data, the first spike in pollution levels lasted from November 4 to 6 and the second spike started on Friday (November 12) and is continuing. According to official figures of the CPCB, the PM2.5 levels ranged between 297.45 micrograms per cubic metre (mpcm) to 691.18 mpcm in Ghaziabad between November 10 to 12. Likewise, the PM10 levels stood in the range of 511.74 mpcm to 840.68mpcm during the period. The standard limit for PM10 is 100 micrograms per cubic metre (mpcm) while that for PM2.5 is 60 mpcm. Likewise in Noida, the PM2.5 ranged from 223.09 mpcm to 585.17mpcm while the PM10 levels were between 394.49 mpcm and 920.95 mpcm. According to official figures of the CPCB, Delhi NCR this season had the worst PM10 levels as the concentration peaked to as high as 551.2 mpcm between November 5 to 6. The PM 2.5 concentration spiked to 424 mpcm . During the second spike in pollution levels, the PM10 concentrations have shot beyond the permissible limit of 500 mpcm and spiked to 574.1 mpcm while the PM2.5 concentration spiked to 372.2 mpcm. “There is spike in PM concentration levels and it is due to the unfavourable meteorological conditions, which also includes slow wind speed. The Ghaziabad/Noida region is still under ’severe’ category as the pollutants are trapped and will disperse only if the wind speed increases or if there is rainfall,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board. Experts said there is no likelihood of rain till November 19, which would help wash away the trapped pollutants. “The wind speed has marginally increased from 7kmph to 9kmph since Friday. On Saturday, the scenario was more or less to what it was on November 10 and 11. The visibility has also improved in the range of 1500-1800 metres, while it was about 500 meters on Friday. Overall, there is a marginal improvement but conditions will remain more or less same for the next couple of days,” said an officer from the Indian Meteorological Department. “The pollution levels are in the ‘severe’ category in most places in NCR. It is also due to the impact of stubble burning and accumulation of local pollutants. A depression over Odisha and Chattisgarh was present with easterly winds blocking the north-westerly winds. Since the depression has moved out, it is likely that the wind speed in NCR will pick up in the next two to three days and is expected to be in the range of 10-15kmph,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, meteorology and climate change, Skymet. “The rise in PM concentrations indicates the collective failure of agencies in mitigating the local sources of pollution, which is a contributing factor to the deteriorating air quality, besides external factors such as stubble burning and meteorological conditions,” said Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist. The forecast by System of air quality and weather forecasting and research (Safar) said on Saturday that the AQI is likely to improve for the next two days as winds at transport level (925 mb) are slowing down, resulting in lesser intrusion of pollutants from farm fires into Delhi. “However, as local winds are becoming calm and minimum temperature is decreasing further, preventing efficient dispersion of pollutants leading to improvement of air quality to upper end of very poor category or lower end of severe category,” said the Safar forecast. As a result of the deteriorating air quality and the prevailing weather conditions, residents staying in the flats on the higher floors of buildings are complaining of different complications. “I stay on the 10th floor and have to keep my doors and windows closed and also ensure my children are indoors. There is poor visibility in the morning. Hardly any measures are being taken at the ground level to control local sources of pollution,” said Sanjeev Sethi, a resident of Sector 107 in Noida. “I stay on the 18th floor. The high pollution levels have triggered burning sensation in my eyes and allergic reactions in the respiratory tract. There is a thick blanket of pollutants, which can be easily seen in the morning hours,” said Kamiya Arora, a resident of Crossings Republik Township. The sub-committee of the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM), after a meeting on November 12, directed the concerned states and implementing agencies to be ready to implement measures listed under the “emergency’ category of the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-most-polluted-for-second-day-in-a-row-no-respite-in-sight-101636829151930.html
14-11-2021||Noida||Mock drill at paediatric units in Gautam Budh Nagar to check Covid preparedness||A mock drill was carried out at the paediatric intensive care units (PICU) of government health centres on Saturday to check the preparedness of the facilities in the district for the anticipated third wave of Covid-19 that is said to affect children more than adults . The mock drills were carried out at five Covid-19 paediatric ICU facilities at Noida Covid Hospital (NCH) in Sector 39 and at the community health centres (CHC) at Bisrakh, Bhangel, Dadri and Jewar.“The drill was carried out keeping in mind the anticipated third wave of Covid-19 which may affect children,” said Dr Sunil Kumar Sharma, chief medical officer, Gautam Budh Nagar.Dr Sachin Vaish, joint director of medical health services, Uttar Pradesh, inspected the drill at NCH and the community centre at Bhagel. “In the last two mock drills, we have already checked the status of medical equipment, including oxygen supply and paediatric facilities, as well as training of medical staff. In today’s inspection, the focus was on fire safety in hospitals and power back up,” said Dr Vaish, who is the nodal officer deputed by the government to oversee the drills. In the light of fire accidents reported recently at hospitals in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, Dr Vaish said fire preparedness is an essential component that needs inspection. “We checked the fire extinguishers at NCH, that were in working condition, and also inspected the sprinklers. Apart from this, we also carried out a mock drill to see if all the oxygen plants at the hospital can run on the generator lest there is a blackout,” he said. Dr Yatendra Singh, medical superintendent of CHC Bhangel,said, “The nodal officer inspected all the arrangements for oxygen supply through concentrators in the paediatric ward. The high dependency unit (HDU) beds, especially the ones which have BiPap machines to provide oxygen, were also inspected. As paediatric patients always have their guardians or parents who stay over during their treatment, arrangements at the separate ward for attendants of patients were also checked.” According to official data, the district has total 440 beds reserved for paediatric care--- 10 each at the four CHCs and 100 each at Noida Covid Hospital, Government Institute Medical Science,s Postgraduate Institute of Child Health (Child PGI) and Sharda Hospital.Talking about medical staff, Dr Vaish admitted that Gautam Budh Nagar does not have sufficient paediatricians. “The district health department only has two paediatricians - one under the CMO and one under the chief medical superintendent of the district Hospital. However, we need at least 10 paediatricians. In a meeting with ACS health, we have requested that the state health department provide the district with the required number of medical experts,” said Dr Vaish.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/mock-drill-at-paediatric-units-in-gautam-budh-nagar-to-check-covid-preparedness-101636828850386.html

The board will not charge any exam fee from such students, said deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma on Saturday.The date of applying for advance registration for institutional and individual students of class 10 and 12 and students of class 9 and class 11 is until November 20.“For the convenience of all categories of students who have registered in the year 2021 examination, they will once again be given an opportunity to sit in board exam in 2022 without examination fee,” said Dinesh Sharma.In wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, the UP Board exam of 2021 was cancelled and students were allotted marks based on their previous academic performance. “The students of last year, who will appear in the 2022 board exam, will get an updated passing certificate-cum-mark sheet for the year 2021 only,” said Sharma.However, the candidates who passed the improvement examination held between September 18 and October 6, 2021, will not get the opportunity to reappear in the 2022 board examination, added Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-board-students-who-took-exam-in-21-can-apply-in-22-for-improvement-101636828613201.html
14-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi schools shut but CBSE board exams as per schedule||The Central Board of Secondary Education on Saturday said that the Term 1 board exams for Classes 10 and 12, slated to begin from Tuesday, will be held according to the schedule even as the Delhi government announced suspension of in-person classes for a week from Monday in view of the hazardous levels of air pollution in the national capital.The first of a two-part system of board examinations this year will be held in-person, starting Tuesday. There are over 2,100 CBSE-affiliated schools in Delhi. Sanyam Bhardwaj, controller of examinations of CBSE, said, “The closure directive is for other classes and not board exams. Board exams for classes 10 and 12 will take place as scheduled. There is no change.”Schools were shut in March last year when a nationwide lockdown was imposed to curb the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19). While in-person classes for students in grades 9-12 restarted in September, schools reopened for physical classes for students in all grades on November 1.School administrators said they will comply with the government’s order but raised concerns about the adverse impact on the learning gap that school closure might cause. “If the government has directed schools to suspend physical classes, we will have to comply with the orders. We are yet to receive the written order but have informed parents. Switching back to online classes will not be very difficult since online classes are already taking place in a hybrid manner,” said Sudha Acharya, the chairperson of the National Progressive Schools’ Conference which has over 120 top Delhi schools as its members.She said that the need of the hour was to find sustainable solutions since the closure of schools were not conducive. “Closure of schools over pollution is now becoming an annual affair. This is not sustainable. One cannot keep schools closed for three months starting from November. The impact of the learning gap created through school closures will heavily impact children in the long run. We must take steps to counter pollution,” she said.Tania Joshi, principal of The Indian School, said the school informed the parents, but was waiting for a written directive and clarity on board exams scheduled for next week. “We have a board exam on November 19. Now, we are waiting for instructions and clarity on how the exam will be conducted. Teachers will have to be in school for the mock exam as well. We will have to work out the logistics based on what the board tells us,” said Joshi.She said the school will have to rework its schedule in view of the closure of in-person classes. The school had planned children’s day celebrations on Monday which will now take place online. “There is a little disappointment among students now. There is uncertainty over the board practical exams as well that we had planned for next week. The only silver lining is that teaching will not be affected since we are used to online classes due to covid,” said Joshi.Jyoti Arora, principal of Mount Abu Public School in Rohini, said that the school will revert to its old timeline based on online classes once written orders from the department of education are issued. Arora said that most schools were in the process of conducting board practicals and will need to tweak the exam schedule once written orders are issued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-schools-shut-but-cbse-board-exams-as-per-schedule-101636827890579.html
14-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi pollution: Construction ban may delay key infra projects||Senior engineers and project managers overseeing key infrastructure projects such as the work on an underpass and extension of the flyover at Ashram and the revamp of Pragati Maidan said that the four-day ban on construction activities between November 14 and 17 announced by the Delhi government on Saturday in view of the hazardous levels of air pollution in the city is likely to delay work, leading to missed deadlines.The Public Works Department is currently working on several projects such as Pragati Maidan integrated transit corridor development, Ashram underpass, Benito Juarez Road-San Martin Road underpass, the streetscaping of eleven arterial stretches and others. The Pragati Maidan and Ashram underpass projects are in advanced stages with more than 95% work being completed.A senior PWD official who asked not to be named said that some of these projects are specifically aimed at decongesting arterial stretches and thereby cutting vehicular emissions, adding that the government should grant exemption to such projects.Hours after the Supreme Court ordered the Centre and Delhi government to take “emergent measures” to curb dangerous air pollution levels in the national Capital, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday announced several measures such as shutting of schools for in-person classes for a week, banning construction between November 14 and 17, and work for home for government employees for a week from Monday.Officials associated with infrastructure projects said that monsoon has already led to delays, and the current ban may further hit objectives to meet deadline. “In 2019-2020, the construction ban continued for several months and then it was followed by the national lockdown which led to complete derailment of many projects aimed at decongesting the city. We are planning to deploy the existing labour in cleaning and dust control measures so that we don’t face labour shortage once the ban is lifted,” a senior PWD official said.The municipal corporations that are also working on road improvement projects across the city said the ban will hit work progress, but it was necessary at the moment. East Delhi Municipal Corporation Mayor Shyam Sunder Aggarwal said projects such as Shahdara lake revamp, Karkardooma zonal headquarters, road and school development projects will be impacted. “Unlike previous construction bans, the Delhi government should ensure that food and sustenance for labourers and their families is ensured. Most of these households are on hand to mouth basis and daily earnings. We do not have enough financial resources to take care of them but some relief should be provided,” Aggarwal said.A 2018 study conducted by The Energy and Resources Institute (Teri), a Delhi-based research institute, showed that vehicle emissions account for 24%-28% of the city’s pollution. Dust, on the other hand, contributed only 18%-38% to the city’s overall pollution.A senior municipal official from the north corporation said, “Many projects were delayed due to heavy monsoon rain this year, and an extended ban can further derail them. We can take care of workers for a week but if the ban runs for an extended period, we will have to relieve some of them. It is government’s order and we cannot do much in this regard,” the official said, adding that the situation will be reviewed on November 18.According to the Supreme Court mandated Graded Response Action Plan (Grap), a ban on construction activities has to be implemented if the air quality index -- on a scale of 0 to 500 -- touches ‘‘severe plus (500+)’ or emergency category.The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), which has been working on three corridors of its Phase 4 expansion plans, said it will follow the government directions. Anuj Dayal, executive director, corporate communication DMRC said, “The DMRC will follow the government instructions . We are awaiting the detailed directions. Accordingly, necessary actions will be taken to ensure compliance. It is too early to assess what impact it will have on the progress of construction work.”Dr. S Velmurugan, chief scientist, Central Road Research Institute (CRRI), said the agencies should not leave the sites unattended. “The agencies should not leave the open construction sites unattended in places such as Ashram underpass or Central Vista project. A section labourers should be used to sprinkle water at the sites and in implementing anti-dust measures,” he said.He added that if the government decides to further extend the ban, it may consider exempting a few projects that will prove critical in decongesting major stretches, albeit with stringent dust control measures.Delhi’s recorded its worst air quality on Friday with the city recording an AQI of 471, the worst recorded so far this year. On Saturday, it improved a bit to reach 437.Public health experts have warned that even short-term exposure to such high pollution levels may cause damage to several key organs such as lungs, heart and brain, even among healthy individuals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-pollution-construction-ban-may-delay-key-infra-projects-101636827830429.html
14-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi air pollution: SC slams Delhi govt, Centre; orders emergent measures||The Supreme Court on Saturday urged the Centre and the Delhi government to take “emergent measures”, including imposition of a lockdown in the national capital, to “immediately” control rising levels of air pollution as it also lamented that “bashing farmers” over stubble burning has become a fashion even though there are several other major contributors to the hazardous air quality.“We don’t want lengthy arguments or hearing but everyone can see how bad the situation is. Even inside houses, we are forced to wear masks. The situation is very serious...We have a burning situation. How do we control this? Tell us what are the immediate steps that can be taken,” a bench, headed by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana asked solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who appeared for the Union government.While seeking a report on the countermeasures on Monday, the bench, which also included justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and Surya Kant, also questioned the Delhi government over the steps they have taken to keep the children out of harm’s way when the schools have also opened.“Look at problem. Schools have opened as the pandemic has subsided. At 7 in the morning, little children are on the streets, exposing themselves to this kind of pollution. We are witnessing children’s lungs getting exposed to such bad quality of air. And this has nothing to do with the central government. Has Delhi government responded to the situation? Have you said anything to the schools? What have you done?” the court asked senior counsel Rahul Mehra, who represented the city government.Both the S-G and Mehra sought to point out that crop residue burning in the states adjoining Delhi is one of the chief contributors of the worsening air quality in the national capital region (NCR) in the pre-winter weeks but the bench dismissed their suggestion outrightly.“You are projecting as if farmers are responsible for everything. The stubble burning could be responsible for 30% of pollution but where is the effective mechanism to control firecrackers, vehicular pollution, dust and industrial pollution?” the court asked Mehta, who clarified repeatedly that the Centre is not blaming farmers in any manner but is enumerating various issues that have led to the present situation.As S-G added that the court’s remarks on Centre blaming farmers may pose difficulties, the bench replied: “For the sake of clarity, we want to say that we have nothing to do with governments or any political party. We will say that you said there are various reasons for this pollution...Everyone has to look at this issue beyond politics or government. It affects everyone. Take immediate urgent measures. Impose two days lockdown, if required. How will people live otherwise?”When Delhi government’s counsel Mehra submitted that it is “probably” the stubble burning that has made the air quality index and PM10 and PM2.5 pollutants shoot up by several hundred points, the bench retorted: “What is this? Now, it has become a fashion to bash farmers, whether its Delhi government or someone else. You had imposed a ban on firecrackers in Delhi. But see what has been happening in the last 7-8 days. What are you doing? What are Delhi Police doing?”Addressing the S-G and Mehra, the bench added: “It is an emergency situation and emergent measures are required. Various emergent measures are to be taken. This is not a time to conduct research on stubble burning etc. Why don’t you consider stopping vehicles? Sit with the Central government and see how you can bring down the pollution levels down in the next two or three days. Take some short-term urgent measures. First control Delhi which is in a very bad situation. Then we can look at some other states.”Air pollution reached the season’s worst levels on Friday as the toxic smog that has persisted for over a week thickened and emissions breached “emergency” level thresholds that would have normally led to a host of curbs like a ban on construction work, the entry of heavy vehicles, and odd-even car use limits. This year has also seen the number of farm fires reaching a new high for this late in November with the enforcement of a ban on the practice collapsing.Between November 1 and November 13 this year, Punjab and Haryana have recorded the most number of stubble fires since 2012, satellite data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) shows. According to the data accessed by HT from SUOMI VIIRS C2, FIRMS-NASA resource, between November 1 and November 13, the cumulative fire count reported from the two states was 57,263, exceeding 52,719 incidents recorded in 2016.Meanwhile, the S-G told the bench that the Union government is convening a meeting with representatives of state governments of Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan on Saturday afternoon, and all the suggestions mooted by the court shall be considered during the deliberation. Mehta added that a report will be presented before the court on Monday when the case is heard next.The bench was hearing a public interest litigation filed by a 17-year-old Delhi student, Aditya Dubey, who has alleged that authorities have failed to protect his fundamental right to clean air and health by not controlling air pollution in the NCR.During the proceedings, the S-G referred to the measures taken by various authorities, including the commission for air quality management in NCR, to control stubble burning and added that there has been a spurt in farm fires in Punjab in the last 5-6 days which the state needs to control. Mehta also mentioned about the use of crop residue as a biomass in power plants and availability of 200,000 machines to manage stubble.To this, the bench asked Mehta to give out details of where these machines are and how they are being used. It added: “The problem with the farmers is with incentivisation. Why will a farmer do this (burn crop residue) if he has avenues of being incentivised? You talked about machines. Can you tell us how may cooperative societies have been set up? How many machines are supplied? What’s the cost? What is the arrangement put in place to ensure stubble is transported from the farms? What is the economic arrangement? The problem is with the fine prints.”Justice Surya Kant, at this point, underscored that the average land holding in states like Haryana and UP is less than 3 acres. “You cannot expect these farmers to purchase such machines. Why can’t Central government lift the stubble and take it to various points? I am a farmer. Honourable CJI is a farmer. We belong to these states. We know the issues.”The court further asked Mehta: “This was a year of late monsoon. Farmers had a smaller number of days to clear their fields. Farmers were in an anxiety to sow kharif crops to take the benefit of the ensuing winter. Did you take any steps in the window of that 15 days to reach out to the farmers and take out stubble? It is good that the commission now has a policy but the problem is how are you implementing it. How did you ensure the stubble is actually removed and taken to the plants and (that) farmers have some economic benefits in this process? Give us some sample figures for some sample districts.”Mehta replied that he would need a couple of days to revert with all the specific queries of the bench, requesting that the case could be taken up on Monday.The bench accepted Mehta’s suggestions. It, however, added: “Impose some strict measures. Improve the situation in next two or three days. Why don’t you ask Punjab and Haryana to stop stubble burning completely for the next three days. Let the levels come down. It is a problem for all. We will adjourn it to Monday. In the meantime, you take some immediate steps. The ultimate point is that pollution levels should come down.”Hours later, the Delhi government announced a ban on construction activities between November 14 and 17, ordered schools to close in-person classes for a week and asked government office staff to work from home for a week.“This concerns our life, and health. We are being forced to take these tough measures, I hope the residents of Delhi will understand, and cooperate with us,” Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said while announcing the measures after chairing an emergency meeting on the unprecedented spike in air pollution.About the Supreme Court’s suggestion to impose two-day lockdown, Kejriwal said no decision was taken on it, but the government will prepare a detailed proposal and put it before the apex court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-air-pollution-sc-slams-delhi-centre-orders-emergent-measures-101636827411755.html
14-11-2021||Delhi||Customs arrest 2 women from Uganda with 12.9kg heroin||Two Ugandan women have been arrested at the Indira Gandhi International (IGI) airport with 12.9 kg of heroine, worth around ₹90 crores in the International market, customs officials said on Saturday.The women, who arrived in Delhi from Nairobi (Kenya) via Abu Dhabi, had concealed the seized narcotic substance in false bottom cavities of their check-in luggage, through which they were able to safely get past security at other airports.The incident occurred between Friday night and the early hours of Saturday, with one of the two women first taken in for a physical check and inspection, following an earlier tip-off. The use of canines from the dog squad was made while carrying out a physical check, with the dogs indicating the presence of a possible narcotic substance, officials said.“We then carried out a detailed baggage search and questioned the first woman, who admitted to have heroine in her check-in baggage. Upon inspecting the bag, it was found to be ingeniously concealed in a specially-made cavity underneath the fibre-plastic base of her suitcase. Around 5.4 kgs had been vacuum-packed in plastic and paper bags,” a senior customs official said, on condition of anonymity.Officials said the second woman passenger, who exited the flight much later, was apprehended shortly after and was found to be carrying 7.5 kgs of heroin in a similarly designed cavity in her suitcase.“The women said they had been offered money by a Kenyan national to bring certain goods to Delhi. They were handed over the drugs in Nairobi, along with the flight tickets and certain documents to cover their visit as medical tourists. They were to hand over the heroin soon after exiting the airport,” the official said, stating the two women will be probed further.The customs had earlier seized around three kgs of heroin from a Kenyan national on October 29, who too had come to Delhi from Nairobi. Just prior to that, 2 kgs of heroin had been seized from two Indian nationals coming from Uganda. So far this year, over 100 kg of heroin has been seized and 26 people arrested by customs at the Delhi airport.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/two-ugandan-nationals-held-iwth-12-9kg-heroin-at-delhi-s-igi-airport-101636827110904.html

But our department is also looking if others were involved in this,” said Wales Patil during a press conference in Mumbai.The march turned violent in Nanded, Malegaon and Amravati with mob pelting stones on shops in which two policemen were also injured in the incident. In Nanded, stones were pelted at police vans and two police personnel sustained injuries at Deglur Naka and Shivaji Nagar. Protestors were also seen torching shops and police vehicles in Malegaon and Amravati, following which the riot squad was called in to quell the protests.In response to the violent march, BJP called Amravati bandh on Saturday which also turned violent with stones pelted at various shops as a large mob gathered at Rajkamal chowk and some old parts of the city.Shiv Sena spokesperson Sanjay Raut termed Raza Academy as BJP promoted outfit. “We know what Raza Academy is. For years, it has been working to help BJP,” said Raut in Aurangabad.The BJP state unit chief Chandrakant Patil refuted allegations saying Shiv Sena should focus on maintaining law and order rather than making political comments.Raza Academy denounced the violence at rallies. “Today the bandh call given in Mumbai and parts of Maharashtra to protest against blasphemous utterances against the holy Prophet was very successful. But some people from Malegaon are indulging in disturbing the peace of the area. I request that Muslims will not indulge in rioting in the name of the Prophet and refrain from violent and illegal acts. The Muslim community must go back home and ensure that peace is maintained. Malegaon has a good image and Muslims must protect their image by spreading peace and harmony,” said Saeed Noorie, general secretary of Raza Academy, in a video message released on Twitter.A group of like-minded Sunni Muslims, under the leadership of founder president Saeed Noori, established Raza Academy in 1978 at Null Bazar in south Mumbai to print and publish books written by 17th-century Muslim scholar Aalahazrat Imam Ahmed Raza.Academy’s reputation suffered a setback in 2012 after violence left two people dead and some policemen injured during a protest March in Mumbai.In over five decades, the academy set up more than 30 centres across India and became a voice of the country’s Sunni community. While the academy has participated in multiple protest marches in the past, most of them were largely peaceful with black flags, badges, banners and ribbons have been characteristic of it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/raza-academy-in-focus-as-protest-rallies-turn-violent-in-amravati-nanded-malegaon-101636821050116.html

Hence, we have decided to make zika containment zones similar to Covid-19 and have constituted around 500 surveillance teams, and allocated eight hospitals for the treatment of zika patients,” said Abhishek Prakash, district magistrate in the meeting.The surveillance teams would comprise members of ASHA, Aganwadi and Civil defence community. There are 19 community healthcare centres (CHCs) in the district. There would be 25 teams on every CHC.At present, there are three Zika cases in Lucknow, of which one is admitted to a hospital.“Containment zone has been successful in checking spread of Covid infection as it restricts movement of infected persons, who can spread infection to others. It will certainly help control spread of the Zika too,” said Dr Abhishek Shukla, secretary general of Association of International Doctors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/containment-zones-to-be-created-in-zika-affected-areas-of-lucknow-101636820209796.html
14-11-2021||Mumbai||After fresh violence, curfew imposed, internet suspended in Amravati||The district administration in Amravati imposed an indefinite curfew and suspended the internet services after at least 15 people, including three police personnel, were left injured on Saturday, following a protest. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had called for a bandh against the violent clashes that had occurred during another protest which was called by some Muslim organisations on Friday over reports of a mosque in Tripura being vandalised. Tension prevailed in many parts of the area since Saturday morning after some unidentified persons pelted stones at shops during the protest. Violence broke out in Cotton Market, Raj Kamal Chowk, Rajapeth, Namuna and Jawahar Gate areas when a massive morcha (march) was taken out by BJP workers. Police have imposed section 144 in the city, prohibiting people from gathering at a place. Amravati’s acting commissioner of police Sandip Patil said that essential services would be exempted during the curfew. Patil was prompted to announce the indefinite curfew after a fresh spell of violence rocked the city on Saturday afternoon when several shops were set afire in Rajapeth and Namuna areas and crowds damaged public and private properties. At least four battalions of the State Reserve Police Force were deployed to maintain law and order in the city. Commissioner of police Aarati Singh, who was on a long leave, is returning on duty due to the incident. The situation turned volatile after massive crowds, shouting slogans and carrying banners and saffron flags surged onto the roads. Shortly later, some sections resorted to stone pelting at private and government vehicles, shops and establishments, forcing the police to resort to mild caning and tear gas shells to disperse the crowd and control the situation. Former Maharashtra minister and senior BJP leader Dr Anil Bonde, who was leading the march, said, “It was a completely peaceful march and the police deliberately resorted to lathi charge. At least 20 party workers were injured in the police lathi charge.” Senior police officer Shashikant Satav said the situation is tense but under control. Amravati district guardian minister Yashomati Thakur, who is camping in the district, said the incident was “unfortunate”. “Everyone has the right to protest. But violence in the name of protest is not right. We appeal to people to maintain peace. Some malicious elements are working to spread violence in the city and the police are working to maintain law and order,” she said. Meanwhile, leader of the Opposition and senior BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis urged the state government to ensure law and order in Amravati and condemned Friday’s violence in Pusad, Amravati and Nanded. Shiv Sena leader and state Agriculture Mission chairman Kishore Tiwari has slammed BJP for organising the counter-march in Amravati on Saturday. “BJP is resorting to such communal tactics to polarise voters, with an eye on next year’s civic elections in Maharashtra as well as the 2022 elections in some states, including Uttar Pradesh,” alleged Tiwari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/after-fresh-violence-curfew-imposed-internet-suspended-in-amravati-101636820089893.html

Two critically injured passengers, identified as Khaleeda and Ashu, were referred to Government Medical College, Jammu, where the latter died after sometime. The police officer said that the Tata Sumo was ferrying vendors, mostly from Uttar Pradesh, when it plunged into a deep gorge. The vehicle was being driven negligently and that led to the accident, he added. Eleven injured have been hospitalised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ramban-road-accident-3-dead-11-injured-as-suv-plunges-into-gorge-101636808269473.html

The Lockheed Martin F-35 entered into service in 2015 with the U.S. Marine Corps.Yury Slusar, head of United Aircraft Corp, part of Russia's state aerospace and defence conglomerate, Rostec, said there had been "intensive contacts" with the Russian air force.Western diplomats doubt US-allied Gulf states would buy sophisticated equipment like the Checkmate, though sales of Russian hardware to the Gulf have increased in recent years.The UAE in 2017 signed a preliminary deal to buy Sukhoi Su-35 warplanes and jointly work with Russia on a next generation fighter but so far it appears not to have made progress."The UAE likes the idea of cultivating ties with the Russian defence industry but it's mainly a way to send a message to the U.S.," said Jean-Loup Samaan, senior research fellow with the Middle East Institute at the National University of Singapore.Washington's sale of 50 F-35 Lighting II warplanes to the UAE has slowed amid concerns about the UAE's relationship with China, including the prevalence of Huawei 5G technology in the country.The US agreed to sell the plane after the UAE last year established ties with Israel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-uae-waits-for-us-f-35s-russia-pitches-new-warplane-in-dubai-101636911142775.html

14-11-2021||World||Stark warning for Democrats as Biden's approval rating hits new low: Report||The approval rating of US President Joe Biden has hit a new low as the majority of Americans disapprove of the way he has handled the economy, according to a new poll. Biden took the office in January this year as the United States was struggling to contain the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and to revive the economy hit by the pandemic. He successfully pushed for a $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure package but that hasn't helped his overall approval rating.According to a Washington Post-ABC News poll conducted telephonically last week, 53% of the respondents disapproved of the way Biden has handled his job as the US president. While the majority of Americans support the federal government’s move to spend about two trillion dollars on addressing climate action and to create or expand preschool, health care and other social programs, 55% of the respondents don’t approve of Biden’s handling of the economy.Biden’s approval rating on his handling of the pandemic is also not encouraging. About 49% of respondents voted in disapproval and 47% approved the way the US president is handling the pandemic.Despite a low approval rating, the Democrat has performed better than his predecessor on the poll conducted after 10 months in office. While 63% of respondents believe Biden has achieved not much, little or nothing after being 10 months in office, 65% of respondents had a similar opinion about Trump after a similar period in 2017.A whopping 70% of the respondents either said the nation’s economy is “not so good” or is in “poor” condition.“Overall, the survey offers a set of harsh judgments about the president’s performance and the state of the economy. Together, they send a stark warning to Democrats about their prospects in the 2022 midterm contests,” The Post said in its report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/stark-warning-for-democrats-as-biden-s-approval-rating-hits-new-low-report-101636907127037.html

14-11-2021||World||This European nation is imposing lockdown for people not fully vaccinated against Covid||Austria is placing millions of people not fully vaccinated against the coronavirus in lockdown as of Monday to deal with a surge in infections to record levels and the growing strain on intensive-care units, the government said on Sunday.Europe is the epicentre of the Covid-19 pandemic again, prompting some governments to consider re-imposing unpopular lockdowns. Austria has one of the continent's highest infection rates, with a seven-day incidence of 815 per 100,000 people."We are not taking this step lightly but it is necessary," Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg told a news conference announcing the new measure, under which the unvaccinated can only leave their homes for a limited number of reasons like going to work or shopping for essentials.Roughly 65% of Austria's population is fully vaccinated against Covid-19, one of the lowest rates in western Europe. Many Austrians are sceptical about vaccines, a view encouraged by the far-right Freedom Party, the third biggest in parliament.The measures on Monday will extend those brought in a week ago which banned the unvaccinated from places including restaurants, hotels, theatres and ski lifts.While the Netherlands is dealing with its surge in cases by imposing a partial lockdown that applies to all, Austria's conservative-led government wants to avoid imposing further restrictions on those who are fully vaccinated."In reality we have told one third of the population: you will not leave your apartment anymore apart from for certain reasons. That is a massive reduction in contacts between the vaccinated and the unvaccinated," Schallenberg said.In Germany, the federal government and leaders of Germany's 16 states are due to meet next week to discuss tightening measures. Germany has already classified Austria as a high-risk area, meaning people arriving from there have to go into quarantine, a blow to Austria's winter tourism industry.Targeted measures have recently been introduced in Australia, where 83% of people aged 16 and above have been fully inoculated. Some states have mandated vaccinations for some occupations and barred the unvaccinated from activities such as dining out, leading to demonstrations.Singapore, where 85% of the population has been fully vaccinated, has said those who remained unvaccinated by choice would have to foot their medical bills from next month.Austria's lockdown, which does not apply to the under-12s or people who have recently recovered from Covid-19, will initially last 10 days, Health Minister Wolfgang Mueckstein said.Many officials, including within Schallenberg's conservative party and the police, have expressed doubts this lockdown can be properly enforced as it applies to only part of the population.

Austria has one of the continent's highest infection rates, with a seven-day incidence of 815 per 100,000 people.Austria is the first European country to reinstate the same restrictions on daily movements that applied during national lockdowns before vaccines were rolled out, though this time they only affect a minority of the population."We are not taking this step lightly but it is necessary," Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg told a news conference announcing the new measure, under which the unvaccinated can only leave their homes for a limited number of reasons like going to work or shopping for essentials.Roughly 65% of Austria's population is fully vaccinated against Covid-19, one of the lowest rates in western Europe. Many Austrians are sceptical about vaccines, a view encouraged by the far-right Freedom Party, the third biggest in parliament.The measures on Monday will extend those brought in a week ago which banned the unvaccinated from places including restaurants, hotels, theatres and ski lifts.While the Netherlands is dealing with its surge in cases by imposing a partial lockdown that applies to all, Austria's conservative-led government wants to avoid imposing further restrictions on those who are fully vaccinated."In reality we have told one third of the population: you will not leave your apartment anymore apart from for certain reasons. That is a massive reduction in contacts between the vaccinated and the unvaccinated," Schallenberg said.In Germany, the federal government and leaders of Germany's 16 states are due to meet next week to discuss tightening measures. Germany has already classified Austria as a high-risk area, meaning people arriving from there have to go into quarantine, a blow to Austria's winter tourism industry.Targeted measures have recently been introduced in Australia, where 83% of people aged 16 and above have been fully inoculated. Some states have mandated vaccinations for some occupations and barred the unvaccinated from activities such as dining out, leading to demonstrations.Singapore, where 85% of the population has been fully vaccinated, has said those who remained unvaccinated by choice would have to foot their medical bills from next month.Austria's lockdown, which does not apply to the under-12s or people who have recently recovered from Covid-19, will initially last 10 days, health minister Wolfgang Mueckstein said.Police checks, stiff finesMany officials, including within Schallenberg's conservative party and the police, have expressed doubts this lockdown can be properly enforced as it applies to only part of the population.Interior Minister Karl Nehammer said there will be thorough police checks and fines of up to 1,450 euros ($1,660) for breaches, and all interactions with the police will include checking people's vaccination status."As of tomorrow, every citizen, every person who lives in Austria must be aware that they can be checked by the police," Nehammer told the news conference.Showing an official Covid pass proving that you have been vaccinated, recovered from Covid-19 or recently tested has been required for months in various places including restaurants, theatres, cafes and hairdressers.Such passes continue to be required in those places; as of last week the unvaccinated are longer allowed in. As of Monday non-essential shops, where no such passes are required, will be off-limits to the unvaccinated, but the only checks will be spot checks by the police, Nehammer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/austria-orders-millions-of-non-vaccinated-people-into-covid-19-lockdown-101636890667025.html

She is also believed to have given up drinking alcohol.At a public event in Brixton, south London, on Thursday, her eldest son and heir was asked by one onlooker: "Prince Charles, how is your mother?""She's alright," he replied.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uks-queen-elizabeth-ii-to-miss-remembrance-service-for-sprained-back-palace-101636887589938.html

US President Joe Biden has received sharp criticism from critics for his administration’s lack of preparedness for these refugees, who are spread across eight military bases in the country.A report by HuffPost said that the military base in Fort McCoy, Wisconsin houses the majority of the Afghan refugees with as many as 13,000 of them living there. The Pentagon has said 44 per cent of the nearly 50,00 refugees living at the bases are children as of October.Also Read | No more US boots on ground in AfghanistanThe HuffPost report further stated that some refugees have mentioned about not having sufficient winter robes even as temperatures have dipped.Volunteers and refugee settlement groups have also complained of being overwhelmed with the number of refugees, understaffed and the lack of plan by the Biden administration to help the Afghans transition into a life in the US.“There was never a plan because it was so chaotic from the beginning and there are so many unknowns,” Spojmie Ahmady Nasiri, a California-based immigration attorney, who has visited five of the eight military bases, told HuffPost.Also Read | ‘What’s your plan to ensure Taliban don’t acquire nuclear weapons from Pak?’: US lawmakers to BidenBiden has been under the knife due to the manner in which the pullout of US troops and evacuations of Afghans took place after the Taliban recaptured Afghanistan on August 15. The scenes at Kabul airport were nothing short of a mayhem with people standing in long queues starting early morning with documents in hand only to stand a chance to be flown out of the country and the grips of the Sunni Pashtun group.Despite pressure from US allies to extend the deadline for the pullout of the troops, Biden stuck to August 31 – only days after the Taliban talked of retaliation over an extension of the date.Khaama Press reported that critics have criticised the Biden administration for leaving behind tens of thousands of Afghans, who worked for the US in their 20-year-long war, and instead bringing unknown persons to the US.In October, Fox News had reported that an inspector general-ranked officer in the US state department will investigate the immigrant visa program and the clearing of Afghans for entry into the country as refugees. The report stated that the officer would also probe the evacuation of the US embassy in Kabul.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-refugees-at-us-military-base-struggle-from-scanty-winter-supplies-report-101636886249930.html
14-11-2021||World||US military hid airstrikes that killed dozens of civilians in Syria: Report||The US military covered up 2019 airstrikes in Syria that killed up to 64 women and children, a possible war crime, during the battle against Islamic State, the New York Times reported on Saturday.The two back-to-back airstrikes near the town of Baghuz were ordered by a classified American special operations unit tasked with ground operations in Syria, according to the report.The newspaper said that US Central Command, which oversaw US air operations in Syria, acknowledged the strikes for the first time this week and said they were justified.In a statement on Saturday, Central Command reiterated the account it gave the newspaper that 80 people were killed in the strikes including 16 Islamic State fighters and four civilians. The military said it was unclear if the other 60 people were civilians, partly because women and children could have been combatants.In Saturday's statement, the military said the strikes were "legitimate self-defense," proportional and that "appropriate steps were taken to rule out the presence of civilians.""We abhor the loss of innocent life and take all possible measures to prevent them. In this case, we self-reported and investigated the strike according to our own evidence and take full responsibility for the unintended loss of life," Central Command said.The number of civilians among the 60 fatalities could not be determined because "multiple armed women and at least one armed child were observed" in video of the events, it said, adding that the majority of the 60 were likely combatants.Central Command said the strikes took place while Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) were under heavy fire and in danger of being overrun and the SDF had reported the area clear of civilians.The Defense Department's inspector general launched an inquiry into the March 18, 2019, incident, but its report was ultimately "stripped" of any mention of the bombing and a thorough, independent probe never took place, according to the Times. The newspaper said its report was based on confidential documents and descriptions of classified reports, as well as interviews with personnel directly involved.An Air Force lawyer present in the operations center at the time believed the strikes were possible war crimes and later alerted the Defense Department's inspector general and the Senate Armed Services Committee when no action was taken, the Times said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-military-hid-airstrikes-that-killed-dozens-of-civilians-in-syria-report-101636880570730.html

It has hindered efforts to boost state finances - hit hard last year by low oil prices and the pandemic - and enact a debt law needed to tap global markets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kuwait-emir-accepts-govt-resignation-in-a-bid-to-end-feud-with-lawmakers-report-101636885295740.html

Gen Anjum is presently Karachi Corps Commander and Gen Hameed has been posted as Peshawar Corps Commander.Even as the big two in Pakistan are at loggerheads, PM Khan’s political space appears to be shrinking due to poor economy due to high debt and inflation, and the Supreme Court Chief Justice Gulzar Ahmed hauling him over coals for seeking a peace deal with Tehreek-e-Taliban, Pakistan (TTP) terrorist group with the help of Sirajuddin Haqqani, head of the eponymous terrorist network. That the Pakistan regime virtually surrendered to the demands of marchers of Barelvi Tehreek-e-Labbaik (TLP) by lifting the ban on the extremist group and releasing its jailed leaders earlier this month has seriously added to PM Khan’s political discomfort.According to Islamabad watchers, Pakistan is currently on tenterhooks with all the major generals in the ISI already reporting to Lt Gen Nadeem Anjum, who is already in Rawalpindi to take over from Lt Gen Hameed. “There is political flux in Islamabad with rumours flying all over the place speculating outcomes of the fight between Khan and Bajwa in the run-up to the new DG ISI. There are even unverified reports that the 111 Rawalpindi brigade is also on the standby to tackle the worst-case scenario,” said an expert. There are reports that coalition partners of the Tehreek-e-Insaaf government like MQM and PML-Q are looking for other political options.One of the key reasons behind the removal of Lt Gen Hameed by Gen Bajwa was due to the former’s proximity to the Taliban regime in Kabul, particularly the Sirajuddin Haqqani group. While PM Khan wanted Afghanistan to add to Pakistan strategic space against India, Gen Bajwa apparently believes that the toxic ideology of the Taliban would ultimately harm his country. The Pakistan army chief is against radical extremism from Afghanistan spilling over across the Durand Line.While Pakistan polity is no stranger to constant political conspiracies and intrigue between the Army and the civilian leadership since 1947, the coming week may define whether PM Khan or Gen Bajwa comes on top.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-gen-bajwa-tension-simmers-in-pak-before-new-dg-isi-appointment-101636867622476.html

He also called upon member nations to phase out the usage of coal and protect vulnerable communities from the impacts of climate change.“The outcome of COP26 is a compromise. It reflects the interests, the contradictions and the state of political will in the world today. It is an important step, but it is not enough.

It makes no sense to give boosters to healthy adults, or to vaccinate children, when health workers, older people, and other high-risk groups around the world are still awaiting their first dose,” he remarked, though he also said that as an exception, only immunocompromised people should be administered booster doses, as previously suggested by the global health body in October.Also Read | WHO experts suggest booster Covid-19 vaccine shot for immunocompromisedGhebreyesus further alleged that some countries were ‘stockpiling’ vaccines. “Nations with the highest vaccine coverage continue to stockpile more vaccines, while low-income countries continue to wait,” he said.Also Read | In France, people above 65 yrs will need booster jab for Covid-19 passAll of this is a ‘scandal’ that must be stopped now, he added.The WHO director-general's remarks come at a time when several countries are already administering booster doses to at least a section of their respective eligible population due to a fresh surge in Covid-19 cases, or due to an expected surge.

14-11-2021||World||‘Blah, blah, blah’: Greta Thunberg's assessment of COP26 climate agreement||Environmental campaigner Greta Thunberg has dismissed a global agreement reached at the United Nations-hosted climate talks in Scotland’s Glasgow as “blah, blah, blah”.At the end of the COP26 climate summit, as nations called for a “phase down” of coal power that critics describe as a “compromise” in way of attempts to cut down on fossil fuel, Thunberg said the real work continued outside these halls and activists like her would never give up.Also Read | 'It is not a secret': Climate activist Greta Thunberg labels COP26 ‘failure’Taking to her official handle on Twitter, Thunberg wrote, “The #COP26 is over. Here's a brief summary: Blah, blah, blah. But the real work continues outside these halls. And we will never give up, ever.”The #COP26 is over. Here’s a brief summary: Blah, blah, blah.But the real work continues outside these halls. And we will never give up, ever. https://t.co/EOne9OogiRThe youth campaigner also retweeted an earlier post of hers, where she had indicated that such ‘compromises’ in the way of climate action are equivalent to losing. “Unless we achieve immediate, drastic, unprecedented, annual emission cuts at the source then that means we're failing when it comes to this climate crisis,” she had written, adding “small steps in the right direction, “making some progress” or “winning slowly” equals losing”.The climate talks in Scotland are, however, being lauded for keeping alive hopes of capping global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius and maintaining a realistic shot at saving the world from catastrophic climate change.Although the two-week conference in Glasgow was the 26th of its kind, it was the first to call for a reduction in fossil fuels that not only power much of the world's economy but are also the main causes of manmade global warming.WATCH | Greta Thunberg's verdict after COP26 Glasgow summit to address climate changeHowever, there was some last-minute drama as India, backed by China and a few other coal-dependent developing nations, raised objections to this part of the agreement and asked for the wording to be rewritten. The clause was hurriedly amended to ask countries to accelerate their efforts towards a coal power “phase down” instead of “phase out”.This, Union environment and climate minister Bhupender Yadav later told Reuters, was done to reflect the “national circumstances of emerging economies”. He also expressed his apprehension over the fact that coal had been “singled out” during the COP26 talks, while there was no similar call to phase out oil or natural gas, even though rich, developed nations have historically emitted the largest share of greenhouse gases.Thunberg and other activists had earlier denounced the conference for the way it was playing out, arguing that world leaders had failed to match their words with real action. Thunberg said that pledges from some nations made during COP26 to accelerate their emissions cuts amounted to little more than “a two-week-long celebration of business as usual” and “blah, blah, blah”. (With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/blah-blah-blah-greta-thunberg-s-assessment-of-cop26-climate-agreement-101636846931176.html
14-11-2021||World||Tense final hours at COP26 amid tough stands on deal||Consensus eluded the 196 parties at the Glasgow climate change conference (COP26) on Saturday after developed and developing nations remained deeply divided over the third Cover Decision Text released by the COP26 presidency, with India being one of those that maintained a tough stand on the issue.While the deliberations appeared to be tentatively heading for a deal that conference host Britain said would keep alive a goal of capping global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius to maintain a realistic chance of avoiding catastrophe, tensions spilled into the open as the talks came down to the wire.China and India, the world’s first- and third-biggest emitters, put up a tough stance to the most ambitious parts of the final agreement in Glasgow. India objected to the point of asking countries to shift away from fossil fuels. The two nations flagged that the draft text lacked balance, differentiation, and equity.The red lines were on the issues of compensating loss and damage, mobilising climate mitigation and adaptation finance by developed countries for developing nations. Late on Saturday, many nations said that in the spirit of compromise, they may endorse the third draft text even if they did not agree with most aspects of the draft.COP26 was to close on Friday evening but negotiations stretched overnight, with deep divergences that couldn’t be resolved even as COP26 president Alok Sharma insisted “parties have different priorities, but we have to sign up to the same view. We have reached a comprehensive, balanced outcome. The text is now clear of brackets and is a result of a transparent, party driven process”.Following the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report in August flagging that 1.5 degrees Celsius global warming threshold is likely to be breached in the next 10 to 20 years, COP26 was being seen as the last chance to keep the 1.5 degrees C goal in reach through an ambitious and equitable agreement in Glasgow. But on Saturday, even after two weeks of negotiations and very ambitious pledges by world leaders during the Leaders’ Summit on November 1 and 2, very serious concerns and differences remained.Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav, head of the Indian delegation, made an intervention on inequitable aspects of the draft text. “Consensus has remained elusive. Climate friendly lifestyles and climate justice is enshrined in the Paris Agreement are key to solving the climate crisis. The crisis is caused by unsustainable lifestyles and wasteful consumption patterns. The world needs to awaken to this reality,” he said, adding that “fossil fuels and their use has enabled parts of the world to attain high levels of wealth and wellbeing… when we have taken economy wide targets, targeting any particular sector is uncalled for”.“Every country will arrive at net zero as per its own national circumstances. Developing countries have a right to the fair share of the global carbon budget and are entitled to responsible use of fossil fuels in such scope. In such a situation how can one expect developing countries to make promises of phasing out coal and fossil fuel subsidies?” Yadav said that towards poverty eradication, subsidies to certain fossil fuels provide much-needed social security and support. China also said the text was by no means perfect but it said it was willing to engage with other parties on concerns with the text. China insisted the expressions in the G20 statement on climate can be reflected in the Glasgow cover text.US special envoy on climate John Kerry said the China-US deal in Glasgow showed that despite conflict, countries can come together on the climate crisis, reach above conflict and differences to find common ground.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/climate-meet-in-glasgow-tense-final-hours-at-cop26-amid-tough-stands-on-deal-101636828370575.html
14-11-2021||India||COP26 summit in Glasgow proved to be a success, says India||Glasgow India on Sunday called the COP26 summit a “success”, saying it put across the concerns and ideas of the developing world quite “succinctly and unequivocally” in front of the world community.Negotiators from nearly 200 countries have accepted a new climate agreement after the COP26 summit in Glasgow concluded its extra time plenary on Saturday with a deal, which recognises India’s intervention for the world to “phase down” rather than “phase out” fossil fuels.Union Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav, head of the Indian delegation at the Glasgow conference, said that the world needs to awaken to the reality that the current climate crisis has been precipitated by unsustainable lifestyles and wasteful consumption patterns in the developed countries.“The summit proved to be a success from India’s standpoint because we articulated and put across the concerns and ideas of the developing world quite succinctly and unequivocally. India presented the way for a constructive debate and equitable and just solutions at the forum.“Consensus, however, remained elusive at COP26. India has maintained that the current climate crisis has been precipitated by unsustainable lifestyles and wasteful consumption patterns mainly in the developed countries. The world needs to awaken to this reality,” Yadav wrote on his blog on Sunday.The minister, who has been maintaining a blog ‘COP 26 Diary’, wrote that India, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has proactively taken the lead in creating the International Solar Alliance, Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI) and the One Sun, One World, One Sun Grid initiatives as examples of international collaboration to combat climate change.“Having done its part, India at the summit, asked the developed world concrete actions in this decisive decade and translation of commitments to actions,” he said.India has been criticised by several countries for the change promoted by it to phase down, rather than phase out coal power, the single biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions.Yadav said that fossil fuels and their use have enabled parts of the world to attain high levels of growth. “Even now, developed countries have not completely phased out coal. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) refers to mitigation of GHG emissions from all sources. UNFCCC is not directed at any particular source. Developing countries have a right to their fair share of the global carbon budget and are entitled to the responsible use of fossil fuels within this scope,” he said. The minister said that climate friendly lifestyles and climate justice as enshrined in the Paris Agreement are the key to solving the climate crisis. “We can proudly say today that India is the only G20 nation well on track to achieve the goals mentioned under the Paris Agreement. While there has been a lot of talk about and around Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC), the lack of commitment on climate finance is troublesome. “There is a wide mismatch between climate finance and mitigation efforts. The record on means of implementation support to developing countries has been dismal so far. India looks forward to a change in finance and technology support to developing countries going forward,” he said.In the end, the minister hoped that the world will rise to the urgency of the climate crisis “As I conclude my engagements at COP26 and return home, India is hopeful that the world will rise to the urgency of the climate crisis facing us and that alone will ensure we have real actions to save our planet for the future generations,” he said.“India, I am happy to note, achieved some remarkable results in terms of climate finance issues including a work program on new collective quantified goal, support for enhanced transparency framework for developing countries, Article 6 rule book, adaptation, common timeframe, at the COP26 negotiations,” he added.

He was addressing a gathering of High Court Chief Justices at the closing event of a legal awareness and outreach campaign organized by the National Legal Services Authority (NALSA).“For an overwhelming majority of litigants, what is real and existing is only the district judiciary,” CJI Ramana said, adding, “Without a robust justice delivery system at the grassroot level, we cannot imagine a healthy judiciary. Therefore, nothing is more important than to preserve, protect and promote the independence and integrity of the judiciary at all levels.”Stressing on the need to make citizens aware of their legal rights and to secure them, the CJI, who is also the Patron-in-Chief of NALSA, said, “The stark divide between haves and have nots is still a reality. No matter how many cherished declarations we successfully arrive at, in the face of poverty, inequity and deprivations, it will all seem pointless…. efficient legal aid service forms the backbone of a proficient justice delivery system, as it brings people closer to us.”As the mind of the Indian judiciary is known to millions through the actions of the trial court and the district judiciary, CJI said, “It is the trial court which is approached first by a woman in distress, a child in need of care, or an illegal detenue.” He urged the High Courts to play an important role in supervising and overseeing effective functioning of all district courts within their jurisdiction.The CJI said decisions by courts have a huge social impact and for this reason, he stressed that judgments given by Courts should be “easily comprehensible and must be written in simple and clear language.” He told the gathered Chief Justices and judges of High Courts that the ability of constitutional courts to function with absolute independence and necessary boldness in the face of adversity is the only way to sustain the impeccable character of this institution and to live up to the faith of people.President Ram Nath Kovind had inaugurated NALSA’s pan-India Legal Awareness and Outreach event on October 2 that ended on Sunday. The valedictory event was also attended by NALSA Executive Chairman and Supreme Court judge, Justice UU Lalit along with Supreme Court Legal Services Committee Chairman Justice AM Khanwilkar, Attorney General KK Venugopal and Union Women and Child Development minister Smriti Zubin Irani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/preserve-protect-judiciary-s-independence-and-integrity-cji-to-high-courts-101636914314520.html
14-11-2021||India||No pre-poll alliance, will contest on all 403 seats in UP election, says Priyanka Gandhi||Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi on Sunday ruled out a pre-poll alliance with any political party and said that the party would go solo in the upcoming assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh. Lashing out at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for misleading people that Congress has a weak organisation in Uttar Pradesh, Priyanka said, “We will show them our strength by contesting alone on 403 seats in the forthcoming assembly elections in UP. How can they say that we have a weak organisation when over 18,000 workers and leaders of our party had been booked for raising issues of the public? We didn’t see Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) fighting for public issues in the past two years,” said Priyanka while interacting with workers of the party and frontal organisations at a party workers’ conference in Bulandshahr on Sunday. Congress leaders and workers from 14 districts of Meerut, Aligarh and Agra divisions attended the conference. She also paid tribute to Pt Jawaharlal Nehru on his birth anniversary in the beginning of the workers’ meet. Spokesperson of Meerut district Congress committee, Harkishan Verma, who attended the meet, said that Priyanka asked workers to be more active on social media in order to counter lies, fake news and propaganda by the ruling BJP. “Elections are won on the strength of women party workers,” she said while calling upon leaders to have a team of at least 25 women workers at each booth. She said that two of them should actively coordinate with others for effective execution of the party’s activities. The Congress leader accused the BJP of trying to write a new definition of the country and Independence. She asked party workers to reach out to people and explain how the Constitution is in danger under BJP’s rule. She also asked party workers to inform people about the party’s decisions for the welfare of women and people of different segments of the society. “Each worker should associate at least five families with the party,” she added. The Congress leader said that Mahatma Gandhi, Nehru, Sardar Patel, Baba Saheb Ambedkar and others sacrificed their lives for Independence. “But the BJP leadership does not know the meaning of Independence. Only a few people enjoy independence today. The family of Hathras rape victim had no independence of doing the last rites of the girl. Now, the time has come to re-do the slogan of ‘Do or die’,” Priyanka said. She said that people are in deep trouble due to increasing prices of essential commodities. “Petrol price were at ₹70 in the past 70 years which has now risen to ₹100 and beyond in the past seven years,” she said. Party’s state president Ajay Kumar ‘Lallu’ and other Congress leaders accompanied Priyanka, who interacted with several delegations from each district to have their feedback about what more could be done to strengthen the party further. A similar conference of Saharanpur, Moradabad and Bareilly divisions will be held in Moradabad on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-pre-poll-alliance-will-contest-on-all-403-seats-in-up-election-says-priyanka-gandhi-101636910952927.html
14-11-2021||India||Incessant rain continues to batter Kerala, south Tamil Nadu||Torrential rain continued to pound the two southern states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu as the north-east monsoon turned vigorous leaving a trail of destruction. In Kerala, the shutters of the Idukki dam were opened again on Sunday to ease pressure—this is the first time that the shutters are being opened twice a year. Though there is some respite in Chennai, heavy rain battered the southern districts of Tamil Nadu. The shutters of the Idukki dam were opened on October 19, after the district received heavy rainfall that triggered flash floods and landslides claiming many lives. The 45-year-old dam, Asia’s largest arch dam, was opened only five times since its inception and that shows the intensity of rain in catchment areas. Out of the total capacity of 2,403 feet, the water level had risen to 2,398 feet on Sunday forcing authorities to open the shutters. “We have opened just one shutter for 40 cm now and in a second 40,000 litres are getting released. We are monitoring the situation and if need be more shutters will be opened,” said state Water Resources Minister Roshy Augustine, camping in the district. More than 200 relief camps have been opened in the two worst hit districts, Pathanamthitta and Idukki. Tamil Nadu also informed the state that if the situation continued the spillways of the Mullaperiyar dam will also be opened. Water level in Mullaperiyar crossed 140 feet on Sunday. Kerala has been put on high alert as many dams are filled to the brim and Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has called an emergency meeting later on Sunday evening. The India Meteorology Department had sounded a red alert in three districts (Idukki, Ernakulam and Thrissur) and another orange alert in six other districts. Some areas in Idukki and Pathanamthitta districts received around 220 mm rain in the last two days. People living near water bodies have been asked to keep vigil. In the second week of October, 42 people died in Kerala after heavy rainfall triggered flash floods and landslides. The usual rainfall during north-east monsoon in Kerala is 492 mm between October 1 and December 31, but this time between October 1 and November 6 the state received 716 mm rain against the expected fall of 387.9 mm, IMD statistics show. Going by the present pattern, rainfall will be at least 200 per cent higher than the usual rate by the end of December. IMD attributed the heavy rainfall to a low pressure brewing near the southern Andaman Sea and it is likely to intensify in the next 48 hours. “We can’t ignore signals of climate change. Changing rain pattern is one of them. We have to expect the unexpected in such scenarios. We have to strengthen our early warning system and need more studies to lessen impact of such changes. We desperately need more studies on climate change,” said Dr MG Manoj of the Advanced Centre for Atmospheric Radar Research with the Cochin University of Science and Technology. Though Chennai and adjacent districts received two heavy spells last week that crippled the region and several areas continued to be inundated, it had some respite over the weekend. But heavy rain lashed the southern districts of Kanyakumari, Tirunelveli and Thoothukudi causing severe flooding. Two areas in Kanyakumari district recorded 220 mm of rainfall, said the Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC). As many as 3,278 people were moved to relief camps in the district. The heavy rainfall in neighbouring Kerala also impacted railway traffic between Kanyakumari and Thiruvananthapuram so the southern railway cancelled four trains and partially cancelled 11 trains and announced changes in timings. Tamil Nadu has received excess rainfall this northeast monsoon. Overnight between November 6 and 7, Chennai recorded 210 mm of rain and on November 12 the average rainfall was 60.6 mm. From November 7 up to 12, Tamil Nadu recorded 110 mm rainfall, S Balachandran, head, RMC Chennai told reporters on Friday. “Chennai has recorded 46 cm rainfall which is five times the average we receive during this period which is 8cm.” From October 1, when the north east monsoon began up to November 12, Chennai has received 81 cm rainfall while the average is 44 cm.” This is 85% excess,” the RMC head had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/incessant-rain-continues-to-batter-kerala-south-tamil-nadu-101636909751189.html

14-11-2021||India||Delivery of S-400 air defence systems has begun, says Russian official||Russia has begun delivering the S-400 air defence system to India, a senior Russian official has said ahead of President Vladimir Putin’s visit to New Delhi for a planned annual summit. The delivery of the S-400 systems to India is going as planned, Dmitry Shugaev, director of Russia’s Federal Service for Military-Technical Cooperation, told the state-run Sputnik news service. “The supplies of the S-400 air defence system to India have started and are proceeding on schedule,” Shugaev said, without giving further details. There was no official word from the Indian side on the development. Hindustan Times had reported last week that the delivery of the first batch of S-400 systems is expected to coincide with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s visit to New Delhi in December for the annual summit, which will set the stage for the two countries renewing their military-technical cooperation for the next decade. The two countries had signed a $5.4-billion contract for five S-400 systems during Putin’s last visit to India for the annual summit in October 2018. India has in recent months signalled its intention to go ahead with the deal despite the US warning that it could attract secondary sanctions under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA). Several teams of Indian Air Force personnel have been trained in Russia to operate the air defence system that will be used to protect key cities, strategic installations and sensitive stretches of the country’s borders. Russian officials have said deliveries of all the systems are expected to be completed within five years of the signing of the contract. The IAF is expected to induct the first unit of S-400 systems at a time when India is locked in a border standoff with China, which has deployed two S-400 squadrons at Hotan airbase in Xinjiang and Nyingchi airbase in Tibet, across Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh respectively. The S-400 is currently in service with the militaries of China and Turkey. In August, the head of Russia’s state arms exporter Rosoboronexport, Alexander Mikheev, had said negotiations on supplying the S-400 were underway with seven countries in West Asia, the Asia-Pacific region and Africa. Putin is expected to be in New Delhi in the second week of December for the annual summit, with the two countries looking at December 6 as the most likely date for the meeting. His visit will be preceded by the maiden 2+2 dialogue of the defence and foreign ministers of India and Russia in Moscow. At the summit, the two sides are expected to renew their military-technical cooperation arrangement for 2021-31 and sign several agreements, including the Reciprocal Exchange of Logistics Agreement (RELOS) to allow access to logistics and support facilities at each other’s military bases and ports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delivery-of-s-400-air-defence-systems-has-begun-says-russian-official-101636907111128.html
14-11-2021||India||HT THIS DAY: November 15, 2015 — Paris attacked, 127 slaughtered in six coordinated attacks, IS says more coming||Paris – French President Francois Hollande vowed on Saturday to launch a “pitiless” attack on the Islamic State after the jihadist group orchestrated a coordinated assault by gunmen and bombers that killed at least 127 people across locations in Paris.Hollande called Friday night’s shootings at Paris cafes, suicide bombings near France’s national stadium and a hostage-taking slaughter inside a concert hall —all in under an hour — “an act of war that was prepared, organised, planned from abroad with internal help”.“Faced with war, the country must take appropriate action. All measures to protect our compatriots and our territory are being taken within the framework of the state of emergency,” he said after the deadliest attacks to hit his nation since World War II.France has been on edge since January, when Islamic extremists attacked the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, which had run cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad, and a kosher grocery. Twenty people died in those attacks, including three shooters.Experts said the brazen strikes — that also injured more than 200 people — were a copycat of the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks with militants choosing crowded locations in Paris and food joints.“The militants opened fired at a Paris restaurant like at Mumbai’s Leopold café. Similarly, crowded areas like Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CST) were targeted as the attackers hit a packed stadium and a rock concert in Paris,” said V Balachandran, former special secretary and a member of a commission that probed the 26/11 violence.In a statement, the Islamic State admitted responsibility and said eight fighters “wrapped in explosive belts and armed with rifles” carried out synchronised attacks. All were killed.It said the assaults were designed to show France would remain a top target as long as it continued playing a role in bombing IS targets in Syria and Iraq.The cold-blooded massacre was part of what terror experts call a “high impact, low cost” attack that is difficult to apprehend due to the use of simple weapons and minimum logistical backup.As Hollande addressed the nation, authorities expressed concern that many of the attackers could be home home-grown as an estimated 5,000 to 6,000 Europeans have flocked to join the IS ranks – with France being the single-largest source of recruits.Analysts said the massacre – that came days after the IS allegedly shot down a Russian plane, killing over 240 people – showed the group was preparing to inflict enough damage to drive foreign governments from the anti-IS coalition.As news of the bloodbath spread, world leaders united in sympathy and indignation, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying the people of India felt “the shock, pain and outrage of the people of France”.“India stands firmly with the great people of France in dealing with the tragedy. And we must stand together as humanity in combating the major global threat to our times and uphold our values and our way of life,” he said. Foreign minister Sushma Swaraj confirmed no Indian had died.A defiant France refused to cancel a landmark climate conference in Paris that begins on November 30 and is expected to see over 100 heads of state in attendance but strengthened security measures.French anti-terror police also worked to identify potential accomplices and said eight died, seven in suicide bombings, a new terror tactic in France. Police said they shot and killed the other assailant. A Greek minister later on Saturday said the holder of a Syrian passport found near the body of one of the gunmen passed though Greece in October.Suicide bombs targeted spots around the national Stade de France stadium, where Hollande was watching an exhibition soccer match. Fans inside the stadium recoiled at the sound of explosions, but the match continued amid rising spectator fears.Around the same time, bullets shattered the clinking of wine glasses in a trendy Paris neighbourhood as gunmen targeted a string of crowded cafes, killing at least 37 people.The deadliest attack was on the Bataclan, a popular concert venue where the Californian rock group Eagles of Death Metal was performing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htthisday-november-15-2015-paris-attacked-127-slaughtered-in-six-coordinated-attacks-is-says-more-coming-101636906157076.html

Two Bhind residents Suraj Pawaiya and Vijendra Singh Tomar were arrested with 20 kg of Marijuana from a road side eatery at Gohad, said Manoj Kumar Singh,the Bhind police chief.“These two accused are part of a drug peddling gang which has a network across the nation. Police are trying to nab the other four identified and six unidentified accused,” Singh said.“A company registered in 2007 as an Ahmedabad-based textile firm, Babu Tex Private Limited, which used to sell Marijuana as stevia dry leaves. Acting on a tip-off, police raided a Dhaba in Gohad of Bhind and recovered packaging material of amazon e-commercial company and two air tickets from Visakhapatnam to Delhi,” said Singh. Police claims that during interrogation, Pawaiya revealed that they used to send marijuana from Visakhapatnam to agents at Bhind, Agra, Delhi, Gwalior and Kota. “The supply used to be suspended most of the time and would resume when it was bought by the agents. On the site, the price of 2 Kg leaves was shown as ₹180 and the payment used to be done online,” said Om Prakash Mishra, in-charge, Gohad police station.

14-11-2021||India||Army chief Gen Naravane heads to Israel to boost defence ties||Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane on Sunday left for Israel on a five-day official visit to discuss avenues for enhancing bilateral defence relations. His visit comes weeks after the India-Israel joint working group (JWG) on defence cooperation decided to set up a task force to put together a comprehensive 10-year roadmap to identify new areas of collaboration. “The army chief will take forward the excellent bilateral defence cooperation between Israel and India through multiple meetings with senior officials of the (Israeli) security establishment and exchange views on various defence related issues,” the army said in a statement. This is Naravane’s first visit to Israel. The army chief’s Israel visit comes after external affairs minister S Jaishankar visited that country last month. Israel has been among India’s top three arms suppliers for the last five years, according to a report published by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri) in March 2021. Israel accounted for 13% of India’s imports during 2016-20 after Russia (49%) and France (18%). The decision to form the task force to identify new areas of cooperation for the next decade was taken during the 15th JWG meeting co-chaired by defence secretary Ajay Kumar and his Israeli counterpart Major General Gen Amir Eshel (retd) in October-end. India and Israel also agreed to form a sub-working group on defence industry cooperation for efficient utilisation of resources, effective flow of technologies and sharing industrial capabilities. The ongoing border conflict with China in Ladakh forced India last year to speed up the purchase of military hardware from several countries including Israel, officials said.

The incident took place at the foothills of Maoist-dominated Maunwar village at Dumaria police station in Gaya district with the rebels blowing up houses of the deceased and also setting a motorcycle on fire apart from the killings, which they said was just punishment for passing information to police and CRPF, which had earlier resulted in the encounter of four Maoists-- zonal commander Amresh Singh alias Tuntun Bhokta (Gaya), sub-zonal commander Shivpujan Yadav alias Pramod, Uday Paswan and Sita Bhuiyan (all three from Aurangabad district) on March 16.The deceased have been identified as Satyendra Bhokta, his wife Manorma Devi, brother Mahendra Bhokta and Mahendra’s wife Sunita Devi. All the four were reported to be related to Saryug Singh Bhokta, a special police officer (SPO). In the last two and half years in Bihar, the ultras have killed at least 22 civilians believing them to be spies, data shows. Also Read: Manipur ambush brings China role in Northeast back in focusAccording to reports, a group of armed members of outlawed CPI (Maoist) outfit stormed into the village at around 12.30 am and abducted Bhokta brothers from their houses at gun point. They fired several blank rounds and lobbed explosives to terrorise the villagers before vanishing into nearby hilly and forest area, where they assaulted the four abducted men before shooting them dead about 100 metres from a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) camp at Chakarbandha. Gaya SSP Aditya Kumar said villagers recovered the bodies from the premises of a cowshed where they had been hung. Police also found handwritten Maoist posters from the spot, stating the men had been killed since they were “police informers”. They also warned villagers of similar consequences in case they opted to be police informers. The pamphlet were reportedly written by Jan Mukti Chhapakar Sena, Madhya Zone Jharkhand (Maoists). The SSP added that a search operation had been launched in Gaya and adjoining Palamu district of Jharkhand. The bodies had been sent to ANMCH for post-mortem.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maoists-shoot-4-of-bihar-family-on-suspicion-of-being-police-informers-101636897749168.html
14-11-2021||India||Army to get firepower boost in mountains with more M777 guns||The Indian Army is set to scale up its capabilities with more M777 ultra-light howitzers that can be swiftly deployed and redeployed in mountains, amid the ongoing border row with China in Ladakh, people familiar with the developments said on Sunday. India ordered 145 howitzers from the US for $750 million in November 2016. “The army will receive 56 more M777 guns by June 2022. As of now, 89 howitzers have been delivered,” said one of the persons cited above. The army has deployed M777s in Ladakh, where India and China have been locked in a border row for over 18 months, and also in Arunachal Pradesh across which the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has stepped up its activities. M777 manufacturer BAE Systems has delivered 25 ready-built howitzers and the remaining guns have been/are being built locally in collaboration with Mahindra Defence under the Modi government’s Make in India initiative. The 155 mm/39-caliber M777 howitzers have a range of up to 30km, but it is capable of striking targets at ranges of more than 40 km in some areas where the geography allows the shells to fly in rarefied air. “The howitzer can be easily moved from one area to another depending on the requirement. The induction of the remaining M777s will provide a big boost to the army,” said Lieutenant General SL Narasimhan (retd), a member of the National Security Advisory Board.Built with titanium and aluminum alloys, the howitzers weigh 4,218 kg. In contrast, 155mm towed guns weigh twice as much. The Indian Air Force’s CH-47F Chinook helicopters can carry the howitzers as underslung load for swift deployment in high-altitude areas. “There are many places where heavier artillery guns cannot be deployed because of the terrain. But the M777s can be sling-loaded to Chinooks and swiftly inserted there,” Brigadier Sanjeev Kumar, the commander of an artillery brigade in Arunachal Pradesh, previously said. The M777s are a key component of the army’s field artillery rationalisation plan (FARP), cleared in 1999. The ₹50,000-crore FARP lays down the road map for inducting new 155mm weaponry, including tracked self-propelled guns, truck-mounted gun systems, towed artillery pieces and wheeled self-propelled guns. The plan seeks to equip 169 artillery regiments with a mix of nearly 3,000 guns over the next decade. The M777 order in 2016 was the first contract for artillery guns in almost 30 years after the Bofors scandal erupted in the late 1980s. Apart from M777s, the army has also deployed the K9 Vajra-T self-propelled artillery guns and the 155 mm FH 77 BO2 guns (better known as Bofors) in the Ladakh sector. Private sector defence major Larsen & Toubro and South Korea’s Hanwha Techwin (HTW) have built the highly mobile K9 guns in India. The guns were meant to be deployed in the plains, but the army has carried out some minor changes to deploy them in high altitude. India and China have hardened their positions on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh with increased military activities on both sides of the boundary, infrastructure development, surveillance and combat manoeuvres by their armies. Despite two rounds of disengagement at friction points on LAC this year, the two armies still have 50,000 to 60,000 troops each and advanced weaponry deployed in Ladakh. PLA did not agree to suggestions made by the Indian Army at the 13th round of military talks on October 10 to cool tensions in Ladakh. The Indian Army said it made constructive suggestions for resolving outstanding problems but the Chinese side was not agreeable and also could not provide any forward-looking proposals, while China accused India of unreasonable and unrealistic demands in an unusually aggressive statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-to-get-firepower-boost-in-mountains-with-more-m777-guns-101636896249075.html

The order comes into force with immediate effect and shall remain operational till November 17, the government said. The decision comes a day after Delhi decided to suspend physical classes for a week starting from November 15 to shield the children from the adverse impact of the pollution.Apart from closing schools, the Delhi government has asked government departments to switch to 100% work from home and urged the private offices to work from home as much as possible for a week.The Haryana government has also advised all government and private offices to switch to work from home so that at least vehicles plying on roads can be reduced by 30%. The government has also put a complete ban on all types of construction and development activities in these four districts, where the pollution situation is nearly as hazardous as Delhi. "No trash burning by Municipal bodies will be allowed and stubble burning will be prohibited. No manual sweeping of roads will e allowed," reads the order.The pollution situation in Delhi and surrounding areas including Gurugram worsened in the last few days with the Air Quality Index reaching 471 on Friday, the worst of this season. The Supreme Court on Saturday expressed concern over the situation and said people are wearing masks even inside their houses. Drawing attention to the suffering of the children who have started attending physical classes after a long gap owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, the apex court nudged the governments (Centre and state) to immediately draw up an action plan.The AQI of Noida and Gurugram on Saturday was worse than Delhi as Noida recorded an AQI of 587 and Gurugram 557.The AQI of Delhi-NCR is likely to improve within a few days as the calm weather has aggravated the pollution. Once the wind gathers velocity, the AQI level is expected to be better. According to the met department, an improvement in the condition is likely only after Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/schools-in-gurguram-faridabad-sonipat-to-be-shut-from-nov-17-for-pollution-101636893755634.html

14-11-2021||India||Manipur ambush brings China role in Northeast back in focus||A deadly ambush near the Myanmar border in Manipur that killed five soldiers including a colonel, his wife and their eight-year-old son on Saturday has brought China’s possible support to insurgencies in India’s Northeast back in focus, and the neighbour may be plotting to foment trouble in the region amid border tensions, China watchers and security officials said on Sunday. This is not the first time that Chinese links with insurgent groups have come under scrutiny. Questions about Beijing’s involvement have been raised previously too including in October 2020 when China’s propaganda machinery warned India against a trade pact with Taiwan saying Beijing could retaliate by supporting Northeast separatists and stop recognising Sikkim as a part of India. “The possibility of China fuelling insurgency in the Northeast exists. Insurgent outfits in the Northeast, including Manipur, have links with armed groups such as Arakan Army and United Wa State Army in Myanmar from where Chinese weapons are finding their way into the Northeast,” a senior official said. China has also provided safe havens to insurgent leaders including United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA) commander Paresh Baruah and National Socialist Council of Nagaland (IM)’s Phunting Shimrang who live in Ruili in Yunnan Province across the Myanmar border with China, said another official. Armed militants ambushed an Assam Rifles convoy in Manipur’s Churachandpur district on Saturday when the commanding officer of the 46 Assam Rifles, Colonel Viplav Tripathi, and his quick reaction team (QRT) were returning from the Behiang border post and heading to the battalion headquarters at Khuga. The Revolutionary People’s Front (RPF), a group under which the People’s Liberation Army Manipur operates, jointly claimed responsibility for the ambush along with the Manipur Naga People’s Front but said it wasn’t aware of the presence of family members in the convoy. China may have re-established its links with PLA Manipur and other like-minded groups in the backdrop of the situation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), said Lieutenant General Shokin Chauhan (retd), who headed the Assam Rifles in 2017-18. “This may have been done to unleash mayhem in the Northeast and tie down the security forces,” he said. The attackers first triggered an improvised explosive device (IED) and then brought the Assam Rifles personnel under heavy fire to inflict maximum casualties, bringing back memories of the June 2015 Chandel ambush in the state in which a Dogra battalion of the Indian Army lost 18 men. The latest ambush came at a time when the security situation in the Northeast had improved significantly in the army’s assessment, and a planned and gradual drawdown of soldiers is underway there. China may not have previously interfered directly but things could change amid tensions at the LAC as insurgent groups in the Northeast have Chinese links, said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd), who commanded the Leimakhong-headquartered 57 Mountain Division in Manipur in 2009-10. India and China have hardened their positions on LAC in Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh going by increased military activities on both sides of the boundary, infrastructure development, surveillance and combat manoeuvres by their armies. The two sides have been locked in a border row for more than 18 months. Given the situation on LAC, there is a possibility of China making attempts to wage a different form of warfare in the Northeast to put pressure on India, said Lieutenant General Konsam Himalay Singh, who retired in 2017 and is the first army officer from the Northeast to reach the three-star rank. “Insurgent groups have access to Chinese-made weapons and some self-styled commanders are living in China. But the exact scale of Chinese support to these groups is hard to establish,” said a top official who specialises in security dynamics of the Northeast. The Chinese link with Northeastern groups was raised by Indian national security advisor Shivshankar Menon with state councillor Dai Bingguo at the 15th India-China Special Representative talks almost a decade ago. Dai denied the Chinese involvement and instead accused India of training and funding Tibetan insurgents against China. The latest attack is also an attempt by insurgents to re-establish their relevance at a time when violent incidents have come down, officials said. Security forces have launched a massive manhunt for the insurgents who carried out the ambush but they may have slipped across the border into Myanmar. The aftershocks of the hit were felt in New Delhi, with the government vowing swift action against the insurgents on Saturday. Prime Minister Narendra Modi condemned the attack and said the sacrifice of the soldiers and the family members will never be forgotten. Defence minister Rajnath Singh said the perpetrators of the attack would be brought to justice swiftly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/manipur-ambush-brings-china-role-in-northeast-back-in-focus-101636891328423.html

14-11-2021||India||5 Assam women who left homes to ‘join’ banned ULFA-I still missing||Days after they went missing reportedly to join the banned United Liberation Front of Asom-Independent (ULFA-I), police in Assam are yet to trace the whereabouts of five women including two who took part in national-level kickboxing meets. As per missing complaints lodged by family members of the women with the police, there’s no trace of them since the past week. After a video of them trekking inside a forested area surfaced online on Friday, it has been speculated they might be on their way to Myanmar to get trained in ULFA-I camps there. The video showed kick boxers Nayanmani Chetia of Tinsukia district, Sabita Chetia of Dhemaji district and another woman identified as Sarmistha Saikia of Lakhimpur district. The identities of the two other women in the video, said to be from Majuli and Marigaon districts, aren’t disclosed yet. According to statements by Nayanmani’s brother to local media outlets, her husband works in Assam Police and she has a 5-6 year old son. Before disappearing, she had told family members that she’s going for a kick boxing tournament with other girls. “Ever since reports surfaced and complaints were received about the missing women on November 11, we’ve been trying to trace their locations. But that hasn’t been possible yet. Their mobile phones are also switched off,” said Additional DGP (Special Branch) Hiren Nath. He mentioned that it won’t be possible to comment whether the missing women have actually joined the banned outfit. Nath added that investigations are underway to verify the location of the video and when it was clicked. “We’ve found that the missing women had a strange relationship with family members. One would disappear from home for 15-20 days at a stretch and another had very irregular timings and often used to reach home very late at night without informing family members,” said Nath. “It’s not uncommon for young people in some areas of Assam to leave their families to join insurgent outfits. We’ve been able to catch many who were on their way to training or were being indoctrinated to join. Recently we arrested 14 such young men in Upper Assam,” he added. On Saturday, ULFA-I publicity cell member Rumel Asom sent an email to an Assamese daily accusing a few media outlets of “outburst” on the “normal” issue of few women joining it. He accused them of speculating that one of them had joined the outfit due to romantic relations with an existing cadre. “There’s no need for such outburst on the women joining ULFA-I. It’s very normal that some members of the public, who are attracted by the goal and ideals of our outfit, come and join us,” the email, which was published on Sunday’s Amar Asom, read. On Sunday, ULFA-I chairman Paresh Baruah announced through a statement that the outfit had extended its ceasefire for another three months in “public interest” and it would refrain from all kinds of “military activities” during the period. Since May this year, when the second Bharatiya Janata Party-led government assumed office in Assam, there have been speculations that ULFA-I, which seeks an independent Assam, could join peace talks with the Centre. The outfit, has, however maintained that the issue of Assam’s sovereignty should be part of talks. Citing the Covid-19 pandemic, ULFA-I declared an unilateral ceasefire in May for three months. It was extended by another three months in August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-assam-women-who-left-homes-to-join-banned-ulfa-i-still-missing-101636888507630.html
14-11-2021||India||Centre brings in ordinance to extend tenure of CBI, ED chiefs up to 5 years||In a controversial decision, 15-days before Parliament’s session is due to begin, the Centre on Sunday brought in an ordinance amending the Delhi Police Special Establishment (DPSE) Act and the Central Vigilance Act (CVC) to extend the tenure of Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) chiefs up to five years. The extension includes the fixed two year terms for the directors of both the premier investigation agencies. The development comes two months after the Supreme Court ruled that extensions beyond the date of superannuation of an individual should be rare, in exceptional cases only. The apex court had asked the Centre not to further extend the tenure of current ED Director Sanjay Kumar Mishra, whose already extended tenure ends in a week’s time. The decision of the Court in September came on a petition filed by NGO Common Cause which challenged the government’s decision of November 13, 2020 to retrospectively grant an extension to Mishra by converting his original tenure of two years beginning November 19, 2018 into a three-year one. The decision met the approval of the High-Powered Committee chaired by Central Vigilance Commissioner in the interest of supervising some important investigations handled by ED that were at a crucial stage.However, the latest ordinance is likely to circumvent the SC ruling and make Mishra eligible for another two years’ extension. The ordinance, amending Section 25 of the CVC Act, states that the extension of five years will include the original appointment of fixed two-year tenure. Both CBI and ED chiefs have a fixed tenure of two years. The ordinance has been promulgated by the President of India. Currently, Subodh Kumar Jaiswal is the Director of CBI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-brings-in-ordinance-to-extend-tenure-of-cbi-ed-chiefs-up-to-5-years-101636886107166.html

Speaking at the virtual event, PM Modi said that the first instalment of PMAY-G has given new morale to the dreams of Tripura and the entire northeast is witnessing change. He thanked Tripura chief minister Biplab Deb for “changing the government culture” and “old ways of working.”“I thank Biplab Deb and his govt for changing the government culture, old ways of working, and old attitude within such a short span of time. The youthful energy with which Biplab Deb is working, that energy can be seen across Tripura today,” he said.PMAY-G is an ambitious mission of the Modi government aimed at providing “housing for all” by 2022 when India completes 75 years of Independence. According to Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), more than ₹700 crore was to be credited directly to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries on the occasion.Criticising the previous governments at the Centre, the prime minister said that earlier policies were formed behind closed doors in the national capital and “unsuccessful attempts were made to fit the northeast in this.” He told the PMAY-G beneficiaries in Tripura that the closed-door policies led to segregation which the country has fixed in the last seven years with a new mindset and new approach.“Now policies are formed as per the needs of the region, and not only as per Delhi,” he added.Referring to the BJP-led governments at both Centre and in the state, PM Modi said that the “double engine” government is working together for the development of Tripura with “all their energy and honesty.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-transfers-700-crore-to-tripura-pmay-g-beneficiaries-says-entire-northeast-witnessing-change-101636883004331.html

The present tenure of the central government agency chiefs is two years."Provided that the period for which the Director of Enforcement holds the office on his initial appointment may, in public interest, on the recommendation of the Committee under clause(a) and for the reason to be recorded in writing, be extended up to one year at a time," the Central Vigilance Commission (Amendment) Ordinance 2021 said."Provided further that no such extension shall be granted after the completion of a period of five years in total including the period mentioned in the initial appointment," the ordinance said.The other ordinance 'The Delhi Special Police Establishment (Amendment) Ordinance, 2021' also has the similar amendment and comes into force at once.The Congress criticised the decision as Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi tweeted, “Double whammy regarding  5 yr tenures for misused agency heads. Ordinance Raj, the favourite route of the Modi govt, bypasses Parliament scrutiny 14 days before Parliament meets. Extensions per se frowned upon by apex court.

Ramrati ji, the National President of Bahujan Samaj Party and mother of former Chief Minister of UP, Ms @Mayawati. May God give her a place near Him and give courage to the family members to bear the pain during this grief. Om Shanti.”This comes during the often bitter election campaign ahead of the UP elections next year. When Priyanka Gandhi announced that women will get 40 per cent of the election tickets, Mayawati called it nothing but “election drama”. She added that if the Congress party was really concerned about inclusion, then why did their government not make a law to give 33 per cent reservation to women in Parliament and legislative assemblies.Priyanka Gandhi also lashed out at Mayawati, saying that she failed to raise her voice during the Hathras rape case and the Lakhimpur Kheri violence. “Where is Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati? For the last two years, whether it was the Hathras incident or (recent incident in) Lakhimpur Kheri, it's only Congress which raised issues in Uttar Pradesh,” she said.With the UP assembly elections coming up in February 2022, tensions between political parties have risen especially with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the opposition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/priyanka-gandhi-visits-mayawati-offers-condolences-for-her-mother-s-death-101636879124315.html

Most such offences related to publishing or transmitting materials showing children in sexually explicit acts, the report said.Stating that a total of 842 instances of cyber crime targeting kids were reported in 2020, the report stated that among these, 738 or nearly 87 per cent depicted minors engaged in sexual acts. In comparison, a total of 164 cyber crimes against children were reported in 2019, 413 per cent lower than those in 2020. The corresponding figures for 2017 and 2018 stood at 79 and 117, respectively.As per the NCRB's 2020 data, Uttar Pradesh, at 170, recorded the highest number of online offences against kids, followed by Karnataka and Maharashtra, where 144 and 137 crimes of this nature took place. Kerala (107) and Odisha (71) stood fourth and fifth on this list.Speaking on the numbers, Puja Marwaha, CEO, CRY (Child Rights and You), said that spending more time on the internet for educational and communication purposes has, unfortunately, also resulted in children becoming more vulnerable to multiple risks, including those related to online sexual abuse. “There is a limited understanding among caregivers, educators and society regarding the risks that kids may face online. There is a need to make them understand what children should know, so that the former can appropriately guide the latter,” Marwaha said.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyber-crimes-against-children-in-2020-rose-over-400-from-2019-ncrb-report-101636876552282.html

Are those chapters in our history a bheekh?” she further wrote to the President.Also read | Vishal Dadlani reminds Kangana Ranaut of Bhagat Singh ‘so she never again dares to forget’Maliwal said this was not a stray incident and Ranaut did not appear to be in sound mind as she habitually spewed venom against people of her own country. “She repeatedly used vile language to attack those she does not agree with,” the DCW chief said.She further said Ranaut’s behaviour was in no way befitting of the recipient of the highest award in the country and was also an insult to the stalwarts who received the awards with and before her.Ranaut was awarded the Padma Shri earlier this month along with a host of other artists.Politicians across the spectrum, including BJP member of Parliament Varun Gandhi, Maharashtra BJP chief Chandrakant Patil, Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik and Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel, have criticised Ranaut for her statement.Defending her statements, the actor said she was ready to return her Padma Shri if someone could enlighten her about what took place in 1947.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dcw-chief-writes-to-prez-kovind-urging-kangana-s-padma-shri-be-taken-back-101636877254138.html

The corridor allows pilgrims visa-free access to the final resting place of Guru Nanak, which is just four kilometers from the international border. The construction of the corridor has been touted by the BJP as one of the many accomplishments of the Modi Government, and recently came up for mention in the national executive committee meeting of the BJP.Bikramjit Singh Cheema, who was part of the delegation, said the Sikh community feels that Kartarpur corridor should now be reopened with precautions. He said that the issue is of reverence not only to the Sikh community but to all those who follow the Guru’s teaching.

Bommai said that while his government took all necessary actions, including arresting the culprit and handing him over to federal investigating agencies, the Congress had set the accused free and did not conduct a proper inquiry when in power.Slamming Congress leaders, including Randeep Surjewala, who have accused the BJP government of a cover-up in the multi-crore Bitcoin scam, Bommai said, “They (Congress) say that matter is from 2016. If there was anything related to Karnataka, why did Surjewala not ask the then ministers and CM about it? Why did they not notice the issue then?”Also read | In PM Modi's meet on crypto, concerns expressed over terror-financing, misleading youthThe Congress has alleged that 'influential politicians' are involved in the scam after officials seized bitcoins worth ₹9 crore from a city-based hacker, Srikrishna alias Sriki, who is also accused of hacking into government portals, sourcing drugs through the dark net and paying for it through cryptocurrency. It has demanded an independent investigation conducted into the matter by a Supreme Court-monitored SIT with former party chief Rahul Gandhi stating the scam is big but the cover-up is much bigger.However, Bommai said, “In 2018, they caught the accused but then they set him free.

The drive was initially slated for November 6 but was deferred due to the onset of the northeast monsoon and a request by the state healthcare workers on account of Diwali.“The 8th "Mega Vaccine Camp" is scheduled to be held at 50000 centers under the guidance of the Hon'ble Chief Minister (MK Stalin),” state health minister Ma Subramanian tweeted earlier in the day. The minister is also scheduled to inspect various vaccination camps at Chennai and the adjoining Tiruvallur district.Of the 50,000 centres across the state, 2,000 centres are being operated in Chennai, the city’s civic body said. “2,000 vaccination camps are being held across Chennai.

14-11-2021||India||100% 1st dose administered, now, Mumbai eyes full vaccination||Three hundred and one days after the nationwide Covid-19 vaccination programme was rolled out on January 16, Mumbai achieved 100% first dose coverage on Saturday, November 13. By 10pm Saturday, the city had overshot its target to vaccinate the eligible adult population of 9,236,546 with at least one dose by 0.18% and administered 9,253,647 first doses and 6,033,148 double doses, according to the Central government’s CoWin dashboard, taking the city’s full vaccination coverage to 65%.To be sure, Mumbai may have statistically achieved the milestone of 100% first dose coverage, but the city will have to administer many more doses to truly cover its entire adult population. The reason: An estimated 10-20% people who have got the Covid-19 vaccine in Mumbai are likely to be from other parts of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) or the rest of Maharashtra.“We are definitely accounting for this slight mismatch. Therefore, our vaccination drive will continue aggressively,” said Mumbai’s executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare. “We will have to go much beyond 100%,” she added.Absolute coverage may therefore be a few more days away, experts said, and a small percentage of the population could still choose to remain unvaccinated due to personal choice, hesitancy or other reasons. “No other district in the country has managed to reach the 100% target in such a short time,” said Mumbai’s additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. “It has been a collective effort. We achieved it because of the sincere contribution of all municipal workers, private hospitals, NGOs and people on the ground.”Mumbai reached the 1 million doses (both doses included) mark on March 25. The 9 million doses landmark was attained on August 24. On September 4, Mumbai became the first district in India to administer 10 million doses, and on November 10, it crossed the 15 million mark. As of Saturday, Mumbai had administered 15,286,627 combined doses.According to Kakani, decentralising vaccination centres played a crucial role in achieving the target. As the city moves to increase its first dose coverage beyond 100% and achieve the second dose target, new micro strategies are being designed.Infectious disease expert and member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force Dr Om Srivastava said that 100% first dose coverage is “great news.” “It means the city is better protected than earlier. But we cannot let our guard down. The virus is unpredictable, and there are countries that are seeing large number of cases even now. France has announced it is experiencing a fifth wave,” he said.Also Read | Mumbai civic body official: Initial phase and last mile are the most challengingOn Friday, World Health Organisation (WHO) chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that Covid-19 cases were not only surging in eastern European countries with lower vaccination rates, but also in western Europe, which is among the world’s highest vaccinated geographies.Vaccination in Mumbai first began on January 16 along with the rest of the country for healthcare workers, which was expanded on February 5 to include frontline workers; on March 1 for citizens above 60 years of age; on April 1 for citizens in 45-59 years age group; and on May 1 for all adult citizens. Vaccination for lactating mothers began on May 26, and for pregnant women, it began from July 14.On day one, Mumbai had just 10 vaccinations centres, but that number has grown to 462, including public and private vaccination centres, with a combined capacity of administering over 123,000 doses per day.Dr Naveen Thacker, vaccination expert and a former civil society organisation representative to GAVI, the vaccine alliance, said, “Mumbai has shown 100% vaccination is achievable. Other districts in the country should follow suit.

14-11-2021||India||China expert Pradeep Rawat will be India’s new envoy to Beijing||China expert and former head of the East Asia division in the ministry of external affairs (MEA), Pradeep Kumar Rawat, an Indian Foreign Service (IFS) officer of the 1990 batch, is expected to take over as India’s new envoy to Beijing with the incumbent Vikram Misri returning to New Delhi as a secretary. Rawat is the envoy to the Netherlands since January 2021.Fluent in Mandarin Chinese, Rawat has spent the majority of his diplomatic career either in China or handling Beijing from Delhi and was the joint secretary (East Asia) from 2014 to 2017. He was posted to Indonesia as an ambassador from 2017 to 2020.Rawat’s posting comes at a time when India and China are facing serious friction all along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with the People's Liberation Army (PLA) ramping up military infrastructure and weaponry. The Indian Army and PLA are fully deployed along the 1597 km LAC in Ladakh after Beijing decided to unilaterally change the status quo on the north banks of Pangong Tso in May 2020. The Chinese aggression led to a clash in Galwan in June 2020 where the Indian Army lost 20 personnel, including Colonel Santosh Babu, but not before giving a reply in equal measure to the PLA.In Rawat’s appointment, the Modi government has put faith in a diplomat who has huge institutional memory on the bilateral relationship as Beijing is known to twist historical facts to suit its purpose. Pradeep Rawat, who has worked with now external affairs minister S Jaishankar as his East Asia division head when he was the foreign secretary, has handled all the bilateral mechanisms and is known for his calm and professional demeanour.Incumbent Vikram Misri returns to Delhi as the secretary in the MEA after a successful tenure in Beijing, where he handled the Ladakh crisis with equanimity. Misri, a 1989 batch IFS officer, will be able to provide his acquired expertise on China to the ministry as it will be quite sometime before the bilateral relations between the two countries get normalised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-expert-pradeep-rawat-will-be-india-s-new-envoy-to-beijing-101636862632086.html

The Prime Minister's Office (PMO) issued a notification in this regard earlier this week, stating, “more than ₹700 crore will be credited directly to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries on the occasion.”The scheme is an ambitious mission of the Modi government aimed at providing “housing for all”. It aims to achieve the housing objective as India completes 75 years of Independence by 2022.The definition of what qualifies as a “kaccha” house (having structures constructed of bamboo, clay, grass, flax, pebbles, mulch, crop residues, and the likes) has been changed specifically for a state, the PMO said, considering the unique geo-climatic condition of Tripura. This was done following the direct intervention of the Prime Minister, and it has enabled a large number of beneficiaries living in “kaccha” houses in the state to get assistance to construct a “pucca” house (consisting of strong structures made of wood, bricks, cement, iron rods, and steel).Last year, Tripura was adjudged the ‘best-performing state’ in the north-eastern region and hilly states category under the central government’s flagship Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) scheme. Now, the PMAY-G scheme aims to improve the lives of beneficiaries in the rural areas, too.The PMAY-G was created to provide pucca houses to every homeless poor in rural areas. The Centre’s performance audit this year had noted that Chhattisgarh, Assam, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu have huge gaps in pending sanctions and need to expedite the daily rate of sanctions to achieve the target.The audit added that “while the lockdown due to Covid-19 was largely an unavoidable factor”, intense follow-ups are being done with the states/UTs which are lagging behind.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-to-transfer-over-rs-700-crore-to-housing-scheme-beneficiaries-in-tripura-101636856412253.html

I have always wanted to donate to a poor family and decided to donate everything to Budha and his family who are living in a slum. Budha has done so much for me and my family over the last 25 years and I am really grateful to him. I wanted him to have a shelter of his own,” said Minati.Minati had lost her 70-year-old husband Krushna Kumar Patnaik, a businessman, last year when the latter developed a tumour which turned cancerous. Six months later, her 31-year-old daughter Komal Kumari was injured while lighting an oil lamp and had a cardiac arrest soon after. Disconsolate after the twin deaths, Minati lost her desire to live and skipped her meals when Budha made her lunch and dinner. From taking her to the hospital or looking after her needs, Budha and his family devoted themselves to serving the widow in every possible way.Minati said her family has always felt safe with the rickshaw puller since the last 25 years. “When my daughter was in school, Budha would take her and bring her back. My husband always trusted him. After my daughter’s death, neither my in-laws nor anyone from my parental family called me to inquire about my health or responded to my calls. It was for the last 25 years that Budha and his family stood by me. They have always given me respect and taken care of my family,” she said.The rickshaw-puller said that he was taken by surprise when Minati told him about her decision to will her property. “I had never dreamt of the property. But I always made it a point to ensure that my family always looked after Minati after her husband died. We will continue to look after her as long as she is alive,” said Budha, whose family includes his wife, three children, two sons and a daughter and his parents.In 2018, a 60-year-old businessman of Koraput district living in a rented home had donated over 2.3 acres of land among 250 landless people to fulfil his promise that he made to himself. Muguda Suryanarayan Achary, who ran a metal fabrication unit in Jeypore town of Koraput, became the talk of the town when it was revealed that he had been donating patches of land to destitute for over a decade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/63yearold-widow-in-odisha-s-cuttack-wills-her-house-jewellery-to-loyal-rickshawpuller-101636832870792.html
14-11-2021||India||Comedian Munawar Faruqui’s show in Goa cancelled after pressure from vigilantes||Comedian Munawar Faruqui, who is being hounded by right wing activists, saw yet another show, scheduled to be held in Panaji next week cancelled by the organisers after pressure from the Hindu Janjagriti Samiti which had called for cancellation of the show. Faruqui was scheduled to do a stand-up show at a mall in the state capital next week, but the organisers have announced that the show has been cancelled. The decision to cancel the show comes amid increasing discontent in the state over Chief Minister Pramod Sawant’s unwillingness to rein in right wing groups that is being seen as a sharp departure from his predecessor Manohar Parrikar, who had even banned Sri Rama Sene leader Pramod Muthalik from entering Goa, a ban that is in force to this day. The organisers LVF Comedy have confirmed that the show has been cancelled, but founder Warren Viegas declined to comment on the development.The agency’s decision to cancel the show, was taken after a meeting with officials at the Panaji police station on Saturday where the police told them they anticipated a law and order problem if the show was held. The Hindu Janjagriti Samiti had in a representation to the state alleged that Faruqui should not be allowed to go ahead with his show as he “has made vulgar jokes about Hindu gods”.“He has targeted them. He was behind bars for 37 days in Madhya Pradesh for insulting the Hindu religion,” Samiti spokesman Jayesh Thali said.“There are elections in Goa and such events could create acrimony in the state. If Pramod Muthalik can be banned in Goa, why is Munawar allowed in Goa,” he asked.Faruqui has seen several shows cancelled across the country under sustained pressure from self-styled vigilantes who have vowed not to allow him to perform anywhere in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/comedian-munawar-faruqui-s-show-in-goa-cancelled-after-pressure-from-vigilantes-101636830890986.html
14-11-2021||India||Congress looks to corner BJP over Karnataka bitcoin case||The Congress on Saturday alleged a multi-crore Bitcoin scam and its cover-up by the BJP government in Karnataka and demanded that an independent investigation be conducted into the matter by a Supreme Court-monitored SIT.Former party chief Rahul Gandhi alleged that the scam is big but the cover-up is much bigger.Taking to Twitter, he said, “Bitcoin Scam is big. But Bitcoin Scam Cover-up is much bigger. Because it has to cover up someone’s fake big ego.” Addressing a press conference, Congress general secretary and chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala posed a set of six questions to the prime minister and asked what was the role of Karnataka Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, who was the state’s home minister when the scam took place.He asked why international investigative agencies, including the Interpol, were not informed about the stolen Bitcoins.“India’s biggest ever ‘Bitcoin Scam’ has been unearthed in Karnataka. Instead of conducting a fair investigation, the BJP government of Karnataka appears to be preoccupied with ‘Operation Bitcoin Scam Coverup’,” he alleged.“This is not a money laundering crime alone, this is an international crime. Considering how shoddily and compromised the investigation has been done, I don’t think that the ED (Enforcement Directorate) or Karnataka Police can do a fair job. That is why we demand that an SIT (special investigation team) should be set up and monitored by the Supreme Court which should investigate this case and bring out the truth,” the Congress leader said.Surjewala also questioned the silence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the case and claimed that the prime minister was told by the FBI about it during his recent visit to the US.“It is a multi-country investigation and the truth must come out. The government is either colluding or is working shoddily in the investigation.... There are doubts being raised on the reputation of Basavaraj Bommai and his political career and reputation are at stake and that is why he should write to the government for constituting an SIT monitored by the SC to probe this,” he said.Surjewala, along with party spokesperson Gourav Vallabh, alleged that an alleged hacker, Sri Krishna, was arrested along with his associate Robin Khandelwal by the Karnataka Police on November 14 last year and was kept in police custody for over 100 days by repeatedly arresting him in at least five criminal cases registered one after the other. He was released on bail on April 17 this year.He alleged that Sri Krishna made a voluntary statement before the Metropolitan Magistrate, Bengaluru, sometime in December 2020, wherein he has allegedly given the names of various foreign companies/portals which were hacked by him, and millions of dollars earned illegally.The Congress leaders also alleged that Sri Krishna was involved in alleged hacking of Bitcoin/Cryptocurrency exchanges and websites that includes from Bitfinex, registered in noted tax haven, the British Virgin Islands and reports suggest that it was hacked on August 2, 2016 and 1,20,000 bitcoins were stolen. However, in his voluntary statement, he admits to having taken 2000 Bitcoins.He said ‘Whale Alert’ is a Twitter account which tracks large scale cryptocurrency transactions and it reflects that on December 1, 2020, and on April 14, 2021, Bitcoins from the 2016 hack of Bitfinex Bitcoin exchange were transferred and its value comes out to be USD 704.8 million USD (equivalent to ₹5,240 crore).“Despite multiple international crimes of significant magnitude, Interpol was not informed for over five months. Only on April 24, 2021, more than five months after the initial arrest, did the Commissioner of Police, Bengaluru wrote to Interpol Liaison Officer (CBI) asking to inform Interpol and other agencies. Even ED/CBI/SFIO were not informed by the Karnataka’s BJP government,” Surjewala said, adding that Bommai was the state’s home minister between August 20, 2019, to July 28, 2021.“Should the then Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai be punished for not taking action in the case,” he asked, alleging that the fraud happened under his watch and when the accused was kept in custody.“Who are the actors in the “Bitcoin Coverup Scam”? Were the stolen bitcoins transferred from the wallet of alleged hacker Sri Krishna? How many bitcoins and of what value? How does the Bengaluru police then suggest (in its third Panchnama dated 22nd January 2021) that the 31 and 186 Bitcoins allegedly transferred to police wallet were lost or were found to be fake transactions,” he asked.He also asked what was the role and responsibility of Bommai and others in the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-looks-to-corner-bjp-over-karnataka-bitcoin-case-101636829573324.html
14-11-2021||India||PM Modi chairs meet on cryptocurrency amid concerns over terror financing||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday chaired a meeting on the way forward for cryptocurrency amid growing concerns over its use for money-laundering and terror financing.According to two persons familiar with the matter, at the meeting, there was a consensus that the government should not make any private digital currency, as legal tender and unregulated cryptocurrencies have exposed gullible Indians to financial risks.“While the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is open to using the technology behind cryptocurrencies, it is not in favour of making them legal tender as these currencies are highly volatile and a threat to the financial stability. Most of the government departments concur with RBI, but they are under pressure from various lobby groups who want a status quo. A final view will, however, be taken by the top leadership,” one of the persons cited above said on condition of anonymity.The crucial meeting comes two days after RBI governor Shaktikanta Das sounded alarm on cryptocurrencies, cautioning investors on the potential pitfalls of the digital currencies.The central bank has repeatedly reiterated its strong views against cryptocurrencies, saying they pose serious threats to the macroeconomic and financial stability of the country and also doubted the number of investors trading on them as well as their claimed market value.The currency is, however, not legally banned and the government is in the process of enacting a law in this regard.In March this year, then Union minister of state for finance Anurag Thakur had said that the government would be extra careful while taking any decision regarding cryptocurrencies as they are highly volatile and could have security implications. The government, however, could embrace the blockchain technology of virtual currencies, he added.Last year, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had told the Rajya Sabha that the government did not consider cryptocurrencies as a legal tender. Quoting from the Budget speech for 2018-19, she said: “The government does not consider crypto-currencies legal tender or coin and will take all measures to eliminate use of these crypto-assets in financing illegitimate activities or as part of the payment system. The government will explore the use of block chain technology for ushering in the digital economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-chairs-meeting-on-cryptocurrency-amid-concerns-of-terror-financing-money-laundering-101636829330687.html
14-11-2021||India||Bhopal’s Habibganj station renamed after tribal queen||The revamped Habibganj railway station in Bhopal has been renamed after Gond queen Rani Kamlapati, Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan announced on Saturday, while thanking Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the decision. The Prime Minister is scheduled to inaugurate this renamed railway station, redeveloped with modern airport-like amenities, on November 15, during his visit to the state capital. The station was revamped at a cost of ₹450 crore under Public Private Partnership mode in three years. Hailing Rani Kamlapati as the pride of the Gond community, Chouhan, in a statement, said: “Rani Kamlapati is the pride of the Gond community and the last Hindu queen of Bhopal. Her kingdom was usurped by Afghan commander Dost Mohammed by deceit under a conspiracy. When she saw that victory was not possible, she committed ‘Jal Jauhar’ (a practice of committing suicide) to save her respect.” The chief minister added that Rani Kamlapati’s son Naval Shah had been killed at Lalghati, a part of Bhopal. On Friday, the state government had written to the Ministry of Home Affairs about renaming the station, stating that it will honour the legacy and bravery of the widow of the Gond ruler of Nizam Shah. Following the Centre’s decision, a gazette notification was issued in this regard on Saturday.“She was the last Hindu queen of Bhopal. Habibganj railway station has been named ‘Rani Kamlapati’ after her. It is a matter of great satisfaction and joy for me. Prime minister shri Narendra Modi I thank you from my heart,” the chief minister later tweeted. The Gond community comprises the largest tribal group of India with more than 1.2 crore population.The Centre’s move evoked a mixed response. While the tribal community objected to the “distorted” facts about the queen, a few experts claimed Rani Kamlapati had not done anything for Bhopal.“Habibganj railway station was located in a village which was named after Habibullah, grandson of Nawab Sultan Jehan Begum. After the death of his father Nasirullah Khan, Habibullah was about to become a ruler of Bhopal but Sultan Jehan Begum interfered and ensured the rule for his youngest son Hamidullah Khan in 1926. Later, Habibullah left Bhopal. He remained a bachelor and died in Pune,” Ashar Kidwai, history professor at Safia Arts College in the city, said.“It is true that Habibullah did not do much for the city, so his name can be changed, but like Habibullah, Rani Kamlapati had also not done anything for the development of the city. It should be named after any member of the Nawab’s family or in the name of Barkatullah, a great freedom fighter from Bhopal. The Bharatiya Janata Party has tried to push the agenda of impressing the tribals and calling them Hindu by doing this,” Rizwan Uddin Ansari, a historian from Bhopal, said.The tribals were upset for referring to Rani Kamlapati as a “Hindu queen”. “Rani Kamlapati’s real name was Rani Kamlavati Pallam. The Gond kingdom was spread from Mandla to Bhopal. A queen of Gond Johnson from Jabalpur, Rani Durgavati was a glorious queen of the kingdom for fighting fiercely with the Mughals. Rani Kamlapati, who was a wife of Nizam Shah, was the last queen of the Gond Kingdom but she was not a Hindu queen,” Devraven Bhalavi, an activist who works for the community, said. “In our constitution, the tribal community has a separate identity but the BJP is not missing any chance to call them a Hindu. We believe in the Constitution and the BJP is following its own constitution. Their intention is very clear, to woo tribals and later, declare them as a Hindu,” Vibhuti Jha, an expert in history of the tribal community, said. The opposition Congress also sought to know the reason behind the need to rename the station.“Habibullah Khan gave land and also money for the construction of a small railway station in the 1920’s. Later in 1969, the state government constructed it as a second railway station in the city after Bhopal railway station in the name of Habibullah only. They are unnecessarily changing the name to end the identity of Nawab’s family, who developed it beautifully,” Congress MLA from Bhopal, Arif Masood, said. BJP MP from Bhopal, Pragya Thakur, who wanted the station to be renamed after former prime minister late Atal Bihar Vajpayee, also welcomed the decision. “It is a matter of pride for us that the railway station will be named after the last Hindu Gond queen of Bhopal. I am happy that our demand to change the name has been accepted by the central government,” BJP MP from Bhopal, Pragya Thakur, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bhopals-habibganj-station-renamed-after-tribal-queen-101636829150509.html

No one has ever made such large numbers of fake promises as this government has done.”“The SP will win over 400 seats in Uttar Pradesh. Inflation and unemployment have increased. The public has made up its mind for the elimination of the BJP,” he said, adding that the change will start from Gorakhpur.Attacking the ruling party in the state over its “failure” to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic, the former chief minister said: “Do you remember how our labourers walked on foot to home in huge numbers from various parts of the country, including Gujarat and Maharashtra? However, this government did nothing for them.”“Back then, the poor desperately needed hospitals, medicines and oxygen but the government failed to supply them, leading to uncountable deaths,” he added. Targeting the Centre over rising fuel prices, he said: “The BJP leaders had promised that common people can travel by air. But the people owning two-wheelers are also upsetReacting to the SP leader’s claims, BJP (Gorakhpur) spokesperson Satendra Sinha said: “People had rejected the SP in 2019 and then in 2017 and this time too they will be rejected by voters. The BJP is confident of winning again.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/upelections-akhilesh-yadav-takes-on-cm-yogi-from-his-turf-in-gorakhpur-101636829035481.html

One is the recovery from Covid and the other is the recovery of the economy. Both are showing resilience in different forms. In terms of lives and livelihoods,” a statement of Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) said, quoting him. Ficci is one of the partners in the India Pavilion.Jaishankar said there is every sign that the economy is faring well. “The growth is not only back in numbers seen in company reporting, but also on the streets in terms of spirit. I would say we are well-poised and part of the reason why we are well poised is that a lot of effort was made in creating the capacities to handle Covid — hospitals, ventilators and even the vaccination. Part of it is also because of the resilience and foresight with which we responded,” he said.“We husbanded our resources well and reacted in the balanced and right manner. We recovered and at the same time we recovered in a very responsible manner. So, that creates a fair degree of confidence and optimism in India as we look into 2022,” he said.The minister said India’s trade recovery with its partners such as the UAE is robust. “Trade recovery has been very strong and we don’t think that it is just because of pent up demand. The recovery remains very strong,” he said. Jaishankar also visited the UAE and Israeli pavilions.Commenting on achieving 300,000 footfall at the Indian pavilion, he said: “In many ways, the Indian pavilion covers the tradition and the modernity of the country. It is challenging but that has been successfully done. The footfalls are reflective of the good work that has been done.” Ambassador of India to the UAE, Pavan Kapoor, and Consul General of India in Dubai Aman Puri were also present at the occasion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dubai-expo-both-covid-recovery-economy-showing-resilience-says-jaishankar-101636828614629.html

14-11-2021||India||‘Good quality legal aid possible only if senior lawyers join outreach drive’: SC judge justice Uday U Lalit||The National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) has been in a power-drive mode ever since justice Uday U Lalit took over as its executive chairperson in June this year. New records were made in disposal of cases in Lok Adalats as the Supreme Court judge infused renewed vigour and use of technological tools to facilitate settlement of cases without overstretched trials. Justice Lalit has a vision – to make access to justice not just a slogan but a reality for the person living in the remotest part of the country. In his interview to Hindi Hindustan’s Shashi Shekhar and Shyam Suman, the judge, who is in line to become the Chief Justice of India in August 2022, highlights the achievements of NALSA and the need to spread awareness, besides improving the quality of legal aid.How difficult was it to initiate the work as NALSA’s chairperson during the Covid-19 pandemic?It was virtually impossible to have physical interactions with officials of NALSA during the pandemic. Therefore, I immediately started having day-long interactive sessions with chairpersons of state-level services authorities and committees virtually to come to a common platform on areas that we needed to focus on. Following several rounds of deliberation, we were able to devise what is called a common module after identifying the major challenges before us.What emerged as chief areas of concern for NALSA that was set up to ensure fair and meaningful justice to the marginalised and disadvantaged sector?There were three or four issues that we could zero in on. First, we found out that legal aid in criminal cases constituted just about 1% of total cases. At a pre-arrest stage, legal aid cases constituted not even 1% of the total 1%. Therefore, the entire apparatus of legal aid seems to come to the rescue of a man only after his arrest. Why? We realised that awareness is something which is terribly lacking. We then took several measures. We got in touch with the Union ministry of home affairs to see that all first information reports (FIRs) give information that every suspect or accused is entitled to free legal aid, which can be secured through legal aid services clinics, etc. The MHA agreed and such instructions were issued to the home departments of all the states. FIRs now have such endorsements for awareness of those fearing arrests or arrested. We also said that all police stations should display information about free legal aid and the MHA has agreed to this.To spread awareness in rural areas, we had meetings with the department of post and telegraph and they have also agreed that every post office will display such information. Magistrates have also been asked to ensure that all those being produced before them in custody are provided legal aid before their cases are taken up. We are also ensuring those in jails get legal aid to move appropriate petitions and applications before courts. When I visited Cherlapally prison in Hyderabad, I saw inmates getting psychological help to ensure mental well-being. We also sent NALSA director Puneet Sehgal to Bulandshahr prison in Uttar Pradesh in July to collect inputs about capacity of prisons and prison management systems so that we can bring about necessary reforms for the inmates.Are there any special programmes for awareness and assistance to women and children?This is an area that has drawn our serious attention. We need to have para legal volunteers who can help women in the rural setups to raise their voice against domestic violence so that adequate legal aid can be provided. For children, we are focussing on providing them good quality education as enforcement of their constitutional right to education. For juveniles who are in conflict with law, we are going to focus on continuation of their education, besides access to rights as per the law. We are also mulling programmes for children with special needs in order to see that there is an inclusive setup.How has the endeavour to spread awareness worked so far?Spreading awareness is the most important step. In July this year, we had to organise the first Lok Adalat after I took over. During discussion, it was agreed that before the cases are considered in Lok Adalats, litigants and parties should be contacted so that they come prepared with terms of amicable settlements and the disputes can be laid to rest in just one sitting. We could, thus, settle 2.9 million cases in Lok Adalats held in July. This was as against the previous highest of 1.4 million cases. We utilised the virtual platform and technological tools to our advantage. While we initially thought that disposal of 2.9 million cases in July could be a result of the backlog of the Covid period, we were pleasantly surprised when we disposed of more than 4.2 million cases in the Lok Adalats that were held in September.What are your views on the quality of legal aid?There must be good quality legal aid. And good quality legal aid will be ensured only if senior advocates and established lawyers become part of the legal outreach programmes. People don’t come for legal aid because they are not assured of good quality assistance. If good seniors get associated, it will always ensure that. If a lawyer’s ability does not inspire confidence in a litigant, then however strong your outreach programmes are, they are not going to fructify in actual rendering of legal aid in court-based litigation. Some high courts call for records in cases where lawyers appeared as pro bono when they are considered for being designated as senior advocates. That kind of emphasis must be everywhere. We are also working on a module where a senior lawyer and a junior lawyer can be bracketed together in certain kinds of cases for a more effective representation.Has NALSA been able to reach every nook and corner of the country?As part of this programme, today, every village has been covered by our legal services authority. I have visited 13 states personally. I visited Ladakh in the north, Kanyakumari in the south, Kutch in the western front and Agartala and Mizoram on the eastern front. I must congratulate all persons who are part of the legal services. To commemorate 75 years of Independence of our country, NALSA devised a six-week long pan-Indian legal awareness and outreach campaign. In the last three phases, between October 2 and November 7, we have visited more than 1.5 million villages through door-to-door visits, interacting with around 630 million people and organising 464,000 legal awareness programmes. This programme culminates on November 14. We will galvanise all our resources and manpower in action and will reach every nook and corner by then.In a country as vast as ours, how do you see law colleges and students playing a role in the legal outreach programmes?In medical colleges, we have internship programmes that contemplate giving back to society whatever you have learnt. But there is no such internship in law colleges. Rather than making it compulsory, we got in touch with the Bar Council of India (BCI) with an idea that every law college adopt three talukas in the vicinity and send their law students as participants in the legal outreach programmes. Budding lawyers’ horizons are ever-expanding. If you indoctrinate law students, when they become lawyers, they are the surest sort of crop for you to induct in your legal aid service clinics.

On Saturday, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal convened an emergency meeting hours after the Supreme Court suggested that the Centre and the Delhi government consider imposing a lockdown for two days in view of the hazardous pollution levels in the national capital. Kejriwal said there will be no immediate lockdown.“We are not imposing a lockdown in Delhi now. It is an extreme step, and for pollution such a measure has not been taken in the city so far. We will be preparing a proposal after thorough consultations with all stakeholders... Once ready, we will submit the proposal to the Supreme Court,” Kejriwal told reporters after the meeting.Senior officials in the Delhi government said the proposal will delve into aspects such as banning all private vehicles and shutting industries, among other things. “Private offices will also be mandated to work from home in that case. But, just as the chief minister said, nothing can be decided without consultations with the L-G and the central government,” one of the officials said on condition of anonymity.New measures that will kick in from Monday include closure of physical classes in all schools, colleges and educational institutions for a week. All Delhi government offices, agencies and companies will also shift to complete work from home mode for a week starting Monday.“Schools will be shut so that children do not have to breathe polluted air by stepping out. Virtual classes will continue. Also, the entire Delhi government will shift to WFH for a week as well,” Kejriwal said.For private offices, the Delhi government will issue an advisory urging them to promote WFH as far as possible. However, senior government officials on condition of anonymity said the advisory will not be binding on any private office, unless a lockdown is imposed at a later stage.The government also imposed a blanket ban on all construction activities till November 17 (Wednesday), until further orders. “As per weather reports, there will be no wind to disperse pollutants in the air between November 14-17 and smoke from stubble burning in the neighbouring states will continue to come. It looks like the situation during these day could worsen. So, during this time, all construction activities will be shut,” the chief minister said.Delhi’s air quality saw only a minor improvement on Saturday. CPCB recordings showed that the overall air quality index of Delhi was 437. While this was a marginal improvement from Friday’s 471, which was the highest recording for the season, this was the third consecutive day that the Capital’s air remained in the dangerous zone, posing severe health risks to residents.Scientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) warned that while Saturday’s improvement in air quality was a result of slight improvement in wind speeds and reduction in moisture levels in the atmosphere, this relief is only temporary. From November 14, winds will start slowing down again and remain so till November 17.“The winds picked up today (Saturday) and by afternoon reached around 12kmph. This helped clear out the haze a little. The impact of these winds will be seen till Sunday morning but after that wind speeds will reduce again and pollution levels will start rising,” said VK Soni, head of the IMD’s environment and research centre.Kejriwal said pollution levels in Delhi were satisfactory till September 30. “But the air quality started deteriorating due to stubble burning from neighbouring states. This is not the time to play a blame game. The Centre will do what it needs to and the same goes for other states,” he said.Based on IMD’s forecast, the sub-committee of the Commission for Air Quality Management in Delhi-NCR and adjoining areas (CAQM) for the implementation of Grap conducted a meeting on Saturday but no additional measures were suggested. The sub-committee, however, has asked government agencies to “be prepared” to implement emergency measures listed under Grap “in short notice” looking at the unfavourable weather forecast. The minutes of the meeting also indicated that if pollution worsens some additional measures that will be “deemed necessary” to control the rising levels will also be put in place.School administrators in Delhi said they will comply with the government orders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/inaction-on-farm-fires-slow-grap-keep-toxic-haze-hanging-101636828129784.html
14-11-2021||India||Freedom fighter grandfather inspired deceased Colonel Tripathi to join army||Colonel Viplav Tripathi, who was martyred in an ambush set by militants in Manipur on Saturday, was inspired by his freedom fighter grand-father who was also a member of the Constituent Assembly.Kishori Mohan Tripathi died in 1994 when Viplav was 14. It was his grand-father who inspired Viplav to don the army uniform, his maternal uncle (`mama') Rajesh Patnaik told PTI here.Colonel Tripathi, the Commanding Officer of Khuga Battalion of Assam Rifles, his wife Anuja (36) and son Abir (5) besides four personnel of the paramilitary force were killed in an ambush by militants in the north-eastern state.The Tripathi family hails from Raigarh in Chhattisgarh.“Viplav joined the Indian Army with the goal of serving the nation, taking inspiration from his grandfather, a great freedom fighter. His father, a senior journalist, and his mother, a social activist, also encouraged him. He has sacrificed his life while serving for the country. We are proud of him,” Patnaik said.Viplav was attached to Kishori Mohan, and had even visited the Rashtrapati Bhavan with him when Giani Zail Singh was President, he said.Born on May 30, 1980, Viplav went to the Sainik School Rewa (Madhya Pradesh) after passing class V at a school in Raigarh town. His father, Subhash Tripathi (76) is a senior journalist and editor of the local Hindi daily 'Dainik Bayar' and mother Asha Tripathi is a retired librarian.After schooling, Viplav got admission to the National Defence Academy (NDA), Khadakwasla and then joined the Indian Military Academy (IMA), Dehradun, Patnaik said.In 2001, he was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Kumaon Regiment in Ranikhet. He later passed a command course from the Defence Service Staff College (DSSC) Wellington.Viplav's younger brother Anay Tripathi, who also studied at the Sainik School Rewa, is also an army officer, now posted as lieutenant colonel in Shillong, Patnaik said."Anay, who had arrived in Raigarh on Friday night, got the shocking news about his brother through his army colleagues around 12:30 pm today," an inconsolable Patnaik said.“The entire family had celebrated Diwali this year in Manipur, where Viplav was posted. His parents returned to Raigarh on November 6," he said.Anay has left for the Eastern Command headquarters of the army in Kolkata, and mortal remains of Viplav, his wife and son would be brought to Raigarh on Sunday, Patnaik said.A pall of gloom descended on Raigarh town when the news reached, with locals rushing to his house to express their condolences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/freedom-fighter-grandfather-inspired-deceased-colonel-tripathi-to-join-army-101636827873378.html
14-11-2021||India||Policemen gun down 26 Maoists in Maharashtra||At least 26 Maoists were killed in an encounter with security forces in the dense forests of Maharashtra’s Gadchiroli district, officials said on Saturday evening, in one of the deadliest counter-insurgency operations in the region since 2018 when 42 Maoists were killed in two encounters.People aware of the developments said that four police officials were seriously injured in the gunbattle that lasted for about 10 hours, and were airlifted to Orange City Hospital in Nagpur for treatment.The major offensive came after specific intelligence about the movement of the Maoists from Chhattisgarh to the forests of Mardintola and Kotgul, under the Gyarapatti police station, for a meeting, the officials said.The site of the encounter is over 900km away from Mumbai and borders Chhattisgarh.A special police party with jawans of the C-60 force, an elite anti-Maoist squad of the district police, led by additional superintendent of police Soumya Munde, raided the Maoist hideouts at around 6am, the officials said.“Police had received secret information that there was a camp of Naxalites in the Gyarapatti-Kodagul forest of Korchi, on the basis of this, the C-60 unit of Gadchiroli Police started the search operation in Gyarapatti-Kodagul forest from 6am on Saturday morning,” Gadchiroli superintendent of police Ankit Goyal told news agency ANI.During the raids, the left-wing extremists started firing at the security forces that retaliated the gun fire, the official said. The encounter continued till 4.30pm, he said. A special combat force of the district police was sent to the forest to aid the security efforts, Goyal said.“We have recovered the bodies of 26 Naxals so far from the forest,” Goyal said, adding that toll may increase as a search operation in the area is still going on, amid sporadic gunfire. The slain Maoists include women commanders, the official said. The bodies of the slain Maoists will be brought to Gadchiroli for post-mortem examination, Goyal said.Officials believe that the heavy casualties suffered in the encounter will have disastrous impacts on the Maoist movement. Gadchiroli is one of the dozens of Maoist hotbeds dotting central and eastern India.“Gadhchiroli, after being developed into a strong zone, became the pivotal point in the Maoist dominated areas particularly in Bastar, enabling supply of logistics, medicines and medical treatment to the cadres, “ a senior Chhattisgarh Police official said. Over the past few years, the extremists have attempted an expansion into the MMC zone (Maharashtra-Madhya Pradesh-Chhattisgarh confluence) -- a new area adjoining the Kanha reserve that they are seeking to enter.Gadhchiroli also offered a safe passage for cadres and senior leaders of the outfit’s central committee to travel to MMC zone. “The gradual decimation of Maoists in Gadchiroli will have disastrous impact on growth of Maoists in MMC region. Maoists in Bastar will be isolated with pressure across Gadchiroli, Telangana, AP and Odisha,” another official in Chhattisgarh said. While the identities of the Maoists are yet to be ascertained, people familiar with the matter said that many senior members of the Communist Party of India (Maoist) were killed in the operation.Milind Teltumbde, a central committee member, who was once the secretary of the Maharashtra unit of the CPI (Maoist), is suspected to have been one of the targets in the encounter, the people cited above said.Maharashtra home minister Dilip Walse-Patil told PTI that the police were verifying if Teltumbde was among the slain rebels. Teltumbde, along with his brother, Anand Teltumbde, a Dalit ideologue, is an accused in the Bhima-Koregaon violence case. “We will be able to provide all the details tomorrow after the identification,” Goyal said.A police official in Chhattisgarh said Teltumbde was tasked with the consolidation of the MMC zone.“After the identification of MMC zone, Milind Teltumbde was appointed as the head of the zone and Gadhchiroli division was tasked to oversee the expansion and consolidation of the MMC zone”, the official said.The police have recovered a huge cache of arms and ammunition, and Maoist literature from the encounter site, Goyal said.Saturday’s encounter is the one of biggest operations since 2018, when around 42 cadres of the Maoists were killed in two separate encounters with the Gadchiroli police in Rela-Kasnasur and Nainer forests on April 22 and 23, 2018.Srikant alias Srinu, the in-charge of the south Gadchiroli division of the CPI(M), and Dolesh Madhi Atram alias Sainath, were among those killed in the twin encounters.The encounter has dealt a blow to the extremist forces. Bose, alias Kishan Da, was arrested along with his wife Sheela Marandi, a central committee member of the banned outfit. According to official records, 43 CPI(M) members gave up arms in Gadchiroli between 2019 and 2021.Apart from this, Maoists of the Dandakaranya Zonal Committee have claimed that 96 members of the outfit died between July 2020 and July 2021. Of these, they said, 27 were women cadres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/policemen-gun-down-26-maoists-in-maharashtra-101636828070478.html
14-11-2021||India||Colonel, wife, 8-yr-old son among 7 killed in Manipur||Armed militants on Saturday ambushed an Assam Rifles convoy near the porous India-Myanmar border in Manipur’s Churachandpur district, killing five soldiers including a colonel, his wife, their eight-year-old son, and injuring six personnel of whom four are critical and battling for their lives at a medical facility in the state, people familiar with the developments said.The commanding officer of the 46 Assam Rifles, Colonel Viplav Tripathi, and his quick reaction team (QRT) were returning from the Behiang border post and heading to the battalion headquarters at Khuga when the militants ambushed them at S Sehken village under Singhat sub-division at around 11am, said one of the officials cited above. Apart from Tripathi, his wife Anuja and son Abeer; Riflemen NK Nayak, Suman Swargiary, RP Meena and Shyamal Das were killed in the planned attack. Family members of soldiers being hit by insurgents is a rarity and has sent shock waves through the military community.In May 2002, terrorists killed 31 people at an army base in Jammu and Kashmir’s Kaluchak area, including three soldiers and 18 family members (the youngest a two-month-old girl).The attackers first triggered an improvised explosive device (IED) on the single-lane road in a densely forested area and then brought the Assam Rifles personnel under heavy automatic fire to inflict maximum casualties, bringing back memories of the June 2015 Chandel ambush in the state in which a Dogra battalion of the Indian Army lost 18 men, said a second official. Five days after the Dogra unit was attacked in broad daylight in the Moltuk Valley, India’s Special Forces responded with a cross-border raid into Myanmar where they targeted and destroyed two insurgent camps.The Revolutionary People’s Front (RPF), a group under which PLA Manipur operates, on Saturday night claimed responsibility for the ambush, but said it wasn’t aware of the presence of family members in the convoy. The RPF statement added that family members should not be moving around in a disturbed area.“These insurgent outfits do not normally target women and children… The latest attack is an attempt by insurgents to establish their relevance at a time when violent incidents have reduced significantly in Manipur. A nudge by China cannot be ruled out,” said lieutenant general Konsam Himalay Singh, who retired in 2017 and is the first army officer from the Northeast to reach the three-star rank. The RPF statement was in Manipuri, and General Singh interpreted it for HT.Security forces on Saturday launched a manhunt for the insurgents but they may have slipped across the porous border into Myanmar, officials said.Tripathi’s unit, 46 Assam Rifles, had disrupted several drug trafficking rings in the area and may have been targeted by the insurgents because of its successes in curbing the illegal money-spinning trade, HT has learnt. The aftershocks of the hit were felt in New Delhi, with the government vowing strong action against the insurgents.Prime Minister Narendra Modi condemned the attack. “Their sacrifice will never be forgotten. My thoughts are with the bereaved families in this hour of sadness,” the Prime Minister wrote on Twitter.Defence minister Rajnath Singh said the perpetrators of the attack would be brought to justice swiftly. “The cowardly attack on an Assam Rifles convoy is extremely painful and condemnable. The nation has lost five brave soldiers including CO 46 AR and two family members. My condolences to the bereaved families,” Singh said.State chief minister N Biren Singh said security forces had launched a hunt for the militants and would be brought to justice.The security establishment had earlier suspected that the People’s Liberation Army of Manipur carried out the attack.At least half a dozen main insurgent groups are active in the state including PLA, People’s Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak (PREPAK), Kanglei Yawol Kanna Lup, Kangleipak Communist Party, Kuki National Army and Kuki National Front.“Insurgents may have carried out the attack to impose caution on the Assam Rifles as this unit was extremely successful in busting drug-trafficking networks in the area. These insurgent groups are involved in illegal narcotics trade,” said Lieutenant General Shokin Chauhan (retd), who headed the Assam Rifles in 2017-18.The road on which the ambush took place is one of the alternative routes from Myanmar to Imphal, and is used for drug trafficking.Like General Singh, Chauhan also didn’t rule out a Chinese angle to the attack. “The People’s Liberation Army of Manipur is known to be in sync with China. It is within the realm of possibility that it was ordered to carry out the hit to force India to deploy more forces in the area at a time when there’s tension along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China,” he said.He added that the attackers would have known that civilians were part of the Assam Rifles convoy but still carried out the daytime hit. (HT spoke to Chauhan before RPF issued the statement.)According to figures obtained by HT in 2018, the average annual operations launched by the army and Assam Rifles in Manipur involve setting up 52,000 check posts, 42,000 patrols, over 10,000 ambushes and 550 special operations.IEDs are one of the biggest challenges confronting soldiers deployed in insurgency-hit Manipur and mitigating that threat is a top priority for the security forces. The weapon has killed, maimed or injured hundreds of soldiers in the north-east over the last three decades.The vast area that the security forces operate in, the state’s topography and a 398km porous border with Myanmar are among the challenges faced by soldiers who operate from 180 bases scattered across Manipur, officials said.The latest ambush comes at a time when the security situation in the North-east had improved significantly in the army’s assessment, and a planned and gradual drawdown of soldiers is underway there.In February 2021, army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane said two army divisions had been pulled out of counter-insurgency and internal security duties in the Northeast, and were solely focused on their operational role along the China border.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/colonel-wife-8-yr-old-son-among-7-killed-in-manipur-101636828069758.html
14-11-2021||India||Gadchiroli op may deter Maoist expansion plans||Gadchiroli, located on the eastern border of Maharashtra, holds key logistical importance for the guerilla Maoist movement as its forests and hilly terrain provide a safe route for the cadre and transportation of resources. Saturday’s security operation, in which 26 Maoists, including possibly some of their key leaders, were killed, was likely to provide forces an edge in the area, officials said.The major offensive came after specific intelligence about the movement of the Maoists from Chhattisgarh to the forests of Mardintola and Kotgul, under the Gyarapatti police station, for a meeting, the officials said.The site of the encounter is over 900km away from Mumbai and borders Chhattisgarh.According to officials familiar with the matter, over the past few years, the extremists have been attempting an expansion into the MMC zone (Maharashtra-Madhya Pradesh-Chhattisgarh confluence) — a new area adjoining the Kanha reserve that they are seeking to enter.  “After the identification of MMC zone, Milind Baburao Teltumbde alias Deepak Teltumbde was appointed as the head of the zone and Gadchiroli division was tasked to oversee the expansion and consolidation of the MMC zone,” the official added.Gadchiroli is one of the dozens of Maoist hotbeds in the country.“Gadhchiroli, after being developed into a strong zone, became the pivotal point in the Maoist dominated areas particularly in Bastar, enabling supply of logistics, medicines and medical treatment to the cadres,” a senior Chhattisgarh Police official said.In May 2019, at least 15 security personnel and a civilian were killed in an IED explosion triggered by Maoists in the area.The area also offered a safe passage for Maoist cadres and senior leaders of the outfit’s central committee to travel to MMC zone. “The gradual decimation of Maoists in Gadchiroli will have disastrous impact on growth of Maoists in MMC region.

The minor girl later told her mother about the assault, it added.On November 6, the minor consumed poison and was rushed to a local hospital. She was later referred to Govind Ballabh Pant hospital where she succumbed to her injuries.“We registered a case based on the complaint. The delay happened due to post-crematorium rituals of the deceased. We have started our investigation,” said a police official of Kamalpur Police Station, who refused to be named. The accused is currently absconding, the official added.A member of the district Child Line said that they met the victim’s parents.“ We are waiting for reply from the Child Welfare Committee on the issue.

Police said the 17-year-old also named two other people, including the main accused’s wife — a teacher at the same school— in her suicide note.“The sexual assault happened between March and May this year. Two months later, the victim shared her ordeal with one of her friends and they informed the principal. The wife of the accused also knew about the alleged assault,” Coimbatore police commissioner Deepak Damor said.According to police, the accused Mithun Chakraborthy asked the student to come to school when classes were being held online on the pretext of conducting special classes and assaulted her within the institute’s premises. The victim’s mother told the police that they shifted her to a different school in September after she repeatedly asked them to do so, officials said. The teenager, however, did not specify why she wanted to be moved to a different school, the police quoted her mother as saying.The accused also resigned from the school in September but continued to harass the girl, police said. A case has been registered against Chakravarthy under IPC Section 306 (abetment of suicide) and relevant sections of the POCSO Act.Chief minister MK Stalin expressed grief over the student’s death and promised stringent action against the culprits. He said the act of “some human beasts” has taken away a life.“Schools should ensure sexual assaults do not happen.

14-11-2021||Today's||Recognising the role of tribal communities in Indian Independence||The government has declared November 15 as Janajatiya Gaurav Divas, to honour the contribution of the tribal community to the nation. It also happens to be the birth anniversary of the great tribal leader, Birsa Munda, whose role in the freedom struggle changed the course of modern India’s history. He mobilised the tribal community against the British, forcing them to introduce laws protecting the land rights of tribals. In his all-too-short life — he died in Ranchi jail at the age of 25 — he brought about seminal changes in the lives of tribals across the country.Week-long celebrations will begin today to mark the memory of the great unsung tribal heroes who sacrificed their lives for the country; without them, the commemoration of 75 years of Independence this year would not be complete.It was well before the freedom struggle of 1857 that the Janjatis and their leaders rose in revolt against the colonial forces. Across India, tribals ranging from the Santhals, Kol, Ho, Pahadia, Munda, Oraon, Chero, Lepcha, Bhutia, and the Bhuyan tribes in the east, the Khasi, Naga, Ahom, Meamaria, Abor, Nyishi, Jaintia, Garo, Mizo, Singhpo, Kuki and Lushai in the Northeast, the Padyagars, Kurichya, Beda, Gonds and Great Andamanese in the south, the Halba, Kol, Muriya, Koi in central India and the Dang Bhil, Mair, Naika, Koli, Mina and Dubla in the west, kept up sustained and ferocious attacks on the British.India is unique in that it has more than 700 tribal communities. These communities have enriched the country’s cultural heritage, through their exquisite art and craft. They have played a leading role in the promotion, protection and conservation of the environment through their traditional practices; with their vast repository of traditional knowledge, they have been the torch-bearers of sustainable development. Recognising the importance of tribals and their role in nation-building, the Constitution made special provisions for the protection of tribal culture and the development of Scheduled Tribes.The entire forest ecosystem, including water bodies, is the mainstay of the tribal economy. The British disrupted this and created a class of zamindars (landlords) and gave them rights over land in tribal territories. This reduced the tribals to mere tenants in their own lands. This exploitation fuelled the resentment which led to violent eruptions in the tribal revolutionary movements.These movements threw up inspirational leaders. Among them were Tilka Majhi, Tikendrajit Singh, Veer Surendra Sai, Telanga Kharia, Veer Narayan Singh, Sidhu, Kanu Murmu, Rupchand Konwar and Laxman Naik. One of the most charismatic was Birsa Munda, from the Munda community in present-day Jharkhand. He organised and led the tribal movement, giving a call for Ulgulan (revolt) to the tribals. The young Birsa also wanted to reform tribal society and urged it to shun superstition and witchcraft. Such was his charisma that tribal communities referred to him as “Bhagwan”.Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi has always acknowledged the invaluable contributions of the tribal communities to the freedom struggle. This is why, in his Independence Day Speech on August 15, 2016, he spoke of building dedicated museums in various parts of the country in memory of tribal freedom fighters. The ministry of tribal affairs is constructing these in collaboration with various state governments. The first museum to be completed is the Birsa Munda Freedom Fighter Museum at Ranchi which will be inaugurated by the PM on Monday.We cannot also forget the contributions of tribal women to the freedom movement. The names Rani Gaidinliu, Phulo, Jhano Murmu, Helen Lepcha and Putali Maya Tamang, will live on our collective memory for generations to come.During the coming week, we have planned a range of activities from tribal dance festivals, craft melas, painting competitions, felicitating tribal achievers, workshops, blood donation camps, and events to pay homage to the tribal freedom fighters. These are being organised across states and Union Territories as a mark of respect to these great sons and daughters of India. Their lives will continue to inspire Indians for all time to come.

14-11-2021||Today's||How should India remember Jawaharlal Nehru?||November 14 marked the 132nd birth anniversary of Jawaharlal Nehru, and, on the day, there was a section of the Indian public who took to Twitter to mock him. How should India remember Nehru?Let’s go back to August 1947 — a catastrophic time in India. Partition had claimed hundreds of thousands of lives, millions were forced to flee their homes; friends and neighbours had turned against each other. The treasury was in a shambles, and a large and diverse country did not have the peace, fraternity or resources to reconstruct itself.When Nehru gave his famous tryst with destiny speech on the eve of Independence, it was not clear what this destiny held in store for India.As independent India’s first prime minister, Nehru’s had onerous responsibilities. He had to deal with communal violence; the princely states were bargaining with the Indian Union, people’s basic needs had to be met. When Nehru completed his first term, there were glimmers of hope that India would achieve its potential.We had inherited a 0.72% growth rate from the British. This had climbed to 3.6% in five years. The dream of a unified India had taken permanent shape. Nehru realised that India could only go forward if it adopted a scientific approach. At a time when there were not enough roads or trains, he laid the foundations for space and nuclear institutions. In the field of education and medicine, the Indian Institutes of Technology and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences were set up. All this in a country which began Independence with a 12% literacy rate.It was to give India its rightful place in the world that Nehru, along with Yugoslavia’s Josip Broz Tito and Eygpt’s Gamel Abdel Nasser, conceptualised the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). It did not espouse the radical communism that the erstwhile Soviet Union had adopted but it stood against the rampant capitalism of the United States. NAM countries called themselves the Third World. Nehru, whose popularity transcended geographical boundaries, was among the leaders of newly independent countries of the time.Did this make him over-confident? Was this the reason he believed in the slogan “Hindi-Chini bhai-bhai” when dealing with China? The ignominious defeat of 1962 exposed his naiveté to some extent.This was not the only mistake Nehru made. He failed to correctly assess the situation in Jammu and Kashmir. It was a gross error to promise a plebiscite in Kashmir. The situation, which worsened after the arrest of Sheikh Abdullah, has not returned to normal to date. However, Nehru later publicly admitted that Sheikh Abdullah’s arrest was a wrong decision and, in this, he displayed his ability to own up to his misjudgment and accept criticism.On enacting the Hindu Code Bill, his critics were vocal that he should not have forgotten the minorities. Was he the only one to blame? It should not be forgotten that the Congress was a party of strong leaders at that time. Nehru often faced challenges from within the cabinet as well as in party forums. There was a discord between him and Purushottam Das Tandon, a resident of his city, Allahabad (now Prayagraj). Tandon had become president of the Congress without his consent and was later forced to step down by Nehru. In protest against his policies, Shyama Prasad Mookherjee also resigned from the cabinet and founded the Bharatiya Jana Sangh from which today’s Bharatiya Janata Party eventually emerged. What if Mookerjee had not left the Congress?Nehru’s differences with Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and Govind Vallabh Pant were well known. Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar, a member of his cabinet, also parted ways later. The Congress of that time was a democratic party in the true sense and Nehru was the first among equals. He was the leader of his party, but not the last word. That pernicious trend started with Indira Gandhi.Inspite of this, Nehru considered himself accountable to all Indians. It is said that he once went to Kanpur during an election campaign where a person at a public meeting told Nehru that he had given a ticket to a corrupt person. He listened, and answered that he may have made a mistake in giving the ticket but expressed confidence that the person who had made the assertion would not make the mistake of voting for a dishonest person.Perhaps, it was to clean up politics that he established grassroots democracy. Today, millions have been elected from more than 2.5 lakh panchayats, several of them being women and Dalits. This is a unique experiment in empowering people at the grassroots through democratic methods. The India fashioned in large part by Nehru has never seen a military coup, as witnessed in our neighbouring country on several occasions.We cannot assess Nehru through the prism of contemporary events. We can only get a true picture if we take into account the events of his time. This is something his critics often forget.Shashi Shekhar is editor-in-chief, Hindustan The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/how-should-india-remember-jawaharlal-nehru-101636895170329.html
14-11-2021||Today's||Is the India-China conflict intractable?||A senior Indian official recently told a visiting foreign counterpart that India’s relations with China were “irretrievably broken”. A trifle exaggerated, but the statement does reflect the mindset in New Delhi these days.
14-11-2021||Today's||Climate and Us | In Glasgow, as expectations rise, negotiations remain stuck||Will the Glasgow climate conference go down in history as the meeting that managed to save humanity from the catastrophic climate crisis? For now, this seems a bit unlikely because the Global north and south remain extremely divided over a number of important issues — how can the 1.5 degree goal be kept alive; the definition and nature of climate finance; how will rich nations compensate the poor for losses due to extreme climate events such as deadly cyclones and floods or slow onset events such as sea level rise. So many countries have so many redlines over so many issues that it now seems like the Glasgow outcome will be some sort of a compromise, which will pay lip service to each of these issues, but remain weak on the details.Keeping 1.5 degrees in sight would mean not just working out implementation strategies of existing pledges but also improving on these pledges very soon. The recent pledges by countries at the COP26 has, for the first time, given the world a shot at keeping global warming to under 2 degree C, according to three new scientific analyses.“#COP26 climate pledges mean Glasgow is getting closer to Paris! New @IEA analysis shows that fully achieving all net zero pledges to date & the Global Methane Pledge by those who signed it would limit global warming to 1.8 C. A big step forward, but much more needed!” tweeted Faith Birol, executive director of International Energy Agency on November 4. One of the key concerns for developing countries is whether bridging this gap in ambition will be equitable and whether the developed world will come forward to support emerging economies with climate finance and new technologies to implement their pledges.In Glasgow, a Scottish family is hosting me at their home. Hotels and Airbnbs were either fully booked or quoting astronomical tariffs during the COP26 dates; so I had requested a friend to help me find an accommodation. She put me in touch with an 82-year-old lady who is passionate about politics and the environment. Her daughter, a public interest environmental lawyer, and son, a sculptor, invited me to stay with them. The family is so concerned and excited about COP26 that they are tracking every deal closely. Each dinner is filled with discussions about climate politics and whether there will be justice for vulnerable countries with very low carbon footprints. The daughter has been attending all climate protests in the city during the past week and hopes Greta Thunberg is heard. COP26 is a personal, emotive moment for them. There are many more such Scottish families who are hosting activists, delegates during the climate talks, one of the ways to ensure representation of people from different ethnic, social and economic backgrounds.On Saturday, tens of thousands of activists, scientists and concerned citizens took to the streets all over United Kingdom calling for justice and action to stop the catastrophic climate crisis. Some activist-scientists in Glasgow chained themselves to draw attention.But the negotiations seem far removed from the urgency being demanded by activists. HT reported on Saturday that several red lines exist on key elements of negotiations. The developed countries have not agreed to any independent review of the delivery of $100 billion. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is keeping accounts of that fund. The developing countries have said OECD has been too generous and partial in its accounting of the money so they want a review. “The donors (developed countries) of course are deeply uncomfortable about such a review and number crunching. This I think will remain a red line,” said a senior official from the European Union delegation.Indian officials have said talks will breakdown if there is no resolution on climate finance, both a review of promised $100 billion and decision on a new, fairer and higher finance goal for the post-2025 period. There is no agreement on the nature of finance either — will it be concessional grant based? Or will private capital being invested be counted as climate finance? “We have made it clear that we don’t consider commercial finance to be climate finance. It has to be concessional, and grant based. They are not agreeing to review also. Most of our nationally determined contributions (NDCs) are conditional on long term finance. I think if there is no agreement on finance, the COP process will weaken in coming years and countries will do whatever they can according to their circumstances,” said a senior official of the Indian delegation in Glasgow.The negotiations seem cut off from public angst outside. The heads of states have left after making their pledges during the first week. The coming week is when difficult knots will have to be untangled and processes laid down. There will be loss of trust and disappointment among people if the Glasgow outcome doesn’t capture the urgency of the crisis.The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/climate-and-us-in-glasgow-as-expectations-rise-negotiations-remain-stuck-101636348207495.html
