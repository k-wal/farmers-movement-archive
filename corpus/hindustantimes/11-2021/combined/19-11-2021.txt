19-11-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra to withdraw farm laws in winter session||The Maharashtra government will repeal the farm laws that were tabled in the monsoon session to negate the three controversial laws, which were rolled back by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday. The state government is expected to withdraw them in the ensuing winter session.Revenue Minister Balasaheb Thorat said that since the original laws have been repealed, there is no need to pass the bills. “The decision will be taken in a meeting of group of ministers, headed by Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar,” he stated.Meanwhile, farmer unions are also of the opinion that the bills introduced should be withdrawn. “The bills are just milder versions of the central laws and we had objected to them. It allowed the price below MSP with mutual consent and non-lifting of the produce was not part of the harassment definition. We objected to the power the government had in terms of essential commodities. They should now be immediately withdrawn,” said Ajit Nawale, general secretary of Akhil Bharatiya Kisan Sabha.Maharashtra Agriculture Minister Dadaji Bhuse said that the decision would be taken by the ministerial committee. “We may say that the bills have no relevance now. Maharashtra government had in the past taken decisions and amended laws related to the marketing of agricultural produce,” he added. The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government-led Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray introduced three bills to counter the controversial central laws amid the farmers’ protest. The bills had the provisions for higher MSP for produce in farming agreement with traders, timely payment of dues, three-year jail term and ₹5 lakh fine or both for harassment of farmers. It has the provision to give power to the state to regulate and prohibit production, supply, distribution and impose stock limits of essential commodities.After the laws- Essential Commodities (Amendment), Farmers (Empowerment and Protection), Guarantee Price; Agriculture Related Agreements (Maharashtra Amendment) and Amendments to Central Government Farmer Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation)- were tabled in both the houses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-to-withdraw-farm-laws-in-winter-session-101637345832446.html

19-11-2021||Mumbai||Sameer Wankhede runs bar, hid info from department, alleges Nawab Malik||In another set of allegations, Maharashtra NCP Minister Nawab Malik claimed that Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) zonal director Sameer Wankhede violated Central Civil Services (Conduct) Rules 1964 by conducting business despite being in service.He said that Wankhede holds a hotel liquor licence since 1997-98 and runs a bar in Navi Mumbai. He added that the licence was issued when he was a minor in 1997-98, which again is illegal. “It was issued when his father Dnyandeo Wankhede was in the state excise department. He concealed this information while joining the central government services. Only in 2017, Wankhede declared that he owns the inherited property along with his father,” he alleged. Refuting the claims, Wankhede said that he had furnished all details of his properties to his department. “We have nothing to conceal. I have furnished all the details right from the properties I own and income clearly with my department since the day I joined the civil services,” he said.To corroborate his claims, Malik showed a document, that states that a liquor license was issued in the name of Sameer Dnyandev Wankhede on October 29, 1997. The documents further showed that the license was renewed every year.The NCP leader added that he will file a complaint with the department of personnel and training (DoPT), the state excise department and with all the concerned departments. “It is a clear case of forgery. For the last 24 years, the business has been operated on that license. The information was concealed,” he claimed. “In 2017, he shared false information with the central government that the hotel property, which he owns along with his father, is on lease. I have also given one of my properties on lease to a hotel operator and all the licenses required for operation are in the name of the operator. I can provide the land on lease, but the license for conducting business will have to be obtained only by the operator,” Malik said and added that Wakhende has no right to remain in service.A person from the Wankhede family said that Wakhende’s father looks after the business. “The hotel was bought by Wankhede’s mother Zaheda Bano in 1995 and she included him as joint owner of the property. He was a minor then. She looked after the business till 2015 and after her death, his father was made joint owner,” said the family member under conditions of anonymity. Malik has been levelling a series of charges against Wankhede, which have been refuted by the NCB officer. Malik had also alleged that Wankhede is a Muslim, but secured the IRS (Indian Revenue Service) job in the Scheduled Caste (SC) category, using his father’s old identity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sameer-wankhede-runs-bar-hid-info-from-department-alleges-nawab-malik-101637345531217.html

BJP leaders, he said, insulted the farmers and called them terrorists, traitors, goons, miscreants and authorities tortured them in various ways but all this could not break their spirit. Another senior RLD leader Anil Dubey said the government was forced to withdraw the ‘black’ laws after RLD chief Jayant Chaudhary’s rallies in support of farmers started drawing huge crowds. He demanded the government to immediately convene the special session of the Parliament to officially repeal the three laws. “Additionally, the government must render a public apology to farmers for calling them names,” Dubey demanded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-rld-hails-repeal-of-agricultural-laws-as-victory-of-farmers-struggle-101637345414751.html

Currently, medicines are prescribed based on a common formula for all the patients,” said Prof AK Tripathi, HoD clinical haematology and CFAR, KGMU.The CFAR organised a day-long symposium on ‘Precision and personalised medicine’, which had several speakers, including Prof Shally Awasthy, Prof Amita Pandey (both of KGMU), Dr K Thangaraj, director, centre for DNA fingerprinting and diagnostics, Hyderabad.Precision medicine works separately for each patient and is a mix of precise and personalised drugs, he said. The decision of medication is taken based on age, sex, gene, quality of life and social status.Prof Tripathi said that precision medicine shall first focus on cancer patients, and ovarian cancer shall be the first disease that will be worked on. “We shall hold a meeting to find out which disease has the poor success rate and then will work on that. We can take two or three diseases at a time,” said Prof Tripathi.Dr Shailendra Saxena of the CFAR said that not only in treatment but also in vaccine manufacturing, precision medicine is helpful.

19-11-2021||Mumbai||MSRTC strike enters 19th day: Commuters bear the brunt||Aroosa AhmedThousands of people residing in rural Maharashtra bore the brunt as employees of Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) continued their protest for the 19th day on Friday. As private bus operators capitalised on the strike, people who travel regularly on the Mumbai-Pune route also paid the price. For the ease of commuters, the MSRTC managed to operate less than one per cent of its buses from November 12. 131 buses were on the road on Friday and 3,517 passengers availed the services. Due to the limited number of transport options available, the residents of the interior parts of the state are shelling out double the amount they normally would. Meanwhile, as a disciplinary action, the MSRTC on Friday terminated 238 daily wage earners and suspended 297 employees. The total number of employees suspended so far is 2,776. Employees who continue to be on strike said that they have no other option left. “I have a family of six people, and I am the sole earner. My salary is Rs.15,000, which was also delayed throughout last year. The employees are suffering a lot and nobody is doing anything,” said Abhijit Dhamle, a driver at the Satara bus depot.The Maharashtra government has formed a three-member committee to look into the demands of the employees that include merger of the MSRTC with the state government, increase in salary, dearness and housing allowances.State Transport Minister Anil Parab had earlier asked the employees to return to work and has now stated that other options including privatisation of the corporation, is possible.“We have not decided on privatisation of MSRTC but it is our responsibility to operate bus services. We have kept all our options open as we do not want the commuters to suffer,” said Parab.However, the MSRTC unions alleged, “The privatisation agenda has always been there. It is more important now to make the MSRTC employees state government employees. We will continue the agitation till the demands are met,” said Shashank Rao, coordinator, Sangharsh ST Kamgar Union.Meanwhile, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) attacked the government over the issue. “The issues of employees need to be addressed first and then privatisation of the corporation can be talked about. Anil Parab is a son of a worker and should look into the issue,” said Prasad Lad, vice president of Maharashtra BJP. Senior citizens travelling for medical purposes are not able to find vehicles as well. “We wanted to commute for our regular diabetes check-ups. MSRTC buses charge Rs. 50 with the senior citizen concession. As the charges of private vehicles are exorbitant, senior citizens, who want to visit hospitals are going as a group and dividing the charges,” said Komal Yevle, a 62-year-old resident of Kopar Khairane in Thane district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/msrtc-strike-enters-19th-day-commuters-bear-the-brunt-101637344931288.html

Mishra had ‘bhojan prasad’ (food) after feeding the seers in Vrindavan on Friday. The BSP general secretary said that life is worthless without the ‘ashirwad’ (blessings) of the seers. The BSP general secretary reached Vrindavan on Friday and sought the blessings of the seers. Thereafter, he had ‘bhojan prasad’ with around 1000 seers. He was accompanied by former minister in state and former BSP MLA Shyam Sundar Sharma. “I have not come here for any politics. I am here for seeking blessings from the seers. I seek blessings of Thakur Bankey Behari, and Vrindavan, the seat of ‘Thakurji’, always inspires to do something new,” said Mishra.“It was during the reign of BSP, in the state, that projects worth crores were undertaken in Vrindavan, but thereafter there seems to be no sign of development. It was planned development undertaken by the BSP government by laying sewer lines, roads, electricity lines, widow ashram etc... BSP worked for providing ‘state fair’ status to Mudiya Poono Mela at Govardhan,” added Mishra. Mishra focussed on the Brahmin community and said they deserve respect. He assured safety and security to ‘sevayat’ (priests serving at temples) and was critical about the closing of Sanskrit schools due to lack of funds. He assured to re-start Sanskrit schools once BSP comes to power. Mishra termed the withdrawal of three farm laws as an ‘election stunt’ in wake of assembly elections in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. “Yet the government in the centre is praising three farm laws, and actual results would come after elections,” said Mishra. “We would strengthen the movement to save cows and would also constitute a commission for the safety of seers,” promised Mishra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bsps-satish-mishra-hosts-seers-in-vrindavan-101637344692687.html

19-11-2021||Mumbai||Mumbaiites may soon charge their Electric Vehicles at housing societies||Now, charging electric vehicles may no longer be inconvenient for Mumbaiites as the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is looking at setting up electric vehicle (EV) charging stations inside housing societies in the city. According to the civic body, the charging stations would be handed over to private contractors to operate while the societies could get some incentive from the civic body for offering space for the same.These charging stations could be used by residents of the societies as well as EV owners in the neighbouring area.The civic body is exploring various options to set up EV infrastructure in the city. It is also setting up EV charging stations in public places as well including the Public Parking Lot (PPL). A senior BMC official anonymously spoke to HT, saying, “If this plan is materialised, it will give people easy access to the EV charging points. The plan will require identifying such societies and complexes in the city and consulting with stakeholders.”He further informed, “The plan is at its primary stage. We will need to work out a proper plan before even approaching housing societies or complexes. The ultimate aim is to have sufficient public infrastructure for charging of EV’s in the coming years.”The BMC has a total of 26 PPLs in the city and in the coming month, each PPL is going to have an EV charging point. Along with this, the BMC also owns several on-street parking lots in the city where it plans similar charging points.How much does it cost to charge EV vehicles?According to BMC, it takes ₹15 per unit to charge an EV. In general, it takes around 20 to 30 units for an EV to be fully charged, so the total charging cost would be between ₹200 and ₹400.

He also laid the foundation stone of a ₹ 400 crore plant of Bharat Dynamics Limted, the first unit of the Jhansi node of UP Defence Industrial Corridor that would come up on 183 acres.This initiative would give Jhansi a new recognition, boost MSMEs (micro, small and medium enterprises) in the Bundelkhand region and create job opportunities for the youth, PM Modi said.The prime minister said the Bundelkhand region, once known for its valour and courage, would be playing the role of “sarathi’ in the UP Defence Industrial Corridor and would be one of the major centres of India’s defence strength.Remembering hockey legend Major Dhyan Chand who was from Jhansi, Modi said at a time when the strength of our forces is increasing, India was preparing the ground for the capable youth to protect the country in the future.He was referring to the opening of 100 new Sainik schools across the country that he launched from Jhansi.“These 100 Sainik Schools will work to put the future of the country in the hands of powerful people,” PM Modi said.Modi said the government has started the admission of girls in Sainik Schools.“Admission of girl students has started in 33 Sainik schools. They will produce daughters like Rani Laxmi Bai to take the responsibility of defence, security and development of the country,” he said.These Sainik Schools would be set up in partnership with private institutions. In all, the PM inaugurated or laid the foundation stone for projects worth ₹3414 crore in Jhansi. It included an ultra mega solar park worth ₹3000 crore in Garautha, which would produce 600 megawatt of electricity on completion.Laying emphasis on gaining self-reliance in defence, he said history was replete with examples that India never lost a war for lack of courage and valour. “If Rani Laxmi Bai had modern weapons like the British back in 1857 (the First War of Independence), history would have been different,” PM Modi said.The time has come when India, which was known as an arms buyer, would be a global player in arms export, he stressed.“The mantra is Make in India—Make for the World,” he said, adding the Ministry of Defence has released a list of 200 military equipment that would be bought from Indian companies to boost Atmanirbhar Bharat.“These equipment cannot be bought from overseas anymore. There is a ban now,” he said.At the ceremony, PM Modi formally gave light combat helicopter (LCH) designed and developed by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) to Air Force chief Air Chief Marshal VR Chaudhari, drones and UAVs built by Indian start-ups to Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane, and the DRDO-designed and Bharat Electronics Limited-manufactured advanced electronic warfare suite for naval ships to Navy chief Admiral Karambir Singh. Modi also launched the National Cadet Corps (NCC) Alumni Association in Jhansi.Besides, the prime minister reached Jhansi Fort and launched the National Programme of Simulation Training for NCC cadets with the aim to scale up simulation training facilities for all three wings of NCC. He interacted with 33 newly joined girl students from Sainik Schools, representing all the 33 Sainik Schools in the country.Earlier, he unveiled stone signage on Maharani Laxmi Bai and inaugurated Atal Ekta Park in Jhansi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/pm-modi-hands-over-indigenous-light-combat-helicopter-other-equipment-to-armed-forces-in-jhansi-101637342531007.html
19-11-2021||Mumbai||Political parties, groups welcome decision on farm laws, say it’s victory of farmers||Farmers’ outfits and political parties in the state welcomed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement to withdraw three farm laws and described it as a victory for the farmers. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said that the central government should take stakeholders and Opposition parties into confidence to avoid such embarrassment in the future. On the other hand, NCP chief and former union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar took a jibe at the Central government and said that they repealed the laws because they were afraid that they would have to pay the price in the upcoming Uttar Pradesh and Punjab Assembly elections.“Fortunately, farmers from parts of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana were involved in the agitation. They realised that they will have to pay the price and thus repealed the laws,” Pawar said.He also talked about the resilience of farmers who sat through harsh weather conditions to mark their protest. The chief minister said that the announcement is an example of the strength of the common man of this country.“Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi has repeatedly clarified its stand against the farm laws. Besides, we have also discussed their adverse effects in the state cabinet meeting and in the state legislature. The central government would not have to face the humiliation if they had taken all the opposition parties and the concerned organizations in confidence before enacting the three legislations,” Thackeray said in a statement.He added, “Those who provide us food sacrificed their lives unnecessarily. But the feeders have shown their strength, I salute them. I humbly pay respects to the heroes who sacrificed their lives in the protest.”However, state BJP chief Chandrakant Patil said that the decision will lead to losses for farmers. He added that the decision was taken unwillingly. “The farm laws were introduced to safeguard the interest of the farmers. The decision to repeal them will cause a lot of losses and damage. Barring a few groups of farmers from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, farmers from across the country were in favour of the laws. We failed to convince the importance of the laws to this small group of farmers,” he stated.Social activist Ulka Mahajan, who participated in the agitations, said, “This is a big lesson to all political parties that you cannot win elections by cheating the farmers and hurting their interests.” State revenue minister and senior Congress leader Balasaheb Thorat said that the Central government cannot run away from the atrocities meted out to the farmers during their protest. “The Modi government should take responsibility for the deaths of the farmers and apologise for it,” he said.Prominent farmer leader Raju Shetti thanked Modi for repealing the act. “It shows that you cannot pass such laws on a brute majority,” said Shetti.Farmers also welcomed the decision. Kamalkishor Jogdande, a farmer from Bhokardan in Jalna district, said, “I welcome the decision. The laws were against the interest of farmers and would have deprived us of the existing benefits.”Ajit Nawale, state general secretary of Akhil Bharatiya Kisan Sabha, which has been at the forefront in representing farmers in Maharashtra, said that the fight will continue.“The fight will continue till the implementation of the Swaminathan commission’s recommendations, guarantee of minimum support price and law for the assured returns on input cost,” he stated, adding that although 600 farmers lost their lives, they welcome the decision. Quote to highlight:The decision to repeal them will cause a lot of losses and damage.

19-11-2021||Ranchi||JMM threatens economic blockade against Tata group over shifting Cummins’ registered office||The ruling Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) legislators have threatened an economic blockade of Tata group if their firm Tata Cummins continued with its plan to shift its corporate office from Jamshedpur to another state. Two days back, JMM workers led by its legislators had held a day-long sit-in outside the gates of all Tata group production units, including Tata Steel, Tata Motors and Tata Cummins. However, Tata Cummins has said its plans to shift its registered office from Jamshedpur to Pune would not make any impact on its Jamshedpur operations or the prevailing employment scenario or other welfare work it does in the state. Alleging that the Tata Group companies, which have had a long association with Jamshedpur, are now trying to relocate as their government came up with laws to ensure 75% of jobs go to locals, JMM legislators from Kolhan division met in Jamshedpur on Thursday where they decided to launch a major protest, besides taking up the issue with the chief minister. “Our meeting was chaired by tribal welfare minister Champai Soren. It was decided that we will wait for 20 days. If the company does not come out with a solution, we will begin an economic blockade. We have also authorised our minister to take up the issue with the chief minister. A delegation of all MLAs and party office bearers would meet the CM over the issue,” said Ramdas Soren, a three-term legislator from Ghatsila in East Singhbhum district (Jamsedhpur). Soren alleged that Tata Cummins has applied to change its income tax filing address from Jharkhand to Maharashtra, which is a step towards shifting its base. “The income tax department has sought no-objection clearance from the state government. If that is done, it will change the legal jurisdiction of the company as all legal rules of this state won’t be applicable anymore over it. What if any worker has a legal issue with the company. Will he go to Maharashtra to fight any legal battle,” Soren said. However, following the protest, Tata Cummins issued a statement categorically denying media reports about shifting its Jamshedpur operations. “The process for the transfer of Registered Office of Tata Cummins Private Limited (TCPL) from Jamshedpur to Pune was initiated a few years ago to facilitate the ease of administrative operations with the Corporate Office. The shifting of the registered office will not impact the revenue, employment, and welfare opportunities for the state of Jharkhand or the city of Jamshedpur. We continue to abide by all the labour laws and other compliances, as applicable for the state of Jharkhand,” the statement said. “We established our presence in Jamshedpur in 1993. In the last 28 years, we have created thousands of jobs in the region and supported the community. There has been significant investment in Jamshedpur operations in all these years to adopt and upgrade to advanced technologies, increase our production capacity and capability. Our commitment towards Corporate Responsibility in and around the region has positively helped uplift communities, safeguarded the environment and social welfare, which has only increased over the years,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/jmm-threatens-economic-blockade-against-tata-group-over-shifting-cummins-registered-office-101637336350446.html

19-11-2021||Patna||Attack on Bihar judge: HC steps in, police body seeks justice for cops||The alleged attack on a controversial judge in Bihar’s Madhubani district by two police officers on Thursday is set to snowball into a major controversy, with the Bihar Police Association (BPA) linking the incident with the attack on the policemen in the court premises.Additional district and sessions judge (ADJ-1) in Jhanjharpur subdivisional court, Avinash Kumar, who has often hit the headlines with his unusual orders, has alleged station house officer (SHO) of Ghoghardiha police station, Gopal Krishna, and sub-inspector Abhimanyu Kumar Sharma entered his chamber on Thursday afternoon, assaulted him and even pointed a pistol at him. Within hours of the incident, the Patna High Court took suo motu cognisance and Chief Justice Sanjay Karol set up a special division bench to hear the matter.“As per directions of the chief justice, the present case has been listed before this bench for a special hearing after a report received from the in-charge district and sessions judge, Madhubani, in respect of physical attack and assault on ADJ-1 Avinash Kumar. He has reported that around 2 pm, the station house officer (SHO) of Ghoghardiha police station Gopal Krishna, along with Abhimanyu Kumar Sharma, sub-inspector of police, forcibly entered the chamber of Avinash Kumar-I, and started abusing him. On his protest, both police officers started misbehaving and manhandling the judge. Not only this, they also assaulted him. They also took out their service revolvers and wanted to attack the officer. However, certain court employees and advocates reached there due to which life of the officer was saved,” the bench of Justice Rajan Gupta and Justice Mohit Kumar Shah, which heard the matter, said. “Prima facie, it appears that this episode puts the independence of judiciary in jeopardy.”The next hearing in the case has been fixed for November 29.BPA president Mrityunjay Singh, however, said the truth must come out after thorough probe. “If policemen are responsible, they must be punished, but case should also be lodged against those who beat up policemen in the court premises. Law is the same for everyone,” he said.He said nobody saw what happened with the judge, but the injured policemen and blood stains on their uniform was visible to everyone. “We just want justice to be done. Had the SHO carried any malice, he would not have gone there on a phone call from the judge? There should be justice with the injured SHO also and his FIR should also be lodged,” he said.The injured police officers are currently undergoing treatment at Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital. An FIR has been lodged against both of them on the statement of the ADJ Avinash Kumar.“How could he give oral orders to the SHO in his capacity as head of the subdivisional legal services authority (SDLSA) to come to his chamber? There was no written order to the SHO. He was asked thrice on phone to come to the court premises even though he was not under the same subdivision or under his jurisdiction,” said Mritunjay Singh, adding that the Ghoghardiha police station falling under the jurisdiction of Phulparas sub-division. According to state police headquarters, the judge had summoned the SHO in a case related to one Usha Devi, who lodged a complaint that the Ghoghardiha police had falsely implicated her in a case. Both the police officers were thrashed mercilessly outside the chamber of ADJ and confined in a room inside the court premises. On getting information, inspector general of police (Darbhanga range) Ajitabh Kumar, Madhubani superintendent of police Dr Satya Prakash and district magistrate Amit Kumar reached the spot around 9 pm and rescued the policemen. Additional director general of police (headquarters) Jitendra Singh Gangwar, who physically appeared before the bench for Thursday’s hearing, confirmed that a case has been lodged against the two police officers and both were taken into custody. Judge Avinash Kumar has been in the headlines for his unusual orders. In one such order, he granted bail to a molestation accused on the condition that he would wash clothes of the entire village for free. While he was posted in Patna, he had served show-cause notices on the chief secretary and the state police chief for non-compliance of the order to deduct ₹2,500 from the DM and SP’s salaries in a lynching case and deposit the sum to the CM Relief Fund. In fact, on September 24 this year, the Patna high court seized all his judicial powers of ADJ Avinash Kumar.The judge’s FIRIn the FIR, additional district judge Aviansh Kumar claimed the SHO entered his chamber, started talking in very loud tone saying it was his style. “You instruct our boss (SP Dr Satyaprakash) to be present in the court by serving a notice. You sent me a notice as well. Today, we will show you your status,” the SHO allegedly told the judge.The FIR says sub-inspector Abhimanyu Sharma joined the SHO, who whipped up his service revolver and pointed at the judge. “Today, I will send you away from this world because I have got orders and support from our boss... We have come to show you your status at his behest,” they allegedly told him. According to SHO of Jhannjharpur police station, Neha Kumari, the accused policemen have been arrested and booked.

19-11-2021||Mumbai||Covid vaccine doses lying unused in private centres in Thane||Around one lakh vaccine doses are lying with private vaccination centres across Thane city. With hardly a handful of people opting for private vaccination, the chances of these doses going waste have increased.Doctors from private hospitals in Thane city suggested putting the excess vaccine doses to use rather than waste them.The Serum Institute of India’s Covishield has a shelf life of nine months. Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin has a shelf life of six months, but it has now been extended to 12 months.Private hospitals were allowed to procure vaccines directly from the manufactures from May this year. Soon after a shortage of doses in government hospitals were noted, this prompted many private players to stock themselves with as many vaccine doses as available.However, with the increase of vaccination centres within the Thane civic body and increased availability of free doses, the accessibility towards government vaccination centres were on the rise.The demand for private vaccination centres declined. Even those who took the first jab through a private facility started preferring free second jabs at government facilities. Most private hospitals, therefore, have ample vaccine stocks and with nine to 12 months as the expiry date of these vaccine doses, they are likely to expire between February and April 2022. Currently many of the private hospitals allow vaccination within their premises only once a week as the demand has dipped drastically. On Wednesday and Thursday, the civic body saw hardly 200 and 120 vaccines, respectively, administered in private hospitals across Thane city.Dr Amol Gitte, medical director, Siddhivinayak Hospital, Thane, said, “Now, in private hospitals, we are only receiving beneficiaries who are due for their second dose. The government or local civic body can now make use of the vaccines available in private centres before the existing ones reach expiry date.”Some hospitals like Jupiter are conducting vaccination sessions only once a week as the demand has decreased drastically.Post Diwali, less than 500 vaccine doses are being administered on a daily basis in private centres across Thane Municipal Corporation jurisdiction. Meanwhile, around 13,000 vaccine doses are administered by government centres daily.It was from September that the demand for private vaccination started falling. All those who could afford to pay for vaccination eagerly came forward to get jabbed as soon as the doses were available for all age groups initially. As private vaccination centres were available easily through online booking, many availed the same in the beginning.Moreover, there were planned vaccination camps conducted in residential areas and corporates that were available to many more. “Thus only those who cannot afford private vaccines or those who are reluctant to get the vaccine were left unvaccinated. Every hospital has sourced these vaccine vials and paid for them as well. Hence, they may expect payment for the vials if any local governing authority shows interest,” said a senior doctor from a private hospital in Thane.Dr Santosh Kadam, president, Indian Medical Association, Thane chapter, said, “There are certain pockets in the city or within Thane district where vaccination continues to be less. Corporates can consider these as CSR activities and provide vaccines from private hospitals to such remote areas for free. As there continues to be reluctance among these pockets to get vaccinated, through CSR activities, more awareness with the help of fun sessions can be inculcated.”Until August, Thane city had the most number of vaccine stock available in private centres than government centres. There used to be serpentine queues outside government centres but the shortage of vaccine prompted many to get inoculated at private centres. Moreover, many housing societies and private corporate offices conducted the vaccination through the private vaccination facility in the months of June and July. Vipin Sharma, TMC commissioner, said, “We have not yet received any official order regarding usage of vaccine vials with private centres. Our focus is to meet 100% first dose vaccination across the city as of now. If need be, we can make use of those vials as a booster dose of vaccination. However, we are awaiting an order from the State government on the same.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid-vaccine-doses-lying-unused-in-private-centres-in-thane-101637335990669.html
19-11-2021||Mumbai||Malavika’s Mumbaistan: Paradise Found||Not the hedonism of champagne-quaffing oligarchs, nor the giddy getaway of party-hearty bikini babes, but a measured, deeply immersive experience of serenity, harmony and natural beauty, Soneva Jani’s recently launched Chapter Two, in the Maldives, a cluster of 27 overwater villas – said to be the largest and most luxurious of their kind in the world, each featuring vast indoor and outdoor living spaces, sweeping terraces, sumptuous private pools and breath-taking water slides – have been designed to generate such a profound sense of equanimity and pleasure that it is easy to feel a meditative calm descend upon you, as you give yourself over to the endless blue ocean, panoramic skyscapes and the sound of the gentle, ebbing and flowing of the waves under you. A lucky break has brought you here, your first trip abroad since the pandemic and divested of your mask and shoes, you can feel yourself unwind, relax and breathe… Gradually, you begin to notice the artistry of your surroundings: the undulating sensuality of the resort’s unvarnished wood; the delightful idiosyncrasy of cutlery and clothes pegs, fashioned to look like fish; the retractable roof in the master bedroom, which slides back at the touch of a button, so you can lie in bed and gaze at the stars at night; the sumptuously inviting day beds which allow you the luxury of lounging whenever you please, without having to worry about ‘evening service’; gentle, subdued lighting, emanating from lights made to resemble giant sea animals, which cast dreamy sensuous shadows; outdoor showers and bathtubs that allow you to contemplate your surroundings in solitary splendour. And the flickering of a thousand small lamps as night descends, making the resort appear as a magical utopian neighbourhood in some sci-fi fantasy and not another luxury resort operated by a large faceless conglomerate obsessed with its bottom line, unconcerned with how its guests sleep, dream, are nourished and unwind… **********************************************************************************************************************What is remarkable in the Soneva story is that the redefining of the conventional luxury resort, and in fact, the creation of the Maldives as one the world’s leading luxury holiday destinations, is the handiwork of an Indian businessman and his Swedish wife. When Sonu Shivdasani – scion of a genteel and philanthropic London-based Sindhi clan and Eva Malmström, a former top fashion model – first chanced upon the inhabited islands in the Indian Ocean 25 years ago, they were a haven for low-budget group tours. Slowly, assiduously, the sophisticated world-travelling couple created the resort of their dreams, a place for people like themselves who appreciate that true luxury lies not in objects and brands, but in the appreciation of nature, slow living, simplicity, conscious consumption and privacy. Ideas that had seemed almost eccentric 25 years ago, but which today, in a post-pandemic world have become not only de rigeur but imperative. That luxury can be intelligent and responsible has always been at the core of the Soneva story. As concerned as they are about affording their guests with unforgettable bespoke one-of-a-kind experiences, there is also deep thought given to the underpinning philosophy on how to create this. In fact, Sonu has always envisaged Soneva as being a platform for great minds and path breaking, thoughts and ideas. Which explains why next year, for the first time, the group has partnered with the Jaipur Lit festival to set up tent at one of its resorts in the Maldives. “The theme of the festival is very much aligned with our core brand philosophy. Environment, travel, wellness, history, sustainability, poetry, astronomy and more, will be part of the panel discussions, events and workshops,” says the man whose vision not only transformed a group of islands into one of the world’s premier luxury destinations, but also made his resorts the go-to choice for some of the planet’s wealthiest and most famous personalities, who recognise and appreciate what true luxury really means.  ******************************************************************************************************************Thanks to her parents and her Swedish heritage, Eva says she was always brought up thinking of the planet. “No one understood my wish to take care of the environment, including my husband, who at the time thought ‘green’ was just a colour!” she laughs. Nevertheless she soldered on, stressing the need for sustainability and protection of the environment long before it was fashionable and earning for herself the sobriquet ‘The Conscience’ amongst her colleagues. This heightened sensitivity to Mother Earth made her ensure that not a single tree was to be cut and only sustainable wood was used for the construction of the resorts and their furniture. Thanks to Eva‘s insistence, the group bans the use of unethically produced feathers for pillows and duvets, the sale of coral and shells, endangered animal skins and the consumption of unethical, cruel food such as wild caviar, foie gras and Bluefin tuna (as they are almost extinct) and recycles all its waste even as it protects the coral reef and shoreline. The other belief that Eva and Sonu subscribe to is that true luxury is eating fresh, healthy food. Thus, every resort has its own organic garden where it grows fruit, vegetables and herbs, so guests can savour their meals knowing that the food they consume is free of chemicals, and fair-traded and sourced sustainably. “I think real luxury is freedom, privacy and time to relax in a laid-back environment,” says Eva. “Our beaches are designed so you don’t see a soul; to be able to sit in the open air, with your toes in the sand, not having to wear shoes – that’s a big luxury.” India has always been a key market for the Maldives because of its proximity, but since the post-pandemic reopening of the borders earlier this year and the air travel bubble between the two countries, this has accelerated, resulting in more flights between the two countries and even a daily direct flight to Male from Mumbai. Over 157,000 tourists arrived from India from January to August – a 300% over the earlier year, according to authorities. The opening of its Chapter Two during this period is a validation of this demand. In many ways, it symbolises a kind of ‘Chapter Two’ for the group as it enters its 26th year, with further plans of expansion and talks of opening new properties in South East Asia (though a resort in India, unfortunately, is not on the anvil at the moment). Also, as the world recovers from the cataclysmic pandemic, hopefully, the planet itself could embark on its own Chapter Two – with a new-found appreciation for the environment, sustainability and living harmoniously with nature, concepts that have been the hallmark of Sonu and Eva’s philosophy. “The past 20 months have been a challenging time for everyone, and I think it has made people rethink what is important in their lives. I believe the world is striving for real experiences now,” says Sonu. Eva agrees. “Looking to the future, as we come out of the pandemic, I think that global travellers will be seeking more health-focused travel options, and hopefully become more aware of the natural environment around them, and as a result more sensitive to the challenges of the planet.” So forget all those Insta pics of bikini babes and filthy rich plutocrats partying on yachts; the big boys and girls know that ‘Chapter Two’ – intelligent, sustainableluxury, is an idea whose time has come.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/malavikas-mumbaistan-paradise-found-101637335750735.html
19-11-2021||Mumbai||Was unfairly targeted, says Vikram Gokhale; defends his decision to support Kangana Ranaut||Veteran actor Vikram Gokhale on Friday defended his support to actor Kangana Ranaut for her controversial comment. However, he insisted he had not made any insulting remarks against freedom fighters. In addition, he said it was time for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Shiv Sena to come together for the sake of the nation. Gokhale said he has his reasons for supporting Ranaut’s statement and is entitled to do so, as it is his right as an Indian citizen. “I don’t know Kangana, nor have I worked with her. However, I was unfairly targeted after I supported her statement. Let me make it clear, I have said nothing about the freedom fighters,” said Gokhale. He said the popular slogan that our freedom was attained without shedding any blood was an insult to the revolutionaries who were killed or hanged while fighting for India’s independence. He said that the India of 1962 was very different from that of 2021, and even our enemies acknowledge this fact. Ranaut, commenting at a summit, had said that India got ‘bheek’ (alms) in 1947, and attained her ‘real freedom’ in 2014, referring to Narendra Modi being elected as the Prime Minister. This had drawn huge criticism from citizens across the nation. Gokhale was among the very rare personalities who supported her contention. Gokhale described the recent case of the arrest of Aryan Khan, son of actor Shah Rukh Khan as a minor matter. He further added he has refused offers to join politics and he would continue to criticise the wrong policies of anyone in power, irrespective of the party in power. Gokhale, who is one of the renowned names in Marathi and Hindi cinema, said that the secularism being practised in India was actually pseudo-secularism, which he did not subscribe to. Speaking of Maharashtra politics, he said, “The BJP-Shiv Sena have been together for 25 years and they were practising one agenda, which is important for the nation. They fought the elections together and citizens voted for both the parties, but they are deceived today,” said Gokhale.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/was-unfairly-targeted-says-vikram-gokhale-defends-his-decision-to-support-kangana-ranaut-101637335090499.html

A female engineering student arrested by Gorakhpur police in Jabalpur for carrying the knife said she wasn’t the only one, and many women carried the knife for protection.When the police inquired, it turned out that everyone bought the knife from online shopping sites.“When we checked with the shopping sites, they informed us that 2,300 Chinese knives were sold in the past one year to residents of Jabalpur,” said superintendent of police, Jabalpur, Siddharth Bahuguna.Bahuguna said they sought a list of people who purchased the knives online and started the process of taking action against them.Under the Arms Act, it is illegal to carry a knife with a blade longer than 9 inches and a width of 2 inches, or more.The district police chief said he has ordered all police stations to put out notices and awareness posters informing people that Chinese knives are banned in the city and file FIRs under the Arms Act against people carrying such knives.Additional superintendent of police Rohit Keswani said it wasn’t that the police will start booking everyone who bought the knife. “The action will be taken against people as per the size and purpose of purchase of knives,” he said.The engineering student who found herself on the wrong side of the law because of the knife, said: “Many women carry this knife for self-protection and because it was a foldable folding knife so it is easy to carry”.“The police came to me and checked my bag like I am a criminal. Later, they took me to the police station. My family is still in shock because of this incident,” said the student who was released on bail in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/jabalpur-cops-ban-chinese-knives-tell-amazon-flipkart-to-stop-delivery-101637334310883.html

This has happened due to levelling work ongoing on the highway. This road has deep potholes and boulders, thus making this road a very perilous one to traverse on,” said Arjit Chatterjee, resident of Ivy Estate.The Ivy Estate Federation claims to have held multiple talks with senior management of Kolte Patil.On November 13-14, residents held a silent protest.Mukesh Jaitley, head of operations at Kolte Patil Developers, said, “We are ready and willing to get the road done and the length is also not an issue, but there is a family litigation on this plot due to which this land has not been bought by Kolte Patil Developers, but is part of the proposed road in the sanctioned plan. A stay order has been put by the court on any construction activities on this land.”On November 15, residents held a meeting with the PMRDA commissioner to discuss the road issue. MLA Ashok Bapusaheb Pawar, along with residents, met with commissioner Suhas Divase and metropolitan planner Vivek Kharwadkar. “We were assured by the commissioner of PMRDA that they will issue a show- cause notice to Kolte Patil Developer to get the issue resolved,” said Chatterjee, who was present for the meeting.“An on site inspection on November 16 was conducted by PMRDA and it was found that 120 metres of road is in a bad condition and needs to be redone, hence, we have issued showcause notice to Kolte Patil Developers,” said Vivek Kharwadkar of the PMRDA.The notice asks the builder to clarify why should there be no stay order be put on ongoing projects. It also mentions that further documentation requests by the builder will be rejected, and no PMRDA certification will be provided to Kolte Patil Developers until a proper road is provided.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmrda-issues-kolte-patil-developers-showcause-notice-over-ivy-estate-road-101637333050331.html

HKS also reiterated that till the withdrawal of these laws through proper parliamentary process, farmers will not end their protest. Rakesh Singha, former general secretary of HKS and CPIM legislator MLA from Theog, said that the government had left no stone unturned to defame the farmers’ movement.“A conspiracy was hatched to defame farmers by calling them terrorists and Khalistanis. An attempt was made to create a divide between Haryana-Punjab, Sikh-Jat, rich farmer-poor farmers,” he alleged. But the government finally had to bow down before the solidarity of the farmers, added Singha. He said that farmers should not forget that the central government is the “killer” of more than 700 farmers, including those killed in Lakhimpur Kheri incident. He said farmers should unite and continue their fight for remunerative price on C2+50% basis as per Swaminathan Commission.HKS state president Kuldeep Singh Tanwar said there were many issues facing the agriculture sector in Himachal Pradesh on which farmers will have to fight on the lines of national movement. “MSP is yet to be implemented in Himachal, permanent markets have not yet been established in the state for the purchase of food grains. Farmers in Fatehpur of Kangra are already bearing the brunt of lack of markets,” he said. He said farmers of Himachal were also not getting MSP for vegetables and compensation if crop is destroyed in natural calamity. The government has abolished the subsidy given for vegetables and crops, including horticulture.Tanwar said the National Farmers’ Movement has instilled a new confidence in the farmers of Himachal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/a-victory-of-farmers-says-himachal-kisan-sabha-as-pm-s-announces-repeal-farm-laws-101637332210058.html

CIDCO is functioning as the Special Planning Authority for the NAINA area. The Board of CIDCO has now resolved to incorporate certain provisions of the UDCPR of GoM in NAINA region, which shall facilitate ease of doing business.” This will also allow for quicker development of the NAINA project.To prevent haphazard development around the Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA), CIDCO has proposed the development of NAINA on 371sqkm of land from the Thane and Raigad districts.

19-11-2021||Patna||Nitish Kumar is asked about PM Modi decision to scrap 3 farm laws. His response||PATNA: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, who earlier advocated engaging farmers opposed to the three agricultural laws in dialogue, on Friday declined to comment on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s surprise announcement to withdraw the three contentious laws.“The central government got the farm laws cleared in Parliament. It was the decision of the PM. Now, he himself has announced that they will be repealed in the next session of Parliament, PM explained it very clearly. The decision is his, there cannot be any reaction to this,” the chief minister said at Patna airport on his return from the national capital Delhi.The chief minister’s ‘no comment’ approach on PM Modi’s televised address was seen as an attempt to distance himself from the contentious laws that he and his party, Janata Dal (United), supported. Kumar did, however, insist all along that the controversy around the three laws did not impact farmers in Bihar because the state did away with the Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) more than a decade ago and put in place an alternative system.Like many others in the ruling alliance, Nitish Kumar also attributed the protests against the three farm laws to “misconceptions” and asked that the Centre to engage farmers in a dialogue to clear their apprehensions. In all, the Centre and farm union leaders held 11 rounds of discussions, the last one in January 2021 after the Supreme Court stayed implementation of the contentious farm lawsOn February 8, Nitish Kumar told reporters that the central government will clarify the benefits of the new laws to farmers.Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad tweeted his congratulations to farmers on the success of their democratic and peaceful agitation and lambasted the “pro-capitalist government” for efforts to malign the image of farmers by branding them as terrorists, Khalistanis, and anti-nationals. “The nation is run by restraint, decency, tolerance and based on prudent and all-encompassing decisions with democratic values, and not through the wrestling,” said Prasad.Senior Congress leaders such as Bihar chief Madan Mohan Jha underlined Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s continued support to the farmers and counted his relentless opposition as one of the reasons why the centre was forced to concede to the farmers’ demands.Opposition leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav said that it was a victory of farmers and the whole of India. “The Centre’s decision to take back the law can be seen as the defeat of capitalists, their patrons and egoist Nitish-Narendra Modi regime,” he added.CPI(ML) general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya, saluting the farmers’ movement, said the Modi regime has been pushed back by the heroic struggle and sacrifices of the farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/nitish-kumar-is-asked-about-pm-modi-decision-to-scrap-3-farm-laws-his-response-101637331012057.html
19-11-2021||Mumbai||Only 0.29% got Covid despite being fully vaccinated in Mumbai||Only 16,967 people in Mumbai got the Covid-19 infection despite being fully vaccinated, data collated by the civic body has shown. Infections that occur two weeks after full vaccination are known as breakthrough infections. According to the Brihanmumbai Mumbai Corporation (BMC), these infections accounted for only 0.29% of the 5,809,294 people who had received both shots, as of November 14. The civic body data also showed that of the 3,277,061 people who had received only one dose, around 17,171 or 0.52% got the infection. “Breakthrough infections are minuscule in comparison to the infections seen among the non-vaccinated population,” said Dr Mangala Gomare, executive health officer of the BMC. “Vaccination has played a crucial role in reducing the number of infections, which is why we have focussed all our energy in reaching 100% full vaccination coverage,” she said. Mumbai has an adult population of 9.2 million people eligible for vaccination. The civic body has achieved 100% first dose coverage and the two doses or full vaccination coverage is just around 68%. Medical experts say that while one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine may offer some protection, both doses are crucial for long-term immunity. Infectious disease expert Dr Om Srivastava, who is also a member of the Covid-19 task force, said that the cases of breakthrough infections are mild. “But these patients do have fever, body ache and weakness and take around 10 days to recover. It’s like a regular bout of viral illness. None of my patients has had a severe form of Covid-19, requiring oxygen or intensive care,” he said. The immune response generated by the vaccines in some individuals is not the same as others, which perhaps causes a small percentage of breakthrough infections. “The immunocompromised population is more likely to get breakthrough infections, as they often don’t have adequate immunity triggered by the vaccines,” said Dr Srivastava, adding people should therefore continue taking precautions and adhere to Covid-appropriate behaviour despite full vaccination. According to the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), fully vaccinated people with a vaccine breakthrough infection are less likely to develop a serious illness than those who are unvaccinated and get Covid-19. “Even when fully vaccinated people develop symptoms, they tend to be less severe symptoms than in unvaccinated people. This means they are much less likely to be hospitalized or die than people who are not vaccinated,” it said. The CDC also recommends that moderately to severely immunocompromised people receive an additional primary dose of vaccine. Many health experts in India too are rooting for a booster dose for the healthcare workers and people with comorbid conditions. Physician and intensivist Dr Pravin Amin who practices at the Breach Candy Hospital said that patients with breakthrough infections commonly have fewer antibody titers. Antibody titers determine the level of antibodies in the blood. “Barring one patient who required oxygen support, all the cases breakthrough infections that I have seen have been very mild,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/only-0-29-got-covid-despite-being-fully-vaccinated-in-mumbai-101637331009807.html
19-11-2021||Mumbai||Return ₹6.5 lakh seized from 2 senior citizens in 2008: Bombay HC to customs dept||The Bombay high court (HC) has directed the customs department to refund an amount of ₹6.5 lakh, which was seized from the home of two senior citizens by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) in 2008. The court has expressed its anguish over the “callous manner” in which the agency was treating senior citizens and delaying the refund, though the adjudicating authority had directed DRI to do so in 2011 while the Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (west zonal bench) in 2018 had also passed the same order. A division bench of justice S J Kathawalla and justice Abhay Ahuja, while hearing the petition of a couple – Mohammed Sajid and Shazia Khan – was informed by their advocate Shehzad Naqvi that DRI had seized cash worth ₹6.5 lakh on April 17, 2008, from the senior citizens’ Byculla residence as alleged profits from the export of red sander, which is a protected item under the Customs Act. Naqvi informed the bench that in 2011, the adjudicating authority had observed that there was no evidence to prove that the seized cash was proceeds of the alleged offence and hence, could not be confiscated under the relevant provisions of the Customs Act. Thereafter, the couple had applied to DRI seeking return of the amount, but did not receive any response. On the contrary, in 2012, the customs commissioner (appeal) had imposed a penalty of ₹10 lakh on the couple and the seized amount was adjusted with the penalty amount. Thereafter, the couple filed an appeal against the commissioner’s order, which was heard in 2018. The tribunal which heard the appeal set aside the penalty order and directed the authorities to return the seized amount of ₹6.5 lakh. However, after a passage of three years as the couple had not received the amount they approached HC. After hearing the submissions, the bench observed, “We fail to understand why senior citizens of our society are being treated by the statutory authorities in such a callous manner by not refunding the amount seized from their residence despite them having secured favourable orders at least since 2018, consequently, compelling them to file the above writ petition.” The bench then directed the counsel for joint commissioner of customs (refund), advocate Jitendra Mishra, to give an undertaking to refund the amount within a period of one week. After Mishra informed the court that the authorities would affect the refund within the time stipulated by the bench, the petition was disposed of.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/return-6-5-lakh-seized-from-2-senior-citizens-in-2008-bombay-hc-to-customs-dept-101637330949735.html
19-11-2021||Chandigarh||Ghulam Nabi Azad welcomes repeal of farm laws, says move should have come earlier||Senior Congress leader and former Rajya Sabha member Ghulam Nabi Azad on Friday welcomed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement to repeal the three farm laws, adding that many lives could have been saved, had the decision been made early. “It would have been better, had the government rolled them back in time. All political parties unanimously opposed these bills and demanded they be rolled back. When I was leader of opposition, I had said that we make laws for people, but if people don’t want a law, then it serves no purpose. I wish the PM and BJP-led NDA government had taken this decision one-and-a-half years ago because many lives that were lost in dharnas in winters and summers, could have been saved,” he said. “Had it been done earlier, the Parliament would also have maintained its ‘maan smaan’ (sanctity) and these lives would not have been lost,” he added. “At the same time, we can’t condemn this decision and we welcome it but with a heavy heart,” he said. “Ensuing elections obviously played a role in the repeal of these farm laws…I need not tell that. I would say that elections only played the role but ultimately government has accepted to withdraw these bills,” he responded to a query. He said that it should not be viewed as victory or defeat. “We always say that government should not make it an issue of prestige. The will of the people is supreme. A bill was also rolled back during Rajiv Gandhi’s tenure but the demand of repealing farm laws was not of a particular religion or region. It is good that the BJP government has rolled these back,” he said. Azad also downplayed his removal from the party’s disciplinary committee. AICC president Sonia Gandhi on Friday dropped him from the disciplinary panel. Many believe that Azad’s removal from the panel was the fallout of the resignation letter sent by 20 J&KPCC leaders to Sonia Gandhi. All the 20 leaders were Azad loyalists in the faction-ridden J&K PCC. Downplays removal from disciplinary committeeWhen asked whether party high command wants to “discipline” those who want a change within the Congress, Azad said, “Well, I have been in the disciplinary panel for quite a long time. I remained in it for five years during Rajiv Gandhi’s tenure around 36 years ago. And I was in this committee also for over a decade. This isn’t some committee, which meets every day. It meets once in two years or once a year. I think for the last one-and-a-half years, there was no meeting (of this panel). So, this is (his removal) not something big.” When asked to react to BJP’s promise of having uniform civil code in the country, Azad said that such issues should not be discussed at the time of elections. “Well let’s not discuss all these issues at the time of elections, which are going to be held in the next two months. We should not raise such issues, which divide the nation and government should also neither think nor do any such thing that divides the nation,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ghulam-nabi-azad-welcomes-repeal-of-farm-laws-says-move-should-have-come-earlier-101637330472491.html
19-11-2021||Lucknow||Two-year jail for Aligarh BJP MLA in 22-year-old case||Sitting BJP MLA of Aligarh City Sanjeev Raja was on Thursday sentenced to two years imprisonment for thrashing a traffic police constable in Aligarh 22 years ago.Additional district judge in Aligarh Manisha (who goes by one name) also slapped a penalty of ₹14,000 on the MLA but granted him bail till the time appeal by him was accepted in the high court.The case was registered against the MLA for thrashing traffic police constable Shyam Sundar on November 17, 1999 in Aligarh. Shyam Sundar, deputed at Ganda Nala area of Aligarh, had stopped a driver of vehicle carrying building material from entering into Aligarh city and asked him to go through by-pass but driver moved on in the city area.As the constable chased the vehicle, the driver told him that the vehicle belonged to Sanjeev Raja who later turned up and along with the driver thrashed the constable. Sundar lodged a complaint on November 17 at Banna Devi police station in Aligarh where case was registered against Raja and driver of vehicle under sections 147, 332, 353, 504, 506 of Indian Penal Code.The counsel of accused pleaded that it was first crime of Raja, who is presently the MLA from Aligarh city, and was serving the masses thus he should be sentenced with minimum punishment.When contacted, Raja said he was from BJP, the party that always respects court’s order.“I will also respect the court’s order. I will appeal before a higher court,” said Raja.When asked if this conviction will affect his future candidature for assembly elections, he said “I am prepared to face the consequences.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/twoyear-jail-for-aligarh-bjp-mla-in-22-year-old-case-101637330412320.html
19-11-2021||Pune||Pune astronomers claim discovery of 8 MRP class of stars using GMRT||A group of astronomers at the National Centre for Radio Astrophysics (NCRA) in Pune claim to have discovered eight stars belonging to a rare class called “MRPs”, or, Main-sequence Radio Pulse Emitters.The discovery was made using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) located near Pune. The team had discovered three such stars in the past using the GMRT. Thus, of the total of 15 MRPs known so far, 11 were discovered with the GMRT, of which eight have been discovered in 2021 alone.The bandwidth and high sensitivity of the upgraded GMRT is being cited as the key behind these discoveries. A research paper describing the new discoveries has been accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal. The lead author of the paper is Barnali Das, who recently completed a PhD, working under the supervision of Prof Poonam Chandra at the NCRA’s Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Pune. Barnali Das and Prof Chandra have been actively involved in various projects aiming at the characterisation of this little-known class of MRPs. “The MRPs are stars hotter than Sun with unusually strong magnetic fields, and much stronger stellar winds. Due to this, they emit bright radio pulses like a lighthouse. Though the first MRP was discovered in 2000, it was only due to the high sensitivity of the upgraded GMRT (uGMRT) that the number of such stars is known have increased many fold in recent years, with 11 of the 15 being discovered using the GMRT. The success of the survey with the uGMRT suggest that the current notion that MRPs are rare objects may not be correct,” said lead author Das. In fact, the name MRP was introduced by them in the year 2020. In an effort to understand their properties, they have performed the most extensive study of MRPs over an ultra-wide frequency range, using two of the world’s leading radio telescopes: the GMRT and the US- based Karl G Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). Their work, for the first time, showed that the radio pulses emitted by MRPs contain a vast amount of information regarding the stellar magnetosphere. “The pulsed radio emission from MRPs are the only visible signatures of the theoretical models which predicts tiny explosions in magnetic massive stars which occur at specific locations in the magnetosphere of the star. These explosions have been predicted to play an important role in regulating the transport of wind materials surrounding the star, and are likely to affect the stellar evolution as well. The radio pulses produced by MRPs are the only probes that are sensitive enough to reflect the changes incurred by these relatively weak events. Further experiments are underway to characterize these changes in pulse-behavior so as to be able to use the radio pulses to study the dynamic stellar magnetospheres.” added Das. Prof Chandra said, “This is the frequency range where the uGMRT stands out as the most sensitive telescope in the world. The high sensitivity of the uGMRT and its ability to make high-resolution images were instrumental in enabling the recovery of the pulsed signal from the different types of radiation coming from the sky. This, combined with a strategic observation campaign allowed the astronomers to overcome the difficulties, and reveal the true nature of these objects. The study with the uGMRT allowed us to find that the magnetic field and temperature are two quantities that appear to play the major role in deciding how intense the radio pulse will be. These findings will be crucial in understanding what switches off the production of radio pulses in a hot magnetic star.”The GMRT is a radio telescope located at Khodad, 80 km away from Pune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-astronomers-claim-discovery-of-8-mrp-class-of-stars-using-gmrt-101637329689614.html

The image depicts hotpots with small red dots. The entire area around the national capital is seen with high levels of air pollution.The images were taken by Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the Suomi NPP satellite on November 11, Nasa informed on its blog.Smoke from crop fires in northern India blanketed Delhi and contributed to soaring levels of air pollution. https://t.co/Pe30imj6xV pic.twitter.com/RyNEmVcbXx“Looking at the size of the plume on November 11 and the population density in this area, I would say that a conservative estimate is that at least 22 million people were affected by smoke on this one day,” said Pawan Gupta, a Universities Space Research Association (USRA) scientist at Nasa's Marshall Space Flight Centre.It further said that fires in northern Pakistan could also have contributed some of the smoke.Delhi's air quality continues to remain in the 'very poor' category for the sixth consecutive day on Friday, according to the System of Air Quality & Weather Forecasting & Research (SAFAR).However, the overall Air Quality Index reduced from 362 on Thursday to 332 today.According to the SAFAR bulletin, Delhi's AQI will remain the same for the next two days.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate', 201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'.The entry of trucks in Delhi except those carrying essential commodities has been stopped till November 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/shot-of-smoke-for-delhi-nasa-photo-shows-how-farm-fires-added-to-pollution-101637294663048.html
19-11-2021||Dehradun||Haridwar logs tourist influx of nearly 1.2 million, highest after Mahakumbh||After Mahakumbh held earlier this year which attracted nearly 9.1 million pilgrims, Haridwar witnessed the maximum tourist influx of 1.2 million on Friday on the occasion of Kartik Poornima and Guru Purab, with pilgrims thronging ghats since early morning to take a dip in the holy Ganga. Amid fears of a possible third wave of Covid-19 infections, the pilgrims could be seen flouting Covid-19 protocol without masks and with little regard for social distancing norms.During Mahakumbh in April also, pilgrims and seers had violated Covid-19 guidelines which had contributed to the spread of Covid-19 in Uttarakhand and led to a second wave in other states where pilgrims and tourists had returned. According to Senior Superintendent of Haridwar Police, Yogendra Singh Rawat the Kartik Poornima bath attracted around 12 lakh pilgrims from Kumaon division, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab and other states. “Elaborate security, traffic and pilgrim management measures were put in place. The whole Mela sector was bifurcated into 9 zones and 32 sectors. In the wake of a terror threat, 2 bomb disposal squads, sniffer squads, a mounted cavalry unit, Provincial Armed Constabulary and local intelligence unit personnel as well as traffic police personnel were deployed in the area. The police also urged pilgrims to adhere to standard operating procedures,” said Haridwar SSP Yogendra Singh Rawat. Elated over the record number of pilgrims, Ganga Sabha, which manages the affairs of the sanctum sanctorum of Brahamkund, Har-Ki-Pauri, said that the year-end bath has once again shown faith empowering fear. “Post the decline in Covid-19 cases and double vaccination progressing on war footing, pilgrims are now feeling much safer to venture to places of pilgrimage,” said Ganga Sabha president Pradeep Jha. Cautioning the government and people about a possible spike in Covid-19 cases, Anoop Nautiyal, founder of Social Development for Communities Foundation, who has been tracking the Covid-19 scenario for the past 2 years, said it was important that there should be no leniency in following basic Covid-19 guidelines. “The fight against Covid-19 should continue in an aggressive way amid fears that there could be a third wave. We should not be complacent. We have to ensure vaccination of all by yearend, increase testing and make sure people wear face masks and keep away from crowded areas,” he said “A spike in Covid-19 cases in Russia, China and southern states in India is an indicator that neither the government nor people should forget the dreadful scenario of the first and second Covid-19 wave. Prevention and vaccination need to be done together to avoid a third wave of Covid-19,” Nautiyal said. The trading community, however, seemed quite happy as post Mahakumbh for the first time in 7 months such a record number of pilgrims arrived in a single day in Haridwar. “Traders remained busy throughout the day. I hope Covid-19 soon goes away and normal life resumes here and we continue to serve pilgrims as we have always done,” said trader representative Tej Prakash Sahu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/haridwar-logs-tourist-influx-of-nearly-1-2-million-highest-after-mahakumbh-101637328009627.html

The CM called the withdrawal of the bills a “historic” gesture and congratulated the Prime Minister for making the decision.“Some farmers’ organizations had launched movement over the three farm laws and the government established communication with them at all levels. A big section of people believed that the farm laws could play an important role in increasing the income of farmers,” he said.“The government tried to have a dialogue with farmers. But maybe because of some deficiency on our part, we failed to explain farmers about the utility of the farm laws,” added the CM.He said the Prime Minister also announced to constitute a committee for the minimum support price. “The Uttar Pradesh government welcomes the decision,” said Adityanath.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/yogi-welcomes-decision-to-repeal-three-farm-laws-101637327289589.html

His soul must be at peace after this news,” she said.Gurmit Kaur (58), a resident of village Pipli Chak in Guruharsahai sub-division, said her husband Jarnail Singh (60) died due to cardiac arrest at the Singhu border in June this year."His sacrifice has finally paid off as the union government decided to repeal the agri-laws. I am so happy that farmers who were fighting for their rights have finally won on the sacred day (on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev," said Gurmit Kaur.Satnam Singh Pannu, Punjab state president of the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee, said this day will etched in history."We were not fighting for ourselves. We were fighting for the generations to come. Though we lost our few members, the entire nation will always be grateful to them," he said.In Bathinda, the families of those who died during the farmers' struggle recalled their personal losses.Gurmail Singh, whose 18-year-old son Jashan Preet Singh of village Chuke died of cardiac arrest at the Tikri border, said that he was happy that his son's sacrifice had not gone in vain."Today is the day of real happiness when my son's sacrifice is acknowledged," an emotional Gurmail Singh said.Sukhrimpy Singh said, “Farm laws had to be repealed. But I know I have lost my father in this struggle.”Singh's father Gurdas Singh Dhillon (68) of village Ghudda died in an accident in February this year.In Amritsar, the affected families welcomed the announcement but said it should have come earlier.Bhupinder Singh, who has recently lost his brother Gurbhej Singh of village Saidolehal at the Singhu border, said, "We welcome the decision of the PM, it's a good decision but it should have been done earlier so that many lives could have been saved.”"Many innocent farmers were killed during the agitation and they are martyrs for the farming community,” he said.Jagdish Singh who lost his brother Davinder Singh from village Maluwal during the stir at the Singhu border also hailed the announcement of repeal of the farm laws."We welcome this decision. But the government should have made this announcement earlier in order to save the lives of more than 700 farmers. Now it is the turn of the Punjab government to fulfil its promise of jobs to one family member of the farmers who died during the ongoing agitation,” he said.Punjab has remained the epicentre of the protests against the Centre's three farm legislations -- the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers' (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.In November 2020, farmers from Punjab and Haryana moved to the Delhi borders to press the central government to withdraw these laws.They have also been demanding a new law to guarantee the minimum support price (MSP) for crops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sacrifice-of-farmers-who-died-during-protests-pay-off-say-their-kin-101637323299746.html

19-11-2021||Bangalore||Citizens ridicule cleanliness award to Bengaluru City Corporation||Residents of Bengaluru are having a field day on social media after the city corporation was reported to be among eight other municipal bodies to have won a Union government-initiated award for cleanliness. “BBMP wins award for ‘keeping Bengaluru clean’ | This is the biggest joke on us citizens! A municipality who has failed to keep our city clean for decades wins an award? Citizens need to hold them accountable with rallies,” Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, the chairperson of Biocon Ltd said in a post on Twitter. The award was instituted in alignment with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of a garbage-free country under the Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban 2.0, according to a statement by the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs.The results will be formally announced at a ceremony to be attended by President of India, Ram Nath Kovind, on November 20. From surveying around 73 major cities in 2016, 4,320 cities have participated in 2021, according to the statement, which adds that it has become the world’s largest cleanliness survey. The Union government said that over 50 million people have been part of the citizen feedback survey which marked an increase from last year’s 1.87 crore. “The 2021 edition was conducted in record time of 28 days despite several on-ground challenges owing to the Covid-19 pandemic. There have been significant on-ground improvements in performance of states and cities, as compared to the previous year,” the statement added. The award comes at a time when unseasonal rains have exposed the fault lines in planning--or the lack of it-- by inefficient civic authorities including the BBMP which has continued to burden the common citizen of a city that aspires to get global status for its prowess in technology, start-ups, knowledge, biotechnology and aerospace among several other sectors. BBMP’s ineffective administration has led to flooding in almost all parts of the city due to the heavy rainfall, forcing motorists and pedestrians to bear the suffering of commuting on the poor quality of roads. Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai had said that the government had spent ₹2000 crore or just under $3 billion for road work over the last five years, with the civic authorities having nothing to show for it.Bengaluru generates around 5000 metric tonnes of garbage everyday but most of it is collected by civic workers with their bare hands and transported in unhygienic conditions to landfills or segregation centres. A significant portion of this garbage is left on roads, which raises the threat of infectious diseases especially considering the adverse impact after the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2020, Bengaluru won the best sustainable Mega City award.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/citizens-ridicule-cleanliness-award-to-bengaluru-city-corporation-101637322788772.html
19-11-2021||Mumbai||Kalyan Dombivli civic body to check if housing societies are implementing rainwater harvesting||The Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC), though, has given a No Objection Certificate (NOC) to 635 societies to carry out the rainwater harvesting five years ago, there is no record on how many residents have actually started the project.The civic body has now decided to take a status check in all these societies as to whether the project is installed and operational.KDMC officials will pay a visit to these societies to check the progress of the project. The NOCs were given in 2016-17, as per the KDMC records.“We will do a review of these societies to ensure the projects are set up after getting the NOC and are being operated as per the rules. The engineers of the water department of the ward offices have been asked to review these societies and prepare a report based on the findings. It will help in taking the necessary steps and make sure rainwater harvesting is practiced,” said Vijay Suryavanshi, commissioner, KDMC. The study will be carried out over the next few days.Pramod More, executive engineer, KDMC, said, “In many cases, even if the civic body has given the nod and the builder or developer has made the provision for rainwater harvesting, the residents of the society are not operating the project effectively. This is the reason why not many of the rainwater harvesting projects are successful. The status check will help give more insight to the same.”According to the KDMC, since 2016 till 2017, the water department has given NOC to 635 societies to carry out the rainwater harvesting. Out of these, 389 societies are in Kalyan and the rest in Dombivli.One society that has had a rainwater harvesting facility since the last 14 years in Kalyan is still effectively doing it. “Whatever amount of rainwater is collected in the terrace during the rainy days, it goes to the underground collection facility. This project has been undertaken for the last 14 years and is effectively done by the society,” said Sreeniwas Ghanekar, a resident of Om Shrikant Sadan building, Agra Road, Kalyan (W).In 2000, Lakshmi Niwas building located at Bhattacharya Chowk in Kalyan (W) was the first to carry out rainwater harvesting in Kalyan. A resident of the building, Upendra Karothia, 54, came up with the initiative to harvest rainwater and send it to a nearby dry well.“As the natural wells in the area were drying, I wanted to fill them up. This is how I decided to take up rainwater harvesting in my building. We collected the water from the terrace and through a pipeline, sent it to a nearby well that was dry. Every year, during the rainy season, the water is collected and sent to the well, which ultimately goes to the land and we manage to save water for the future,” said Karothia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/kalyan-dombivli-civic-body-to-check-if-housing-societies-are-implementing-rainwater-harvesting-101637322193983.html

19-11-2021||Mumbai||Bombay high court upholds look out circular against HK-based diamond trader||The Bombay high court on Wednesday dismissed a petition filed by a Hong Kong-based diamond trader questioning a look out circular issued against him by the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) as a result of which he was prevented from flying back to Hong Kong. A division bench of justice Nitin Jamdar and justice Sarang Kotwal dismissed the petition filed by Chaitya Shah, after it was informed that the non-resident Indian was linked to Gitanjali Gems Ltd of fugitive diamond trader Mehul Choksi, who is accused of defrauding Punjab National Bank of ₹7080.86 crore and also owes additional ₹5099.74 crore to a consortium of 32 banks. Shah, who has been residing in Hong Kong along with his family for the past nine years, had moved the Bombay high court stating that on September 10, 2020, when he and his family were leaving New Delhi for Hong Kong, he was stopped at the airport’s immigration check. Also Read: Nirav Modi UK extradition appeal to be heard on Dec 14He said the immigration officer put a stamp that read “cancelled without prejudice” on his passport and didn’t allow him to board the flight. He added that the next day, he received summons and was required to attend the Mumbai zonal office of the SFIO, which was probing the affairs of Choksi’s Gitanjali Gems. He said he was a bona fide investor who had purchased 6,802,896 convertible warrants of Gitanjali Gems worth ₹49.25 crore between January 2015 and August 2016. Subsequently, the warrants were converted into equity shares, which he sold in 2017 for ₹50.51 crore. Maintaining that the transactions were conducted through banking channels and had nothing to do with Choksi personally, Shah said his family and his Hong Kong-based diamond trading entity Chaitya Private Ltd had been suffering as he was not allowed to return to Hong Kong. He questioned the look out circular arguing that his liberty was curtailed because of the SFIO’s action and that he was illegally prevented from going out of the country. It was argued on his behalf that several persons who face prosecutions in India can travel abroad, but not the petitioner, although he hadn’t been accused of any offence. The Bombay high court, however, held that Shah’s presence in India was necessary for the probe into the affairs of Gitanjali Gems. The bench said the recourse to the look out circular was not unfounded as Shah had a connection with the SFIO investigation since he was directly involved and was concerned with considerable share-holding of Choksi’s Gitanjali Gems. “It involves a huge amount of almost ₹50 crore that requires serious explanation from the petitioner in the background of the allegations that the money belonged to Mr. Mehul Choksi, who has left India and has not returned. This transaction is an important part of the entire fraud involving a huge amount,” said the bench.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-high-court-upholds-look-out-circular-against-hk-based-diamond-trader-101637320688492.html
19-11-2021||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh to levy tax on fodder for conservation of cows: Shivraj Singh Chouhan||Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has directed the state authorities to chalk out a plan to impose tax on fodder for cows, which will help in the conservation of these animals, an official said on Friday. The chief minister gave this direction while chairing a review meeting of the Madhya Pradesh Gaupalan Evam Pashudhan Samvardhan Board (MP Cow Rearing and Livestock Promotion Board) on Thursday. "The chief minister said that a tax plan should be prepared for (procurement of) cow grass (fodder). Also, public participation should be encouraged for cow conservation," the official said. At the meeting, the CM asked the officials to make special arrangements to increase the sale of cow products by launching a massive publicity campaign. He said that phenyl made of cow urine should be used in government offices, an official statement said. The chief minister said the Kamdhenu Gau Abhyaranya, a cow sanctuary in Agar Malwa, 190 km north-west of Bhopal, developed by the MP Gau Samvardhan Board, should be turned into a model for the country and made the best national level cow sanctuary. Chouhan also said that the work of the development of gaushalas (cow shelters) in the state should be given to voluntary organisations. "The work of gaushalas is synonymous to service. Voluntary organisations can develop gaushalas well...," the release quoted Chouhan as saying. He directed the officials to provide grants to gaushalas run by non-government voluntary organisations. Chouhan also called for special efforts to improve the breed of cows in the state and underlined the need for research to increase the production of milk in cows. According to the 20th animal census of India conducted in 2019, there were more than 1.87 crore cows in the state, an official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/madhya-pradesh-to-levy-tax-on-fodder-for-conservation-of-cows-shivraj-singh-chouhan-101637319734113.html

19-11-2021||Dehradun||Rajnath Singh to visit Pithoragarh to participate in Shaheed Samman Yatra||Defence minister Rajnath Singh along with minister of state for defence Ajay Bhatt, will visit Pithoragarh on November 20, to participate in the Shaheed Samman Yatra, which will start from Jhualkhet village of the district. Ashish Chauhan, district magistrate, Pithoragarh said that the defence minister will reach Pithoragarh at 11.30 am on Saturday and after spending two hours watching the programme being organised at Jhualkhet, will leave for Bareilly at 2.15 pm. He said Rajnath Singh will be accompanied by MOS defence Ajay Bhatt and Almora Member of Parliament Ajay Tamta. The Shaheed Samman Yatra will take off from Pithoragarh district on Saturday. The Yatra will pay tribute to the sacrifices made by soldiers from Uttarakhand. Covering 70 blocks in 13 districts of the state, it will collect soil from the homes of 1734 martyrs till December 7. The soil will be then be used in the construction of Shainya Dham in Dehradun. In January this year, then chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat had laid the foundation stone of Shainya Dham in Dehradun’s Purkul village. Taking a cue from Prime Minister Narendra Modi terming Uttarakhand as Shainya Dham, the fifth dham after the traditional Char Dhams, Rawat in 2019 had announced that the state government would set up Shainya Dham in Dehradun. It will have details of the soldiers who laid down their lives for the nation. It will also house details of the rich legacy of soldiers from Uttarakhand and their contributions over the years. Last year, Rawat had made the announcement of setting up Shainya Dham while addressing a gathering of former servicemen at Shainya Sammelan organised as part of the government’s week-long state foundation day celebrations for which the theme was ‘Mere Sainik Mera Abhimaan’ (My soldiers, my pride). Prime Minister Narendra Modi during an election rally in Rudrapur in March 2019 had said that “Devbhumi Uttarakhand has Chardhams, but today I add a fifth one- Shainya Dham- as every second house in this state is of an army man.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/rajnath-singh-to-visit-pithoragarh-to-participate-in-shaheed-samman-yatra-101637319848220.html
19-11-2021||Pune||Global Village Idiot: Why the path to ‘finding your centre’ is a continuous process||I am sitting at my desk, rocking my legs continuously, as I am thinking and writing. Is rocking the right word to describe the constant shaking of one’s leg? Maybe not, but I don’t want to interrupt my thought process, so rocking it is. I am wired in, listening to Chris Rea’s iconic album, God’s Great Banana Skin.It was an instinctive, subconscious choice, but a deliberate one, as I realise now that am giving it a thought. This was the album I used to listen to the most back in the summer of 1992, when I was just out of Dadar Catering College, sitting at home for four straight months, accompanied by my classmate, friend, and brother-in-arm, Dmess. We had just completed a rigorous three-year programme in management, having studied and worked 9 am to midnight - more or less every day. Most of our classmates had jobs with leading hotels, cruise lines, startup airlines, or were setting up their own business or had signed up for the Master’s programme. We just sat at home and watched Star Sports and MTV all day, every day.Being a writer even back then, I wrote a lot and doodled a lot as well - diary entries, short stories, poems, business plans, marketing spiels, posters, travel itineraries, inventory and cost management models … anything that came to mind. And that’s where Chris Rea and God’s Great Banana Skin came into the picture - I used to wire into my Walkman and write. I had learned very quickly that listening to music is a great way to block out the world but a terrible way to focus your thoughts if you pick music that is catchy but new, which then means you’ll be engaging with the music and not writing. If I picked boring music or elevator music, well that just irritated me to the point of distraction and there was no writing that would happen in that mindset.Chris Rea is a British singer, songwriter, and guitar player who has a unique style that is deeply immersed in blues. I have been listening to Chris Rea for exactly three decades now. Never met him, but if I were to have been a musician, he is the kind of musician I would have wanted to be - because I identify with his work ethic. He has released 26 studio albums, one live album and seven compilation albums since his debut in 1978 - that’s 34 albums in 42 years in terms of productivity: and that’s apart from the sheer volume of concerts every year, not to mention the paintings he did. (I have 28 of the 34 albums). I usually pick one of the lesser-known earlier albums like Auberge or God’s Great Banana Skin as a companion when am writing long diary entries, especially those that require exploration and are likely to end up as unfiltered, stream-of-consciousness rambles (like this one) on existential matters. God’s Great Banana Skin more often because the title song is a reminder to not be so arrogant to think the world revolves around you.In terms of music, it is easy to label Chris Rea as a rock or blues-rock musician but he’s an artist (self-taught) whose work reflects his life. His triumphs, travails, feelings, opinions, ups and downs - it’s all there in his music (and I suspect in his paintings as well). Further, his musical style is uniquely his own because it is a product of his life.And that for me is what a definitive artiste stands for: one who puts their energies and opinion into their craft and produces work (under any and all circumstances) that speaks for itself and represents the artist’s take on the world (or on a universal or existential matter) at a given point in time. And this path, this method to always focus on channelising your energies into constructive work is what I call the continuous process of ‘Finding Your Centre.’ As a writer, I can admit that every time I get off that path, it leads to anxiety, frustration, anger and a whole universe of sundry other non-productive emotions.Naturally, I extend my viewpoint to beyond art and therefore believe - that under any and all circumstances - it is my job as a writer to write, as a designer to design, as a small business owner to manage risks to the business and so on. And that’s what I am doing now: focusing on my work - focusing on being a management person to the companies I am a part of; focusing on being a partner to my spouse, on being a father to our children, on being a son, a brother, a friend … focusing on all the different works that I am responsible for. And when I am doing what I have to do, it saves me the trouble of facing rational and irrational fears that come with being masked or being homebound (or not) or deciding whether to travel and how or not … fears of living in the pandemic-era world.I find that I am more peaceful if I don’t fret about what’s not in my control.Sanjay Mukherjee, author, learning-tech designer and management consultant, is founder of Mountain Walker and chief strategy advisor, Peak Pacific.

19-11-2021||Chandigarh||Leopard trapped fortnight after boy found dead in Shimla forest||Two weeks after a leopard mauled a five-year-old boy, Yograj, to death in Shimla’s Down Dale locality, the wildlife wing of the forest department managed to cage a wild cat suspected to be a man-eater. Also read: Repeal of farm laws to impact multiple proceedings in Supreme CourtYograj was lifted from outside his house on Diwali night and his mutilated body was found in the forest two days later, leading to widespread anger. The wildlife wing installed cages in different locations. Trap cameras were set up to track the movement of leopards in localities adjoining the forest areas, including Ramnagar, Kanlog, Tuttikandi, Down Dale and Fagli. Leopards straying into the human habitat is common in the localities adjoining the forest. The forest department’s trap cameras traced five leopards in the localities. “There is one female leopard with three cubs, while another fully grown leopard was on the prowl,” said Ravi Shankar, the divisional forest officer (wildlife), Shimla. The wildlife department had set up a cage in Kanlog locality. The leopard entered the cage on Thursday night and was trapped and later tranquilised. The animal was shifted to the rescue centre at Tuttikandi. “We are not sure whether this is the same leopard that attacked the child or a different one,” Shankar said. Three-and-a-half months ago, a leopard lifted and killed a girl in the locality. “Even in Down Dale, there is no streetlight for safety. We demand the government announce a compensation of ₹10 lakh each to the family members of the children killed in leopard attacks. Leopards have been spotted in Navbhar, Tottu, Kainthu and Ramnagar also,” former mayor Sanjay Chauhan said. The Shimla Nagrik Sabha has been protesting against the forest headquarters, demanding the authorities step up efforts to catch the leopard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/leopard-trapped-fortnight-after-boy-found-dead-in-shimla-forest-101637318228652.html

Fortunately, I’ve got another chance to represent my country, and this time I’m going to give it my best shot to win the title,” Sona said.The current Miss Tourism International titleholder is Brazil’s Maria Carolina Balicki Vinharski. Only two Indians have so far bagged the title - Candice Pinto in 2001 and Manasvi Mamgain in 2008.Sona, whose both parents are government school teachers, did her education in Guwahati and Bhubaneswar before working as a clinical instructor while also dabbling in modelling.Also Read: Juhi’s photo of Rekha crowning her Miss India resurfaces, fan says ‘great shot’“I like exploring new opportunities and new places.

We had to work for long hours and without leave. There was also the risk of getting infected by Covid-19 as we had to deal with patients,” she said.Due to Covid-related restrictions, this year’s Miss Tourism pageant will be held virtually, with contestants sending in their videos to the organisers.

19-11-2021||Chandigarh||PM’s move to repeal farm laws beginning of new chapter: Sidhu||Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu on Friday appreciated the announcement made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to repeal the three farm laws on the occasion of the Gurpurb of Sikhism founder Guru Nanak Dev and termed it the beginning of a new chapter. Also read: Repeal of farm laws to impact multiple proceedings in Supreme CourtAfter paying obeisance at the historic Gurdwara Ber Sahib and Hut Sahib in Sultanpur Lodhi on the 552nd birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev, Sidhu told the media: “Two major demands have been resolved this week. First, the Kartarpur Corridor was reopened and today the farm laws will be repealed. Punjab should forgive him (Modi). It is the beginning of a new chapter. He credited the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, the umbrella organisation of 32 farmer unions, and its satyagrah (peaceful protest) for the victory. “Despite attempts to malign and derail the protest, the SKM stood by the truth. The real challenge has just begun. We should have a roadmap for farmers to increase their income as land productivity has been dropping.” Sidhu said that only 1% of people were benefiting from state resources. “Politics has become a business as a result of which our younger generations are migrating to the West due to lack of opportunities. Punjab doesn’t have income as it can’t be run through loans,” he added. Sidhu’s aide and Punjab minister Pargat Singh said that it is a historic victory for farmers. “I congratulate farmers of the whole country for the repeal of farm laws. It is a historic victory for their tenacious struggle. Farmers and people of Punjab, Haryana and UP who led the struggle will always have their names inscribed in history.” The announcement of the repeal of the farm laws comes ahead of the crucial assembly elections in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur scheduled to be held early next year. Farmers from Punjab, Haryana and UP had arrived at the Delhi border on November 26, 2020, demanding the repeal of three farm laws: The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act; the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pms-move-to-repeal-farm-laws-beginning-of-new-chapter-sidhu-101637316308080.html

19-11-2021||Mumbai||Traffic congestion on Mumbai-Pune Expressway due to long weekend||Traffic on Mumbai-Pune Expressway slowed down to a crawl on Friday as a huge number of people from Mumbai and Navi Mumbai went on holiday because of the long weekend. Friday is a holiday due to Guru Nanak Jayanti. This, clubbed with routine offs on Saturday and Sunday, ensured many people a long weekend of three days. Thousands of residents of these cities packed their bags and left for places like Pune, Alibaug, Lonavala, and Mahabaleshwar to enjoy the long weekend. Many others left to their native places in Raigad, Satara, Ratnagiri among others.On Friday the problem started mainly near Khalapur, Khopoli, and some other places in Raigad.Subhash Pujari, assistant police inspector of the state highway traffic said, “The traffic movement is extremely slow as more and more vehicles entered the road after 7.30 am. The problem is mainly on the Mumbai-Pune lane as most of the people are travelling towards Pune. Therefore, we have stopped the heavy vehicles on the sides and allowed the passenger vehicles and cars to go first. For the heavy vehicles, we create ‘golden hours’ and allow them to go whenever the scenario improves. There is, however, no traffic congestion on the Pune-Mumbai lane. We have also deployed extra manpower to tackle the menace.”Another senior office from Raigad police said, “The Mumbai-Pune Expressway usually sees more traffic every Saturday and Sunday.

Also read: Govt to scrap agricultural laws, but farm protests to continueIn a video statement, he said, “We are happy that PM Narendra Modi has announced to repeal the laws on the auspicious occasion of Guru Nanak’s Parkash purb (birth anniversary). With this, the government has averted a tragedy that seemed to be looming over the Sikhs in the country.” Giani Harpreet Singh said that he was concerned that there were some outfits in the andolan (movement) that were sidelining the Sikh spirit and sentiments which played a key role in this agitation. “Under the garb of these three laws, efforts were being made to create communal divisions by mischievous elements. Some organisations have tried to strengthen their political base using this movement. They tried to weaken Sikh sentiments. They disliked the Sikh symbols appearing in the agitation,” he said. The jathedar said, “There were also some groups which tried to make this battle Sikh vs Indian Government. Not only this, nefarious attempts were also made to make it Sikhs vs Hindus. It would have yielded dire consequences for us in future, had these laws not been repealed.” “I wholeheartedly thank Prime Minister and his government as they have averted a tragedy that seemed to be looming over the Sikhs at the national level. The atmosphere that was being created was fatal for us. By announcing to repeal of the laws, the government has averted this atmosphere with the grace of God,” he said, adding, “We always want Sikhs to live safely in this country. The bond between Sikhs and Hindus is strong and it prevails at present. We have been making efforts to keep this bond strong forever. So, this move is appreciated.” Giani Harpreet Singh said, “No doubt, the loss of life in this agitation cannot be overcome. Besides, the community has paid the most to get these laws repealed. The Sikhs, especially those settled abroad, spent lot of money on this movement. The largest participation in this movement was of Sikhs. Sikhs have made their contribution in this agitation in all forms without taking care of their life and capital. The Government of India also knows this fact that particularly Sikh farmers were deeply disappointed over the three farm laws. That is why it has chosen the day of Parkash Purb of Guru Nanak to make this announcement.” Apex gurdwara body the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) has also welcomed this decision. “It is a blessing of Guru Nanak Sahib whose Gurpurb we are celebrating today, that the Prime Minister has announced to repeal these laws. Now, protesters will heave a sigh of relief as these laws have taken lives of farmers,” she said. “Punjab and Sikhs have had to pay a big price to get these laws repealed. Who is responsible for it? This is what we were asking the government to do. Yet, I thank the Prime Minister and also the Guru who made him realise the pain of the people,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/akal-takht-hails-repeal-of-farm-laws-says-tragedy-over-sikhs-averted-101637310608520.html
19-11-2021||Chandigarh||Defining moment in history: Parkash Singh Badal on repeal of farm laws||Five-time former Punjab chief minister and Shiromani Akali Dal patriarch Parkash Singh Badal on Friday described Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement on the withdrawal of the three farm laws as “a defining moment in history”, and said that it marks a historic day for farmers on the sacred day of Guru Nanak Dev ji’s Prakash Purb. Also read: Five ways in which repeal of farm laws impacts Punjab’s political dynamics“This is the greatest event in the history of farmer struggles all over the world. I thank the great Guru Nanak Devj ji Maharaj and congratulate every farmer working hard in his fields,” said Badal in a statement in Chandigarh. Claiming that farmers were not consulted before enacting these laws, the former chief minister said, “It was the first time in the history of democratic governments that brazen and cruel laws were made without even taking the stakeholders on board. No government should ever do such an insensitive and cruel thing again.” Badal said that PM Modi’s decision will have implications far beyond farmers and will have wide-ranging and long-lasting impact on the struggle for justice for the poor and deprived across the world. He, however, expressed regret over the loss of lives during the struggle. “My first thoughts go to their families. I wish they were here with us to see this day.” He said that tragic events such as the Lakhimpur Kheri violence will remain a blot on the face of the government. He urged central and state governments to stand by the families of the farmers who had died during the agitation and offer them liberal help in the form of government jobs and financial assistance. Advising the government to call leaders of farm organisations and political parties that represent farmers to suggest steps for their welfare, Badal said that justice for farmers is a cause to which his life has been dedicated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/defining-moment-in-history-parkash-singh-badal-on-repeal-of-farm-laws-101637308087388.html
19-11-2021||Chandigarh||‘It was a political compulsion’: SAD’s Naresh Gujral on repeal of farm laws||The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), which quit the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government at the Centre in protest against the three contentious farm laws, on Friday said the announcement for repealing the legislation is a “triumph of democracy”. It said the move will augur well for farmers in Punjab.SAD leader Naresh Gujral told HT that his party warned the government that the “my-way-or-the-highway” attitude will not work. “They did not heed our warning. We had told them not to underestimate the willpower of the famers, particularly the Jat Sikhs. What has happened today is the triumph of democracy.”The decision to repeal the three laws has been linked to elections in states including Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, where the farmers’ agitation gained much support.Also Read: Govt to scrap agricultural laws, but farm protests to continueGujral said the perception that the BJP has taken care to address a major grievance that the opposition could leverage against is not true. “Do not forget memories are long. Elections are only two months away. People will not forget, those who have suffered will not forget this. This was a political compulsion. They had to do it but I have doubts that it will yield them quick results,” he said.He said the SAD chose to walk away from the NDA because they could not support the BJP when the “farmers had been wronged”. After the farm bills were passed in Parliament in 2020, the SAD, one of the oldest allies of the BJP, quit the NDA and accused the government of not taking on board its concerns against the farm laws. “We are a farmers’ party. All our speeches in Parliament were about sending the bills to a select committee. We told them not to rush. But they were not willing to listen to us. We had no option [but to walkout],” he said.On the impact of the announcement on political formations in Punjab, given the overtures being made by former chief minister Amarinder Singh towards the BJP, Gujral said it was too soon to reach a conclusion. “In a democracy, everybody is free to do what they like. Both are on a weak wicket. So, let’s see how it pans out. Today’s announcement is not an aspirin that you take and the headache goes away immediately. Over 1,000 farmers have lost their lives. It’s been a struggle that has gone on for over a year, so I don’t see making this one announcement will change the entire political scenario,” he said. He also ruled out a reconciliation with the BJP. “Our core committee will meet to plan our future. Right now, I do not see in the immediate future any alignment with the BJP.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/it-was-a-political-compulsion-sad-s-naresh-gujral-on-repeal-of-farm-laws-101637306887318.html

Authorities informed that the fire broke out at 9:30 am at the special newborn care unit of the Goalpara civil hospital following which nurses and other staff there evacuated the babies immediately. “The fire started at one corner of the unit. It is not clear whether it was due to a short circuit or some waste material catching fire. The fire was immediately doused before it could spread,” said Dr Nil Madhab Das, joint director (health), Goalpara. “As soon as the fire started, the nurses present at the spot broke open a window and shifted the newborns out. All the babies are safe and have been admitted to newborn care units of private hospitals in Goalpara town for the time being,” he added. This is the second instance of fire at intensive care units for babies at government hospitals in Assam this month. On November 10, one ventilator of an intensive care unit (ICU) of a pediatric ward in Assam Medical College Hospital (AMCH) in Dibrugarh caught fire. The fire, which was caused due to short circuit, was immediately doused and all 10 newborns were moved to another part of the hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/fire-in-newborn-unit-of-assam-hospital-all-14-babies-moved-to-safety-101637305928031.html

19-11-2021||Chandigarh||Five ways in which repeal of farm laws impacts Punjab's political dynamics||The repeal of three contentious farm laws by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on Gurpurab (the 552nd birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev) is imbued with huge symbolism for Punjab, which was the epicentre of dogged farmers’ protests for more than a year. The surprise announcement is sure to impact the political dynamics in the poll-bound border state where the assembly election is slated for early next year. Here is how:1. Reprieve for BJP: A closure on the year-old agitation comes as a major breather for the saffron party, which was facing farmers’ ire on the ground in Punjab. The farm laws not only led to rupture of its 24-year-old poll alliance with the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), which walked out of the National Democratic Alliance government last year, but also made it the target of the wrath of the Sikh peasantry in rural Punjab. Now, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is expected to leverage Modi’s gesture, which came two days after the Centre’s move to reopen the Kartarpur corridor for Sikh pilgrims to Pakistan and regain the ground it lost in the Sikh constituency.2. Congress ups the credit war: The ruling Congress in Punjab, which has consistently opposed the farm laws and passed assembly resolutions rejecting the central legislation twice has been quick to claim credit for “forcing” the Modi government to relent. The Channi government, having already announced a string of populist announcements for rural votes, will make the rollback a centrepiece of its poll pitch in the assembly sweepstakes. In the opposition space, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Akalis will be competing with the Congress in crediting the farmers for “victory”.3. New political equations on the card: The repeal of the laws has opened possibilities of new political alignments and alliances in Punjab. It is a major relief for the Shiromani Akali Dal, which was smarting under the double whammy of the break-up of its alliance with the BJP and a backlash from its core constituency among peasantry for having initially supported the Modi government’s ordinances on farm reforms before the Parliament stamped them as laws. Desperate to be in poll reckoning, the Akalis had forged an alliance with the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), leaving 20 of 117 assembly seats to the junior partner. But, the elevation of Charanjit Singh Channi as Punjab’s first Dalit chief minister negated the SAD’s caste card through the BSP. The Akalis can now hope to recover the political ground they lost in their traditional bastion of farmers. But, the key question in Punjab now is: will the SAD and the BJP warm up to each other and again forge an alliance that once welded the Sikh and Hindu constituencies in an electorally formidable way? Political analysts don’t rule that out this possibility.4. Clears the way for Captain-BJP tie-up: The repeal of farm laws opens up the window for a poll tie-up between breakaway Congress leader and former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh who has floated a new party Punjab Lok Congress and hinted at seat-sharing with the BJP in case there is a resolution of the farm issues. Though Captain’s party is yet to take off, he still has political heft and appeal in both rural and urban pockets of Punjab and will be hoping to woo disgruntled Congress leaders to dent the party he was pushed out of unceremoniously.5. X-factor of farmer organisations: The 32 bodies comprising the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), most of them rooted in Punjab, will be in a triumphant mode over the repeal of the farm laws. But, will they take the electoral plunge to cash in on their victory? So far, they have ruled out contesting polls.But, some of the SKM constituents, named the Rajewal faction of the Bhartiya Kisan Union, are known to harbour political ambitions and are likely to be wooed by the Congress and the AAP. Farmer unions, buoyed by the success of their tenacious agitation, will be an X-factor at the Punjab hustings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/five-ways-in-which-repeal-of-farm-laws-impacts-political-dynamics-in-poll-bound-punjab-101637303407099.html

Also read: ‘It’s a beginning’: Tikait says won’t return until laws repealed in ParliamentHaryana has borne the brunt of the farmers’ agitation for the past one year as the protesters have been camping on the Delhi border at Singhu and Tikri, demanding the repeal of the farm laws. In his address to the nation amid Gurpurb celebrations on the occasion of Sikhism founder Guru Nanak Dev’s 552nd birth anniversary, Modi announced that the three farm laws will be repealed in the coming winter session of Parliament. Reacting to the news, state home minister Anil Vij released a video on social media and said, “With Prime Minister Modi announcing that the Centre has decided to repeal the three farm laws, all farmer unions should thank the PM for this decision and call off their agitation. They should go back to their homes and resume their routine work.” Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala said the decision should be seen as a gift from the Prime Minister to protesting farmers on Gurpurb. He also appealed to the protesting farmers to return to their homes. Dushyant, who is the leader of the Jannayak Janata Party, a BJP ally in the state, told PTI, “I appeal to all protesting farmers to return to their homes and celebrate Gurupurb with their families.” Former Haryana chief minister and leader of opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda also welcomed Modi’s decision. “Better late than never. Now, the government should give a legal guarantee on the minimum support price (MSP) outside the mandis (grain markets),” he said. Haryana Congress president Kumari Selja congratulated farmers and tweeted: “After a long time, the arrogant BJP government had to bow down before the sacrifice of several farmers. Each word said by (Congress leader) Rahul Gandhi about black laws proved true today. Congratulations to every farmer and labourer.” Reacting to the PM’s decision, INLD general secretary and Ellenabad MLA Abhay Singh Chautala, said, “This is the farmers’ win against an arrogant government, whose leaders claimed that these laws can’t be repealed but can only be amended. The farmers have forced the government to take back the three black laws. Now, the government should give a legal guarantee on the MSP, besides giving compensation to deceased farmers ‘ families, a government job and all facilities which are provided to a slain soldier. The farmers died while fighting against these black laws and the central government should give them martyrs’ status.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/haryana-bjp-jjp-leaders-urge-farmers-to-call-off-protest-after-pm-s-announcement-101637300587005.html
19-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s North Corporation doctors take to protesting again for their salaries||Doctors at hospitals run by Delhi’s North Corporation face salary delays again, with the residents not having received their salaries for three months. The doctors also said that they haven’t received the revised dearness allowance for six months. The resident doctors from Hindu Rao hospital, the largest one under the civic body, which also has an attached medical college, were to go on an indefinite strike Thursday onwards but deferred it keeping in mind a large number of dengue patients at the hospital. “This month there was Diwali and even then we were not paid. To show our protest, we are continuing with a pen-down strike for three hours each day. But, we have deferred an indefinite strike as the patients are the ones who suffer. We hope that we get paid by next week so we do not have to take such a step,” said Dr Chinna Dua, joint secretary of the resident doctors’ association of Hindu Rao hospital. However, it is not just the residents, senior doctors from all five hospitals run by the corporation, the dispensaries, polyclinics, maternity clinics, and TB clinics will also go on a strike after Wednesday next week having not been paid for over two months. Their revised dearness allowance is also pending. “Not only have they not paid us for two months, now going on three, they haven’t increased the dearness allowance as per the Centre’s directive. What is worse is that the corporation has diverted funds from the general provident fund which is our savings. If we want to withdraw our own savings in the time of need, we cannot,” said Dr RR Gautam, president of the Municipal Corporation Doctors’ Association. He said, the regular payment of salaries has been a long-standing issue at the north corporation and should be resolved. “The hospitals must be handed over to the Delhi or Central government if they are unable to pay our salaries. We should not have to protest every year to get our salaries,” said Dr Gautam. Last October, the doctors went to strike over non-payment of salaries. “Despite being promised multiple times in the past, salary delay issues are persistent at Hindu Rao hospital, Delhi, which is affecting the financial and day-to-day needs of the residents of this hospital. The situation has been brought to the notice of the concerned hospital many times, however, no concrete action has been taken and the problem has become repetitive,” the doctors wrote in their letter to the nion health minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-north-corporation-doctors-take-to-protesting-again-for-their-salaries-101637299029038.html

An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.Union earth sciences ministry’s System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research said the AQI was likely to improve but remain in the same category for the next two days as transport-level winds were coming from the east preventing intrusion of any pollutants from the stubble burning region. “Local surface winds are low and mixing layer height is above 1 km resulting in moderate ventilation of near-surface pollutants. From 21st (Sunday) onwards surface winds are likely to be strong resulting in effective dispersion that improves air quality.” It said the effective farm fire count was 773 and its contribution to Delhi’s PM2.5 was negligible.India Meteorological Department said the maximum temperature will reach 27 degrees Celsius on Friday. The minimum temperature on Thursday was 11 degrees Celsius and maximum of 27 degrees Celsius.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-air-quality-in-very-poor-category-101637292366799.html
19-11-2021||Delhi||Gopal Rai says 69% air pollution due to sources outside city||Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai on Thursday urged his Union government counterpart to hold a meeting and formulate a joint action plan to tackle sources of pollution in the National Capital Region (NCR) that were impacting Delhi.Citing data from a Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) analysis carried out for the period between October 24 and November 8, Rai said local sources contributed only 31% of the pollution load in Delhi and the remaining 69% originated the NCR towns. Rai also referred to a 2018 TERI source apportionment study which found that local sources were responsible for 36% of the total air pollution in Delhi.According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data, Delhi has witnessed the second worst post-Diwali pollution episode since 2015 when the AQI record keeping began. The city recorded its worst pollution spell in 2016 when a dense smog had enveloped the city. The state government announced emergency measures on Saturday, but only after a nudge by the Supreme Court and the pollution levels hitting severe levels.So far, only meteorological factors -- mostly improved wind speed -- has helped flush out pol-lutants in the city.CSE carried out its analysis using Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology’s (IITM) Decision Support System (DSS). It found that for the two weeks , Delhi’s own sources of pollution contributed to 31% of its total PM 2.5 load, 54.5% came from 19 nearby NCR districts and the remaining 14.5% was from stubble burning.The minister added that the state government has been trying to meet the Union environment minister and discuss the importance of preparing a joint action plan for NCR.“The Delhi government has constantly been working to reduce the pollution from Delhi. But no matter how hard the people of Delhi try, controlling the 70% external pollution is out of their hands. Therefore, I have repeatedly requested the union environment minister to have a meeting to frame a joint action plan. Until we formulate this plan and set in place teams to monitor its implementation, Delhi and its people will not be free from pollution.” he added.Commenting on the study, an expert said the contribution of local sources doe not remain constant, and it keeps changing depending on the meteorological conditions.Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy at CSE, who was also part of the analysis, explained,”During this two-week period, the contribution of Delhi’s own sources was 30%. But this can change, and it may go up to 70%. The point we are trying to make is that there is a need to work on the region as a whole, as Delhi’s pollution impacts NCR and vice-versa,” she said.Sachin Ghude from IITM, who is handling the DSS, said the contribution of external sources may vary at different times of the year.“There is a possibility that dust winds are coming from north-western India and outside Delhi. There is also a lot of trans-boundary movement of pollutants within NCR states as the area is one large airshed,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/gopal-rai-says-69-air-pollution-due-to-sources-outside-city-101637272528604.html

Dr Adarshpal Kaur, civil surgeon, Mohali, said, “The maximum deaths were reported in May this year as it was the peak of the disease. Now, the cases and deaths have drastically come down, but we are requesting people to come for their second dose of vaccination as we fear the third wave.” Nodal officer Dr Harmandeep Kaur Brar, said, “The sampling in the district has not decreased and we have ensured round-the-clock availability of the sampling team at the district hospital.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid-claimed-more-lives-in-mohali-urban-areas-101637271664879.html
19-11-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh’s AQI turns poor for few hours due to western disturbance||With a western disturbance active in the city on Thursday, the air quality index (AQI), which had remained below 200 since the day after Diwali, November 5, went past 200 for a few hours on Thursday. The effects of the western disturbance are likely to stay for about a day more as per the India Meteorological Department (IMD).At the Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Station (CAAQMS) in Sector 22 the average AQI for 24 hours went up from 181 at 12 noon to 245 at 1:00 pm on Thursday. It peaked at 278 at 2:00 pm and came below 200 at 5:00 pm.Speaking about this, IMD Chandigarh director Manmohan Singh said, “North westerly winds blowing in the region had kept the air quality from going bad due to the city’s unique location at the foothills of Himalyas. With western disturbances (WD), the effect of easterly winds takes over, which affected the air quality of the city.” Even during Diwali, these winds had cleaned the city’s air in a matter of hours from severe to the moderate bracket.Between 200 and 300, the AQI is considered poor and causes breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure. The effects of the WD will also continue on Friday so similar worsening in the air quality of the city can be expected.The air quality was poorer in centrally located station of Sector 22. AQI remained below 120 at the CAAQMS in Sector 25 which is located more towards the periphery of the city.The warmer easterly winds also affected the minimum temperature of the city. Minimum temperature went up from 10 degrees on Wednesday to 10.9 degrees on Thursday. Maximum temperature meanwhile went down from 26.7 degrees on Wednesday to 26.2 degrees on Thursday. Although rain will remain unlikely because of the WD, minimum temperature can rise upto 12 degrees in the next three days while maximum temperature is likely to stay around 26 degrees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhs-aqi-turns-poor-for-few-hours-due-to-western-disturbance-101637271604102.html

19-11-2021||Chandigarh||This government ‘smart’ school in Mohali has a single teacher for all classes||Declared a smart school two years ago, the Government Elementary School in Bhikandi village of Majri block in Mohali, has been functioning with just one teacher for over 80 students for the last five months. Till July this year, the school had three teachers. Two of them were transferred, leaving the lone teacher to take care of all classes (up to Class-5). The school doesn’t even have a headmaster, so the administrative duties also fall upon this lone teacher.Nirmal Singh, a village resident and a parent, said, “The only teacher here goes from one class to another, haphazardly covering bits and portions of the syllabus, leaving the students confused.”He added, “Even though the Right to Education Act mandates provision of a primary school (up to Class 5) within 1km of the village’s area and an upper primary school (up to Class 8) within 3km, children of Bhikandi are forced to travel 8km for classes beyond Class 5. The nearest senior secondary school is 12km away, due to which girls often drop out after Class 10 and sometimes, even boys don’t pursue education beyond Class 12.”Village sarpanch Pal Singh said, “We have written to the authorities concerned several times but to no avail. Last year, our children suffered due to the pandemic, this year, the lack of teachers is going to affect their studies.”Mohali district education officer (DEO, primary), Baljinder Singh said, “There is a shortage of teachers, but our recruitment process is in process. We will be sending teachers to the said school by next week.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/this-government-smart-school-in-mohali-has-a-single-teacher-for-all-classes-101637270044028.html
19-11-2021||Chandigarh||Contractor seeks double fare to ply whole fleet of Ludhiana buses||Amid the continuing deadlock between the city bus contractor and the municipal corporation officials over the limited number of city buses plying on the roads, the contractor has proposed to deploy the entire fleet of 83 buses, provided the fare is doubled. The proposal was tabled during a meeting of the contractor, Jaskirat Singh, and additional commissioner Aaditya Dachalwal at the civic body’s Zone-A office on Thursday. Citing the rising price of diesel, the contractor has proposed ₹10 for a 5-km journey, ₹19 for a distance of 5 to 10km, ₹29 for 10-15km and ₹1 per kilometre beyond it. At present, the fare is ₹5 for 5km, ₹10 for 10km, ₹15 for 15km and ₹20 for a distance of 20km. A final call will be taken by senior officials, including mayor Balkar Sandhu and MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal. The contractor said diesel was priced at ₹48 per litre when they entered into a contract with the municipal corporation in 2015. However, the rates had now almost doubled due to which it was difficult to run the buses without increasing the fare.The officials’ grouse is that the contractor has been merely running a dozen buses on two routes. However, the contractor has refused to run more buses, citing losses, a claim which authorities are sceptical about, resulting in the deadlock. The authorities have also demanded that the contractor clear his dues, amounting to ₹3 crore. Buses are the only public transport in the city. Of the 120 buses purchased under the project, 83 have been handed over to the contractor. Of these, only a dozen are running on city roads, while the others are gathering dust at the depot. The 37 buses with the MC are also stabled. In a nutshellThe contractor says the rate of fuel has almost doubled, necessitating revision of fare. Distance Present fare Proposed fare 5km ₹5 ₹10 10km ₹10 ₹1915km ₹15 ₹29||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/contractor-seeks-double-fare-to-ply-whole-fleet-of-ludhiana-buses-101637269924062.html
19-11-2021||Chandigarh||High court tells Chandigarh not to notify MC election schedule till November 23||The Punjab and Haryana high court (HC) has told Chandigarh administration not to notify the schedule of municipal corporation (MC) elections till November 23.The oral directions were given by the bench of justice Ritu Bahri and justice Karamjit Singh while hearing pleas against the reservation roster notified by UT on October 19.The UT administration on Thursday failed to respond to the plea filed by one Shiv Kumar on October 27 even as matter was adjourned from Wednesday to Thursday while asking UT to file its response. During the resumed hearing on Thursday, it came to light that the counsel who was appearing in the matter was suddenly changed. The new lawyer, who appeared before the court could not file a response even as petitioners contended that it was being delayed deliberately and notification for December polls could be issued anytime now and in view of that the plea would become infructutous.The court took serious note of the matter and called for Anil Mehta, the counsel who was appearing till Wednesday, and also summoned Legal Remembrance (LR), Vijay James to the court for afternoon hearing. The LR and other officials then were asked as to why an affidavit, clarifying as to how the population has been adjusted while increasing the number of wards from 26 to 35, has not been filed for which order was issued on November 9. It was also asked as to how response has not been filed to the plea filed on October 27.In view of this, the court while posting the matter for November 23 has asked UT to respond to the issues raised and not to issue formal notification till then. “Detailed order is awaited. However, during the proceedings, the court orally asked Chandigarh administration not to issue the notification for polls,” Mehta added.It is to be recalled here that UT does not have a senior standing counsel, the top law officer in high court on civil side since October 28, after elevation of justice Pankaj Jain as additional judge of HC. The cases are assigned to different lawyers by the Senior Standing Counsel. However, in the case in hand, the decision to change the counsel was taken by administration on Wednesday, a day before the hearing.There are two pleas on the issue one filed by Shiv Kumar, a resident of sector-42 on October 25 and second plea filed on November 17 by one Dhanas resident, Prem Pal. The pleas argue that reservation of wards notification should be done after excluding the population of the colonies not existing presently or partly demolished. It demands fresh notification on reservation of wards. The polls are slated for mid-December and tenure of MC ends on December 31. The officials had been maintaining that the notification would be issued by November 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/high-court-tells-chandigarh-not-to-notify-mc-election-schedule-till-november-23-101637269685118.html

The study will also focus on suggesting alternative eco-friendly transport system for the city.Roping in the UK technical assistance is part of the UT administration’s fresh move to have a comprehensive mobility plan for the city. Complimenting the UK study, which will focus on the city, another study, to be conducted by the Rail India Technical and Economic Services (RITES), will cover the entire tricity and explore different Mass Rapid Transit System (MRTS) options for the city.“The UK-funded study will provide support for de-carbonising the city’s transport and contribute towards the climate change agenda. The study will also focus on suggesting alternative eco-friendly transport system for the city,” said a senior UT official.The study aims to deliver a ‘concept report for Chandigarh’ which will include an “As is Scenario” of city transportation. It will highlight the socio-economic profile, traffic, transportation characteristics, emission levels and also the key challenges and areas of intervention for de-carbonisation and EV transition. Under the UK study, a detailed road map will be prepared to increase the uptake of e-mobility. Also, under the project, action plan and timelines for roll out will be created. Industry-government engagement to deliberate on roadmap will be done.The project also includes a component of city twinning with a UK city. A framework for city twinning, based on the priorities of both sides and knowledge exchange visits, between cities will be carried out. The inception of the idea for UK technical assistance happened during the meeting between the UT adviser Dharam Pal and the British deputy high commissioner Caroline Rowett over a month ago.On Thursday, the administration was informed that UK government has given “in-principle” approval to the project. The adviser gave his concurrence to the study after a meeting with DHC representatives.In a meeting, various aspects of the scope of the study to be conducted were discussed.

The project will be implemented by ICF consultingALL MRTS OPTIONS ON TABLE Commenting on the RITES report, Pal, said, “The studies will examine which is the best MRTS model for the city. It can also be a hybrid model incorporating different systems like monorail, light metro for the city and metro for the tricity.” After years in cold storage, the mass rapid transport system (MRTS) plans were revived in August this year by the administration after it decided to go in for a fresh study on the comprehensive mobility plan for the city.The earlier RITES report, prepared more than a decade ago, was found to be outdated as the city’s requirements changed drastically during this period and also, the guidelines set by the Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry of the MRTS project changed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/uk-to-assist-chandigarh-in-developing-sustainable-mass-transit-system-101637268783967.html

The Beas station house officer (SHO) initiated a probe and Prabhjit’s body was found from the canal subsequently. A case under Section 302 (murder) was registered against unidentified person(s) after the recovery of the body. Senior superintendent of police (rural) Rakesh Kaushal said, “We found in our probe that Prabhjit had been in contact with the three suspects who are drug addicts. They were questioned on the basis of suspicion. On August 22, the trio accused took drugs along with the victim. The accused revealed that after taking drugs, the victim’s condition deteriorated and he died. They threw his body in the canal out of fear.” The accused will be produced in court seeking their police remand for further questioning, the SSP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/three-arrested-for-killing-18-year-old-amritsar-youth-101637266984223.html
19-11-2021||Chandigarh||2 years on, Guru Nanak museum, Smart City works fail to take shape in Sultanpur Lodhi||A museum on Guru Nanak and several development projects under the Smart City project announced by the Punjab government on the first Sikh master’s 550th birth anniversary in 2019 have failed to move beyond the procedural or tendering process even after 2 years. The 552th birth anniversary of the Guru Nanak will be celebrated on Friday. Officials said the Punjab government had set up a seven-member of committee for conceptualising the central-sponsored project to build the museum, Pind Babe Nanak Da, a replica of Rai Bhoi Di Talwandi (now in Pakistan), the village where Guru Nanak was born. It took the state two years to get in-principle approval from the Centre for setting up the museum in April this year following which the Punjab government floated tenders to hire a consultancy firm to design the museum. Shiv Dullar Singh Dhillon, a former IAS officer who is supervising the project, said, “We did not find a suitable consultant for the project and have floated a tender for the same again. The Punjab government has promised to build the best museum for the devotees. Kapurthala deputy commissioner Deepti Uppal said the administration has completed the process to acquire the land for the museum but they are yet o receive funds from the tourism department. “At least 43-acre land was identified at Macchijova and Taraf Hazi villages in Sultanpur Lodhi for acquisition,” Uppal added. Many projects still in tendering stage In February this year, the then Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh initiated development works worth ₹134.18 crore under the Smart City project for Sultanpur Lodhi to strengthen the basic infrastructure and road connectivity to facilitate the pilgrims. Under the Smart City project, two main roads, including the one connecting Kapurthala and Sultanpur Lodhi via Fatudhinga will to be made 4 lane at a cost of ₹77 crore. Also, the Dadwindi-Sultanpur Lodhi road will be widened at ₹26 crore.Besides, the construction of parks and open spaces along the banks of the holy Bein will be undertaken at ₹26 crore. Also, a fire-control facility is to be set up with the latest technology at ₹2 crore. Congress’ Sultanpur Lodhi MLA Navtej Singh Cheema said that the installation of solar panels at government offices is almost at completion stage whereas the work on sewage treatment plants was underway. “We admit that there has been delay in the implementation of the projects, especially the museum. The public works department (PWD) has floated tenders for the two road projects and work will soon start,’ he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/2-years-on-guru-nanak-museum-smart-city-works-fail-to-take-shape-in-sultanpur-lodhi-101637266806319.html
19-11-2021||Chandigarh||Darkness reigns in Ward 11 of Chandigarh||If there is light at the end of the tunnel, this ward is in search of it—figuratively and literally. Having several dark stretches due to defunct streetlights, women of ward 11, which has a woman councillor, say they feel unsafe to venture out after sunset. A general ward, which includes Sectors 18, 19 and 21, residents here also complain of stray dog menace, poor sanitation and contaminated water supply. They also have grouse against councillor Asha Jaswal, who they claim, has barely ever visited their ward after winning the elections in 2017 and term her “highly unapproachable”.Bhupinder Singh Gill, president, residents’ welfare association (RWA), Sector 19-D said: “I will give zero marks to sanitation in this sector. Sanitation workers don’t collect garbage from parks. The municipal corporation has failed to manage its sanitation workers; as a result, the area is in a mess.”He added, “There was a community parking area near Maharashtra Bhawan but now instead of vehicles, you will find the space covered by 3-ft long wild grass.”Gill also raised the issue of contaminated water supply. Another resident from Sector 19-B said, “Asha Jaswal has never visited our sector to know the problems of residents. She came only once – during elections to seek votes. After winning, she stopped taking residents’ calls.”Pradeep Chopra, general secretary, Sector 21 RWA, said, “Basically, there is no coordination between the municipal corporation’s different departments. One team cuts grass and leaves it outside the park. The other department, which is supposed to collect it, visits after a gap of three to four days.” He added that by the time, the team comes to collect the horticulture waste left outside parks, passers-by also add to the garbage. “Our councillor had promised that an alternative place would be found for the meat and mechanics market, but that plan has never seen the light of the day,” Chopra added. RP Gupta, a businessman from Sector 18 market, said, “The president of the market association is from BJP, so he got a lot of work done with the support of Asha Jaswal. We are grateful for a lot of pending work that has been completed in the sector.”Kamaljit Panchi, general secretary, Sector 18 A, said, “A major problem in the sector is of stray dogs. Residents of all three sectors in this ward have complained about the menace. My wife and daughter have even stopped going for evening walks.”Another resident of Sector 18 said, “Streetlights in majority of the parks are lying defunct and several stretches get pitch dark after sunset. Even the stretch next to Tagore Theatre isn’t well lit. I feel like inviting the councillor and asking her to take a round of the sector at night. Perhaps, then, she might realise the problems being faced by women.”Asha Jaswal, councillor, said she had promised that she will not seek votes by apologising but by fulfilling the promise. “I have fulfilled all promises as mentioned in the manifesto. As far as the issue of stray dogs is concerned, I cannot do much as our hands are bound by the central government rules.”“I agree there is a delay in picking horticulture waste, but we are working on it and soon, the problem will be resolved. Electric lights have been repaired in most parks, except two or three. Those will be repaired too,” she said.Jaswal said she has been visiting the sectors, and holds meetings with residents. She said she has even made Whatsapp groups to take residents’ complaints and is quite accessible.KNOW YOUR WARD:Localities: Sector 18, 19, 21General ward15,000 votersKEY ISSUES:1.Defunct streetlights and dark stretches2.Poor sanitation2. Garbage dumps on footpaths next to parks3. Stray dogs4. Inaccessible councillorLocal voicesRL Goyal, resident, Sector 19 B: The main problem is lack of cleanliness. Trees are not pruned, parks are not maintained, garbage is not collected on time and areas behind houses are left unclean because of which water stagnates and vector-borne diseases like dengue spread. Jaswinder Sharma, resident, Sector 18: Nearly two months ago, I was attacked by stray dogs when I was about to enter a park next to our house. Even today, a stray dog growled at my maid’s daughter, who got too scared to enter her own house. Dr JC Verma, resident, Sector 21 A: Sanitation is a major issue. Earlier, the responsibility was with the RWA so it was managed well. The charges were less and garbage was collected from houses regularly. Now, the workers come on their own time. They come after several days to collect garbage from sectors. Kuldeep Singh Gill, sector 21 B resident: RWA should be allowed to take care of the cleanliness of the sector as the MC has failed to do so. There was a broken “rehri” parked in one of the parks. After permission, I spent ₹2,000 on it and started using it for collecting garbage. But one day, the councillor asked me to return that repaired vehicle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/darkness-reigns-in-ward-11-of-chandigarh-101637266625071.html

19-11-2021||Chandigarh||Channi govt in Punjab betrayed farmers by not fulfilling loan waiver promise: AAP||Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA and leader of opposition Harpal Singh Cheema on Thursday hit out at the Charanjit Singh Channi-led Congress government in Punjab for “betraying the farmers” by not fulfilling the party’s pre-poll promise of complete loan waiver. Cheema said the Congress had promised in writing on January 19, 2017, to waive the entire loan of about ₹90,000 crore of farmers and farm labourers, but their debt has now increased to ₹1.5 lakh crore. “This includes loans raised from the government, cooperative and private banks as well as from the unorganised sector,” he said at a press conference, recalling how forms were got filled from farmers and labourers. The AAP leader asked CM Channi whether he would waive the entire loan or not. “If you do, then declare its time limit and the entire loan of the farmers and laborers should be waived before the code of conduct is implemented in the state. If the government cannot keep this promise, then all other things are just a hoax,” he said. On ₹17,000 per acre compensation announced by the state government to farmers for crop affected by the pink bollworm pest, he asked the chief minister whether this amount was sufficient to compensate the farmers for the crop damage. “The farmers spent ₹60,000 to 70,000 per acre, but the compensation amount is a mockery,” he added. Cheema cautioned the people, particularly farmers, of Punjab to be wary of the hollow announcements of the Channi government, calling them “election stunts”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/channi-govt-in-punjab-betrayed-farmers-by-not-fulfilling-loan-waiver-promise-aap-101637266264153.html
19-11-2021||Chandigarh||Drug cases: Punjab govt opposes Akali MLA Majithia’s plea to be impleaded as party in high court||The Punjab government on Thursday told the Punjab and Haryana high court that Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) MLA and former minister Bikram Singh Majithia had no right to be heard at this stage in the drug cases.Supreme Court lawyer Dushyant Dave, who appeared for the state government for the first time in the case, told the high court bench of Justices AG Masih and Sandeep Moudgil that Majithia had been “sitting on the fence” for 5-7 years and thus had no right to be heard at this stage. Dave also brought to notice of the court some SC orders, in which timeframe was given to dispose of these matters. The bench did not issue notice on the application moved by Majithia even as senior advocate RS Cheema, who appeared for him, mentioned that he be heard by the court.During the brief hearing on Thursday, Justice Masih, senior judge on the bench, told the lawyers that composition of bench has got changed and both the judges are yet to peruse the sealed cover reports and Justice Moudgil is yet to acquaint himself with the case. Now the matter stands deferred for December 6. On the last date of hearing on October 26, the court had told lawyers it would peruse the reports and decide by November 18 whether the sealed cover reports are to be opened. But in the interim, the composition of bench got changed due to new appointments. The reports lying in a sealed cover since 2018 are on the role of high-profile politicians and police officials in drug cases. These reports have been filed in a 2013 suo motu petition in which the court is monitoring the probe in drug cases of Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh. Majithia in his plea has argued that he be made a party as his image was being tarnished by his political opponents by linking him to drug cases only for reaping political benefits. He has said that his political adversaries were targeting him without there being any substantial material on record when the Vidhan Sabha elections are round the corner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/drug-cases-punjab-govt-opposes-akali-mla-majithia-s-plea-to-be-impleaded-as-party-in-high-court-101637266023702.html

19-11-2021||Chandigarh||42 Patiala councillors ask Capt loyalist mayor Bittu to prove majority in House||As many as 42 councillors of Patiala municipal corporation formally submitted a requisition with ‘beleaguered’ Patiala mayor Sanjeev Sharma Bittu on Thursday, asking him to call a general house meeting in order to prove majority in the House. The requisition has been sent under Section 39 of the Patiala Municipal Corporation Act, 1976, which defines process of removal of mayor, senior deputy mayor and deputy mayor. A protégé of Captain Amarinder Singh, Bittu has been facing stiff rebellion from fellow councillors over his proximity with the former CM. On Thursday, led by local bodies minister Brahm Mohindra, as many as 39 councillors met Harish Chaudhary, the Congress in-charge of Punjab affairs, and demanded immediate removal of Bittu. On the other hand, nearly 18 councillors who support Bittu met member of Parliament Preneet Kaur. Of the 60 seats in the House, 32 are in Captain’s constituency, 26 in local bodies minister Brahm Mohindra’s Patiala (rural) constituency and two in Sanaur. The requisition letter stated: “We have elected you (Bittu) as mayor as per the Act but now almost all the House members have lost confidence in you. Therefore, it would be appropriate for you to either resign from your post on moral ground or call a House meeting and prove the confidence as per law.” The letter further stated that more than two thirds of members will support the no confidence motion. “If the meeting is not called immediately as per the Act, the undersigned will reserve the right to knock door of the Punjab government and of competent court of law,” the letter said. “The councillors narrated their grievances to Chaudhary, who gave a patient hearing and assured them to resolve the matter,” Mohindra said. Meanwhile, Bittu said as per the Act, he is to call meeting within 14 days. “I will consult it with my leaders in order to decide the next course of action,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/42-patiala-councillors-ask-capt-loyalist-mayor-bittu-to-prove-majority-in-house-101637265783768.html

The man was a head constable with the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), who was found dead along with his 50-year-old wife at their residence. Their relatives raised alarm after the couple failed to answer their repeated calls. Initial investigation suggested that they died of poisoning, the police said while not ruling out the possibility of a suicide pact. The report of man’s viscera is also awaited to confirm the cause of death. The woman’s autopsy got delayed as it was discovered that she was suffering from Covid. Her postmortem examination is likely to be conducted on Friday.

19-11-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC polls: Ticket allocation, change in ward dynamics major challenges before Congress||Hoping to return to winning ways to Chandigarh’s electoral politics, the Congress is in a major fix over the allocation of tickets. Internal pressure from some quarters is mounting on the party for allotting two tickets within a family. The party is also facing a challenge of adjusting many of its leaders who lost their traditional seats either to reconfiguration of wards or fresh reservation. Four-time Congress MP from the city and national treasure of the party, Pawan Kumar Bansal admits that the change in ward dynamics has put a major challenge before them. “For some seats, women leaders were working very hard, but now those have been declared as general wards. In other wards, male Congress workers had put in a lot of efforts but those were earmarked for women. Similarly, the areas of many wards have been changed. It is a major difficulty for the Congress. We will have to discuss it within the party,” he said. Not outrightly ruling out the possibility of allocation of two tickets within a family, Bansal said, “It is too early to speak on this issue. When the committee with the party in-charge at the helm will discuss each ward, all these points will be taken up.” The issue of two tickets in a family gained currency after a sitting councillor made public statements seeking two tickets after his ward area was reserved for women. Subsequently, some other party leaders also claimed two tickets. Notably, the Congress had invited applications for tickets. Congress state president Subhash Chawla said that the party has received 190 applications for 35 wards. “After the code of conduct is announced, we will first shortlist three candidates per ward and thereafter decide the final one.”On the criterion for ticket allocation, Bansal said, “Winnability is the main factor but also the fact how much the candidate has worked for making city residents’ lives better. How much he has contributed to make the party stronger. A candidate’s honest character also determines his winnability.”Nearly half of the tickets will go to new faces, said Chawla.Aiming to end losing streakChandigarh, which has been traditionally a strong bastion for the party, saw major change after the 2014 Lok Sabha elections as it lost three successive polls in the city. The Congress has lost two Lok Sabha elections in 2014 and 2019. The party’s loss in 2016 MC elections came at a time when the Modi government had announced the demonetisation. The party could only win four out of total 26 wards. Later, a BJP councillor crossed over to it taking its tally to five councillors in the House.“The wins and losses are party to the democratic process. We have a strong winning record in the city. We are confident that we will win big this time around,” said Bansal.The party is banking heavily on the ‘anti-incumbency’ against the ruling BJP, ‘high’ inflation and is also looking to gain from the anti-farm laws protests. “The BJP has failed miserably to deliver on any of its promises. Its policy, both at the central and municipal levels, has been anti-people. High inflation and unprecedented imposition of huge taxes and new charges in the BJP-ruled MC have made residents’ life very tough,” said Bansal.Meanwhile, Chawla said, “The water charges were increased many folds, putting heavy financial burden on residents. The partial rollback announced was a gimmick and is only till March 2022. After elections, the charges will be automatically increased.”Instead of claiming its financial rights from the Centre and bringing the required funds, the BJP has put all revenue generation burden on city residents, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-mc-polls-ticket-allocation-change-in-ward-dynamics-major-challenges-before-congress-101637265185030.html
19-11-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana court issues arrest warrant against MLA Bains in rape case||Non-bailable warrant (NBW) with direction for arrest by December 1 has been issued against Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) chief and Atam Nagar (Ludhiana) MLA Simarjit Singh Bains and other accused in the alleged rape case of 44-year-old woman. The next date of hearing is on December 1. Police have already submitted a charge sheet in the said case in the court. The court of judicial magistrate had earlier issued bailable warrants against the MLA, but the police in their reply stated that they went to serve the notice to the accused, but he was not present at home. Former MLA and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader advocate Harish Rai Dhanda, the victim’s counsel, said they submitted an application in the court on Thursday and requested the court to time-bound directions to a particular police officer to arrest the accused. Dhanda said the police are hand-in-glove with the accused and they made an excuse in the charge sheet that arresting Bains could cause a law-and-order situation in the city. The victim, a widow, had alleged that she was ‘raped’ by MLA Bains multiple times, and had been protesting for eight months prior to the registration of the FIR. The victim has also alleged that the MLA and his men had promised to help her in a property dispute, but started exploiting her sexually instead. After the police failed to register a case initially, the woman approached the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-court-issues-arrest-warrant-against-mla-bains-in-rape-case-101637265183554.html
19-11-2021||Chandigarh||PGIMER to soon take a call on ending tele-consultation||The Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) may soon take a call on discontinuing the tele-consultation facility in order to scale up physical consultations at its out-patient department (OPD). The daily tele-consultations have already dipped by around 80% in the past two months after the institute reopened the physical OPDs with prior appointments and walk-in registrations. At present, only 500 to 600 patients are getting OPD consultations through phone calls per day while the count was over 3,000 in September. Meanwhile, the number of people attending physical OPDs in PGIMER is increasing every day. But the daily footfall of patients is yet to match the pre-Covid times. On an average, more than 6,500 people are availing physical consultations in the OPD daily. Before the Covid started spreading, over 10,000 patients visited PGIMER’s OPDs daily. In the last 10, days (from November 8 to November 17) as many as 59,042 patients have attended the physical OPDs in PGIMER, while consultation on phone was given to only 5,304 patients. Since the suspension of walk-in consultation and online appointments in March last year, the institute had been providing OPD services only through tele-consultation. The physical consultations had resumed on June 21 this year, but only after prior appointment through tele-consultation, until walk-in OPDs started on September 27.“The institute had revised its tele-consultation registration timings to 10.30am to 11.15am from 8am to 9am. Since patients do not get satisfied with the consultations through phone, they prefer to visit the hospital to meet doctors. Since the starting of the walk-in OPD facility, the tele-consultation registrations are dropping. From over 3,000 per day, the count had come down to 1,500 in October and then further dropped to 600 in November,” said Dr Surjit Singh, director, PGIMER. He added, “In the next few days, we are expecting tele-consultation numbers to drop further. Soon, we will take a call on discontinuing this facility so as to bring back the patient facilities like pre-Covid times. Besides OPDs, we are also focusing on doing maximum elective surgeries to provide best treatment and care to the patients.”‘Online registrations will also be scaled up’The PGIMER director also said that the facility of online registrations for the institute’s OPDs will be scaled up and cap on the daily numbers will be relaxed to streamline the flow of patients. “We will also look for increasing the online registrations so that people can make advance booking to consult the doctors at PGIMER, that too with their own convenient time,” he added. For physical consultation through the institute’s official website, PGIMER is at present allowing 50 patients per department and 100 for three major departments — ophthalmology (eye), hepatology (liver) and internal medicine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pgimer-to-soon-take-a-call-on-ending-teleconsultation-101637264763820.html
19-11-2021||Chandigarh||Take action if evidence links us to drugs, sacrilege cases: Sukhbir dares Channi govt||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Thursday dared the Congress government in Punjab to act against him or any other Akali leader if it has evidence to link them to drugs and sacrilege cases. Sukhbir was talking to the mediapersons after inducting Congress party’s intellectual cell’s former chairman Anish Sidana and his supporters into the party at SAD headquarters in Chandigarh. Sukhbir announced Sidana’s appointment as his political adviser for urban areas. Sidana’s exit comes after another senior Hindu leader Raman Behl left the Congress and joined the Aam Aadmi Party on November 9. The Congress is facing the challenge of retaining its Hindu leaders. Sidana, a member of the Kandi Area Development Board (KADB) till a few months ago, belongs to Jalalabad and had been voicing his concerns regarding the lack of adequate representation in the state Congress. On October 31, he even wrote an open letter to Congress leader Sonia Gandhi, citing indiscipline in the party. Reacting to demands by the Congress party for making public a report by the state government’s special task force (STF) on drugs, which is lying in sealed cover at the Punjab and Haryana high court, Sukhbir said, “What stopped the Congress government from acting against the drug traffickers during their four-and half-year term. None was arrested, and now the government is politicising the issue by targeting us. They could have released the report and I throw a challenge on them to come out with the slightest of evidence against us,” added Sukhbir. The drugs case came up for hearing in the high court on Thursday and was adjourned for December 6. “The chief minister, home minister Sukhjinder Randhawa and DGP IPS Sahota are liable to be charged under Section 120(b) of IPC for a criminal conspiracy to frame me in sacrilege cases,” he told the mediapersons. Speaking on the Congress’s promise of debt waiver to the state farmers, the former deputy chief minister said the farmers, as well as farm unions, could never be satisfied until the government implemented the complete waiver as promised ahead of the 2017 polls. “The Congress party even took an oath on the Gutka Sahib on this issue and Channi was a party to this commitment. Now, he should not try to run away from it,” he added. On Wednesday’s meeting of farmer union leaders with the chief minister, Sukhbir said the representatives were expected to take up the shortage and black-marketeering of DAP fertiliser. On the cancellation of permits of buses owned by the Badals, Sukhbir named transport minister Amrinder Singh Raja Warring behind the unjust move as it was done without issuing a notice. “We do not owe even a single rupee in taxes to the Punjab government. In contrast, companies of Congress leaders are defaulters but are not being proceeded against,” he said. SAD leaders Prem Singh Chandumajra, Daljit Singh Cheema, Raj Kumar Gupta, and Hansraj Josan were also present. ‘Harsimrat not to contest state polls’ Sukhbir said that party’s Lok Sabha MP from Bathinda Harsimrat Kaur Badal will not contest the upcoming state polls. However, he said, no decision has been taken on five-time CM Parkash Singh Badal’s contesting the state polls. “The decision will be discussed at the party level,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/take-action-if-evidence-links-us-to-drugs-sacrilege-cases-sukhbir-dares-channi-govt-101637264583686.html

19-11-2021||Chandigarh||Khattar: Accusing farmers for air pollution not justified||KARNAL: Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar said on Thursday that besides stubble burning, several other factors are also responsible for air pollution in the Delhi and NCR.“Accusing farmers of others for the air pollution is not justified. Even the supreme court has also observed that several other activities, including emission from vehicles and industry and construction activities were also responsible for the air pollution,” Khattar said when asked to respond Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s allegations that stubble burning in neighbouring states was also causing air pollution in Delhi.The allegations that farmers were behind the air pollution in Delhi are baseless as now the Delhi government has also announced several measures to deal with air pollution, Khattar said during his visit to Karnal late evening. “I don’t deny that the stubble burning was adding to the air pollution, besides several other factors, but Haryana government has succeeded to cut incidents of farm fires as several schemes were introduced to encourage farmers for the management of the crop waste,” he added. On whether Haryana government was considering to follow Delhi’s odd-even formula for vehicles , the CM said the decision will be taken on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/khattar-accusing-farmers-for-air-pollution-not-justified-101637263992861.html

The government has destroyed the governance system in the state as there are no teachers in schools, no doctors in hospitals, no patwari in revenue office, no MSP and fertilisers for farmers and no one standing for the rights of the poor and common man. We are not fighting only to change the government, but to change the atmosphere of the state. How will people live when farming and fertilisers are expensive and the prices of diesel, petrol, LPG, steel bars, cement, medicines and ambulances are skyrocketing,” the leader of opposition added.The leader of opposition also announced to hold the biggest rally of the country in Jind after Covid situation improves.“Jind has always changed the dynamics of state politics and we will sound a bugle against this corrupt government from this farmers’ land. I will organise the biggest rally of the country in Jind once we defeat Covid,” Hooda added.Ex-CM’s show of strengthThe former CM again showed his political strength in the Congress as a 23 MLAs out of 31, more than 100 former MLAs, ministers and MPs attended his rally. Eight MLAs and other leaders, who are loyal to other leaders gave the event a miss.Hooda attacked JJP leader and Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala while accusing him of ‘betraying the voters’ by supporting the BJP to form the government in 2019.“The voters had given a clear mandate against the BJP by defeating most of its cabinet ministers. The JJP leaders had claimed of throwing the BJP out of Yamuna in the 2019 assembly polls but they sat in their lap when it fell short of a clear majority. Haryana was known for the highest per capita income, per capita investment, happiness of farmers, respect of our sportsperson, speed of development during our rule. Now, our state has bagged first rank in unemployment, crime, drug addiction, corruption and misery. Our sisters and daughters are forced to stand in queues for hours to get fertiliser and the DAP is being sold amid police security,” Hooda added.Rajya Sabha MP Deepender Hooda said due to lackadaisical approach and anti-people mindset, the CM and his deputy had to resort to lathicharge to enter their constituencies Karnal and Uchana Kalan, respectively.“Despite this, the BJP government is ignoring the pain of farmers agitating for their demands for the last one year. I may be the only opposition MP from the state, but I will not allow the voice of the farmers to be weakened and will work vigorously to raise it in Parliament,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/vipaksh-aapke-samaksh-rally-bjp-jjp-govt-has-corrupted-state-s-atmosphere-says-hooda-101637263683494.html

19-11-2021||Chandigarh||Conduct semester exams online: PU student bodies||Panjab University (PU) student bodies have expressed opposition to the varsity authorities’ decision to hold the semester examinations in offline mode. They are demanding the exams to be conducted in online mode.The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad’s Panjab University unit on Thursday submitted a memorandum to the PU vice-chancellor for conducting the examination in said medium. The activists of the students’ organisation said there should have been offline classes for at least two months before the authorities could decide on conducting the exams physically. ABVP’s PU president Paras Ratan said, “We have been repeatedly contacting the authorities for the last few months regarding offline classes in all departments so that physical exams can be held efficiently. However, without sufficient number of offline classes, it would be against the interest of the students to declare the conduct of offline examination directly. Along with this, there is also the issue of accommodation for the students from outside the UT, hence online exams should be held.”Members of the Students for Society (SFS), in a letter to V-C, said, “Conducting offline exams appears to be irrational and unfair move as this entire semester has been taught in online mode and not a single practical class has been taken till now. The university can’t expect the students to perform the practicals physically in offline mode.” Meanwhile, Student Organisation of India (SOI) members gathered outside the V-C office on Thursday to protest against the decision. “Students’ demands are not being addressed properly by the university. If authorities will not conduct online exams, then we will again go for a protest with proper gathering as this issue is related to the future of thousands of students,” said SOI leader Manjodh Padda. He added that they were addressed by the controller, who had assured them that the issue will be resolved within 10 days. Members of the National Students Union of India (NSUI) also staged a protest against the university’s decision to conduct offline exams. “COE has said that the university has started planning to conduct offline exams, but it has not been confirmed yet. We have given our representation to conduct online exams,” they added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/conduct-semester-exams-online-pu-student-bodies-101637263384872.html

The farmer leader said he has recorded his statement and told the commission that he was not present in Karnal when the lathicharge took place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/skm-feud-out-in-the-open-now-rajewal-slams-charuni-for-his-political-ambitions-101637263203644.html

The court also sought a reply from the state government on crossing the 50% reservation limit imposed by the Supreme Court. As of now, the reservation in Madhya Pradesh is 73%.A contempt petition filed by Prabal Pratap Singh and 11 others said the high court earlier stayed implementation of 27% OBC reservation in the state.“Earlier, rejecting the application to revoke the stay on implementation of 27% OBC reservation, the high court fixed the final date of hearing on December 6. Despite this, the government implemented OBC and EWS reservation to fill posts of higher secondary teachers,” said lawyer Aditya Sanghi who appeared for one of the petitioners.“The General Administration Department issued a circular citing the opinion of the advocate general that 27% reservation can be implemented in other departments other than the cases in which the high court has stayed. On the basis of this circular, the Public Instruction Commissioner has issued the final list of selected teachers,” said Sanghi. The lawyer said there was a clear order of the Supreme Court that the reservation should not exceed 50%. Due to the implementation of OBC and EWS reservations, the total reservation exceeds 73%. Apart from this, there is no constitutional provision for caste-based reservation, Sanghi said.Additional advocate general RK Verma said, “After hearing the petition, the division bench issued notice to the state government and sought reply by December 6.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/mp-high-court-stays-selection-of-school-teachers-over-27-obc-quota-provision-101637263083702.html

Chadha, who is also the AAP’s national spokesperson, said the party delegation has been denied permission to visit Kartarpur Sahib by the Modi-Channi duo. “It is clear that as per a tactical understanding between PM Modi and CM Channi, only Channi and his men are permitted to visit. The match-fixing between Modi and Channi has surfaced yet again,” Chadha tweeted with a copy of the letter sent by a joint secretary of the Union ministry of external affairs (MEA) to the general administration department on Wednesday. NOT EVEN AN ENEMY SHOULD BE STOPPED, TWEETS KEJRIWALAAP national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal also tweeted that it was wrong to prevent anyone from paying obeisance at a gurdwara on Gurpurb. “Such politics is not good for the country and society. Not even an enemy should be stopped,” he posted. The Punjab government had asked for political clearance for the visit of a delegation led by chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Thursday. However, the Centre, while granting political clearance to 44 persons, divided the CM, ministers, Congress MLAs and officers into three separate groups for the visit to be undertaken from November 18-20. A senior officer said that political clearance was received for those who were to be part of the chief minister’s delegation. AAP MLA and leader of opposition (LOP) Harpal Singh Cheema said party MLAs were planning to visit Kartarpur on Friday but were informed by the state government that it had not received clearance for their visit. “We have been asked to apply under regular system. We all (Mann and party MLAs) will go to Dera Baba Nanak on Friday and pay obeisance from there,” the LOP said, pointing out that they had sent their papers to the state government on Wednesday and Thursday morning. Mann had, on Wednesday, announced their plans to visit Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib on the occasion of Guru Nanak Dev’s Parkash Utsav to offer prayers for the progress, prosperity and happiness of Punjab. Punjab cabinet minister Raj Kumar Verka accused the AAP of indulging in cheap talk and politics. “It is everyone’s right to travel to Kartarpur to offer prayers. If the Centre has denied them (AAP MLAs) permission, it is wrong,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/denied-permission-to-visit-kartarpur-say-aap-mlas-101637262963433.html
19-11-2021||Chandigarh||Mother stuck in UK, HC gives minor boy’s custody to father||The Punjab and high court has given custody of a minor boy to his father as the mother is stuck in United Kingdom, due to litigation between the couple.The high court order came on the plea of a Jind man, who had sought the custody of his two-year-old son, living with the parents of his estranged wife. “The petitioner is the natural guardian of his minor child. But for some bald allegations made against him, there is no reason to believe that he would not conduct himself as a good and caring father,” the bench of justice HS Sidhu said, adding that the mother’s return is uncertain in view of her passport and travel documents having been seized because of the pending proceedings initiated by the her husband in the UK.The woman had told the court that she intended to return to India to take her son to the UK.However, the court said it would not be in the interest of the minor to be permitted to travel to UK pending a determination of various disputes between the parties in the courts. Also, the woman would have to single-handedly take care of the son and a daughter, which may be difficult in view of the demands of her career. In India, the minor boy can enjoy the care, love and affection of his grandparents and other members of the family both on the paternal and maternal side and his father.According to case, the couple married in November 2010 and are parents of two children --- a 10-year-old girl and the boy --- who was born in the UK in 2019. Soon after that, the couple came to India and a matrimonial discord started. They both started living separately --- the woman in Sonepat with her parents and the husband in Jind at his parents’ home. Both the children were in mother’s care. The husband had approached the high court for custody in September. Later, it came to light that the woman went back to the UK leaving the son in Sonepat with her parents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mother-stuck-in-uk-hc-gives-minor-boy-s-custody-to-father-101637262903497.html
19-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi pollution: EDMC seizes 7 vehicles carrying construction material||NEW DELHI: Complying with the Delhi government’s order imposing a complete ban on construction activities in the city, the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) on Thursday seized seven vehicles found carrying construction and demolition (C&D) waste.Deputy commissioner (North Shahdara) Sanjeev Mishra said that a comprehensive action plan has been started to mitigate air pollution. “Several teams have been constituted to carry out field inspections to keep day and night vigil against garbage and biomass burning, illegal dumping of C&D waste and polluting industrial activities. Several water sprinklers have been deployed to control dust pollution by spraying dust suppressants,” he said.He further said that punitive action is being taken against entities, both institutional and individuals, indulging in activities generating air pollution under EDMC. Special drives are being launched to monitor and prevent activities adding to air pollution, in the areas of Sonia Vihar, Karawal Nagar and Wazirabad Road. Officials said monetary challans have been issued, under the provisions of the National Green Tribunal Act and Environment Protection Act, against individual owners and builders found violating the ban on construction activities and taking building materials or C&D waste. “Some of the agencies penalised under the NGT Act include the public works department (PWD), Mass Rapid Transit System (MRTS), Delhi Development Authority (DDA), BSES and Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC),” he said. According to senior EDMC officials, a challan of ₹50,000 was issued against the MRTS in Sonia Vihar area and a challan of ₹50,000 was issued against DDA in Gautampuri area. “So far, seven challans, each of ₹50,000, have been issued against the PWD for violating the pollution norms. Altogether 140 challans have been issued, amounting to ₹18.95 lakh, against different defaulters in Shahdara north zone in the month of November so far,” said Mishra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-pollution-edmc-seizes-7-vehicles-carrying-construction-material-101637262243454.html
19-11-2021||Delhi||Truck ban falls flat at several border points in Delhi||A day after the Delhi government issued an order banning the entry of all trucks, except those carrying essential goods, into the Capital till November 21 to control the rising pollution levels in the city, a spot check by HT on Thursday showed that its enforcement remained lax at several border points as trucks went past tolls without any checks.At the Badarpur border, the toll collectors said that they were not aware of any directions to stop the entry of trucks coming into the city from Haryana. A toll collector said that around 20-25 trucks bearing Haryana registration had crossed the borders by Thursday afternoon.“Since morning, trucks are moving freely here. We are not aware of any restrictions and we have not been directed to check the vehicles (if they are carrying essential goods or not) before letting them pass,” said Sanjeev Kumar, who was stationed at the Badarpur toll booth on Thursday afternoon.A few metres away from the toll, the driver of a medium-sized parked truck bearing a Haryana number plate, said, “I am on my way back. I am not aware of any restriction.”At the Pul Prahladpur border, a few kilometres away, police barricades were in place but it was unmanned. A row of small trucks were parked at the Pul Prahladpur village but HT couldn’t confirm if they were carrying essential goods.However, at the Apsara border near east Delhi’s Dilshad Garden, strict checks were being conducted, with enforcement teams comprising Delhi Police officials, traffic personnel and paramilitary staff manning the area around the toll plaza.An official stationed at the border said that smaller trucks were turned back at the toll gate. For bigger trucks, which might cause traffic congestion while turning, the staff collect the vehicle’s documents at the toll and the drivers are asked to collect them after taking a U-turn at the nearest point.“There is a three-tier check here. We are collecting the vehicle documents so that the drivers do not drive past the borders,” said the official, who asked not be named.Meanwhile, the Gurugram police too set up barricades at 10 locations in the district and diverted trucks through the western peripheral expressway towards other states. Gurugram Police said that at least 200 trucks that were on their way to Delhi via Gurugram were diverted from Shankar Chowk on Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway on Thursday, in compliance with the measures announced to prevent further deterioration of air quality in the National Capital Region.Sanjeev Balhara, assistant commissioner of police (traffic), said, “We have set up checkpoints and deployed teams at all locations where heavy vehicles enter the expressway. At least 300 personnel are deployed at the borders and are checking all vehicles to ensure only vehicles carrying essential commodities enter the city,” he said.Gurugram police have also asked neighbouring districts – Nuh, Rewari and Jhajjar – to not allow heavy vehicles and re-route them via KMP Expressway.The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) order on Wednesday assigned the task of banning trucks to the Delhi Police, Delhi’s transport department, the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) and the three municipal corporations (North, South and East). The order followed similar directions issued by the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) for Delhi-NCR and adjoining areas to control the rising pollution levels in the city.Officials had said that the order is unlikely to cause chaos as most of the non-destined commercial vehicles now bypass the city by taking the eastern and western peripheral expressways that form a ring around the Capital.“We have issued strict directions that no laxity will be tolerated. Trucks are being checked at the borders and if they are carrying non-essentials, they are being turned back,” said a senior DPCC official.The Delhi traffic police officials said that they have held talks with all the major truck associations, asking them to comply with the order.“All the associations/unions of truck operators/owners and drivers have been advised to make adequate arrangements at their own level for proper parking and halting of their trucks outside Delhi borders, at suitable places like warehouses, transport hubs etc till November 21,” said Manish Kumar Agarwal, special commissioner of police (traffic).He added, “Police authorities of neighbouring NCR towns have also been requested to make adequate arrangements for diversion of such trucks, which are not supposed to enter Delhi, in order to avoid congestion at border points.”Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy at the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said the contribution from trucks in Delhi’s air has reduced over the last couple years due to the expressways, but they are still one of the biggest polluters in the vehicle segment.“These are heavy duty vehicles, and trucks enter Delhi in the night when temperatures are low and these emissions can stay trapped in the air till the next day. In our analysis in 2015, we found that trucks were contributing to around 30% of the total pollution due to vehicles,” she said.Tanushree Ganguly, Programme Lead at the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), said while the ban on entry of trucks into Delhi was a good move, there also needs to be a restriction on the movement of private vehicles in order to complement the ban.“Cutting down intra-city vehicular traffic would not only reduce vehicular exhaust emissions but also contribute to reducing re-suspended dust and idling emissions,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/truck-ban-falls-flat-at-several-border-points-in-delhi-101637262123437.html
19-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi pollution: Air quality improves in index, stays very poor||New Delhi Delhi’s air quality improved on Thursday, dropping to the lower half of the “very poor” category with an Air Quality Index (AQI) reading of 347 on the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB’s) daily bulletin, as a change in wind direction to south-easterly reduced the contribution of stubble burning to just 2%, weather officials said.In comparison, the AQI was 375 (also very poor) on Wednesday. While south-easterly winds will reduce the impact from stubble burning in the next 48 hours as well, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said this will also lead to a rise in mercury, with the minimum temperature increasing to around 12 degrees Celsius by Friday. North-westerly winds are meanwhile expected to return from November 21, with strong local winds expected to lead to dispersal of pollutants. Agencies said Delhi was currently witnessing calm wind conditions, offsetting the reduction in emissions from stubble burning. According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), a forecasting body under the central government, only 773 fires were recorded in the northern plains in the last 24 hours. SAFAR’s analysis shows the contribution of stubble burning has been reducing rapidly over the past week, dropping from 10% on November 15 to 8% the next day, 6% on November 17 and 2% on Thursday. “Delhi’s AQI will improve but it will remain in the ‘very poor’ category for the next two days as transport-level winds are now coming from the eastern direction, preventing intrusion of any pollutants from the stubble burning region. However, local surface winds are low and mixing layer height is above 1km, resulting in moderate ventilation of near-surface pollutants. From November 21 onwards, surface winds are likely to be strong resulting in effective dispersion that improves air quality,” said SAFAR, stating that with just 773 fires the impact from stubble burning on Thursday was negligible. Delhi recorded a maximum temperature of 26.8 degrees Celsius on Thursday, one degree below normal. The minimum was recorded at 10.5 degrees – two notches below normal. On Wednesday, the minimum temperature dropped to 9.6 degrees at Safdarjung – the lowest so far this season, with the Ayanagar station also recording isolated “cold wave” conditions.Mahesh Palawat, vice president at the private forecasting agency Skymet, said southeasterly winds will continue till November 20, with north-westerly winds to only return from November 21 onwards. “Temperatures will start rising now, with a drop only expected after November 22. The impact of stubble burning will reduce due to south-easterly winds, but at the same time, Delhi is seeing calm conditions,” he said. According to the Early Warning System (EWS) for Delhi, another forecasting mechanism in place in the ministry of earth sciences, strong surface winds over Delhi from November 21 may even bring air quality to the “poor” category.An AQI between 201 and 300 is “poor”, between 301 and 400 “very poor” and over 400 “severe” on the CPCB’s index.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-pollution-air-quality-improves-in-index-stays-very-poor-101637261703686.html

19-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s Sadar Bazar police station adjudged the best in the country||The Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on Wednesday adjudged Sadar Bazar police station in the Capital as the best police station across the country this year, according to police officers aware of the development.Two other police stations -- Gangapur in Odisha and Bhattu Kalan in Haryana -- were ranked second and third on the list.The ranking of police stations across the country is an annual exercise by the MHA, with the stations judged on the basis of parameters like crime rate, investigation and disposal of cases, infrastructure, and delivery of public service, among other features. About 20% of the total points are also based on feedback about the police station from citizens, police officers aware of the marking system said.Built in 1861, the Sadar Bazar police station in north Delhi is one of the oldest police stations in Delhi. According to the police records, the first FIR at the station, for the theft of oil worth ₹7, was registered on December 31, 1861, when Delhi had only five stations – Sabzi Mandi, Mehrauli, Kotwali, Mundka and Sadar Bazar. There are around 200 police stations today.The station house officer of Sadar Bazar, Kirori Lal Yadav, said while policing is a stressful job, they have put in measures to ensure that is not the case for police personnel of this station.Apart from focusing on preventing crime, filing charge sheets before courts quickly, ensuring no pendency of cases and meeting each complainant who visits the station, the station also has an in-house badminton court and a games room for police personnel to relax after a tiring day at work. The crime data for the police station this year was not immediately available.“An inspection of the police station was conducted in October. We were told that the locals of the area were completely satisfied with the kind of policing we have been doing. Since our jobs are really stressful -- both physically and emotionally -- we ensure that the time we spend at the police station should not be something we don’t look forward to. We will work harder now to ensure we live up to the expectations this award brings,” said Yadav.On November 9, the MHA, in a letter to Delhi police commissioner Rakesh Asthana, informed that Sadar Bazar has been chosen as one of the top three police stations across the country. In the letter, the MHA informed that the SHO of the three stations would have to be present at the Lucknow police headquarters on November 19 to receive the award from Home Minister Amit Shah.On Wednesday night, MHA told Delhi Police that Sadar Bazar had won the top place among all police stations.Meanwhile, residents and traders of Sadar Bazar said they were thrilled to hear about the news on social media. Sadar Bazar in north Delhi is one of the largest whole sale markets in north Delhi.Ajay Khanna, a trader in the market, said, “During Covid, when there were tens of thousands of people in the market, police were on the spot to ensure social distancing. The local police personnel made regular visits to our shops to ensure that everyone there was wearing a mask. What else can a trader like me expect? All we want to do is to be able to do our job without interference.”The north district’s deputy commissioner of police, Sagar Singh Kalsi credited the success to all police personnel, who have served in the district and the station.“They deserve the credit for making our police station worth even contesting in the competition, let alone winning it. It is an effort of the officers who held office before me. And not just the police personnel, the public here is very motivated and contributes a lot to policing in the area. Be it a fire situation or managing the traffic, it is the people of this area who take things in hand to help the police manage the situation better,” Kalsi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-sadar-bazar-police-station-adjudged-the-best-in-the-country-101637261343907.html
19-11-2021||Gurugram||Symbolic namaz at one Gurugram gurdwara as Sikhs mark Gurupurab||The Muslims on Thursday said that they will offer “symbolic” namaz at one gurdwara in Gurugram in which only 10 people will participate, a day after the Sikh community offered gurdwaras to them for Friday prayers in view of repeated disruptions by Hindu right-wing groups.The Sikhs will celebrate Gurupurab, the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak on Friday.“We have decided that only 10 people will pray at the Gurdwara Shri Guru Singh Sabha at Kamla Nehru Park in Sadar area, since it is an auspicious occasion for the Sikh community. We do not want them to face any kind of inconvenience,” said Altaf Ahmad, a member of Gurgaon Nagrik Ekta Manch, a citizens’ platform, and spokesperson for Gurgaon Muslim Council.Ahmad said that they wanted to visit the gurdwaras only to offer their wishes on the auspicious occasion, but decided to offer a symbolic namaz after discussing the matter with the members of the gurdwara management.Also read | Sikhs in Gurugram offer Muslims space in gurdwaras for Friday prayersDaya Singh, president of All India Peace Mission and member of the Gurdwara Shri Guru Singh Sabha, said, “There is a Khalsa school adjacent to the gurdwara, we might offer that space too but the committee members will take a call on Friday around 9.30am after a discussion.”“We want to help our Muslim brothers as they do not have space to offer namaz, and are facing problems. We want to spread love and harmony and this move will bring us together,” he added.Sherdil Singh Sandhu, president, Gurdwara Guru Singh Sabha that manages five gurdwaras in the city, was not available for comment despite repeated calls and messages.Over the past two months, right-wing outfits have tried to disrupt namaz being offered in open spaces, specially in Sector 12. On October 29, 35 protesters were detained for attempting to disrupt Friday prayers. Representatives of the Muslim community had agreed to relocate from the Sector 12 site, urging the administration to allot them alternative space, and also clear encroachments from Waqf board properties.Ahmad said the Gurgaon Muslim Council will hold a felicitation programme in Sector 12 for the members of the Sikh community and gurdwara management for their generous offer.Last week, Akshay Yadav, a resident of Sector 12, offered his shop’s premises for Friday prayers.Members of the Muslim community said namaz will be offered at 20 sites designated by the district administration, and sought police protection.Aman Yadav, assistant commissioner of police (Sadar), said they have decided to deploy at least 500 policemen at different locations, and will take strict action against anyone who tries to disrupt namaz. “We are coordinating with the Muslim community and our men will be deployed in plainclothes too. We urge residents to maintain law and order and not to disrupt any religious activities anywhere across the city,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/symbolic-namaz-at-one-gurugram-gurdwara-as-sikhs-mark-gurupurab-101637261163469.html
19-11-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram’s new committee to focus on long-term strategy to reduce pollution||The district-level committee on pollution announced by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Wednesday has been tasked with devising long-term strategies and adopting short-term measures to mitigate pollution in Gurugram. The committee will seek suggestions from residents and experts who want to contribute to this issue, said Yash Garg, deputy commissioner of Gurugram, who will head the panel.Officials said the committee will be formed within a week. Reducing vehicle pollution, dust mitigation, increasing the number of water bodies and afforestation will be the prime focus of the committee, he said on Thursday.Khattar announced the formation of this committee after the issue of rising pollution in the National Capital Region (NCR) came up for discussion during a grievance redressal meeting in Gurugram on Wednesday. The chief minister said the committee will comprise senior engineers from all civic agencies and different departments.“The resources and technical knowledge of different agencies will be combined. Efforts will be made to find long-term and permanent solutions for this problem. We are planning to increase green cover, take permanent measures to reduce dust on roads, and also focus on reducing vehicular pollution and creating more ponds,” said Garg.Reclaiming of water bodies and ponds will also be key objectives of the committee, apart from creating more such water bodies to improve moisture in the air and help reduce pollution, he said.The deputy commissioner also said that engineers and technical personnel from different agencies, who are decision-makers, will be key members of the committee. “We will also be seeking suggestions and ideas from city residents and experts to resolve this issue. The prime objective is to bring down local pollution to a minimum,” he said.With a dip in temperature and an increase in farm fires, Gurugram’s air quality shot up into the “severe” category after Diwali (which was celebrated on November 4) and has since then improved to “very poor”, leading to the suspension of offline classes in schools and colleges and the temporary closure of industrial units not using CNG or PNG as fuel. Gurugram’s Air Quality Index (AQI) reading was recorded at 323 on Thursday, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) bulletin, and the situation is likely to remain the same until there is an improvement in wind speed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugrams-new-committee-to-focus-on-long-term-strategy-to-reduce-pollution-101637261044834.html
19-11-2021||Delhi||Don’t ply diesel buses older than 5 years on Delhi route: Govt to states||The Delhi government has written to Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan governments to direct their state transport corporations to not send diesel-run buses that are older than five years to the national Capital.It also urged the state governments to divert trucks through other routes before they reach Delhi borders to curb congestion which will also help check air pollution.The letter comes after the Supreme Court last week ordered the state government to take emergent steps in view of the hazardous levels of air pollution, and a directive by the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) issued a slew of measures to curb pollution.The government’s letter to the neighbouring states, a copy of which is with HT, said that public transport in the national Capital runs “100% on CNG”, but buses from other states largely continue to run on diesel. “NGT has already directed that diesel vehicles of more than 10 years of life will not be allowed to ply in NCR… I seek your support to strengthen our hands in dealing with the grave situation by minimising the deployment of diesel buses destined for Delhi. It would be appreciated if vehicles of more than five years vintage are not deployed on Delhi bound routes till such time the pollution abates,” said the letter by Delhi transport commissioner Ashish Kundra.It said that enforcement teams in Delhi have been given a clear mandate to impound and scrap any such diesel vehicles found plying in the Capital. “All stage carriage buses are also required to carry a valid pollution under control (PUC) certificate as per provisions of Central Motor Vehicle Act. Enforcement authorities are issuing challans for any vehicles found without a valid PUC in Delhi, which will also be applicable to buses,” the letter said.On re-routing trucks in advance, Kundra wrote: “May I request you to advise local district authorities to divert such trucks beyond the NCR limit itself to avoid congestion at the borders in Delhi and disruption in normal traffic.”The Commission for Air Quality Monitoring (CAQM) on November 16 issued directions mandating the NCR and Delhi authorities to ensure that trucks carrying non-essential items should not be allowed to enter Delhi till November 21, or such further date as deemed necessary.The Supreme Court in the matter of MC Mehta Vs UOI & Ors had earlier directed that the government of UP, Haryana and Rajasthan should provide large size billboards at the exit points towards the alternative highways to inform commercial traffic of diversions. The Supreme Court had also directed that the said governments will take steps to ensure that commercial traffic having destinations other than Delhi should use alternative routes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dont-ply-diesel-buses-older-than-5-years-on-delhi-route-govt-to-states-101637261043338.html
19-11-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad girl students win national competition with their ‘unique’ innovation||Two students from Ghaziabad bagged the first and fourth place for their innovation and creativity in a national competition organized by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) –Indian Institute of Toxicology Research, Lucknow. The competition called Empowering Pupil innovation and Creativity, (EPIC) 2021 was conducted by CSIR –Indian Institute of Toxicology Research, Lucknow, as a part of CSIR Jigyasa, an initiative taken by the CSIR to inspire and motivate the youth to develop innovative scientific thought process and temperament. As part of the selection criteria, 25 entries were shortlisted from more than 3,000 total entries received from all over the country. For the next round, students had to present their innovation in the form of a power point presentation in front of a panel of judges consisting of scientists & educationists, for which the CSIR conducted mentoring sessions in order to refine and improve the students’ innovation.Class 10 student Dhruvi Gupta created an ‘innovative easy toothbrush’, which won her the first prize in the competition. “This toothbrush is designed with the aim to enable people to maintain their oral hygiene even when they are travelling. It is a long thin stretch of sterile paper which can be wrapped around the finger and used to brush teeth. It is similar to a paper soap and needs just a drop of water to become a toothpaste,” said Dhruvi.The 15-year-old added, “This project will not only help travellers but will also benefit police officers, soldiers, astronauts and the underprivileged as it costs only ₹1 for two strips of paper. This price will further decrease when the product is manufactured in bulk”.Dhruvi has been working on the project since she was in Class 7, said Sunila Athley, principal of Amity International School, Vasundhara in Ghaziabad.“Dhruvi had done her research before starting the project; the product was developed a year later when she was in Class 8. The product had to be tested multiple times and it was a year later that the final product was ready,” said Athley.Dhruvi says she wants to be a space scientist when she grows up and has interest in space aeronautics. She was given ₹10,000 as prize money for winning the competition.Meanwhile, Class 9 student Adite Sharma, who is also from the same school, was declared the third runner-up for her innovation titled “Suraksha Kit” and was awarded a cash prize of ₹5,000. The Suraksha Box is a Ultraviolet C (UVC)-light based sanitization box that disinfects a wide variety of things such as keys, masks, wallets and so on.“As the pandemic hit the world in March 2020, the need for sanitization became of utmost importance. I started working on a UV light-led sterilization box for household use. My father, who is also an engineer, helped me with the same and two weeks later, the box was ready to use,” said the 14-year-old.In order to use the box, the product to be sanitized can be placed inside the box and the process starts after switching it on. “The UV light rays kill 99% of the germs and infection on the product. The box also has an emergency cut off switch, which immediately stops the radiation in case someone opens the box while it is under process,” said Adite, a resident of Indirapuram.School principal Athley said the school encourages creative and innovative thinking among the students right from Class 5.“The school runs a programme called Vasudha for students above Class 5 wherein, during the summer holidays, they are encouraged to think about an idea, which can be a project or a prototype. When the school reopens, the students hold presentations for their idea and teachers give them inputs on the same. These initiatives have helped our students achieve accolades and we are very proud of them,” said Athley.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-girl-students-win-national-competition-with-their-unique-innovation-101637260983369.html
19-11-2021||Delhi||In a first, Delhi govt allows diesel vehicles to be retrofitted into EVs||The Delhi government on Thursday took two significant steps to boost electric vehicles (EVs) numbers in the city — one. it has allowed the conversion of old diesel vehicles into EVs so that they can be run in Delhi-NCR even after 10 years; and two, electric-light commercial vehicles (e-LCVs) will now be exempted from time specific route restrictions and prohibition on idle parking, which are currently applicable to all goods vehicles to reduce pollution and decongest the city.The Delhi traffic police has also issued a circular in this regard in line with the decision of the Delhi government. Several rounds of deliberations were held with the Delhi traffic police to effectively implement the policy and finally, it has now been notified,” transport minister Kailash Gahlot said at a press briefing on Thursday.“The L5N category three-wheeler goods carrier and N1 category goods carrier having gross vehicle weight not exceeding 3.5 tonnes will now be allowed to ply on Delhi’s roads at any time. Since the launch of the Delhi EV policy in August last year, the sale of e-LCVs has gone up from just 46 to 1,054, which is a 95.6% hike in terms of registration. We are hopeful that today’s decisions would give a huge push to mass adoption of EVs across categories in Delhi,” the minister further said.Due to congestion during peak hours and increasing vehicular pollution, the movement of commercial vehicles is restricted on over 250 major roads in Delhi during “no entry” hours. Light commercial vehicles are prohibited on these roads from 7am to 11am and from 5pm to 9pm.Gahlot also announced that the Delhi government is going to allow retrofitting of diesel vehicles in the city which will enable their use beyond the prescribed time span of 10 years, a first such move in the country.“Delhi is now open to the electric retrofitting of internal combustion engines (ICEs). Diesel vehicles, if found fit, can now be converted to EVs by retrofitting. The transport department will soon empanel manufacturers of pure electric kits by approved testing agencies, so that diesel vehicles may continue plying here beyond 10 years,” Gahlot said.Registered diesel vehicles more than 10 years old, and any vehicle over 15 years old, including petrol variants, cannot operate in Delhi-NCR, as per the orders issued by the National Green Tribunal (2015) and the Supreme Court (2018).At least 100,000 such vehicles have been deregistered so far by the Delhi transport department. The number is pretty low as there are 3.8 million overaged vehicles in Delhi that technically cannot ply on city roads. Of these 3.8 million, 3.5 million are petrol variants that are 15 years or more older and approximately 300,000 are diesel vehicles that are 10 years or more older.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/in-a-first-delhi-govt-allows-diesel-vehicles-to-be-retrofitted-into-evs-101637260865990.html
19-11-2021||Gurugram||41 occupancy papers revoked as Gurugram homeowners face heat over plan violations||The Department of Town and Country Planning (DTCP) on Thursday said that it had withdrawn and cancelled the occupation certificates (OCs) issued to 41 house owners for violating their building plans after obtaining the OCs. DTCP officials said that the violations were being viewed seriously and they were also planning to get FIRs registered against the violators. A property owner is required to obtain an OC to access essential services and occupy the property. The buildings which were inspected and had their licenses cancelled were located in Palam Vihar, Uppal South End, Vipul World, Sun City, DLF phase one and Vatika India Next in Sector 83. RS Bhath, district town planner, enforcement, said that last week, the enforcement department formed teams to inspect buildings whose owners had received OCs. They observed large-scale violations during the inspections. “We decided to cancel the OCs of 41 such buildings. We issued notices to the architects concerned and will take action against contractors. We notified the tehsildars of these areas and asked them not to register the deeds of these properties,” he said. DTCP officials said that violations in these plots majorly included covering setbacks, constructions in stilt areas, building extra rooms and additional constructions. The department is now planning to lodge complaints with the police against plot owners, architects and contractors, said officials. “We have received strict instructions from our headquarter that building plan violations in plots must not be tolerated and strict action must be taken against individual owners. We will also demolish such additional constructions and seal the premises,” said Ashish Sharma, assistant town planner, enforcement. Recently, the enforcement wing also demolished such illegal construction in a house in DLF Phase 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/41-occupancy-papers-revoked-as-gurugram-homeowners-face-heat-over-plan-violations-101637260864562.html
19-11-2021||Noida||At 13,113 doses, Gautam Budh Nagar falls short of mega vaccination drive target||Gautam Budh Nagar inoculated 13,113 people against its target of 24,000 beneficiaries during the mega Covid-19 vaccination drive held on Thursday, said officials. More than 5,000 beneficiaries got their first dose, and 8,006 received their second dose on Thursday.The vaccination drive was carried out at government Covid vaccination centres (CVCs) -- with 44 in Bisrakh block, 12 in Dankaur block, 14 in Jewar block, and 13 in Dadri block.According to the CoWIN portal, so far, the district has administered 2,918,466 doses -- 1,842,652 first doses and 1,075,814 second doses. Officials, meanwhile, said that the district has achieved 120% coverage of the first dose of Covid vaccines.“According to the official estimates, Gautam Budh Nagar has a population of 15.89 lakh, and we have already administered the first dose to 18.42 lakh people, which is 120% of our target. In addition, there is still a floating population in the district which has been turning up to get the first dose,” said Dr Neeraj Tyagi, district immunisation officer.He, however, did not comment on the district falling short of meeting its target on Thursday.“The health department conducted a door-to-door surveillance in the district from September 7 to 16, in which 56,489 people above the age of 45 years were yet to take the jab. Since then, over 40,000 of the beneficiaries have been vaccinated, but still, nearly 10,000 to 15,000 people -- above the age of 60 years -- are yet to get the first dose. The health department’s Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) workers have also been tasked to administer vaccines to these people,” Dr Tyagi added.Official data shows that 2,075,645 people in the 18-44 age group, 558,231 people in the 45-60 age group, and 284,590 people above the age of 60 years have been vaccinated so far.“Nearly 70% of the total beneficiaries come to get their second dose, and the remaining for the first dose. Though the number of beneficiaries for the second dose has increased in the past two months, beneficiaries wanting to get their first dose have remained almost consistent -- just with a slight decline,” said Dr Yatendra Singh, medical superintendent, Bhangel CHC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/at-13-113-doses-gautam-budh-nagar-falls-short-of-mega-vaccination-drive-target-101637260863371.html
19-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi pollution: Of over 700 complaints, only 200 addressed so far||Out of 733 pollution-related complaints registered with the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) over a 28-day period, only 229 have been redressed by various government agencies, according to a review by the pollution control body that highlights the lack of robustness in Delhi’s response to its annual bad air crisis.The North Delhi Municipal Corporation topped the list of agencies that recorded the most unresolved complaints -- 105 out of 126 for an 83% pendency. It was followed by the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (112 unresolved out of 140) with 80% pendency, while the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) and the Delhi Development Authority had resolved only one out of four and nine of 35 complaints they respectively received.The two corporations are ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party, and NDMC and DDA are agencies under the aegis of Union government.The Delhi Jal Board (DJB) was lagging too, having resolved only one of the six complaints it received. And so were the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), which redressed one of the five complaints forwarded to it, and the Delhi State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (DSIDC), which addressed 21 of 36 complaints. DJB, DPCC and DSIIDC come under the Delhi government.The data from the CPCB review for complaints registered between October 20 and November 17 was accessed by HT. Across the city, 504 (or 68%) complaints were still pending across multiple agencies.Delhi Traffic Police, with 13 out of 18 complaints resolved, was among the better performers on this parameter, and the state Public Works Department led the pack with 22 out of 29 complaints resolved.CPCB allows the Delhi residents to file pollution-related complaints -- such as garbage dumping, open fires, dumping of construction waste, and road dust -- either on their official website or through their online redressal portal Sameer, which was launched in 2018.Complainants can upload pictures of violations in their localities, giving a description of the area. After assessing the credibility of the complaint, the pollution monitoring body assigns it to various agencies that are responsible for addressing that particular issue.“The pollution complaints that are logged with CPCB are first reviewed and then forwarded to the agencies concerned for action. Every day we conduct a review to assess the action taken. If complaints are pending for a long duration then we follow it up with the agencies concerned,” said a senior CPCB.Since a day after Diwali, when Delhi’s air entered the severe zone for the first time this season, the air quality has remained in the dangerous range for several days. It was only after at least a week of the city breathing toxic air that the CAQM on the intervention of the Supreme Court issued a set of directions to the governments of Delhi-NCR, which included the shutting down of schools, banning of trucks inside Delhi and ban on construction activities.When contacted, Jogi Ram Jain, the chairperson of the north corporation standing committee, said the civic body has deployed its maximum staff strength for pollution control this season.“I cannot say for sure about why the pendency of complaints is so high, but we have made dedicated teams that are on-ground even at night. They keep a watch on cases of open fires. During the day, our teams ensure that water sprinkling is done on all our roads and mechanical sweeping is also being regularly carried out,” Jain said.A senior PWD official said they were following the directions issued by the state government to control pollution at their construction sites. He said they were prioritising pollution-related complaints, and have given deadlines to their teams to ensure that they were resolved on time.“Pollution control is our priority. Even within the department we have fixed accountability so that complaints are resolved as soon as possible,” the official said.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said, “Fixing responsible is a must when we are dealing with multiple agencies. The whole point of having a public redressal system is to ensure that action is taken against complaints and considering that most of your pollution related action is time sensitive, it is imperative that reviews are done.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-pollution-of-over-700-complaints-only-200-addressed-so-far-101637260685521.html
19-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi riots: Only intended to scare, not kill, says man who pointed gun at cop||Shahrukh Pathan, who is in judicial custody for pointing a pistol at a policeman during the north-east Delhi riots in February last year, moved a bail plea before the city court on Thursday, stating that he only intended to scare the policeman and not kill him.Photographs of Pathan pointing a gun at head constable Deepak Dahiya were widely on social media and he was arrested on March 3, 2020. Pathan is currently lodged in Tihar Jail. He is facing charges of rioting with a deadly weapon, attempt to murder, assault, and obstructing public servants in the discharge of duty under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Arms Act.Seeking bail for Pathan, senior advocate Maneka Guruswamy told the court that no offence of attempt to murder was made out against her client. Guruswamy said Pathan did not shoot Dahiya, instead he only asked the policeman to step back.To prove her point, the counsel played a 26-second video of the alleged incident in the court and said Pathan fired two shots — one in the air and second to his right — following which he had a heated conversation with Dahiya and turned back.Additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat asked the lawyer to replay the video and pointed towards the position of Pathan’s gun just before he fired in the air.“Look at the position of his gun. It is not pointed up. It is straight (at Dahiya). When he is taking aim, it is straight,” the judge noted.The advocate, however, clarified that neither of the two gunshots was aimed at the head constable.“The state’s case is based on Dahiya. He is the potential victim and he was not fired at. The first (shot) is in the air and the second is to the right,” she said.“If I (counsel speaking for the accused) wanted to shoot him, I would have but that was not the intention. I turned around and ran away. Does any of this demonstrate the intention to kill or shoot him? At best, this is the intention to scare….We had a conversation as heated as it can be and then we retreated. Where is the intention to kill? Guruswamy said.Special public prosecutor Anuj Handa, appearing for the police, said Pathan had clearly pointed the gun at the policeman.Opposing Guruswamy’s arguments that Pathan had no intention to kill Dahiya, Handa said, “The gun is pointed slightly downwards directly at the head of the complainant. His (Pathan’s) hand going upwards is because of the recoil after shots are fired.”“The question I ask myself is this, during the first part of the video, he shoots in different directions of the mob, who might be belonging to a different community. Suppose any person succumbed to injuries, would the offence not have been made out? the prosecutor said.Communal clashes broke out in north-east Delhi in February 2020, after a standoff between the Citizenship (Amendment) Act supporters and opposers got out of control, leaving at least 53 people dead and over 700 injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-riots-only-intended-to-scare-not-kill-says-man-who-pointed-gun-at-cop-101637260683211.html
19-11-2021||Gurugram||Barricades set up on Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway; 200 trucks diverted away from Capital||A day after the Delhi government issued an order banning the entry of heavy vehicles into the Capital till November 21, Gurugram police on Thursday set up barricades at 10 locations in the district and diverted trucks through KMP Expressway towards other states. Police said that at least 200 trucks that were on their way to Delhi via Gurugram were diverted from Shankar Chowk on Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway on Thursday, in compliance with the measures announced to prevent further deterioration of air quality in the National Capital Region. Sanjeev Balhara, assistant commissioner of police (traffic), said, “Drivers of around 500 trucks were asked to bypass the routes at Bilaspur and Manesar via KMP Expressway. We have set up checkpoints and deployed teams at all locations where heavy vehicles enter the expressway. At least 300 personnel are deployed at the borders and are checking all vehicles to ensure only vehicles carrying essential commodities enter the city,” he said. Police said heavy vehicles that had already entered Gurugram were sent back from Shankar Chowk after taking a U-turn. Police set up checkpoints at Shankar Chowk, two kilometres before the Sirhaul toll plaza, Bilaspur, Bijwasan, Bajghera and Manesar. These points connect to industrial areas and witness heavy movement of trucks, said police. Gurugram police have also asked neighbouring districts – Nuh, Rewari and Jhajjar – to not allow heavy vehicles and re-route them via KMP Expressway. Traffic police said their staff is deployed in two shifts at KMP Expressway and 11 borders connecting Delhi to check the movement of heavy vehicles. However, a spot check by HT on Thursday showed that its enforcement remained lax at several border points as trucks went past tolls without any checks. At the Badarpur border, the toll collectors said that they were not aware of any directions to stop the entry of trucks coming into the city from Haryana. A toll collector said that around 20-25 trucks bearing Haryana registration had crossed the borders by Thursday afternoon. “Since morning, trucks are moving freely here. We are not aware of any restrictions and we have not been directed to check the vehicles before letting them pass,” said Sanjeev Kumar, who was stationed at the Badarpur toll booth on Thursday afternoon. This HT reporter saw at least five trucks bearing Haryana registration cross over to the Delhi side from Haryana. A few metres away from the toll, the driver of a medium-sized parked truck bearing a Haryana number plate, said, “I am on my way back. I am not aware of any restriction.”Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy at the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said the contribution from trucks in Delhi’s air has reduced over the last couple years due to the expressways, but they are still one of the biggest polluters in the vehicle segment. “These are heavy duty vehicles, and trucks enter Delhi in the night when temperatures are low and these emissions can stay trapped in the air till the next day. In our analysis in 2015, we found that trucks were contributing to around 30% of the total pollution due to vehicles,” she said. Tanushree Ganguly, Programme Lead at the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), said while the ban on entry of trucks into Delhi was a good move, there also needs to be a restriction on the movement of private vehicles in order to complement the ban. “Cutting down intra-city vehicular traffic would not only reduce vehicular exhaust emissions but also contribute to reducing re-suspended dust and idling emissions,” she said. Construction sites asked to take measures Traffic police also said that no vehicle from outside or within Gurugram will be permitted to transport any construction material until November 21. They have formed at least 30 teams to keep a check on construction sites and directed contractors to sprinkle water on construction material at their sites. ACP (traffic) Balhara said that according to National Green Tribunal (NGT) guidelines, regular sprinkling of water is essential and tarpaulin sheets must be placed above dust mounds at construction sites. “We called all contractors at construction sites and directed them to not violate NGT orders. If anyone is found violating rules and regulations, they will be penalised and their work will be stopped with immediate effect,” he said.

19-11-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram’s air quality continues to remain in ‘very poor’ category||Gurugram’s air quality continued to remain in the “very poor” category on Thursday, due to the dip in temperature and low wind speed, which, according to experts, are not allowing pollutants over Gurugram and adjoining areas in the National Capital Region (NCR) to disperse.Gurugram’s Air Quality Index (AQI) reading was recorded at 323 on Thursday, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) bulletin, and the situation is likely to remain the same until there is an improvement in wind speed.This, however, was a slight improvement compared to Wednesday’s AQI reading of 344.All four stations in Gurugram recorded ‘very poor’ air quality on Thursday. Vikas Sadan recorded the highest AQI reading-- 355, followed by Sector 51--324, Teri Gram recorded an AQI reading of 313 and Gwal Pahari recorded an AQI reading of 301.According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), winds from northern hilly states are moving towards the plains, which will bring down the temperature further. Dr Anurani Sharma, associate professor, Teri School of Advanced Studies, said that though there was some dissipation of pollutants two days ago, the situation has again worsened and is unlikely to change in the next few days. “The accumulation of pollutants is taking place again and unless there is a major change in wind speed, or there is some rain, the pollution will remain in the ‘very poor’ or ‘severe’ category, as the temperature is also dipping,” she said.Haryana State Pollution Control Board, meanwhile, said that district authorities and civic agencies were taking all measures according to the Graded Response Action Plan. S Narayanan, member secretary, state pollution control board, said that directions from Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas were being implemented to reduce pollution.The CAQM late night Tuesday directed that schools, colleges, and educational institutions in the National Capital Region will remain closed until further orders. It also said that only five of the 11 thermal power plants located within a 300km radius of Delhi will remain operational till November 30, construction and demolition activities are banned in Delhi-NCR till November 21, and trucks carrying non-essential items have been banned from entering Delhi till Sunday.The district administration said that all civic agencies have been asked to enforce anti-pollution measures and also to take proactive action to help improve air quality.“The construction ban is being implemented strictly. Dust control measures have also been taken and industrial units using CNG and PNG are only allowed to operate,” said Yash Garg, deputy commissioner, Gurugram.On Thursday, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar announced the formation of a committee at the district-level to suggest and implement measures for improving air quality. He also said the government was mulling the implementation of an odd-even scheme for vehicles if there was general consensus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugrams-air-quality-continues-to-remain-in-very-poor-category-101637260623847.html
19-11-2021||Noida||Noida: Demand grows for fire safety audit in housing societies||The fire which broke out in the Gardenia Golf City in Noida’s Sector 75 on Thursday has sparked panic among residents, who are now demanding that a fire safety audit be conducted in all the housing complexes in Noida to check if the residential towers have the necessary apparatus to douse a fire. Residents alleged most of the residential towers are yet to obtain fire safety clearances and that the government is doing little to address the issue. According to sources, at least 50,000 housing units in at least 50 newly built towers of different residential societies are occupied without the occupancy certificate issued by the Noida authority. This means at least 50 newly built residential towers are yet to put in place the necessary apparatus for controlling fires, which is mandatory if one has to obtain the occupancy certificate (OC). Many old residential towers also lack the requisite safety systems, said apartment owners. According to the provisions of the building bylaws, a building can be occupied only after the Noida authority issues an OC after inspection. The authority issues the OC after scrutinising multiple documents, including the fire safety clearance from the fire department. If a building does not have fire safety clearance--which is issued after the developer installs the fire safety apparatus, then the OC too is withheld and the building cannot be occupied on safety grounds. “We have learnt that many old and new buildings, such as Golf City in Sector 75, do not have the fire safety systems in place, thus putting people’s lives at risk. We demand a fire safety audit without any further delay; our previous request also failed to yield results,” said Rajiva Singh, president of Noida Federation of Apartment Owners Association (NFAOA), an umbrella body of all AOAs in Noida.The Noida authority said it will look into the issue and take action immediately.“We do not issue OC without fire safety clearances...The authority will carry out the fire safety audit as and when we receive the applications from the apartment owners or residents,” said Avinash Tripathi, officer on special duty, Noida authority.In April 2017, the fire department had assured residents to carry out a fire safety audit of all big buildings after a fire damaged a four-floor factory in Sector 11, killing six people and injuring one. The factory was allegedly operating without an OC. But no action has been taken till date. Residents said there are many lapses in terms of fire safety in most of the buildings such as defunct sprinklers, little space for movement of fire tenders, lack of water pipes in many housing societies, no mock drill in residential towers and even the response of the fire department is very poor.“We will look into the issue and find out if there are such lapses in the buildings of Noida. We will ask officials to submit a report on this matter.If it is true, then we will carry out a fire safety audit, in coordination with the Noida authority, ” said Aman Sharma, deputy director of Uttar Pradesh fire services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-demand-grows-for-fire-safety-audit-in-housing-societies-101637260623261.html
19-11-2021||Mumbai||Construction of GMLR twin tunnels in Mumbai likely to kick off by next year||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is expected to start construction work on the much-awaited Goregaon Mulund Link Road (GMLR) underground tunnels by mid-2022. While the work on the twin tunnels will take time, BMC officials said the project of connecting Western and Eastern Express Highways with two flyovers will kick off in the next two months.Officials said the project is currently at an advanced stage of tender and the bids are under scrutiny. Once the construction starts next year, the project may be ready by 2025.Although the total cost of the project is pegged at over ₹ 6,000 crore, it is expected that the cost will go up considering the project is at the tender stage for two years. As part of the construction of GMLR below the Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP), BMC has proposed 4.75-km-long tunnels that will run under SGNP. The reserved forest area affected by the tunnels is around 19.43 hectares. The tunnels will run 20 metres (m) below the ground level of the national park up to 200m at selected spots. GMLR is a 14-km-long east-west connector, beginning near the Western Express Highway at Goregaon, and ending near Nahur station in the East.According to BMC officials, the tunnels will be dug with the tunnel boring machine (TBM) technology, which was used to dig the underground Metro-3 corridor and coastal road project. P Velrasu, additional civic commissioner, said, “The tenders for GMLR tunnels is at an advanced stage and we will finalise them in the coming months.”A BMC official from the bridges department said, “The construction of the tunnels is expected to start only by mid-2022. However, the two flyovers are expected to be approved by this month-end. By December end, work on these flyovers can take off.”The GMLR project aims to improve east-west connectivity in the suburbs for which BMC had approached firms in Korea, Japan, China, Hong Kong and other places.Once appointed, stakeholders will draft the design and methodology to construct the tunnels. However, Chinese companies were barred from bidding for the project.What is a TBM?TBM is a highly-mechanised earth pressure balance (EPB) device that is used around 20-25 metres below the ground to construct tunnels with a circular cross-section.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/construction-of-gmlr-twin-tunnels-in-mumbai-likely-to-kick-off-by-next-year-101637260504475.html
19-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Man wanted for murder of 91-year-old man in 2019 arrested||A man, wanted for the murder of a 91-year-old man in September 2019, was arrested by the Delhi Police’s crime branch on Wednesday. Police said the man, identified as Nishant Khan, has been in hiding since the murder and was arrested based on information they gleaned from five others arrested in the case, including mastermind Kishan. According to the police, Kishan, who was working as a domestic help for elderly couple Saroj Khosla and her husband Krishan Dev Khosla, residents of CR Park in south Delhi, allegedly drugged the couple and made off with valuables from the house, the police said. Saroj Khosla told police that when she regained consciousness, she found her husband and Kishan missing along with some valuables from the house. Police later found the elderly man’s body in Sangam Vihar, where it was stuffed inside a refrigerator and then buried in the ground. “We were on the lookout for Khan after receiving information about his whereabouts from the other arrested suspects. We came to know that he was hiding in Batla House area. We conducted a search on Wednesday and arrested him,” said deputy commissioner of police (crime) Manoj C. Narrating the details of the 2019 case, the DCP said, “Kishan along with the other suspects Nishant Khan, Deepak, Pradeep Sharma, Mushir Khan, Prabhu Dayal and Sarvesh, conspired to rob his employer’s house and also to extort a ransom from the family after kidnapping his employer. The plan was to release the man after the ransom was paid, and escape to Nepal. As per the plan, Kishan give sedatives to the couple. It was Mushir who arranged the place where the body was later buried. He took a house on rent and also dug a pit with help of labourers to bury the body.” “After the couple fell unconscious, they robbed the house of valuables and murdered the elderly man. The body was hidden in a refrigerator at the house itself. That fridge was later shifted to the rented house in a hired vehicle and buried there with the body still stuffed inside. They withdrew money using Khosla’s ATM card. We arrested all suspects, except Khan, soon after the crime ,” said DCP Manoj.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiman-wanted-for-murder-of-91-year-old-man-in-2019-arrested-101637260503314.html
19-11-2021||Gurugram||3 areas in Gurugram declared as containment zones as Covid cases increase||The district administration on Thursday declared three residential areas containment zones in the wake of a rise in Covid-19 cases. According to the health department, these areas are The Belaire on Golf Course Road, from where three positive cases were reported, Central Park Resort on Sohna Road and Sector 46 (near a private school), where four cases were reported each. Gurugram recorded a Covid-related death on Wednesday, taking the district’s total toll to 925. “This is the second Covid-related fatality in November. The woman who died was 75 years old and had comorbidities--a prior heart ailment, asthma, hypertension, and diabetes,” said Gurugram chief medical officer (CMO), Dr Virender Yadav. On Monday, a 71-year-old man died of Covid-19. He was fully vaccinated and had comorbidities, according to district health officials. On Thursday, the district reported 13 new Covid-19 cases while 18 people recovered from the infection. There are 80 active Covid-19 cases in the district, of which 72 are in home isolation and eight are hospitalised. Officials said 10,215 people were vaccinated on Thursday, with 3,763 people being administered the first dose and 6,452 the second dose. Over 3.73 million people have been vaccinated in Gurugram so far. The district administration on Thursday issued an order authorising the sub-divisional magistrates (SDMs) and police to define the perimeter of the containment zones. Officials said that the perimeter of the containment zone in the three areas will be restricted to a three-kilometre radius from the point where the Covid-19 cases have been reported.Yash Garg, deputy commissioner of Gurugram, said that police are demarcating the perimeter by barricading and sealing the entry and exit points around the three-kilometre radius. “We have asked the police to set up barricades in the area so that specific entry and exit points can be closed. We are trying to create awareness about the perimeter through announcements,” he said. CMO Dr Yadav said that they have already completed contact tracing of all affected families in the three areas. “We asked the district administration to declare these areas as containment zones to ensure the cases are not spread. People with symptoms or even primary and secondary contacts of a Covid-19 patient should mask up and isolate themselves immediately. Though the number of positive cases is low, people still have to be careful and should avoid stepping out unnecessarily,” he said. He said that after festivals and during the ongoing wedding season, the city is witnessing a surge in Covid-19 cases. “We have requested police to direct the area station house officers concerned to ensure strict home isolation of Covid-19 patients,” he said. The residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) of the area have also been informed, said police. Rajkumar Yadav, the president of Sector 46 RWA, said that they have not received any information regarding positive cases. “We have formed a team to ensure that essential needs are delivered at their doorstep and the families are provided an ambulance for any medical emergency. Also, the sanitation of the area will be taken care of,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/3-areas-in-gurugram-declared-as-containment-zones-as-covid-cases-increase-101637260446055.html

19-11-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad Development Authority selects land for parking spaces at RRTS stations||The Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) has identified and finalised the proposal for land to be made available for vehicle parking at five of the total seven stations of the Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) project, officials said on Thursday.GDA officials said that a minimum of 2,000-square-metre (sqm) land was identified for parking for the project, and it is also included in the proposed Master Plan 2031 which will be finalised soon.The National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC), implementing the 82-kilometre-long RRTS project pegged at ₹30,274 crore -- which is proposed to link Delhi, Ghaziabad and Meerut with high-speed train connectivity, and is scheduled to be commissioned in 2025.A part of it -- about 40km of the route -- falls under the jurisdiction of Ghaziabad, where the NCRTC is developing RRTS stations at Sahibabad (land not found), Ghaziabad (already has parking provisions), Guldhar, Duhai, Muradnagar, Modinagar (South and North).“In wake of the ridership and utility of the project for commuters, we have identified land at five stations, where at least 2,000sqm of land has been identified. At Modinagar (south) station, the land area is nearly 3,000sqm. A provision for parking at the Ghaziabad station is already included in the project. Besides, we could not find any land for parking near the Sahibabad station,” said Asheesh Shivpuri, chief architect and town planner, GDA.“The land will be handed over to NCRTC for development and maintenance. It is expected that a 2,000sqm land will cater to nearly 84 cars or 400-500 two-wheelers. The proposal has also been included in the upcoming Master Plan 2031 and sent to the state government for approval,” Shivpuri added.According to estimates of GDA officials, a car for parking and taking turns among others require at least 24sqm of space. More two-wheelers will be seen at stations like Modinagar, Muradnagar and Duhai among others, and stations in the city will comparatively have more cars, they said.According to the detailed project report, the estimated ridership of the RRTS project is about eight lakh passengers per day. The NCRTC is taking up a 17km stretch between Sahibabad and Duhai in Ghaziabad -- as a priority stretch -- which will be the first stretch opened for commuter operation in India. It is likely to be opened for passenger operation by March 2023.Meanwhile, NCRTC officials said that they are working with the local administration and government authorities closely to provide parking spaces, and park-and-ride provisions according to the requirement of particular stations and land availability.“At RRTS station locations, service roads are being provisioned to segregate station-bound traffic from regular road traffic for smooth traffic operations, and to avoid traffic congestions. In addition, for efficient multimodal integration, various space provisions are being made for proper pick-up and drop facilities for various modes bound to RRTS station locations for efficient traffic dispersal,” said Puneet Vats, chief public relations officer (PRO) of NCRTC.The RRTS project is set to offer a better experience to the commuters, and will also enable shift of commuters from private to public transport, according to the officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-development-authority-selects-land-for-parking-spaces-at-rrts-stations-101637260326326.html
19-11-2021||Delhi||SC to hear plea against appointment of Rakesh Asthana as Delhi CP next week||The Supreme Court will hear next week a petition challenging the appointment of Rakesh Asthana as commissioner of Delhi Police. On July 27, the 1984-batch IPS officer of Gujarat cadre was appointed Delhi Police commissioner for a one year term with just four days remaining for his superannuation.A petition pending on this issue was taken up for hearing on Thursday before a bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and AS Bopanna.The petitioner – Centre for Public Interest Litigation – represented by advocate Prashant Bhushan informed the court that a judgment on the same issue was delivered by the Delhi high court on October 12 upholding the appointment of Asthana. Bhushan requested the court to consider his petition in the light of the October 12 order.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta appearing for Centre objected to this suggestion and told the bench that once the high court had passed its decision, the CPIL petition will not be maintainable. Only an appeal against the high court order can be heard, Mehta added.He was supported by counsel for Asthana, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, who informed the court that the appeal alone was sufficient to be heard and not the petition.The bench said, “We will not direct the petitioner to file an appeal. But to obviate technicality, would the petitioner not be well advised to also file an appeal against the HC judgment, so that in the final hearing this should not come in the way.”Bhushan agreed to file the appeal, and the bench allowed the appeal to be filed by Monday ordering the petition to come up for hearing with the fresh appeal on Friday.The petition questioned Asthana’s appointment on the ground that no panel of names was formed by Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) as held by the Supreme Court in Prakash Singh case. Also, a clear direction to ensure a secured, two-year tenure for DGP stood violated with the one-year appointment of Asthana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/scto-hear-plea-against-appointment-of-rakesh-asthana-as-delhi-cp-next-week-101637260325144.html
19-11-2021||Mumbai||District Mental Health Programme to be rolled out in Mumbai soon||The Centre-funded District Mental Health Programme (DMHP), which is already running in 34 districts of Maharashtra, is likely to be rolled out soon in Mumbai. To start with, the Centre has sanctioned posts of two psychiatrists and other required staff in the programme, which is likely to be approved by next year. The DMHP is implemented by the Directorate of Health Services (DHS) in all states. The programme consists of seven posts in each district including a psychiatrist, clinical psychologist, psychiatric nurse, psychiatric social worker, community nurse among other staff. “We had put up a proposal under the Programme Implementation Plan (PIP). The posts will be sanctioned over the next few months,” said Dr Sadhana Tayade, Director of DHS, Maharashtra. Mumbai has a strong network of medical facilities under the BMC. Thus, newer programmes can often lead to replication. To avoid this, the DHS plans to get a non-profit organisation to conduct a preliminary survey and find the gaps in mental health facilities in the city. “The challenges in Mumbai can be very different compared to the other 34 districts in Maharashtra, as the city is very populated and has a larger migrant population,” said Dr Padmaja Jogewar, Joint Director (non-communicable diseases), DHS. “The pandemic has led to a spurt in mental health issues and rolling out this programme will only help cater to a larger population,” she said. While funding from the Centre is crucial, finding psychiatrists is a major challenge, said DHS officials. At present, there are 41 posts of psychiatrists sanctioned under DMHP in the state, but 11 are currently vacant. “Filling the vacancies is our utmost priority. We have given out many advertisements and have also conducted interview sessions,” said Dr Tayade. The Bellary ModelThe DMHP was started in 1996 under the National Mental Health Programme (NMHP) by the Centre. It aims at early detection and treatment of common mental illnesses with a limited number of drugs under the guidance of a specialist. Health workers are trained to identify signs of mental illnesses, spread public awareness and monitor. This four-point concept is known as the ‘Bellary Model’, as it was first implemented in the Bellary district of Karnataka. The DMHP staff regularly visit villages and households to conduct awareness sessions in schools and colleges, in an effort to raise awareness in the community.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/district-mental-health-programme-to-be-rolled-out-in-mumbai-soon-101637260263312.html
19-11-2021||Noida||12 shops gutted, 16 flats damaged in fire at Noida’s Sec 75 Gardenia Golf City||Twelve shops were gutted and about 16 flats damaged after a fire broke at a shop in the Golf City Circle Mart of Gardenia Golf City in Noida’s Sector 75 early Thursday morning.Police said residents safely evacuated from the 16-storey towers of the housing complex as soon as the fire started and no one was injured. However, the value of the goods and property damaged is yet to be ascertained. According to developers of the housing project, there are 1,026 flats in 13 towers, of which 650 flats are occupied. Residents have been living here since 2017 and the shops too became operational around the same time. Vikram Singh Yadav, president of the society’s market association, said there are 43 shops and departmental stores on the ground floor. “A security guard spotted the fire in a shop around 4am Thursday. The guard immediately alerted police and other officials. Residents swiftly evacuated the flats,” said Yadav.A spot visit by HT showed that 12 shops in a row were gutted. The flames also spread upwards and reached up to the eighth floor of two towers, partially damaging 16 flats.The Aims Max Gardenia Developers is currently looking after the maintenance of the society. Basant Kumar Upadhyay, general manager, Gardenia Golf City, said the fire originated from a snacks shop on the ground floor.“The security guards first tried to extinguish the fire but they failed as it quickly spread. The guards then broke the shop’s shutter, and the air from outside facilitated the spread of the fire to the other shops,” said Upadhyay.He said only three shops were gutted while others suffered minor damages. “As the flames spread upwards, the windows, DTH antennas, and air-conditioners of a few flats in towers I and J were damaged,” he said.HT spoke to a few shopkeepers, who said each of them has incurred losses to the tune of ₹5-6 lakh. Sushila Gautam, a sweet shop owner, said her shop was gutted in the fire. “My staff closed shop at 10.30pm on Wednesday and went home. Around 7am on Thursday, someone informed me about the fire. I have no idea what to do now,” said 65-year-old Gautam, who had been running the shop for two years. Afzal Ahmad, owner of Looks Salon, said he owned two shops and one of them was damaged by the fire.Residents said fire tenders reached the spot around 5am, an hour after the fire broke out.Sanjeev Singh, fire safety officer, Noida 1, said the fire department received a call at 4.35am. “We reached the spot in 20 minutes. Eight fire tenders brought the fire under control in half an hour. It seems that a short circuit in the snacks shop led to the fire. Thankfully, no one was injured,” he said. Residents have expressed concerns over the safety of the housing complex. “This is a serious safety concern. Mostly, the shops are run by workers and not by the shop owners. There is no security check for them. The concerned officials should conduct a safety audit of the shops,” said a resident of the housing complex requesting anonymity.Meanwhile, developers of the housing complex said they are repairing the flats. “We are replacing the windows and other things that have been damaged. We have also called a meeting with the shopkeepers and residents on Saturday to discuss the issue and take safety measures,” Upadhyay said. Vinod Kumar, station house officer of Sector 49 police station, said he has not received any complaint regarding the fire incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/12-shops-gutted-16-flats-damaged-in-fire-at-noida-s-sec-75-gardenia-golf-city-101637260204737.html
19-11-2021||Delhi||Kejriwal announces new 6-point plan to clean Yamuna||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced on Thursday a six-point action plan to clean the Yamuna by February 2025 by improving the city’s sewage treatment capacity and network, cleaning major drains, de-silting storm water drains and taking action against industries releasing untreated waste, among other measures.Kejriwal at a digital press briefing reminded people of his key promise during the 2020 assembly elections of cleaning the river in the next five years and bathing in it to demonstrate its cleanliness. “Yamuna is close to everyone in Delhi. It is the lifeline of Delhi. Everyone wants to see a clean Yamuna. It took 70 years to dirty the river Yamuna. All the dirt of 70 years cannot be cleaned in two days. But, we have now prepared a six-point action plan to clean the Yamuna by February 2025. We have started work on these points on war footing,” he said.The first action point is increasing the city’s sewage treatment capacity and improving the quality of treatment. At present, Kejriwal said, Delhi has the capacity to treat only about 600 MGD of sewage because of which a lot of it is left untreated and released directly into the Yamuna. “The city actually needs sewage treatment plants (STPs) with a total capacity of 800-850 MGD. We are doing three things on this front: 1) Setting up new sewage treatment plants such as the coronation plant and the ones being built at Okhla, Kondli, Rithala and so on; 2) Increasing the capacity of the existing plants; 3) Existing plants are operating with old technology because of which even treated water is dirty and not up to the mark. We will upgrade the technology to ensure the released treated water is of 10/10 purity as per the normal standards,” he said.The second action point is in-situ cleaning of the city’s major drains. Kejriwal said the Najafgarh drain, Badshahpur drain, supplementary drain and Ghazipur drain will be cleaned on the spot with a new technology without diverting its waste to another plant. The remaining drains, he said, will be diverted to the city’s STPs.The third action point, Kejriwal said, would be to properly treat industrial waste and take action against units that do not adhere to the set norms. “A lot of industries on paper show that all their waste is being released only after proper treatment. But, the reality is that industrial waste treatment is practically not happening at present. All the effluent treatment plants that are not operating properly will be repaired and upgraded. The industries which fail to send their waste to effluent treatment plants will be shut down,” he said.The fourth focus point will be community toilets built in different slum clusters and jhuggis of Delhi. “At present, the waste from all the community toilets in jhuggis is released into storm water drains as a result of which their sewage is released directly into the river. These will be diverted and linked to sewage lines instead, so that the waste is treated properly,” the chief minister said.The fifth action point will be to increase household sewage connections in the city. “Many people still haven’t taken sewer connections in the city. Many households release their sewage directly into the local nullahs. We have decided that the Delhi government, on its own, will put sewer connections in people’s houses. They will not have to apply or seek permission from us. We will charge a nominal rate which will be adjusted in their water bills,” Kejriwal said.The sixth point will be de-silting and rehabilitation of the city’s entire existing sewer network. “I am personally monitoring this project. We have set specific milestones for each action point and I will ensure that the deadlines are not missed,” Kejriwal said.The Yamuna enters Delhi near Palla and travels about 48km through the city. The 22km stretch between Wazirabad to Okhla is the most polluted where 2% of the overall river length contributes to 70% of total pollution in the river, as the erstwhile Yamuna Monitoring Committee has repeatedly highlighted in its reports.Dumping of raw sewage, untreated industrial pollutants and solid waste are the key causes of pollution in the river. The three biggest drains contributing to the Yamuna pollution are Najafgarh, Supplementary and Shahdara drain.Manoj Mishra, convener of the Yamuna Jiye Abhiyan, said that of the action points announced by the government on Thursday, the tackling of industrial pollutants should be the immediate priority. “We have seen during the lockdown period in 2020 that Yamuna can be cleaner if industrial pollution can be checked and the ecological flow in the river can be ensured. The river has no future unless we ensure an ecological flow in it. Otherwise, no matter what we do, the conditions will not improve,” he remarked.Diwan Singh, another Yamuna activist who led a satyagraha for cleaning the river in 2007, said the actions of all previous government do not inspire confidence that the Yamuna can be cleaned by 2025. “Even when the AAP came to power, they announced that the river will be cleaned in 4-5 years but not an iota of difference in the condition of the river can be seen. The city continues to grow in an unplanned manner and the goalpost keeps shifting. Unless we tackle our urbanisation mess, the river cannot be cleaned. We will remain in this catch 22 situation,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/kejriwal-announces-new-6-point-plan-to-clean-yamuna-101637259843413.html

Yogi, who has been pushing major development projects, is also leaving no opportunity to make the maximum use of time and ensure that all the projects are launched before the model code of conduct comes into force for the 2022 polls.“Yes, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, too, appears to be in election mode. As a good politician, he is making the maximum use of time to launch projects before the Election Commission’s code of conduct comes into force. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath is also using time in the best possible way to ensure the launch of the projects goes well ahead of the polls,” said Professor SK Dwivedi, former head of the department of political science at Lucknow University.Leader of opposition in the state assembly and senior Samajwadi Party leader Ram Govind Chaudhary said, “The prime minister is making frequent visits to the state obviously because of the 2022 assembly elections. He may come an umpteen number of times but the people of state have now made up their mind for installing the Akhilesh Yadav led Samajwadi Party government in 2022 polls in Uttar Pradesh.” On the other hand, UP BJP spokesman Chandra Mohan said, “Under Prime Minister’s leadership, the BJP got the mandate in Uttar Pradesh. The BJP has resolved to make a new Uttar Pradesh. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath is taking the state in the direction of making a new Uttar Pradesh. The Opposition has nothing to say and so its leaders are making unnecessary comments.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/frequency-of-pm-modi-s-visits-to-uttar-pradesh-set-to-increase-ahead-of-assembly-polls-101637258643511.html

The next date of hearing in the case has been fixed on December 2. The ED arrested Khaira, a former Punjab MLA, on November 11 under provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The central probe agency had raided his premises in March this year. The ED has alleged that Khaira was an accomplice of a drug case convicts and fake passport racketeers. The ED told the court they have to probe the source of funds that Khaira got from the US for the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in 2016. The ED said Khaira was issued notices four times, but he did not cooperate. Opposing the remand, Khaira’s lawyers Keshav Chaudhary and PS Walia pleaded in the drugs case stay was obtained from the Supreme Court. So, the ED couldn’t have arrested himKhaira alleged that his arrest was the result of some “Congress insiders’ vendetta” and handwork of “devils in disguise”. Khaira won the assembly election in 2017 from the Bholath seat on the AAP ticket. He resigned from the membership of the AAP in January 2019 and floated his own outfit, Punjab Ekta Party. He then joined the Congress in June this year. Plea in HC against arrest deferred to November 23Sukhpal Khaira’s plea against his arrest could not be taken up in the high court on Thursday and the hearinghas been deferred for November 23. The plea demands his release terming the arrest“bad in law”.It argues that ED initiated proceedings under the PMLA even as there is a stay from Supreme Court in the 2015 matter.

Delegation of the BJP has offered there a prayer for high spirit and prosperity of Punjab, apart from the wellbeing of all. We also did ardas for peace and brotherhood in the state, besides seeking our country getting prosperous and most powerful in the world,” Sharma said on his return.“Prime Minister Modi has provided us the opportunity of paying obeisance at the gurdwara by reopening this corridor after the pandemic eased. This corridor has been reopened in view of the devotion of the Sikh sangat (community),” he had said before leaving for the shrine, where Guru Nanak spent 17 years of his life. Replying to a query on the arrangements and treatment of officials on the Pakistan side, he said, “What a wonderful environment there was! It was full of tranquility. I would like to ask all to avail this opportunity to visit this pious place.

19-11-2021||World||Sri Lanka reports new sub-lineage of Covid-19’s Delta variant||Researchers in Sri Lanka on Friday detected a new sub-lineage of the Delta variant of Covid-19. This is the third mutation of the coronavirus which originated in the island nation, news agency PTI reported. The health officials have named the variant B.1.617.2. AY 104.Sri Lankan health authorities are yet to ascertain the transmissibility of sub-lineage and have sent the sample to laboratories in Hong Kong for further analysis. Researchers at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura were the first to detect the sub-lineage AY-104.The university’s director of molecular and cell biology department, Dr Chandima Jeewadara, said that AY-104 took the total number of variants originating from Sri Lanka to three.“The first one was B.411, which is a lineage of the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus, the second was B.1.617.2. AY 28 and this is the third one (B.1.617.2. AY 104,” he was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.The SARS-CoV-2 Delta (B.1.617.2) variant is highly transmissible and was responsible for the rapid uptick in coronavirus cases across the globe, even in populations with higher rates of vaccination.Jeewadara said the new variant was detected in north, north-central and southern provinces of the state while further adding that other strains were detected in western province and capital Colombo. He further added that 288 samples were confirmed for AY 104 while 479 tested positive for the AY 28 variant. The AY 104 variant was found after tests were conducted on random samples.Sri Lankan health authorities are monitoring fresh Covid-19 clusters in the nation's north central and southern provinces. They have attributed it to people flouting Covid-19 guidelines during social functions. Sri Lanka’s health minister Keheliya Rambukwella said over 75% of the 16 years of age and 61.8% of the total population received both doses of Covid-19 vaccine. Over 160,000 Sri Lankans over 60 years have also received the Pfizer-BioNTech jab as a third or booster dose as of Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sri-lanka-reports-new-sub-lineage-of-covid-19-s-delta-variant-101637342355042.html
19-11-2021||World||Interior secretary seeks to remove derogatory US place names||US interior secretary Deb Haaland on Friday declared “squaw” to be a derogatory term and said she is taking steps to remove the term from federal government use and to replace other derogatory place names.Haaland is ordering a federal panel tasked with naming geographic places to implement procedures to remove what she called racist terms from federal use.“Our nation’s lands and waters should be places to celebrate the outdoors and our shared cultural heritage — not to perpetuate the legacies of oppression,” Haaland said in a statement. “Today’s actions will accelerate an important process to reconcile derogatory place names and mark a significant step in honoring the ancestors who have stewarded our lands since time immemorial.”The first Native American to hold a cabinet position, Haaland is from Laguna Pueblo in New Mexico.Under Haaland's order, a federal task force will find replacement names for geographic features on federal lands bearing the term “squaw,” which has been used as a slur, particularly for indigenous women. A database maintained by the Board on Geographic Names shows there are currently more than 650 federal sites with names that contain the term.The task force will be made up of representatives from federal land management agencies and experts with the Interior Department. Tribal consultation and public feedback will be part of the process.The process for changing US place names can take years and federal officials said there are currently hundreds of proposed name changes pending before the board.Haaland also called for the creation of an advisory committee to solicit, review and recommend changes to other derogatory geographic and federal place names. That panel will be made up of tribal representatives and civil rights, anthropology and history experts.In the 1960s and 1970s, the Board of Geographic Names took action to eliminate the use of derogatory terms for Blacks and Japanese.There is legislation pending in Congress to address derogatory names on geographic features on public lands. States from Oregon to Maine have passed legislation prohibiting the use of the word “squaw” in place names.In 2020, the Phoenix City Council voted unanimously to rename Squaw Peak Drive to Piestewa Peak Drive, in honor of fallen Native American soldier Lori Piestewa, after it was decried as a demeaning and degrading word.The move came after the council approved a measure that would give the city the right to re-name derogatory street names without residents’ consent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/interior-secretary-seeks-to-remove-derogatory-us-place-names-101637338807859.html

She is scheduled to travel to Ohio later on Friday once Biden resumes his duties.Biden drove early Friday to the medical center in the Washington suburbs for his first routine physical exam as president. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden would be under anesthesia during the procedure and would transfer power to Harris.“As was the case when president George W. Bush had the same procedure in 2002 and 2007, and following the process set out in the Constitution, President Biden will transfer power to the Vice President for the brief period of time when he is under anesthesia,” she said. “The vice-president will work from her office in the West Wing during this time.”Biden, 78, had his last full exam in December 2019, when doctors found the former vice president to be “healthy, vigorous” and “fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency,” according to a doctor’s report at the time.Biden, who turns 79 on Saturday, is the oldest person to serve as president, and interest in his health has been high since he declared his candidacy for the White House in 2019.Dr. Kevin O’Connor, who has been Biden’s primary care physician since 2009, wrote in a three-page note that the then-presidential candidate was in overall good shape.In that report, O’Connor said that since 2003, Biden has had episodes of atrial fibrillation, a type of irregular heartbeat that’s potentially serious but treatable. At the time, O’Connor cited a list of tests that showed Biden’s heart was functioning normally and his only needed care was a blood thinner to prevent the most worrisome risk, blood clots or stroke.Biden had a brush with death in 1988, requiring surgery to repair two brain aneurysms, weak bulges in arteries, one of them leaking. Biden has never had a recurrence, his doctor said, citing a test in 2014 that examined his arteries.On Friday afternoon, Biden is scheduled to take part in the annual pardoning of the national Thanksgiving turkey.When Biden took office he brought O’Connor back to the White House to continue serving as his doctor, and O'Connor was expected to lead a team of experts in conducting Biden's physical exam Friday.Once the Covid-19 pandemic emerged in early 2020, Biden’s team took intense steps to keep the then-candidate and now-president healthy as the virus raged and took a disproportionate toll among older populations. Biden received his first dose of the Covid-19 vaccines in December 2020 and his second dose just two weeks before taking office. He received a booster dose, which regulators say provides more enduring protection, in late September.The White House said Biden would authorise the release of a medical report, as is customary for presidents and presidential candidates. Former President Donald Trump, 75, was sharply criticized for releasing only cursory details on his health while running and serving in the White House, including concealing the seriousness of his Covid-19 illness a month before the 2020 presidential election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-to-get-us-presidential-powers-for-a-brief-moment-here-s-why-101637335927644.html

These countries also tightened restrictions and Austria became the first European nation to impose a nationwide lockdown to curb the recent spread of Covid-19.'Dramatic situation'German vice chancellor Angela Merkel urged citizens to get vaccinated as the German government introduced tighter restrictions to curb the nation’s highest Covid-19 infection levels since the onset of the pandemic. “The situation is extremely dramatic,” Merkel said.German health minister Jens Spahn also said that Germany may have to transfer Covid-19 patients from one region to another or even to neighbouring nations for treatment. “We are getting to a point where we will have to transfer Covid patients not just within the same region, but to other regions within Germany. And quite possibly even to neighbouring countries,” Spahn was quoted as saying by news agency Deutsche Welle.Germany recorded 52,970 daily new infections on Friday. Bavaria, the German state, canceled all of its popular Christmas markets due to the rise in Covid-19 cases.Austria imposes lockdownAustria imposed a national lockdown to curb cases and asked the entire population to get fully vaccinated by February. “We have not succeeded in convincing enough people to get vaccinated. It hurts that such measures still have to be taken,” Austrian chancellor Alexander Schallenberg said.“There are too many among us who haven’t shown solidarity. Raising the vaccination rate is the only way to break this vicious circle,” Schallenberg was quoted as saying by news agency Bloomberg.The nationwide lockdown will begin from Monday. The nation reported 15,609 new cases in the last 24 hours, the highest since the onset of the pandemic.Russia continues to report record Covid-19 deathsRussia continued to report record Covid-19 deaths on Friday as it recorded 1,254 fresh fatalities along with 37,156 new confirmed cases. It reported 1,251 deaths on Thursday and 1,247 deaths on Wednesday.Russian authorities blamed the recent surge in infection levels on lax attitudes among people and low vaccination rates. Out of Russia’s 146 million people only 40% have been fully vaccinated despite the nation launching Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine ahead of the entire world.The recent spike in cases in Europe have also led to fear among investors who feel that measures to curb the cases could delay the economic recovery. Oil prices also fell on Friday to $78 a barrel as European markets struggled due to the recent surge in cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/record-covid-19-infection-levels-lockdowns-mar-festive-cheer-in-europe-101637333497892.html
19-11-2021||World||Pfizer, Moderna Covid-19 booster shots cleared for all US adults. Final hurdle remains||The United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the federal agency responsible for the control and supervision of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccines, on Friday, opened up booster shots manufactured by Pfizer and Moderna to all adults – expanding the government's campaign to shore up protection and get ahead of rising infections that may worsen with the holidays.What the latest decision, taken by the FDA, implies is that either of the Pfizer or Moderna Covid-19 booster shots can now be administered to anyone 18 or older six months after their last dose – regardless of which vaccine they had at first. However, there still remains the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which must yet agree to expand the Pfizer and Moderna boosters to even healthy young adults. A panel of experts who advise the CDC on vaccine policies are expected to review the evidence and make further guidance for administering booster shots at a meeting on Friday afternoon.If the CDC agrees, tens of millions more Americans could have three doses of protection ahead of the new year. Anyone who got the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine can already get a booster.According to the CDC, more than a third of fully vaccinated senior citizens in the US had already received their booster doses as of Thursday, and 17 per cent of fully vaccinated adults overall have had an additional shot of vaccine.Multiple states in the US –  including Arkansas, California, Colorado, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, New Mexico, and even New York City – have already opted to make booster doses broadly available. In many of those areas, cases are climbing after a slowdown in the summer’s delta-variant-fueled surge.All three Covid-19 vaccines used in the US still offer strong protection against severe illness including hospitalisation and death, but protection against infection can wane with time. (With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-moderna-covid-19-booster-shots-cleared-for-all-us-adults-final-hurdle-remains-101637329549242.html

We demand the Lithuanian side immediately correct its mistaken decision,” the statement said.“The Chinese government expresses strong protest over and firm objection to this extremely egregious act, and will take all necessary measures to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Lithuanian side shall be responsible for all the ensuing consequences,” said the spokesperson.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao later warned Lithuania that it would take “all necessary measures” to safeguard national sovereignty.In September, Lithuania had angered China when its defence ministry recommended that consumers avoid buying Chinese mobile phones and advised people to throw away the ones they have now after a government report found the devices had built-in censorship capabilities.Flagship phones sold in Europe by China’s smartphone giant Xiaomi Corp have a built-in ability to detect and censor terms such as “Free Tibet”, “Long live Taiwan independence” or “democracy movement”, Lithuania’s state-run cybersecurity body said on Tuesday, a Reuters report from Vilnius said in September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lithuania-will-pay-for-what-it-did-says-china-after-it-forges-ties-with-taiwan-101637319248445.html
19-11-2021||World||Covid-19: New study says ‘patient zero’ was vendor at seafood market in Wuhan||The first identified Covid-19 case was a vendor at a seafood market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan and not, as thought earlier, an accountant without any link to the market, a new study published in the journal, Science, said on Thursday.The identification of the account as the first patient with Covid-19 symptoms had added to the speculation that the virus could have leaked from a top virus laboratory located across the Yangtze river from the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, the first pandemic epicentre.The new study adds to the voices that have supported an animal-origin theory.The origin of the Sars-CoV-2 virus, which causes Covid-19 remains a mystery, and a major source of tension between China and several western countries led by the United States.Beijing has consistently denied the lab leak theory, calling it a conspiracy, and claiming instead that cases of the viral fever had been diagnosed in other countries before Wuhan.The new report indicates that the World Health Organization (WHO)-China inquiry into the origins had got the initial chronology of the outbreak wrong.As it turns out, according to virologist Michael Worobey, rather than the original patient being a man who had never been to the Wuhan market, the first known case of Covid-19 turns out to be a woman, a vendor at the market.“His (the accountant’s) symptom onset came after multiple cases in workers at Huanan market, making a female seafood vendor there the earliest known case, with illness onset on December 11,” according to the study done by Worobey, who is head of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Arizona.Worobey argues that community transmission of the disease started at the market. “Given the high transmissibility of Sars-CoV-2 and the high rate of asymptomatic spread, many symptomatic cases would inevitably soon lack a direct link to the location of the pandemic’s origin,” he wrote.“That so many of the >100 Covid-19 cases from December with no identified epidemiologic link to Huanan market nonetheless lived in its direct vicinity is notable and provides compelling evidence that community transmission started at the market,” Worobey said.The virologist went through publicly available data including hospital records and interviews of patients to arrive at this conclusion. “The strength of my article is that it draws on firsthand accounts - including audio/video recordings - of doctors, hospital administrators, and patients like Zhang Jixian, Xia Wenguang, Wei Guixian, Chen Honggang, Ai Fen, and Yuan Yufeng,” Worobey tweeted.“There was a tragic failure of China’s much-touted Pneumonia of Unknown Etiology (PUE) system, where doctors are supposed to report cases of unexplained pneumonia rapidly (I believe within hours) to national authorities through an internet-based platform,” Worobey tweeted.“The new study will add to the ongoing research into the origins of the worst global health crisis in several decades.The WHO proposed last month a new expert panel to investigate the source of the coronavirus.Chinese scientist Yungui Yang of the Beijing Institute of Genomics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences has been included in the Scientific Advisory Group on the Origins of Novel Pathogens (SAGO) - the only Chinese expert named in the 25-member panel.China has warned against “political manipulation” of the renewed WHO probe into the origins of the coronavirus while adding that it would support the investigation.Beijing has dismissed accusations of withholding critical data during an earlier WHO probe into the origins in February, alleging that the investigation had been politicised by the US and that the scope of the search should be widened to other countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-new-study-says-patient-zero-was-vendor-at-seafood-market-in-wuhan-101637318411175.html

19-11-2021||World||Over 28,000 of Afghans seek temporary US entry, only few approved||More than 28,000 Afghans have applied for temporary admission into the U.S. for humanitarian reasons since shortly before the Taliban recaptured Afghanistan and sparked a chaotic U.S. withdrawal, but only about 100 of them have been approved, according to federal officials.U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has struggled to keep up with the surge in applicants to a little-used program known as humanitarian parole but promises it's ramping up staff to address the growing backlog.Afghan families in the U.S. and the immigrant groups supporting them say the slow pace of approvals threatens the safety of their loved ones, who face an uncertain future under the hard-line Islamic government because of their ties to the West.“We're worried for their lives,” says Safi, a Massachusetts resident whose family is sponsoring 21 relatives seeking humanitarian parole. “Sometimes, I think there will be a day when I wake up and receive a call saying that they're no more.”The 38-year-old U.S. permanent resident, who asked that her last name not be used for fear of retribution against her relatives, is hoping to bring over her sister, her uncle and their families. She says the families have been in hiding and their house was destroyed in a recent bombing because her uncle had been a prominent local official before the Taliban took over.The slow pace of approvals is frustrating because families have already paid hundreds if not thousands of dollars in processing fees, says Chiara St. Pierre, an attorney at the International Institute of New England in Lowell, Massachusetts, a refugee resettlement agency assisting Safi's family.Each parole application comes with a $575 filing charge, meaning USCIS, which is primarily fee-funded, is sitting on some $11.5 million from Afghans in the last few months alone, she and other advocates complain.“People are desperate to get their families out,” said St. Pierre, whose nonprofit has filed more than 50 parole applications for Afghan nationals. “Do we not owe a duty to the people left behind, especially when they are following our immigration laws and using the options they have?”Victoria Palmer, a USCIS spokesperson, said the agency has trained 44 additional staff to help address the application surge. As of mid-October, the agency had only six staffers detailed to the program.Of the more than 100 approved as of July 1, some are still in Afghanistan and some have made it to third countries, she said, declining to provide details. The program typically receives fewer than 2,000 requests annually from all nationalities, of which USCIS approves an average of about 500, according to Palmer.Part of the challenge is that humanitarian parole requires an in-person interview, meaning those in Afghanistan need to travel to another county with an operating U.S. embassy or consulate after they've cleared the initial screening. U.S. officials warn it could then take months longer, and there's no guarantee parole will be granted, even after the interview.Humanitarian parole doesn’t provide a path to lawful permanent residence or confer U.S. immigration status. It's meant for foreigners who are unable to go through the asylum or other traditional visa processes, but who need to leave their country urgently.The backlog of parole requests comes on top of the more than 73,000 Afghan refugees already evacuated from the country as part of Operations Allies Welcome, which was focused on Afghans who worked for the U.S. government as interpreters and in other jobs.Most have arrived in the country and have been staying on military bases awaiting resettlement in communities across the country, though about 2,000 still remain overseas awaiting clearance to enter the U.S., according to Palmer.But advocates question some of USCIS's recent decisions for Afghan humanitarian parole, such as prioritizing applications from those already living in other countries. They say that approach is at odds with the program's purpose of helping those most at risk.The Biden administration should instead focus on applications from women and girls, LGBTQ people and religious minorities still in the country, said Sunil Varghese, of the New York-based International Refugee Assistance Project.It could also dispense with some of the financial documentation required for applicants and their sponsors, since Congress has passed legislation making Afghan evacuees eligible for refugee benefits, said Lindsay Gray, CEO of Vecina, an Austin, Texas-based group that trains attorneys and volunteers on immigration matters.Palmer didn't directly address the critiques but said the agency, in each case, determines if there's a “distinct, well-documented reason” to approve humanitarian parole and whether other protections are available. USCIS also considers whether the person already has U.S. ties, such as a family member with legal status or prior work for the U.S. government, among other factors.In the meantime, Afghans in the U.S. have little choice but to wait and fret.Bahara, another Afghan living in Massachusetts who asked her last name be withheld over concerns for her family, says she’s been wracked with guilt for her decision to leave her country to attend a local university.The 29-year-old boarded a plane on Aug. 15 just hours before the Taliban swept into the capital of Kabul, leading to one of the largest mass evacuations in U.S. history.“It was my dream, but it changed completely,” said Bahara, referring to enrolling in a U.S. master’s degree program. “I couldn't stop thinking about my family. I couldn't sleep the first few weeks. All I did was cry, but it didn't help.”Bahara said her family is worried because Taliban officials have been paying unannounced visits to people like her father who worked with the U.S. government after the militant group was originally ousted from power by the U.S. following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.An American family is now sponsoring her family for humanitarian parole, giving Bahara hope even as she grieves over her country's current situation.“I cannot believe how everything just collapsed,” said Bahara, who founded a children's literacy program in Afghanistan. “All the achievements and hard work just added up to zero, and now people are suffering.”Baktash Sharifi Baki, a green-card holder who has been living in the U.S. since 2014, was compelled to take more drastic measures as Afghanistan quickly unraveled this summer.The Philadelphia resident, who served as an interpreter for the U.S. government, traveled back in August in the hopes of shepherding his wife, daughter, mother and godson to safety.But the family wasn’t able to board any of the final commercial flights out of Kabul. Baki has appealed to the U.S. government to allow them to board one of the charter flights that have recently resumed.Meanwhile, a friend in Louisiana has offered to serve as the family’s sponsor for a humanitarian parole application, even covering the costly fees himself.Baki and his family are staying for now with relatives in the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif. But he worries his modest cash savings is dwindling just as the region’s harsh winter sets in and Afghanistan's economic crisis is deepening.“We are really facing a bad situation here,” Baki said. “We need to get out.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-28-000-of-afghans-seek-temporary-us-entry-only-few-approved-101637305309168.html
19-11-2021||World||First Wuhan Covid case days later than initially reported: Scientist||The first case of Covid-19 identified in Wuhan, China and presented as such by the World Health Organization was actually days later than previously believed and at an animal market, a top scientist said in the journal Science Thursday.Rather than the original patient being a man who had never been to the Wuhan market where wild and domestic animals were sold, the first known case of Covid-19 turns out to have been a woman who had worked in the market, virologist Michael Worobey wrote.For Worobey, that key piece of information, and his analysis of other early cases of Covid-19 in the city, clearly tip the scales towards the virus having originated in an animal.With no definitive evidence, debate has raged among experts since the start of the pandemic almost two years ago over the origin of the virus.Worobey was one of the 15 or so experts who in mid-May published a column in Science demanding serious consideration of the thesis that the virus had leaked from a laboratory in Wuhan.In this latest article, he argued that his research into the origin of the outbreak "provides strong evidence of a live-animal market origin of the pandemic."One criticism of the market theory was that because health authorities raised the alert about cases of a suspicious disease linked to the market as early as December 30, 2019, that would have introduced a bias that led to the identification of more cases there than elsewhere, since attention had already been drawn to it.To counter that argument, Worobey analyzed cases reported by two hospitals before the alert was raised.Those cases were also largely linked to the market, and those which were not were nevertheless geographically concentrated around it."In this city of 11 million people, half of the early cases are linked to a place that's the size of a soccer field," Worobey told the New York Times."It becomes very difficult to explain that pattern if the outbreak didn't start at the market."Another criticism of the theory was based on the fact that the first case identified was unrelated to the market.But while the WHO report claimed the man originally identified as patient zero had been ill from December 8, he actually was not sick until December 16, according to Worobey.That deduction was based on a video interview he found, from a case described in a scientific article and from a hospital medical record that matched the 41-year-old man.That would mean the first reported case would be the woman who worked in the market, who fell ill on December 11.Peter Daszak, a disease expert who was on the WHO investigation team, said he was convinced by Worobey's analysis."That December 8 date was a mistake," he told the Times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-wuhan-covid-case-days-later-than-initially-reported-scientist-101637292474952.html

19-11-2021||World||Greece is the latest European country to restrict the unvaccinated||Greece will tighten restrictions on people unvaccinated against the coronavirus as rising cases and hospitalizations strain the nation’s health systems. It joins Germany, Austria and other European countries in attempting to pressure more people into getting their inoculations.  “Even those who are still hesitant can change their minds by listening to what the unvaccinated who get sick have to say,” Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said in a televised national address on Thursday. Almost nine out of every 10 people in Greek ICUs with Covid-19 are unvaccinated, he said. Mitsotakis said that from Monday, unvaccinated people will lose access to indoor venues including cinemas, theaters, gyms and museums. The government banned their entrance to restaurants, bars and cafes in early November.  “It is a direct act of protection and, of course, an indirect urge to be vaccinated,” Mitsotakis said. Unvaccinated people can still attend church with a negative test, he said. Since restrictions made in early November, Greece has reported some 100,000 new Covid-19 cases, more than the total number of cases for October, and almost 1,000 deaths, pushing total casualties since the start of the pandemic to more than 17,000. Greece’s vaccination numbers have also picked up this month after the earlier round of restrictions. Germany Applies Restrictions on Unvaccinated to Stem Covid SurgeMore than 195,000 people have had a first shot since Nov. 2, around the same as total inoculations in October. Greece started booster shots in late September, and from Friday the third vaccine will be available for everyone 18 years and older. About 65% of Greeks have had at least one vaccine dose, and 62% are fully immunized. That’s much lower than Western European countries like Spain and Italy, and similar to neighboring Turkey, where about 60% are fully vaccinated. As hospitalizations rise, the government on Thursday ordered private doctors to also work with the national health system. The premier said that a rotation system will apply to private and public sector workers to avoid crowding in rush hours on mass transportation. He also announced that those above 60 years old will need to do the third shot in order to keep their vaccination certificates current, and that he plans to request to the European Union president that the EU’s digital vaccine certification show whether people have had a third shot or not.   “Get vaccinated, get vaccinated, get vaccinated,” Mitsotakis said in closing his address.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/greece-is-the-latest-european-country-to-restrict-the-unvaccinated-101637281038350.html

The amount wasn’t disclosed. The news agency reported that the deal would cover content in all European Union countries for five years.Web platforms like Google and Facebook have long been reluctant to pay media for using content such as news article extracts in their user feeds. The EU’s so-called neighboring rights law passed in 2019 compelled them to strike payment agreements with the region’s publishers. Google and a group of French press titles excluding AFP struck an initial agreement in January. However, the French competition authority fined Google 500 million euros ($593 million) in July for having failed to negotiate “in good faith” with news outlets. Google appealed the fine.“This agreement with Agence France-Presse demonstrates our willingness to find common ground with publishers and press agencies in France on the topic of neighboring rights,” Sébastien Missoffe, managing director of Google France, said in the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-signs-5-yr-deal-to-pay-for-news-from-afp-101637271586591.html

Organizers are under scrutiny for their coronavirus-control measures, which include requiring vaccination for athletes and official delegations. The country is battling outbreaks of the virus in nearly two dozen provinces.A Polish luge coach complained earlier this month that the Chinese have focused more intently on preventing virus transmission than on basic safety measures after one of his athletes was severely injured in a practice run.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-says-us-considering-diplomatic-boycott-of-beijing-olympics-101637265433398.html

Another 30 had suffered breathing difficulties from tear gas inhalation.They said they had fired no live rounds and used only "minimum force", even as 89 officers were wounded, some of them critically.By Thursday morning, phone lines had been restored before internet services returned.Bridges connecting Khartoum with its neighbouring cities reopened and traffic returned to many of the capital's streets.UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Association Clement Voule said he had "received alarming reports of increased use of lethal force by the military against peaceful protesters".He called on the international community to "put pressure on Sudan to immediately stop the repression against civilians and respect their rights"."We condemn violence towards peaceful protesters and call for the respect and protection of human rights in Sudan," the US State Department's Bureau of African Affairs said on Twitter.Call for 'peaceful protests' Last week, Burhan formed a new Sovereign Council, the highest transitional authority, with himself as chief and military figures and ex-rebel leaders keeping their posts.He replaced members from the Forces for Freedom and Change, Sudan's main civilian bloc, with little-known figures.The FFC is an umbrella alliance that spearheaded the protests which led to the ouster of Bashir in 2019, and its mainstream faction has supported the anti-coup protests of recent weeks.Sudan's largest political faction, the Umma Party, condemned the use of force by the security forces and called for peaceful protests to continue "until the coup is brought down" and those who have committed crimes against the people have been held accountable.Since the coup, Burhan has removed clauses referring to the FFC from the 2019 power-sharing deal between the military and the civilians from the bloc.This week, US Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Molly Phee met with the generals and the ousted civilian government in a bid to broker a way out of the crisis.Phee has called for the reinstatement of ousted Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, who is effectively under house arrest.Burhan has vowed to hold the planned elections in 2023, reiterating to Phee on Tuesday that his actions aimed to "correct the trajectory of the revolution".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-clashes-rock-sudan-but-internet-returns-after-deadly-day-report-101637264484710.html

The Bangladeshi citizens did not like the act and also felt it was a political gesture ahead of the golden jubilee celebrations of Bangladesh's independence.The Pakistani cricket team is currently in Bangladesh where it is scheduled to play three T20 matches and two test matches. Bangladesh is celebrating 50 years of its independence. The southeast Asian nation, a close neighbour of India, freed itself from the rule of Pakistan after a hard-fought battle with help from the Indian Army in 1971.According to people familiar with the development, Bangladesh minister Dr Murad Hasan was unimpressed by the incident. Hasan also said that the team be sent back with the flag. “Pakistan cricketers hoisted their national flag during practice. This is not acceptable under any circumstances. I can't support it in any manner,” Hasan said.During any sporting event, it is common practice to hoist the national flags of the participating countries before a fixture but hoisting it during the practice match by the Pakistan national team stirred controversy.“Father of the nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's daughter and prime minister Sheikh Hasina took Bangladesh cricket to new heights through various initiatives. Pakistan team’s practice of hoisting the national flag in Dhaka is a great blow to our national spirit at a time when Bangladesh is celebrating the golden jubilee of its independence from Pakistan and Mujib Borsho marking birth centenary of Bangabandhu,” Hasan further added.Civil society body Nirmul Committee, which was formed to track down and put killers and collaborators of Pakistan during the 1971 war, also condemned the move and said it was ‘intentionally’ disrespectful towards Bangladesh as it celebrates the golden jubilee of its independence.Pakistan Cricket Board, however, went into damage control mode saying that coach Saqlain Mushtaq began this practice two months earlier. “ Saqlain Mushtaq launched the practice to boost the team's morale,” visiting team manager Ibrahim Badizi told news agency BBC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-in-damage-control-mode-after-bangladesh-reacts-strongly-to-hoisting-of-flag-101637244363678.html
19-11-2021||India||Bengal governor seeks records of assembly proceedings against new BSF law, probe agencies||West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar has written a letter to assembly speaker Biman Banerjee, seeking details of the breach of privilege motion moved on Wednesday against two senior officers of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the resolution passed on Tuesday against the Centre’s decision to extend the jurisdiction of the Border Security Force (BSF) from 15 to 50 km of the international border in the state. “Attention of the Honourable Speaker be drawn also to the fact that on earlier occasions too proceedings were sought but unfortunately the same are not being made available,” Dhankhar wrote to Banerjee on Thursday and tweeted a copy of the letter on Friday. He gave the speaker a week to act. The speaker told the media that he will respond in accordance with parliamentary rules. Trinamool Congress (TMC) secretary general and minister of parliamentary affairs Partha Chatterjee, however, saw this as interference in the assembly’s affairs by Raj Bhawan. “This is not the first time that efforts have been made to interfere in the functioning of the state assembly,” said Chatterjee. On Wednesday, the assembly passed a motion against two senior officers of the CBI and ED, accusing them of breaching the privilege of the House by not seeking the speaker’s consent before filing a charge-sheet and arresting three TMC legislators in the Narada sting operation case in May. The privilege motion, moved by Tapas Roy, TMC’s deputy chief whip in the assembly, was passed by the House and forwarded to the committee of privileges for further proceedings. The officers - CBI deputy superintendent of police Satyendra Singh and ED assistant director Rathin Biswas - were summoned by Biman Banerjee in September but the central agencies moved the Calcutta high court seeking relief from appearance before the speaker. The ED sent a letter to the speaker saying it did not need his sanction. The CBI wrote to him that sanction for prosecution against the TMC legislators was given by the governor. The CBI filed a charge-sheet against ministers Subrata Mukherjee and Firhad Hakim and legislator Madan Mitra in the 2014 Narada case and arrested them along with former TMC legislator Sovon Chatterjee on May 17. The ED submitted the charge-sheet against them on September 1. Mukheree, the most senior among the accused, died in Kolkata on November 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-governor-seeks-records-of-assembly-proceedings-against-new-bsf-law-probe-agencies-101637343851119.html

I congratulate farmers for their will power to fight, sacrifice and defeat the mighty state power and their crony capitalist friends," Ali tweeted.Prime Minister Modi must also reconsider and repeal CAA "without further delay", he added.Jamiat president Maulana Arshad Madani welcomed the announcement of withdrawal of the three farm laws and lauded the farmers for their "success".Every effort was made to subdue the farmers' movement just as it was done with all other agitations in the country, Madani alleged.Conspiracies were hatched to divide the farmers, but they continued to make all kinds of sacrifices and remained steadfast in their stand, he said in a statement released by the Jamiat faction led by him.Madani claimed that the agitation against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act encouraged farmers to protest the farm laws.Madani also demanded that just like the agri laws, the CAA should be withdrawn.He said that the decision to withdraw the farm laws has shown that democracy and the power of the people is paramount.The CAA was notified on December 12, 2019 and came into force with effect from January 10, 2020.After the CAA was passed by Parliament, widespread protests were witnessed in different parts of the country.The CAA is aimed at granting Indian citizenship to persecuted minorities like Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, Parsis and Christians from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jamiat-ulema-e-hind-demands-repeal-of-caa-101637341164817.html

Moitra released a document issued by the regional deputy director of Geology and Mining which approves the ‘mining plan’ based on an application filed by Pramod Sawant for his stone quarry in Dodamarg, a village in Maharashtra that lies along the Goa-Maharashtra border. “The letter clearly shows that Pramod Sawant, as the CM of Goa, got a mine in his name in Sindhudurg district in Maharashtra. But the big question is, where did he get the money to lease a mine if he was an Ayurvedic doctor with the government? The Central Bureau of Investigation and Enforcement Directorate should probe as to how a sitting Chief Minister can afford to (lease) a mine in Sindhudurg. His disproportionate assets should be checked,” Moitra said. The Chief Minister’s Office, when asked to respond to the allegations, said that Sawant had already clarified the issue ‘two years ago’ and that no fresh statement would be issued. In 2019, the Congress had accused Sawant of acquiring properties in neighbouring Dodamarg disproportionate to his known sources of income. Responding back then, Sawant said he had “nothing to hide”. “There is nothing to hide. The money was paid from my bank account and the land is in my name. If I wanted to do something on the sly would I have registered the land in my own name?” Sawant had said in November 2019.The Congress alleged that Sawant in his affidavit filed before the Goa Assembly elections had declared possession of 2966 acres of land in Dodamarg which he said was valued at ₹38 lakh. Sawant, however, responded saying that the Congress had missed to notice the decimal point in his affidavit and the actual size of the land was 2.966 acres of land.However, subsequently two more sale deeds have come to light -- one land measuring 4.39 acres cost him ₹14 lakh and another measuring 0.79 acres cost him ₹36 lakh.Back then it wasn’t clear what the land was purchased for, however, the recent revelations by the TMC suggest that the land was purchased for setting up a stone quarry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mahua-moitra-accuses-goa-cm-of-holding-disproportionate-assets-questions-funds-for-quarry-101637341390833.html
19-11-2021||India||Rahul Gandhi's open letter to farmers: A promise for support in future struggles||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has written an open letter to the farmers, in which the former president of the grand old party has congratulated the protestors on their “historic victory” and assured Congress' support in future struggles. His words come in light of the fact that the central government had earlier in the day decided to repeal the three contentious agriculture laws that prompted yearlong protests from tens of thousands of farmers and posed a significant political challenge to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration.In his open letter to the farmers on this occasion, Congress' Rahul Gandhi declared that the struggle is not over yet. He also asked Modi not to dare again “conspire to make farmers slaves in their own land by playing into the hands of a few capitalists”. Moreover, Gandhi reminded the premiere of his promise of doubling farmers' income by 2022 and urged him to work towards fulfilling the same.“For this, they should also release a roadmap of future plans as soon as possible,” wrote Gandhi in the open letter that was issued in Hindi. “Prime minister, do not forget that power is a medium of service and there is no place in any democracy for plunder, stubbornness, and arrogance.”Rahul Gandhi referred to the farmers' struggle as a ‘satyagraha’ (a form of nonviolent political resistance, most demonstrably used by Mahatma Gandhi), and said that the farmers have won despite the freezing cold, the scorching heat, the rains, and all troubles and atrocities inflicted upon them over almost the entirety of the past year. It is unparalleled in the history of independent India, the letter noted.The Congress MP also said the Gandhian manner in which the farmers fought against “the arrogance of an autocratic ruler and forced him to withdraw his decision is a perfect example of the triumph of truth over falsehood.”“I bow down to the sacrifices made by more than 700 farmers and labourers in this struggle,” wrote Rahul Gandhi.In his address to the nation earlier this day, the Prime Minister said, “We have decided to repeal all three farm laws, will begin the procedure at the Parliament session that begins this month. I urge farmers to return home to their families and let us start afresh.”Farmers have been protesting against the three farm laws since they were passed by the Centre in 2020.The three farm laws are – The Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act provides for setting up a mechanism allowing the farmers to sell their farm produces outside the Agriculture Produce Market Committees (APMCs). Any license-holder trader can buy the produce from the farmers at mutually agreed prices. This trade of farm produces will be free of mandi tax imposed by the state governments.The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act allows farmers to do contract farming and market their produces freely.The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act is an amendment to the existing Essential Commodities Act. (With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-s-open-letter-to-farmers-a-promise-for-support-in-future-struggles-101637339658490.html

19-11-2021||India||India-China ties are going through a bad patch: Jaishankar at Bloomberg New Economic Forum||India-China relations are currently passing through a “particularly bad patch” and India’s interests are better served with a closer relationship with the US and Europe, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said on Friday. In a reference to the standoff in the Ladakh sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC), Jaishankar said the downturn in ties was due to China’s actions that had violated bilateral pacts, and that he had conveyed to his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi during recent meetings where New Delhi stands on the relationship with Beijing. “We are going through a particularly bad patch in our relationship because they have taken a set of actions in violation of agreements for which they still don’t have a credible explanation and that appears to indicate some rethink about where they want to take our relationship, but that’s for them to answer,” he said at a panel discussion on the theme “Greater power competition: The emerging world order” at the Bloomberg New Economic Forum in Singapore. “I don’t think the Chinese have any doubt on where we stand on our relationship and what’s not gone right with it. I’ve been meeting my counterpart Wang Yi a number of times. As you would’ve experienced, I speak fairly clear, reasonably understandably [and] there is no lack of clarity. So if they want to hear it, I am sure they would have heard it,” Jaishankar said in his reply to a question on whether China was aware of how it had mishandled relations with India. Jaishankar has said in the past that China had offered no credible explanation for the massing of troops on the LAC and the standoff that began in May last year. India has blamed China’s unilateral efforts to change the status quo on the disputed border for the face-off, which resulted in the first fatalities on the LAC since 1975. Twenty Indian soldiers and at least four Chinese troops were killed in a brutal clash in Galwan Valley in June last year. Though the two sides pulled back frontline troops at Pangong Lake and Gogra after several rounds of talks, there has been no headway in disengagement at other friction points since August. India has also linked the normalisation of overall ties with China to the resolution of the standoff. In response to another question at the discussion, which was also joined by former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton and former UK prime minister Tony Blair, Jaishankar said India’s interests are better served “with a much closer relationship with the US, with a much stronger relationship with Europe and the UK, with a...re-energising of our relationship with Asean, especially Singapore”. “I think there’s no question the US has been strategically contracting for some time. Don’t confuse it with the decline of the US, I think that’s ridiculous. But relatively and absolutely, American power or American influence is not what it used to be,” he said. The US is now a “much more flexible partner, much more open to ideas, suggestions, and working arrangements than in the past”, and this reflects a changed world, he pointed out. At the same time, China has been expanding, though the nature of its growing influence is very different from that of the US. “We don’t have a situation where China necessarily replaces the US,” he said. The world is more multipolar now and a lot of countries, including India, have “come much more into play” as part of a rebalancing of power, Jaishankar said. The overall landscape has become “more volatile”, and the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad is a good example of countries coming together on a set of concerns or issues, he added. Jaishankar acknowledged that some of the positioning by India is “about China”, and the steps being taken by the country are “partly a hedging strategy” and “partly autonomous partnerships” that are issue-based. The Covid-19 pandemic had accelerated this trend because it had raised questions about the old style of globalisation and highlighted the need for more reliable and resilient supply chains, he said. In this context, he pointed to the Quad initiative to produce and distribute US-developed Covid-19 vaccine made in India with Japan’s financial assistance and Australia’s logistics support. This initiative reflects decentralised globalisation, more resilient supply chains, more trust and transparency, and more flexible combinations producing solutions for a particular challenge, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indiachina-ties-are-going-through-a-bad-patch-jaishankar-at-bloomberg-new-economic-forum-101637337370529.html

His family members said he passed away due to a heart attack at a private hospital in Ernakulam. He is survived by his wife and two daughters. HT had profiled him last month before his last trip to Russia. He passed away without fulfilling his wish-- a desire to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “I would like to meet Prime Minister Modi once. He has a humble origin and started his life as a tea vendor like me. I admire him a lot,” he had said. The couple became famous for their globetrotting adventures funded by the meagre income they earned by running a tea shop in Kochi’s Kadavanthara. Many celebrities like industrialist Anand Mahindra, actors Amitabh Bachchan, Anupam Kher and writer-politician Shashi Tharoor had lauded the couple. The couple’s trip to Russia (October 21-28) made headlines as they set out for yet another journey after a break of two years due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Kerala tourism minister PA Mohammad Riyas had also called on them before their Russia trip. The Kongani couple’s first trip was to Israel in 2007 and they visited 26 countries after this. Running a tea shop for 40 years, the travel bug bit the couple after getting their two daughters married. Several times they took loans to foot their travel bills. “It is often said experience is the best teacher. Travel is the best experience that makes you richer,” the couple had said before their visit to Russia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/globetrotting-tea-seller-from-kerala-who-visited-26-countries-dies-101637334130258.html
19-11-2021||India||Mehul Choksi moves Bombay HC, says he is unable to travel; not refusing to travel||Fugitive India-born businessman Mehul Choksi has moved the Bombay high court urging the court to put the proceeding of declaring him as a ‘fugitive’ economic offender as he is unable to travel at the moment, Bar and Bench reported. The proceeding has been initiated by the Enforcement Directorate before a Mumbai court.In his application, moved by advocates Vijay Aggarwal and Ayush Jindal, Choksi said that he had been permitted to be treated in Antigua and Barbuda and once he is certified to be fit and capable for travel, he would be required to return to Dominica to face the charges against him. So, it can't be said that Choksi is refusing to return to India to face criminal prosecution and that he is a fugitive. Choksi also argued that he left India much before the registration of any FIR against him in connection with the multi-crore PNB scam. Because of his medical condition, he is not being able to travel to India, which can not be seen as he is refusing to return to India to face criminal prosecution, he said.Choksi's lawyers argued that when the Dominica court had passed the order, Indian authorities were present and so it will be unfair for them to argue that Choksi is refusing to return to India.Early this year, Mehul Choksi's mysterious disappearance from Antigua and Barbuda created a storm as India was hoping to extradite the fugitive businessman. He was caught by Dominican police and was allowed to travel to Antigua and Barbuda only on medical grounds. Dominica did not have the facilities required to provide Choksi adequate medical care, the Dominican court said. Choksi will also have to face legal proceedings in Dominica for illegal entry into the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mehul-choksi-moves-bombay-hc-says-he-is-unable-to-travel-not-refusing-to-travel-101637330035970.html
19-11-2021||India||MSP law bigger battle for farmers, govt, say analysts||Farm unions on Friday welcomed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to roll back three agricultural laws they had been opposing for year, but the government now has to contend with a tougher demand – a law guaranteeing minimum support prices or MSP to cultivators for their produce. The reforms Modi said his government would rescind aimed to allow businesses to freely trade farm produce outside regulated markets, called mandis, permit private traders to stockpile large quantities of essential commodities for future sales and lay down a national framework for contract farming. Farmers feared the new economic agenda could pave the way for the government to stop buying staples at federally fixed minimum support prices (MSP) and would leave them at the mercy of private buyers. The government has insisted it will still buy staples at MSP, but farmers have demanded a law that prohibits purchase of major farm produce below state-set minimum prices. MSPs, which began with the Green Revolution, are set such that they offer 50% returns over cost but mainly benefit paddy and wheat growers because the government procures only these two commodities in sufficiently large quantities. Indian farmers receive lower-than-international prices for much of their produce because of increasing costs of cultivation, inadequate markets and the government’s policy to keep food prices low. This has worsened agriculture’s terms of trade, measured as a ratio of prices of agri-products to prices of manufactured items. The crisis, therefore, is not one of low production, but of low prices. An MSP is an important policy tool that helped achieve food self-sufficiency because it gave farmers assured prices. It is an important price signal. It is an administrative exercise that does not have statutory backing. While the government announces MSP for 23 major crops, setting them at 1.5 times the cost of cultivation to account for inflation, analysts say a blanket law mandating that no trader can buy any farm commodity below this threshold price could be tough to implement. “The demand for a law on MSP will elicit a bigger response from farmers now because it be a direct step towards higher income. It involves huge central expenditure and this will be a bigger problem for the Modi government,” said Sudhir Panwar, a professor of Lucknow University. The most immediate impact of such a law will be higher food inflation. Higher MSPs prima facie leads to higher overall prices. Every 1 percentage point increase in MSPs leads to a 15-basis point increase in inflation, according to Nomura economist Sonal Varma. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Economists say an MSP mechanism that ignores dynamics, such as demand and global prices, creates distortions. If it is not profitable for private traders to buy at federally-fixed MSP, when demand is low, then the private sector will simply exit the markets. In such a scenario, the government simply cannot be a monopoly buyer of all produce. The government already procures staggering quantities of surplus rice and wheat, which have become unmanageable. The government on average holds at least 70 million tonnes of rice and wheat in federal stocks, whereas food-security norms require reserves of 41.1 million tonnes as of July and 30.7 million tonnes as of October each year. If MSP is made mandatory, then India’s agricultural exports could become non-competitive because the government’s assured prices are way higher than both domestic and international market prices. No trader would want to buy at a higher price and export at a lower rate. So, the assumption behind the new changes is that free competition in agricultural markets will ultimately result in a market-clearing price, at which quantity supplied equals quantity demanded, resulting in an equilibrium. According to economist Ashok Gulati, the cost of procuring, storing and distributing rice to the poor comes to about ₹37 a kg. For wheat, it is around ₹27 a kg. The cost to company (CTC) of labour of the Food Corporation of India (FCI) is six to eight times higher than private labour. Therefore, market prices of rice and wheat are much lower than what it costs the FCI to buy them. On the other hand, the MSP policy benefits farmers only in a handful of states. The 70th round of National Sample Survey showed only 13.5% of paddy growers and 16.2% of wheat growers actually received MSPs. While MSPs have incentivised foodgrains over other crops, they have given rise to serious imbalances of water and land resources and shifted land away from crops, such as pulses and oilseeds, necessitating costly imports. Also, MSPs, as administered prices, tend to distort market prices. They often ignore the demand side, international prices, export competitiveness and ecological impacts of crops such as paddy. This also means surplus stocks can’t be exported without a subsidy, which invites World Trade Organisation’s objections. WTO rules cap government procurement for subsidized food programmes by developing countries at 10% of the total value of agricultural production based on 1986-88 prices in dollar terms. “Support to farmers can never be in question. But support in the form of MSP, which is market-distorting, raises questions, such as ‘whether can we move to other ways of supporting farmers that cause less collateral damage,” said Pravesh Sharma, a fellow at New Delhi’s Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/msp-law-bigger-battle-for-farmers-govt-say-analysts-101637329809715.html

The Railway Board in a letter asked the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) to resume serving cooked meals to passengers on trains to restore normal train services as the pandemic-infused lockdown restrictions eased."In view of the restoration of normal train services, requirements of travelling passengers and easing of Covid lockdown restrictions in eateries, restaurants, hotels and such other places across the country, it has been decided by the Ministry of Railways to resume the services of cooked food in trains," the letter stated.At the same time, ready-to-eat meals will continue to be served to passengers, the Railway board noted.Earlier this month, the Railways rolled back all the regular mail timetables for the running of normal trains, withdrawing the ‘special train’ tag which had been in place for the pandemic. The Railways also decided to revert to the original fares for train tickets as applicable.The decision comes at a time when India's coronavirus cases have remained steady at around 10,000-15,000 daily infections over the past few days.Recently, the Ministry of Civil Aviation had allowed all airlines to serve cooked meals on domestic flights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/railways-to-resume-serving-cooked-meals-on-trains-101637328349652.html

The arrests were made from Ahmedabad and Pune, the agency said, adding that while one is RBL’s regional head, Agro division, in Ahmedabad, the other is its recovery head in Pune.In a statement, the CBI noted that the action was taken after a case was registered against the two accused on a complaint filed against them on allegations of demanding ₹1 crore in bribe for issuing a Valuation Certificate. “The complainant, along with 12 of his family members, applied for an agricultural term loan under the Development of Commercial Horticulture through National Horticulture Board’s Post Harvest Management of Horticulture Scheme. Under this, the government gives a total subsidy of 50 per cent of the total project cost, limited to ₹56 lakh per project,” the statement further said.Giving more details, the CBI also said that the Agri term loans of the complainant and his family became non-performing assets (NPA) due to the non-availability of the subsidy. Therefore, to avail a subsidy, a Value Certificate for mortgaged properties was required, it said.The federal agency alleged that following negotiations, the bribe was settled at ₹30 lakh. To arrest the accused, raids were carried out in five cities, including Ahmedabad, Delhi and Pune, at the office and residential premises of the duo.After a ‘trap’ was laid, the accused were caught, and will be produced in a court, the CBI said, adding that further investigation into the case was underway.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-arrests-2-ratnakar-bank-officials-for-accepting-bribe-of-rs-30-lakh-101637328817857.html

In the video, Rahul Gandhi can be seen sayin, "I am very very proud of what the farmers are doing and I fully support the farmers. I will continue to stand with them. I raised their issue in a yatra in Punjab and we will continue to do it. Mark my words, take it from me.. these laws..the government will be forced to take them back. Remember what I said.

The announcement comes in the wake of the Narendra Modi-led government at the Centre deciding to repeal the three contentious agricultural laws passed earlier last year, after prompted yearlong protests from tens of thousands of farmers and posed a significant political challenge to the Modi government.In an official statement, Congress celebrated the repeal of the farm laws and asked its local state units to organise Kisan Vijay rallies and related political programmes across the country tomorrow. All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary (organisation) KC Venugopal directed all state units to organise such rallies and candle marches at the state, district, and block levels on Saturday.In a letter to the party's state unit chiefs, Venugopal said the repeal of the three “draconian” farm laws is a victory of the farmers and a result of farmers' protests, their sacrifices and the year-long uncompromising fight of a united opposition led by the Congress party and Rahul Gandhi.Congress leaders will also visit the families of the more than 700 farmers who died during the agitation and will organise candle marches and rallies to pray for the departed souls. “Let us extensively organise programmes to join the nation in observing this as a historic victory of the farmers,” Venugopal said. “Mark the victory of the farmers' struggle by visiting families of shaheed farmers in our areas.”“This collective victory over evil is humbly dedicated to all the annadatas of our country,” he added.In his address to the nation earlier this day, the Prime Minister said, “We have decided to repeal all three farm laws, will begin the procedure at the Parliament session that begins this month. I urge farmers to return home to their families and let us start afresh.”Farmers have been protesting against the three farm laws since they were passed by the Centre in 2020.The three farm laws are – The Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act provides for setting up a mechanism allowing the farmers to sell their farm produces outside the Agriculture Produce Market Committees (APMCs). Any licence-holder trader can buy the produce from the farmers at mutually agreed prices. This trade of farm produces will be free of mandi tax imposed by the state governments.The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act allows farmers to do contract farming and market their produces freely.The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act is an amendment to the existing Essential Commodities Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-to-celebrate-repeal-of-farm-laws-plans-kisan-vijay-diwas-rallies-for-tomorrow-101637323891879.html

"It is a victory of the farmers and also of my wife because I know the amount of effort she has made. She has worked day and night for the farmers," Robart Vadra said to ANI.On his part, Vadra has been sending food to the farmers since November last year, the time from when the farmers from Punjab, Uttar Pradesh have been protesting on Delhi borders. "They have been on the streets. Wherever I have driven, farmers came running to my car with a hope that somebody can hear them and hear their woes," Vadra said.Hoping that the announcement gets implemented, Vadra said, "I know Priyanka and Rahul stood by farmers and Congress stood by them and it is their victory. Tikait ji asked farmers not to move because they do not believe the government."In an unpredicted move, PM Modi on Friday announced that the government will repeal the three laws which were brought with the best intentions but the government failed to convince a section of farmers, he said.Welcoming the decision, Priyanka Gandhi said the decision is prompted by the party's fear of defeat in the upcoming polls. "Six hundred farmers martyred, more than 350 days of struggle, Narendra Modi ji your minister's son crushed the farmers to death, you didn't care. Your party leaders insulted the farmers and called them terrorists, traitors, goons, miscreants, you yourself called them 'andolanjeevi', beat them with sticks, arrested them," Priyanka said."The BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's arrogance had to bow before the farmers but the country will not forget your sin. People have now understood that the victory of Indians and India lies ahead of BJP's defeat," the Congress said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sending-food-to-farmers-since-nov-robert-vadra-says-farm-law-repeal-priyanka-s-victory-too-101637321883982.html
19-11-2021||India||Govt will have to introduce bill to repeal three agri laws: Experts||The government will have to move a bill in Parliament to repeal the three agri laws, which were at the centre of protests by farmers for the past year, Constitution and legal experts said on Friday.       In his address to the nation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that the three agri laws will be repealed and the constitutional process required to do so will be completed in the Winter session of Parliament beginning later this month. "For repeal, the power of Parliament is the same as enacting a law under the Constitution," explained former Union Law Secretary P K Malhotra. "The government will have to bring a bill to repeal the three laws. There is no other way," said former Lok Sabha Secretary General P D T Acharya.  Responding to a query, Acharya said the government can repeal the three laws through a single repealing bill.In the statement of objects and reason of the bill, the government can mention the reasons why it intends to repeal the three laws, he said."When a repeal bill is passed, it is also a law," observed Malhotra.The three agri laws have not been implemented, but the fact remains that they are laws passed by Parliament which have received assent of the President, said Malhotra, noting that they can be repealed by Parliament alone.Addressing the nation, Modi insisted that the laws were in the benefit of farmers and then apologised to people of the country while adding that the government could not convince a section of farmers despite its clear heart and clean conscience.        "I have come to tell you that we have decided to repeal the three farm laws. In the upcoming Parliament session starting at the end of this month, we will complete the constitutional process to repeal the three farm laws," Modi said.In August, 2015, the government had allowed the controversial land acquisition ordinance to lapse amid protests by opposition parties.In his August 30, 2015 'Mann ki Baat' monthly radio address, Prime Minister Modi had announced that the government will not repromulgate the controversial ordinance on land acquisition which was expiring the next day (Monday, August 31)."We had promulgated an ordinance on land acquisition bill which will expire tomorrow. I have decided that it should be allowed to expire. It means restoration of the situation that prevailed before my government took over," the prime minister had said.Apparently referring to the political opponents, he had said lot of doubts have been created over the land bill and fear instilled among farmers even though states had suggested amendments to the act of 2013 for the benefit of villages and villagers.The Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act are the three laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-will-have-to-introduce-bill-to-repeal-three-agri-laws-experts-101637321330832.html
19-11-2021||India||‘Fear of electoral defeat forced Modi to repeal farm laws’: Chidambaram||Former Union minister P Chidambaram on Friday said fear of electoral defeat forced Prime Minister Narendra Modi to retreat and announce the repeal of the three farm laws that were enacted last year and triggered protracted farmer protests. “This government does not fear democracy or Parliament. It only fears a loss in elections. If you want this government to mend its ways, the best thing the people of India can do is to defeat it in every election,” he said at a press conference in poll-bound Goa. He added the government will not mend its ways and is run by a dictatorial approach. “The only way we can solve these problems is to defeat them. Once you defeat them, they will behave for five years. Otherwise, they will get more arrogant, more determined, more haughty and more undemocratic.”Chidambaram said three weeks ago, Modi said in Uttar Pradesh that anybody, who opposes the farm laws is anti-national, and that they will never withdraw them. “What has happened today? What has happened is they have feedback that they will lose very badly in the next round of elections in five states including Goa. It is the fear of losing elections which has impelled the PM to suddenly announce at 9 am this (Friday) morning that he has decided to withdraw the farm laws.”He added the government does not believe in consultation. “It does not believe in discussion, parliamentary debate. The last parliament session was washed out because the government refused to debate the farm laws, and price rise. That kind of a stubborn government has today announced the withdrawal of farm laws means that they are losing the next round of elections. This is a lesson for the people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fear-of-electoral-defeat-forced-modi-to-repeal-farm-laws-chidambaram-101637321409574.html

NFSSM traces key policies implemented by states||The National Faecal Sludge and Septage Management (NFSSM) Alliance, an umbrella body of organisations that are engaged with faecal sludge and septage management in India, on Friday today launched ‘India for the World’ – a platform tracking the key work being done for safe and sustainable sanitation practices in the country. In an official release, the NFSSM Alliance said that the ‘India for the World’ web platform provides an “orientation” to the background of the waste management sector, highlighting the progress so far and future directions aimed at the city, state, and national levels.Comprehensive infographics on the platform showcase the “best practices, case studies, and step-by-step implementation milestones and sanitation outcomes” for the entire country, as well as specifically for a few key states – Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Odisha.The infographic also showcases the steps taken by the aforementioned state governments to build cost-effective and inclusive urban sanitation programs – recognising sanitation as a crucial part of urban development and sustainability.Sakshi Gudwani, a senior programme officer at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and also a member of the NFSSM Alliance, said, “India has made tremendous progress in improving access to toilets and is prioritising the treatment of human faecal waste – many states and cities have implemented innovative and scalable solutions for FSM and inclusive sanitation service delivery.”“It is imperative that the learnings from this progress are well-documented and disseminated to other states and cities within the country to replicate and for the world to learn from the great work that is happening in India,” she said while speaking of the ‘India for the World’ web platform. “It (the infographic) shares learnings on implementing effective FSSM and inclusive sanitation service delivery solutions.”Hosted on the NFSSM Alliance official website, the ‘India for the World’ series of infographics depict replicable and scalable models of faecal waste management by various cities and states across the country. According to an official release, these models speak of innovations in areas such as improving operations efficiency by building capacities of sanitation workers as entrepreneurs, exploring diverse sources of finance to move towards operational sustainability, and using technology to eliminate the need for direct human contact with faecal waste – among many others.According to estimates provided by the sanitation body, about 60 per cent of our urban population today depend on onsite sanitation systems, which require dedicated planning for faecal waste management – prioritising human excreta management, a waste stream with a high potential for spreading diseases.The planning strategies entail emptying, transportation, treatment, and safe disposal of waste and possible reuse of output products post-treatment. The web platform covers several multi-professional and low-cost sanitation programs which are implemented according to physical and socio-economic conditions ensuring proper service to everyone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-does-india-manage-its-faecal-waste-nfssm-traces-key-policies-implemented-by-states-101637318521560.html

He claimed that the NCB officer violated central civil services (conduct) rules 1964 by conducting business despite being in service.Wankhede is holding a hotel liquor license since 1997-98 and is running a bar in Navi Mumbai. He said that the license was issued when he was a minor back in 1997-98, which again was illegal. It was issued when his father, Dnyandev Wankhede, was in the state excise department service. The information was concealed while joining the central government services. Only in 2017, Wankhede declared that he owns the inherited property along with his father, which is a hotel but is on a lease, alleged Malik.Wankhede, however, said he had furnished details of his properties to his department and nothing was concealed.Malik also shared documents to corroborate the claims which comprise a report from the state excise department that states that a license to serve liquor in a hotel was issued in the name of Sameer Dnyandev Wankhede on October 29, 1997. The documents further show that the license was renewed every year till February 3, 2021.At the time when the hotel liquor license was issued, Wankhede was a minor and his age was 17 years and 10 months, said Malik.The NCP leader said he will file a complaint with the department of personnel and training (DoPT), the state excise department and with all the concerned departments saying that Sameer Wankhede has no right to stay in the central government services.“It is a clear case of forgery, despite him being a minor, a hotel liquor license was issued in Sameer Wankhde’s name. For the last 24 years, the business has been operated on that license in the name of Sameer Dnyandev Wankhede. The information was concealed while joining the central government services and afterwards because no central government officer can conduct a business while being in services according to the central civil services (conduct) rules 1964,” Malik stated.“He is running a bar but again in 2017, he shared false information with the central government that the hotel property, which he owns along with his father, is on lease. I have also given one of my properties on lease to a hotel operator and all the licenses required for operation are in the name of the operator. I can provide the land on lease, but the license for conducting business will have to be obtained only by the operator,” Malik said adding, “I believe facts are being suppressed in this case as well. He has no right to remain in service. We will follow this up so that Wankhede can be punished.”“We have nothing to conceal. I have furnished all the details with my department, right from the properties I own and income,” Wankhede said in response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wankhede-violated-services-conduct-rules-runs-a-bar-in-navi-mumbai-nawab-malik-101637321049546.html

"Alas, if only there was a way of repealing the Nov 8, 2016, decision by Headlinejeevi. This was really a demon-ic move, for which the country is still paying," the Congress leader said. Alas, if only there was a way of repealing the Nov 8 2016 decision by Headlinejeevi.

"A new class of people has emerged in recent times who can be seen in all agitations and protests. These are andolan jeevis.

They are actually parasites feasting on agitations and protests," PM Modi had said.In an address on Friday, PM Modi said the government will begin the procedure of repealing the farm laws in the Winter Session of Parliament which is likely to commence from November 29. The laws were brought to empower and strengthen small farmers and it was unfortunate that the government could not convince a section of farmers about the benefits of the reforms, PM Modi said.The decision has been hailed as a victory of the protesting farmers and a masterstroke of the BJP ahead of the elections in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab."First, bulldoze laws in Parliament. Then face unprecedented protests. Thereafter, confront election realities in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab, particularly. Finally, after much appeal, repeal. Kisan-ity prevails at last!

19-11-2021||India||Rape survivor denied termination of pregnancy, Orissa HC orders ₹10 lakh compensation||In a case of gang rape, the Orissa High Court slammed a lower court’s order which denied the survivor’s plea to terminate her unwanted pregnancy. The HC observed that this is something bound to severely impact her personality and womanhood.It observed that the lower court, where the victim first approached seeking termination of her undesired pregnancy, should have agreed to her request putting it above the right to life of the unborn child.“Though this issue has, time and again, knocked at the judicial threshold, it is still crying for an unperplexed solution by way of suitable amendment in the statute governing the field,” the single-judge bench of justice SK Panigrahi noted while refusing to allow the medical termination of pregnancy of a 20-year-old gangrape survivor who had approached the court last month after the court of a sub-divisional judicial magistrate in Banki refused to entertain her request on the grounds of lack of jurisdiction. The SDJM also said that the petition could not be considered on its merit as the accused persons were yet to be convicted.In April this year, the girl, from a village of Cuttack district, was gagged by a towel and forcibly taken to a school where the accused raped her and threatened to kill her if she disclosed the matter to her family members or police. After the incident, the victim became pregnant.“The victim is being forced to bear and care for the unwanted child is bound to severely impact her personality and womanhood. Considering the present situation, where the victim chose to approach the court through her guardianas per the MTP Act seeking termination of her undesired pregnancy albeit with some delay, her request should have been acceded to over the life of the unborn child,” the HC said.The HC said the girl and her father initially approached the police station for termination of pregnancy but were directed to approach the concerned court as the charge sheet was filed by then. “The police officers could have acted more sensibly and, at the very least, guided them to approach District Legal Service Authority or Legal Services Units at Taluk Level or to any paralegal volunteers. This would have, perhaps, helped the victim get timely legal advice and may have saved her from suffering the forced delivery which is imposed on her due to medicolegal compulsions,” the HC said, adding that every policeman should be given a proper understanding of the working of legal services authority at different levels.The HC however did not allow termination of pregnancy since the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Act, 2021, which came into force from September 14, the upper limit for medical termination of pregnancy is 24 weeks, from the earlier stipulation of 20 weeks for ‘vulnerable women’ including rape survivors. “There is no other legal option for her but to undergo suffering and deliver the baby since the pregnancy is over twenty-six weeks old. Although this court is painfully conscious of the possible impact of this decision on the life of the victim, it is bound by the legal mandate. The physical, mental, psychological trauma suffered by the petitioner is formidable. Rape is a crime not only against a woman but against humanity at large as it brings out the most brutal, depraved and hideous aspects of human nature. It leaves a scar on the psyche of the victim and an adverse impact on society,” the HC said.Holding that the welfare of the victim is an important consideration, the HC asked the State Legal Services Authority to ensure that the state government pay an amount of ₹10 lakh as compensation to the girl which will be over and above the compensation amount to be awarded by the trial court at the conclusion of the trial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rape-survivor-denied-termination-of-pregnancy-orissa-hc-orders-rs-10-lakh-compensation-101637318409982.html

The cumulative cost of all these government schemes is more than ₹3,250 crore and once fully operating, the projects will help irrigate around 65,000 hectares of land in the districts of Mahoba, Hamirpur, Banda, and Lalitpur, benefitting lakhs of farmers in Uttar Pradesh.Later this evening, Prime Minister Modi will visit the district of Jhansi and lay the foundation stone of a 600-megawatt Ultra Mega Solar Power Park in the Garautha area. The park is being constructed at a cost of over ₹3,000 crore and will help provide cheaper electricity and grid stability, as per the PMO.The Prime Minister is also set to inaugurate the Atal Ekta Park in the Jhansi district. Named after former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the park has been built at a cost of over ₹11 crore, and is spread over an area of about 40,000 square meters. Built by the renowned sculptor Ram Sutar (of the Statue of Unity fame), the park will also house a library and a statue of Vajpayee's.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arjun-sahayak-to-bhaoni-dam-modi-to-launch-irrigation-projects-in-up-s-mahoba-101637314278899.html

Farm laws withdrawal is a deception aimed at the elections. The entire government must resign.”At a press conference, on Friday, at the SP state headquarters in Lucknow, Akhilesh said, “Janata inhe maaf nahin karegi, inhey saaf karegi (people will not forgive those who are apologising, people will oust them)”. He said those who are apologising should also announce quitting politics forever.“Saaf nahin hai inka dil, chunav baad fir layengi bill (their intentions are not clean, they will reintroduce the bills after elections),” said Akhilesh.He said, “Somewhere the government got scared because of the elections. The withdrawal is not for the farmers but aimed at elections. (The enactment of laws) was not a responsibility of one, it was a collective responsibility of the entire cabinet. So not just the cabinet, but the entire government must resign”.Cautioning farmers and people, Akhilesh said, “Sarkar ghabrakar kanoon wapas le rahi hai (the government got scared and withdrew the farm laws). The government might bring the laws back after the elections. So I call upon people to be cautious and alert and in the larger interest of farmers and people, should oust the BJP government”.Yadav congratulated all the farmers in the country. The farmers’ struggle against the three black farm laws led to the withdrawal of the laws, he said.Akhilesh mentioned his Wednesday-Thursday Purvanchal Vijay Yatra as a factor behind the withdrawal of the laws. “I can say that the kind of support Samajwadi Party got in the Purvanchal Vijay Yatra and the way farmers came out on roads to support SP shook not only the UP government but also the union government”.Akhilesh also said that like the three farm laws, the union government’s decision of demonetisation and GST were also wrong and they ruined the economy and traders. “Will the government apologise for the demonetisation?” he asked.“Along with withdrawing the black farm laws, the government should also tell when will it bring in MSP (minimum statutory price) for farm produce procurement and when will the union MoS for home, who is responsible for farmers death (in Lakhimpur Kheri incident) be removed,” Akhilesh said.“The government should also help and give aid to all those farmers who died during the farm agitation. Can BJP bring back those farmers who lost their lives for the farm struggle?” Akhilesh questioned.On PM’s frequent visits to UP, Akhilesh said, “The tours will rise further as the elections get closer”. On the increasing number of visits to the state by senior BJP leaders, he added, “Their tours will increase while elections are getting closer, and after the poll results their stature will be pruned”. On PM’s Mahoba and Jhansi visit on Friday, Akhilesh said, “Today, Mahoba, where the PM is going to speak, is the district where the highest number of farm suicides have happened. Bundelkhand is distressed”.When asked if he had any talks with the farm leader Rakesh Tikait, one of the leaders of the farm agitation, he said, “No. I am myself a farmer”.About the 2022 UP Assembly elections, he said, “Samajwadi Party (and allies) will win more than 400 seats, we are leaving 3 seats for the opposition.” UP has 403 assembly seats.The national vice president of the party, Kiranmoy Nanda, and the leader of opposition in UP Vidhan Sabha, Ramgovind Chaudhary, were also present at the press conference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/deception-aimed-at-elections-akhilesh-yadav-reacts-to-announcement-of-new-farm-laws-repeal-101637314509321.html

They would have benefited farmers. The PM’s intention was to bring revolutionary changes in the lives of farmers," he said.The PM had "tried to bring changes in agriculture through these reforms, but due to some circumstances, some farmers objected," he added."When we took the path of discussions and tried to explain to them, we could not succeed. Hence, on Prakash Parv, the Prime Minister decided to repeal the farm laws. It is a welcome step," he added.He further said the Modi government is committed to the welfare of farmers and the development of the agriculture sector. "A committee will be formed on Zero Budget Farming, Minimum Support Price (MSP), crop diversification issues," the agriculture minister added.The committee will have representatives from the Centre, state governments, farmers, scientists, economists. It will submit a report on making MSP effective and transparent and other issues, Tomar added..The three farm laws that have been repealed are the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act that provides for setting up a mechanism allowing the farmers to sell their farm produce outside the Agriculture Produce Market Committees (APMCs). Any licence-holder trader can buy the produce from the farmers at mutually agreed prices. This trade of farm produce will be free of mandi tax imposed by the state governments.The second law was the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act. It allowed farmers to do contract farming and market their produce freely. The third was the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, an amendment to the existing Essential Commodities Act.The Farmers who have taken to the streets since November last year have said that the laws, if implemented, would leave them at the mercy of the big corporations.

The seizure was made at Mundra port in Gujarat on Thursday by a joint team from Indian customs and Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), according to a statement issued on Friday by Adani Port and Logistics, the operator of the port. There was no official word on the development from the customs or DRI. The statement from Adani Port and Logistics said the joint team of customs and DRI “seized several containers at Mundra Port from a foreign vessel on concerns that they contained undeclared hazardous cargo”. The statement added: “While the cargo was listed as Non-Hazardous, the seized containers had Hazard Class 7 markings (which indicate radioactive substances).” Adani Port and Logistics said the containers “were not destined for Mundra Port or any other port in India” and “were en route from Karachi in Pakistan to Shanghai in China”. The Indian authorities “had them offloaded at Mundra Port for further inspection”, the statement said. Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (APSEZ) “extended all assistance possible for this operation and thanks the Customs & DRI personnel for their quick and coordinated action”, the statement added. APSEZ will “continue to fully assist any action that keeps India safe”, the statement said, adding the Adani Group “takes national security very seriously and will not allow it to be compromised in any way”.

While the Bombay high court will pass an order on November 22 on the plea filed by Sameer Wankhede's father seeking an injunction against minister Nawab Malik, the minister addressed a press conference on Friday and released documents which showed there is a bar and restaurant registered in the name of Sameer Wankhede, operating since 1997.Malik claimed that Sameer Wankhede's father Dnyandev Wankhede who was with the excise department got the licence in Sameer Wankhede's name in 1997. "In 1997, Sameer Wankhede was not even an adult. He was 17 years old and getting a bar licence at that time in illegal," the minister claimed.In a fresh twist, Nawab Malik says Sameer Wankhede framed ex-wife's cousin; HC order on caste case on Nov 22There are three allegations against Wankhede for which he will lose his job, Nawab Malik said. "First allegation is extortion in the case of Aryan Khan. Second is forging a caste certificate for a government job and third is running a bar and concealing the information," the minister said adding that the permit of the bar has been renewed every year and Wankhede has shown the income to the government as rent while a bar, under his name, is functioning on full swing.According to reports, Sameer Wankhede has clarified that he never concealed the information about the bar. Wankhede said he mentions the income from that property in his income tax returns and after he joined the government service, his father has the power of attorney of the property.Nawab Malik said his party will pursue the case and unmask the "illegal" activities the Wankhede family has been doing. In a tweet, Nawab Malik also said he will be travelling to Dubai. "I will be back in India on the 24th of November 2021. Requesting all government agencies to keep an eye on me and track my movement," the minister tweeted.Earlier, Nawab Malik claimed Wankhede had gone to Dubai and extorted money, which Wankhede denied and said he never went to Dubai. It is not yet known whether Nawab Malik's Twitter announcement has something to do with Sameer Wankhede.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sameer-wankhede-owns-a-bar-in-vashi-got-licence-as-a-minor-claims-nawab-malik-101637312948966.html

Besides this, he also demanded martyr status for farmers who died during their protest, adequate monetary compensation and jobs to their family members. Speaking to reporters, Soren termed the decision of the government as ‘unfortunate and laughable’. “The BJP and their supporters are calling the PM a well-wisher of farmers. In other words, it’s like saying that one tries to choke someone’s neck but when the person still survives, you can claim you were just trying to hug the person. Some of their own leaders have spoken about the impending political damage. That is why I say this is an unfortunate and laughable decision,” said Soren, who is also the working president of the ruling Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM). Seeking the resignation of union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar, Soren said the decision (to repeal the farm laws) is backed by realisation in the BJP leadership about the impending political damage. Seeking adequate monetary compensation to those who lost their lives protesting the farm laws, Soren said their family members should also get government jobs.“The decision has established that democracy in the country is still alive. The Prime Minister should immediately provide monetary compensation of ₹5 crore each to the family of all those farmers who died in the protests. They should be given martyr status. All cases filed against protesters should be withdrawn. And other farmers who have been protesting on the street with their family members also need to be compensated with ₹10 lakh each for their crop loss,” added Soren.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jharkhand-cm-demands-agri-minister-s-resignation-rs-5-cr-compensation-to-dead-farmers-101637311329171.html
19-11-2021||India||Education: How the pandemic has left young children vulnerable||New Delhi: The youngest learners in early primary grades require “urgent attention” as schools are reopening, stated the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) for 2021, released on Wednesday, while asserting that their situation should set off “loud alarm bells” even without measuring their learning outcomes.The 16th edition of the report, issued by the non-profit organisation Pratham, was prepared on the basis of a household telephonic survey conducted in rural areas of 581 districts across 25 states and three Union territories between September and October this year.The survey — which covered 76,706 households, 75,234 children between 5 and 16, and teachers and staff from 7,300 government schools — aimed to capture the transition in the education system at a time when schools are reopening in a staggered manner after almost 18 months due to the pandemic.The report highlighted several consequences of Covid-19 pandemic on the Indian education system, including the exodus of rural children from private schools due to financial constraints caused by the pandemic, increasing dependence on paid tuition due to the prolonged closure of schools, and the existing digital divide, among others.It, however, repeatedly emphasised how young children have been affected the most. For instance, the maximum shift from private to public schools was reported among younger students. For classes 1 and 2, the enrollment of boys in government schools rose 10.9% while for girls, the rise was 7.4% between 2020 and 2021. Similarly, more children in higher classes reportedly had access to a smartphone as compared to children in lower grades and it has also been found that the proportion of children currently not enrolled in schools was highest among 5-year-olds — reaching more than 14% in both 2020 and 2021.All these revelations make younger children more “vulnerable”. “The consequences of not designing mechanisms to address the situation of the youngest learners will be extremely grave not only for individual children but for the school system as whole,” the report stated. No classroom experienceThe ASER report 2021 found that one in every three children enrolled in classes 1 and 2 had never attended in-person classes. The percentage of such children is 36.8% in government schools and 33.6% in private schools. As per the survey, overall 35.9 % of children enrolled in classes 1 and 2 have never attended in-person classes. Suman Bhattacharjea, director of the ASER research centre, said, “Given the timeline of the pandemic, the incoming cohort of children in class 1 is unlikely to attend any pre-primary classes before beginning the primary school. Entry to the world of formal education can be a difficult process at the best of times but the challenges these young children face as learners are therefore likely to be far more complex than would have been the case in pre-pandemic times.”The report suggested that teachers now have to pay more attention to such students as the schools are reopening. Some teachers in rural areas also backed the survey observations. Akhilesh Sharma, a primary teacher at a government school in Uttar Pradesh’s Jhansi district, said, “A large number of students in classes 1 and 2 are new and they have no classroom experience. It is very difficult to even make them sit in the class first and basics like writing, reading alphabets and numbers.”Digital divide, decrease in learning supportEven as smartphone ownership doubled between 2018 and 2021, the “youngest learners also have “least access to technology”, ASER 2021 stated. “Almost a third of all children in Classes I and 2 did not have a smartphone available at home.”While the availability of smartphones in rural India was 36.5% in 2018, which increased to 61.8% in 2020 and 67.6% in 2021, only 19.9 % of children in Classes 1 and 2 have access to the devices whenever they require. As many as 39.3% of students in these classes have no access to smartphones, the survey stated. “There is substantial variation in access to smartphones by grade of children. More children in higher classes have access to smartphones compared to lower grades,” it added.Similarly, the report raised grave concerns about the decrease in learning support to these students. Even as the ASER 2021 report found that 91.9% enrolled children have textbooks for their current grade, only about a third of children in classes 1 and 2, whose schools are yet to be reopened, reported to have received learning material from schools, in the form of worksheets in print or virtual form, and online or recorded classes. “Even fewer had had some form of contact with teachers to discuss children’s learning (28.5%). The proportion of families who had some contact with teachers was heavily skewed towards better off families, as proxied by parental education levels,” said Bhattacharjea.High proportion among not-yet-enrolled childrenThe proportion of children currently not in school is driven mainly by the 5 to 8-year old age group. “Among 5-8-year-olds, the proportion of children not currently enrolled in schools is 7.2% which is higher than the corresponding proportion among older children. This year too, the proportion of children not currently enrolled is highest among 5-year-olds, reaching more than 14% in both 2020 and 2021,” the report added.The overall percentage of currently not enrolled children was found to be 4.9%. Bhattacharjea said that getting these children into school is “urgent”. “These data point to a critical task ahead — that of ensuring that young children enrol in school or preschool. It may be that many 5 or 6 years old are simply awaiting admissions, as in the case every year. But this year is not normal. Getting these children into school is urgent. They have already missed many important months of engagements during the critical period of maximum brain development. “Once this period is over, the opportunity to help them build firm foundations during the viral early years will be lost,” he said.Lagging behind While the report doesn’t highlight the impact of pandemic on learning outcomes, a sample survey conducted in the 24 districts of Karnataka covering 20,000 students aged between 5-16-year-olds showed a “steep drop” in children’s foundation skills, particularly among those in lower primary grades. For instance, in class 3rd, only 24.2% students could read at least class 1 level of text. The figure was 41.% in 2018.70.1% of the surveyed teachers also said that the students enrolled in classes 3 to 5 finding it more difficult to catch up with their grade-level curriculum as they return back to offline classes. The way aheadEducationist Meeta Sengupta said that for the younger students, the solution lies in community participation. “We need to urgently invest in community learning with trained para teachers who can guide the little ones based on intense, continuous and mentored support from an online learning system for the teachers. Our little children need a customised hybrid, and this can be done at mass scale, very rapidly, with local community participation to bridge the gap,” she said.Sengupta said that efforts should be made to make learning joyful for younger children when they return to school. “We must revisit the idea of outcomes for the early years and redesign it to meet both the needs of socialisation into learning, and to make learning an act of joy so that they feel good about trying to do better and more,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/education-how-the-pandemic-has-left-young-children-vulnerable-101637311207509.html

In an apparent reference to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the former Uttar Pradesh chief minister demanded that those who have “apologised should also quit politics forever”. PM Modi earlier apologised to the citizens for “failing to explain” farmers the benefits of farm laws.“Farmers's efforts have paid off. It's the defeat of ego and victory of farmers, democracy. People will not forgive them (Centre) in the upcoming polls. This fake apology won't work...People who have apologised should also resign from politics forever,” the SP leader told a press briefing.Akhilesh Yadav urged people to defeat the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the upcoming Assembly polls, saying the government might bring back the legislation once the elections are over. He said that the kind of support his party got from farmers during the Purvanchal Vijay Yatra not only shook the Uttar Pradesh government but also the Union government."The public needs to be cautious, and alert. After the elections, the government might bring the laws back. So for the interest of the farmers, people should vote this government out. Farmers will throw this government out in these elections. They withdrew the laws, not for farmers, but for votes," he added.Govt to scrap agricultural laws, but farm protests to continueThe Samajwadi Party leader also brought up the Lakhimpur Kheri incident where protesting farmers were run over by the car of Union minister Ajay Kumar Mishra’s son. He alleged that the minister is responsible for the death of the farmers, calling on the government to remove him."Along with withdrawing the black farm laws the government should also tell when will the Union minister of state for home affairs will be removed", Akhilesh Yadav said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/akhilesh-yadav-calls-for-bjp-s-defeat-in-polls-says-may-bring-back-farm-laws-later-101637310212209.html
19-11-2021||India||From ordinance to repeal: How HT covered the farm-laws debate||In an early morning address to the nation on the occasion of Guru Nanak Jayanti, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that his government has decided to repeal the three farm laws. Modi’s address, interestingly, has attributed the repeal to the fact that a section of farmers could not “understand” the benefits of these laws. He even apologised to the nation for his government’s failure in conveying the benefits of these farm laws. What does this move mean? HT has covered this issue extensively right from the beginning. A summary of our coverage is the best way to approach this question. There was never any unanimity about the so-called benefits of the farm laws There has never been a consensus on the supposed benefits of the farm laws. HT discussed this question as early as May 18, 2020, almost immediately after the reforms were announced (https://bit.ly/3DwOVhD). The fundamental economic premise of the farm laws being beneficial for all farmers was questionable for two reasons. One, contrary to government claims of farmers being forced to sell their produce to vested interests in Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees (APMCs), which the farm laws abolished, most farmers in India have already been selling their crop to private traders. The latest numbers from the 2018-19 Situation Assessment of Agricultural Households and Land and Livestock Holdings of Households in Rural India (SAS) confirmed this. In a two-part series based on the business of farming in India, HT looked at SAS data to find that only 5.4% of farmers sold their output to APMCs and an overwhelming 77.5% sold their produce in local private markets (https://bit.ly/3Cun7Jh) . SAS also shows that every third farmer is unhappy with the prices he receives for his crop. When read together, these numbers suggest that private traders are not the best when it comes to guaranteeing better prices. The article also highlighted the limitations of contract farming, another key aspect of the farm laws. “Selling to contract farming sponsors or companies directly – this is often offered as a panacea for low farm incomes in the country – does not offer significant improvements in satisfaction of sale. Here, however, the main cause of dissatisfaction is delayed payments”, it said. And two, the deregulation of farm prices through amendment of the essential commodities act, was always susceptible to be suspended when high food prices became a food problem. This part has been confirmed by government actions on crops such as onions and edible oils after the reforms. This was explained in detail in an HT piece on September 23, 2020 (https://bit.ly/3CA0CTc). As the farmers’ protests gained momentum, the rhetoric became more and more anti big-business. HT explained why this was the case on September 19, 2020 (https://bit.ly/3nxQGoU). Input markets in agriculture are already dominated by big business and farmers have seen worsening terms of trade (ratio of prices received to prices paid) mostly on account of input costs in farming. With big business being allowed into output markets, they feared even worse. The move is political, not a change of heart on policy The next assembly election cycle – this includes the state of Punjab and Uttar Pradesh – will take place early next year. Punjab has been the epicentre of the farmers’ protests since day zero. It is here that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) paid the biggest price for the farm laws when the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), one of the oldest constituents of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) decided to break ranks on the issue. It remains to be seen whether the BJP reaches out to the SAD after this decision. Also, whether the SAD-BJP and estranged Congress leader Amrinder Singh form a joint front to fight the elections will be an interesting thing to watch out for. But the farm laws did not seem to be a big political factor elsewhere. For example, the BJP actually managed to increase its vote share in the Ellenabad assembly by-poll in Haryana even though it did not win the election. “While the Haryana elections will only happen in 2024 and the BJP has never had much of a presence in Punjab, a consolidation of non-Jat and non-Muslim votes could minimise, if not completely negate, the BJP’s potential losses in the Uttar Pradesh elections early next year”, this author said in an analysis (https://bit.ly/30GpBap) of the by-poll results on November 3. Even the opposition did not try making the farm laws into an issue (in elections such as in Bihar last year) as was explained in HT on October 30, 2020 (https://bit.ly/3DC6jBu). The farm law attracted protests in only those states, where agriculture is still a relatively high-income activity. This, in turn, is a direct outcome of government procurement. However, there can be no denying the fact that the forthcoming assembly election cycle would have presented the biggest political challenge to the BJP on this issue. Punjab and western Uttar Pradesh, along with Haryana, is what forms the core of Green Revolution belt in India. The BJP’s retreat on the farm laws should be best seen as a decision to avoid a full-scale confrontation with the local elite in the Green Revolution regions, which, to its credit, was able to rally other sections in its protests as well. HT has looked at this issue in detail on September 21, 2020 (https://bit.ly/3xa73vm). By making a retreat on this front, the BJP has clearly indicated that it prefers to be risk averse on the issue than risking its political capital in the most important state of Uttar Pradesh. Western Uttar Pradesh, where the farmers’ protests are the strongest, accounts for more than hundred assembly constituencies in the 403 member assembly. Indeed, the Lakhimpur incident, where the son a BJP union minister for state has been accused of killing protesting farmers, might have increased the potential headwinds to the BJP from farmers’ protests. Status-quo in farming and all of farmers’ demands aren’t desired outcomes either Just as the government’s claims of farm laws being unambiguously beneficial do not stand scrutiny, demands of restoring status-quo-ante or even strengthening it are difficult to justify. For example, a Minimum Support Price (MSP) driven expansion of paddy cultivation in Punjab and Haryana has unleashed widespread environmental destruction on soil quality and water tables in these states and pollution in Delhi and adjoining areas because of stubble burning. HT explained the relation between paddy cultivation and pollution on November 16, 2021 (https://bit.ly/3HzZG58). An HT article published on December 2, 2020 showed that richer farmers inflicted greater environmental damage in Punjab (https://bit.ly/3CxDB3x). Then there is also the question of the dubious practice of agricultural subsidies – they are often driven by demands from farmers -- which has destroyed the financial health of distribution companies as well as state governments. Some of these issues were discussed in an HT piece on October 28, 2021 (https://bit.ly/30B2a24). Each of these challenges needs to be addressed on an urgent basis if India’s long-term growth and sustainability interests are to be preserved. This is not the end of political conflicts on agricultural policy The government’s decision to repeal the farm laws is not going to be the end of political conflict around farm policy in the country. In fact, this is the basic political economy fault line in India. “The main reason for the agrarian crisis is that agriculture employs far too many people to be remunerative. At least 40% of India’s workforce is employed in agriculture, even though it generates less than 15% of the country’s GDP”, HT explained on October 10, 2020 (https://bit.ly/3oClZOS). “The current set of reforms does nothing to address this basic income-employment asymmetry in agriculture”, the article said. An HT piece published on July 29, 2020 underlined another central contradiction in India (https://bit.ly/30CoXuX). “Maintaining terms of trade in favour of agriculture (which is what boosts farmers’ income) and ensuring reasonable food prices for consumers might not be compatible”, while adding that “to really shift the fortunes in favour of agriculture will require a demand driven sustainable policy trajectory”. These are all issues which will continue to matter in Indian politics in the foreseeable future. Will farmers’ movements gain a pan-India boost after this struggle? Not necessarily. The current farmers’ protest was not the first in India. However, not all of them have been as successful as this one. One of the biggest handicaps which prevent genuine farmers’ solidarity in India is the question of caste, which prevents farmers from the Other Backward Classes and upper castes from coming together while the Dalits are largely non-stakeholders in agriculture, HT explained on September 23, 2021 (https://bit.ly/3qVwuj0).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-ordinance-to-repeal-how-ht-covered-the-farm-laws-debate-101637310607544.html

19-11-2021||India||Farmers at UP-Gate welcome PM’s announcement but agitation to continue||Ghaziabad: Farmers camped at the Delhi border at UP Gate since November 26 last year distributed jalebis and termed as a victory Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Friday announcement that the government will repeal three controversial farm laws passed in Parliament in 2020. The farmers have been demanding a roll back of the laws, and a law to guarantee minimum support prices (MSP) for a range of crops.Hundreds of farmers at the UP Gate protest site, mostly from districts in western Uttar Pradesh and parts of Uttarakhand, have been preparing for a march to Delhi on November 29 during the next Parliament session. On Friday, soon after the announcement, more farmers were rushing to the site, according to leaders of the farm unions.“It is indeed a victory of the yearlong agitation by farmers, and about 700 of them also gave their lives to the cause of this agitation. The PM’s announcement has come on the day of “Prakash Utsav” (Guru Nanak’s birthday) and it is a welcome step. Still, we will wait and watch till the laws finally get repealed. Further, a law on MSP should be passed. The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) will roll out further strategy in coming time but for now the protest site will continue to operate,” said Jagtar Singh Bajwa, farmer leader from Uttarakhand and the UP Gate site’s spokesperson for SKM, an umbrella body of several farm unions.“The government is feeling the heat of the continued agitation by the farmers, and the decision has come ahead of assembly elections in several states being round the corner,” Bajwa added. Assembly elections in three key states in the context of the farmers’ movement -- Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand -- are due early next year. The farmers at UP Gate have been occupying portions of the Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageways of National Highway 9 for almost a year, and hundreds of tents have been set up at the site. Rakesh Tikait, national spokesperson of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), and one of the principal leaders of the protesting farmers, indicated that the agitation would not be suspended yet. “The agitation will not be taken back immediately. We will wait for the day when the farm laws are rolled back in the Parliament. The government should talk to farmers on the issues of MSP and others,” he tweeted. There have been multiple rounds of talks between the government and the farm unions, but none since January 22 this year when both sides took hard positions on the question of repealing the laws. Sardar VM Singh, a prominent farmer leader who heads the Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangathan, which moved out of UP Gate protest site in January after a Republic Day tractor march to Delhi turned violent, said that key was a guarantee on MSP. “This agitation, however long it lasts, should have something that goes for the farmers and each farmer must gain. Ordinance came in June 2020 and the crop like wheat, dhan, makka, etc., were then going at the rate of 30-40% less than MSP. Basic thing is that the MSP guarantee must be given. This is the issue we were fighting for and if the guarantee on MSP would have been given, the three laws would have become infructuous automatically,” Singh said. The PM, in his address, said that MSP will be made more robust and transparent, and a committee will be constituted to take decisions on the matters related to the issue. Some farmer leaders at the Ghaziabad site viewed the development as “political compulsion”. “The decision has come ahead of the assembly elections in UP, and it shows that the government is feeling the heat of the sustained efforts by the farmers put in the movement for almost a year. The decision by the PM is welcome step and we will wait to see it turning into reality. Further, there were other demands like law on MSP which should be fulfilled for benefit of farmers,” said Prabal Pratap Singh, spokesperson for BKU (Asli). The umbrella SKM issued a statement soon after the PM’s address. “Samyukta Kisan Morcha welcomes this decision and will wait for the announcement to take effect through due parliamentary procedures. If this happens, it will be a historic victory of the one-year long farmers’ struggle in India. However, nearly 700 farmers have been martyred in this struggle. The central government’s obstinacy is responsible for these avoidable deaths,” the statement read. “SKM also reminds the Prime Minister that the agitation of farmers is not just for the repeal of the three black laws, but also for a statutory guarantee of remunerative prices for all agricultural produce and for all farmers,” it added. The occupy movement at UP Gate has resulted in thousands of daily commuters taking alternate routes to enter Delhi. A huge volume of traffic also passes through the Kaushambi township near the Anand Vihar-Kaushambi border. “We see the development as a welcome sign, but we think that there is no immediate relief coming our way. Thousands of vehicles pass through out township every day. So, we will wait for the developments and hope they get resolved soon to benefit thousands of commuters,” said VK Mittal, president of the Kaushambi township residents welfare association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-at-up-gate-welcome-pm-s-announcement-but-agitation-to-continue-101637306287117.html
19-11-2021||India||India-China ties going through a 'bad patch': EAM S Jaishankar||External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said on Friday that India and China are going through a "particularly bad patch" in their ties because Beijing has taken a set of actions in violation of agreements for which it still doesn't have a "credible explanation" and it is for the Chinese leadership to answer where they want to take the bilateral relationship."I don't think the Chinese have any doubt on where we stand on our relationship and what's not gone right with it. I’ve been meeting my counterpart Wang Yi a number of times. As you would've experienced, I speak fairly clear, reasonably understandably (and) there is no lack of clarity so if they want to hear it, I am sure they would have heard it," Jaishankar said in response to a question at a panel "Greater Power Competition: The Emerging World Order" at the Bloomberg New Economic Forum here."We are going through a particularly bad patch in our relationship because they have taken a set of actions in violation of agreements for which they still don’t have a credible explanation and that indicates some rethink about where they want to take our relationship, but that’s for them to answer," he further said, in an apparent reference to the eastern Ladakh border clash with China.The eastern Ladakh border standoff between the Indian and Chinese militaries erupted on May 5 last year following a violent clash in the Pangong lake areas and both sides gradually enhanced their deployment by rushing in tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry.The tension escalated following a deadly clash in Galwan Valley on June 15 last year.As a result of a series of military and diplomatic talks, the two sides completed the disengagement process in the north and south banks of the Pangong lake in February and in the Gogra area in August. The last round of military talks on October 10 ended in a stalemate.Meanwhile, on Thursday the two sides agreed to hold the 14th round of military talks at an early date to achieve the objective of complete disengagement in remaining friction points along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.Jaishankar also dismissed as "ridiculous" the notion that the United States has been strategically contracting and yielding space to others amidst a global rebalancing of power.He said that the US is today, a much more flexible partner, much more open to ideas, suggestions, and working arrangements than in the past."Don't confuse it with the decline of the United States. I think that's ridiculous," he said in response to a question from the moderator at the session, also attended by former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair."It's clear China has been expanding. But the nature of China, the manner of its growing influence is very different. And we don't have a situation where China necessarily replaces the United States. Well, it's natural to think of China, US (and) China as the overarching happening. The fact is, there are also a lot of other countries including India, which have come much more into play. There's been a rebalancing in the world,” he said.Citing QUAD as an example, he pointed out that some countries are coming together on a certain set of concerns and issues or interests. The Quad comprising India, Japan, the US and Australia was formed to develop a new strategy to keep the critical sea routes in the resource-rich Indo-Pacific free of any influence.He said the United States is today, a much more flexible partner, much more open to ideas, suggestions, and working arrangements than in the past. "I think this reflects a very different kind of world. We are moving into a world in a sense, you could say, the real transitions after 1992 are now occurring."The minister also elaborated on a question about how the world is changing. "It is certainly not unipolar and it is not really really bipolar either. There are many more players. A lot of what we are doing in terms of repositioning, working with countries, (it) is multipolar work," he said."In a sense, it is partly a hedging strategy, partly autonomous partnership, often very issue based (as) we work with different countries on different sets of issues," said Jaishankar.Noting that the COVID has called into question the old model of globalisation, he said, "we are actually at multiple levels in a very, very complex transition."He pointed out that countries are willing to pay additional costs for a greater sense of security."We all want more reliable, more resilient supply chains. We want more options. Many of us were in touch during that period and went through very difficult issues. It could have been on health, even in some cases on food. So we are actually at multiple levels in a very, very complex transition. The transition, some of it is with the rise and fall and the rebalancing of powers,” he said."The transition some of it is with the rise and fall and the rebalancing of powers. Some of it is many more players. Some of it is that our concept of what is national security has changed. We think much more of economic security, much more of health security, much more of digital security,” he said.He said that in the old days, it didn't matter beyond a point what the neighbour's domestic system was."Today, issues of trust and transparency are much more relevant in a data driven world. So it does matter to me what the character of my partner is, who they are partners with. So these are all new factors, which I would suggest is really taking the world in a very, very different direction," he said.Obviously, India would like to see how its interests are best served and those interests today are definitely served with a much closer relationship with the United States, with a much stronger relationship with Europe, and the UK as well as re-energising the relationships with the ASEAN and especially Singapore, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indiachina-ties-going-through-a-bad-patch-eam-s-jaishankar-101637304841750.html

The landmark decision was announced after nearly a year-long protest against the reform laws, on the occasion of Guru Nanak  Jayanti.Protesting farmers distributed jalebis at the Ghazipur border and raised slogans of "Kisan Zindabad" celebrating their victory over the government's decision to pass the ordinances enacted last year.Others were seen dancing on the streets and distributing sweets amongst each other.Here are a few glimpses:“Today, I have come to tell you, the whole country, that we have decided to withdraw all three agricultural laws. In the Parliament session starting later this month, we will complete the constitutional process to repeal these three agricultural laws,” the Prime Minister said in a televised speech earlier today, urging the agitators to go back to their homes.The winter session of the Parliament begins on November 29. Interestingly, the decision comes months before five states, including agri-hubs of Punjab and Uttar Pradesh where there is opposition to the farm laws, will hold assembly elections.Many leaders congratulated the farmers for their relentless efforts that have finally proved fruitful. Farmers – mainly from western Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, and Haryana among other states – have been camping at various entry points to Delhi for almost a year. “Congratulations its win against the injustice, the farmers of the nation have compelled the arrogant govt to bend down through satyagraha,” said Congress leader Rahul Gandhi.Meanwhile, Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait said that the protests will not die down yet. “The agitation will not be withdrawn immediately, we will wait for the day when agricultural laws will be repealed in Parliament. Along with the MSP, the government should also discuss other issues of farmers,” he tweeted.The Samyukta Kisan Morcha, which has been at the forefront of the protest, also resonated with the statement and said that they “will wait for the announcement to take effect through due parliamentary procedures”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-at-ghazipur-celebrate-with-jalebis-as-pm-modi-repeals-farm-laws-101637299075390.html

He also asked the farmers to end their stir, which has continued for more than a year now.Addressing the nation on the auspicious occasion of Guru Nanak Jayanti, the Prime Minister also apologised to farmers and said, the government could not convince a section of farmers despite its clear heart and clean conscience.Farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, have been staging a sit-in at Delhi borders since last November last year to protest against the three legislation. The laws were enacted by Parliament in September last year.These laws are the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act. According to the announcement, the laws will be scrapped in the upcoming winter session of the Parliament.Here are the key highlights of the address:"I appeal to all the farmers who are part of the protest... to now return to your home, to your loved ones, to your farms, and family. Let's make a fresh start and move forward.""Friends, I apologise to the countrymen and want to say with a clean heart and conscience that we must have fallen short in our efforts to explain (the benefits of the farm laws) to a section of the farmers.""The objective of the three farm laws was that the farmers of the country, especially small farmers should be strengthened, they should get the right price for their produce and maximum options to sell the produce."PM Modi also announced a "formation of a committee to promote zero budgeting based agriculture, to change crop pattern as per the changing needs of the country and to make MSP more effective and transparent."The Committee will have representatives of the central government, state governments, farmers, agricultural scientists, and agricultural economists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lets-take-fresh-start-what-pm-modi-said-in-his-address-today-101637303288450.html

19-11-2021||India||Priyanka Gandhi says PM Modi didn't care about farmers, 'electoral defeat' prompted decision on farm laws||Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi on Friday hit out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi for “ignoring” the protests against the contentious farm laws for months only to repeal them after “seeing defeat” in the elections. In a series of tweets, the Congress general secretary said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi didn’t care either about the “martyrdom of over 600 farmers” or the Lakhimpur Kheri incident where protesting farmers were run over by the car of a Union minister’s son.She alleged that leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) insulted farmers by calling them “terrorists, traitors, goons, miscreants”, adding that the prime minister himself called the agitators ‘andolanjeevi’. Priyanka Gandhi said that it’s difficult to trust the prime minister’s intention and his “changed attitude.”“Now that you have started seeing the defeat in the elections, you suddenly started to understand the truth of this country - that this country has been made by the farmers, this country belongs to the farmers, the farmer is the true caretaker of this country and no government can rule the country by crushing the interest of the farmers,” she tweeted.600 से अधिक किसानों की शहादत350 से अधिक दिन का संघर्ष, @narendramodi जी आपके मंत्री के बेटे ने किसानों को कुचल कर मार डाला, आपको कोई परवाह नहीं थी। आपकी पार्टी के नेताओं ने किसानों का अपमान करते हुए उन्हें आतंकवादी, देशद्रोही, गुंडे, उपद्रवी कहा, आपने खुद आंदोलनजीवी बोला..1/3Priyanka Gandhi is leading the Congress' campaign in Uttar Pradesh for the upcoming Assembly elections and has ruled out a pre-poll alliance with any political party.Earlier today, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the Central government will repeal the three contentious farm laws as it failed to convince “a section of farmers” about the “benefits” of the legislation.“To make MSP more effective and transparent, a committee will be constituted to take decisions on all such issues, keeping in view the future. The committee will have representatives from central government, state governments, farmers, agricultural scientists, agricultural economists,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/priyanka-gandhi-says-pm-modi-didn-t-care-about-farmers-electoral-defeat-prompted-decision-on-farm-laws-101637301557012.html

In a tweet, Kejriwal said the announcement made on Prakash Diwas (birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh) is happy news. “All three (farm) laws repealed. More than 700 farmers have been martyred. Their martyrdom will be remembered forever. The coming generations will remember how the farmers of our country put their lives on stake to save farming and farmers. My greetings to the farmers of the country,” he tweeted.Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia also congratulated the farmers’ movement. “Your one year long peaceful movement has forced the government to bow down. The central government had to bow down before the martyrdom of hundreds of farmers. The government should also seek apology from families whose members have passed away during this farmers’ movement,” Sisodia tweeted.AAP has been expressing its support for the farmers’ movement. Last year in November, the Delhi government denied police permission to convert nine stadiums in the city into temporary detention centres in light of the farmers’ agitation. Several Delhi government functionaries and ministers visited the protest sites on Delhi’s borders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/my-greetings-to-farmers-kejriwal-welcomes-centre-s-announcement-to-repeal-farm-laws-101637301787974.html

Modi said a section of farmers remained unconvinced about the benefits of the laws, prompting the government to take such a decision.

They sought the guaranteed Minimum Support Price (MSP) to ensure procurement of crops at a suitable price -- The farmers were also demanding written assurance for the continuation of MSP and conventional food grain procurement system-- They have sought MSP as recommended by the Swaminathan Commission. The panel said the government should raise MSP to at least 50% more than the weighted average cost of production-- The farmers’ organisations want the Mandi System to be protected-- They also demanded the withdrawal of Electricity (Amendment) Bill 2020 as they feel that they would not get free electricity due to it-- The farmers also demanded an end to the fines and jail sentences imposed for stubble burning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/three-farm-laws-to-be-repealed-what-farmers-wanted-101637297948498.html

The guidelines seek to make the terminals and stops more accessible by introducing a uniform set of norms for all states to follow while constructing such facilities.The “accessibility guidelines for bus terminals and bus stops” were issued on Tuesday and sought comments from stakeholders until December 16. There are no set standards for states to follow while building bus terminals and stops. Once notified, these guidelines will be a reference in creating accessible public transit modes, officials said.“There are guidelines available on universal accessibility but there have been very limited attempts to develop comprehensive guidelines for road transportation to improve accessibility for persons with disabilities for services in bus terminals and bus stops. These guidelines focus significantly on extending accessibility options to wheelchair users, people with limited walking/ movement abilities, people with visual impairment or low vision, people with hearing impairment, elderly and infirm persons, pregnant ladies and children,” say the guidelines, seen by HT.The guidelines say signage should be in the vision zone of 900-1800 mm to be clearly visible to wheelchair-bound people. For white cane users or the visually impaired, the guidelines mandate the states to ensure there are no protruding objects such as directional signs, tree branches, wires, ropes, public telephone booths, benches, and ornamental fixtures.“These should be installed keeping in mind the range of a person using a white cane. A barrier or sounding object to warn visually impaired persons should be provided under stairways or escalators. Walkways, halls, corridors, passageways, aisles, or other circulation spaces should have clear headroom to minimise the risk of accidents. The radial range of the white cane is a band 1200 mm wide.”The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates the government to ensure access to all modes of transport that conform with design standards, including retrofitting old modes wherever technically feasible and safe for persons with disabilities and without entailing major structural changes. Under the law, the government is supposed to take suitable measures to provide facilities for the disabled at bus stops, railway stations and airports.The guidelines say the difference in level between the driveway and footpath surface should be avoided. “Where the difference is unavoidable, such drop shall have a kerb ramp. Tactile floor guidance to be provided from the building drop-off area leading up to the entrance of the building.” They say an access route should be provided connecting all major entrances and exits of the building from the alighting and boarding point of taxi stands and car park lots for persons with disabilities. “In multi-storey buildings, the accessible entrance must have an accessible route leading to the elevators. The accessible entrance, if different from the main entrance, should be located adjacent to the main entrance and not at the rear of the building.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-issues-draft-norms-to-make-bus-terminals-stops-more-accessible-101637296267719.html

Police maintained that the two men were “overground workers” of terror outfits and were killed in the crossfire. But their families said that the two were used as human shields and called the killings “cold-blooded murders”. Police buried Bhat and Gul in Handwara in the absence of their families, citing “law and order concerns”.The bodies were exhumed in presence of a magistrate and handed over to the families around midnight for burial. Officials asked families to restrict the burial rites to close relatives and sought assurances from them. Heavy police deployments were made around the houses of Dar and Gul.Watch: J&K govt orders probe into Srinagar gunfight that left 2 civilians deadInspector general (Kashmir) Vijay Kumar said there would not be any restrictions in Srinagar.The Jammu and Kashmir administration separately ordered a magisterial probe into the gunfight on Wednesday.The families of the two civilians staged a sit-in in Srinagar on Wednesday and held a candlelight vigil after the day-long protest, demanding that the bodies of the two men be handed to them.

In the Parliament session starting later this month, we will complete the constitutional process to repeal these three agricultural laws,” the PM said in a televised speech.A section of farmers in Punjab and Haryana and in some parts of Uttar Pradesh have been protesting for the last one year demanding the repeal of the three farm laws despite the Centre’s continued efforts to break the logjam.The government held multiple rounds of talks with representatives of the protesting farmers and tried to underline the benefits that they offered to small famers, but the protesters remained adamant on seeking the repeal of all three laws: the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020, that were passed amid a din in Parliament during the monsoon session last year.Also Read: Huge victory of farmers movement, says AAP on repeal of agri lawsIn his address to the nation, the PM Modi said it was unfortunate that despite the government’s intentions to strengthen and empower farmers particularly those who have small land holdings, many of them were not convinced about the benefits of the laws, and therefore, the government has decided to set in motion the process of repealing all three laws.The prime minister said the bills were meant to benefit the farmers, but they couldn’t be convinced “despite our best efforts”.Modi underlined how his government had prioritised welfare of farmers and drafted policies and interventions such as introducing soil health cards, crop insurance and credit cards to empower famers.“The agriculture budget has been increased five times and a ₹1 lakh crore agriculture infrastructure fund has been set up… to empower smaller farmers… 10,000 FPOs have been started and ₹7,000 crore spent on it,” he said.Referring to the contentious laws, he said they were brought in with the intention of giving the country’s farmers more strength and better prices for their crops, apart from more options to sell their produce.“For years, there was a demand from farmers and agri-scientists and experts. Many governments had also discussed this… this time also there was a debate in Parliament and these laws were brought in,” the PM said.He stressed that while many farmers, farm organisations and unions welcomed the laws and supported it, the government, despite its best intentions, could not convince a section of the farmers who were unable to understand the benefits of the laws.“Though it’s a small section of farmers who are protesting, but even then, it is important for us. Agri-experts and scientists and progressive farmers have tried, made efforts to make them understand with an open mind… we tried to keep explaining through various means, personal as well as collective” the PM said.Modi also said that the government has taken another important decision related to the agriculture sector, which is to promote zero budget farming.He said scientifically changing the crop pattern will be undertaken keeping in mind the requirements of the country. He also said minimum support price (MSP) will be made more effective and transparent, and a committee will be constituted to take decisions on all matters related to the issue. The committee will have representation from the central government, the state governments, farmers, agricultural scientists and agricultural economists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-will-repeal-all-three-farm-laws-says-pm-modi-101637294466021.html

19-11-2021||India||Gurupurab today, celebrations subdued due to Covid-19 restrictions||The Sikh community across the world is celebrating Guru Purab on Friday. Also known as Guru Nanak Jayanti, the festival is one of the most sacred festivals for Sikhs as it marks the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak, who established Sikhism.The festival is celebrated with great zeal around the world. In India especially, devotees take out a procession in their areas. It is followed by langar (devotional food offering). The devotees also visit Gurudwara and offer prayers.However, due to the coronavirus restrictions, the celebrations are expected to be subdued like last year. Earlier Gurupurab used to be celebrated with great zeal. There used to be arrangements for food -- stalls of golgappas, tikkis -- all free sewa (service). People used to be full of enthusiasm and energy, ANI quoted a member of Gurdwara Gurmat Parchar Sabha, under the management of Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee, as saying. "However, this could not be organised anymore because of Covid-19 protocols," he added.The festivities in the Sikh religion revolve around the anniversaries of the 10 Sikh Gurus -- Guru Nanak Dev, Guru Angad Dev, Guru Amar Das, Guru Ram Das, Guru Arjan Dev, Guru Hargobind, Guru Har Rai, Guru Har Krishan, Guru Tegh Bahadur, and Guru Gobind Singh.These Gurus were responsible for shaping the beliefs of the Sikh religion and their birthdays, known as Gurpurab, are occasions for celebration and prayer among the Sikhs.Every year, the date varies for Guru Purab according to the traditional lunar calendar. While Diwali falls on the 15th day of the Kartik month as per the Hindu Lunar calendar, Guru Nanak Jayanti falls fifteen days after that on the auspicious occasion of Kartik Purnima.Guru Nanak was born in 1469 at Nankana Sahib. It is believed that his birth was a mark of divinity. He firmly believed that an individual could connect to God through sincere prayers and didn't encourage traditions that included sacrifices. All his teachings and preachings are composed together to form the sacred book called Guru Granth Sahib.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gurupurab-today-celebrations-subdued-due-to-covid-19-restrictions-101637290805087.html

19-11-2021||India||India Gandhi: Remembering country's first female PM on her 104th birthday||Friday marks the 104th birth anniversary of India's first and, to date, the only female Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, who was also known as 'Iron Lady' of the country.Born on November 19, 1917, as Indira Priyadarshini Gandhi, she was the daughter of the country's first prime minister Dr Jawahar Lal Nehru. During her life, she played a central role in the functioning of Indian National Congress (INC).In 1959, India Gandhi was elected as president of the INC. She was appointed as a member of Rajya Sabha after her father died in 1964 and served as the Union minister of Information and Broadcasting in Lal Bahadur Shastri's cabinet.She succeeded Shastri as the next Prime Minister of India, outflanking other leaders in the leadership battle. Indira Gandhi served her first term in the office from 1966 to 1977, and the second was from 1981 to 1984, until her assassination at the hands of her own security guards. After Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi is longest serving prime minister of the country.According to reports, India Gandhi became such a dominating figure at the end of 1977, and made such an impression on the political canvas of the country that then Congress party president DK Barooah had coined the phrase "India is Indira and Indira is India."In 1999, Indira Gandhi was dubbed as “Woman of the Millennium” via an online BBC poll. Most recently (2020) she was named as one of the world’s 100 powerful women who defined the last century by Time magazine.(WIth agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-gandhi-remembering-country-s-first-female-pm-on-her-104th-birthday-101637284960604.html

19-11-2021||India||Congress revamps its disciplinary committee||The Congress party, busy tackling in-house rebels and issues related to discipline, revived its disciplinary committee on Thursday ahead of its organisational elections.Party veteran AK Antony continues to head the panel while Ambika Soni, Tariq Anwar, JP Agarwal and G Parameswar are its other members.A senior party functionary said that G Parameswar, former Karnataka PCC (pradesh Congress committee) chief and former deputy CM, has been given a central post in a balancing act since the state leadership is now tightly in control of DK Shivakumar and Siddaramaiah.While Ambika Soni remains one of the most trusted lieutenants of Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Tariq Anwar has been brought in to give additional responsibilities to the veteran leader who rejoined the Congress from the NCP a few years ago.Former Delhi PCC chief JP Aggarwal has been included in the committee that handles all issues related to discipline and can recommend action to the Congress president. While the party has such state-level panels, this central disciplinary panel handles cases at the AICC (All India Congress Committee) level.The circular, signed by general secretary organisation KC Venugopal, mentioned that the appointments have come with immediate effect.The AICC also appointed seven national coordinators in the data analytics panel led by Praveen Chakravarthy.A second party leader added that in view of the membership drive related to the organisational polls, there is a lot of data-related work to be done as the party also goes online to invite people to join the Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-revamps-its-disciplinary-committee-101637276102515.html
19-11-2021||India||Supreme Court pulls up Gujarat government over Covid-19||The Supreme Court on Thursday pulled up the Gujarat government for being “insensitive to the suffering” of families of the those who died from Covid-19, making them run around for the compensation of ₹50,000.The court was considering an application filed by a Gujarat-based lawyer Amit Panchal against an October 29 notification by the Gujarat Health and Family Welfare department requiring beneficiaries to move a representation before a committee that will issue documents certifying Covid-19 deaths.The bench of justices MR Shah and BV Nagarathna said, “After going through the October 29 order constituting the ‘Covid-19 Death Ascertaining Committee,it appears an attempt is being made to overreach our order.” The bench was referring to its October 4 judgment.“Government should not be so insensitive to understand the suffering of persons who have already suffered a lot,” the bench added. Over 10,000 people have died of Covid-19in the state till date. Solicitor GeneralTushar Mehta, appearing for thestate government assured that cor-rective steps will be taken by the nextdate. The bench posted the matterfor next hearing on November 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-pulls-up-gujarat-government-over-covid19-101637275556601.html
19-11-2021||India||50% of disappearances in illegal mining zones||The Kundera and Talada ranges in Rajasthan’s Ranthambore Tiger Reserve accounted for half the 12 tigers gone missing since last year, wildlife watchers and forest department officials said on Thursday. There is no sign of the tigers till now.Although forest department officials blamed congestion at one of the country’s most crowded reserves, and territorial fights caused by it, wildlife activists said the tigers disappeared from the two zones where illegal mining and human-animal conflict were high.Officials said six of the 12 tigers went missing between January 2020 and March 2021 from the Kundera and Talada ranges, spread across 125 sq km. Conservation biologist Dharmendra Khandal said a considerable number of tigers going missing from a specific area indicates abnormal activity. “Infighting for territory cannot happen at only one place in the reserve.”He added that the number of tigers that went missing has been highest in 18 years, and that too from specific parts of the reserve.“Earlier, annually two to three tigers went missing unnoticed. Now it has more than doubled...”Khandal said that poaching cannot be ruled out and that there has been an increase in cases of electrocutions as a result of unethical crop protection methods. “Wire snaring has also been a problem. In December 2020, male tiger T-108 was rescued from a wire snare...after timely intelligence...Illegal mining has also been reported from this area.”In March, the Ranthambore administration started a search for at least four tigers missing for a year, but to no avail.One official said the two ranges are among the three major migratory routes for the big cats, indicating the tigers may have left the reserve. He said these routes lead to Karauli and Bundi in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh’s Kuno Palpur. The forest department has not found any traces of the missing tigers either in Karauli or Bundi.The official, who asked not to be named, said the tiger population was increasing in the reserve and over two dozen cubs were born there last year. “When the density of tigers increases, territorial fights are obviously leading to the exit of the weaker ones,” he contended.Divisional forest officer (Kuno Palpur) PK Verma said they were unable to find any trace either. “We have not found any pug marks or sign of movement of tigers in the Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary and nearby areas over the last 8-10 months,” he said.Kuno is expected to get up to six cheetahs from Namibia early next year and surveillance of wildlife has been increased in preparation for the relocation.Ranthambore Tiger Reserve director Tikam Chandra Verma said there was no territory left for tigers inside the park and, therefore, they have migrated. “We are working with the state government on dealing with the congestion issue.”An Indian Forest Service officer, who has worked in Ranthambore, said a tiger can go missing because of territorial fights or migration. “...if (they go missing) from a specific area, there could be a possible exit.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/50-of-disappearances-in-illegal-mining-zones-101637270660210.html
19-11-2021||India||Uniform civil code is a necessity, mandatorily required today: HC||The Allahabad high court on Thursday called upon the Centre to look into implementing the mandate of Article 44 of the Constitution, which says that the “state shall endeavour to secure for the citizens a uniform civil code throughout the territory of India”.“The UCC is a necessity and mandatorily required today. It cannot be made ‘purely voluntary’ as was observed by Dr BR Ambedkar 75 years back, in view of the apprehension and fear expressed by the members of the minority community,” news portal livelaw quoted the court as saying.Hearing a batch of 17 petitions moved by interfaith couples, who had approached the court seeking registration of their marriages and protection from private respondents, justice Suneet Kumar said it is the need of the hour that Parliament comes up with a “single family code” to protect interfaith couples from being “hounded as criminals”.“The stage has reached that Parliament should intervene and examine, as to whether, the country requires multiplicity of marriage and registration laws or the parties to a marriage should be brought under the umbrella of single family code,” the court observed.The standing counsel, appearing for the state government, pointed out that the petitioners’ marriage could not be registered without an enquiry by the district authority as they did not get the mandatory approval from district magistrate before converting to the faith of their partner for the purpose of marriage.The petitioners’ counsel, however, asserted that citizens have the right to choose their partner and faith; and the conversion took place out of free will.“Interference by the State or by the private respondents (family members) would tantamount to encroaching upon their constitutional right to freedom, choice, life, liberty and to live life on their own terms as man and woman,” the counsel said, adding that prior approval of the district authority followed by registration of marriage is not a sine qua non (an essential condition) before conversion and marriage.The bench then observed that: “Marriage is just an association of two persons, recognized by law. There is nothing ‘special’ about marriage to subject it under different laws for various communities, thus erecting barriers in the free intermingling of the citizens. The petitioners, herein, cannot be hounded as criminals...”The court later directed the marriage registrar/officer of the petitioners’ districts to forthwith register the marriage of the petitioners, without insisting/awaiting approval of the competent district authority with regard to the conversion of faith.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uniform-civil-code-is-a-necessity-mandatorily-required-today-hc-101637268980638.html
19-11-2021||India||‘Could have considered if… ’: SC declines last-minute plea on CBSE, CISCE board exams||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday dismissed a petition to provide an online option for students of class 10 and class 12 appearing for the term one board examination conducted by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and Council for Indian School Certificate (CISCE).Six students appearing for these examinations approached the court challenging the decision of the two boards to hold examinations in the ‘offline’ mode at a time when the pandemic was far from over.CBSE is holding the examination for 34 lakh students of classes 10 and 12. While the CBSE exam started on November 16, the exams conducted by CISCE will begin on Monday.Dismissing the petition, a bench of justices AM Khanwilkar and CT Ravikumar said, “As the examination has commenced from November 16, it would be inappropriate to intervene and disturb the entire process at this belated stage.” The bench indicated that some relief could be considered if this petition was filed earlier.Senior advocate Sanjay Hedge, appearing for the petitioner students, said persons with co-morbidities who are staying at home may be affected if children are forced to give the examination physically. There was also a possibility of crowding at these examination centres that could expose them to the risk of Covid-19 infection.CBSE ruled out these apprehensions, citing steps taken by it to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta with advocate Rupesh Kumar for CBSE told the court that it will not be possible to put in place a virtual setup when examinations have already begun.The law officer listed out the precautions taken which include restricting 12 students in each classroom, increasing examination centres from 6,500 to 15,000 to reduce the commuting distance for students, and holding a 90-minute test instead of the conventional three-hour examination.The bench was satisfied with these measures and said, “We hope and trust that the authorities will take all measures to ensure that all students and duty holders are not exposed to any untoward situation.”The court was also critical of the petitioners who approached the court at the last minute. “We have to discourage this last-minute filing of petitions giving hope to students. Don’t mess up with the education system. Let them continue to do their job well,” the bench told Hegde.Hedge said an online option could be considered as the test consists of multiple-choice questions. The bench said, “The examination is being conducted for 34 lakh students. With this kind of examination, the situation will become chaotic. We could have considered it if you had approached earlier.”The decision to hold the examination in the offline mode was taken by the two boards in October. The petition was filed on November 11. The matter was taken up by the top court on November 15 when the petitioners were directed to serve their petition to the CBSE and CISCE.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/could-have-considered-if-sc-declines-last-minute-plea-on-cbse-cisce-board-exams-101637264224951.html

There is a section which is trying to create public opinion and hatred against the government. We can call this urban naxalisation,” Pawar was quoted as saying by news agency PTI. Pawar used the term ‘urban naxal’, which is commonly used by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders, claiming that Maoists have hidden supporters and sympathisers in India’s major cities.The NCP supremo’s comments come days after the state police gunned down at least 26 Maoists along with their senior leader Milind Teltumbde. An encounter took place in Korchi in the Mardintola forest area of eastern Maharashtra between Maoists and the C-60 police commando team on Saturday morning.Pawar, however, said that the situation in the district is now improving but asked to exercise caution over the ‘new phenomenon’ of certain elements creating ‘hatred against the government in other parts of the state’.The former Maharashtra chief minister said that new problems will emerge if these issues are not addressed. “Special caution should be taken about this aspect immediately, otherwise new problems would emerge,” he added.The former Union minister also said that industrial projects in the Gadchiroli region may help its development. “I feel that to remove the frustration of the young generation here, they should get job opportunities. Surjagarh will give them this right and opportunity in a big way and an important and permanent industry will develop here,” Pawar said referring to the mining projects in Surjagarh in Gadchiroli which have faced protests from the locals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sharad-pawar-warns-against-urban-naxalisation-in-maharashtra-s-big-cities-101637263004769.html

We want a straight answer from the Centre. There is a limit to our patience. We shall continue our fight till the Centre spells out its policy on paddy procurement,” the chief minister said, addressing the party leaders at the dharna.In the afternoon, a delegation of TRS leaders led by agriculture minister T Niranjan Reddy, went to Raj Bhavan to submit a memorandum to Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan demanding that the Centre procure the entire paddy produced in the state.Continuing the tirade against the Centre, the chief minister said these protests were just a beginning. “The war has just begun. The TRS will join the ongoing agitation of the formers of northern India and take up cudgels on their behalf. We shall not rest till we ensure security to our farmers’ future,” he said.The chief minister sought to know whether the Modi government would allow farmers of the country to lead a happy life. “The farmers of North India have been agitating against the draconian farm laws for the last one year. But the Centre is adamantly rejecting their demands,” he alleged.He also charged the Centre with harassing farmers by forcing them to install electric meters for their agriculture motors. “In Telangana, there is no question of allowing installation of meters for farm pumpsets. We are not charging water cess from farmers; instead, ours is the only state which is going round-the-clock free power supply to agriculture,” he claimed.The chief minister pointed out that India has more than 100 million acres of land which can produce food for the entire globe. Yet, it is facing hunger. It is lagging behind Pakistan and Bangladesh in hunger index, he said.Stating that the BJP had miserably failed to administer the country, KCR alleged that whenever there were elections, it was whipping up religious passions and instigating communal clashes, besides cashing in on the patriotic sentiments of the people by enacting dramas in the name of “surgical strikes.”Reacting to KCR’s dharna, BJP leader and newly-elected Huzurabad MLA Eatala Rajender said the chief minister’s indifferent and arrogant attitude was the reason for the plight of farmers of Telangana.“In the assembly, KCR went on record that his government would purchase every single grain from farmers. Now, he has thrown up his hands and is trying to shift the blame on the government,” he alleged.Meanwhile, the Union ministry of consumer affairs, food and civil supplies made it clear that it would not purchase parboiled rice from any state hereafter, as there were more than enough buffer stocks in the country.Though the Centre asked Telangana to supply only 24.75 lakh tonnes of parboiled rice during the last Rabi season, it wanted procurement of more quantity. On its request, the Centre agreed to purchase another 20 lakh tonnes, it said.This season, the Centre had procured 60 lakh tonnes of paddy and 40 lakh tonnes of rice. “The state government, on Wednesday, requested enhancement of rice procurement target from 40 lakh tonnes to 90 per cent of the total production of 75.43 lakh tonnes. The request is under examination,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kcr-vows-to-spearhead-nation-wide-farmers-agitation-says-modi-govt-antifarmer-101637262783467.html
19-11-2021||India||AIADMK urges TN govt to continue Pongal cash bonanza for ration card holders||Chennai The opposition AIADMK on Thursday urged the Tamil Nadu government to continue the Pongal cash gift of ₹2,500, implemented by the party when it was in power, in the interest and well-being of the ration card holders in the state.The DMK government’s announcement on Wednesday on Pongal gift hampers for the family ration card holders, scrapping the cash gift has disappointed the poor during pandemic times, AIADMK coordinator O Panneerselvam claimed.“People, particularly the poor, expect the state government to provide them the much needed relief this Pongal (harvest festival in mid-January),” he said. They want the government to continue the scheme as a panacea since the lockdown enforced to contain the spread of the Coronavirus caused loss of livelihood to many, the AIADMK leader contended.“They want the government to provide the sum along with the gift hamper as life is returning to normalcy following the relaxation of restrictions,” the former Chief Minister said in a statement here.He said the AIADMK had enhanced the cash bonanza to ₹2,500 this year from ₹1,000 in the previous year for the benefit of the rice card holders in the State. Accordingly, a government order was passed allocating ₹5,604 crore. “But the present announcement has reduced the scheme to a mere ₹1,088 crore initiative to dole out only the hampers while dispensing with the cash gift implemented by the then AIADMK government,” Panneerselvam said.Apart from cash, the Pongal gift bag distributed during the AIADMK regime contained one kg rice, one kg sugar, 20 grams of cashew and raisins each, five grams of cardamom and a sugarcane.On Wednesday, the state government announced the Pongal gift hampers for 20.15 million ration rice card holders at an outlay of ₹1,088 crore. It comprises 20 items including raw rice, jaggery, cashew, raisins, cardamom, moong dal and ghee for preparing the sweet pongal. Besides, it contains turmeric powder, chilli powder, coriander powder, mustard, jeera, pepper, tamarind, Bengal gram, urad dal, rava, wheat flour, salt and a cloth bag.“I urge chief minister M K Stalin to immediately intervene and take appropriate steps to provide the Pongal cash of ₹2,500 along with the gift hampers for the sake of the poor,” Panneerselvam said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiadmk-urges-tn-govt-to-continue-pongal-cash-bonanza-for-ration-card-holders-101637262728146.html
19-11-2021||India||Michel threatens to go on hunger strike in letter to Boris Johnson||Christian Michel, the alleged middleman in the AgustaWestland VVIP helicopter deal, has written a letter to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson about his intention to go on a hunger strike from November 25 unless the British government takes action on his case. He said in his letter, handed over to a British diplomat during a consular access meeting at Delhi’s Tihar jail on November 9, that his hunger strike will continue till the UK government announces its intention to apply the “Magnitsky” sanctions regime against those involved in the “abduction” of Princess Latifa of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in international waters off the coast of India on March 4, 2018. Michel, a British national, has been held in India since December 2018 after being extradited from the UAE. He and his legal team have for long contended the UAE granted his extradition in exchange for the seizure and return of the princess. The UK established the Magnitsky or global human rights sanctions regime during 2020-21 to target those responsible for human rights violations or corruption. The name is derived from Sergei Magnitsky, a Russian tax lawyer who uncovered a $230-million fraud committed by tax officials in 2007, and was jailed on charges of tax evasion in 2008 and died in prison the following year. There was no response from Indian officials to requests for a comment on the matter. Michel was living in Dubai when India sought his extradition for involvement in alleged irregularities in the 2010 deal to acquire 12 AgustaWestland helicopters worth 556.2 million euros. At the time, he was a middleman and an external consultant for a subsidiary of AgustaWestland. Michel has denied involvement in wrongdoing and pointed to the acquittal in Italy of two senior executives of AgustaWestland as proof that there was no corruption in the deal. In March, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (WGAD), which operates under the office of the UN high commissioner for human rights, called on the Indian government to immediately release Michel as his detention was arbitrary and violated the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The external affairs ministry has rejected the UN expert panel’s findings and said the conclusions were based on “biased allegations from an unidentified source and on an inaccurate understanding of India’s criminal justice system”. In his letter to the British prime minister, which was accessed by Hindustan Times, Michel repeated his allegation that he was pressured by a senior CBI official in Dubai to sign a “false confession” naming leaders of the Congress party. “Sir, I think it is apparent that after 3 years without charge or trial there is no judicial process for political prisoners,” Michel wrote in the nine-page handwritten letter. “Prime Minister I have done all I can to work with due process for 130 days in jail in Dubai and 3 years [in] jail in India. It’s not working,” he added. “I have heard people say I am probably guilty. That is for the court to decide. All I want is a trial, I don’t even ask for a fair one.” During the November 9 meeting with Edward Bossley, the UK consul to India, Michel made it clear that he could not make a “deal because what ED/CBI wanted him to say to take a deal was simply not true”, people familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. The UK side has not publicly commented on Michel’s case but British officials, including Tariq Ahmad, the minister of state for South Asia and the Commonwealth, and former foreign secretary Dominic Raab have taken up the matter with foreign secretary Harsh Shringla, and the Indian high commissioner in London, and external affairs minister S Jaishankar between May and July this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/michel-threatens-to-go-on-hunger-strike-in-letter-to-boris-johnson-101637262664601.html
19-11-2021||India||Idukki, Mullaperiyar dams opened as Kerala braces for another wet spell||With the weather department predicting another spell of rains, shutters of Idukki and Mullaperiyar, two major dams of Kerala, were opened on Thursday to let out surplus storage of water. State water resources minister Roshy Augustine said in Idukki that dams were opened as a precautionary measure after meeting all requirements. This is the first time shutters of Idukki arch dam were opened thrice a year since it was built in 1973. Similarly Tamil Nadu opened shutters of the 126-year-old Mullaperiyar dam second time this year. Though rains subsided in other parts of the state in last couple of days, catchment areas received heavy downpour swelling dams. “Idukki dam was opened as a precaution. Now water level is manageable. We have alerted people living in downstream areas,” said the minister. Idukki district collector Sheeba George also said all precautionary measures were taken before opening both dams. The public works department of TN informed its counterpart about the decision to open Mullapeiyar after water level crossed 141 feet. It opened two shutters to release excess water -- since TN is getting heavy downpour, it is taking minimum water from Mullaperiyar for southern districts these days. Kerala dam authorities said Idukki was opened after shutters of Mullaperiyar were opened. In Idukki district alone, there are 20 big and small dams. While catchment areas of Idukki dam received 30 mm rain fall in last 24 hours in Mullaperiyar it was 22 mm. The inflow of water doubled in two dams forcing authorities to ease them immediately. Shutters of Idukki dam was opened first on October 27, second on November 14 and third on November 18. The usual rainfall in northeast monsoon in Kerala is 492 mm between October 1 and December 31, but this time between October 1 and November 15 the state received 820 mm rains against the expected fall of 392.8mm during the same period, IMD statistics show. Going by the present pattern, rainfall will be at least 200% higher than usual rate by the end of December. After a brief respite, wet condition is likely to pick up by Friday, India Meterological Department said, adding heavy rains will continue till November 21. It issued yellow alert in nine districts. The low-pressure formation in the Bay of Bengal is expected to get stronger and will make a landfall along TN-Andhra coast on Friday. This time Kerala received two heavy spells of northeast monsoon -- in October second-third week the state witnessed landslides and flash floods after torrential downpour claiming 42 lives and in November second week eight lives were lost in the second spell.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/idukki-mullaperiyar-dams-opened-as-kerala-braces-for-another-wet-spell-101637262663486.html
19-11-2021||India||Tamil Nadu seeks ₹2,629 crore from the Centre as relief for the damages||Days after heavy rain caused havoc in Chennai, the city received downpour due to another depression formed in Bay of Bengal on Thursday. Then newly formed Depression is likely to make a landfall near Chennai on Friday. More rains are expected on Friday morning after the landfall. Chennai and 15 other districts in Tamil Nadu are on red alert until Friday with schools and offices closed. Heavy rains lashed districts of Chennai, Villupuram, Thiruvanamalai, Salem, Kallakurichi and Chengalpattu but the damage was not as severe as it was during the last week’s rains. The adjacent union territory of Puducherry was also severely flooded having received 12.8 cm of rainfall from 8.30am up to 3.30pm on November 18. During the same time period Chennai received 2.9 cm of rainfall. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) issued an alert stating that Depression will cross the coast between Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh by early November 19. At 11.30am the Depression lay centered over southwest Bay of Bengal about 250km south-southeast of Chennai, 220km east-southeast of Puducherry and 210km east-northeast of Karaikal, the IMD said. “It is very likely to continue to move west-northwestwards and cross north Tamil Nadu and adjoining south Andhra Pradesh coasts around Chennai by early morning,” said the IMD. Chennai and its adjoining districts are likely to get scattered heavy to very heavy with isolated extremely heavy rain in the next 24-hour, and heavy to very heavy rain is likely to occur in the next 48-hour, S Balachandran, Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) Chennai chief said in a statement. The Tamil Nadu government on Wednesday sought aid of ₹2,629 crore from the Centre as aid for the damages caused by heavy rainfall in which 54 people lost their lives. Heavy loss to crops has also occurred in the delta districts. The rains had inundated several parts of Chennai affecting normal life. “The corporation is continuously pumping water and despite that there is one-feet water on our street,” said S Gopi, a resident and secretary of Subramanian Nagar civic welfare association in Chennai’s Kodambakkam which is in the heart of the city. Gopi lives on the first floor of his independent house and his tenants on the ground floor moved a day ago as water had entered their home. “The sewage from the manholes had begun overflowing at that time and we are still living amidst a really bad stench,” says Gopi. He said the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) commissioner Gagandeep Sigh Bedi visited their locality five times since the last rains. “Despite their efforts the water stagnated for three days last week, but civic workers were able to drain it out fully and they cleaned the entire area and we had relief for two days and now as soon as it has started raining, our locality is flooded,” Gopi said adding that a fault drain and culvert network doesn’t carry the run-off. The situation in Chennai was worse during the previous spells of heavy rains between November 6 and 7 and on November 11 when the city received 21 cm and 16 cm respectively. Chennai and Tamil Nadu received excess rainfall during this northeast monsoon season that runs from October to December. From October 1 to November 18, Chennai and Tamil Nadu received 66% and 61% of excess rainfall respectively. Based on the localities that were flooded in last week’s rain, the GCC stationed more than 700 motor pumps at vulnerable locations to drain water and advised people to stock essentials for the next two days as the city is on red alert for more rains. “We have identified these pockets, most of which are in low-lying areas and we have made alternative routes for the water to drain faster,” said Bedi. Surplus water from reservoirs was released—2,111 cubic feet of water from Chembarambakkam Lake and 7,021 cubic feet from the Poondi reservoir. Teams from State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) and four teams from National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) have been on standby in districts since last week’s rains. They have deployed 3,000 trained personnel in coastal districts for rescue operations and 2,156 people have been taken to relief camps. The Tamil Nadu government has readied a total of 5,000 relief camps across the state. In Chennai, 839 people have been accommodated in five relief camps.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-seeks-2-629-crore-from-the-centre-as-relief-for-the-damages-101637262603658.html
19-11-2021||India||BJP starts statewide campaign in Karnataka||Senior leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party commenced the state-wide ‘Janaswarajya Yatra’ on Thursday to meet the grassroots level workers and mobilize support across Karnataka for the upcoming polls. The tour is divided into four teams led by BS Yediyurappa, KS Eshwarappa, Jagadish Shettar and Nalin Kumar Kateel. ”Today, I will go to Koppala. We will start the Janaswarjya Yatra from there. There are four teams. One under our leader BS Yediyurappa, Jagadish Shettar, one under our party president (Kateel) and another under Eshwarappa. They will travel across the state and meet elected representatives and request all voters to help our party candidates win. One team will visit two districts per day,” chief minister Basavaraj Bommai said on Thursday in Bengaluru. The statements come weeks before the December 10 polls for 25 seats in the upper house of the state legislature. Those whose terms are expiring in January include BJP minister Kota Srinivas Poojary and Congress leader of the house, SR Patil, among others. The BJP, Congress and Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S) are hopeful of winning as many seats as possible to retain control over the upper house. The BJP, which has 32 seats currently, is hoping to mobilize support to get a majority in the upper house to allow easy passage of contentious bills without having to depend on their rivals for support. The Congress has 29 members and the JD(S) has 12 members currently. Several members of the opposition, especially from the JD(S), are trying to defect to the BJP to secure a seat in the upcoming polls. “Other than a couple of districts, we have sent a list of probables up (to Delhi). We are hopeful of the list getting approved by this evening. If not by tomorrow morning it will be done,” Bommai said. The state-wide tour also comes when the BJP is trying to thwart growing accusations that its senior leaders are involved in the raging Bitcoin scandal. Bommai also faces the people after the party lost the bypolls in Hanagal, in the chief minister’s home district of Haveri, which is speculated to be a backlash from the Panchamasali sub-sect and his partymen plotting against the former. The BJP had not approved the statewide tour of Yediyurappa and instead forced him to be part of the Jana Swarjya Yatra, which people aware of the developments said, was to keep the 78-year-old “under control”. The grassroots have also expressed their reservations about the possibility that new entrants may be given a chance in the upcoming MLC polls by overlooking core-party workers, which are likely to adversely impact other elections like zilla and taluka panchayat, expected to be held early next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjpstarts-statewide-campaign-in-karnataka-101637262483364.html
19-11-2021||India||Bengaluru braces as IMD warns of heavy rain||The India Meteorological Department (IMD) issued an orange alert for Bengaluru city on Thursday, predicting widespread rainfall in Karnataka over the next four days. A yellow warning is also effective in some districts of coastal Karnataka and north-interior parts of the state. On Thursday, Bengaluru witnessed continuous downpour. According to the IMD, till 5.30pm, Bengaluru received 14.12 mm of rain. In Mysuru, seven people had a narrow escape after two buildings collapsed on Wednesday night. In two separate incidents, six people were rescued from a dilapidated building and an elderly man was rescued from his house which collapsed. Both incidents were attributed to the continuous rainfall reported in the state. According to the weather department, the prediction of heavy rains is due to a network of cyclonic circulations and a low-pressure area over the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea. Bengaluru has received unseasonal rains in the months of October and November that has resulted in a few incidents of building collapse. The incessant rains have left much of the city in a pile of slushy mess, throwing the daily out of gear. Streets were also waterlogged, while motorists and pedestrians struggled to make their way through the downpour. Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) continues to make assurances of fixing the city’s infrastructure woes even though there appears nothing on the ground that inspires confidence of over 12 million residents. In Mysuru, the first building collapse was reported in Ashoka Road. According to Mysuru police officials, a portion of the two-storeyed commercial building came down around 7.55pm. “There were five people inside the building at that time. Four people were inside a mobile phone shop and one person was near to a tea stall. One more person was consuming tea at the shop’s counter. They managed to get out just in time after they heard a creaking sound coming from the building,” said police. Syed Nawaz, who was manning the tea stall, sustained minor injuries while escaping the crash. A stone fell on his shoulder and another one hit his wrist, causing scratches. Talking about the building, police said that the old building belonged to a church nearby. “From our investigation we have learnt that the church had issued eviction notices to all the tenants to vacate the building way back in 2015, since they wanted to demolish it. Many vacated but some challenged the notice in the court,” police said. Due to the same court case, Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) said they would not be removing the debris of the collapsed building and will only lift the debris that had fallen on the main road to facilitate smooth movement of traffic. In another incident, an elderly person who was trapped under the building rubble was rescued at Khille Mohalla. The incidents of buildings collapsing were also reported in Mandya and Davangere districts, but no one was injured in these incidents. Earlier on Wednesday, Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai said he has sought a report on the damage caused to the agriculture and horticulture crops due to continuous downpour in several parts of the state. Bommai said he has issued directions to officials concerned regarding the measures to be taken once the rain stops. According to Bommai, the confusion over taking up repair work in Bengaluru has been resolved and maintenance contractors should take up the repair work. Bommai explained if contractors refuse, then the civic agency should undertake road repair work and hold back the security deposit of the maintenance contractors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengaluru-braces-as-imd-warns-of-heavy-rain-101637262425909.html
19-11-2021||India||Four industrial parks to be set up for women: Karnataka government||The Karnataka government on Thursday announced that it would have four industrial parks dedicated to women in Mysuru, Dharwad, Harohalli and Kalaburagi.Murugesh Nirani, Karnataka’s minister for large and medium industries, said that this initiative would encourage women entrepreneurs and that this was the first such exclusive park anywhere in the country.“Karnataka is the first state in India to set up exclusive industrial parks dedicated to women in Mysuru, Dharwad, Kalaburagi and Harohalli. This purpose will be served if women entrepreneurs take advantage of this initiative. Women should join hands with the government in driving industrial growth by taking up entrepreneurship and providing jobs,” Nirani said, according to a statement by the department on Thursday.He was speaking after inaugurating a women entrepreneurs’ event titled ‘Together We Grow’ organised by the UBUNTU Consortium of Women Entrepreneurs Associations to mark International Women Entrepreneurship Day in Bengaluru.The statements come when the state government has been trying to get more investors to set up shop beyond Bengaluru where most of the big industries look to capitalise on the business ecosystem around India’s IT capital.This initiative to get investors to set up shop in tier-II and III cities has so far met with a lukewarm response as successive governments continue to fixate on development in Bengaluru while leaving the remaining part of the state to fend for itself. This has resulted in migration from small towns to Bengaluru, further straining the very limited resources and inadequate public infrastructure to its limits.“We are proud of the fact that today India has 13.5 – 15.7 million women-owned enterprises, representing 20% of all enterprises. Accelerating (the) quantity and quality of entrepreneurship towards such benchmarks can create over 30 million women-owned enterprises, and this is not an impossible goal,” he said.The minister added that the recent amendments to the factories act 1948 allow women to work night shifts and additional incentives to women from SC/ST communities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/four-industrial-parks-to-be-set-up-for-women-karnataka-government-101637262424803.html
19-11-2021||India||Incessant downpour washes away all the records in Karnataka||Bengaluru received 1000 % more rainfall than average in seven days from November 11 to November 17, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD) data. The average weekly rainfall in Bengaluru during November is 10.7 mm, but in the last week, the city received 118.1 mm of rain, as per the data.It was not just Bengaluru that received unusually high rainfall in the last week. The data shows that Mysuru reported a 689% increase over the normal rainfall during the same period. Similarly, Dakshina Kannada district reported a 687% increase while Mandya received a 970% increase in rainfall.According to the IMD, 17 districts in Karnataka – Dakshina Kannada, Udupi, Bengaluru Rural, Bengaluru Urban, Chamarajanagar, Chikkaballapura, Chikkamagaluru, Chitradurga, Davangere, Hassan, Kodagu, Kolar, Mandya, Mysuru, Shivamogga, Ramanagar, Tumakuru -– received large excess rainfall during this period. Districts of Uttara Kannada, Belagavi, Gadag and Haveri received excess rainfall.According to the weather department, the prediction of heavy rains is due to a network of cyclonic circulations and a low-pressure area over the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea.The Director-in-charge of India Meteorological Department (IMD) Bengaluru, Geeta Agnihotri, said that the presence of multiple weather systems is unusual. “Winter hasn’t started but the temperatures have dropped. We will see such weather at least till Saturday. We predict that after Saturday, the rainfall would reduce considerably,” said Agnihotri.Pointing out at the unusual amount of rains received in the last two months, Agnihotri said that from October 1 to November 17, Karnataka received 73 % excess rainfall. “Generally during this season, the average rainfall is 160 mm, but already we have crossed 278.88 mm rains in Karnataka,” she said.Even though several districts have been reporting excess rainfall, six districts have reported deficiency. From October 1 to November 17, Bagalkote (-53%), Bidar (-26), Kalburgi (-14), Raichur (-15), Vijayapura (-66) and Yadgir(-37), reported a deficiency in rainfall compared to normal rainfall.As the rainfall in the state continues to remain in excess, the concerns over crumbling infrastructure in the state, especially in Bengaluru, are a matter of concern. Over the past two weeks, the capital city is witnessing waterlogging on the roads and flooding in low-lying areas. Despite being one of India’s largest cities and globally reputed for technological prowess, the public infrastructure in Bengaluru remains one of the poorest in the country.Another concern has been the condition of several old buildings in the city. A month after a series of building collapses in the city, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) surveyed the dilapidated buildings in the city and identified about 570 buildings in various areas. Though zonal officials slapped demolition notices on property owners, they are yet to raze a single structure. With heavy rains continuing fear of more buildings collapsing in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/incessant-downpour-washes-away-all-the-records-in-karnataka-101637262423659.html

The city is home to several large American giants, including Intel, Cognizant, Amazon, among scores of other companies.Karnataka and other states in India have been trying to attract investors from across the globe as it looks to infuse fresh capital to overcome the impact of the pandemic on the economy.The renewed ties began after Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the USA in September.“Since that visit, Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry and Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman has come to India to continue these important discussions in advancing a range of initiatives,” the consul said.Ravin added that United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai would travel to New Delhi on November 22 to meet with her counterpart Piyush Goyal, the Union minister for commerce and industry, to discuss further partnerships.“When it comes to business, there is no stronger partner to India than the United States. We believe that India’s economic strength is not just in India’s interest, but in the interest of the United States, the region, and the world,” she said.“Since my arrival amidst the pandemic just over a year ago, I have witnessed how India’s tech sector has successfully adapted to the lockdowns and Covid-19 protocols as well as led by example in accommodating the health and well-being of their workforce while facilitating a seamless work-from-home operation,” the US consul said.Other sessions in the ongoing summit discussed AI and its growing application in daily lives.“When we look at Digital India, we have transformed it from more than a campaign”, with India processing the highest digital payments in October 2021, surpassing China. The contribution of this technology projects over $10-15 billion of the global GDP, translating to 3-4% of India’s GDP,” NT Arunkumar, MD & Country Head and Head of Innovation, Telstra India, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengaluru-tech-summit-india-us-trade-to-surpass-145bn-mark-says-us-consul-general-101637262363444.html
19-11-2021||India||Congress slams K’taka home minister for remark on MLA’s son||Reacting to the Karnataka home minister’s allegations against the son of a Congress legislator for his alleged involvement with Bitcoin scandal accused Sriki, state Congress chief DK Shivakumar on Thursday slammed Araga Jnanendra, saying that he lacked basic common sense.“Home minister is a mad man. First, he has to be sent to the NIMHANS for checking. He doesn’t know when he (hacker Srikrishna) was in Jail. He should have basic common sense in what he speaks,” Shivakumar said on Thursday.The statements come after Jnanendra made allegations that the hacker and prime accused Sriki had helped Mohammed Nalapad, the son of Congress legislator NA Harris, manipulate the results of the Youth Congress elections in January this year.The home minister was unavailable for a comment on the Congress’ latest statement on Thursday. The Congress continues to allege that Sriki has helped several senior BJP leaders launder money earned from corruption, bribery, transfer of officials and other ways through Bitcoin, which the hacker helped procure.Reiterating his government’s stand over the issue, the chief minister made it clear, “Our stand is firm. We will punish those who are involved in the alleged scam. There is no question of any leniency, whoever it may be. We will crackdown mercilessly.”“Our government arrested the accused in a drug abuse related case and has registered 3 cases against him. We have initiated the probe through Central Investigation agencies. Now you are questioning those who arrested him. What should we do now” Bommai said in Koppal district on Thursday. The BJP had earlier alleged that Sriki had connections with Siddaramaiah’s deceased son, Rakesh.“@BJP4Karnataka has alleged that my son Rakesh was seen with Sri Krishna’s friend Hemant Muddappa. Then how can we interpret the photo of @narendramodi with Nirav Modi during the 2018 World Economic Forum?,” Siddaramaiah said on Twitter, posting a picture of the alleged economic offender with the Indian Prime Minister.“@BJP4Karnataka is trying to hide their corruption by bringing the name of my deceased son. I urge @CMofKarnataka to order for Judicial enquiry by Supreme Court to investigate about #Bitcoin scam including our term,” he said.The man at the centre of the scandal, Srikrishna or Sriki, claimed that he began learning to code in Class 4 and was part of a group that hacked a cryptocurrency exchange five years ago.He was arrested by the Central Crime Branch (CCB) of police on November 17, 2020, and during his interrogation, CCB found that he was involved in a series of online crimes. He confessed to hacking and stealing from three Bitcoin exchanges, 14 company websites, including 10 poker websites, and a government portal.A statement given by the hacker, which is part of the charge sheet against him and police claims was voluntary, gives a glimpse of the life of Srikrishna, who by his own account was a genius. These details are information provided by the hacker in his voluntary statement, which has not been corroborated by the police. Police are trying to verify the claims and HT cannot independently verify them. His lawyers have opposed the claims in the charge sheet in a local Bengaluru court.He claimed to have developed his skills and joined an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) channel used by a group of black hat hackers (unethical hackers). According to him, he learned hacking from the members of this channel.He has said that over the years, he hacked into gaming sites and other online platforms and stole or manipulated data and amassed huge amounts of money or as favours to bankroll his lifestyle and addiction to drugs.Shivakumar said that the father of Sriki had gone to court alleging that his son was given drugs by the police and made to hack websites.“First, let the home minister inquire about a complaint which has already come out in the media (in which) the names of various BJP leaders have come. Let him first take a complaint on that,” he added.Siddaramaiah has said that he had no evidence to suggest that any particular person but sought a judicial inquiry into the allegations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-slams-k-taka-home-minister-for-remark-on-mla-s-son-101637262303450.html
19-11-2021||India||Sabarimala board issues clarification on ‘halal’ markings after row||The Travancore Dewasom Board (TDB) which runs the hill shrine in Sabarimala in Pathanamthitta district on Thursday informed the Kerala High Court that jaggery packets it received from a Maharashtra firm had ‘halal’ stamp on them because it exported them in bulk to Arab countries also.The TDB filed this reply after a devotee moved the HC on Wednesday questioning ‘halal’ specifications on jaggery packets and said the temple body’s move was “highly unethical and violated religious rights guaranteed under the constitution.”In the reply the TDB said the present “controversy was unwarranted and uncalled for and aimed at crippling the revenue of the temple and defaming it.”The Board said the contract for supplying jaggery was given to the firm last year and it supplied 5 lakh kg so far. It also said there are three-level rigorous testing for purity and last year enough quantities of jaggery supplied by another firm was given to a cattle feed company after it failed meet quality control parameters.Also read | Kerala high court raises questions over virtual queue system at SabarimalaThe TDB also said it sent a communiqué to the supplier, SP Sugar and Agro Private Ltd, to remove the specification from temple-bound packets.The petitioner S J R Kumar, also convenor RSS-backed Sabarimala action committee, contended that jaggery was used to make the main ‘prasadam’ (offering) ‘Aravana Payasam’ of the presiding deity, Lord Ayyappa, and the halal-certified food material is “not sattvik or pure” and it is an insult to believers.“It is really painful to see that food materials prepared after the ritual and religious practices of another religion with its certification is accepted to use main prasadam of a Hindu temple,” said the petitioner. .The temple was opened for two-month annual pilgrimage season on November 16.The newly-elevated TDM president K Ananthagopan, also a senior functionary of the ruling CPI(M), said this was part of a new campaign to defame the temple and cripple its revenue. “We will approach the cyber wing to take action against those who spread canards,” he said. But Hindu Aikya Vedi has sought a detailed probe into this. “It is an insult to the deity and teeming devotees,” said its leader R V Babu.The Board also said a massive campaign was unleashed on social media in this regard and a complaint was lodged with Sabarimala police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sabarimala-board-issues-clarification-on-halal-markings-after-row-101637262002804.html
19-11-2021||India||Pharma policy push will help india become a leader in medical sector, says PM||The government’s policy interventions in the pharmaceutical sector envisions creating an ecosystem for innovation so that India can become a leader in discovery of drugs and medical technology, said Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday.In his inaugural address at the Global Innovation Summit 2021, the PM said, “Our policy interventions are based on wide consultation with all stakeholders. We are sensitive towards the industry demands on regulatory framework and are actively working in this direction. The industry has got a major boost through the performance liked incentive schemes worth over 30,000 crores for pharmaceuticals and medical devices. The support of industry, academic world, and especially our talented youth is important. That is why we are encouraging collaboration.”He said, the industry needs to focus on two key areas – the requirements for raw materials and addressing the increasing global demand for traditional medicines.He added, “I also wish to highlight two areas which I want you to explore carefully. The first one relates to raw material requirements. When we were fighting Covid-19, we found that this was one issue that needs much more attention. We must think about ramping up domestic manufacturing of key ingredients for vaccines and medicines. The second area, relates to India’s traditional medicines. There is now significant and growing demand of these products in the international markets. Can we think of more ways to popularise our traditional medicines in the line with global requirement, scientific standards and best manufacturing practices?”The union health and chemical and fertiliser minister Mansukh Mandaviya said, “Our research policy in health is also in its advanced stages which will provide the right platform for innovation. The pandemic taught lessons and drug security is one of them. The PMs health policy envisions not only taking consideration of India but the whole world. When any countries invest in India the drug quality is as good as manufacturing in their country.”He urged “the world” to join the journey of discover in India, make in India, and invest in India. He said, with innovation he was confident that India could achieve the ambitious target of the pharmaceutical industry growing to 130 billion USD by 2030.The policy thrust has to be in strengthening regulatory framework, incentivising investment for innovation, and creating a collaborative ecosystem of industry, academia, and startups, said experts at the summit.NITI Aayog member Dr VK Paul said that the organisation was working on a system of research liked incentive that will incentivise risk taking for discovery and translation of drugs, vaccines, and biologics.“We have to be willing to take risks; we have been too cosy. Our previous journey met the objectives of the time, but the future is bleak if we do not turn in the right direction. We are looking at how the government partnership can aid risk-taking; the failure rate for drug or biologics development is 98% and that level should be accepted as success,” he said.He added that there was a need to create trust between industry and clinicians and transparent funding mechanisms so that there is no conflict of interest. “When you talk of a cardiologist who helped in the trial of a medicine, there is a conflict of interest. We have to develop a transparent funding mechanism and strengthen the pathways so that there are better trials,” he said.He criticised the small-scale trials for several drugs during the pandemic and said that without a proper well-designed large-scale trial the efforts were a waste. In contrast, he appreciated the large scale well designed clinical trials conducted by the vaccine manufacturers.He also added that practitioners of AYUSH should be trained in conducting equally well designed trials so that there is a greater acceptability of the products.Principal Scientific Advisor Prof. K VijayRaghavan stressed on integration of information technology in chemistry and biology that can help in speeding up search for novel and repourposed molecules. He also stressed on the need to smoothen out the regulatory framework without compromising on safety and risk mitigation through industry-academia participation.Secretary of department of pharmaceutical S Aparna said that the draft discussion paper on policy to promote innovation in the sector released in October focuses on regulatory framework having a bias towards innovations, creating transparency and timeliness in regulatory processes, and strengthening the regulatory body as well as the pricing authority to deal with new and innovative drugs and technology without creating hurdles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pharma-policy-push-will-help-india-become-a-leader-in-medical-sector-says-pm-101637261763985.html
19-11-2021||India||Hindutva preacher Godse killed Hinduism follower Gandhi: Congress||The Congress again took up the Hindutva versus Hinduism debate on Thursday, asking the country to choose between “the path of non-violence as dictated by Gandhi or the path on violence as told by Nathuram Godse”.“You know what the difference between Hinduism and Hindutva is—Mahatma Gandhi was a Hindu, but what Godse was, that’s Hindutva… Now the country has to decide whether it will follow the path of non-violence as dictated by Gandhi or the path on violence as told by Nathuram Godse,” Congress spokesperson, Gourav Vallabh, said, said at the party briefing on ThursdayThe statement came amid a raging controversy over a new book by former Union minister and Congress leader Salman Khurshid, Sunrise over Ayodhya: Nationhood in Our Times, in which he compares Hindutva with Boko Haram and the Islamic State.While the Congress has distanced itself from Khurshid’s comments, party leader Rahul Gandhi recently called for the need to differentiate between Hindutva and Hinduism, saying the former encourages violence and the latter preaches peace and harmony.“BJP talks about Hindutva, and we say there is a difference between Hinduism and Hindutva because if there was no difference, the name would have been the same. Hindutva does not need a Hindu or Hindu does not need Hindutva,” he said while addressing the party’s National Orientation Camp.Vallabh also questioned the contribution of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) to India’s freedom struggle.Hitting back, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesperson Tom Vadakkan said, “What Gourav has done is given a very confusing stance of the Congress party on Hinduism and Hindutva. His ignorance is on display. However, this is coming from the top of the party as well wherein Rahul Gandhi claims to be a ‘janeudhari’ but does not have knowledge of the scriptures.”On Vallabh’s remark on the RSS, he said: “Veer Savarkar and other leaders were part of the freedom struggle, but credit was given to the ones who were loyal to a particular dynasty. So, history has been contorted.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hindutva-preacher-godse-killed-hinduism-follower-gandhi-congress-101637261582792.html

We want a straight answer from the Centre. There is a limit to our patience. We shall continue our fight till the Centre spells out its policy on paddy procurement,” the chief minister said, addressing the party leaders at the dharna.In the afternoon, a delegation of TRS leaders led by agriculture minister T Niranjan Reddy went to Raj Bhavan to submit a memorandum to Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan demanding that the Centre procure the entire paddy produced in the state.Continuing his tirade against the Centre, the chief minister said these protests were just a beginning. “The war has just begun. The TRS will join the ongoing agitation of the farmers of northern India and take up cudgels on their behalf. We shall not rest till we ensure security for our farmers’ future,” he said.The chief minister sought to know whether the Modi government would allow farmers of the country to lead a happy life. “The farmers of North India have been agitating against the draconian farm laws for the last one year. But the Centre is adamantly rejecting their demands,” he alleged.He also charged the Centre with harassing farmers by forcing them to install electric meters for their agriculture motors. “In Telangana, there is no question of allowing installation of meters for farm pump-sets. We are not charging water cess from farmers; instead, ours is the only state which is giving round-the-clock free power supply to agriculture,” he claimed.The chief minister pointed out that India has more than 100 million acres of land which can produce food for the entire world. Yet, it is facing hunger. It is lagging behind Pakistan and Bangladesh in the hunger index, he said.Stating that the BJP had miserably failed to administer the country, KCR alleged that whenever there were elections, it was whipping up religious passions and instigating communal clashes, besides cashing in on the patriotic sentiments of the people by enacting dramas in the name of “surgical strikes”.Reacting to KCR’s dharna, BJP leader and newly-elected Huzurabad MLA Eatala Rajender said the chief minister’s indifferent and arrogant attitude was the reason for the plight of farmers in Telangana.“In the assembly, KCR went on record to say that his government would purchase every single grain from farmers. Now, he has thrown up his hands and is trying to shift the blame on the government,” he alleged.The Union ministry of consumer affairs, food and civil supplies made it clear that it would not purchase parboiled rice from any state hereafter, as there were more than enough buffer stocks in the country.Though the Centre asked Telangana to supply only 24.75 lakh tonnes of parboiled rice during the last Rabi season, it wanted procurement of more quantity. On its request, the Centre agreed to purchase another 20 lakh tonnes, it said.This season, the Centre had procured 60 lakh tonnes of paddy and 40 lakh tonnes of rice. “The state government, on Wednesday, requested enhancement of rice procurement target from 40 lakh tonnes to 90 per cent of the total production of 75.43 lakh tonnes. The request is under examination,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kcr-vows-to-lead-nationwide-farmers-agitation-calls-the-centre-antifarmer-101637261463372.html

But Parliament is made for debate.”Even as the minister didn’t refer to any particular incident, the monsoon session seemed to be the immediate reference as the House, especially the Rajya Sabha, saw chaotic scenes and continuous disruptions.An aggressive Opposition launched vociferous protests on the last day of the session when the government brought a bill to amend the general insurance laws. After the commotion, House officials lodged an official complaint against some MPs with Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu and at least nine ministers, including Thakur, demanded action against those MPs.Also read | As winter session approaches, Anurag Thakur rues disruptions in ParliamentParticipating in the presiding officers’ conference on Thursday, Thakur said that “when people are low on data and substance in their speech, they dance on the table and tear papers”.“Papers can be torn up on the streets, but Parliament is meant for debate. We have to improve the quality of the debate. We can also think, how to take cues from this conference and improve the quality of our debate,” the minister said.The winter session of Parliament will start from November 29 and the Opposition is again gearing up to protest over several issues -- the Pegasus snooping controversy, the Rafale deal, the farm laws, and the recent ordinances providing for the extension of the terms of ED and CBI chiefs.The minister suggested parliamentary committees and assemblies can consider 75 topics for special discussions to mark the 75th year of Independence. He also suggested that “legislative weeks” can be organised in various states to spread awareness among people on how policies and legislative action impact their lives. Thakur pointed out that Aadhaar, the Aadhaar-enabled direct benefit transfer system, and the Goods and Services Tax law had been of great help to people.The minister suggested an intense debate on future legislation addressing long-term requirements, including new policies or laws on the environment in the context of rising air pollution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/papers-torn-in-streets-parliament-is-for-debate-anurag-thakur-warns-opposition-101637260625219.html

I want all major issues to be discussed in the House. I am hopeful that the winter session will run smoothly,” Birla said.Opposition parties have questioned the motive behind the promulgation of an ordinance just two weeks before the session and pointed out that in the current Lok Sabha, only 12% bills have been referred to House panels. But Birla maintained that “it is for the government to decide which bill would be sent to a committee for review. My responsibility is to ensure as many lawmakers as possible participate in the debate on the legislative business.” In the previous (16th) Lok Sabha, 27% of the bills were, and in the 15th, 71% were.The winter session is scheduled from November 29 to December 23.While Birla will call a customary all-party meeting ahead of the session, top Opposition leaders are expected to meet before the session to decide its floor strategy. With elections in UP, Punjab and Uttarakhand due in less than four months, Opposition parties are likely to take an aggressive stance on key issues.The conference approved a resolution that “there should be no disruption during the Presidential address and the motion of thanks on it”. It also resolved to prepare the ground for “One India, one legislative rule” and curbing disruptions. One of the main reports on anti-defection, however, eluded consensus over redefining the Speaker’s role in such cases.Birla said, “The report was submitted but we couldn’t arrive at a consensus. There will be further discussions on some parts of the report.”Birla later said that in the 2001 chapter of the conference, it was resolved to end disruptions and protests in the well of the House. “But now”, Birla said, “We might have to again hold discussions with political parties on how to maintain decorum.”After the PM pitched for the concept of “one nation, one legislative rule”, the Lok Sabha will prepare model rules for uniform application, but a cautious Birla added that this “will just be a model rule”.“We will not force any assembly to accept it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-talk-to-all-parties-ls-speaker-om-birla-calls-for-smooth-run-of-winter-session-101637260443592.html
19-11-2021||India||Sant Samiti seeks Akhilesh apology for ‘chillumjeevi’ remark||Samajwadi Party (SP) national president Akhilesh Yadav’s ‘chillumjeevi’ remark during a rally stirred up a fresh row on Thursday, with the Akhil Bharatiya Sant Samiti -- an umbrella body of Hindu seers-- demanding an apology for the “inappropriate comments on Sanatan Dharma”.The controversy comes a day after Yadav took a dig at the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), during the SP’s ‘Vijay Rath Yatra’ from Ghazipur to Lucknow as part of its poll campaign, saying that ‘chillumjeevi ‘ (those who smoke chillum) cannot take Uttar Pradesh on the path of happiness and development. UP goes to polls early next year.“.... I see a rainbow of colours in front of me. The people who love only one colour cannot bring colour in anyone’s life. We Samajwadis take along everyone with us. But the ones who love only one colour and the chillumjeevis cannot take UP on path of happiness,” said Yadav while addressing a gathering in Ghazipur, targeting the Bharatiya Janata Party.Hitting back, Swami Jitendranand Saraswati, national general secretary of the Samiti, said:  “Akhilesh Yadav’s inappropriate statement has angered saints across the country. Several leaders, including Akhilesh, make inappropriate comments on Sanatan Dharma, Bhagwan and saints every now and then. All such leaders should desist from this. We warn all such leaders to not drag seers into petty politics, otherwise, they would have to face the anger of Sanatanis.”“According to the Sanatan tradition, chief minister Yogi Adityanath is the Peethadheeshvara (chief) of Gorakhnath Math which is revered all over the world. In India, since ancient times, ‘dharmasatta’ (rule of religion) has always been above the rule of law. By the right given to saints by the Constitution, Yogi Adityanath is the chief minister. Just because of this, no one gets the right to do dirty politics with him,” he added.“Leaders like Akhilesh Yadav and Rahul Gandhi are making petty remarks against ‘Sanatan Dharma’ only because of minority appeasement,” he said.SP’s spokesperson for UP, Manoj Rai Dhoopchandi, however, said that Yadav did not name any person or community in his statement and had used the term generally. “The person who is blowing up the matter out of proportion seemed to be publicity-hungry and wanted his own publicity by connecting his name with the SP chief,” he said.Last month, too, Yadav had stirred up a controversy by equating Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel with Mohammad Ali Jinnah. “Sardar Patel, Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and (Muhammad Ali) Jinnah studied in the same institute and became barristers. They helped (India) get freedom and never backed away from any struggle,” Yadav had said during a rally.The statement triggered sharp reactions from top BJP leaders, with UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath saying: “A national hero Sardar Patel can’t be compared with Jinnah for the sake of vote bank politics,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sant-samiti-seeks-akhilesh-apology-for-chillumjeevi-remark-101637260082670.html
19-11-2021||India||‘Skin-to-skin’ orders on sexual abuse set aside||The Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that touching a child with sexual intent even through clothing is an offence of sexual assault under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, setting aside separate decisions of the Bombay high court passed in January that made skin-to-skin physical contact a necessary condition to hold someone guilty of sexual assault.Underscoring the detrimental effect of allowing such an interpretation, a bench of justices UU Lalit, S Ravindra Bhat and Bela M Trivedi said, “Restricting the interpretation of the words “touch” or “physical contact” to “skin-to-skin contact” would not only be a narrow and pedantic interpretation of the provision contained in Section 7 of the Pocso Act, but it would lead to an absurd interpretation of the said provision.”The court set aside the two orders of the high court – passed on January 15 and 19 – and directed the convicted persons to surrender within four weeks to undergo the remaining sentence of three years and five years awarded to them by a special Pocso court last year.Also read | SC to hear plea against appointment of Rakesh Asthana as Delhi CP next weekSexual assault is defined in section 7 as “whoever, with sexual intent, touches the vagina, penis, anus or breast of the child or makes the child touch the vagina, penis, anus or breast of such person or any other person, or does any other act with sexual intent which involves physical contact without penetration is said to commit sexual assault”. This carries a maximum punishment of five years. Such acts committed on children below 12 years amount to “aggravated sexual assault” that carries a higher punishment of up to seven years.Attorney general KK Venugopal was the first to file an appeal against one of the high court judgments in question. Later, the Maharashtra government, followed by the National Commission for Women (NCW) filed appeals. Even the accused were represented in the case and the court appointed senior advocate Siddharth Dave to assist in the matter as amicus curiae.Through two separate but concurring views, justice Trivedi, writing for herself and justice Lalit, and justice Bhat traced the origin of the words “touch” and “physical contact” and noted that “skin-to-skin” contact was never intended to be incorporated by Parliament while enacting the Pocso Act in 2012.“The very object of enacting the Pocso Act is to protect the children from sexual abuse, and if such a narrow interpretation is accepted, it would lead to a very detrimental situation, frustrating the very object of the Act,” the bench said. It was conscious of the fact that the high court judgment would allow touching the sexual or non-sexual parts of the body of a child with gloves, condoms, sheets or with cloth, though done with sexual intent.“The purpose of the law cannot be to allow the offender to sneak out of the meshes of law,” the court said, holding that the high court committed an error. It said, “The most important ingredient for constituting the offence of sexual assault under Section 7 of the Act is the “sexual intent” and not the “skin-to-skin” contact with the child.”Justice Bhat in his separate but concurring judgment said, “The reasoning in the high court’s judgment quite insensitively trivialises -- indeed legitimises -- an entire range of unacceptable behaviour which undermines a child’s dignity and autonomy, through unwanted intrusions.”Cautioning judges while interpreting provisions of the law, justice Bhat said, “It is no part of any judge’s duty to strain the plain words of a statute, beyond recognition and to the point of its destruction, thereby denying the cry of the times that children desperately need the assurance of a law designed to protect their autonomy and dignity, as Pocso does.”In the two cases before the court, one of the accused, Satish, had touched the breasts of the victim through her clothing and had tried to remove her salwar (pants) when he was caught in the act by the victim’s mother. This incident was of December 2016. The other case was an incident of February 2018 when the accused, Libnus, held the hand of the victim – a five-year old – and unzipped his pants, exposing his penis, while trying to remove the child’s frock. Both were held guilty by the special Pocso court for offences under section 7, 8 and 10 of the Act.The high court said, “The act of pressing of breast of the child aged 12 years, in the absence of any specific details as to whether the top was removed or whether he inserted his hand inside the top and pressed her breast, would not fall in the definition of ‘sexual assault’. It would certainly fall within the definition of the offence under section 354 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).”Section 354 of the IPC is the offence of outraging the modesty of a woman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/skintoskin-orders-on-sexual-abuse-set-aside-101637259962715.html
19-11-2021||India||Heinous home invasion: Months of prep, one lapse||The men have no history of crime, so there was a no match between their fingerprints and the Delhi Police’s database; they had no connection with the family they robbed; they were captured on multiple CCTV cameras near the spot but had their faces were covered (and security guard did not find this unusual in these times of the Covid-19 pandemic); they took a room on rent close to the house they were targeting; and used code names to speak to each other on the phone for well over the month.With these precautions, the five men thought they pulled off a heinous but perfect murder and robbery. But for one small mistake.On Thursday morning, Delhi Police said they solved the murders of two women inside a house in Jangpura Extension, and recovered around ₹90 lakh that five men had robbed in the early hours of Monday.The two women, originally from Darjeeling, were working in the house for the last 5-6 months. Mina Rai (35), was a domestic help, and Sujata Gurung, 40, a nursing attendant. Police said the women were murdered because they spotted the five men during the robbery.The incidentAt 9.10am on Monday, the police control room received information that two women were found dead inside a house in south Delhi’s Jangpura Extension. When a police team reached the house, they saw one of them lying dead on the ground floor with her mouth taped and limbs tied, and the second on the first floor with her face in the ground.The two bodies were first spotted by their employer, Rita Kapoor, when a local dog trainer rang the doorbell and got no response. The man then called Kapoor, after which she went to check on the two women.Also read | Delhi: CCTV footage captured suspects behind Jangpura double murderThe police team took photographs and collected fingerprints from the spot. As part of the investigation, police match fingerprints with all available prints in their database. When the crime is committed by habitual criminals who have been arrested in the past, the prints match, and the cases are solved easily. In this case, however, the sleuths had no such luck.The five men were seen by at least 10 CCTV cameras around the colony, but they were masked, and could not be identified. The colony security guard had told police that saw five men -- their faces masked -- carrying large backpacks, but did not find anything suspicious as this is now normal practice because of Covid guidelines.Monday was also a day when three other women were found murdered across the city, and a parliamentarian, Raju Bista (Lok Sabha MP from Darjeeling) wrote to Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana about the need to solve this case quickly because thousands of migrant women like Mina and Sujata, who come from the hills to the country’s national capital to earn a living, were worried by the murders.The only mistakeAround the same time as the murders, investigators also found CCTV footage of two men on a black Hero Splendor motorcycle near the colony at around the same time as the murders. No resident could identify the two people, or the bike.An investigating officer, who asked not to be named, said: “It was impossible for us to identify the riders of this bike because it was dark. But we figured that the bikers were connected to our case. The CCTV cameras at the gate showed only the three masked suspects leaving the colony on foot. One of the police teams was given the task of identifying these bikers by checking old CCTV camera footage. Our team spotted the same bike outside the crime spot several times on Friday and Saturday. They had been conducting a recce during the day time. This was their mistake. The number plate was clearly visible during the day.”Esha Pandey, deputy commissioner of police(south east) said police had identified the registration number UP 25 DF 6754 and traced the motorcycle to its owner, Sachit Saxena, who works in the marketing department of a private insurance firm.“We arrested Saxena on the basis of technical evidence. Saxena then led us to his accomplices, Prashant Basista, Sachit Saxena, Aniket Jha, Ramesh and Dhananjay Gulia.”Police said Saxena and Basista were planning the robbery for almost a year.“ A woman, who worked at the Jangpura house until two years ago, had told her nephew (Saxena) about large sums of cash that the family kept at home. Saxena worked in the same insurance company as Basista. The two were trying to find three other men for several months to execute this robbery. About two months ago, Basista found three men who agreed to part of the crime,” an investigating officer said.Investigating officers, said the five men hoped they would find about ₹10-20 lakhs inside the house. The two main conspirators Saxena and Basista, had planned to quit their jobs as marketing agents and start a business with the money they would make from the robbery.While police said they recovered ₹90 lakh (including forex) that the five men had robbed, Kapoor’s husband, Iftar Mulk Chisti said the figure quoted by the police is exaggerated. He said he is still checking what items are missing. “Police has asked me to provide details of the missing items. I am in touch with them,” he said.In records of the colony’s directory, Chisti is listed as an architect. DCP Pandey said Iftar and his wife are elderly citizens who were unable to figure out what was stolen from the house. “This is why the robbery was not reported on the day of the incident,” she said.Month of planningSometime in the first week of October, the five men took two rooms on rent in Amar Colony, less than 5km from the house. Police said this was the place where the five men detailed every part of the plan. The five took photographs of the Jangpura house when they could; discussed how many people were present inside at different times of the day, among other details.DCP Pandey in her press statement said that the five men used only voice over internet protocol (VOIP) to speak to each other. This was their way of ensuring that even if one person was arrested, police could not trace the others.“They even had number code names – 1,2,3,4 and 5. They held meetings at the room in Amar Colony to be mentally prepared to murder the family, or other people in the house, if there was resistance. Saxena and Basista would regularly check visit the K block on their Black Splendour,” a second investigating officer said.Police said the five men also researched different ways to rob or murder by watching crime shows on the internet. About a week ago, they agreed to use chloroform to immobilise the victims. They bought the chloroform, duct tape, ropes, masks, hoodies, and cutters from different shops across the city to avoid suspicion. Inside the rented room that served as their hideout, they wore the hoodies and the mask, and then took photographs on their cell phones to check if they could be recognised on camera.“We are now probing the place from where they bought the chloroform. This will be a part of case evidence,” the second investigating officer said.Executing the planAt around 10pm on Sunday, hours before the murder, the five came to K block, Jangpur Extension. Saxena and Basista came on their motorcycle, parked it about 1km away from the house, while the other three took an auto rickshaw. The five men then took different routes to meet at the neighbourhood park where they hid behind the bushes. None of them carried their phones.DCP Pandey said the five men waited for over three hours before making the move at around 1.30am.A third officer, who questioned the five men, said, “They easily scaled the front wall of the house. They were sure that everyone inside was asleep. They had luck on their side. A door at the back of the house was open. There is an elevator in the building, which does not stop on the first and the second floor. They had information that the money was on the first or second floor.”Police said this was the part of the plan that the five had not rehearsed. Unsure of how the elevator worked, or on which floor it would take them, the five were confused and started talking among themselves. Police said the elevator does not stop on the first and the second floor and goes directly to the third floor. Also, during the commotion, they unknowingly woke up domestic help Mina. The five told police on Thursday evening that Mina had tried to raise an alarm so they overpowered her, tied her limbs with a plastic rope, taped her mouth, and used chloroform. Police said she was smothered to death. The five men then proceeded to the first floor, where they found Sujata had woken up after hearing the noises below. They pushed her on the floor, used the chloroform, and smothered her with a pillow.Investigating officers said that the family’s three pet dogs – on the second floor – did not hear what was happening on the ground and the first floors.“Luck was on their side here too. They could not go to the second floor, where they believed the money was hidden. The elevator directly took them to the third floor where the family’s eldest – a woman in her 80s was sleeping. They searched the elderly woman’s almirah and found about ₹90 lakh in cash. Fortunately for her, the elderly woman did not wake up. Even if she had, she could not have raised an alarm as she is suffering from paralysis,” the third officer said.On the second floor, the elderly woman’s son Iftar Mulk and his wife, Rita were sleeping. Their daughter was in Gujarat on the day of the murder.Police officials said that they learnt about the large sum of stolen money only after the arrest of the five men, and are likely to probe why there was so much cash in the house.Realising that they had unknowingly entered the right floor, and got what they wanted, the five men put the money in their bags, took the elevator down, and left the house. They took the hard disk of the CCTV camera inside the house to destroy evidence.Aniket Jha, Ramesh and Dhananjay Gulia walked their way of out of the colony. Saxena and Sasista walked a distance, and then rode the black motorcycle back to their hideout.It was during this final bike ride that a CCTV captured the two suspects, which was what led to their arrest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jangpura-extension-murders-heinous-home-invasion-months-of-prep-one-lapse-101637259902713.html

Four people have been arrested in connection with the incident and sent to judicial custody till November 30, an official said.Later, the police imposed prohibitory orders at three wards of Teliamura Municipal Councils from Thursday till November 24 , a day before the state civic polls going to be conducted. Votes would be counted on November 28.Of the 19 injured persons, nine including five BJP and four AITMC activists were referred to Agartala for better treatment. According to police, three separate cases were filed at the police station with two filed by the Trinamool Congress supporters and another one is suo motto. Police said that the clash started between the two political parties at Kalitilla on Wednesday night following a procession of TMC led by one local leader Anirban Sarkar. Two police personnel sustained injuries while intervening them. The group of TMC leaders led by Anirban was known to have attacked the BJP activists with sharp weapons and they also set fire on the motorbikes owned by some of the BJP activists. The police, later dispersed off the mob by firing gas shells. “ It has become necessary to increase surveillance upon persons with unverified character and antecedents for ensuring peaceful conduct of election of the Local Bodies. There are also some inputs available about involvement of such elements in creating concocted stories to misguide the people to create law & order situation. At present the situation is under control and sharp watch is being maintained, “ a press statement issued by police reads. AITMC leader Sushmita Dev said, “ Our activists were attacked by the BJP cadres and police booked our people due to political influence of the ruling BJP government.

19-11-2021||India||India, China agree to hold fresh military-level talks on LAC row||India and China emerged from the latest round of diplomatic talks on the border standoff in the Ladakh sector on Thursday with little to show but an agreement on holding the next discussions between senior military commanders at an early date.The virtual meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs was held against a backdrop of growing evidence of China building infrastructure and villages in disputed sections of the Line of Actual Control (LAC), and a lack of forward movement on disengagement at friction points such as Hot Springs and Depsang.The external affairs ministry said in a statement after the WMCC meeting: “It was agreed that both sides should hold the next (14th) round of the senior commanders meeting at an early date to achieve the objective of complete disengagement from all the friction points along the LAC in the Western Sector in accordance with the existing bilateral agreements and protocols.”A readout from China’s foreign ministry said the two sides agreed to maintain dialogue through diplomatic and military channels, and “actively prepare for the 14th round of military commander-level talks, and make efforts to resolve the remaining issues” in the western sector.Both sides described the discussions at the WMCC meeting as “candid and in-depth”.The last round of talks between the senior military commanders, which was held at the Chushul-Moldo border meeting point on October 10, failed to make any substantive progress as Beijing contended that New Delhi had made “unreasonable and unrealistic demands”.The Chinese readout also said the two sides will “continue to work hard to further ease the border situation and strive to shift from emergency response to normalised control as soon as possible”. The shift from “emergency response” to “normalised control” was a repeat of what Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi told his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar during a meeting in Dushanbe in September.The Indian statement said the two sides recalled the agreement between Jaishankar and Wang during their meeting in Dushanbe that military and diplomatic officials should continue discussions to resolve remaining issues along the LAC.They also reviewed developments since the meeting of the military commanders on October 10, and “agreed on the need to find an early resolution to the remaining issues” in eastern Ladakh while fully abiding by bilateral agreements and protocols to restore peace and tranquillity, the Indian statement said.The two sides also agreed that they would continue to “ensure a stable ground situation” and avoid any untoward incident, the Indian statement added.The Chinese readout said the two sides agreed to consolidate the existing disengagement results, strictly abide by agreements and consensus, and avoid recurrences in the current situation.The Indian side at the WMCC meeting was led by additional secretary (East Asia) Naveen Srivastava of the external affairs ministry, while the Chinese delegation was headed by Hong Liang, director of the boundary and oceanic department of the foreign ministry.India and China withdrew frontline troops from the north and south banks of Pangong Lake in February and from Gogra in August after several rounds of diplomatic and military talks, but there has been no further movement on disengagement and de-escalation since then. The two sides have been locked in the military standoff for more than 18 months, sending bilateral ties plummeting to their worst in decades.The Indian side has insisted relations can be normalised only when disengagement is completed at other friction points such as Hot Springs and Depsang. On the other hand, China has pushed for delinking the standoff from the overall bilateral relationship and greater contacts in areas such as trade and investment.Sameer Patil fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said the outcome of the WMCC meeting showed both sides were sticking to their respective stated positions and this is yielding no solution.“In light of recent revelations about China’s activities in other sections of the border, this would mean that China won’t budge from its position. Clearly, there is no incentive for both sides to compromise. This stalemate will continue for some time to come,” Patil said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-agree-to-hold-fresh-military-level-talks-on-lac-row-101637259665563.html
19-11-2021||India||Modi urges bankers to be ‘partners in growth’||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday urged bankers to shun their age-old “approver-applicant” attitude, make customers their partners in progress, proactively reach out to small entrepreneurs, and help in the country’s inclusive economic development.Addressing a conference on “Creating Synergies for Seamless Credit Flow and Economic Growth”, organised by the Union finance ministry in the Capital, the PM said the Indian banking sector was robust due to several reforms undertaken in the last six-seven years, but bankers need to become proactive, and approach people who need funds instead of waiting for customers to visit them.“You must shun the feeling that you are an approver and the person in front of you is an applicant, and banks must adopt the partnership model,” Modi said.Recalling an experience from his school days, when banks were not nationalised, he said that private bankers would visit his school a couple of times every year to explain the importance of opening a bank account to children. Why should branches of public sector banks not approach at least 10 local micro, small and medium enterprises in their vicinity offering financial help and advice, Modi asked.“This is the time when banks should act as wealth creators and job creators, which will help in enhancing the country’s balance sheet,” he said.He also gave the example of the production-linked initiative (PLI) scheme where the government gives incentives to Indian manufacturers for scaling up their production capacity to compete with global firms.“Banks can play a big role in making projects viable through their support and expertise,” said Modi. The government has launched a ₹1.97 lakh crore PLI scheme for 13 sectors, including pharmaceuticals, telecom, speciality steel, white goods and solar modules.Listing some of the key financial reforms taken by the government, Modi underscored that government schools have helped provide immediate relief to millions of poor people though instant transfer of money in their Jan Dhan accounts. According tothe finance ministry, over 438 million beneficiaries have banked through Jan Dhan accounts, started in 2014, and these accounts have a combined balance of ₹1.48 lakh crore.“The initiative paid dividends during the pandemic as it ensured that no poor person is left hungry,” he said.The Covid-19 pandemic led to a 68-day hard nationwide lockdown starting in March 2020. During this period, the government released free food grains and financial assistance to about 315 million beneficiaries, according to official data. The financial assistance went directly to the Jan Dhan accounts of the beneficiaries.Modi stressed that financial inclusion has direct impact on society as it unlocks the productive potential of citizens, and said states where more Jan Dhan accounts are opened have found that crime rates have reduced. “Whether it is a public sector or private sector bank, the more we invest in citizens the more jobs we will create,” he said.Other steps taken have created a strong capital base, he said, adding that now banks have sufficient liquidity, and non-performing assets (NPAs) in public sector banks are at the lowest in the last five years.The government reforms not only unearthed hidden NPAs but also recovered about ₹5 lakh crore from wilful defaulters, and stressed assets worth another ₹2 lakh crore will be resolved through recently created National Asset Reconstruction Company Ltd (NARCL), Modi said.The company, also called a “bad bank”, will aggregate and consolidate stressed assets for their subsequent resolution. The Union government in September 2021 gave a guarantee of ₹30,600 crore to back security receipts issued by NARCL.Modi said the government has strengthened banks by recapitalising them and transparently resolving their NPA issues that included transformative legislation -- the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). “Today, Indian banks have become so strong that they are capable of energising the economy of the country, to give it a big push. They can play a big role in making India self-reliant,” he said.After a transparent Asset Quality Review (AQR), undertaken in 2015, gross NPAs of public sector banks (PSBs) soared from ₹2,16,739 crore on March 31, 2014, to ₹8,95,601 crore on March 31, 2018, according to government data. But the “4 R” approach – recognition, resolution, recapitalisation and reforms – from 2016, brought this down to ₹6,16,616 crore on March 31, 2021.Modi underscored the importance of using data to enhance business and improve services. He gave the example of Goods and Services Tax (GST) data that capture financial history of an entrepreneur, which banks should leverage to proactively reach out to scrupulous businessmen who may need funds to further expand their businesses.Modi said the government’s “Atmanirbhar Bharat” [Self-reliant India] initiative has opened “doors of new opportunities” giving amazing growth opportunities to corporate and start-ups. “Friends, there is no other better time to fund and invest in India’s aspiration -- and our banking sector must understand – this is the time to invest in ideas... this is the time to support start-ups,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-urges-bankers-to-be-partners-in-growth-101637259603931.html
19-11-2021||India||SC rejects plea by Deshmukh seeking probe report in money laundering case||The Supreme Court on Thursday dismissed a petition filed by former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh, seeking a direction to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to produce its inquiry reports relating to the corruption case filed against him. “Should we entertain this petition just because this person has been a minister? There has to be something extraordinary warranting an interference by this court in an ongoing investigation,” the bench, led by justice Kaul, told senior advocate Kapil Sibal, who appeared for Deshmukh.Sibal argued that Deshmukh’s only remedy was before the apex court since CBI in April informed the bench that the preliminary investigation has disclosed commission of serious offences against Deshmukh in the corruption case. The senior counsel referred to recent media reports that claimed a clean chit to Deskhmukh in this case. The bench, however, asked Sibal if media reports alone could be relied upon by the court to entertain a petition. It dismissed Deshmukh’s petition, asking him to approach a court of competent jurisdiction.During the hearing, Sibal also complained that the court, while refusing to entertain Deshmukh’s petition against CBI’s preliminary investigation in April, cited former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh’s allegations but the senior police officer was now absconding.“It is unfortunate that people occupying important positions show no confidence in the system,” retorted the bench.Deshmukh has been in jail since November 2 after he was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED), almost six months after the agency first registered a case against him for obtaining illegal gratification from bar owners in Mumbai when the minister was in office.In his petition before the Supreme Court, Deshmukh also asked for constitution of a special investigation team (SIT) for a “fair and independent” probe into corruption and bribery charges against him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-rejects-plea-by-deshmukh-seeking-probe-report-in-money-laundering-case-101637259603335.html

These rath yatras by the party’s top leaders could culminate with a massive rally in Lucknow to be addressed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi-- a plan similar to the model BJP followed ahead of the 2017 UP assembly polls. The yatras could be named Vijay Sankalp Yatras, party leaders said.Rajnath Singh has been named in-charge of Awadh and Kashi region that includes the Varanasi Lok Sabha constituency represented by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Shah has been named in-charge for Braj-Paschim region. Nadda will oversee the Gorakhpur-Kanpur region.Also read | No pre-poll alliance, will contest on all 403 seats in UP election, says Priyanka Gandhi“The party’s top leaders will interact with booth presidents and booth level workers,” party leaders said.Nadda is expected in Uttar Pradesh for a couple of days from November 22 to fine tune the party’s strategy.The BJP chief will also address a booth presidents’ conference in Gorakhpur on November 22 and in Kanpur on November 23 while Rajnath will address booth presidents’ conferences in Jaunpur and in Sitapur on November 25. Shah will address similar conferences in Braj and Paschim (western UP) though the dates of his interaction have not been announced so far. BJP has also named an election panel for the state headed by Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan.“There is also a plan to get our top leaders to contest UP polls. The possibility of chief minister Yogi Adityanath, deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya and other leaders, who are currently MLCs, contesting is high,” BJP leaders said. The BJP has already completed verification of committees up to the booth level.

19-11-2021||India||Centre asks UTs, states to resume mid-day meals||The Centre has asked all the states and union territories (UTs) to resume the provision of cooked hot meals to eligible children attending schools under the government’s flagship Pradhan Mantri Poshan Shakti Nirman (PM POSHAN) scheme while strictly adhering to the Covid-19 guidelines.When the schools were closed in March 2020, following the implementation of a nationwide lockdown, the erstwhile mid-day meal scheme was disrupted. The Centre had advised all the states and UTs to provide food security allowance to all eligible students to meet their nutritional requirements. Over the last one and half years, states have either transferred allowance or distributed dry ration among eligible students.In a letter sent to all the states and UTs on Wednesday, the ministry of education’s department of school education and literacy said, “With the improvement of (covid-19) situation, many states and UTs are progressively reopening schools. It is advised to resume provision of hot cooked meals to eligible students attending schools by adhering to the prevalent covid appropriate protocols and social distancing norms as prescribed by the competent authority.”The states and UTs have been asked to take immediate appropriate action and send a plan to the ministry by November 22. “Timely action at your end will go a long way in providing much-needed nutrition through hot cooked meals to the children,” the letter added.Under the recently rechristened PM-POSHAN scheme, 118 million students enrolled in classes 1-8 across 1.1 million schools will be benefitted. The scheme now also covers pre-primary students. While students enrolled in primary classes (1-5) are entitled to 100 food gram grains per working day under the scheme, those in upper primary classes (6-8) get 150-gram food grains to ensure a minimum of 700 calories. The new scheme now also has a provision for supplementary nutrition for children in aspirational districts and those with a high prevalence of anaemia. According to the SoPs shared by the ministry with the states, the cook-cum help workers will be wearing masks during cleaning, washing, cutting, cooking and serving of meals. They would not be allowed to wear nail polish, watches, rings, jewellery and bangles during cooking and serving the food to avoid the possibility of “danger of contamination of the product.”“The kitchen cum store/place of cooking must be deep cleaned and sanitized before 24 hours of actual cooking after reopening of schools…Cleaning accessories such as clothes, mops and brushes carry a very high risk of cross-contamination. They must therefore be thoroughly washed, cleaned and dried after use,” the SoPs stated.The SoPs further stated that serving and dining areas should also be well sanitized before and after food consumption and students should either be served mid-day meals in a staggered manner or their classes. “The school children should also wear face cloth/ masks while the food is being served and at all times in the dining area except while eating/drinking...Hand wash with soap for a minimum of 40 seconds before and after eating MDM should be vigorously promoted,” it added.Besides, states have been asked to ensure schools have a continuous drinking water supply and proper waste disposal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-asks-uts-states-to-resume-mid-day-meals-101637258163300.html
19-11-2021||India||Supreme Court asks IIT to assist Dalit teen who cracked test||Observing that a meritorious Dalit boy can be a leader of the nation in future, the Supreme Court on Thursday asked the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) management to make its best endeavour to accommodate a 17-year-old candidate who lost a seat at IIT-Bombay for failing to make online fee payment in time because of a technical glitch. “It is an unfortunate case...He is a Dalit boy. He has aspirations and he is meritorious. For all you know, he could be a leader of the nation 10 years or 20 years down the line,” a bench, headed by justice Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, told the counsel appearing for IIT-Bombay and the IIT’s seat allocation authority.The bench, which included justice AS Bopanna, took note that the candidate, Prince Jaibir Singh, who secured the 864th rank in the scheduled caste category and was being allotted a seat at the prestigious IIT- Bombay for a BTech course in civil engineering, would not forego the opportunity had it not been for some difficulties in arranging the acceptance fees.Singh, who is from Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh, submitted that although he completed all other formalities on the Joint Seat Allocation Authority ( JoSAA) portal on October 29, he could not make the payment of the seat acceptance fees as he was falling short of money. After his sister transferred the money into his account on October 30, he made several attempts to make the payment online but failed to do so till 12 noon on October 31, which was the deadline, due to technical errors. Referring to the sequence of events from the petition, the bench remarked: “Who would want to forsake an IIT-Bombay seat? Ultimately, these are problems of resources. We can show him the door on five different grounds in law, like what the high court has done, but let us look at this as a humane problem...beyond legal intricacies,” the bench said, asking IIT’s advocate Sonal Jain to act as an officer of the court to look out for a seat for Singh and come back on Monday. The court told Jain that it is mindful of the apprehension of the IIT management that there could be a deluge of similar requests and petitions if they agree to Singh’s admission. “Don’t worry. we will protect you. We will say that we are exercising our powers under Article 142 of the Constitution (authority to issue orders to do complete justice) and that this order cannot be used as a precedent in any other case,” added the bench.As Jain pointed out that all the seats in IIT-Bombay, including those under the reserved quotas, had been filled up, the bench responded: “This is a case where we have to look beyond the law. If it is his destiny, we cannot do anything but let us all try our best. You be the officer of the court and do something.”Representing Singh, advocate Amol Chitale submitted that Singh is willing to accept a seat in any of the seven zonal IITs, in any stream, and is not pressing for a seat only at IIT-Bombay. Taking note of this, the bench asked Jain to find out if Singh could be accommodated in any of the seven IITs across the country. “Tell us where seats are available and if he can get a place somewhere. He is meritorious, after all,” it said.Singh initially moved the Bombay high court, contending that he secured an all-India rank of 25,894 and scheduled caste rank of 864 in the JEE Advanced and was allotted the seat. He said after failing to clear the seat acceptance fees by the deadline, he went to the authorities concerned on November 1, and requested them to allow him to make the payment. But IIT officials expressed their inability to help him. While Singh urged the court to direct authorities to accept the fees and process his admission, the high court on November 12 declined to give him any relief. The high court held that Singh “has entailed the consequence of rejection” because he failed to register his grievances before the deadline. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-asks-iit-to-assist-dalit-teen-who-cracked-test-101637257803475.html
19-11-2021||India||Pockets of rising infections emerge even as Covid-19 wave ebbs across India||In the week ended November 17, India reported 10,978 new cases of Covid-19 every day on average. This is the lowest that the seven-day average (a number that denotes a region’s Covid curve) has dropped to since the week ended June 14, 2020 – a time when the first wave of the pandemic was just kicking off in the country.Currently, at the national level, Covid-19 cases continue to decrease, a trend that has largely sustained since the peak of the second wave on May 9, when the daily cases averaged 391,819. However, the rate of decline (of the 7-day average of daily cases) has come down this month; it was 1.3% up to November 17 compared to 1.9% in October. This is because some states and districts have started to exhibit a slight bump in daily cases after the festive season that started last month. While this increase in infections remains small as of now, it reinforces the need for continuing with pandemic-appropriate behaviour and completing adult vaccinations, particularly where local figures are not as satisfactory as at the national level.Cases have increased significantly in West Bengal and Assam in the past monthDussehra was celebrated in the country on October 15. The seven-day average of daily cases has increased in 11 of 29 states (including Delhi) in the month-long period between October 15 and November 15. However, this is less a reason for alarm than caution. Of these 11 states, only two – Assam and West Bengal – were reporting more than 100 cases a day on October 15. The 7-day average of daily cases has increased by 10.8% in Assam (from 208 on October 15 to 231 on November 15) and by 26.2% in West Bengal (from 666 on October 15 to 841 on November 15). In the same interval, the remaining nine states have registered a growth higher than West Bengal’s growth of 26.2%, but the 7-day average was still below 50 in all of them on November 15.Cases have also increased in a few districts of states with declining cases As is to be expected, in most of India’s districts, cases have declined. Of the 707 districts (Delhi’s districts merged as one) for which data is compiled by How India Lives, the seven-day average of daily cases has decreased between October 15 and November 15 in 222 districts. In another 379 districts, of which 317 reported no cases in the week ending October 15, the average has not changed.Only 106 districts have registered an increase in the 7-day average of daily cases in the past month. Even among these, only 26 reported an average of 10 or more cases a day in the week ending October 15. Of these 26 districts, 10 are in West Bengal alone and two in Assam, states where cases have increased from a base of relatively higher caseload. 12 of the 26 districts are, however, located in states where cases have decreased in the past month, suggesting the bump may be localised (for now at least). Of these 12 districts, six are in Maharashtra, three in Telangana, and one each in Tamil Nadu, Odisha, and Mizoram.How much have cases increased in districts?Among districts that have registered an increase in the 7-day average of daily cases in past one month, five had 100 or more cases a day in the week ending October 15. From October 15 to November 15, Kolkata (44%) and Mumbai (37%) have registered the biggest increase among them.Also read | Covid-19: 50% of MP's eligible population fully vaccinated, says health ministerIn other districts, the percentage increase might be higher but that is the result of their low caseload earlier. For example, Kamrup Metropolitan (the district where Guwahati is located) has registered a 292% increase in the past month. But in absolute numbers, the increase is from 25 cases to 98 cases a day. Aurangabad in Maharashtra (22 cases to 38 cases a day) and Srinagar in Jammu and Kashmir (35 cases to 56 cases a day) are other districts with a big percentage growth among districts that saw 20-100 cases a day. Although this growth is modest in absolute numbers and can be easily contained, it does emphasise the need for continuing with pandemic-appropriate behaviour such as wearing masks in public places and avoiding crowded spaces. In 2/3rd districts, less than half of all adults are fully vaccinatedIsolated districts reporting an increase in cases also emphasises the need for enhancing vaccine coverage. Although over 80% of adults in India have now received at least one dose of the vaccine, 44% of the country’s districts (274 of 628 districts of 2011 census with Delhi and Mumbai districts merged into one) were below this threshold on November 17. In 18 districts (eight of them in Nagaland, seven in Arunachal, Manipur and Meghalaya, and one each in Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, and Tamil Nadu), the first dose coverage is under 50%.Just one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine also offers less protection from the infection than complete vaccination. At the national level, the share of fully vaccinated adults went past the share of partially vaccinated for the first time on November 16. As of November 17, this was yet to happen in 316 of the 628 districts. While over 40% of adults in the country have been fully vaccinated, at the district level, this threshold has not been reached in almost half (305 of 628 districts) of the districts in the country.

Congress spokesperson Gourav Vallabh said the difference between Hinduism and Hindutva is the same as that between Mahatma Gandhi and Nathuram Godse, as the former preached Hindu religion and spread harmony and non-violence, PTI reported.The recent book of Salman Khurshid on the Supreme Court's Ayodhya verdict has stirred controversy as the writer has been accused of equating Hindustva with ISID and Boko Haram. "Sanatan Dharma and classical Hinduism known to sages and saints were being pushed aside by a robust version of Hindutva, by all standards a political version similar to the jihadist Islam of groups like ISIS and Boko Haram of recent years," a chapter of the book titled 'The Saffron Sky' reads. While senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad disagreed with the writer, many Congress leaders sought to clarify the difference between Hindutva and Hinduism. Congress leader Manish Tewari recently tweeted that religion is a private identity which shoud not be used in politics. "... I believe in Nehruvian ideal that religion is a private space activity. Everyone has the right to practice, profess and propagate their religion in their private lives. In public domain, there should be a strict separation of the Church and State. I am a Hindu, I worship my God but that is not my politics," Tewari tweeted.Congress spokesperson Gourav Vallabh explained that Hindutva is what Mahatma Gandhi preached. "In the last 200 years, who is the greatest practising Hindu in our country -- Mahatma Gandhi Ji. What Mahatma Gandhi Ji preached and gave is called as Hindu Dharma and what Nathuram Godse practised is called Hindutva. It is as simple as this," he said."Godse did not understand what the Rig Veda says and he only understood exclusiveness, while Gandhi's Hindu religion understood inclusiveness. Godse's Hindu religion is Hindutva and that does not understand those who talk of respect for all religions and Vaudhaiva Kutumbakam and that is why he shot and killed him," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/godse-preached-hindutva-says-congress-amid-row-over-salman-khurshid-s-book-101637252699482.html
19-11-2021||India||Bodies of 2 civilians killed in Hyderpora encounter exhumed amid stir||The Jammu and Kashmir administration late on Thursday exhumed the bodies of the two civilians killed in Monday’s gunfight in Srinagar and was set to hand them over to their families amid protests in the Valley, the Srinagar mayor said.Businessmen Altaf Ahmad Bhat and Mudasir Gul were killed along with two terrorists in the encounter in the Hyderpora area of Srinagar. Police maintained that the two men were “overground workers” of terror outfits and were killed in the crossfire but their families said that the two were used as human shields and called the killings “cold-blood murders”. Police buried Bhat and Gul in Handwara, around 70km from Hyderpora, without their families being present, citing “law and order concerns”. Earlier in the day, the J&K administration also ordered a magisterial probe into the encounter.The families of the two civilians staged a sit-in at the Press Enclave in Srinagar on Wednesday and held a candle-light vigil after the day-long protest, demanding that the bodies of the two men be handed to them. They were forcibly removed from the site by police around midnight and a few of them were detained briefly.Also read | Omar Abdullah stages protest against Hyderpora killings, calls off after families inform of assurance to return bodies“Have been informed that the bodies of Altaf Ahmed and Mudasir Gul have been exhumed at Handwara for last rites and burial by families. This is the first step towards ensuring justice is done in this case,” Srinagar mayor Junaid Mattu tweeted.Speaking on condition of anonymity, a relative of Gul said: “We met the officials regarding the return of body and they sought some assurances from us, which we readily gave. We believe the bodies will reach us.”National Conference leader and former chief minister Omar Abdullah on Thursday staged a sit-in demanding the return of bodies of the two men.“We are sitting here peacefully. If we wanted, we would have blocked roads, bridges, but no. There has been no sloganeering, no law and order disturbance and no road has been blocked. We are not raising a voice against the government, we just demand that the bodies be returned,” he said.Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chief and former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti accused the Centre of being “inhuman” and said she was put under house arrest again.“Again under house arrest and PDP’s Najmu Saqib and Suhail Bukhari too have been arrested. The pattern of using innocent civilians as human shields and then denying their families the right to a decent burial shows that GOI has plumbed new depths of inhumanity,” she said in a tweet.Earlier in the day, J&K lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha’s office said an additional district magistrate will probe the Hyderpora encounter while promising suitable action as soon as a report is submitted. It added the administration is committed to protecting the lives of civilians and will ensure there is no injustice.“A magisterial inquiry by an officer of ADM rank has been ordered in Hyderpora encounter.Govt will take suitable action as soon as the report is submitted in a time-bound manner. JK admin reiterates commitment of protecting lives of innocent civilians &it will ensure there is no injustice,” Sinha’s office tweeted.Welcoming the administration’s move, Bhat’s brother Abdul Majeed said the family also wanted that the killers of his sibling be brought to justice.“I am thankful to the L-G for ordering an inquiry. I am thankful that my oppressed voice was heard by someone. I only have one request to the L-G, I want the body of my brother returned to us and the killers of my innocent brother brought to justice,” Majeed said.A relative of Gul , who did not wish to be named, said that they appreciate the LG administration’s decision, but want the case to reach its logical conclusion.“The call of inquiry is a momentary relief and we appreciate it but we will wait for its outcome. We are simply asking for justice because we know our son was innocent. We also seek the body of our son back and we hope that the demand will also be granted,” he said.J&K DGP Dilbag Singh said the “police is open to correction if anything has gone wrong”. “We will look into the demands of the families. We are open to corrections if anything has gone wrong. A police probe will also find out what went wrong.We will find out what happened in the Hyderpora encounter. We are for the safety of people and will not shy away from a probe,” Singh was quoted as saying by news agency CNS.BJP spokesperson for J&K unit, Altaf Thakur, welcomed the order, saying: “We welcome the magisterial inquiry into the incident. If families had any doubt those doubts should be cleared and an inquiry is welcome in that direction. Civilian killings won’t be tolerated at any cost.

19-11-2021||Today's||Solving the problem of missing women entrepreneurs||In India, women comprise 49% of the total population. The Gender Parity Index (GPI) for enrolment in higher education for 2019-20 was at 1.01% compared to 1.0% in 2018-19, indicating that more women are attending higher education in the country. Yet, their presence in the world of work is highly skewed, especially as entrepreneurs. Women own only 13.76% of the enterprises and are founders of 6% of the Indian startups. Startups with at least one women co-founder raised only 5% of the total funding raised by startups between 2018-2020, and this further shrunk to only 1.43% of the total investor funding in the startup ecosystem, when only women founders were considered. In India, with the exception of Nykaa, led by Falguni Nair, no women feature in the unicorn and soonicorn list. Across the world, only 20 startups were founded by women that initiated an initial public offering (IPO) and are currently traded. The reason for such lacklustre numbers of women entrepreneurs can either be that women are not competent or interested in running businesses, or there are systemic reasons for the sparse presence of women in business. A substantial amount of research has focused on the woman founder as the focal point to explain the gender gap. The reasons for fewer women entrepreneurs or leaders have often focused on what women lack. It has been said that while entrepreneurs are expected to be risk-taking, confident, and competitive, women are assumed to lack risk-taking appetite, communicate long-term vision and scalability, and commitment to making their startup big. Entrepreneurship is normatively viewed as men’s work, and thus, women as founders of businesses are seen as counter stereotypical. This is, of course, a deeply flawed view. First, most personality traits are distributed fairly equally among men and women. Second, when women try to overcome the “deficit”, they are punished by society for trying too hard. For example, women who make their pitches with passion are seen to be emotional, and thus, not suited for running a business. Similarly, women who are competent are perceived as cold and self-serving, and thus, as potentially incapable of building a team.An alternative line of enquiry and work that is being pursued is exploring the biases exhibited by investors in their funding decisions. Good looking young men have the best chance to be funded and not so good-looking older women have the least. When men use complex abstract language, it is viewed positively by investors; however, when women use abstract language they are seen as not suitable for the practical world. On top of it, when women founders make clear concrete pitches, it is often seen as lacking in a vision for growth. Investors have been found to ask different types of questions to men vs women. Men making pitches are asked promotive (signifying presence and possibilities) questions and women making pitches are asked preventive (signifying absence and avoidance) questions. A majority of investor groups are comprised of and are led by, men, and investment committees are mostly male-dominated. Only three of the top 20 venture capital firms in Indian have one woman partner. The rest do not have a single woman partner. Additionally, only 2% of the angel investors are women. In male-only or male-dominated investor groups, homophily (a tendency for us to like people who are like us), a fundamental bias among humans, possibly impacts decision-making. To overcome such unconscious biases, one of the suggestions is that at least one or more women investors be included in the investment group. This recommendation comes out of the belief that when there is a diversity of gender in the decision-making group, there is a likelihood that women seekers of funds will get a fairer hearing and possibly receive more favourable decisions. Theoretically, adding more women should change the team dynamics and possibly serve to break the spiral of gender role expectations in determining outcomes. However, the inclusion of one or two women rarely works because majority group members biases percolate through the group and provide momentum to the “flywheel” of self-reinforcing beliefs. The individual mindsets of majority investors and imbibed widespread stereotypes of the women entrepreneurs further multiply into a group phenomenon and perpetuate deeply embedded gender biases. Thus, even when there are women in the investor group, the stereotype would perpetuate, ultimately impeding women entrepreneurs’ access to capital. Both men and women investors need to be made aware of their biases, albeit unconscious, towards who is an entrepreneur, how they stereotype women versus men entrepreneurs, how their biases impact objective decision-making, how they treat the same behaviour coming from a woman versus a man and so on. While biases can never be eliminated, it has been shown that when we are exposed to them, we are less likely to let them influence our decisions. Based on our current research, we believe that having more than a token woman is necessary for making an impact on the group dynamics that propel groups to make biased decisions. Having at least half the group comprised of confident women, well-versed with business and financial deals, who are also made aware of their biases, would possibly give women entrepreneurs an equal chance to be funded. In the long run, we also need more women to join investor companies, and we need more of them to start investment companies.Prof. (Dr.) Neharika Vohra is vice-chancellor, DSEU and professor, IIMA.

19-11-2021||Today's||We are failing our children||This was the week that my household of primary school-going children in New Delhi was waiting for; 21 long months after they closed, schools were finally re-opening. India has the dubious distinction of one of the longest pandemic-induced school closures across the globe. After foot-dragging for months, several states, including Delhi, finally authorised reopening primary schools in November.
19-11-2021||Today's||When Xi Jinping uses history for the future||The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has just published a new resolution on its historical achievements and experiences. The fact that this is just the third history resolution in 100 years of the party’s existence underscores its significance. The first history resolution in 1945 established Mao Zedong’s unquestionable leadership. The second one, under Deng Xiaoping in 1981, addressed Mao’s failings and provided the impetus for China’s economic reform. The 2021 resolution was adopted at the sixth plenary session of the 19th central committee. For a document meant to be about history, the text is overwhelmingly dedicated to Xi Jinping’s rule and the party’s future direction. But then, in politics, history is rarely about the past. Pieces in the party-State media and Xi Jinping’s explanatory note, which was published along with the resolution, confirm this.

Stubble burning makes it worse||The latest instalment of the hand-wringing over Delhi’s bad air problem in various quarters is yet another demonstration of our fascination with technology, our indifference to science, and our misinterpretation of radical and decisive action as the perfect solution (when, in truth, it may not even be a good one).

And that’s an important distinction to make because actual and physical delivery will trigger an American legal instrument that seeks to punish Russia by scaring away its military hardware clients, such as India, with the threat of secondary sanctions.

In Glasgow, India went way beyond what its historic responsibility in contributing to the climate crisis would have entailed — because it could see that the climate crisis is real, its consequences are devastating, the future economic paradigm had to be based on a low-emission trajectory, and every country had to do more than its share to fight it.
