Deshmukh, 71, was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate after a 12-hour on Monday interrogation by officials. On Thursday, Deshmukh was was taken to JJ Hospital for a routine check up on Thursday. “He (Deshmukh) was brought to the hospital for routine check up at 12.30pm and was taken back to ED office by 1pm,” said Sanjay Surwase, superintendent at JJ Hospital. Deshmukh, who appeared before ED for the first time on Monday after skipping multiple summons for the last four months, was arrested in the early hours of Tuesday in connection with the alleged ₹100-crore extortion and money laundering case. ED filed a case against Deshmukh and others after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) booked him in a corruption case related to allegations made by former Mumbai Police commissioner Singh, according to whom Deshmukh got police officers to extort over ₹100 crore a month from bars and restaurants in Mumbai.ED claims that the money was sent to Delhi-based Jain brothers who reportedly operated paper (bogus) companies using hawala channels. The Jain brothers reportedly diverted this money as donations to Nagpur-based Shri Sai Shikshan Sansthan, a trust controlled by the Deshmukh family. ED suspects that the Jain brothers were acting on the instructions of Deshmukh’s son, Hrishikesh. Deshmukh was arrested under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). He has been remanded to ED custody till November 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/money-laundering-case-ed-summons-anil-deshmukh-s-son-101636049708333.html

In the last two months alone, nine people including a 68-year-old woman and a four-year-old child have sustained injuries after the leopard charged at them. These were the first instances of human-leopard conflict in the region since 2017.As per human-leopard conflict management guidelines given by the Union environment ministry, the additional principal chief conservator of forests (APCCF) Maharashtra, will head a committee of experts, veterinarians and forest department officials to decide the fate of the animal after an examination of the animal, and assessing the risks associated with reintroducing it into the Aarey forest. Despite installing multiple camera traps and creating emergency response teams the leopard (officially known as C32) had eluded officials. A sub-adult female leopard aged between one-and-a-half and two years was previously captured in the early hours of October 1, but was identified to be a different animal than the female behind the recent attacks. The forest department trapped another sub-adult female leopard in a cage near Mumbai’s Aarey Colony’s dairy unit number 13 on October 15, but once again it turned out to be a different leopard.Gajendra Hire, deputy conservator of forests (Thane), who coordinated the response between experts, the forest department, citizens and volunteer organisations said, “Translocation and keeping the animal in captivity are both possible options. The animal is currently being held at Sanjay Gandhi National Park. At present it won’t be possible to comment on further course of action until a committee is formed to deliberate on the matter. “||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/forest-department-to-form-committee-to-decide-on-fate-of-captured-leopard-101636046047903.html

However, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has demanded to allow the rituals to be carried out at beaches and seashores.The civic body has also asked the police to ensure that there is no crowding at beaches.The circular issued by the BMC states, “Keeping in mind the crowding during Chhath Puja, a mass celebration of Chhath Pooja at seashores should be avoided and the police must ensure that there is low crowding. Organisations that are asking for permissions at the ward level should construct artificial ponds at their own cost and even fill up the ponds after Chhath Puja is over. This will be the responsibility of the organisation applying for the permission.”Further, the BMC has said that there should only be 50% capacity or a maximum of 200 persons for the celebration in open areas and only 100 persons or 50% of the capacity in closed venues. The BMC has also asked organisers to thermal screen all devotees before they are allowed to take part in the celebrations.Meanwhile, BJP corporator Vinod Mishra said, “We have already taken up the issue with the BMC and demanded that they allow puja at beaches. They have also deployed the police to ensure there is no crowding. The BMC must facilitate the celebrations.”Mishra added, “Also, the BMC must create artificial ponds to avoid crowding and not put the responsibility on the organisers. This is unfair as in other festivals, celebration at the beach was allowed in a limited manner and similarly, even the Chhath Pooja should be allowed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/guidelines-for-chhath-puja-out-bjp-demands-allowing-celebrations-at-beaches-101636044187942.html
04-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi chokes for breath as cracker ban goes for toss in Diwali||Skies over Delhi hung heavy with smoke and its air quality inched towards “severe” category on Diwali night as people burst firecrackers in a blatant disregard to the government’s ban against it.The situation was aggravated further as the festivities were coincided with seasonal farm fires, fumes from which invade the national capital around winter.People from several parts of the city and its suburbs complained of itchy throat and watery eyes, as a layer of smog, the first episode this season, enveloped the environment, news agency PTI reported.Residents of Lajpat Nagar in south Delhi, Burari in north Delhi, Paschim Vihar in west Delhi and Shahdara in east Delhi reported incidents of firecracker bursting as early as 7pm, despite the blanket ban in the national capital till January 1, 2022.ALSO READ | Delhi's air quality remains 'very poor' amid concerns over a worsening crisisSeveral incidents of bursting of high-intensity crackers were reported from Gurugram and Faridabad.The Haryana government had also imposed a ban on Sunday on the sale or use of all kinds of firecrackers in 14 of its districts in the National Capital Region, while curbs were put in other parts.Experts predicted the air quality here may plunge to the severe category by midnight owing to unfavorable meteorological conditions — calm winds, low temperature and low mixing height — and a poisonous cocktail of emissions from firecrackers, stubble burning and local sources.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the “first episode of fog” in the capital reduced visibility at the Indira Gandhi International Airport and the Safdarjung Airport to the range of 600-800 metres in the morning.“It continued to remain in the poor range of 800-900 meters in smog throughout the day due to calm wind conditions,” senior IMD scientist R K Jenamani was quoted as saying by PTI.The first episode of smog coincided with the share of farm fires in Delhi's pollution increasing to the season's highest at 25%.“The PM2.5 pollution in the national capital may enter the ‘severe’ zone by midnight even if there is only 50% of firecrackers emission as compared to last year,” said Gufran Beig, the founder-project director of SAFAR.ALSO READ | Don’t link crackers with religion: Delhi environment minister Gopal RaiThe PM2.5 pollution will shoot up rapidly by Friday early morning with the AQI even crossing the 500 mark, he said.According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the 24-hour average PM2.5 concentration in Delhi-NCR stood at 243 micrograms per cubic meter at 6 pm, more than four times the safe limit of 60 micrograms per cubic meter.The national capital's 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) stood at 382 on Thursday, up from 314 on Wednesday. It was 303 on Tuesday and 281 on Monday.AQI between zero and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate', 201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'.“The extremely calm wind conditions in Delhi and 25 per cent stubble share (fire count 2,293) are two major factors today,” SAFAR said.As per SAFAR model forecasts, the stubble burning share may increase to 35 per cent on Friday and 40 per cent on Saturday with the wind direction changing to northwesterly.Northwesterly winds carry smoke from farm fires in Punjab and Haryana towards the national capital.“Relief is expected only from the evening of November 7 but AQI will fluctuate within 'very poor' range,” the air quality forecast agency said.Last year, the share of stubble burning in Delhi's pollution had peaked at 42 per cent on November 5. In 2019, crop residue burning accounted for 44 per cent of Delhi's PM2.5 pollution on November 1.The contribution of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5 concentration was 32 per cent on Diwali day last year as compared to 19 per cent in 2019.On October 27, the Delhi government had launched the 'Patakhe Nahi Diye Jalao' campaign to create awareness against the bursting of crackers.Under the campaign, action can be taken under relevant IPC provisions and the Explosives Act against anyone found burning crackers.According to the government, more than 13,000 kg of illegal firecrackers have been seized and 33 people arrested so far under the anti-cracker campaign.Experts warned that emissions by firecrackers, if unchecked, could exacerbate already unfavourable meteorological conditions — including slow winds and below-normal temperatures, and the impact of stubble fires in neighbouring Haryana and Punjab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-chokes-for-breath-as-cracker-ban-goes-for-toss-in-diwali-101636042292048.html

Along with firecrackers, Pune also reported very light rainfall late on Thursday evening. As per the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Shivajinagar reported 1.4mm of rainfall followed by Lohegaon which reported 1mm of rainfall. Bhosari, Aundh, parts of Pashan, Pimpri and other parts of the city also reported a drizzle on Thursday. As per the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), air quality the morning of November 5 will be very poor due to burning of firecrackers on Thursday evening and early on Friday morning. The air quality on Thursday was moderate in most parts of the city till 4 pm.

Pashan, Katraj, Hadapsar, Lohegaon, Bhosari, Alandi and Bhomkar chowk had satisfactory air quality on Thursday.Dr BS Murthy, director at Safar and scientist at Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) said that if it rains, the air quality is likely to deteriorate further.“Due to drizzling, we may see that the air quality has worsened by Friday morning. However, the clear picture of how bad the air quality was on Thursday will be seen on Friday morning. Winter has already set in, with a 50 per cent additional firecracker scenario, Safar predicts that AQI will deteriorate to very poor on November 5,” said Dr Murthy.As per Safar forecasts, on November 5, PM2.5 will be 125 making it very poor air quality. Overall air quality in the city will be 303 which falls in the category of very poor.On Friday, forecasts suggest that areas like Shivajinagar, Hadapsar, Alandi, Bhosari, Nigadi and Bhumkar Chowk will have very poor air quality. Kothrud and Katraj will have poor air quality and Pashan will have moderate air quality.Due to low temperatures, the minimum temperature in the city was 18-19 degrees Celsius. The mixing layer height is likely to be low and winds are expected to be calm leading to accumulation and hence, faster deterioration of air quality, added Dr Murthy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-lights-up-for-diwali-as-air-quality-index-forecast-to-be-very-poor-on-nov-5-101636043287699.html
04-11-2021||Mumbai||High Covid CFR is cause of concern for Maharashtra authorities||Although the state has been witnessing a steady drop in the Covid-19 cases over last more than two months, the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) still remains a matter of concern for the authorities. In the last four days, 129 deaths have occurred against 4,221 number of new cases reported. In October, there were a total number of 60,222 new Covid-19 cases with 1149 deaths thus bringing the average CFR to 1.90%. In contrast, September reported a total of 85,980 new cases with 1754 deaths with the CFR of 2.04%.Experts said that a CFR of less than 1.5% indicates that a pandemic is under control. CFR measures the severity of a particular disease by defining the total number of deaths as a proportion of reported cases at a specific time. A major reason is high CFR is the deaths of senior citizens or those with comorbidities. Daily deaths reported in the state have been around 30-40 for last few weeks. Dr Om Srivastava, infectious disease expert who is also a member of the state appointed Covid-19 task force. “We are seeing an overall decline in the CFR. Ideally we should be having a CFR of less than 1.5 %.” State surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate said that authorities want to bring the death rate to zero. “We get around 1000 Covid-19 new cases daily and the deaths we are seeing is majorly of senior citizens or those with comorbidities after infected for Covid-19 virus,” he said.Nagpur witnessed zero Covid-19 positive cases on Thursday but flooded marketplaces and various Diwali special events call for caution before the pandemic is considered an endemic in the region. This was the second time Nagpur reported zero positive cases and deaths. The first was on September 29. However, doctors and experts said festivities, which were at its peak from Tuesday, might be going to be the most crucial period during the Covid-19 pandemic. After last year’s dull Diwali due to the pandemic enthusiasm seen in people this year could prove to be dangerous, Dr Uday Bodhankar said.Nagpur was one of the worst-hit districts in the state. The cumulative CFR, the total deaths—140,345 against the case tally of 6,615,299 is 2.12 %. Maharashtra on Friday recorded 1141 cases with 32 deaths. Mumbai reported 252 new cases and six deaths taking the tally to 6,615,299 and toll to 16,265.The state carried out 100,229 tests done on Friday while the number of recoveries was 1163. The total number of active patients in Maharashtra currently stands at 15,062. Of them the highest are in Mumbai (4160) followed by Pune (3190) and Ahmednagar (2015).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/high-covid-cfr-is-cause-of-concern-for-maharashtra-authorities-101636042993609.html

Presently, there are a maximum number of CCTVs installed in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ward office.The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has installed 3,424 CCTVs across the city for security purposes, especially women’s safety and security. Out of these, 3,181 CCTVs are operational. The CCTVs have been installed at chowks and on roads based on local corporators’ demands. The electrical department of the PMC is responsible for the installation and maintenance of the CCTVS. The CCTV feed is provided to local police stations for day-to-day monitoring and control of criminal activities in their respective areas.The Kasba-Vishrambaugwada ward office - which is a stronghold of BJP leaders and is represented by MLC Mukta Tilak, standing committee chairman Hemant Rasne, and PMC leader of the house Ganesh Bidkar along with other local corporators - has the maximum number of CCTVs (411) under its jurisdiction. The Kothrud-Bavdhan ward office – which is represented by mayor Murlidhar Mohol and Shiv Sena leader in the PMC and senior corporator Prithviraj Sutar – has the second highest number of CCTVs (271) under its jurisdiction. The Bibwewadi ward office – which is part of the Pune cantonment state assembly constituency and is represented by Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) Sunil Kamble – has the third highest number of CCTVs (261) under its jurisdiction.Shrinivas Kandul, head of the electrical department of the PMC, said, “As per the demand of local corporators, the administration installed CCTVs at chowks, on roads and at blind spots. Local corporators make provision of funds for the installation and maintenance of CCTVs. We connect the CCTVs to local police stations for day-to-day monitoring.”“Due to demand by local corporators, there are more CCTVs in the Kasba peth-Vishrambaugwada ward office jurisdiction. The other reason is that it is a densely populated area and market place. We have got proposals for around 200 new CCTV installations in different parts of the area. However, the proposals are yet to be sanctioned by different committees,” Kandul said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/200-cctvs-waiting-to-be-installed-while-200-defunct-in-pune-101636042992430.html
04-11-2021||Mumbai||Reduction in fuel prices would not immediately impact price of commodities: Experts||While welcoming the central government’s decision to reduce the excise duty on fuel, Mumbaikars are now looking to the state government in the hope that it would announce a reduction in Value Added Tax (VAT) to further bring down fuel prices in the city.However, experts said that this reduction would not immediately impact the price rise that several essential commodities have seen in the recent months. “It is a welcome move that the prices have been decreased on the occasion of Diwali. Fuel prices should be reduced further and the state government should also reduce VAT. Though the fuel prices are still high but at least there has been a decrease,” said Aishwarya Patel, a Vikhroli resident. Shirish Deshpande, chairman of Mumbai Grahak Panchayat(MGP) stated that decrease in prices of essential commodities was unlikely. “Once manufacturers or traders increase the price of commodities is it very difficult to reduce them unless the government comes down heavily on them. The traders keep on increasing the prices with the rise in fuel prices.”The Centre on Wednesday announced the reduction of excise duty on petrol and diesel by ₹5 and ₹10 respectively. Following this, the price of petrol came down to Rs.109.98 and diesel came down to Rs.94.14 in Mumbai on Thursday, decreasing by ₹5.87 and ₹12.48 respectively. By comparison, petrol and diesel were priced at Rs.115.85 and Rs.106.62 a litre respectively on Wednesday.The decrease was more than the reduction announced by the Centre due to the cascading effect of reduction of central duty on VAT. Maharashtra levies 25% VAT on fuel and a cess of ₹10.12 and Rs3 on petrol and diesel respectively. “The state taxes are levied on the collective figure of base price and central duty on the fuel. The reduction in the central duty has resulted in the reduction in value of the VAT helping in reducing the price further than the reduction initiated by the Centre,” an official from an oil company who did not wish to be quoted said. Petrol is now being sold at the price it was sold on October 9, while diesel is now being sold at the price it was on June 11.Fuel prices in the city began increasing starting May 3, when a litre of petrol cost Rs.96.83 and a litre of diesel cost Rs.87.81. Transporters associations also expressed relief at the decrease in fuel prices. “It is a small relief to the transport fraternity which was getting trampled under the ever rising fuel prices. Our long term demands, however, are still not met. These include quarterly revision in fuel prices, uniformity of fuel prices all across the country and petroleum products to be brought under the purview of Goods and Service Tax (GST),” said Bal Malkit Singh, chairman, All India Motor Transport Congress(AIMTC), said.The petrol dealers however stated that the prices have been reduced at the expense of loss to the dealers across the country. “Petrol dealers have suffered the most due to the decrease in the fuel prices. Even a small dealer has suffered a loss of nearly Rs3 lakh. This is because the petrol dealers across the country due to the approaching holidays already stored their pumps in full capacity on Thursday. There has been a drastic loss in a single day,” said Uday Lodh, president, Federation of all Maharashtra Petrol Dealers Association (FMPDA).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/reduction-in-fuel-prices-would-not-immediately-impact-price-of-commodities-experts-101636041367531.html
04-11-2021||Mumbai||Festive cheer: Stamp duty and registration collections see ₹550 crore jump in October||In a heartening revival from the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown, the state government has received a substantial jump of ₹550 crore in its collection of stamp duty and registration revenue in October. Stamp duty and registration collections reported in the month was ₹3,221 crore as against the monthly estimate of ₹2,667 crore. The rise in the collection has been attributed to the festive season, launch of new projects and the steady revival of the real estate sector after a slump for about one and half year. The budgeted estimated collection from the stamp duty and registration in financial year 2021-22 is ₹ 32,000 crore, which comes to ₹2,667 crore a month. After the major slump witnessed in April and May due to the second wave of the pandemic, the revenue receipts from the stamp duty and registration began to show an improvement. From a mere ₹ 835 crore in March, the collection went up to ₹2,640 crore in September. October however saw an even higher jump. “There is a post Covid-19 revival not only in the real estate market but even in other sectors as well. After the inventory from pre-Covid pandemic was exhausted, the builders launched new projects and entered into new development agreements, some of which are worth ₹1,200 to ₹2,000 crore, which means the duty and registration amount paid on them is high. Though the growth is across the state, it is higher in big cities like Mumbai, Thane, Navi Mumbai, Pune and Nashik,” said Dnyaneshar Khilari, joint inspector general of registration, Maharashtra. Another official from the revenue department said that they were seeing an improvement in revenue from banking, share market and industrial leasing as well. Real estate experts said the rise was because of the festive season and secondary sale of inventory. “Two third of the transactions in real estate markets are that of the resale of the flats possessed by the investors. They have been sold out of fear of potential further drop in the market and inability to pay off the loan taken on them. It is not true that the inventory from the pre-Covid-19 period exhausted. There are 2.81 lakh flats unsold in MMR, but yes, a few big players have succeeded in launching new projects by instilling confidence among the consumers that they will deliver on time,” said Pankaj Kapoor, Managing director, Liases Foras. Kapoor said that the new launches or the projects in big cities is also because of the state government’s decision to reduce the premium charges on fungible Floor Space Index (FSI). “The rebate will be in force till December and to take advantage of it, many big players are launching projects by registering development agreements. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation alone is expected to gain ₹8,400 crore till December from this premium,” he said. Khilari said that they expect the revenue growth to remain same in the remaining months of the financial year. “If the rally continues, we can touch up to ₹29,000 crore in the current financial year,” he said. The state government’s total revenue receipts in October was ₹23,438 crore, against ₹25,541 in September and ₹25,032 crore in August. The state government’s estimated revenue receipts in FY 21-22 is ₹3,68,987 crore against which its accumulated revenue receipts in seven months is ₹1,52,438 crore which is 41.31% of the target.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/festive-cheer-stamp-duty-and-registration-collections-see-550-crore-jump-in-october-101636040707431.html

PMC is now the biggest municipal corporation by area in Maharashtra, covering 516 sqkm. In 2017, the state government had merged 11 villages into the PMC. Residents are still waiting to get water supply, roads, drainage, and garbage disposal services.According to the PMC’ss property tax department, the total number of property owners due to pay property tax is 250,000 in all the merged villages.PMC has tabled aproperty tax proposal to fix property tax rates for these areas. The actual collection process will start next year. The property tax department has calculated the property tax from these properties to amount to ₹130 crore for 2022. PMC will send property tax bills in the March and April, 2022. Rajeshri Nath, a resident of Wagholi said, “We were paying property tax to the gram panchyat. It was affordable. We have a three-storied building and we paid ₹50,000 in property tax last year. After the merger, we haven’t received a property tax bill yet. We are worried. How can we pay more tax to PMC when we are not getting basic infrastructure?”Narendra Hagwane, resident of Kirkatwadi, one of the merged villages,”PMC will have to provide basic facilities such as water, drainage, roads and garbage collection. After that we will pay property tax. We want planned development from the PMC.”Abhiram Pathak, a resident of Ambegaon Budruk said, “We are part of the Pune corporation. I am living in a society. I paid around ₹6,000 in property tax last year to the gram panchayat. There will be an increase in property tax. PMC should charge us reasonably.”Abhijit Nanaware, a resident of Phursungi said, “At present, we are not getting basic facilities. We are getting water through tankers facilities. How can we pay more property tax to the PMC?” Vaibhav Kadlakh, assistant assessor and collector of the PMC property tax department said, “The department will increase property tax by 20 per cent. After five years, PMC will get ₹500 crore each year. Meanwhile, PMC will have to spend funds to develop basic infrastructure in the 23 villages. We are not getting revenue in terms of property tax immediately. We will have to wait for one year.”He added, “The tax is calculated on the basis of the state government ready reckoner rates. If the property is a new one, the ready reckoner rate is definitely more as compared to an old property. We will charge 20 per cent more on the existing property tax in the merged village areas. It is lower when compared to the existing PMC rates on property.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/property-tax-hike-in-merged-pune-villages-sparks-plaints-about-civic-amenities-101636040227470.html

Deshmukh, who appeared before ED for the first time on Monday after skipping multiple summons for the last four months, was arrested by the agency in the early hours of Tuesday in connection with the alleged ₹100-crore extortion and money laundering case. Officials said Deshmukh was arrested under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) as they claimed that the senior NCP leader was evasive during questioning and the agency will seek his custody after they produce him before a local court on Tuesday.“We cooperated in the investigation related to a case involving ₹4.5 crore... We will oppose his (Anil Deshmukh) remand when he is produced before the court today,” Inderpal Singh, the lawyer of Deshmukh had told reporters after his arrest.A holiday special court on Tuesday remanded him to ED custody till November 6. ED filed a case against Deshmukh and others after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) booked him in a corruption case related to allegations made by former Mumbai Police commissioner Singh.Singh alleged, in a letter to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray after he was removed from the police commissioner’s post, that Deshmukh asked Waze to extort over ₹100 crore a month from bars and restaurants in Mumbai. Deshmukh denied any wrongdoing and said that Singh made the allegations against him after he was removed from the post of Mumbai Police chief.The federal probe agency will record Deshmukh’s statement under PMLA in connection with the criminal investigation being carried out by it in the alleged ₹100 crore bribery-cum-extortion racket in Maharashtra police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/anil-deshmukh-taken-for-medical-check-up-101636039987294.html
04-11-2021||Pune||Nov 30 deadline for submission of Pune ward structures: SEC||PUNE: With the state election commission (SEC) declaring November 30 as the deadline to submit (draft) ward structures, all aspiring candidates are eager to know the ward structures and the areas falling under them.The state election commission had fixed 58 wards for the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) with 57 wards to have three members each and the remaining single ward to have four members. As the state election commission had fixed the ward numbers, local authorities would need to decide the size and geographical area of each ward. As such, the face of the existing wards would change completely.Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Nilesh Nikam said, “During the last elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) changed ward structures as per their convenience. Now we are hoping that the ward structures will remain constant. I am eager to know the wards and their boundaries.”A senior Congress leader on condition of anonymity said, “It is most likely that all the wards will be changed. The last time, BJP broke the slums into various parts. It helped the party to decentralise votes.”A senior NCP leader who did not wish to be named said, “It is true that the ruling party structured the wards in their favour. The last time the BJP was in power but now it is the Maha Vikas Aghadi’s (MVA’s) turn. It is but natural that ward structures will be decided as per the wishes of MVA candidates.”The local election branch helmed by the municipal commissioner will need to submit the draft ward structures to the state election commission by November 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/nov-30-deadline-for-submission-of-pune-ward-structures-sec-101636038487152.html

The school will be run with the help of a private educational institute. In the first year, it will have till Classes 9 and 10 and subsequently, the Classes will be increased.PMC education officer Shivaji Daundkar said, “The PMC owned a building at Balewadi survey numbers 5 and 19.

04-11-2021||Mumbai||Defeat BJP to bring fuel prices down by ₹50: Shiv Sena||Rajya Sabha MP and Shiv Sena spokesperson Sanjay Raut said on Thursday that Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will have to be electorally defeated to bring down fuel prices by ₹50. Raut’s comment came a day after the Central government reduced excise duty on fuel to bring petrol and diesel prices down by ₹5 and ₹10 respectively. The price of petrol reached a record ₹115.50 per litre in Mumbai on Monday, November 1, while diesel peaked at ₹106.62 per litre the same day.Sena’s allies in Maharashtra’s Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government – Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress – said Delhi’s move to slash excise duty on fuel came after BJP lost some crucial assembly and Lok Sabha bypolls held on Saturday, October 30.Senior Congress leader and former Union minister P Chidambaram said on Thursday that “the results of the recently concluded by-elections had a by-product” in the form of a reduction in excise duties on fuel. Sena and NCP leaders added that if fuel prices have to be brought down by ₹50, “BJP has to be defeated completely.” They added that the reduction in Central taxes – effective Thursday – was “too little too late.”Central excise on one litre of petrol was reduced on Wednesday from ₹32.90 to ₹27.90, while the levy on diesel came down from ₹31.80 to ₹21.80.Maharashtra’s BJP unit, however, questioned the state government whether there will be a reciprocal reduction in state taxes. At least 10 BJP-governed states – Assam, Tripura, Manipur, Karnataka, Goa, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand – announced additional cuts in petrol and diesel prices soon after the Centre’s announcement.Maharashtra BJP president Chandrakant Patil said, “The state does not seem to have any intention of cutting value-added tax (VAT) to further reduce fuel prices. They only know how to point fingers at the Centre.” A Central government statement said it had urged states to commensurately reduce the value-added tax (VAT) on petrol and diesel to give relief to consumers.Sena spokesperson Raut questioned the ₹5 reduction in petrol price after it had crossed ₹115. “The Centre should have reduced fuel prices by at least ₹25 per litre to provide relief to people,” he said on Thursday. “They (Centre) realised that prices need to be slashed after they lost the bypolls. Even after the loss, they reduced the price by only ₹5 [for petrol]. If we have to bring prices down by ₹50, we have to completely defeat BJP… They first hiked it over ₹100 and then reduced it by a mere ₹5.”Taking a swipe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Raut said people fill up their fuel tanks “in front of Modi’s hoardings, where he is giving them blessings… This needs to end after 2024.”NCP, too, said the BJP “got scared” after the recent bypoll results and that “fuel prices will reduce further if agitations against the unreasonable hike intensify.” NCP spokesperson and state minister Nawab Malik said, “After losing bypolls in several states, they (BJP) are scared. This is the reason excise duty on fuel has reduced immediately. Fuel prices have been reduced only because of the ‘defeat BJP agitation’. Continue this agitation, and prices will reduce further.”Maharashtra Congress spokesperson Atul Londhe said the record fuel prices resulted in high inflation and that “97% of the population lost its purchasing power.” Londhe said on Thursday, “The petrol and diesel prices were ₹71 and ₹58 a litre respectively when crude oil prices were US$107 a barrel in 2014 during the Congress-led government. The Central excise duty was ₹3.56 and ₹9.48 a litre respectively on diesel and petrol. Today, crude oil price is around US$83 a barrel. Yes, fuel prices are at an all-time high.”BJP leader and former minister Ashish Shelar said that it’s time now for the state government to reduce its excise duty to give greater respite. “Shiv Sena and two other ruling parties had been making hue and cry over the fuel price rise all these days. Posters and banners were put up by Shiv Sena at various places. I am sure the party which leads the state government in Maharashtra will reduce its excise to give the respite to the people. It is time for the state government to show that its concern about the fuel rise is not fake,” he said.Malik said the MVA government is ready to implement the taxation policy of Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government on fuel prices. “If the taxation policy of the UPA is implemented, then prices will drastically reduce,” he said.Sanjay Raut said that Maharashtra government will consider bringing down the VAT on fuel. “Discussions are on,” he said. “The state government will think about it, but the larger responsibility [to reduce fuel prices] rests on the Central government. The Maharashtra government has constantly raised questions about people facing the heat of inflation. Yuva Sena recently carried out protests against the price rise.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/defeat-bjp-to-bring-fuel-prices-down-by-50-shiv-sena-101636038127345.html

On Wednesday, a 12-year-old boy riding a bicycle died after he crashed into the railings of a bridge over a nullah coming down the said slope. “The slope from Dattangar Chowk is very steep and vehicles come in full speed. In the last five years we have seen atleast one accident every month at this spot where the boy died yesterday. There were iron railings installed over the nullah, but two months back an autorickshaw crashed into the barricades,” said Chowrekar. This slope is of a 3km stretch and on Thursday, when HT visited the road, there were several potholes. One speed breaker, which is just before the accident spot, is large in size and locals believe it should be to shifted further down the road. There is a need for rumblers and signages telling motorises to slow down on the slope. Another resident Sharad Ghodake said, “We are afraid of traveling through this road. Our only request to save lives is that the PMC should now repair of this road, and most importantly shift the wrongly constructed speed breaker elsewhere.” In the accident that happened early on Wednesday morning, the 12-year-old boy while riding his bicycle crashed into railings and died from head injuries. He was immediately rushed to a nearby private hospital by the locals, where he was declared dead by doctors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/why-slope-between-dattanagar-chowk-and-ambegaon-budruk-is-a-killer-as-per-punekars-101636037887075.html

They are spending a total of ₹229Cr for the work, a senior officer said.According to Sanjay Desai, city engineer of NMMC, they started concretising around 15km of the road near Indira Nagar and Ambedkar Nagar in Turbhe in the second week of October. So far, they have completed around 15% of the work.Secondly, the civic body started concretising around 6.90km of the road in the area behind LP Junction in Nerul last month. Apart from concretising the main road, they are also developing gutters, pavements and installing street lights there. A budget of ₹58Cr was allocated for that and so far, around 40% work has been completed.The MIDC areas in Navi Mumbai has a total of 136km road of which NMMC concretised around 86km road in the past decade.Talking about the previous projects, Desai said, “We recently completed the concretisation of Patni Road (2.5km) in Digha and the road (3.04km) that connects Mukund Chowk and Ajanta Painters along the Thane-Belapur Road. Concretisation of the road (4.70km) between Uran Phata and Turbhe police station is now under way and will be completed within a few weeks.”A senior MIDC official from Mahape said, “The business and economy of Navi Mumbai is directly related to the MIDC areas located beside the city. A huge number of Navi Mumbai residents come to work in our areas every day. Therefore, we are taking help from the civic body in terms of developing infrastructure here. We are also doing some work on our own. For example, we are in the process of concretising around 15km of road in some pockets. A budget of ₹262Cr has been allocated for that. We hope that within the next one year, all roads in the MIDC areas (in Navi Mumbai) will be concretised.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/navi-mumbai-civic-body-starts-concretising-roads-in-midc-area-101636037651420.html

They have alleged that Wankhede used fake documents to make the certificate and if found guilty his certificate should be immediately cancelled and all benefits be withdrawn.The complaints were filed by Bhim Army and Swabhimani Republican Paksh on November 3. They were filed days after allegations against Wankhede of making a caste certificate using fake documents.Bhim Army, general secretary Ashok Kamble in his complaint to the caste validity committee said, “An SC caste certificate can be issued by the competent authority of the district where the ancestors of the concerned family are residing since 1950, hence, Wankhede’s father (Dnyandev Wankhede) made his caste validity certificate from Washim district in 2008, but in case of Sameer Wankhede, it was made in Mumbai.”“Going by his birth certificate, Sameer Wankhede is found to be a Muslim. He has admitted this by signing his ‘Nikahnama’ (marriage certificate under Islamic law) which states that he is marrying under Sharia law. It shows that right from his birth on December 14, 1979, Wankhede was a Muslim but made a SC caste certificate by misleading the competent authority,” the complaint states further.Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) minister Nawab Malik had claimed that Wankhede is a Muslim but secured the IRS (Indian Revenue Service) job in the Scheduled Caste (SC) category using his father’s old caste, who converted to Islam before marrying Wankhede’s mother Zaheda Bano. He had also released the birth and marriage certificates of Wankhede to corroborate his claim.Wankhede and his father Dnyaneshwar have refuted the claims saying they never converted to Muslim.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/two-dalit-outfits-file-complaint-seek-probe-into-sameer-wankhede-s-caste-certificate-101636037467567.html

The purpose behind the meeting was to discuss the rising number of complaints against auto rickshaw drivers, particularly those who pick up fares from outside the Thane Railway Station on the West side.During this meeting, the police had asked the union leaders to get their members to follow the rules laid down as per the Motor Vehicles Act and not violate them for any reason. Ample warning was also given about the impending crackdown.Accordingly, from October 20, the Traffic Police, along with the local police, the Railway Protection Force, the Government Railway Police and the Regional Transport Office, started taking action against any and all auto drivers found to be in violation of rules.“The offences for which we have penalised auto rickshaw drivers so far include not wearing the white uniform or auto driver’s badge, overcharging passengers, breaking the queue, not following the queue at all and entering the station premises to pick up fares instead of waiting for their turn at the auto rickshaw stand outside the station,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Traffic), Balasaheb Patil, Thane City police, said. He added that over a period of 14 days, outside Thane station alone, a total of 2,622 errant auto rickshaw drivers have been penalised, with the amount collected in fines coming up to ₹5.52 lakh.According to the data obtained from the police, the most number of cases have been filed for picking up fares from spots other than the rickshaw stand, followed by offences like not wearing uniforms, not wearing badges, parking in a way that causes obstructions to traffic, parking in no parking zones and seating fares on the front seat. “The campaign will continue till we see a substantial difference in the number of violations.

The innovative programme conceptualised by municipal commissioner, Abhijit Bangar, is being implemented in all the schools of Navi Mumbai. The programme is being supported by Heart Foundation, an NGO working in the educational field.Bangar said, “We have appealed to all schools in the city to participate and we are getting very encouraging responses from them. We are confident of the participation of over 50,000 students from Classes 2 to 10 in this campaign. Through the students, the awareness will reach their families and neighbours as well.”Students will have to collect non-degradable plastic waste like chocolate wrappers, wafer packets, single-use plastic bags, etc. and put them in a one-litre plastic bottle. These bottles have to be deposited with the school.Deputy municipal commissioner (solid waste management), Babasaheb Rajale, said, “The student submitting the most number of bottles in each ward will be given the `Zero Plastic Waste Champion’ award. Similarly, the student who submits maximum bottles in the city will be awarded with ‘Zero Plastic Waste Navi Mumbai Champion’ title.”Each student will get a participating certificate from NMMC. The school in each ward that will submit the maximum number of bottles will be awarded as ‘Zero Plastic Waste School’. There will also be an award for the school that performs the best in the city.The plastic articles collected will be given to a recycling agency that would convert them into fuel. The plastic bottles would be given to artists to make sculptures that would be displayed in the city.Jaykar Ellis, founder president, Heart Foundation, said, “Plastic is very harmful for the environment and human life. Hence, it is important that its use is curbed on a large scale. Along with implementing the rules in place for such prevention, it is equally important that there is awareness. The next generation needs to understand it early and hence we are involving them through this campaign.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/navi-mumbai-civic-body-ropes-in-50k-students-for-its-zero-plastic-campaign-101636035552384.html
04-11-2021||Pune||Fuel price drops... Punekars say not good enough||PUNE: In the wake of the Union government’s decision, petrol and diesel prices in the city have dropped by ₹5 and ₹10, respectively. On Thursday, the price of petrol dropped to ₹109.5 per litre while the price of diesel came down to ₹92.5 per litre. The price of premium petrol, too, reduced to ₹113.5 per litre in Pune. However, transport operators and citizens expressed dissatisfaction saying that even these prices are too high and that further relief should be provided.Baba Shinde, director of the All India Motor Transport Congress (Maharashtra), said, “It’s good that the government thought of cutting down the excise duty and reducing fuel prices. But even ₹93 is still a pretty high price for diesel and it should be further brought down. Ideally, diesel should be in the range of ₹70 per litre as it was a few years ago. Only then transporters will get some relief. Now the Union government has reduced the taxes, I hope that the state government will also do its part by cutting down excessive taxes on fuel prices.”The continuous hike in fuel prices has put too much of a strain on the common man. Amol Bharati, who runs a small transportation business in the city, demanded more affordable rates for fuel. “Earlier, we only used to joke about petrol crossing the ₹100 mark but in the recent past, it has become a reality and we are all suffering while living with it. Not only petrol but also diesel has crossed the ₹100 mark. I just want to point out that even the reduced prices are not normal. While comparing with a litre of petrol at ₹60, ₹105 is still a very big number. Fuel prices should be brought down to this level and common people should get some relief,” Bharati said.Some citizens expressed apprehension about how long the reduced prices would remain as such. Apoorva Parakhi, a resident of the Warje area, said, “The prices have come down. But as we have been witnessing, fuel prices have recorded a hike almost on a daily basis. If that trend continues, the current relief will prove temporary. Fuel prices should not be related to the elections. People should get permanent relief and a proper mechanism should be put in place to control these prices.”Earlier, when asked whether the state government will cut taxes on fuel prices to bring relief to the common man, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar had said that the Union government should make the first move. Now that the Union government and other state governments have cut down taxes on fuel prices, it remains to be seen whether the state government walks the talk.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/fuel-price-drops-punekars-say-not-good-enough-101636035426932.html

The court observed that the builder “took law in his own hands and tried to dispossess the victim and his family by demolishing the wall”. The incident took place last November when the builder, Chunilal Rita, allegedly brought a hammer and started demolishing the wall of the complainant’s shop. When the complainant, Ashok Haria, intervened, he attacked him with the hammer on the head. The complainant told the police that his mother Sushilaben owns a grocery shop at Bashir Mohammed Chawl on Bhavani Shankar Road in Dadar (West) and had a dispute with the firm which is carrying out the redevelopment of the dilapidated chawl. Rita is one of the partners of the firm, which had offered the Haria family a flat on the 14th floor of the proposed building in lieu of their grocery shop. However, Haria rejected the offer, resulting in a civil litigation. On November 24, 2020, Rita came to the chawl around 10.30am and started breaking the wall of Haria’s shop with a hammer. When the complainant and her mother tried to intervene, he allegedly abused them and continued breaking the wall. When Ashok came to the spot, Rita threatened him and hit him with the hammer on head. Additional sessions judge MG Deshpande said the photographs available on record indicated that the victim was mercilessly beaten by the builder. “Though the applicant, Chunilal Rita, a resident of Dadar (West) claims to be an old person, the fact is that he had given a heavy blow of hammer on the head of the victim. Not only this, he was to give further blows, but people rescued the victim and removed the hammer from the hands of the applicant,” said the court while rejecting his bail plea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-court-refuses-bail-to-dadar-based-builder-held-for-assaulting-shop-owner-101636035066829.html

The mall authorities, however, have denied the allegations and claimed that the amount is disputed and the matter is sub-judice.A team of civic officials were also in the mall earlier this week to inform the mall authorities to clear the amount.An officer requesting anonymity said, “The defaulted amount of over ₹8.50Cr is for both last year and the current financial year. We met the mall authorities who told us they will clear the tax in instalments as it is not possible to clear the entire amount in one go. We have asked them to give us a letter informing us when they will clear the amount.”The Mall, in its statement, said, “Korum Management has filed a writ petition in the Bombay High Court seeking directions against TMC to give required benefit under law and also to allow the adjustment of excess amount already paid by the company towards property tax over the past several years. The alleged claim of property tax, if any, is disputed and the matter is pending and sub-judice with the Bombay High Court.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/korum-mall-among-defaulters-owes-rs8-50cr-in-property-tax-claims-thane-civic-body-101636034407662.html
04-11-2021||Mumbai||BMC to revamp precincts of Gateway of India||To provide a clear view of the heritage monument and the statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, from the approach road, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) will soon revamp the precincts of the Gateway of India. According to the plan approved by the Mumbai Heritage Conservation Committee (MHCC), the plaza building, built 15 years ago inside the premises, will be demolished and reconstructed nearby. The existing garden around the Shivaji Maharaj statue and fountain will be opened for the public. The project is likely to cost ₹20 crore.Gateway of India that overlooks the Arabian Sea, was erected to commemorate the visit of King George V and Queen Mary to Mumbai in the 20th century, which is one of the popular tourists’ sites today.Currently, the view is blocked by a plaza at the entrance.An official from the BMC said, “The new design will ensure visual access to visitors so that people can see the Gateway of India, the sea and will get a chance to see the statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, which is currently lost in all the visual clutter.”The MHCC’s no-objection certificate (NOC) requires the BMC to maintain the vista of the customs building, which is a very old structure and a part of the original setting of the Gateway of India but is not a listed heritage building.The MHCC in its approval, recently stated, “The proposed structures of ticketing, security office and toilet shall be kept as narrow and as small as possible, in terms of footprint and appearance. Maximum effort shall be made to open up the view of the existing ‘Customs Building’ which is part of the original setting of the Gateway of India site.”The approval further states, “Existing garden around the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj statue and fountain will be opened up for the public. It was also advised to streamline all services, light-poles, security systems, railings and dustbins in a minimal way to complement the heritage site. The civic body said that the idea is to streamline the entire surrounding without any ad-hoc placement of security tents. The eateries inside the plaza will also be shifted within the premises before the ticket counter. The civic body is likely to do away with the heavy barricading at the entrance. The committee has suggested the implementation of advanced surveillance, security technology to reduce the physical requirement of structures and manpower.The plan came into the picture after last year after the state tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray, in a meeting with deputy chief minister and finance minister Ajit Pawar, had discussed the development and conservation of 22 tourist sites, including the Gateway of India. The tourism department led by Thackeray has also planned to hold a sound and light show at the site. As per the initial discussions, the light show will be based on different themes related to the history of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, the Marathas and the freedom movement among others.Further, according to BMC officials, since the maintenance of the site and area around it is divided among various agencies, it will also write to several agencies informing them about the plan. Also, the state government in September last year constituted a committee of senior officials from the BMC, the Maharashtra Maritime Board (MMB), the state archaeological department, Mumbai Port Trust (MbPT) and the police department owing to multiple agencies involved. The heritage structure and the 100-metre area near it come under the state archaeological department, while the jetty and boating area is under the MbPT. The area outside it falls under the BMC, which includes the plaza approach pathways.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-to-revamp-precincts-of-gateway-of-india-101636034346694.html

On Thursday, three localities in Kalyan (E) were cleaned.A team of 10-12 from the NGO jointly took up the cleaning work and followed it by decorating the area with paintings and placing metal murals of peacock and a deer to beautify the area and ensure that the dumping activity does not continue in the future.“During the festival, we make sure our houses are cleaned and decorated. Like we clean our houses to welcome the festival, it is also necessary to keep our surroundings, which we use daily, clean. In Kalyan (E) there are several areas on the roadside where dumping activity is regular. Even if the garbage is lifted, the locals again dump waste and make the area unclean,” said Vijay Bhosle, founder of the NGO.The NGO took up the cleaning work of five roads in Kalyan (E) namely the Cow Stable at Lakshmibaug, Saket Building Chinchpada, Model College, Seven Foot Road Buddha Vihar and Dr Bhujbal Clinic on Pune Link Road. “We have placed a replica of deer and peacock at some spots to beautify the area and ensure people don’t dump waste again,” added Bhosle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ngo-takes-up-cleaning-of-streets-in-kalyan-this-diwali-101636030390782.html
04-11-2021||Mumbai||HC junks Mumbai Bank’s plea challenging inquiry ordered by divisional jt registrar||The Bombay high court (HC) last week dismissed a petition filed by the Mumbai District Central Co-operative Bank (also known as Mumbai Bank), challenging an inquiry ordered by the divisional joint registrar of co-operative societies.The divisional joint registrar of Mumbai division had on September 22 appointed an inquiry officer to probe into different issues highlighted in a recent test audit report, including the expenditure incurred by the bank in the past five years on updating its computer programme, system maintenance expenditure, hardware purchases, repairs and renovation of immovable property, outstanding loans given by the bank under the corporate loan policy, loans given to co-operative housing societies, outstanding loans given by violating the area of its operation to sugar factories and other establishments and gold mortgage loan in the unproductive category.The bank had moved HC challenging the order, primarily on the ground that the divisional joint registrar ordered the inquiry on the basis of the test audit report, but without giving an opportunity to the bank to rectify the defects pointed out in the report.A single judge bench of justice Girish Kulkarni on October 28 rejected the argument and dismissed the bank’s petition, observing that sections 82 and 83 of the Maharashtra Co-operative Societies (MCS) Act, 1960 – which deal with rectification of defects pointed out by auditors and the registrar’s power to order inquiry – are independent provisions, and the opportunity of rectifying the defects highlighted in the test audit report cannot be a condition precedent for ordering the inquiry.Justice Kulkarni also said that no prejudice would be caused to the bank by the inquiry ordered under section 83, more particularly when its business involves trust and confidence of its depositors, which certainly would have a cascading effect on the public at large. “Even if such an inquiry is undertaken and on conclusion of an inquiry, there are defects which are pointed out. Clearly, section 87 of the (MCS) Act provides for an opportunity to the petitioner [the bank] to comply with the deficiencies and/or defects,” said the bench.“In these circumstances, the petitioner ought not to be concerned when an inquiry has been ordered to bring about transparency and accountability in the affairs of the petitioner, more particularly when financial irregularities and/or substantial defects are alleged to be noted in the test audit report as also in the report of the special auditor,” the court added.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator and leader of opposition in the Maharashtra legislative Council, Pravin Darekar, is currently the chairman of Mumbai Bank.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hc-junks-mumbai-bank-s-plea-challenging-inquiry-ordered-by-divisional-jt-registrar-101636028886535.html

Most of them have lost their crops due to unseasonal rains and are unable to enjoy the festivities this Diwali.A Good Samaritan from Murbad, homemaker Urmila Late, 42, however, has now lent a helping hand to some of them. Along with her husband, Late has distributed clothes and sweets to more than a hundred families in two of the tribal hamlets in Murbad so they do not have to get those on credit for their families.Late has been staying in Murbad post her marriage and helps her husband in the small business of selling car batteries. She saw people suffering in this taluka since the lockdown. She has used the money saved for their children’s education and travel expenses over the last two years.Late said, “Last year, many people lost their family members or jobs to the pandemic and hardly anyone celebrated Diwali. This year, when things are starting to return to normal and people are looking forward to a better celebration, due to unseasonal rains, most of them lost their crops. Very few were able to re-sow them and those too will have to wait for the yield. This year also, they will have to live on credit as most of their savings are spent on health and daily expenses.”She and her husband decided that they would fulfil the Diwali needs of these families by gifting them essential items.Late said, “We have a packet of sweets (faral) and new clothes for their families including children. We have distributed these items to two Adivasi Padas –Vanjale Vadi and Patgao – of Murbad. We have our savings for our children’s education, which we have not really used for the past three years. As all traveling expenses were also reduced, we used it for these people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/thane-district-homemaker-makes-diwali-special-for-villagers-in-murbad-101636028766962.html
04-11-2021||Mumbai||UGC gives Chowpatty’s 185-year-old Wilson College autonomous status||MUMBAI: The 185-year-old Wilson College in Mumbai’s Chowpatty has become the 46th institute affiliated with the University of Mumbai (MU) to be awarded the autonomous status, according to a communication by the University Grants Commission to the college management on Wednesday.“As per the decision of the standing committee constituted by UGC, in its meeting held on October 22, the competent authority has decided to grant autonomous status to Wilson College, Chowpatty, affiliated with University of Mumbai for a period of ten years from 2021-2022 to 2030-31 academic years,” the higher education regulator said in its letter.UGC grants the autonomous status, valid for 10 years, based on a college’s academic record, infrastructure, research activities, faculty and innovative teaching methods. Academic autonomy will allow Wilson College to design its own curricula and hold its exams in senior college courses. The college faculty can also design the curriculum instead of following the syllabus laid down by Mumbai University. The students will continue to get their degrees from MU.“We are thrilled to have received this honour,” said T Shiware, director education, John Wilson Education Society that runs the college.The college said it took them less than a year to get approvals for the prestigious status.“Our application went online earlier this year and while Covid-19 delayed some of the processes, UGC appointed committee visited in October this year,” Shiware added.As reported by HT, UGC recently amended its regulations for conferring autonomous status that makes it simpler for colleges to apply for autonomy. The number of colleges granted autonomous status in the city has gone up from 35 colleges in February 2020 to 45 in October 2021.“Earlier the process of autonomy was a two-step process and colleges first had to seek approval from the affiliated university before approaching UGC. But now UGC has streamlined the process, and this has encouraged more colleges to apply and achieve the autonomous status in the past one year,” said Deepak Wasave, deputy registrar, affiliation section, MU. He added that with the change in rules approved by UGC in 2018, colleges now only need affiliation confirmation from the respective university and can then directly approach UGC. “This cuts down the process time by more than half, helping more and more colleges to seek autonomy,” he said. Well-performing colleges were first encouraged to seek autonomy to help reduce the burden on MU, which has more than 800 affiliated colleges. The state education department also encouraged ‘A’ grade accredited colleges to apply for autonomy and handed over the reins of academic growth to the institutes themselves. UGC earlier said colleges that get ‘A’ grade in three consecutive National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) cycles should be awarded autonomous status. The new guidelines also said that colleges with a NAAC score of 3.51 and above shall be considered for autonomous status “without onsite visit by the expert committee” of UGC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ugc-gives-chowpatty-s-185-year-old-wilson-college-autonomous-status-101636027627927.html
04-11-2021||Mumbai||Cultural scene returns to Thane; theatre artistes excited to perform again||Like Pune, Thane is known as a Cultural City for its theatre and musical events. After 19 months in lockdown, most theatre and musical groups are excited to set the stage on fire this DiwaliBack are the Diwali Pahats, which were online last year, as the relaxation in the rules have been like a breath of fresh air for local residents and performing artistes. Thane’s cultural scene is getting back on track. The thrill of performing live before the audience is not found online, claimed the artistes.A week ahead of Diwali, many organisations like Swatva and Abhinay Katta started with their regular activities after 19 months of online entertainment.“To be back offline after a gap of 19 months was an amazing feeling. The connection between audience and performers was developed again through our live performances. It was for the first time in all these years that we went online due to the circumstances,” said Kiran Nakati, chairman, Abhinay Katta.This is one of the platforms in Thane that curates and performs plays in Marathi and has gone digital due to the pandemic. Located near Bhaskar Colony, an amphitheatre inside the Jijau Garden is where they perform regularly every week. This is also well-known as many popular Marathi actors have kickstarted their careers from Abhinay Katta.There used to be a crowd at Abhinay Katta and many times, popular actors would also pay a visit. However, keeping in mind the Covid protocols, a cap on the number of people to perform and the audience has been put in place. Despite this, the excitement among everyone continues.The Drum Circle, another group, also held a session two weeks back at the amphitheatre near Upvan Lake. Many onlookers joined their session impromptu.“It was not only an opportunity to meet new people but also a chance to interact with those whom we used to gel creatively until the pandemic struck. Thane’s cultural scene is getting back on track. This is a positive feeling. There are many who will initiate more such interesting concepts as many have been staying indoors in the last one-and-a-half years,” said Shripad Bhalerao, one of the founders of the Drum Circle.Drum Circle is a concept where a group of people gather at a public place and make a song of their own. Everyone gets different types of drums and percussion. If nothing, they just make use of the props available at the location or clap away.Theatres have also received a go ahead from the state government. Thane residents are always known for their affection towards Marathi theatre and theatre artistes also enjoy performing in the city.Balachandra Buge, administrator, Kashinath Ghanekar and Gadkari Rangayatan, Thane, said, “It is a pleasant feeling to hear the cheers and claps when the curtain rises. After almost 19 months of silence, although the theatre is open only to 50% capacity, the response is good. Gadkari Ragayatan is undergoing renovation, so we have not opened it yet for shows. However, Kashinath Ghanekar has already had a few plays last week and for Diwali Pahat, well-known singer-composer duo, Saleel Kulkarni and Mahesh Kale, will be performing at Ghanekar.”The theatre is well set with self-temperature check facility and sanitisers, floor markings at lobbies to maintain social distance and also inside the theatre for seating.Moreover, many parts of Thane, especially Owla, have sets of popular Marathi serials. Shooting of many movies also takes place in Thane city.“There is proximity to Mumbai. Moreover, we have provision for both urban as well as greenery to shoot. Hence, we have been receiving permission letters from various production houses since the second wave subsided. It is only from August-September that we started giving permission keeping in mind all Covid protocols,” said Rajesh Narvekar, Collector, Thane District.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cultural-scene-returns-to-thane-theatre-artistes-excited-to-perform-again-101636027508752.html
04-11-2021||Mumbai||Foreigner held for fraudulently diverting ₹5.43cr from Bank of Baharain and Kuwait||Mumbai The south region cyber police have arrested a 29-year-old Nigerian national who is an alleged key member of a gang that hacked into the computer system of the Bank of Bahrain and Kuwait and fraudulently withdrew an amount of ₹5.43 crore from three bank accounts.The accused, Michael Chibuzi Okonko, was arrested from Delhi on October 31 and brought to Mumbai following a complaint by Dev Narayan, senior vice-president of the bank’s Mumbai branch. According to the complaint, the bank stated that in August, it had detected unlawful transactions worth ₹5.43 crore from its customer accounts. The money was fraudulently transferred from the accounts of its three customers to multiple other bank accounts.Accordingly, a case was registered under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Information Technology Act, 2000, by the south region cyber police. Acting swiftly, the police froze ₹86 lakh, but the remaining amount was already withdrawn by the fraudsters.“On going through the details of the beneficiary bank’s account holders, investigators learnt that the amount was fraudulently diverted and credited to bank accounts of people in Delhi, Madhya Pradesh and Assam,” said a police officer.In Assam, the beneficiary account belonged to a woman who told the police that a person who befriended her on social media in February asked her to open the account.“The person claimed to be a doctor and told her that he wished to open a clinic in Delhi. But for opening the clinic and transferring the money he needed a bank account first. Hence, he requested her to open a bank account and link his newly procured mobile number to it and send the SIM card his address. The woman followed his instructions and opened a bank account, which was later used to transfer amount of ₹6.12 lakh of the defrauded amount,” said the officer. The cyber police identified the ATM kiosk in Delhi from where the fraud money was withdrawn. Okonko was caught on CCTV camera at the kiosk while withdrawing money. The police seized 11 mobiles phones, two hard disks, three laptops and a SIM card from him. Preliminary investigation has revealed that the accused allegedly committed the offence with the help of his friend. In Madhya Pradesh, an unemployed teacher was made to open a bank account for a commission of ₹10,000. Later the fraud money was diverted into his account and withdrawn by the fraudsters, said the police officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/foreigner-held-for-fraudulently-diverting-5-43cr-from-bank-of-baharain-and-kuwait-101636026186437.html
04-11-2021||Mumbai||Endangered lesser florican rescued in Solapur||A female lesser florican — an endangered species of bustard — was rescued by the forest department in Solapur this week. The bird was subsequently tagged with a metal ring, bearing a unique ID number and released nearby at the Great Indian Bustard (Maldhok) Bird Sanctuary, where officials said, it will have a greater chance of survival. The lesser florican (Sypheotides indicus) is one of three bustard species endemic to India, the others being the Bengal florican and the Great Indian Bustard. Less than 270 lesser floricans are estimated to be alive in the wild. The sighting of the bird was reported on November 2 by a resident of Nannaj in Solapur North tehsil. He noticed an unusual-looking bird taking shelter near his home to escape a pack of stray dogs, chasing after it. After shooing away the dogs, he informed the nearby Maldhok Sanctuary and the forest department’s office in Nannaj. A team from the Solapur forest department and the NGO Wildlife Conservation Association (WCA) moved the bird to the district veterinary hospital as she had a small injury on her wing. After examining the bird and administering first aid, the district veterinarian’s office issued a certificate stating that she is fit to be released back into the wild. The bird was released at the bird sanctuary the same afternoon, around 2pm, in the presence of deputy forest conservator Dhairyashil Patil range officer Shubhangi Jawale, as well as WCA members. A female individual of the same species was last seen in Maharashtra in August this year when it was photographed at the Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve. In the local language, the bird is known as ‘tanmor’ on ‘kharmor’, derived from the root word ‘mor’ for peacock, a forest department official explained. “Four years ago, a lesser florican was also seen near the district police headquarters in Solapur. They are an endangered species, but this sighting is important because it tells us they are still present in the area,” said the official, who did not wish to be identified.  A report by the Wildlife Institute of India in 2018 had estimated their remaining population in the wild to be not more than 264 individuals, indicating a decline of about 80% in the last two decades alone. This species is classified as ‘endangered’ by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and also features in Appendix 2 of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which “includes species not necessarily threatened with extinction, but in which trade must be controlled in order to avoid utilization incompatible with their survival.” It is also protected under Schedule 1 of the Indian Wildlife Act. Kedar Gore, wildlife biologist, director of the Corbett Foundation and member of three separate IUCN commissions, explained that the primary driver for the rapid decline in lesser florican numbers is the disappearance of grasslands and their associated ecosystems. “Forests in India are better protected, but grasslands are not even seen as having any ecological value. After hunting first drove down the numbers of these birds, their habitat has been under threat in Maharashtra mainly due to the expansion of industries in grassland areas. In Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, renewable energy projects have been established on their grasslands, which is where these birds mate. The Corbett Foundation, Bombay Natural History Society, state governments and various experts have been actively working on conservation measures, but there needs to be a wide-ranging policy to arrest the sort of land-use change which is destroying the lesser floricans’ habitat.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/endangered-lesser-florican-rescued-in-solapur-101636025346063.html

In the CCTV, the toddler was nowhere to be seen and hence we suspected that he might have done something to the child,” Raigad superintendent of police, Ashok Dudhe, said.The police then started contacting people known to him in Mumbai and other parts and learnt that he was going to Silvasa.“We laid a trap in Silvasa and nabbed the accused. On his arrest, he revealed that he had strangulated and then thrashed the head of the child with a rock on Roha-Murud road and then dumped the body in the bushes near the road. We recovered the body and handed it over to the parents,” police inspector Dayanand Gawade said.The accused, a class XII pass who worked in a courier company is currently in police custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/30yearold-man-arrested-for-killing-27-month-old-baby-in-raigad-101636023905890.html
04-11-2021||Pune||Taste of Life: Notes from a memoir on a feast for Diwali defying the plague||Food is a great unifying force. Festivals and feasts always involve the sharing and eating of food, even when it may be underemphasised compared to the other activities going on around it.Food brings out empathy. It has that magical power to make one believe that grief is temporary.Henry Woodd Nevinson was a British war correspondent during the Second Boer War and World War I, a campaigning journalist exposing slavery in Western Africa, political commentator, and suffragist. He arrived at Bombay in October 1907, as a correspondent for the “Manchester Guardian” and other papers.He spent a year in India, of which a month was spent in Pune. Nevinson’s socio-political memoir “The new spirit in India” records a feast on a Diwali night during the plague.“It was the Indian festival of Diwali, held at Poona on Guy Fawkes’ Day, and celebrated with innumerable flames, like our own thanksgiving for the protection of King and Parliament. But, in feeling, the Diwali comes nearer to Christmastide, for it has no political significance, and the flames are not lighted as defiance to the Pope of Rome, but in honour of Lakshmi, the goddess of family prosperity, who provides wealth sufficient for us, and holds a baby to the breast above her heart”, wrote Nevinson.The ceilings of the rooms in wadas and the verandahs fluttered with pink and yellow flags; the windows and doors were hung with “festoons of orange marigolds on a string”; upon the entrance pavement neat patterns in whitewash were drawn by hand-rollers; and, as the streets turned blue with the evening, the children, draped in all the gorgeous crimsons and golds their fathers could afford, lighted the tiny oil lamps on window-sill and doorstep, or threw the spurting fires under the “very noses of sacred bulls that wander for their living from shop to shop”.Nevinson observed that “other helpful powers beside Lakshmi had a share in the honour, and it were the temples of Durga and Vishnu, of Siva and Parvati, lady of the far-off mountain snow that made the sacred hill of Parvati outside the city sparkle like an illuminated birthday cake, for at least one night during the Diwali feast of brotherhood”.But the sad thing was that in the lane of Pune, many of the houses then stood dark and empty, in terror of the plague. Hardly eleven years had passed since the pestilence first appeared, imported from Hong Kong as people thought, and in those eleven years, it had killed nearly six million of India’s habitants. Within those eleven years, the inhabitants of Pune had been reduced to nearly one-third.Many families had gone to live in selected open spaces outside the city when Nevinson visited. There among rocks and withered grass, they kindled their little lamps and celebrated family joy in any hut of wicker, matting, canvas, petroleum tins, old boxes, boards, or branches which they and the Imperial Government could manage to rig up between them. Many shopkeepers had transferred their little stores of grain, sweets, and cotton to this countrified scene, and the “general effect was like a scrappy Derby Day without the races”.On the night of Lakshmipujan, Nevinson set out to meet Gopal Krishna Gokhale, the liberal political leader, and social reformer.Having crossed a bridge, to the left of which thin columns of smoke still rose from the smouldering bodies of the dead, he passed through one of those health camps, as official language fondly called them, and found before him a partly finished building of solid stone – unfinished, but with “something already monastic and grave in its straight-roofed hall and line of cloistral habitations”. It was the rising home of the “Servants of India Society”, and in front of his small house the founder and “First Member” of the Society, Gokhale, stood to receive him.On the edge of the rocky country west of Poona, close beside the Fergusson College, with which he had been so long connected, he had laid the foundation of his “Servants of India Society” two years before, and in the two-roomed cells about a dozen Knights of the Order were already living. They were men prepared, in the language of the Society’s rules “to devote their lives to the cause of the country in a religious spirit, and to promote, by all constitutional means, the national interests of the Indian people”.The object of the Society was to train the Servants as national missionaries, ready to visit any part of India at the order of the First Member and Council, in the hope of creating a deep and passionate love of the country, organising political teaching, promoting goodwill among the different races, assisting education, especially of women, and raising the people “who live below even the lowest caste”.Nevinson was dining that night with such of the Servants of India as had not gone home for the family festival. RP Paranjpye was there too – Senior Wrangler of his year, Fellow of St John’s, and then head of the Fergusson College. NC Kelkar, the editor of the “Mahratta”, and BG Tilak’s vigilant captain, who belonged to the “extremist” camp, had come as well. And a few more “Brahmans and non-Brahmans” sat with them, in a row. They did not care about the “purity” they would be sacrificing by eating beside a “carnivorous European”.That “inscrutable dispensation” was discussed amid laughter. Gokhale mentioned that the British rule had instilled into the Indian nature a love for freedom and self-assertion against authority that Indians used to lack, but “English people often possessed in enviable abundance”.Nevinson met Gokhale many times again – in Pune itself, Surat, Bombay, and London. But to Nevinson he always pictured him on that Diwali evening in the refectory where the Servants of India were gathered around him, together with friends from both the main parties of the time.Friends who did not see eye to eye on several social and political issues dined together that evening.Nevinson was allowed a table, chair, and spoon at dinner. Others sat on the floor, their backs against the walls, and in front of each of them was laid half a banana leaf, neatly studded around the edge with little piles of rice, beans, vegetables, chutney, and other condiments, laddoo, and “thin wheaten cakes”.Which when they had eaten, and drunk clean water from round brazen vessels, they washed up by burning the banana leaves, rinsed their hands, and continued the discussion over pomegranate seeds, orange cloves, and pan-leaves concealing betel-nut and various spice.Serene, modest, definite in aim and knowledge, Gokhale continued to discourse with his guests.That moonless night, Nevinson returned to the city of plague, where the oil lamps were now extinguished, and the children asleep.Chinmay Damle is a research scientist and food enthusiast.

Thus we arrested him,” police inspector Dayanand Gawade from LCB said.A diploma holder, he has knowledge in carpentry work as well and could break open the latches easily. “We have recovered 46 tola gold from him and he is currently in police custody,” Gawade said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/lab-assistant-arrested-for-11-house-burglaries-in-raigad-101636022706110.html
04-11-2021||Delhi||A costume guide for a safe Diwali||This Diwali, as you decorate your home with traditional diyas or aromatic candles, pay utmost attention to fire safety . This requires careful thinking on the location of the diyas and candles so as to prevent accidental contact with them. The design of the clothes that you wear for the occasion and the fabric that you choose, also play a part in keeping you safe.So to help you make the right choice, I have put together some essential information on the flammability of different kinds of fabrics and clothes, because we do not have laws such as those in the United States or Canada, to regulate the safety of clothes vis-à-vis their flammability . In fact even though we have statistics on fire mishaps in the country, we do not have any specific data on injuries and fatalities caused on account of clothes accidentally catching fire. However, media reports of such fire accidents caused from diyas and candles or while performing pooja or even during cooking, raise serious concerns. As it is, traditional Indian dresses require women to be extra cautious while going near a fire, but today, with fashion trends veering towards wide pants and flowing dresses, one needs to be extremely vigilant.The safety of your clothing in respect of its flammability hazard depends on five important factors -- the fibre used in the fabric; the fabric composition and construction ; the weight of the fabric; the finish of the fabric including its surface texture; and the design of the garment.The relative flammability of a fibre is determined on the basis of the minimum concentration of oxygen required to support combustion of the fabric, known as its “Limiting Oxygen Index” (LOI). Since the oxygen content of the atmosphere is about 21 per cent, all those fibres with an LOI of less than 21 per cent burn readily.Thus cellulose fibres like cotton and linen, with an LOI of 17-20 percent, ignite easily when in contact with a flame and burn rapidly and continue to burn even after taken away from the flame. However, tightly woven, thick and heavy cotton burns more slowly. Wool , a protein fibre, on the other hand has an LOI of 24-27 per cent and therefore will not ignite readily and burns very slowly. Natural silk, another protein fibre with an LOI of 23, also burns slowly and shrinks or curls away from the flame and is self-extinguishing. Comparative studies on heat transfer of fabrics also indicate that wool and silk generally do not cause severe burns.Polyester (LOI of 22 per cent) melts rather than catch fire and falls away from the flame. If it does catch fire, it burns slowly and self-extinguishes. However, because it melts, it causes deep localised burn injury . Acrylic, with an LOI value of 17-18 per cent is the most flammable of synthetic fibres -- it burns fast, produces considerable heat and worse, it melts and drips, causing deep and severe burns. Heavyweight acrylic is no better. Fabric structure matters too -- loosely woven fabric is generally far more combustible than a tightly woven fabric because of the presence of air in and around the yarn, fuelling combustion. Likewise, a lightweight cloth is far more flammable than a thicker, heavier one. The surface texture of the fabric also makes a difference – fabrics with raised fibre surface are more prone to catch fire and the flame can well travel quickly over the surface of the fabric. Chemical finishes can also alter the flammability of a textile, so also blends of different fibres..The design of the garment also plays an extremely important role here - trailing garments, flowing dresses and long and wide sleeves not only increase the chances of fabrics accidentally coming in contact with a source of fire, but such dresses burn faster because of the availability of more air between the skin and the garment. So do avoid such garments during the festival and tuck in all loose ends..In fact an observational study involving 224 persons who had sustained burns on account of their clothes catching fire, found that victims wearing loose, flowing garments such as sarees (41.1 per cent), salwar (22.3 per cent) and dupatta (9.8 per cent) caught fire easily and sustained more burn injuries than those who wore short, fitting dresses. The study, published in the World Journal of Plastic Surgery ( T.M.Honnegowda, 2019 ) also found that synthetic garments were involved in far more accidents (50.89 per cent) than cotton (20.53 per cent ) So by all accounts, wool is one of the best fabrics to wear during the festival of lights. Heavy and thick natural silk is also an option. Thick and tightly woven heavy cottons is not a bad idea too. But say no to loosely woven, light weight fabrics and most importantly, acrylic garments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/a-costume-guide-for-a-safe-diwali-101636019824794.html

04-11-2021||Kolkata||Bengal BJP asks TMC govt to slash state tax on fuel||The West Bengal BJP on Thursday stated that the Mamata Banerjee government should reduce VAT on petrol and diesel, taking a cue from the Centre, if it was serious about being pro-people.The TMC, however, termed the Centre's decision to slash excise duty on petrol and diesel by ₹5 and ₹10 per litre respectively a "mere eyewash". Describing the Centre's move as a "Diwali gift to the nation", Leader of Opposition in West Bengal Assembly Suvendu Adhikari, took to Twitter, and said, "Now the WB Govt should follow suit and slash state tax to further bring down the rates."BJP national vice-president Dilip Ghosh tweeted that the TMC government, "which claims to be pro-people", has its task cut out to reduce VAT imposed by it on petroleum products. The party's state president, Sukanta Majumdar, also made a similar demand.Claiming that the slash in excise duty is "nothing but an eyewash", TMC state general secretary and spokesperson Kunal Ghosh, nonetheless, pointed out that the meagre reduction was announced after the rates hit the roof. "They should bring down the main price component," he tweeted.The TMC leader contended that the Centre levies higher tax on petroleum products than the state and as such the reduction in excise duty wouldn't have much bearing on the Union government's exchequer. He further alleged that the Centre gives BJP-ruled states more funds when compared to those which have opposition parties at the helm."The BJP-ruled state governments get their dues from the Centre on account of the taxes it levies, but Bengal remains deprived," Ghosh said, iterating TMC's allegation that the Union government metes out a "step-motherly treatment" to the Mamata Banerjee government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bengal-bjp-asks-tmc-govt-to-slash-state-tax-on-fuel-101636014456275.html

04-11-2021||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh slashes VAT on petrol and diesel||The Uttar Pradesh government on Wednesday slashed Value Added Tax (VAT) on petrol and diesel to bring down their prices. The move came as the Centre reduced excise duty by ₹5 per litre on petrol and ₹10 a litre on diesel amid spiralling fuel prices while urging states to further bring down the rates.A state official said the reduction in the levies will overall bring down the fuel prices by ₹12 per litre in Uttar Pradesh.Chief minister Yogi Adityanath earlier indicated the reduction at a meeting on VAT on October 28. The state government imposed a VAT of 26.8% or ₹18.74 per litre, whichever was higher, on petrol and 48% or ₹10.41 per litre, whichever was higher, on diesel.No additional details about the new rates of VAT were available till late Wednesday. People aware of the matter said the rates have been brought down by ₹7 per litre on petrol and ₹2 per litre on diesel.VAT is a major source of revenue for the government, which earned ₹2200.4 crore, about 106% of the target of ₹2060.43 crore, through it in September. The earning was ₹1,653 crore in September 2020.The government earned ₹12137.27 crore as VAT in the first six months of 2021-2022, or 39% of the annual target.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uttar-pradesh-slashes-vat-on-petrol-and-diesel-101635995463648.html

On Wednesday, the average AQI was only slightly better at 314, also in the “very poor” category.The Capital city’s AQI is expected to cross 350 and be at the higher end of the “very poor” category later on Thursday, agencies forecast. While the bursting of firecrackers will not be a major contributing factor to the worsening air quality, since it is expected to be under control, stubble burning is likely to have an impact as it could pick up from Thursday. Also Read: 51% cut in stubble burning incidents this seasonIts contribution to the AQI is expected to range from 20-40 until Saturday. An increase in wind speed may give New Delhi welcome relief from Friday night onwards, with winds of 20-30 km/hr likely on Saturday and Sunday, the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) said. CPCB data shows New Delhi recorded its most polluted Diwali on October 31, 2016 when the AQI had touched 431, which falls in the “severe” category.Last year on Diwali, despite a blanket ban on firecrackers, an AQI of 414 - “severe” – was recorded, making it the second most polluted Diwali in six years.However, Diwali was marked much later last year, on November 14, by when the impact of stubble burning was at its peak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/new-delhi-wakes-up-to-an-air-quality-of-very-poor-category-on-diwali-morning-101635994803982.html
04-11-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: The place of the ‘kalaigar’||The stone floor is pockmarked with a couple of craters filled with smouldering coals. A handful of blackened steel chalnis (strainers) are flung about the place. Then there’s a stack of what appears to be dinner crockery traditional to Walled City dastarkhwans: bowls (called ghauri), katoras, chamchas, bhagonas, and jugs. Their metallic surface is sparkling with a mirror-like shine.This is a coppersmith’s workshop in Old Delhi’s Matia Mahal Bazar. “We call ourselves kalaigar,” says Faisal Qureshi. It is afternoon, and he is working with younger brother, Muhammed Faizan. “We bring out the shine in your bartan.” says Mr Qureshi in a modest tone, explaining that they accomplish this feat by applying a coat of tin on copper vessels. Wearing a check lungi and a shirt—its long sleeves rolled up to his elbows—Mr Qureshi calls himself a third generation kalaigar. “I inherited this profession from my father, Muhammed Irfan, who inherited it from his father, Haji Sharifuddin, whose father, Haji Nasiruddin, ran a meat shop.” The 80-year- old landmark is called Haji Kalaiwale.In his late 30s, Mr Qureshi is patiently responding to queries even though he is busy at work. Using a tong, he lifts off a jug from fire and plunges it into a tub filled with water. A hissing sound follows.Otherwise the workshop is snuggled in silence and darkness, in contrast to the chaos of the street outside. A biker passes by, his left arm holding a metal lunch box that is shining as brilliantly as the vessels in Mr Qureshi’s workshop. Perhaps it was given a kalaigar treatment in his place. Mr Qureshi smiles non-committally. “There are 3-4 more kalaigari shops in Old Delhi, apart from a few kalaigars who travel on bicycles.”Joining the conversation, Mr Qureshi’s brother reveals conspiratorially that their home is upstairs, “just above the dukaan.”In his 30s, Mr Qureshi says he never felt the urge to break away from his family vocation. “I might have considered it if there were no demand for such work… but we are constantly busy…. customers come from as far as Gurugram and Greater Noida.” Meanwhile Mr Qureshi’s nephew, the young school-going Hammad, is sitting by the entrance, playing a video game on the mobile. “He will be the fourth generation kalaigar,” says Mr Qureshi. The boy blushes.The “dukaan” shares its wall with Zam Zam Perfumers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-place-of-the-kalaigar-101635982546320.html
04-11-2021||Other||CPI (M) seeks arrest of BJP leader for hate speech||Jammu CPI (M) leader MY Tarigami on Wednesday demanded the arrest of BJP leader and former MLC Vikram Randhawa. He also raised questions over government inaction against him, even as stringent laws were in place to tackle such utterances. “Even after exhorting his supporters to beat up Kashmiris and skin them alive, which is an open call to violence, he has not been even arrested. In contrast, students who had reportedly cheered for Pakistan over a cricket match victory have been charged with sedition and put behind bars,” said Tarigami in a press release.On Tuesday, the J&K unit of the BJP removed Randhawa from all party posts, including that of the state secretary of the party, with immediate effect. Police have registered a case against him under Section 295-A and 505(2) of the IPC. He was seen making remarks about the way Muslims pray and about the triple Talaq. Though Randhawa has tendered an apology, his controversial remarks have not gone down well with the civil society in the UT. In May, Randhawa had tendered unconditional apology before Union minister Jitendra Singh after the latter had slapped ₹1 crore defamation suit in a Delhi court. At that time Randhawa, who is president of Stone Crushers Association in Jammu, had accused Jitendra of aiding illegal mining from the Tawi riverbed. He had also accused the then district mineral officer Ankur Sachdeva, Jammu divisional commissioner, and SSP Jammu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cpi-m-seeks-arrest-of-bjp-leader-for-hate-speech-101635971521773.html
04-11-2021||Other||Fatehpur bypoll a shot in the arm for Congress, leadership challenges remain||Dharamshala The result of the bypolls for Fatehpur assembly segment has come as a shot in the arm for opposition Congress in politically significant Kangra as it would not only galvanise its cadre, but also indicates the voting patterns in future elections.The bypoll outcome assumes significance as it depicts how a resourceful party like the BJP, despite being in power and putting in all its might, failed to wrest the seat. Alarm bells are certainly on for the BJP, with the win boosting the morale of the Congress, which is staring at a leadership crisis in Kangra. The Fatehpur seat was vacated due to the death of former Congress minister Sujan Singh Pathania in February this year. His son Bhawani Singh Pathania, who quit as a top executive in a banking and insurance company, not only won but also extended the lead for Congress.It is a popular saying in Himachal that the ‘Road to Shimla’ goes through Kangra. Merged in Himachal in 1966, Kangra sends the highest 15 legislators to the assembly.For the past five decades, the party winning the maximum seats in Kangra forms the state government. It is also true, however, that no one from Kangra except Shanta Kumar, has ever become the CM; with infighting the reasons. In 2017, BJP won 12 seats in Kangra and formed the government; in 2012, Congress won 10 seats and ruled the state.LEADERSHIP CRISIS A CHALLENGEDespite the spectacular victory, the Congress cannot afford to be overjoyed, as it stares at a leadership crisis after the death of former minister GS Bali. The question staring hard at the Congress is who will over take the reins of the party.After Bali, former minister Sudhir Sharma was a big Congress face and was seen as a future party leader from Kangra. His re-emergence remains a puzzle, after the self-created crisis of 2019, when he refused to contest the bypoll? Given the vacuum, however, the party will like him to take over. Age is not on the side of former MP Chander Kumar. The future, however, appears bright for Palampur legislator Ashish Butail; he has proved his political acumen in the Palampur municipal corporation elections, which the Congress won with a thumping majority. However, state politics is a different and he is yet an inexperienced hand here. District party president Ajay Mahajan doesn’t hold sway like his father late Sat Mahajan while former union minister Chandresh Kumari and former state party chief Viplove Thakur have almost given up electoral politics.Priyabhishek Sharma, a political analyst says, Kangra will again hold the key for the government. “Yes, the Congress stares at a leadership crisis but it may overcome the challenge and win Kangra with proper election management in 2022,” he said.Sharma added election results were a rejection of the BJP polices, so that the Congress will definitely have an edge and cash in on anti-incumbency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/fatehpur-bypoll-a-shot-in-the-arm-for-congress-leadership-challenges-remain-101635970861418.html
04-11-2021||Other||Parts of Srinagar without mobile net for hours a day, complain residents||Srinagar For over 15 days, mobile internet remains suspended for hours in parts of Srinagar, disrupting work and business. Locals say Old City Srinagar is the worst-hit and the crisis started after 11 civilian killings by suspected militants in October in Srinagar and south Kashmir districts. Even the speed of broadband internet has been slowed, residents claim.“It is as if the authorities are rationing the mobile internet like distributing government rice. For two weeks now, there is no mobile internet from 7am to 10:30pm every day,” said Sajid Ahmad, 38, a resident of Rainawari. “I also have fibre connection whose speed has reduced drastically. When we played Pakistan in the T20 World Cup match, internet was restored even later than midnight,” he said.Ahmad said that he works from home for a private company which is established outside the valley and his work was suffering. “My mail hardly loads and I am forced to do my official work through Whatsapp at odd hours. It is so embarrassing and also affects one’s appraisal,” he said, adding college students are also suffering, with some even shifting to areas where the mobile internet is normal. Besides Rainawari, areas in the heart of the Old City like Nawhatta complain of no service during the day. A shopkeeper of Nawhatta, who provides online recharge and billing services, said that his business was suffering due to the internet ban.“The internet gets snapped from 7am to 11:30am and then again from 3:30pm to 10:45pm every day. We don’t know how they do it but it affects not only us but even students who are not able to attend online classes. My business is down 70%,” said the shopkeeper, not willing to be named. A field employee of the power department said he was suffering for want of mobile internet in a large area of old city stretching from Makhdoom Sahib to Khanyar and Bohri Kadal, and extending to Eidgah belt. “No internet causes a lot of communication issues, while routine shutting down and resumption of power grids and stations,” he said. Rafiq Ahmad, a resident of Khushal Sar, also complained of the unreliable internet. Srinagar deputy commissioner Mohammad Aijaz Asad said, “You should speak to telecom companies or security people. Nobody has brought it to my attention so far.”Kashmir divisional commissioner Pandurang K Pole said he was not in headquarters. IGP Vijay Kumar did not respond to a call from HT. The IGP, however, acknowledged the suspension of internet of ‘some towers’ in a tweet on October 21. His tweet read, “Seizing some bikes and shutting down of internet of some towers is purely related to terror violences. It has nothing to do with the visit of the honourable HM (home minister),” he had said. The Union home minister had visited on October 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/parts-of-srinagar-without-mobile-net-for-hours-a-day-complain-residents-101635969661374.html

04-11-2021||Chandigarh||2015 bir theft case: SIT to grill dera chief in Rohtak jail on Nov 8||The Punjab Police special investigation team (SIT) probing the 2015 sacrilege cases will visit Sunaria jail in Rohtak on November 8 to question rape and murder convict Dera Sacha Sauda head Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh for his alleged role in the theft of a “bir” (copy of Guru Granth Sahib) from a gurdwara at Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village on June 1, 2015. People familiar with the development said the SIT will also question Ram Rahim to ascertain the whereabouts of three absconding members of dera’s national committee, who are key link in sacrilege cases. SIT head Surinder Pal Singh Parmar sent a communication to the district magistrate, Rohtak, informing that on the direction of the Punjab and Haryana high court, the members of the SIT will visit Sunaria Jail, Rohtak, for interrogating Ram Rahim on November 8. “You are requested to intimate the jail authorities accordingly so that the order of the high court may be complied with meticulously,” the letter reads. The probe team has already prepared a questionnaire on the basis of evidence on record to interrogate the dera chief. Last week, a Faridkot court issued production warrants against Ram Rahim in a case of sacrilege wherein a “bir” (copy) of Guru Granth Sahib was stolen from a gurdwara in Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village of Faridkot district on June 1, 2015. But the Punjab and Haryana high court directed Punjab Police to grill Ram Rahim in Rohtak jail itself, if it so desired, and directed the jail authorities to make arrangements for the SIT to question dera head. In July 2020, after the arrest of seven dera followers, the SIT led by former inspector general of police Ranbir Singh Khatra had named Ram Rahim and dera’s three national committee members—Sandeep Bareta, Pardeep Kler and Harsh Dhuri— as accused in the case. The “bir” was stolen from Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village gurdwara on June 1, 2015. On October 12, 2015, torn pages of that “bir” were found scattered in front of a gurdwara in the adjoining Bargari village, leading to statewide protests and death of two Sikh protesters in police firing. In its chargesheet, the SIT claimed that it was Ram Rahim who ordered to carry out sacrilege to avenge insult of sect followers by a Sikh preacher. The dera head is lodged in Sunaria jail of Rohtak since August 25, 2017. In 2017, he was awarded 20-year jail term for the rape of two disciples. Subsequently, he has been convicted in murder cases of a journalist Ram Chander Chhatrapati and Ranjit Singh, a former dera manager, in which life sentence has been awarded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/2015-bir-theft-case-sit-to-grill-dera-chief-in-rohtak-jail-on-nov-8-101635968222536.html

No reason was cited for the suspension, it is learnt. Deputy commissioner Harish Nayar had directed Dr Jatinder and Moga tehsildar Karan Gupta to collect samples with the help of police after receiving a tip-off that adulterated and substandard sweets were being sold in Moga. The DC had said in an order that it was essential to curb the malpractice since it might affect the health of people. The food safety officer alleged that he was suspended due to political pressure. The shopkeepers who were against the sample collection drive requested a political leader to get the drive stopped, he said. “The political leader verbally recommended my suspension to the state health department. We started the drive around 3:30pm that lasted for about four hours. A total of 8 samples were collected. But around midnight, I received order of my suspension on WhatsApp with no reason mentioned. In the morning, I came to know that a political leader from Moga had recommended my suspension on the shopkeepers’ request seeking to discontinue the drive.” “I only did what the administration asked me to do. I have explained to the health department that I was just acting on the DC’s order,” he added. Deputy commissioner Harish Nayar said he was not aware about the suspension order. Moga civil surgeon Dr Amarpreet Kaur Bajwa said, “We were not informed about the reasons for Dr Jatinder’s suspension by the department.”Commissioner (food and drugs administration) Kumar Rahul, who issued the order of Dr Jatinder’s suspension, did not respond to repeated calls and messages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/moga-food-safety-officer-suspended-at-midnight-hours-after-sample-collection-drive-101635968161057.html
04-11-2021||Chandigarh||2015 sacrilege cases: Punjab DGP reconstitutes SIT||Punjab director general of police (DGP) Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota has reconstituted the special investigation team (SIT) probing the 2015 sacrilege cases by appointing Batala senior superintendent of police (SSP) Mukhwinder Singh Bhullar as its new member. AIG, counter intelligence, Rajinder Singh Sohal and commandant of 27th battalion, PAP, Jalandhar, Opinderjit Singh Ghuman have been dropped from the probe team. The order reads that in the interest of administrative exigencies, the SIT has been re-constituted. “Batala SSP Mukhwinder Singh (who replaces Ghuman), DSP Lakhbir Singh and inspector Dalbir Singh will be the members of the SIT headed by inspector general of police Surinder Pal Singh Parmar,” he added. After the retirement of Khatra in April, Parmar, in a letter to director bureau of investigation recommended that DIG Gurpreet Singh Bhullar may be nominated as a member of the SIT. The profiles of eight DIG-rank officials — Babu Lal Meena, Baljot Singh Rathore, Gurpreet Singh Bhullar, Hardial Singh Mann, Harbaj Singh, Gurpreet Singh Toor, Surjit Singh and Gurpreet Singh Gill — were scrutinised for nomination as a new member. However, Bhullar’s name was not forwarded at that time. Last month, the DGP formed a four-member team for a “special operation”’ for tracing three absconding members of the Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda’s national committee, who are accused in sacrilege cases of Guru Granth Sahib in 2015. The orders were withdrawn after a day following backlash. The decision to form a new team caused consternation among officers as it was being seen as an attempt to undermine the power of the SIT led by Parmar. DIG Gurpreet Singh Bhullar was asked to supervise that team, while AIG Rajinder Singh Sohal was among the other four members. But now, Sohal has been dropped from the team. The SIT is probing three FIRs registered in connection with sacrilege incidents, including theft of a “bir” (a copy of Guru Granth Sahib) from Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village in Faridkot district on June 1, 2015, putting up of derogatory posters at Bargari village on September 25, 2015, and torn pages of the “bir” found scattered at Bargari on October 12, 2015.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/2015-sacrilege-cases-punjab-dgp-reconstitutes-sit-101635968042703.html

04-11-2021||Chandigarh||Diwali: Two-hour window to burst green crackers in Panchkula||Following in the footsteps of Mohali, the Panchkula administration has allowed only a two-hour window for bursting green crackers on Diwali. Panchkula district magistrate Vinay Pratap Singh, who issued the orders on Wednesday, said residents can burst green crackers from 8pm to 10pm on Thursday. He said the sale and use of other fire crackers is banned in compliance with a letter issued by the State Disaster Management Authority, Haryana, adding that area-wise teams have been constituted to enforce the order. In Mohali, too, following the Punjab government’s directions, residents are allowed to burst only green crackers for two hours, 8pm to 10pm, on Diwali. The administration has issued just 40 temporary licences for the sale of crackers across the district.Meanwhile, the Chandigarh administration on October 12 imposed a banket ban on the sale and use of crackers after extensive consultation with health and environment experts, and has refused to give any relaxation despite petitions from cracker traders.2,750 cops to enforce orders across tricityAround 2,750 police personnel in addition to administrative officials will keep vigil to enforce these orders across the tricity. Residents can also call on 112 for reporting any violation.The Panchkula district magistrate said that air pollution poses serious environmental risks with adverse effects on the health of people, particularly vulnerable sections like children, elderly and people with pre-existing respiratory illnesses. As many as 1,000 cops will enforce the orders across the district. The district magistrate said violators will be booked under the Disaster Management Act 2005 and Section 188 (non-compliance of prohibitory order) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).In Chandigarh, too, anyone caught selling or bursting crackers will be booked under Section 188 of the IPC and relevant sections of the Disaster Management Act. Section 51 of the Act provides for a jail term of two years in case anyone gets hurt and one year for mere violation, while Section 188 entails a jail term up to three months. To ensure strict compliance, different teams of Chandigarh Police, comprising over 600 cops, have been deployed. About 42 floating nakas will be set up in different parts of the city from 4pm till late at night. In Mohali, the district police have intensified patrolling, especially on the routes leading to religious places and markets. As many as 1,150 cops in uniform as well as civvies will be on duty, and the violators will be booked under Section 188 of the IPC, said senior superintendent of police Navjot Singh Mahal. Day before Diwali, air quality turns very poor Air Quality Index (AQI) went up to 318 at the monitoring station in Sector 22, Chandigarh, around Wednesday noon. It stayed the “very poor” bracket for about two hours before falling into 100s once again. As the AQI at the other continuous ambient air quality monitoring station in Sector 25 remained under 100 (satisfactory) throughout the day, the officials are calling the spike at Sector 22 an “anomaly”.Ruling out the role of stubble burning, Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee member secretary Debendra Dalai said: “Since the AQI went back into 100s in just a couple of hours, it was most likely an anomaly. Any spike due to stubble burning or temperature changes would have kept the AQI high throughout the day.” Dalai said the AQI on an average was a bit higher on Wednesday due to vehicular movement amid festive rush. The Chandigarh administration has imposed a blanket ban on the sale and use of crackers to combat pollution.According to government agencies, an AQI within the range of 0-50 is regarded as good, 51-100 is satisfactory, 101-200 is moderate, 201-300 is poor, 301-400 is very poor and 401-500 is severe. If “very poor”, the polluted air can cause respiratory illness on prolonged exposure.Meanwhile, clear and dry weather is likely to continue in the city, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD). In the next three days, maximum temperature will remain around 30-31°C and minimum temperature around 13°C.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/diwali-two-hour-window-to-burst-green-crackers-in-panchkula-101635967869343.html

Another worker whose condition is critical was shifted to the PGIMER on Wednesday.While the authorities pointed to suspected fire-safety violations at the unit, the owner blamed the deaths on the delay in the fire department’s response.Also read: Factory owner booked for negligence that led to three deathsAmong this blame game, it’s the poor families who have been left to suffer. First, they lost their family members and now they had to wait an entire day to get the bodies.At 9 pm, which is over 30 hours after the death of her mother, a teenage girl dressed in school uniform was seen sitting in a pitch-dark area outside the police post. “Please give me my mother’s body. I have to take her to our native village for the cremation,” pleaded Neha, who hasn’t eaten anything since morning.Sonali Devi, who has left behind two children and a husband, was working in the factory for over 2 years. On the day of the fire incident, she was cleaning the furniture.Her father Sat Narayan said: “We are running from the pillar to post since morning. In the hospital, they ask us to get some documents from the police. Here the police are not giving us anything in writing. I only want my wife’s body and if someone can arrange a van so that I can take the body to the village.”Inderjeet Rana, the husband of deceased Mamta, said: “I am a diabetic patient and remain unwell. I have lost my wife and we are being harassed since 6 am. No one is listening to us. They have not registered any case yet.

The court also awarded 20-year rigorous imprisonment to co-accused in the case.Special district government council Sant Pratap Singh said it was the second death sentence awarded by the court in Bahraich within two months. Singh said the court, in its 123-page judgment, found the crime to be ‘rarest of the rare case’ and thus awarded death sentence to one of the main offenders.Giving details about the case, the additional superintendent of police (rural) Asokh Kumar said a 12-year-old girl, a resident of Rehuwa village, was found murdered on April 10, 2021. An FIR was lodged under sections 364, 376 and 302 of the IPC based on a complaint made by the victim’s father Santosh Singh against unidentified persons on April 11, 2021. During the investigation, two persons Phool Chand Kannaujiya, 32, and Roshan Lal, 30, were convicted for the rape and murder of the minor girl.Additional Sessions Judge Nitin Pandey awarded death sentence to Phool Chand Kannaujiya, and 20-year rigorous imprisonment to co-accused Roshan Lal added special district government council.

04-11-2021||Chandigarh||80% decline in farm fires in Ambala this year||Even as neighbouring Punjab is recording higher stubble burning cases of 2021 in recent days, Ambala district recorded almost an 80% fall in farm fires this year.As per the data available, the cases fell from 702 between 15 September and 30 October last year to just 146 in the same period this year. The decline is significant as the other rice-producing districts of the region are way behind.For instance, Karnal witnessed a mere 24% decline in cases, Kaithal saw 29% fall and 47% fire incidents decreased in Kurukshetra. However, Yamunanagar performed well with a decline of 75% fire cases of kharif crop this year. Deputy commissioner Vikram said due to concentrated efforts that started in June, much before the cultivation season, the target was achieved easily. “As many as 499 awareness camps were held at village level to sensitise 20,000 farmers and a large Kisan Mela was organised at Behbalpur village on October 6 to educate farmers about ill-effects of burning stubble. Providing in situ and ex situ stubble management is also among steps taken,” the officer said.A team headed by an SDM was also constituted in each sub-division to look into the stubble burning cases. “The team reaches the AFL spot to douse the fire and take appropriate action. This also led to a feeling among the villagers that the vigil is strong,” the DC said.The administration marked nine villages in the red zone, where more than six cases were reported last year and 89 villages were designated in the yellow zone, where the fire incidents reported were between one and five.Hitesh Kumar, SDM (City), under whose jurisdiction most villages were in the red zone, said special camps and programmes were organised in these villages so that numbers of fire incidence come down to zero.“Eleven officials of the agriculture department from other districts were sent to these villages to inform farmers and make availability of the appropriate machinery to the farmers,” he said.The efforts were also appreciated by several farmers in the district who are against stubble burning. Naveen Kumar, a peasant from Mullana village in Barara sub-division, who will use the in situ management on 2.5 acres of his crop, said his fellow villagers were also benefiting from the initiatives and were also scared that anyone could complain to the police if they burn stubble.His counterpart in Bhanokheri, a village under the red zone, Dimple, also agrees but believes that the subsidised amount should reach farmers at the earliest.The administration has so far collected a total fine of ₹1,07,500, where 41 farmers were challaned at ₹2,500 per two acres and beyond, but no FIR was lodged against any of them.Girish Nagpal, deputy director of agriculture, said till October 30, 146 satellite locations were identified by HARSAC, Hisar, and six physically, while no fire was found at 110 sites during field verification.The decline in cases is evident with the AQI levels dropping from the “poor” to “moderate” category this year. The average air quality levels of October 2020 remained at 226.13, while in the same period this year, the levels were recorded at halfway mark at just 133.Other than fewer fire cases, this was also possible due to irregular rainfall several times in the month, Nitin Mehta, regional officer, Haryana State Pollution Control Board, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/80-decline-in-farm-fires-in-ambala-this-year-101635967741055.html

During an appearance in the court of Mansa judicial magistrate in a drug recovery case, Karamjit Singh of Patiala district’s Balamgarh village submitted an application claiming torture in the jail. He alleged that jail superintendent Balbir Singh along with constable Jagroop Singh and other jail staff inscribed ‘attwadi’ on his back on Tuesday. “I was punished for raising my voice against the jail authorities for violating basic rights of inmates,” he claimed. Poor quality food is provided to the inmates in the jail, he said. “No doctor or pharmacist is available in the prison during night and inmates have to wait for long hours in case of medical emergency. The products at jail canteen are sold at higher rates and VIP treatment is provided to some inmates after taking bribes,” he said seeking action against the jail officials. He also showed the inscribed mark on his back to the judicial magistrate who forwarded the matter to the Barnala chief judicial magistrate. Barnala jail superintendent Balbir Singh said no such incident took place in the prison. “This is a completely false allegation. This has been done under a conspiracy by Karamjit who got the word inscribed with the help of other inmates. Besides his conviction, he is facing trial in 11 more cases, including that of murder and attempt to murder. He was upset after we put his aides in separate barracks. Why would we inscribe something on his back and take him to the court next day?” he asked. ‘Conduct a thorough probe’ Deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa on Wednesday issued an order to conduct a thorough probe into the alleged Barnala jail incident. Randhawa, who also holds the prison portfolio, directed additional director general of police (jails) PK Sinha to get medical examination of the prisoner done.Sinha said DIG Ferozepur range Tajinder Singh Maur has been appointed as the investigating officer for the case and will visit the jail on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/barnala-jail-officials-inscribed-terrorist-on-his-back-alleges-murder-convict-101635967561375.html

04-11-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana farmers say Parmal varieties more profitable due to assured MSP||Haryana farmers who had grown premium paddy variety, Basmati are staring at financial losses after a sudden fall in prices in the open market.The prices of aromatic Basmati in the mandis have come down to around ₹3,600-3,800 per quintal against last year’s ₹4,500-5,000 per quintal. The premium Basmati varieties were grown in Kaithal, Karnal and Kurukshetra districts and harvesting is at its peak.Farmers said they are not selling their produce as they expect a rise in the prices after Diwali.“I have harvested my crop on three acre and harvesting is still on. I have not sold it yet because at this price, I will not be able to get any profit,” said farmer Raghubir Singh of Karnal’s Nilokheri.Another farmer Krishan Kumar, who has nearly 30 acre Basmati crop in Sakra village of Kaithal district, said, “There is no stability in the prices of Basmati since the past couple of years. The prices keep fluctuating and causing huge losses to farmers.”Parmal more remunerative than BasmatiGovernment agencies procure only Parmal varieties on the minimum support price (MSP) while the long-grained Basmati varieties are purchased by private traders. There is no stability in the prices of Basmati varieties.Farmers said those who had grown Parmal varieties have earned more profit as they could sell their produce on MSP of ₹1,960 per quintal. Even early and high-yielding varieties of Basmati, including Pusa 1509 and Pusa 1121, also fetched good prices and were sold at around ₹3,000 per quintal.“The average yield of Parmal varieties remain above 30 per quintal and farmers earn well but the yield of premium Basmati remains 12-14 quintal and at the present price, farmers will not be able to get ₹50,000 per acre,” said rice trader Praveen Kumar.Need pricing policyPeople associated with the rice industry have blamed the lack of a proper pricing mechanism for the Basmati varieties for their losses. They said due to lack of pricing policy for Basmati, farmers are left with no choice but to sell their produce at the prices fixed by private traders.Former president of the All-India Rice Exporters Association, Vijay Setia said the fluctuating acreage of Basmati varieties caused instability of prices.“Last year, prices of Basmati varieties were good. Following this, farmers had shown interest in traditional Basmati cultivation this year. That is why, this year, the prices had crashed as traders cannot purchase beyond their stock limits and demand,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-farmers-say-parmal-varieties-more-profitable-due-to-assured-msp-101635967326963.html

Abhishek (23) of Sirsa district in Haryana died after a heavy object fell on him and another worker at an under-construction building on the refinery premises in the afternoon. The second worker, Jaskaran Singh who sustained critical injuries, is undergoing treatment at a private hospital. Both were hired by an outsourcing private company, which is carrying out construction work at the refinery. The protesting workers alleged that safety measures were not followed by the private firm due to which the carpenter died. Later, when the Talwandi Sabo and Raman station house officers (SHOs) rushed to the spot, their vehicles were set on fire. Heavy police force was rushed to the spot. After bringing the situation under control, the district police carried out a flag march in the area near refinery.

The government had declared this as a ‘national disaster’, as it had struck two-three weeks before normal. “We have started providing compensation to affected farmers. Over 12,000 families or parties would be compensated in the worst-hit district,” Shopian additional deputy commissioner, Mushtaq Ahmed Simnani, told HT. On Tuesday, the government had claimed that it was for the first time in the district when farmers would get crop damage compensation well on time. “After assessing damages all across the district, a detailed report with a compensation component was submitted for its early release,” the government said in a release, adding that Simnani emphasised upon revenue and other officers to work in coordination with the horticulture department. “He asked them to speed up their activities so that the process of compensation is geared up on a war-footing basis and the farmers will be able to get the compensation of their damaged crops,” the statement said.Last week, J&K Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha had announced farmers who suffered losses in the recent snowfall will be provided assistance. The early snowfall in Kashmir on October 22 and 23 put thousands of farmers in misery as the snow damaged fruit laden apple orchards, particularly in the Pir Panjal region of Shopian and Kulgam in south Kashmir. Farmers says 40-50% of their crop was still hanging on the trees, when the snow hit Horticulture director Ajaz Ahmad Bhat who visited apple orchards in south Kashmir had said on Sunday that their initial analysis estimated around 30% of fruit crop had been damaged.Before the snow, the horticulture department had issued an advisory to fruit growers in Kashmir, asking them to speed up apple harvest. Farmers, however, could not speed up harvesting owing to political turmoil in the region. Thousands of non-locals laborers, which have been an important labour component for the Kashmir farmers, have left the valley after a series of attacks by suspected militants left 11 civilians dead, including five non-local labourers and street vendors.Kashmir is India’s largest apple grower with an average annual production of nearly 2,200 metric tonne.

They are distraught over the lack of a law on “kirpan” as it is curtailed due to security concerns, while Pakistan’s constitution guarantees freedom of religion, reported The Express Tribune.Adult Sikhs usually carry a 4 to 5-inch kirpan, kept in a sheath, which can be worn under or over the clothing. The “kirpan” amongst other things symbolises the struggle against injustice and is an integral part of the religion.The Sikh community of the province has been pushing for legislation to be allowed permission to carry the kirpan when they visit government offices, enter the court or police station, and during air travel, reported The Express Tribune.Ranjeett Singh, a minority member of the provincial assembly, has been the most vocal about such legislation ever since he was not allowed to carry the steel sword in the provincial assembly.Ranjeett, while talking to The Express Tribune, said: “When I enter the assembly, I am often asked to leave my sword outside due to which it has to be kept in my car or briefcase.” He said that being told to not carry the sword was hurtful to his religious sentiments.The provincial lawmaker is not alone. Baba Gurpal Singh, a Sikh social worker from Peshawar and a minister for minority affairs in the youth assembly, KP, shares his pain over the curtailment on kirpan.“Guru made five things obligatory for us and to not be allowed to do one is distressing,” he said.Gurpal, narrating a story about the freedom to carry the sword in other countries, said, “A few years back, I went to Malaysia and visited their parliament there but no one even asked whether I was wearing a kirpan or not.”He implored that it was high time legislation was enacted so that the 45,000 Sikhs in the province were not deprived of their religious freedom.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/khyber-pakhtunkhwa-sikhs-seek-law-allowing-them-to-carry-kirpan-in-public-places-101635967142705.html

The response came on a plea of the former CM and his son Raninder Singh that they filed on September 8 challenging the Ludhiana court order allowing the ED to inspect files pertaining to income tax cases against them in a Ludhiana court. The high court on September 8 had stayed the September 2 order observing that the I-T department’s complaint is based on information received under the convention with the French government and there are restrictions on the sharing of the same. So prima facie, the ED would not be entitled to the information in view of the apparent legal bar, it had observed. On Amarinder’s argument that there is an agreement with France as per which information on income tax could only be shared with persons or authorities involved in the assessment or collection of taxes and not with any other party, the I-T department said the treaties referred by him do not create any vested right in his favour and that the issue was not raised in the revisional court and cannot be raised for the first time in the high court. The department has also referred to the high court rules on inspection of court records. The revisional court had identified the rules on the basis of which inspection of court files could be allowed, the department said. The department had filed criminal complaints against Amarinder and his son in 2016 in a Ludhiana court, saying the two were beneficiaries of foreign assets maintained and controlled through business entities and also of foreign bank accounts maintained with a bank in Geneva. The department had also alleged that they made false statements. The department accused them of tax evasion and allegedly amassing wealth in other countries. It was in this case that the ED had moved an application seeking inspection of files in a FEMA violation case being probed by the agency. The matter has been adjourned for January 19. The ED is yet to respond to the plea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/amarinder-singh-has-no-right-to-claim-confidentiality-of-documents-in-fema-violation-case-i-t-dept-to-hc-101635966844312.html

Political leaders have criticised the development. An official of GO First airline said that from Tuesday the airline changed its route to avoid the Pakistani air space.“It is true that we have to avoid the airspace of Pakistan now. It has increased the time of the flight by around 45 minutes. Earlier it took around 3 hours 30 minutes; now we take 4 hours 15 minutes for the journey,” said an official of the airline. “It will obviously increase costs, but for the time being we are in the wait-and-watch mode,” the official added. At the inauguration, Shah had said that he hoped that the flight would help in boosting tourism and bring more investment in the UT.Srinagar International Airport director Kuldeep Singh said that the flight was having good response from people. “People are enthusiastic over this flight and mostly the airline has a full occupancy. We are following all Covid protocols,” he said, refusing to comment on the refusal of airspace by Pakistan and the use of a longer route.While official sources said that since the inauguration, there were four flights –to and fro – every week. But now there is a new schedule as per the director. “According to the new schedule, a flight will be leaving for Sharjah everyday and back,” he added.Former J&K chief minister and National Conference vice-president Omar Abdullah termed the airspace refusal by Pakistan unfortunate.“ Very unfortunate. Pakistan did the same thing with the Air India Express flight from Srinagar to Dubai in 2009-2010. I had hoped that @GoFirstairways being permitted to overfly Pak airspace was indicative of a thaw in relations, but alas that wasn’t to be,” he said in a tweet.People’s Democratic Party president Mehbooba Mufti criticised the Centre for not doing the groundwork before the start of the flight. “Puzzling that the Government of India (GOI) didn’t even bother securing permission from Pakistan to use its airspace for international flights from Srinagar. Only PR extravaganza without any groundwork,” she said.It was in 2009, when the first international flight took off from Srinagar Airport to Dubai after being inaugurated by UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi. But the optimism did not last long as all international flights were grounded owing to various reasons, including objections by Pakistan over using its airspace.After the Srinagar-Sharjah flight’s inauguration, Omar had flagged the issue of how Pakistan had refused to allow its airspace in the past.“Regarding the Srinagar-Sharjah flight that has been announced today - has Pakistan had a change of heart & allowed flights originating from Srinagar to use its airspace? If not then this flight will die the way the Srinagar-Dubai flight died during UPA2,” he said on October 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pak-refuses-airspace-use-for-srinagar-sharjah-flight-route-gets-longer-by-45-minutes-101635966601037.html

The court has convicted seven of the 12 persons booked by the police in the case. Jassi’s mother Malkiat Kaur Sidhu and uncle Surjit Singh Badesha, who were declared proclaimed offenders (POs) in 2003, were extradited from Canada in 2019. Malkiat Kaur’s counsel Simrandeep Sandhu said that Mithu’s cross-examination was completed in the court of additional district and sessions judge Smriti Dhir.“We argued that the incident did not happen in the way the prosecution was claiming it to be. We also tried to debunk the conspiracy theory,” said Sandhu.Mithu’s counsel Raj Kumar Goyal said the defense had nothing concrete to argue in the court. “The next hearing has been fixed on November 22 when other witnesses will appear in the court,” said Goyal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/2000-jassi-killing-cross-examination-of-victim-s-husband-mithu-concludes-in-sangrur-court-101635966420896.html

Now, Class 9 students will answer the multiple-choice questions (MCQ) on OMR sheets while they will answer the descriptive questions as usual on answer-sheets, informed UP Board officials. This system has been made effective from 2021-22 academic sessions, said UP Board secretary Divyakant Shukla while confirming the move. According the officials, now the question paper of 70 marks for the written examination has been divided into two parts. “The first part of the question paper will have multiple-choice questions of 20 marks which students will have to answer on the OMR sheet. While the second part will have descriptive questions of 50 marks which students will have to answer on conventional answer sheets,” they said. In these question papers, questions related to higher-order thinking skills will also be included, they further said. UP Board secretary has already sent instructions in this regard to all the district inspectors of schools (DIOSs) on November 2. According to the annual calendar released by the Up Board on August 14, the half-yearly examinations will be held in November and the annual examinations will be held in February 2022. UP Board secretary said that all DIOSs have been instructed to convene a formal meeting of principals of the UP Board affiliated schools in their respective districts, to ensure that the half yearly, annual and pre-board exams are held in accordance with the annual calendar of the board. A sample OMR sheet has also been sent along with the missive to the DIOSs in this regard, he added. UP Board officials, however, made it clear that no changes have been done in marks distribution for the half yearly and annual/pre-board exams of class 11 and class 12, and these would be conducted as done last year. The change is just for class 9, they clarified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/up-board-exams-now-class-9-students-to-answer-multiple-choice-questions-on-omr-sheets-101635966301002.html

The diyas were lit on both sides of the River Gomti by officials and employees of LMC along with the citizens of the city. The beauty and grandeur of both the banks was a sight to behold as the diyas lit up a large area.The arti of River Gomti was performed by Ashutosh Tandon and mayor Sanyukta Bhatia. More than 2,500 litres of oil, more than 20 kg of camphor and around 10 kg of cotton was also used for lighting the cow dung diyas.Speaking on the occasion, minister Tandon said, “This Deepotsav is being organised on the occasion of Diwali to ensure global recognition to Swadeshi products and to pomote the sales of street vendors.”Mayor Sanyukta Bhatia said, “Last year, we decided to make diyas from cow dung produced by cows in Kanha Upvan, for the first time. Now this experiment is successful, we hope that cow dung diyas will dominate the market in the days to come.”A number of people watching Depotsav were seen capturing the historic moment in their mobile phone cameras.District magistrate Abhishek Prakash, municipal commissioner Ajay Kumar Dwivedi, additional municipal commissioner Abhay Pandey, additional municipal commissioner Pankaj Singh, leader of BJP in LMC house Rajneesh Gupta ‘Bobby’ were present on the occasion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/deepotsav-in-lucknow-gomti-s-banks-bedecked-in-brilliance-of-1-lakh-diyas-101635965225453.html
04-11-2021||Delhi||Anticipating Diwali injuries, Delhi hospitals reserve beds, staff||Hospitals across Delhi have earmarked beds, kept staff on standby, and added counters to receive people with burn injuries, expecting an increase in such cases on Diwali, which will be celebrated on Thursday.Doctors said that there could be a higher number of burn cases this year as compared to last year.“Last year, there were very few burn cases, most likely because of Covid-19. There was a high number of Covid-19 cases being reported in November. However, this year we expect the number of burn cases to be higher than last year. Each year, we treat around 40 Diwali-related burn injuries,” said a senior doctor from Lok Nayak Hospital. The hospital has earmarked 40 beds in the emergency department for burn injuries.At Safdarjung Hospital, the entire burn unit as well as additional nurses have been asked to report for duty on Thursday. “We have created four additional counters to receive burn emergency cases,” said a senior doctor from the hospital.At All India Institute of Medical Sciences across the road, doctors from the surgical department have been posted to the emergency department for Diwali night. “We have posted more people from the surgery department to the emergency department to take care of burn patients. In addition, we have also stocked up on medicines and consumables needed for treating burn cases. We have to be prepared even though the number of burn injuries has reduced over the years, especially after the Supreme Court’s cracker ban,” said a senior doctor from the hospital.He added that since the Supreme Court’s order in 2017, which banned the use and sale of toxic crackers, the four major government hospitals that receive the highest number of burn patients in the national Capital--Lok Nayak Hospital, Safdarjung Hospital, RML Hospital and GTB Hospital--have seen a 51% decline in the number of burn cases even before the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/anticipating-diwali-injuries-delhi-hospitals-reserve-beds-staff-101635964981031.html
04-11-2021||Delhi||Don’t link crackers with religion: Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai||Equating bursting crackers with playing with the lives of people, Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai on Wednesday asked political parties to not weaken the government’s fight against air pollution by linking firecrackers with religion.The minister said each and every citizen had the right to breathe clean air, and asked residents to support the fight against pollution by only lighting diyas during the festival. He also asked people to join the Delhi government for its Diwali celebration at the Thyagaraj stadium on Thursday. “There are many issues to do politics on and the people of Delhi have given the opportunity to everyone, to do politics on work. But my request is to let people breathe,” said Rai, adding that the whole of Delhi had fought the fight against air pollution together, due to which the air in October this year was the cleanest in the last few years. “If we were to look at the pollution statistics of the past five years, it is for the first time that pollution levels are this low a day before Diwali. According to the criteria of the air quality index, the month of October saw an average AQI of 284 in 2017, 269 in 2018, 234 in 2019, and 265 in 2020. But this past month, in 2021, the average AQI was 173. There are two reasons for this reduction – first the weather, secondly the people of Delhi for helping the government fight against pollution,” Rai said. The environment minister also asked the Central government on Wednesday to issue an advisory banning stubble burning in the neighbouring states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh: “At least on the occasion of Diwali, the practice could be stopped so people could celebrate the festival in a relatively cleaner air.”Referring to the government’s anti-firecracker campaign, Rai said so far, more than 13,000 kgs of firecrackers had been seized from markets and individuals, with 33 people arrested so far. “Diwali is a festival of happiness, but people are still bursting crackers in secrecy. Even last year, we observed that many people had secretly distributed firecrackers due to their stubbornness. I appeal to everyone that in this fight for Delhi, if everyone has fought together and the weather has favoured us enough to have the lowest pollution levels in five years, please cooperate in making it a clean Diwali too,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dont-link-crackers-with-religion-delhi-environment-minister-gopal-rai-101635964806830.html
04-11-2021||Delhi||Many call for resuming physical classes as DU declares open book exams||With Delhi University preparing to conduct another round of open-book examination (OBE), starting November 30, students and teachers once again highlighted the need to resume in-person classes and exams at the earliest. Teachers said OBE raised concerns of dilution of course work assessment and it was time to go back to the usual exam mechanisms, in view of the improved Covid-19 situation in Delhi. According to the exam notification issued last week, DU will conduct the open book examination for third, fifth and seventh semester students from November 30.Abha Dev Habib, who teaches physics at Miranda House, said teachers were unhappy with the decision to conduct an open book examination and have approached the registrar with suggestions of holding in-person exams. Habib said offline exams could have been announced for third-year students followed by second-year students. “Had proctored exams been announced, students could have focused more on studies. The third-year undergraduate students have appeared for only one in-person exam — the first semester exams before the pandemic. We are looking at a very diluted degree course for students in the absence of proctored exams. The absence of exams has eroded the whole idea of education. Students are finding refuge in OBE and not studying,” said Habib. She said examinations for school students in the senior grades were also taking place in in-person, but the same mode was not being adopted for college students. “With a diluted degree, employment chances of students will be affected. Students should wake up to this reality and insist on pen and paper exams,” said Habib. She said the continued closure of colleges was unfortunate and despite suspension of in-person classes for a prolonged period of time, there was no blueprint on the resumption of in-person teaching. Arshed Aziz, 23, a final-year postgraduate student of sociology at Delhi School of Economics, said there were apprehensions that the absence of exams would hurt the future academic and employment prospects of students. “There is a popular consensus that if we don’t give offline exams, our degree will not be valued. We will not be considered for higher education opportunities,” said Aziz. He said online exams were fraught with challenges of connectivity issues and communication gaps, which hindered the whole test process. “In my department, around 12 students did not receive the results of the second-semester exams which were held online,” said Aziz. Other students said resumption of offline exams did not make sense at a time when they were completing the semester in the online mode. Nitika Dabas, 20, a final year student of BSc Zoology at Ramjas College, said students were not prepared for an offline exam as yet. “While we understand the importance of both in-person classes and exams, conducting offline exams for a semester that was taught online will not be fair to students. There are students who don’t have access to the internet and could not attend classes regularly,” said Dabas. She said most students were waiting for in-person classes, but the university has not given any directions regarding that. “We are worried about the impact that the absence of offline exams will have on jobs. We don’t even have much practical experience. It is a bit frightening since we are aiming for a research degree in the future,” said Dabas.DU’s dean of colleges Balaram Pani said the university was awaiting guidelines from the government and would aim to restart in-person classes and exams from the next semester. “Right now, the semester was taught online. If exams are conducted in-person, students living outside Delhi would face difficulties with regards to accommodation,. For the next semester, we can hold the semester sessions and exams offline,” said Pani||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/many-call-for-resuming-physical-classes-as-du-declares-open-book-exams-101635964805594.html
04-11-2021||Chandigarh||Govt schoolteacher in Ludhiana held for molesting at least 20 students||An English teacher of Government Middle School, Boothgarh Jattan village, has been arrested for allegedly molesting around 20 girl students. The matter came to light after a Class-6 girl, who was allegedly molested last week, told the other girls about the incident, following which, they revealed that they too had been sexually assaulted by the teacher. The accused allegedly used to call them on the pretext of extra classes or by asking them to get him a glass of water and then assault them.The FIR has been lodged on the statement of the grandmother of the girl who was molested last week. The woman said that her 10-year-old granddaughter had been molested by the teacher. When she went to the school to complain, the principal told her that the teacher had already left for the day and that she should come the next week. On Monday when she went to the school again, the parents of the other girls also reached there. It was later found that the teacher had been threatening the girls to keep mum by stating that he would get them expelled from the school if they revealed the incident to anyone. Assistant sub-inspector Raghbir Singh, the investigating officer, said police arrested the accused within hours of the complaint. The accused has been booked under Sections 354 (assaults or uses criminal force to any woman), 354-A (sexual harassment) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 10 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/govt-schoolteacher-in-ludhiana-held-for-molesting-at-least-20-students-101635964744335.html
04-11-2021||Delhi||Crackdown in Capital on crackers as AQI stays in red zone||The air quality in the national capital worsened on Wednesday, stoking fears of a severe uptick in pollution levels on Diwali day amid concerns that widespread violations of the firecracker ban may plunge Delhi into a health emergency, even as Delhi Police flying squads fanned out across the city to crack down on the sale and use of crackers.The average 24-hour air quality index (AQI) at 4pm was 314 on Wednesday, up from 303 a day earlier, with both readings in the “very poor” range.Experts warned that emissions by firecrackers, if unchecked, could exacerbate already unfavourable meteorological conditions — including slow winds and below-normal temperatures, and the impact of stubble fires in neighbouring Haryana and Punjab.On Wednesday alone, police teams across the city seized around 1,200 kg of firecrackers smuggled in from Dehradun and Gurugram, among others, and arrested at least six people for storing and selling the contraband. However, it was not immediately clear if there have been any arrests yet for bursting crackers in Delhi.“Around 4.30pm on Wednesday, you could see a cloud of smoke and dust circling over northwest India, including Delhi, and Pakistan. Expect air quality to get worse in the region. The forecast says that the level of PM2.5 (particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) is likely to remain in the 120-250ug/m3 range,” said Pawan Gupta, a research scientist at the Goddard Earth Sciences Technology and Research (GESTAR), Universities Space Research Association. In India, the acceptable 24-hour exposure to PM 2.5 is 60ug/m3. An AQI between 301 and 400 is considered “very poor”, and one between 401 and 500 is “severe” — the point at which the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) pollution gauges max out. The city’s AQI breached the 300-mark on Tuesday for the first time this season.In the backdrop of these warnings, the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) and senior Delhi Police officers held a series of meetings to minimise the sale and use of firecrackers in the city.The Delhi government in September this year — as it did in 2020 — ordered a blanket ban on the sale, use, and storage of all firecrackers till January 1 next year, citing their severe health effects, especially amid the pandemic and the toxic pollution levels. The ban goes a step further than a Supreme Court verdict in 2017 that banned all traditional crackers across the country but permitted barium salt-free “green crackers”.CPCB data shows that Delhi recorded its most polluted Diwali day (October 31) in 2016, when the AQI touched 431 (up from 404 the previous day). Last year, despite a complete ban on firecrackers, an AQI of 414 (up from 339 a day earlier) made it the second most polluted Diwali in six years amid widespread violations. To be sure, Diwali was celebrated later than usual last year — November 14 — a time when stubble fires are at their peak.In a meeting with the sub-committee of the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in the National Capital Region on Wednesday, representatives of the central weather office pointed out that while Delhi is likely to receive easterly winds till November 4, they will mostly be sluggish till Saturday and not conducive to disperse pollutants in the city’s air. After that, winds are likely to switch direction and blow in from the northwest, bringing in toxic smoke from stubble fires in the farmlands of Haryana and Punjab.The India Meteorological Department (IMD), however, predicted that pollution levels are unlikely to hit “severe” levels yet based on weather conditions.“The AQI is likely to deteriorate marginally on November 4, and is likely to reach the upper limits of the ‘very poor’ category on November 5 and 6. Around this time, the winds will switch to northwesterly, which will also bring smoke from stubble fires from Punjab and Haryana. Even with higher emissions, the model predictions do not indicate the air quality reaching the severe zone. Strong winds are forecasted for November 7,” VK Soni, head of IMD’s environment and research department, told the CAQM’s sub-committee.Prashant Gargava, chairperson of the CAQM sub-committee on the implementation of the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) and member-secretary of the CPCB, said the panel has not suggested any additional measures to curb pollution levels, since they are not expected to hit severe levels. The sub-committee has, however, asked agencies to implement measures listed under Grap’s “very poor” category, which was implemented on October 28.And even as the district deputy commissioners of police (DCP) and DPCC coordinate their efforts to tackle the pollution menace, the police are also working with sub-divisional magistrates and sharing information on the illegal sale of firecrackers. HT on Wednesday reported that a black market for firecrackers had sprung up in the Capital, which could allow people to evade the restrictions.Delhi Police officers said they had a two-pronged approach to crack down on cracker-bursting this Diwali season: To coordinate with residents across the city and inform them about the guidelines of the ban, and to have in place flying squads within a police station’s jurisdiction to spot violations and prosecute violators. “One team will work as a flying squad to act on any information where people are violating the ban on crackers. The strength of the team will depend on the population of the police station area. They will be especially active in the evening,” said a senior police officer, who asked not to be named.Meanwhile, Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai urged people to not link religion and cracker-bursting.““There are many issues to play politics with... but my request is to let people breathe,” said Rai.BS Vohra, president of the East Delhi RWA Joint Front — an umbrella body of resident welfare groups — said that the police and other agencies need to build awareness among residents. “Change has to be behavioural; if that doesn’t happen then these bans won’t be successful. Along with penalising, the police needs to work on sensitising people and tell them the impact of cracker-bursting,” he said. Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana said, “Police are prepared and made all arrangements to implement the order. Detailed guidelines to follow the orders have already been issued.”Last year on Diwali, the police seized at least 1,206kg of firecrackers and arrested 850 for their store or use. This year, in the run-up to Diwali, police have seized over 3,000kg of smuggled firecrackers and arrested at least 12.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/crackdown-in-capital-on-crackers-as-aqi-stays-in-red-zone-101635964740833.html
04-11-2021||Noida||Man held for opening fire at neighbour over children’s dispute in Greater Noida||A 45-year-old man was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly opening fire at his neighbour, who allegedly slapped the former’s son, in Sector Beta 2 on Tuesday afternoon. The suspect was identified as Vijay Pal, a resident of Senior Citizen Society in Greater Noida. Police said Pal works as an advocate in the Allahabad high court. Anil Kumar, station house officer of Sector Beta 2 police station, said on Tuesday evening, Pal’s 11-year-old son was on his way to a tuition class when he spotted a 10-year-old boy in his neighbourhood bursting firecrackers. “Pal’s son told the younger boy that his firecrackers were small. The younger boy took offence at his comments and this led to an argument between the two,” said Kumar. Police said Pal’s son allegedly slapped the younger boy, who went home and informed his parents about the incident. The younger boy, along with his parents, went to Pal’s home and complained to him about his son’s behaviour. After they left, Pal scolded his son and asked him to behave himself. Pal’s son suspected that the neighbourhood boy and his family must have complained about him to his father. On Wednesday morning, Pal’s son visited the younger boy at his home and asked why he complained to his father about the incident. Police said, this time the younger boy’s father, Girish Kumar, allegedly slapped him. “Pal’s son returned home and told his father that he was beaten up by Girish Kumar,” said the SHO. Pal took out his licensed revolver and visited Girish Kumar’s home. “After a heated argument with Girish Kumar, he opened fire and Girish Kumar narrowly escaped being hit. Girish Kumar alerted police about the incident, following which police reached the spot and arrested Pal,” said SHO Kumar. Police said they retrieved a gun and three live cartridges from Pal’s possession. A case has been registered against Pal under sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 307 (attempt to murder) of the IPC. “The suspect was produced in court and sent to jail,” said SHO Kumar. Police have also recommended cancelling Pal’s weapon licence for its misuse. A separate case under Section 30 (punishment for contravention of licence or rule) of the Arms Act has been registered against him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/man-held-for-opening-fire-at-neighbour-over-children-s-dispute-in-greater-noida-101635964680769.html
04-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Dengue deaths likely to go up as 9 cases still pending panel review||The dengue death toll in the national capital is likely to go up further as nine cases of suspected dengue deaths, of Delhi residents, are still pending investigation before the death audit committee, a senior municipal public health official said on Wednesday. So far, Delhi has declared six confirmed dengue deaths — the highest since 2017 when the disease claimed 10 lives. Of these, five were declared on Monday (November 1), the weekly report released by the city’s municipal authorities showed. Delhi reported 531 new cases of dengue during the week ending October 30, taking the Capital’s dengue tally to 1,537 this year. Of these, 1,196 cases were reported in October, while 531 were registered in the last week alone, the weekly report further showed.A senior official, who is part of the audit panel, said the committee has to analyse nine cases of suspected dengue deaths of Delhi residents, and 10 of those who had arrived in Delhi from neighbouring states. Once a dengue or malaria related death is reported by a hospital, the nine-member committee audits all case documents to ascertain whether it was the vector borne infection that caused the death, and also to find out if the origin of the disease was Delhi. “The committee will take a look at other aspects such as co-morbidities before attributing the deaths to vector borne diseases. For example, if a patient is severely ill due to other conditions and the main cause of death is not dengue, then the death is not attributed to the mosquito-borne disease. The number of dengue deaths is likely to go up as several such cases have been sent to the committee,” the municipal official said, on condition of anonymity.There was only one dengue death in Delhi last year, two in 2019 and four in 2018, according to official data. In 2015, a major dengue outbreak had killed 60 people. With the rise in dengue cases and higher number of deaths, the leader of the house in the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) Inderjeet Sehrawat said special focus is now being given to areas with a high number of cases. “A three-day long fogging and anti-mosquito drive is being undertaken in every neighbourhood that has a high incidence of dengue/malaria cases,” Sehrawat said. Apart from Delhi’s tally of 1,537 so far, there are another 1,257 dengue cases, wherein the infection was acquired from other states. Some of these patients have their addresses missing, according to the weekly report issued by the three municipal corporations on Monday. “A large number of dengue patients from western Uttar Pradesh (UP) districts are coming in Delhi for treatment,” the official quoted above said. East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) mayor Shyam Sunder Aggarwal said intensive fogging and larvicide spraying drives are being carried out in hot spots where there is a high incidence of dengue cases. “A separate ward with 160 beds has been set up in Swami Dayanand hospital to treat dengue patients as we are getting a large number of cases from western UP,” he said. EDMC has identified 16 hot spots and they include Maujpur, Dharampura, Nand Nagri, West Karawal Nagar and Timarpur, among others. The SDMC has prepared a list of 27 such vulnerable hot spots. Under the Najafgarh zone, the vulnerable spots include Palam Village, Dwarka’s Sector 23 and 12, Raj Nagar, Rangpuri Pahari, and Mahipalpur village; in the south zone, the hot spots include Gautam Nagar, Hauz Rani, Malviya Nagar, Dakhsinpuri, Sangam Vihar and Pushpa Vihar. “Under the west zone, the hot spots identified by the SDMC are Uttam Nagar (Jiwan Park, Pankha Road and Mohan Garden), Mahavir Enclave, R-Block Raghubir Nagar, Madipur JJ colony and AB block Janakpuri,” a public health official from the civic body said, not wishing to be named. The hot spots under the central zone include Jaitpur, Ali Vihar, parts of Badarpur, Govindpuri and Tughlaqabad extension, the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhidengue-deaths-likely-to-go-up-as-9-cases-still-pending-panel-review-101635964442139.html

The list was released by the university recently.Out of eight scientists who figure on the list are three from AU’s department of biochemistry including Prof SI Rizvi, Prof Bechan Sharma and Prof Abhay Pandey, two from department of Botany including Prof SM Prasad and Prof DK Chauhan and one each from the department of Material Science (Prof Ravindra Dhar), K Banerjee Centre of Oceanography (assistant professor Sudhir Singh) and department of Chemistry (Prof MC Chattopadhya), AU officials said.The report was prepared by Prof John PA Loannidis of Stanford University and his team and published by Elsevier. In all, 3,352 Indian researchers found a place in this list that represents the valuable impact of India on the global research platform, said AU’s dean, research and development, Prof SI Rizvi while confirming the development.Prof Rizvi added that the inclusion of eight faculty members on the coveted list is a big achievement for AU which is grappling with a huge number of vacant faculty positions.The University is preparing an environment conducive to research, and the researchers are being given high class facilities to carry out their work in cutting edge research areas. To give impetus to research the university has instituted two prestigious awards: the Dronacharya award to be given to a faculty member of the rank of assistant professor) and MN Saha award for the best research scholar in Science and Humanities. The two awards will be announced during the convocation in front of the education minister, said Rizvi.Despite the decrease in the strength of faculty members, the research output of the university is exemplary. Data from SCOPUS shows that the citation impact of research papers published from Allahabad University is 0.99. The world average value is 1. This data shows that the quality of research at Allahabad University is at par with world standards.The number of research papers published (indexed in Scopus) from Allahabad University during the period 2016-20 is 1,728, and the H-index of the University is 39 which is very good, informed the dean, research and development.The recent achievement of Allahabad University scientists will certainly be inspiration to young faculty members and research scholars, added Prof Rizvi||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/stanford-list-of-world-s-top-2-scientists-eight-au-researchers-figure-on-us-varsity-s-list-101635964440877.html
04-11-2021||Noida||Noida, Ghaziabad get second best pre-Diwali air in four years||The prolonged monsoon and its late withdrawal from northern India have helped Ghaziabad and Noida record the second best pre-Diwali air quality in the past four years. This year, the average monthly air quality index (AQI) before Diwali is 230.27 for Ghaziabad and 200 in Noida, the figures from the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB), showed.According to the state pollution control board, the month preceding Diwali was the cleanest in 2019 in the past four years. Data from the UPPCB showed that the average AQI for the month preceding Diwali was 198.6 in Ghaziabad and 193.57 in Noida in 2019.Both cities experienced its worst pre-Diwali month in 2020 when the monthly average AQI stood to 354.93 in Ghaziabad and 343.03 in Noida, the highest in the four years since 2018. “The pollution levels this year have increased a bit as compared to the monthly average AQI before Diwali in 2019. Diwali was celebrated on October 27 in 2019, right after the monsoon withdrawal. Hence, stubble burning was not at its peak and AQI readings were better in the run-up to Diwali that year,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer for UPPCB, (Ghaziabad), who is also officiating for Noida.  “This year, the pre-Diwali period in Ghaziabad and Noida region is the second best in the last four years. For the past couple of days, stubble burning has increased and so has the emission from vehicles as markets have opened up after permission was granted for festivities following a drop in Covid-19 cases. All these factors have led to a minor rise in pollution as compared to 2019,” said Sharma. When it comes to air quality, Noida has fared better than Ghaziabad during the one month preceding Diwali in all four years. An AQI reading between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”. As pollution levels continue to rise in Ghaziabad, the city emerged as the most polluted city in the country for the third consecutive day on Wednesday according to the AQI figures released by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). Ghaziabad recorded an AQI of 353 (very poor) on Wednesday, with the primary pollutant being particulate matter (PM)2.5, which are fine particles with a diameter less than 2.5 micrometres. This is mostly the result of stubble burning and vehicular pollution. The AQI for Greater Noida stood at 286 under the “poor” category. Noida too had “very poor” air on Wednesday with an AQI reading of 327. The PM2.5 was the primary pollutant at two monitoring stations in Greater Noida and at three monitoring stations in Noida on Wednesday. Environmentalists said the economic activity during the festive season started late this year. Thus, it is leading to a rise in AQI in the region. “Rise in pollution in Ghaziabad and Noida is largely due to meteorological factors and also due to higher vehicular emissions during the festive season. The enforcement lacks sting. If the average of pre-Diwali AQI is second best in past four years, it is not due to enforcement but due to prolonged monsoon which ended just last month,” said Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist. “In the coming days, the level of pollution is likely to rise as bursting of crackers has already started in localities despite the administration not issuing any licences for firecrackers. The post-Diwali period will reveal the true picture of air pollution, hence the enforcement agencies need to act now,” said Sushil Raghav, a city-based environmentalist.According to the System of air quality and weather forecasting and research (Safar), the AQI of Delhi will start deteriorating from November 4 to touch the upper end of “very poor” range on November 4. “As per the Safar sensitivity simulation, stubble share on November 4 is predicted to increase to 20% and will touch a peak of 35-40% on November 5 and 6, if fire counts are considered same as today (3500-4000)... In addition, very calm local Delhi wind condition with little ventilation is expected for next three days. Under zero firecracker emission scenario, the level of PM2.5 is predicted to be at the upper end of ‘very poor’ during November 4-6,” the forecast said. It predicted that if 50% of additional fire cracker load of 2019 is considered, then AQI is predicted to enter “severe” category during November 4-6. “It is predicted to improve slightly on November 6 evening onwards but will fluctuate between high-end of ‘very poor’ to the ‘severe’ range. This is mainly due to coinciding of all three critical factors with a peak PM2.5 surpassing AQI value of 500+ on November 5,” the forecast said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-ghaziabad-get-second-best-pre-diwali-air-in-four-years-101635964382713.html
04-11-2021||Delhi||At least 1,100 kilos of crackers seized on the eve of Diwali||At least 1,100 kilograms of firecrackers, which were smuggled into the city from parts of Uttarakhand and Haryana, were seized from across the city, over the past 24 hours, by different teams of the Delhi Police. In the first major seizure of crackers this year, a joint team of the Delhi Police and the Delhi government on Wednesday seized 879 kilos of firecrackers from a godown in north Delhi’s Sadar Bazar, one of the biggest wholesale markets for crackers in the national capital. Police also seized an additional 294 kilos from Karkardooma and 32 kilos of crackers from Babarpur in north-east Delhi on Wednesday.The sale, storage and bursting of firecrackers have been banned in the national capital to keep air pollution under check and prevent it from deteriorating further. A day before Diwali, Delhi’s air quality index (AQI), as recorded by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), was 314, in the “very poor” category. Over the past one week, police have seized more than 3,000 kilos of firecrackers from different parts of the city. Most of the contraband has been smuggled in from states where there is no ban on the sale or storage of crackers, police said, adding that some shopkeepers were also trying to sell crackers that they had stocked last year. In 2020, licences were issued to several retailers after which they had stocked up on firecrackers. But just days before Diwali, the government imposed a ban on the sale of firecrackers, leaving retailers holding on to stocks that they could no longer sell. In at least three instances this year, police have arrested shopkeepers for trying to sell this year-old stock to customers. In places such as Sadar Bazar, Chandni Chowk and Bara Hindu Rao, where there are wholesale markets for firecrackers, police are conducting frequent surprise checks and even sending police personnel as decoy customers. Police are also randomly stopping shoppers for bag checks. On Monday, seven such shoppers were caught with 77 kilos of firecrackers. Speaking about the seizure of 879 kilos of crackers from a godown in Sadar Bazar, deputy commissioner of police(DCP), north district, Sagar Singh Kalsi said the arrested suspect, Mohammed Izaj, sells toys from a pavement in Sadar Bazar. “ He is originally from Bihar and was working as a labourer initially. Later, he started selling toys from the footpath. He came in contact with a Hisar resident, who promised him easy money by selling crackers. He also took a room on rent to store the crackers, which he had purchased from Hisar, Haryana, and ferried to Delhi in two different vehicles.”Because of the blanket ban on crackers, Delhi Police is filing cases under the more stringent sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Explosives Act. In the second case, four persons were arrested from Arya Nagar village near Karkardooma for allegedly smuggling 294 kilos of firecrackers and trying to sell them in Delhi. Police said the four men, including a 53-year-old shopkeeper, bought the firecrackers from Gurugram, Haryana, and were planning to sell them in the city.Another shopkeeper was arrested from Babarpur in north-east Delhi for allegedly smuggling in 32 kilos of the contraband from Dehradun, Uttarakhand. DCP (north-east district) Sanjay Kumar Sain said police have arrested suspect Amit Mittal,36, in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/at-least-1-100-kilos-of-crackers-seized-on-the-eve-of-diwali-101635964331165.html
04-11-2021||Delhi||Crackers or not, air quality in Delhi likely to continue downward slide: IMD||Slow winds, a change in the wind direction, drop in temperatures and high humidity -- weather conditions conducive for slow dispersal of pollutants -- will ensure very poor air quality in Delhi on the occasion of Diwali on Thursday even if people do not burst firecrackers, weather scientists have said.According to India Meteorological Department (IMD), from Thursday, the wind direction will change to northwesterly which will bring more particulate pollutants from the farm fires in Punjab and Haryana. On Wednesday, the overall contribution of a total of 3,271 stubble fires to the pollution in Delhi was recorded at 8%. According to System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), a forecasting body under the Union ministry of earth science, this contribution may go up to 40% on Thursday.RK Jenamani, scientist at IMD, said temperatures are currently staying near normal, and will remain in the same range for the next few days, but calm wind conditions are expected on both November 4 and 5. There will be high humidity too. Jenamani, however, predicted that things may improve Friday night onwards. “Relief is likely only from the night of November 5 and the morning of November 6 onwards. Wind speeds will pick up and touch 30 km/hr and help disperse pollutants,” Jenamani said.On Wednesday, ahead of Diwali, a meeting of the sub-committee on the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) was also held during the day, with experts warning of air quality deteriorating to the higher end of the ‘very poor’ category between November 4 and 6. However, no fresh directions were issued.Tanushree Ganguly, programme lead at the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), said forecasts by Safar, Urban emissions and Delhi’s new air quality decision support system (developed by IITM) all suggest air quality will be in the higher end of the ‘very poor’ category on Diwali, even if crackers were not used.“If people burst firecrackers, we may see ‘severe’ air -- levels of air pollution which especially impact the health of children, elderly, and those with existing health problems. Delhi’s forecasting systems have a clear message for all of us. If we want to protect the health of our family and neighbours, we must refrain from using firecrackers,” said Ganguly.According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data, air quality in Delhi last month remained uncharacteristically decent till October 26. However, from October 27, the air quality stayed in the poor zone till November 1. On November 2, the city recorded AQI in the very poor zone for the first time since the last 146 days. On November 3, the air stayed in the same zone, indicating it may worsen further.To be sure, the Delhi government has imposed a complete ban on sale, storage and use of firecrackers with teams being formed to ensure that people do not violate the rules on Diwali.On the eve of Diwali on Wednesday, Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai urged the citizens to shun firecrackers, asked political parties not to link cracker bursting with religious traditions and appealed to the Centre to issue and advisory to the neighbouring states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to stop stubble burning.Polluted Diwali, a normCPCB data shows Delhi recorded its most polluted Diwali day in 2016, when the AQI touched 431 (severe) on October 31. In 2020, despite a complete ban on firecrackers, an AQI of 414 (severe) on Diwali day made it the second most polluted Diwali in the last six years. Last year, Diwali was celebrated on November 14.Around the festival, the impact of smoke from farm stubble burning is usually at its peak, the effect of which is amplified by the low temperatures and emissions from firecrackers.Over the last two years, weather has come to Delhi’s rescue during Diwali. While pollution levels have spiked on Diwali night and the day after, strong winds and rain have helped disperse the cracker smoke.In 2020, despite recording the worst pollution spike on and post-Diwali because of an increase in cracker bursting, heavy rain and strong winds the day after, helped clear the pollution levels in the city. On November 14, Diwali day, the AQI hit 414. A day later, it increased further to 435. But by November 17, the AQI had improved to 171.“A western disturbance crossed the national capital on Diwali night last year, which led to an increase in the wind speeds. Though the impact was not seen immediately in the next day’s data because it is a 24-hour average, the AQI in the next few days reached the moderate level,” a senior Met official said.In 2019 too, high wind speeds helped disperse the cracker emissions quicker than it had in 2018, environment experts pointed out. That year, Diwali was celebrated on October 27.“The dispersion of pollutants was as fast as the build-up. This is because of the stronger winds compared to 2018 ,” an analysis by Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) that year said.While there was a complete ban on firecrackers last year, only green crackers were allowed in 2018 and 2019 – with violations being reported in both years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/crackers-or-not-air-quality-in-delhi-likely-to-continue-downward-slideimd-101635964140755.html
04-11-2021||Noida||Noida authority forms panel to ensure completion of 13 projects by this year||The Noida authority has formed a committee which will monitor the ongoing projects and expedite the works to ensure the projects are completed within the stipulated deadline. The deadline for completing most of the projects are in November and December, said officials. “The committee will regularly monitor the ongoing projects and fast-track the works,” said Rajiv Tyagi, chief general manager of the Noida authority. Deputy general manager S P Singh, who is heading the Noida traffic cell, has been made head of the committee. The committee will conduct inspection and find out the reasons for which projects are getting delayed. “If they find that some technical or other issues are delaying the project, they can seek help of top officials and resolve the issue,” said Tyagi. At least 13 important projects in Noida are in the advanced stages of work and the authority’s priority is to deliver these projects by November or December end. One of the major projects includes an underpass being constructed at a traffic intersection of Sectors 71/72 and 51/52 at an estimated budget of ₹59.33 crore. Noida authority officials said it will provide much needed relief to thousands of commuters, who face congestion at this point since the work was started and the traffic was diverted into a service lane.Other projects included a mini stadium in Sarrafabad for ₹54.16 crore, development work in the industrial Sectors 145, 151, 158 at ₹39.59 crore, an entry gate at Noida-Greater Noida border for ₹4.99 crore, and an entry gate between Sector 157 and 159 for ₹1.6 crore. All these projects are expected to be completed by November end. Apart from this, the authority has also decided to complete seven projects, estimated to be around ₹463 crore, by December end before the model code of conduct comes into effect in view of the state assembly elections in 2022, said officials. These projects include a bus terminal in Sector 82 for ₹204 crore, three underpasses on Noida Expressway for ₹204 crore, resurfacing on Noida Expressway for ₹ 61.54 crore, a cow shelter near Sectora 15-A for ₹7.12 crore and an entry gate at Kalindi Kunj Delhi-Noida border estimated to cost ₹ 2.72 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-authority-forms-panel-to-ensure-completion-of-13-projects-by-this-year-101635963963603.html
04-11-2021||Delhi||Day after platforms collapse, SDMC repairs auto parking lot, cops file FIR||A day after a section of platforms in the city’s first automated parking lot at Green Park collapsed, the South Delhi Municipal Corporation claimed its technical team repaired them on Wednesday.Meanwhile, the Delhi Police registered an FIR to investigate the negligence which led to the accident.Deputy Commissioner of Police (south) Benita Mary Jaiker confirmed police have registered a case under sections 326 and 427 of the Indian Penal Code. “We have filed the FIR suo motu and have started a probe,” she said. Four platforms in the Green Park facility allegedly malfunctioned due to a technical fault during a maintenance operation around 5.30pm on Tuesday, leading to minor damage to at least two vehicles and the facility temporarily halting operations.SDMC mayor Mukesh Suryan has ordered a probe to investigate the reasons behind the malfunction. He said that if the private company operating the facility is found to be at fault then it will be blacklisted. Suryan said that the parking lot has been fully functional for the last 11 months. “The operation and maintenance of the entire parking facility have been the responsibility of the agency which constructed the whole parking lot for the past five years. During the upkeep and maintenance of the parking lot on the evening of November 2, an empty pallet of one tower got displaced from its position. The empty panel struck a lift and fell onto two other empty pallets. Since the parking system is fully mechanical, no loss of property or human life was reported. Our technical team reached the parking lot and made the parking facility operational,” he said.HT, on Wednesday afternoon, witnessed Delhi Police at the site, while some users waited to retrieve their stranded vehicles.Users said the accident negatively impacted the perception of the automated facility. Rajender Gaur, who was waiting to retrieve his vehicle from the lot, said that no one would be willing to risk using the automated parking lot even if there was a minor risk to the safety of their vehicles. “My relative was visiting the Green Park market on Tuesday when the incident took place. He informed me. I have been waiting to retrieve my vehicle since this morning. Such accidents do not inspire confidence,” he remarked.Atul Goel, the president of URJA (United Residents’ Joint Action)-- a collective body of residents’ welfare associations-- said that the automated parking units have been functional in the western countries for a long time and the accident reflects poor maintenance or lack of regulatory framework.“Either there has been negligence, or safety norms have not been followed, or the quality has been compromised in operations. This is not a small thing. There is already a trust deficit with the agencies and unless a proper third-party independent audit mechanism is set up, such projects will remain under-utilised,” Goel said.SDMC has so far opened three such automated units during the last year at Green Park, Lajpat Nagar, and Adchini, while several more such facilities are in the pipeline at GK-1, GK-2, Amar Colony, Nizamuddin, Punjabi Bagh, and Sarai Kale Khan.Dr S Velmurugan, chief scientist, Central Road Research Institute (CRRI) said that automated parking systems are a proven trusted technology and the accident could have happened due to poor workmanship or maintenance-related issues. “It will make people apprehensive about using such facilities. Such snags or mechanical failures can be detected if the facility is frequently monitored and monthly audits are carried out. There should be third-party audits on a monthly basis or independent electrical engineers should be made part of the auditing team,” he added.Sewa Ram, professor of transport planning, School of Planning and Architecture, said that people usually prefer surface parking despite a higher parking cost, and accidents like the one in Green Park can be a setback to the safety perception of automated facilities. “This accident seems like the first of its kind in Delhi. The technology has been in use for a long time in developed countries. Only a probe will indicate whether a mechanical or structural fault caused the accident. A thorough safety audit and safety assessment should be carried out and a fail-safe backup mechanism should be put in place to avoid a repetition in the future. Already, studies have shown that the occupancy of multilevel parking lots is low and people prefer to park on the surface,” he added..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-south-civic-body-repairs-green-park-automated-parking-lot-cops-register-fir-101635963901947.html
04-11-2021||Noida||Eight CCTV cameras installed at Noida-Ghaziabad border||The Gautam Budh Nagar police have installed eight CCTV cameras at Tigri roundabout, which connects Greater Noida West to Ghaziabad’s Vijay Nagar, to keep a tab on any suspicious movement in the border area, officials said on Wednesday.The night vision cameras will help in crime prevention, the officials said, adding that a control room that will work 24x7 has been set up. Harish Chander, deputy commissioner of police, Noida Central, said that thousands of vehicles pass through the Tigri border every day from Greater Noida West to Ghaziabad and vice versa. “The cameras have been installed in a way that they clearly capture the vehicles in all four directions. The cameras can catch the vehicles’ registration numbers at night also. We have also set up a control room where four police personnel monitor the area in shifts,” he said.Anita Chauhan, station house officer, Bisrakh police station, said there are instances when thieves and other criminals commit crime in Noida and flee to Ghaziabad. “These cameras will play an important role in identifying such suspicious persons. We have also installed loudspeakers at the spot which can be used for public announcement, when needed,” she said. Residents said that the move is important for their safety. “The Tigri roundabout is about 1.5km from Gaur City. The Noida police and Ghaziabad police have their check posts near the roundabout. However, there are instances when incidents take place and the two district police pass the buck on each other. The CCTV cameras will facilitate the process and also help screen the suspicious persons and vehicles,” said Amarjeet Rathore, a resident of Gaur City in Greater Noida West. The district police also started a police check post in industrial area in Ecotech 3 on Wednesday. Chander said that the check post is set up at Akash Beban Chowk. “This will play an important role in the safety of industrial sites in the neighbourhood,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/eight-cctv-cameras-installed-at-noida-ghaziabad-border-101635963840983.html
04-11-2021||Delhi||Farm fires till Nov 2 half of those reported last year: CAQM||The incidents of farm fires in parts of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Delhi reported between September 15 and November 2, just about halved this year compared to the same period last year, according to the data provided by the Commission for Air Quality Management in Delhi-NCR and adjoining areas (CAQM).The data shows that 21,364 stubble burning instances were reported between the period this year compared to 43,918 fires -- a drop of 51.35%. Correspondingly, the contribution of farm fires to the overall pollution in Delhi has stayed up to 20% this year so far, even though experts have warned that it may see a spike soon.If the CAQM data is juxtaposed with the average air quality data provided by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), it can be seen that Delhi’s AQI has stayed mostly in the moderate and satisfactory zone between September 15 and October 26. To be sure, this included three poor air days on 16, 17 and 20 October; and an unprecedented good air day on October 18. However, since October 27, the air quality stayed in poor or very poor zone.Farm fires are a major contributor of the particulate pollutants to Delhi’s air during the winters when thousands of farmers across Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh set the stubble on fire after harvesting the paddy.“To curb and abate air pollution from stubble burning, the commission has prepared a detailed framework and pursuant to that, action plans have been finalised by the government of Punjab, NCR state governments and the government of Delhi,” the CAQM said on Wednesday.The commission also pointed out that this season, the major hot spots of paddy residue burning in the state of Punjab were Tarn Taran, Amritsar, Firozpur, Patiala, Ludhiana and Kapurthala. In Haryana, maximum stubble fires were reported from Kaithal, Karnal, Kurukshetra, Fatehabad, Ambala and Jind.“This season, 8,575 fields where stubble burning was reported, have so far been inspected by the state enforcement agencies and officials of the respective states and environmental compensation (EC) of about Rs. 58,05,000 has been imposed on violators,” the statement by CAQM said.It added, “Concerted efforts are being taken by the state governments, departments and various other stakeholders towards better in-situ management of crop residue through the use of CRM (crop residue management) machinery, PUSA bio-decomposers and facilitating various options for ex-situ utilization of paddy straw, besides large number of IEC (information, education and communication) activities, educational campaigns, awareness camps and publicity through print, electronic and social media.”The CAQM said that the air quality in Delhi was comparatively better this time compared to last year. “The hazy layer is fog and not smog as is being mistaken. There is comparatively less smoke and pollution share in the air now,” the statement said.Environment experts said that while the efforts of the commission and the government agencies were in the right direction, it was also important to note that this year because of a late monsoon withdrawal the stubble fires started late and the spike has only started from October-end.“Between September 1 and November 2, over 18,747 and 4,842 farm fires were spotted in Punjab and Haryana. Yesterday (Tuesday) alone, more than 2,500 farm fires were reported in Punjab and Haryana. As we are in peak stubble burning window, fires are likely to go up to 3000-4000 per day in the coming days. While the current share of stubble burning on Delhi’s particulate levels is less than 10%, it is expected to reach 35-45% on November 5 on account of northwesterly winds,” LS Kurinji, programme associate, Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW).She added, “Furthermore, since Diwali coincides with the peak stubble burning window this year, forecasts suggest that the additional load from firecrackers could further deteriorate the air quality in Delhi NCR. Taking cues from these forecasts, cities in the Indo-Gangetic Plain should execute pre-emptive measures controlling emissions from local sources in advance to avert severe air quality conditions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/farm-fires-till-nov-2-half-of-those-reported-last-year-caqm-101635963722155.html
04-11-2021||Delhi||Man steals ₹4.5 lakh from employer, tries to flee Delhi, nabbed||A man who stole around ₹4.5 lakh from his employer was arrested from Anand Vihar bus terminal on his way out of the city. Deputy commissioner of police (south west) Gaurav Sharma said police have recovered around ₹4.40 lakh from his possession, while the suspect , later identified as Prabhakar Saket, bought shoes and clothes with the remaining money. Saket was fleeing to his village in Rewa, Madhya Pradesh, at the time of his arrest, police said. DCP Sharma said Saket’s employer, Bhupinder Kumar, filed a complaint against him, alleging that the man had stolen around ₹4.5 lakh from him.

04-11-2021||Kolkata||JMB operative arrested near Kolkata specialised in forging ID cards: Official||KOLKATA: A suspected operative of the Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) was nabbed on Tuesday by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) from South 24 Parganas district’s Subhasgram village about 30 kilometres south of Kolkata, officers aware of the developments said.The man, identified as Abdul Mannan and suspected to be a Bangladeshi national, was arrested from a one-room accommodation he rented in a slum area two years ago. His neighbours told NIA officers that they had no reason to suspect that Mannan could be working for terrorists. He used to leave in the morning and return at night, the neighbours said.The NIA did not make any official statement on Abdul Mannan’s arrest till Wednesday evening. Officers said he used to provide forged Indian identity cards and documents to JMB sleeper cell members of whom three were arrested in July this year from Haridevpur in the southern outskirts of the state capital by the special task force (STF) of the Kolkata Police. The three JMB members, Naziur Rahman Pavel, Mekail Khan and Rabiul Islam, are Bangladeshi nationals. “They were living in a rented room in Haridevpur after illegally entering India. Naziur Rahman was the local leader of the group,” said an officer who did not want to be identified. The JMB operatives were working for Ansar Ali Hriday, who was jailed in Bangladesh two years ago on charges of committing robberies to raise funds for terror activities. He was siphoning part of the money to India to run his private business, the STF found during the probe. These intelligence inputs were shared with NIA.Lalu Sen alias Rahul Sen, the alleged Indian link of Ansar Ali Hriday, was also arrested in July. Although Ansar Ali’s whereabouts are not known to security agencies, interrogation of the suspects has exposed a well-organised cell which the JMB refers to as markaz, which, in Arabic, means centre.Investigation revealed that Ali used to send money to India through hawala operators apparently keeping other JMB leaders in Bangladesh in the dark. This money was invested in several businesses that have Indian partners, the agencies have found.“Ali also runs a human trafficking racket that has sent Bangladeshi men to several European countries. For this, the JMB needed forged documents such as Aadhaar cards. Mannan is suspected to be one of the key players in this forgery. He may have had other roles also,” an officer said on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/jmb-operative-arrested-near-kolkata-specialised-in-forging-id-cards-official-101635961860436.html
04-11-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC rejects Sam D’Souza’s pre-arrest bail plea||The Bombay high court (HC) on Wednesday rejected the anticipatory bail application of Sam D’Souza who claims to have only facilitated the meeting between panch witness Kiran Gosavi and Pooja Dadlani, the manager of Shah Rukh Khan, to help release Aryan Khan in the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) cruise drug bust case. D’Souza had approached the HC, apprehending his arrest by the special investigation team (SIT) of the Mumbai Police. The SIT has been set up to probe the allegation of extortion against NCB officers and others. In his application moved before the vacation bench of justice SP Tavade, D’Souza through advocate Arun Rajput has stated that as he is the only earning member of the family he should be served a notice of three working days before any coercive action is taken against him. While the bench asked Rajput to state his client’s case and keep the late hour in mind, Rajput tried to tell the court that his client was not arraigned as an accused by the SIT in its probe as Aryan and others had got bail and there were allegations against NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede. The court then observed that as D’souza had not approached the sessions court first, his application was rejected. Sam D’Souza has stated in his application that both Gosavi and Prabhakar Sail, the bodyguard of Gosavi, are frauds and the main conspirators in the alleged extortion case against NCB officers being investigated by the Mumbai Police SIT. The application stated that when he realised that Gosavi and Sail were frauds, he ensured that an amount of Rs50 lakh which Dadlani had allegedly paid was returned to her through her husband. D’Souza has further stated that Wankhede had no role in the alleged deal attributed between him and Gosavi by Sail. In an affidavit filed last month, Sail alleged Gosavi had asked D’souza over the phone to strike a deal of Rs25 crore with Dadlani for releasing Aryan Khan. Sail had alleged in the affidavit that the duo had agreed to settle the deal at Rs18 crore, of which Rs8 crore would be paid to Wankhede. In the ABA, D’Souza has stated that Sunil Patil had called him and told him that two persons, Gosavi and Manish Bhanushali, would call him for contacts with the NCB. Thereafter, Gosavi called him on October 1 and said that he was leaving from Ahmedabad for Mumbai and the next day Gosavi said that he had contacted NCB officers. D’souza has further stated that on October 2, he was at Taj Presidency at Fort when Patil called him and informed him that some influential person had been arrested for drugs and wanted D’Souza to verify the name of the person. The application stated that he then went to Green Gate with an associate in a Toyota Innova Crysta car but did not know who the influential person was. There Gosavi and Bhanushali thanked him for helping them connect to NCB officials and also informed him that the influential person arrested was Aryan Khan. The application further stateD that Gosavi informed D’Souza that Aryan was innocent and did not have any drugs in his possession and as he wanted to help Aryan, D’Souza should contact Dadlani. Thereafter, D’souza contacted Dadlani through a mutual friend, a hotelier and met her at Lower Parel in the early hours of October 3. When Dadlani who was along with her husband said she was the decision maker, D’Souza introduced Gosavi and Dadlani. “Kiran Gosavi showed her a list in which Aryan Khan’s name was not present and said that he can help Aryan get out of this situation. Gosavi and Dadlani were discussing and we were asked to stay away because they were confidential and scared to speak in public and hence, we were not part of any discussion that happened between them,” claimED the application of D’Souza. The application further states that on October 3 when he saw the viral photo of Gosavi with Aryan and news reports stated that Gosavi was a fraud he called Patil who told him that Giosavi had taken ₹50 lakh from Dadlani through Sail. “The applicant saw that Kiran had saved mobile no. as SW2, thereby showing that he was connected with top NCB officials. However, the Truecaller pop up showed the name of Prabhakar Sail... After coming to know that Kiran Gosavi was a fraud, the applicant’s only motive was to recover the money and save his image... Therefore, he connected Sunil Patil and Kiran Gosavi and recovered the money and return it to Pooja Dadlani, through her husband,” the application stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-rejects-sam-d-souza-s-pre-arrest-bail-plea-101635959460930.html
04-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi CM Kejriwal, cabinet colleagues to participate in Diwali rituals||On the eve of Diwali on Wednesday, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal appealed to the citizens to strictly follow Covid discipline -- wear a mask and avoid crowded places -- while observing festivities, and reminded them that it was during this time last year that the number of Covid cases spiked. Kejriwal said that he has seen pictures of people flouting norms in crowded markets. He said that the Covid pandemic is still not over and dengue is on the rise, and stressed the need to practise utmost care and preventive behaviour.“Diwali is the time when happiness and zeal galore all over the country. Covid cases have been low and people are flocking the markets. But, several people are not following norms and not wearing masks,” Kejriwal said.“I have seen pictures from markets where norms are being flouted. I fold my hands before the people of Delhi and make an earnest request -- please wear masks, please follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. It was at this time last year, when Covid cases boomed and badly affected the festivities,” the chief minister said.Kejriwal appealed to the people to step out only when necessary to curb the spread of the viral disease. “Please don’t be irresponsible. I am not asking this for any personal gains. It is you who will fall sick, it is you whose families will be under threat. Covid is a very lethal disease and we need to treat it in that manner itself. Please only step out of your homes when necessary and please wear a mask when you do so,” he said.Asking people to stay indoors, Kejriwal urged people to join him and his cabinet of ministers on the live telecast of Diwali Puja from the Thyagaraj Stadium where the state government has built a temporary structure resembling the under-construction Ram Mandir in Ayodhya.“Tomorrow (Thursday), we will be celebrating Diwali. Let us celebrate it together once again. At 7 pm, I will be participating in the rituals with my cabinet ministers and the event will be broadcast live on several TV channels. I request you to join us from your homes,” said Kejriwal at an online briefing.Kejriwal visited Ayodhya last week, and his ministerial colleagues participated in Diwali rituals at the Akshardham Temple last year. The rituals were live-streamed to discourage people from stepping out for community celebrations in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and Sanjay Singh, the ruling Aam Aadmi Party’s Uttar Pradesh in-charge, in September held a “Tiranga yatra (Tricolour march)” in Ayodhya while calling for Ram Rajya that they equated with true nationalism and communal harmony.The two offered prayers at the Ram Janmabhoomi Temple and the Hanuman Garhi Temple besides meeting several seers in Ayodhya.The Bharatiya Janata Party, Samajwadi Party, and the Bahujan Samaj Party earlier also kick-started their campaigns ahead of the 2022 polls in Uttar Pradesh from Ayodhya. The Supreme Court in 2019 paved the way for the construction of the Ram temple at the disputed site where the demolished Babri Masjid once stood.Also Read: Will offer free pilgrimage if voted in, says Arvind KejriwalKejriwal also warned people over increasing cases of dengue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/kejriwal-cabinet-colleagues-to-participate-in-diwali-rituals-101635926937159.html
04-11-2021||Delhi||Kejriwal govt working on website for Delhi markets to showcase and sell products||The Delhi government is working on creating a virtual marketplace for registered traders, entrepreneurs and professionals to display their products and services, and reach a wider audience, said chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday.He further said that the platform, which will enable both business-to-consumer (B2C) and business-to-business (B2B) transactions, and also organise virtual exhibitions, is expected to be launched in August 2022. “On the occasion of Diwali, we have a great announcement for traders, entrepreneurs, professionals and industrialists in Delhi. We will soon launch a web portal named ‘Dilli Bazaar’, aimed at increasing economic activities which help the business sector, and also generate more revenue for the government,” said Kejriwal in a video press briefing.Elaborating on the project, he said it will work like a virtually mapped version of Delhi’s markets, through which people can browse through registered shops and the products and services they offer, without physically visiting them. “Imagine sitting at your homes and going through all products and varieties at shops located in real markets such as Lajpat Nagar and Khan Market. One can do that from anywhere in the world. Even a trader based in US or UK will be able to, say, order 200 pieces of a product from a shop in Hauz Khas, without visiting the shop and checking out its articles in person,” said Kejriwal. The chief minister said people will also be able to search for products on the portal without opting for the virtual market mode; in that case, it will work just like any e-retail website. The portal will also help in organising exhibitions, said Kejriwal.“It is a slightly complicated system and will need good amount of work. We have started the work and are planning to launch it in August 2022,” Kejriwal added.In a statement issued later in the day, the chief minister’s office said, “Delhi will have its own e-marketplace, in which every small and big entrepreneur can have their own e-commerce store. ’Dilli Bazaar’... will give a global online identity to every trader, businessperson, professional, service provider and shopkeeper of Delhi. Through the portal, shoppers will be able to go on virtual walkthroughs of Delhi’s markets, buy any product they like from their home itself.”“From Lajpat Nagar and Sarojini Nagar markets to local DDA markets -- every shop in Delhi will be able to sell its products online through the portal... Startups will benefit greatly from the exposure. Delhi’s GDP, tax revenues and economic activities will see a monumental rise after the launch of ‘Dilli Bazaar’ portal. Global business will come to Delhi. Someone sitting in America too will be able to buy from the smallest of the businesses of Delhi,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/kejriwal-govt-working-on-website-for-delhi-markets-to-showcase-and-sell-products-101635925256744.html

However, it is yet to become clear how many of these employees are unvaccinated.For another 17 million people working in nursing homes, hospitals and other facilities that receive money from Medicare and Medicaid, there is no option for testing, but mandatory vaccination.Workers will need to receive either two doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine or one dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine by January 4. Unvaccinated employees would have to submit a verified negative test to the company at least once a week and wear face masks on the job. Employees who test positive would have to be removed from the workplace.Agency reports said workers will be able to ask for exemptions on medical or religious grounds.Biden Admn announcing details of 2 policies to fight COVID.

The requirements for masks and paid time off for shots will take effect from December 5.As the vaccines are free, the companies do not have to provide or pay for tests.The administration will face an immediate challenge from Republican state officials who are eager to fight Biden in court. More than two dozen Republicans serving as state attorneys general have indicated they plan to sue, arguing that only Congress can enact such sweeping requirements under emergency authority.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-admin-mandates-compulsory-covid-jabs-or-tests-for-private-firm-workers-101636031911599.html

Last week, Europe and Central Asia accounted for almost half of the world’s reported deaths from Covid-19. The outbreak has accelerating in Europe over the last four weeks as colder temperatures lead to more socializing indoors, while many countries have eased restrictions. The WHO has repeatedly said that the pandemic is not yet over, and that governments should keep public-health measures such as mask-wearing along with vaccinations.“According to one reliable projection, if we stay on this trajectory, we could see another half a million Covid-19 deaths in Europe and Central Asia by Feb. 1 next year,” Hans Kluge, the World Health Organization’s regional director for Europe, said at a media briefing on Thursday.

04-11-2021||World||Germany reports record number of new Covid-19 cases||Germany's disease control agency on Thursday reported the highest number of new coronavirus infections since the outbreak of the pandemic.The Robert Koch Institute, or RKI, said 33,949 new cases had been registered in the last 24 hours, up from 28,037 daily cases a week ago. The previous record was 33,777 new cases on Dec. 18, 2020.The all-time high comes as the country's federal Health Minister Jens Spahn is set to meet with the 16 state health ministers to discuss how to limit the spread of the virus in the winter as intensive care units in the hospitals are starting to fill up again and infections among children are skyrocketing.On Thursday, the RKI reported 165 deaths, up from 126 a week ago. The overall number of people who have died from a COVID-19 infection in Germany has risen to to 96,192.Senior health officials have repeatedly appealed to German residents who haven't yet been vaccinated at all to get their shots, though Spahn acknowledged Wednesday that many of the holdouts can't be convinced.Official figures show that about two-thirds of Germany's population of 83 million has completed its first round of vaccination. Around 16.2 million people age 12 or above remain unvaccinated — including 3.2 million over-60s.Although officials agreed in August to make booster shots available to over-60s and nursing home residents and staff, only just over 2 million have been administered so far.Germany hasn't made coronavirus vaccinations obligatory for any professional groups, unlike some of its European counterparts. But regional governments have limited access to some indoor events and facilities to people who have been vaccinated, have recently recovered or been tested, and some are tightening those rules.Pressure has been growing to implement mandatory tests in nursing homes after several outbreaks were reported in senior citizen homes in recent days that have led to more than a dozen residents dying.The head of the association of family doctors, Ulrich Weigeldt, went even further on Thursday demanding mandatory coronavirus vaccinations for all employees working in nursing homes or hospitals.“No unvaccinated person should have contact with such a vulnerable group, either professionally or as a visitor," Weigeldt told daily tabloid Bild. "This applies to senior citizen homes and nursing homes as well as to intensive care units.” (AP) CPS||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-reports-record-number-of-new-covid-19-cases-101636017441915.html

The Environmental Working Group, in its report claimed that toxic contaminants have been discovered in the tap water, which is consumed by Americans on a daily basis.In the report, researchers discovered 56 new contaminants, including pesticides and radioactive materials, in tap water. The problem is mainly caused by the decaying infrastructure and the pollution from toxic "forever chemicals", that can be found in water, air, food or even in shampoo or makeup, according to the report.The researchers studied nearly 50,000 water systems over the past two years from across the US to arrive at conclusion.There are several thousand types of Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS), but their common characteristic is that they disintegrate extremely slowly, earning them the nickname "forever chemicals".Once ingested, these chemicals accumulate in the body. According to some studies, exposure to PFAS can lead to problems with fertility, developmental delays in children, increased risks of obesity or certain cancers (prostate, kidney and testicular). It can also increase cholesterol levels or even a decrease in the immune response to certain infections or after a vaccine.The PFAS can notably be found in things like food packaging, such as pizza boxes. It is also found in certain cleaning products, paints, varnishes or coatings. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of the US, due to the widespread use of products with PFAS, it makes it "challenging to study and assess the extent of potential human health and environmental risks." "Many PFAS are found in the blood of people and animals all over the world and are present at low levels in a variety of food products and in the environment," the EPA informed on its official website.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/toxic-forever-chemicals-contaminating-us-tap-water-claims-report-101636009169423.html

He said he thought it was possible that someone purposely placed real bullets, which look similar to dummies, in the box."We're afraid that could have been what happened here, that somebody intended to sabotage this set with a live round intentionally placed in a box of dummies," Bowles said on ABC television's "Good Morning America.""We're not saying anybody had any intent there was going to be a tragedy of homicide," he added, "but they wanted to do something to cause a safety incident on set. That's what we believe happened."A spokeswoman for producers Rust Movie Productions had no comment on Bowles' remarks. The company has said it is investigating the incident and had received no official complaints about safety on the set in Santa Fe, New Mexico.Authorities are investigating the matter and no charges have been filed against anyone involved."Never in a million years did Hannah think that live rounds could have been in the 'dummy' round box," Bowles said in a statement later on Wednesday.Cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was killed on Oct. 21 when a gun Baldwin was holding released a live bullet, police said. Baldwin had been told by assistant director Dave Halls that the gun was "cold", an industry term meaning it is safe to use.Bowles said Gutierrez had checked the gun before giving it to Halls. She spun the cylinder and showed Halls each of the rounds, which she believed were six dummy rounds, he said. Halls then took the gun into the church where Baldwin was rehearsing a scene.He said that Gutierrez took her job seriously, had given Baldwin and other actors on the film firearms training, and "did everything in her power to ensure a safe set."Before the shooting, camera operators had quit the film to protest against what they said were long hours and other objectionable working conditions, authorities in Santa Fe have said.Asked who would intentionally place live ammunition with dummy rounds, Bowles said on NBC's "Today" show that he believed it could be a person who wanted "to prove a point, to say that they're disgruntled, they're unhappy"."And we know that people had already walked off the set the day before," he said.Baldwin, who was also a producer on the film, has said he is heartbroken and is cooperating with authorities. On Tuesday, he shared a message on social media from a crew member who disputed reports of chaos and a lax attitude toward safety on the set.An attorney for Halls did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/somebody-intended-to-sabotage-lawyer-on-tragedy-on-baldwin-movie-set-101636007469478.html

Faiz Siddiqui had said in his plea before a court in the United Kingdom (UK) that his human rights were violated.But the Court of Appeal dismissed his petition, saying he is not entitled even to a penny, the Daily Mail report said. It also rejected the claims made by Siddiqui that his rights had been breached, it added.Oxford-educated Siddiqui, who also trained as a lawyer, practiced at top law firms and also worked at Ernst & Young as a tax advisor. He is a qualified solicitor but has been jobless since 2011. Siddiqui has been living rent free for 20 years in a £1 million home near Hyde Park in London, which is owned by his parents Rakshanda, 69, and Javed, 71.They have also been giving Siddiqui £400 every week for his expenses and paying his bills and other expenses. That support was reduced after a family dispute.He demanded the money be increased and the support from “enormously wealthy” parents to continue for life, reported Daily Mail.But the judge said in the order, "Parents should be under no legal duty to support their adult children, however grave their need," according to Daily Mail.The lawyers of Rakshanda and Javed, who live in Dubai, described Faiz as "difficult and demanding" and said that his parents were "long-suffering".This was first of its kind test case in the UK and Faiz Siddiqui was backed by a human rights lawyer.He had earlier sued Oxford University for £1,000,000 in 2018 over his failure to get first-class honours, claiming what he was taught was inadequate. He lost that case too.The judge hearing his case had said that Siddiqui's "inadequate preparation" and "lack of academic discipline" were the reasons he under performed in his exams.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jobless-man-41-who-sued-parents-seeking-maintenance-for-life-loses-appeal-101636006454206.html
04-11-2021||World||China rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal; intends to 'produce over 1,000 warheads by 2030': Pentagon||The People's Republic China (PRC) is rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal and "intends to produce over 1,000 warheads by 2030", a new report by the Pentagon has revealed. In a report titled "Military and Security Developments Involving the People's Republic of China (PRC) 2021", the headquarters of the United States Department of Defense said that the accelerating pace of the PRC's nuclear expansion may enable the country "to have up to 700 deliverable nuclear warheads by 2027"."The PRC likely intends to have at least 1,000 warheads by 2030," the report also stated, adding that it will significantly outpace Pentagon estimates from last year. In 2020, the US Defense Department had projected that China would have 400 nuclear warheads by 2030.The report also said that China is heavily investing in and expanding the number of its land, sea and air-base nuclear delivery platforms and constructing the infrastructure necessary to support the expansion."The PRC has possibly already established a nascent 'nuclear triad' with the development of a nuclear capable air-launched ballistic missile (ALBM) and improvement of its ground and sea-based nuclear capabilities," Pentagon stated in the report.It also informed that the country is supporting its nuclear expansion by "increasing its capacity to produce and separate plutonium by constructing fast breeder reactors and reprocessing facilities.""New developments in 2020 further suggest that the PRC intends to increase the peacetime readiness of its nuclear forces by moving to a launch-on-warning (LOW) posture with an expanded silo-based force," the Pentagon also stated in the report that was released on Wednesday.This comes in the backdrop of rising tension between the United States and China over Taiwan, where it had flown a record number of military flights, sparking concerns of a potential conflict. According to reports, China sent over 200 aircraft to Taiwan for exercises in the month of October, to exert pressure on the self-ruled island.The United States, which backed the democratic government in Taiwan, has been trading warnings with China over the same. China claims the island as part of its own territory and views any foreign intervention over Taiwan as interference in its domestic affairs.Meanwhile, the report also mentioned that China is seeking to establish a more robust overseas logistics and basing infrastructure to allow China's People's Liberation Army "to project and sustain military power at greater distances". "Beyond its base in Djibouti, the PRC is pursuing additional military facilities to support naval, air, ground, cyber, and space power projection," the Pentagon said in the report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-rapidly-expanding-its-nuclear-arsenal-intends-to-produce-over-1-000-warheads-by-2030-pentagon-101635998650705.html
04-11-2021||World||Pentagon issues detailed report on China. From nuclear woes to defence plans, here are key points||The Pentagon, the headquarters of the United States Department of Defense, released on Wednesday its comprehensive report on China, in which it detailed a host of things – including the missions and tasks with which Beijing is equipping armed forces in the “new era” and all-inclusive data on China's defense contracts, its resources and technology for modernisation, and the Dragon's growing global influence under president Xi Jinping. It also contains a host of elaborate data on the Taiwan crisis, the India-China border standoff, as well as the underlying pattern in the multilateral exercises conducted by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) last year.China sought to prevent India from deepening ties with USThe Pentagon said in its report that despite ongoing diplomatic and military dialogues to reduce border tensions, China has continued “taking incremental and tactical actions” to press its claims at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with India and has unsuccessfully sought to prevent New Delhi from deepening its relationship with the United States.The Pentagon regularly reports to the Congress on the Indo-Chinese military standoff in eastern Ladakh. The Department of Defense has categorically said China is indulging in aggressive and coercive behaviour with its neighbours, India in particular. In addition, a substantial reserve force from the Tibet and Xinjiang Military Districts were deployed to the interior of Western China to provide a rapid response to the border situation, the report said.Border standoff: China reluctant to back off from LACThe Pentagon confirmed that in 2020, China built a large 100-home civilian village in a piece of “disputed territory” between the Chinese Tibet Autonomous Region and India's Arunachal Pradesh state in the eastern sector of the LAC.At the height of the border standoff between China and India in 2020, the Chinese Army even installed a fiber-optic network in the remote areas of the western Himalayas to provide faster communications and increased protection from foreign interception, the report said. It added that the PLA field commanders view near-real-time intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, and situational data as well as redundant and reliable communications as essential to streamlining decision-making processes and shortening response timelines.Meanwhile, China’s state-controlled media continues to forcefully assert Beijing's intent to refuse any territorial concessions demanded by India. It has continued to blame India for provoking the standoff through India's increased infrastructure development near the LAC and using this as justification, China refused to withdraw forces till India's forces have withdrawn behind the Chinese version of the LAC and ceased infrastructure improvements in the area.China boosting its nuclear arsenal much faster than expectedChina is expanding its nuclear arsenal much more quickly than anticipated, narrowing the gap with the United States, the Pentagon said in its latest report, pointing out that Beijing could have as many as 700 deliverable nuclear warheads by 2027, and could top 1,000 by 2030 – an arsenal two-and-a-half times the size of what the Pentagon predicted only a year ago.The report said that China is actively investing in, and expanding its land, sea, and air-based means to deploy nuclear weapons, building the infrastructure necessary to support this major expansion of its nuclear forces, not unlike the other two leading nuclear powers – the United States and Russia.The Pentagon, however, said that it is unlikely that China is seeking a capability to launch an unprovoked nuclear strike on a nuclear-armed adversary – primarily the United States – but this current expansion is aimed at deterring attacks from others by maintaining a credible threat of nuclear retaliation.Potential customers of Chinese weapons consider PRC arms to be of lower qualityPotential customers consider arms made by China to be of lower quality and reliability, however, some countries still buy them as they are less expensive, the Pentagon said in its recent report.Arms transfers are a key component in China's foreign policy, used in conjunction with other types of assistance to complement initiatives undertaken as part of China's ‘One Belt, One Road’ strategy.Beijing sells major systems such as UAVs, submarines, and fighter aircraft to customers like Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Pakistan. The PRC has supplied its strike-capable Caihong or Wing Loongfamilies of armed Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to at least Pakistan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE, Algeria, Serbia, and Kazakhstan.Beijing also supplies naval vessels, highlighted by Pakistan's purchase of eight Yuan-class submarines for more than $3 billion, according to the report.China conducts ‘influence operations’ to target media and cultural institutions in other countriesChina conducts influence operations, which target cultural institutions, media organisations, business, academic, and policy communities in the US, other countries, and international institutions, to achieve outcomes favourable to its strategic objectives, the Pentagon said.The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) seeks to condition domestic, foreign, and multilateral political establishments and public opinion to accept Beijing's narratives and remove obstacles preventing the attainment of goals. CCP leaders probably consider open democracies, including the US, as more susceptible to influence operations than other types of governments.The PLA has emphasised the development of its “Three Warfares” concept – comprised of psychological warfare, public opinion warfare, and legal warfare – in its operational planning since at least 2003, the US Defence Department said. The PLA will also likely continue to develop its digital influence capabilities by incorporating advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) to improve the quality and deniability of its messaging. (With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pentagon-issues-detailed-report-on-china-from-nuclear-woes-to-defence-plans-here-are-key-points-101635992976765.html

There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but the attack bore the hallmarks of previous IS strikes against the Taliban.The two groups are bitter rivals, and IS has stepped up attacks since the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in August.Wednesday’s bomb went off in the city of Jalalabad, the capital of Nangarhar province.A Taliban district commander in the city confirmed the blast and said four Taliban fighters were wounded. The commander, who identified himself as Mubariz did not provide details about those killed in the attack, saying the investigation continues.The Jalalabad attack came a day after IS attackers set off an explosion at the gate of a 400-bed military hospital in the capital of Kabul, killing three women, a child and three Taliban guards. Five assailants were also killed in the attack. Initial reports said 25 were killed in the attack.Taliban ban US dollarsThe Taliban government has banned the use of foreign currencies in Afghanistan in a surprise move that could weigh on an economy struggling with a cash crunch and further isolate the country.The militant group’s spokesman Zabihullah Mujahed said the Afghans should use the local currency in view of the economic situation. Much of Afghanistan’s local trade is done in US dollars.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bomb-targets-taliban-kills-two-in-is-k-hub-101635988286982.html

It is a major step forward for our nation in our fight to defeat the virus.”The CDC said the vaccination of children could begin “as soon as possible”.Distribution of the paediatric vaccine has already begun and plans afoot to scale up to full capacity starting on November 8, CDC said, adding that vaccines will be available at multiple locations, including paediatric health care provider offices, pharmacies and Federally Qualified Health Centers (HRSA).Meanwhile, daily cases and deaths in Russia remained at their highest numbers of the pandemic on Wednesday as more regions announced extending existing restrictions in an effort to tame the surge.Russia’s state coronavirus task force reported 40,443 new confirmed cases from a day earlier. It was the fifth time in seven days that the country reported more than 40,000 infections. The task force also reported a daily record of 1,189 Covid-19 deaths.More provinces in China are fighting Covid-19 than at any time since the deadly pathogen first emerged in Wuhan in 2019.

04-11-2021||World||‘Need actions, not words’: China hits back after US pans Xi's COP26 no-show||China hit back Wednesday against criticism by US President Joe Biden, who had accused Beijing of not showing leadership after President Xi Jinping skipped the make-or-break COP26 United Nations summit in Glasgow.Xi -- who leads the planet's largest emitter of the greenhouse gases responsible for climate change -- has not travelled outside of China since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic and has not joined world leaders for COP26.Biden on Tuesday had launched blistering criticism of the Chinese and Russian leaders for not attending the summit."Actions speak louder than words," Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin responded Wednesday."What we need in order to deal with climate change is concrete action rather than empty words," he added. "China's actions in response to climate change are real."He also made a jibe at Washington by adding that the United States pulling out of the Paris Agreement under Biden's predecessor Donald Trump had harmed global climate governance and the implementation of the accord.Biden has apologised for Trump's decision.COP26 has been billed as vital for the continued viability of the 2015 Paris Agreement under which nations promised to limit global temperature rises to "well below" 2C and to work for a safer 1.5C cap.At the summit on Tuesday, nearly one hundred nations joined the US and European Union initiative to cut emissions of methane -- a potent greenhouse gas -- by at least 30 percent this decade, with China among notable absentees.Experts say the initiative could have a powerful short-term impact on global heating."It just is a gigantic issue and they walked away. How do you do that and claim to be able to have any leadership?" Biden told journalists before flying out of Glasgow. “It's been a big mistake, quite frankly, for China not showing up. The rest of the world looked at China and said: ‘What value are they providing?’”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/need-actions-not-words-china-hits-back-after-us-pans-xi-s-cop26-noshow-101635985762016.html
04-11-2021||India||CCTV footage confirms SRK's manager visited Lower Parel after Aryan was detained: Reports||A CCTV footage of Shah Rukh Khan's manager Pooja Dadlani at Lower Parel has been found by the special investigation team probing the allegation of extortion in connection with the cruise drugs case, reports said. KP Gosavi's former aide Prabhakar Sail claimed that Gosavi and Sam D'Souza met SRK's manager Pooja in that area and there was allegedly a deal of ₹18 crore. Sam D'Souza, meanwhile, claimed he was not part of the deal, but ₹50 lakh was taken from Pooja Dadlani which was returned to her after Aryan Khan was arrested.Reports also claimed that police may register a case against Gosavi, who is in the custody of Pune Police till November 5 in an old fraud case.The drugs case in which Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan Khan was arrested took a surprising turn with Prabhakar Sail, a witness in the case, alleged that Sameer Wankhede made him sign blank papers. In his complaint, he mentioned that he overheard a conversation between KP Gosavi and Prabhakar Sail where he heard the amount ₹18 crore which was supposed to be demanded from Shah Rukh Khan in exchange for the release of his son. Sail also claimed that he heard Gosavi as saying that Narcotics Control Bureau Mumbai zone chief Sameer Wankhede would be a party to receive a portion of that amount.While these allegations are being investigated, a new claim has been made by Sam D'Souza who said Pooja Dadlani paid ₹50 lakh to Gosavi as Gosavi told SRK's manager that he could help Aryan release as no drugs were found on him. This took place between October 2 and October 3, when Aryan Khan was detained in the NCB raid of the cruise but was not arrested. On October 3, Aryan was arrested. After spending 22 days in Mumbai's Arthur Rod jail, he was finally released from the jail on bail on October 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cctv-footage-confirms-srk-s-manager-visited-lower-parel-after-aryan-was-detained-reports-101636045467086.html

Vaishnavi in her letter said that she and her siblings, Preethi and Praneeth, were facing issues commuting to school because of the sudden halt of services in the aftermath of Covid-19 pandemic, legal news website LiveLaw said in a report.Vaishnavi also highlighted that it was not possible for her to afford an auto-rickshaw to go to school. She said that her father passed away due to Covid-19 during the first wave and her mother runs the family on a meagre income.The Chief Justice of India upon receiving the letter took prompt action and alerted the Telangana State Road Transport Corporation (TSRTC) regarding the issue. The CJI told them that the services need to resume so as to honour the child’s right to education.Soon after the CJI’s intervention, VC Sajjanar, the managing director of the TSRTC, informed via Twitter that the bus service was restored. “Spoke to P Vaishnavi also with her mother, greeted Diwali wishes and appreciated the baby (the student) for writing about the issue to CJI Ramana sir,” he said in a tweet.He also shared a video where Vaishnavi’s mother was seen speaking on the phone to Sajjanar. “TSRTC management sincerely thanks the Hon'ble apex court Chief Justice of India CJI Ramana sir for alerting us to restore buses to send students on school timings in token of honoring RTE,” he said in another tweet.This was not the first time that the CJI responded to children’s queries and requests. Earlier in June he responded to a girl from Kerala who drew a picture of a judge at work and thanked the courts for helping in taking measures which helped the country during fighting the second wave of Covid-19. CJI Ramana wrote back to her saying that he was ‘impressed’ with her keeping track of ‘happenings in the country and the concern that she displayed for the well being of people in the wake of pandemic’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/girl-writes-to-cji-seeking-restoration-of-bus-services-he-gets-it-done-101636040825155.html
04-11-2021||India||‘Will ask Mamata to reduce tax if…’: TMC leader counters BJP on petrol prices||KOLKATA: After several Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled states followed the Centre’s cue and reduced local taxes on petrol and diesel, the party’s West Bengal unit on Thursday mounted pressure on chief minister Mamata Banerjee, demanding a similar step.“The BJP will hit the streets of Bengal after Bhai Dooj, demanding a cut in state taxes on petrol and diesel. Several states have done it. Why can’t Mamata Banerjee follow their example?” Bengal BJP’s chief spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya said on Thursday.Bhai Dooj, a ritual performed by Hindu women, will be observed on November 6.Of the total taxes charged on prices of petrol and diesel in Bengal, the state’s share accounts for around 37%. In February, ahead of state elections, Mamata Banerjee reduced the state tax by Re 1 per litre but there has been no further revision since then. The TMC, as well as opposition parties such as the Congress, have held demonstrations against the Centre on the price issue in recent months.The retail price of petrol came down by ₹5.7 to ₹6.35 per litre across the country on Thursday on account of the ₹5 reduction in Central Excise Duty while diesel prices came down by ₹11.16 to ₹12.88 due to the ₹10 reduction. Apart from base price and taxes charges by states and the Centre, the retail price of petrol and diesel also includes freight charge and dealers’ commission.The ₹5 and ₹10 reduction of Central Excise Duty was the highest ever in excise duty and rolls back a part of the ₹13 and ₹16 per litre increase in taxes on petrol and diesel effected between March 2020 and May 2020 to avoid passing on to consumers the sharp fall in international oil prices.After the Centre’s announcement, Gujarat, Assam, Tripura, Manipur, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Goa have either notified or announced a reduction in state taxes on both petrol and diesel in addition to the relief offered by the Centre.Bengal BJP’s Bhattacharya said the Centre never claimed that the prices would return to what they used to be five years ago.“The government only took a positive step to help people. Instead of appreciating that, the Trinamool Congress resorted to political attack, calling the action an eyewash,” said Bhattacharya.The TMC leadership, however, did not change its stance.“The tax reduction by the Centre is similar to what we often see in local markets during festivals. Traders hike prices by 40% and then offer shoppers a discount of 10 % to fool them,” TMC Rajya Sabha member Sukhendu Sekhar Roy told HT.Roy also brushed aside the reduced taxes on fuel announced by BJP-ruled states, saying this was only done in view of the coming assembly elections.Five states - Goa, Manipur, Punjab, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh - are scheduled to go to the polls in early 2022. Except for Congress-ruled Punjab, the other four states have a BJP leader as chief minister.“The BJP-ruled states have cut taxes in view of the coming assembly polls. Let the elections take place. If the BJP returns to power in these states and continues to charge less on petrol and diesel, TMC leaders will request Mamata Banerjee to cut the state taxes in Bengal,” Roy added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-ask-mamata-to-reduce-tax-if-tmc-leader-counters-bjp-on-petrol-prices-101636038787190.html

Sameer Wankhede said Nawab Malik should go to the Lokhandwala area to check the price of the clothes. His sister Yasmeen Wankhede said those watches that Nawab Malik mentioned were a gift from their mother. "My mummy has gifted him all these watches and to me also... these were purchased around 17 years back. My brother saves money the whole year to do shopping one day...he wears these clothes for entire year. He makes a list of what he wants and then goes for shopping," Yasmeen said, as quoted by PTI.Yasmeen also said that instead of raising questions over Sameer Wankhede's lifestyle, one should ask how Nawab Malik's son-in-law travels in a Jaguar, how he gets such kind of money.Sameer Wankhede's wife, Marathi actor Kranti Redkar Wankhede said Sameer's entire property belongs to her mother and it is definitely not worth ₹50 to 100 crore, she said. "Sameer owns them since 15 years of age onwards. All documents are produced to the government every year as per rules for civil servants. They are not BENAMI," Kranti tweeted.The NCB official's wife on Tuesday also posted the photo of their lunch and provided the details and wrote, "..just in case someone puts allegations tomorrow morning that we ate some food that a government official's family must not have."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-sameer-wankhede-s-clothes-assets-lifestyle-are-under-scrutiny-101636037035966.html

Political leaders have criticised the development.The duration of the Srinagar-Sharjah flight has gone up by 45 minutes, increasing from three hours and 30 minutes to four hours and 15 minutes, according to a GoFirst official. The airline has also not ruled out an increase in the fare if the longer route remains in place.Srinagar international airport director Kuldeep Singh said the flight received a good response, and the airline has had full occupancy.Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah was among the politicians who were critical of Pakistan’s decision.“Very unfortunate. Pakistan did the same thing with the Air India Express flight from Srinagar to Dubai in 2009-2010. I had hoped that @GoFirstairways being permitted to overfly Pak airspace was indicative of a thaw in relations, but alas that wasn’t to be,” he tweeted.The first international flight from Srinagar airport to Dubai was launched in 2009. However, all international flights stopped after some time because of a variety of reasons, including Pakistan’s refusal to allow the use of its airspace.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-asks-pak-to-restore-overflight-clearance-for-srinagar-sharjah-flights-101636035008009.html

The effort comes at a time trade volumes have surged.India exported $46.2 billion worth of goods to the US in the eight months from January to August this year, according to US government statistics, compared to $51.2 billion for all of 2020 and $57.8 billion for 2019.The US Trade Representative’s office said Tai and Goyal at their virtual meeting “agreed to take a comprehensive look at ways to expand the bilateral trade relationship and ensure the future success of the US-India Trade Policy Forum (TPF)’.Established in 2005, TPF is the highest-level platform for the two countries to discuss trade issues. It has met infrequently in the past despite a growing slate of disputes and disagreements it was intended to address.There were no indications if the two sides will pick up the trade talks from where the Trump administration left off, which is essentially a full plate of differences and higher tariff announced by the two sides in a mini-trade war sparked by then President Donald Trump’s unilateral levies on aluminium and steel to offset trade imbalances, and his decision to end preferential treatment of Indian exports under the Generalised System of Preferences.India and the Trump administration tried to resolve these and many old and new differences stemming from American demand for more access to Indian markets and removal of Indian measures that are seen as trade barriers. But a deal, no matter how modest, remained out of reach till the end.Commerce minister Piyush Goyal publicly blamed the Trump administration for this failure, alleging it kept changing the goalpost by constantly introducing new issues.People familiar with the talks and the upcoming meeting said the two sides could take a shot at “early harvest” agreements that are easily manageable and achievable. They are essentially issues that the two sides have already resolved or are close to it, and leave the rest for a later date. Tai and Goyal have talked and met virtually a few times since they first spoke in March after Tai formally took over on being confirmed by the US Senate.But trade talks have been at a near standstill, as borne out by the official readout of their meetings/interactions. The two officials agreed to “work constructively to resolve key outstanding bilateral trade issues and to take a comprehensive look at ways to expand the trade relationship”, the USTR said at the time.The language was about the same on Wednesday.People in the know cautioned against hopes of an ambitious deal and pointed to the Biden administration’s handling of trade relations with America’s largest trade partner and rival China as proof. It wants Beijing to fulfill its commitments made under the deal and has dropped plans of a larger deal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-us-trade-official-katherine-tai-to-visit-india-on-nov-2223-101636031106612.html

The Twitter handle of BJP Karnataka said the NDA state governments immediately decided on reducing the VAT, benefitting crores of people, but the opposition-ruled states are yet to announce the same. The swipe came as Karnataka claimed to be the first state to reduce salex tax on petrol and diesel, which will bring down by ₹19.47.Petrol, diesel cheaper on Diwali as multiple states cut VAT on fuel. Full listOpposition Parties were lecturing about price rise of petrol & diesel.Yesterday, PM @narendramodi Govt reduced excise duty on Petrol & Diesel.NDA State Govts immediately reduced the VAT on them benefiting crores of people.Opposition ruled States are yet to reduce the same.The government release said diesel prices were reduced from ₹104.50 on November 3 to ₹85.03, which is a reduction of ₹19.47. Petrol prices were reduced from ₹113.93 on November 3 to ₹100.63, which is a reduction of ₹13.30.Karnataka’s share of Sales Tax on Petrol is reduced from 35 to 25.9 percent and that on diesel has been reduced from 24 to 14.34 per cent, by virtue of today’s notification, it added."Opposition parties were lecturing about price rise of petrol and diesel.

Congress leader P Chidambaram on Thursday said the decision was a "by-product of by-elections". To this, former petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan said, "If the accusation is being sensitive to people’s demand and sharing their sorrow, we happily accept it as the #ModiGovt stands for being with the people in their happiness as well as in grief." Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi said the decision was out of fear and not from the heart.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-cuts-sales-tax-on-petrol-diesel-bjp-s-jibe-at-lecturing-opposition-101636030587629.html
04-11-2021||India||HT This Day: Nov 5, 1988 - Indian troops crush Male coup||New Delhi- In a swift operation crack Indian para troopers today (November 4) successfully crushed the coup bid by foreign mercenaries in Maldives and helped President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom to secure full control of the strategic island republic in the Indian Ocean.  As a result of the operation that ended around 2.30 a.m. today the paratroopers who were air-lifted from Indian bases chased away 400 mercenaries said to have been recruited by disgruntled ex-patriate Maldivian citizens. The coup bid thus collapsed in less than 24 hours after the mercenaries had stormed Presidential Palace and national security headquarters in Male, the capital, early yesterday morning.  The Indian forces intercepted one of the two boats from which the mercenaries had launched the attack on Male yesterday and were in hot pursuit of another boat believed to be carrying mercenaries and some hostages including Transport Minister Ahmed Mujuthaba. The second boat spotted on high seas by an Indian naval aircraft and would be intercepted very soon, a foreign office spokesman said here this evening.  The 5000 tonne-capacity boat, spotted on the high seas, is believed to be carrying some rebels, mercenaries and hostages, the spokesman said.  Male airport is safe and there is no report of fighting at present. There is no casualty on the Indian side, he said. Asked about the total strength of Indian troops sent to Male, the spokesman said the first bath sent last night numbered 300. Some more were sent this morning but the exact number was not known," he said.  Involved in the four hour operation were the Army, Navy and the Air Force. First hand reports said that the national security service headquarters and buildings around it which had witnessed heavy fighting yesterday bore marks of extensive damage. The Indian troops are in control of strategic buildings and points in the city.  Additional Indian troops were rushed to Male after the paratroopers successfully completed their mission. They cordoned off Male and began a house-to-house search to apprehend any possible mercenary in hiding.  The spokesman said the Government of India had the first call for military assistance yesterday morning from a close aide of President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who had left his palace for security. This morning the Maldivian President had personally talked to Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi on telephone.  Reports coming in from diverse sources indicate that the 2,320 tonne frigate, INS Betwa, was the first to reach the anchorage off Male today followed by the newly commissioned training ship INS tir (2,000 tonnes) which carries a helicopter on deck.  Both these ships were cruising close to the Lakshadweep and Minicoy group of islands and were ordered to set course for this mission. The third ship expected to be in the Maldive waters by tomorrow is the frigate INS Godavari (3,600 tonnes), which was off the east coast of Sri Lanka on way back from the Australian fleet review in Sydney harbour.  This afternoon, the other freight ship used by the Maldivian expatriates and mercenaries in the coup attempts, was brought under rocket fire by the Indian forces and sunk. But the men on board have managed to escape with the Maldivian Transport Minister as hostage. While full details of the deployment of the Indian security forces to Maldives are yet to be officially announced, it is learnt that close to a thousand troops, airlifted and para-dropped in a swift inter-service operation, carried out the task of restoring the capital city of Male to the constitutional authority in less than four hours.  The sources denied reports that INS Viraat, the aircraft carrier, had been committed in this operation. Such a large deployment was not required, they said.  Among the first to reach Male and overfly it with full sound and fury were the reconnaissance aircraft of the Indi- an Air Force. The naval surveillance aircraft also carried out sorties in support. Well informed sources monitoring the operations said some of the mercenaries fleeing Maldives in a boat may have died as a result of the boat being rocketed and sunk by the Indian forces. Details of the casualties were being awaited.  Besides the Navy, six Coast Guard speed boats are understood to have been dispatched to Male from Cochin.  The troops were flown in with the help of IL-76 Gajaraj and AN-32 Satluj from Bangalore and Trivandrum.  In a radio broadcast, Mr Gayoom thanked Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi for saving his nation from bloodshed. According to reports from Male, people who had kept indoors throughout yesterday came out to the streets at Daybreak today. President Gayoom went on the radio, urging calm and thanking god for delivering his nation of islands from violence. Ali, the Sri Lankan High Commissioner, said he had seen people walking and travelling by bicycles and motorcycles but few cars were on the road. Today is the weekly holiday when most businesses and shops close. Mosques were open for prayers as, life started to return to normal. Radio Male resumed broadcasting at 7.00 a.m. for the first time since it went off the air.  Mr Gayoom noted that he had survived three coup attempts since he was elected to office in 1978, but he gave no indication who was behind the latest attempt to remove him.  However, diplomatic sources and a Sri Lankan military official in Colombo blamed the attack on Sri Lankan Tamil guerillas and said they were recruited by an agent of former President Ibrahim Nasir.  DPA quoted the Maldivian High Commissioner Ahmed Abdulla in Colombo as saying that the Government of Mr Gayoom was in "total control" of the situation and the intruders had been repulsed. Mr Abdulla said some of the mercenaries were arrested while others escaped either by boat or to some of the hundreds of islands that make up the Archipelago. Other sources said the intruders fled in two ships shortly before the Indians landed. Mr Abdulla admitted casualties in several hours of fighting. He did not give further details.  Radio Male said 700 Indian paratroopers were on Male after landing last night on Hulule Island, a 10minute boat ride away. An Indian Navy ship was standing by off shore, the radio added.  Electricity flickered back today for the first time since the coup attempt started.  Sources in Male and Colombo, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the attackers inflicted heavy grenade and bullet damage on the Presidential Palace and other Government buildings, including the security force headquarters. But these sources said that human casualties appeared to be light.  "Indian troops have been seen guarding all main government buildings," Mohammad Sharif, a male resident said "everything is quiet now, our Government is under control." Mr Sharif said he had not heard any gunfire since about midnight Thursday.  Tourism and diplomatic sources in Colombo, about 800 km northeast of Male, said they were unaware of any tourists endangered by the attempted coup. A Colombo travel agent said he had been told there would be no commercial flights into the Maldives until at least Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-this-day-nov-5-1988-indian-troops-crush-male-coup-101636026949838.html
04-11-2021||India||Endangered lesser florican rescued in Maharashtra’s Solapur||A female lesser florican - an endangered species of bustard endemic to India of which less than 270 are estimated to be alive in the wild - was rescued by the forest department in Solapur, Maharashtra earlier this week. The bird was tagged with a metal ring bearing a unique ID number and released at Solapur’s Great Indian Bustard Bird Sanctuary, where, officials said, it will have a higher chance of survival.The sighting of the bird was reported on Tuesday by Hiremath, a resident of Nannaj in Solapur North, who noticed it taking shelter near his home seemingly to escape stray dogs. Hiremath informed the nearby sanctuary and the forest department’s office in Nannaj. Also Read: Doctor clicks rare Mottled Wood Owl in PrayagrajA team from Solapur’s forest department and the NGO Wildlife Conservation Association (WCA) moved the female bird to the district veterinary hospital as it had a minor injury on a wing.After examining the bird and administering first aid, the district veterinarian’s office issued a certificate stating that it was fit to be released back into the wild. It was released at the bird sanctuary the same afternoon in the presence of deputy forest conservator Dhairyashil Patil, range officer Shubhangi Jawale and WCA members. A female bird of the same species was last seen in Maharashtra in August this year, when it was photographed at the Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve.The bird is locally known as “tanmor” or “kharmor”, a forest department official said. “Four years ago, a lesser florican was also seen near the district police headquarters in Solapur. They are an endangered species. This sighting is important because it tells us they are still present in the area,” said the official, who requested not to be named.The lesser florican is one of three bustard species endemic to the country, the others being the Bengal florican and the Great Indian Bustard. A report by the Wildlife Institute of India in 2018 had estimated their population in the wild to be not more than 264, indicating a decline of about 80% over the last two decades.The species is classified as “endangered” by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and it also features in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), which “includes species not necessarily threatened with extinction, but in which trade must be controlled in order to avoid utilisation incompatible with their survival.” It is also protected under Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife Act.Kedar Gore, a wildlife biologist and director of the Corbett Foundation and member of three separate IUCN commissions, said the main reason behind the rapid decline in lesser florican numbers is the disappearance of grasslands and associated ecosystems. “Forests in India are better protected, but grasslands are not seen as having any ecological value. After hunting first drove down the numbers of these birds, their habitat has been under threat in Maharashtra mainly due to expansion of industries in grassland areas,” Gore said. “In Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, renewable energy projects have been established on grasslands where these birds mate. The Corbett Foundation, Bombay Natural History Society, state governments and various experts have been actively working on conservation measures, but there needs to be a wide-ranging policy to arrest the sort of land-use change that is destroying lesser floricans’ habitat,” Gore said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/endangered-lesser-florican-rescued-in-maharashtra-s-solapur-101636025586465.html

It is likely to increase to 20 per cent on Thursday and further to 35 to 40 per cent on Friday and Saturday with the wind direction changing to northwest, it said.Northwesterly winds carry smoke from farm fires in Punjab and Haryana towards the national capital.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-air-quality-remains-very-poor-amid-concerns-over-a-worsening-crisis-101636017369825.html
04-11-2021||India||Won LS seat without using Modi’s name: Shiv Sena on Dadra and Nagar Haveli win||Shiv Sena on Thursday said it won the by poll for Dadra and Nagar Haveli Lok Sabha seat without using Prime Minister Narendra Modi ‘s name or image and it showed that the party’s first ever victory on a Lok Sabha seat outside Maharashtra was a verdict against ‘dictatorial’ attitude. Sena candidate Kalaben Delkar won the Lok Sabha seat with over 51,000 votes in the October 30 by polls.“Just ahead of Diwali, the lantern of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is out of light; these are not good signs. The results of the by polls have put a crack in their arrogance that they are invincible and unbeatable,” an editorial in Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana said. “Without using the name of Modi or using his picture on posters, Shiv Sena won in Gujarat’s bordering [Union] territory. Despite chanting ‘Modi-Modi’ in Deglur, BJP had to taste defeat,” the Saamana editorial said, referring to the fact that Deglur assembly seat by polls in Nanded district was won by the Congress.Calling it a “historic” win, Sena mouthpiece said the party’s journey so far has been from Dadar to Dadra, and will now head toward Delhi. “The Sena’s journey has been from Mumbai’s Dadar to Dadra [and Nagar Haveli], it will definitely knock on the doors of Delhi soon… The victory in Dadar Nagar Haveli is not just a win but it is a setback to the dictatorial attitude in the country,” the Sena said.Also Read | Covid-19 pandemic: 19 districts in Maharashtra have less than 50 active casesThe mouthpiece added that Shiv Sena ally, the Congress, had taken a lead in the by polls held in 13 states for a total of three Lok Sabha and 29 assembly seats.

They have played an immeasurable role in protecting our country," the Prime Minister said while addressing soldiers at Nowshera in Jammu and Kashmir."The role of women in the area of security of the nation is touching new heights.

The doors of premier military institutions have also been opened for them now," he added.The government had earlier given the nod for admitting girl cadets to Sainik Schools across the country.Speaking on the occasion the PM reiterated his vision of 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' and said that the commitment to self-reliance in the defence sector is the only way to change old methods of procuring defence equipment."Today's India is Aatmanirbhar and Sashakt! We are changing the narrative of importing defence equipment. Today, 65 per cent of our defence budget goes into buying defence equipment that is Made in India," the Prime Minister said."With the changing times, we have to change our defence preparedness. We are increasing our connectivity pool and laying down optical fibres across the borders," he added.The Prime Minister today continued his annual tradition of celebrating Diwali with soldiers. He left from Delhi for Nowshera today with minimum security arrangements.In his address at Nowshera, the Prime Minister said, "I am not here as a PM but as your family member to celebrate Diwali."Earlier in the day, the Prime Minister paid tribute to soldiers who lost their lives in the line of duty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-diwali-pm-modi-lauds-role-of-women-in-providing-security-to-the-nation-101636013701619.html
04-11-2021||India||China prepared for spike in border tensions with India: US defence dept report||The Chinese army’s acceleration of its training and fielding of heavy military equipment has prepared it for any escalation of border tensions with India and to support a “Taiwan contingency”, according to a new US defence department report.The annual report prepared for the US Congress on military and security developments related to China has a special section on the India-China standoff on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) that began in May 2020 and has taken bilateral relations to an all-time low.The report said that despite the Covid-19 pandemic, border clashes with India and other significant events in 2020, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) “accelerated its training and fielding of equipment from the already fast pace of recent years”.Also Read: Nuclear woes, defence plans: Key points from Pentagon’s detailed report on ChinaThis equipment fielding during 2020 “focused on improving mobile firepower and mobility with the PCL-171 120mm self-propelled howitzer and the PCL-181 155mm self-propelled howitzer, as well as field testing of the Z-8L heavy-lift transport helicopter”. PLA units also conducted “extensive combined arms and joint training throughout 2020”.The report said, “Significant training likely prepared the [PLA] for any escalation of border tensions with India, as well as preparing to support a Taiwan contingency.”The “Taiwan contingency” was a reference to China’s long-standing plan to unify the island with the mainland.The PLA, which has about 975,000 active duty personnel in combat units, strove to increase the realism of its training”, and its units conducted “robust combined-arms training and extensive joint training exercises” with other services.“In 2020, the [PLA] highlighted training for... potential contingencies in high-elevation regions (suggesting a possible focus on India given border clashes in 2020) and projecting forces across the Taiwan Strait,” the report said.There was also a significant PLA “force build-up and establishment or enforcement of forward positions” along the LAC during 2020, and these “tensions likely provided the [PLA] with valuable real-world operational and tactical experience”, the report said.Also Read: ‘Blaming Nehru would not solve China problem’: Nirupama RaoAt the height of the LAC standoff in 2020, the PLA installed a fibre optic network in remote areas of the western Himalayas to provide faster communications and increased protection from foreign interception. The PLA field commanders now “view near real-time ISR and situational data as well as redundant and reliable communications as essential to streamlining decision making processes and shortening response timelines”, according to the report.The PLA also noted progress in “increasing its warfighting readiness” and Communist Party publications “often state that preparing for winning wars is the logical starting point of the PLA’s reforms”. The party publications also praised the PLA for strengthening troop training and preparations, while citing “improvements in key competencies such as mobilising to support China’s responses to the Covid-19 outbreak and floods in central China, and successes in military-civil fusion, particularly in delivering logistics during mobilisation and deterrence exercises along the Indian border in 2020”.The report noted that diplomatic efforts by India and China to resolve the standoff “are making slow progress as both sides resist losing perceived advantages on the border”. The two sides withdrew frontline forces from the north and south banks of Pangong Lake in February and from Gogra in August, they have been unable to make headway on disengagement at other friction points despite numerous rounds of diplomatic and military talks.After the face-off began in May 2020, China and Indian deployed almost 50,000 troops each in Ladakh sector of the LAC. “The PRC (China) blamed the standoff on Indian infrastructure construction, which it perceived to encroach on PRC territory, while India accused the PRC of launching aggressive incursions into India’s territory,” the report said.In June last year, troops from the two sides clashed in Galwan Valley, resulting in the death of 20 Indian soldiers and at least four Chinese troops. This incident was the deadliest clash between the two sides in 45 years. In addition, on September 8, 2020, a PLA patrol fired warning shots at an Indian patrol near Pangong Lake – the first shots fired along the LAC in decades.The report noted that Chinese had “sought to downplay the severity of the crisis, emphasising Beijing’s intent to preserve border stability and prevent the standoff from harming other areas of its bilateral relationship with India”.It added, “The PRC seeks to prevent border tensions from causing India to partner more closely with the United States. PRC officials have warned US officials to not interfere with the PRC’s relationship with India.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-prepared-for-spike-in-border-tensions-with-india-us-defence-dept-report-101636013284862.html

04-11-2021||India||Adi Shankaracharya’s statue to be unveiled at Kedarnath||Adi Guru Shankaracharya’s 12 feet tall statue at Kedarnath, weighing 35 tonnes, has been made by Mysore based sculptors from Chlorite Schist Stone, which is known to withstand rain, sunshine and harsh climate, said tourism officials. The statue, to be unveiled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 5, has been polished with coconut water to bring out its shine, the officials added. The unveiling of the statue will be live-streamed at the rest of the 11 Jyotir Lingas, four maths (monastic institutions) and major Shiva Temples, Uttarakhand chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said. In the 2013 Uttarakhand floods, Adi Guru Shankaracharya’s samadhi (final resting place) next to the Kedarnath temple was washed away. Shankaracharya’s new statue has been installed just behind the Kedarnath temple as part of its reconstruction project. Mysore’s Yogiraj Shilpi, a sculptor rooted in five generation of craftsmanship, completed the work on the new statue with help from his son, Arun. Yogiraj Shilpi was contracted by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) after a nationwide search. Yogiraj started making the statue in September 2020 with around 120 tonnes of stone procured for its carving. The sculpture, which weighs around 35 tonnes, depicts Adi Shankaracharya in a sitting position, said officials. The tourism officials said both the Centre and the state governments were equally committed to the reconstruction of Kedarnath Dham, to be done in phases, for which more than ₹500 crores was sanctioned. Also Read | Won’t protest during Modi visit, promise Kedarnath priests after Dhami’s pledgeState tourism minister Satpal Maharaj said reconstruction works in Kedarnath would not have been possible without the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “We welcome his presence here soon. He will also be inaugurating the second phase of reconstruction works at Shri Kedarnath,” he added Uttarakhand’s tourism secretary Dilip Jawalkar said, “I would like to thank PM Narendra Modi and Jindal Steel Works for their generous efforts towards rebuilding the monument. We are firm that this establishment will not only manifest the belief of devotees in the teachings of this great sage but will also help in getting further tourist footfall in the state.” The Kerala born Adi Shankaracharya was an 8th-century Indian mystic and philosopher who consolidated the doctrine of Advaita Vedanta and made a significant contribution in unifying Hinduism by setting up four mathas (monastic institutions) across India. Uttarakhand Himalayas hold much significance in the context of Adi Shankaracharya as he is said to have taken samadhi here at Kedarnath. It was in Uttarakhand where he established one of the four mathas at Jyotir Math here in Chamoli district and also established the idol at Badrinath.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/adi-shankaracharya-s-statue-to-be-unveiled-at-kedarnath-101636005424223.html

The JioPhone Next runs on Pragati OS, an operating system powered by an “extremely optimised” version of Android which includes other customised features - including translating text on the screen to as many as 10 Indian languages.In a statement, Google and Jio informed that their smartphone will be available on the markets at a cost of only ₹6,499, with multiple equated monthly instalments (EMIs) also available, starting at ₹2,000. The JioPhone Next packs a 5.45-inch Corning Gorilla Glass 3 display with HD+ support. It is powered by a Qualcomm quad-core chipset that can clock up to 1.3GHz, and has 2GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage, which can also be expanded later.Also Read | JioPhone Next isn’t redefining budget Android phones, but EMI bundles add valueThe battery capacity is also decent, with the JioPhone Next packing a 3,500 mAh battery. The phone has a 13-megapixel rear camera with HDR support, and an 8-megapixel front camera with a selfie sensor as well.Google has been trying to expand its outreach in India with budget smartphones for a while, and the JioPhone Next is its latest attempt at establishing its base among the masses - this time with the help of telecom giant Jio, operated by the Reliance group. Sundar Pichai, the chief executive officer of Google, had noted back in 2017 that markets such as India need phones priced at the $30 (around ₹2,233) point to effectively qualify for mass adoption.Also Read | JioPhone Next or Redmi 9A Sport: Which budget smartphone should you pick?Now, with the help of Jio, Google is hoping to help as many as 300 million users in India, who are yet to catch up to technology beyond 2G, upgrade to the smartphone age and faster networks. “I have always been a firm believer in the power of Digital Revolution,” said Mukesh Ambani, chairman and managing director of Reliance Industries, in a statement last month. He added that in the past, the company has “enriched, enabled, and empowered” the lives of 1.35 billion Indians with connectivity. Now, it is doing the same thing but with a smartphone device, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jiophone-next-google-and-jio-s-much-awaited-budget-smartphone-launches-today-details-here-101635990341279.html

With this, petrol prices in Uttarakhand are going down by ₹7 per litre.Thanking the Union government for its decision to reduce the excise duty on fuel prices, Uttarakhand chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said on Wednesday that his government has decided to give the extra relief of ₹2 per litre on petrol (in addition to the ₹5 per litre relief provided by the Centre), thus making petrol cheaper in the state by ₹7 per litre.KarnatakaThe Karnataka government announced that it is going to reduce the VAT on both petrol and diesel prices by ₹7 per litre from November 4. Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai himself made the announcement on Wednesday, taking to his official handle on Twitter.HaryanaThe Haryana government has also reduced VAT on fuel prices in the state.

It also said that the border row along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) resulted in significant force buildup by China's military and establishment or enforcement of forward positions."At the height of the border standoff between the PRC and India in 2020, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) installed a fibre optic network in remote areas of the western Himalayas to provide faster communications and increased protection from foreign interception," the report titled "Military and Security Developments Involving the People's Republic of China 2021" said.This set up gave them access to near-real-time ISR (intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance) and situational data for streamlining decision-making processes and shortening response timelines, the report released on Wednesday further said.The Pentagon regularly reports to the US Congress about various issues, including the India-China border standoff in eastern Ladakh, which began with a skirmish between the two militaries in June last year. Both sides suffered casualties in that incident and have held several rounds of talks to resolve issues but no significant breakthrough has been achieved.The Pentagon report, meanwhile, noted that despite the coronavirus disease pandemic, border clashes with India, and other significant events, the Chinese army in 2020 accelerated its training and fielding of equipment from the already fast pace of recent years.The Pentagon said despite the ongoing diplomatic and military dialogues to reduce border tensions, China has continued "taking incremental and tactical actions" to press its claims at the LAC.It also said that China is indulging in aggressive and coercive behaviour with its neighbours, India in particular.Talking about the build-up of nuclear force, the Pentagon said in its report that China is doing that much faster than US officials predicted just a year ago, which could enable Beijing to match or surpass US global power by mid-century.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pentagon-report-details-how-china-beefed-up-border-infra-in-standoff-with-india-101635985796594.html

The special collectors’ coin, available in a range of standards, including gold and silver, was designed by Heena Glover and features an image of a lotus, India’s national flower, alongside one of Gandhi’s most famous quotes: “My life is my message”.This is the first time Gandhi has been commemorated on an official UK coin, and its release builds on the strong ties and cultural connections between the UK and India. The final design was chosen by Sunak, who is the “Master of the Mint”.Sunak said: “This coin is a fitting tribute to an influential leader who inspired millions around the world... I am proud to unveil this coin during Diwali. Mahatma Gandhi was instrumental in the movement for Indian independence and it is fantastic to have a UK coin commemorating his remarkable life for the first time.” The coin, which goes on sale from November 4, is part of the Royal Mint’s wider Diwali collection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uk-unveils-commemorative-5-coin-marking-mahatma-gandhi-s-legacy-101635985340945.html
04-11-2021||India||India conducts key flight test of anti-airfield weapon||On Diwali eve, the Indian Air Force (IAF) and the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) successfully tested an indigenous smart weapon that can target enemy airfield assets such as radars, bunkers, taxiways and runways, at a firing range in Rajasthan, officials familiar with the development said on Wednesday.This was the second successful test firing of the smart anti-airfield weapon (SAAW) from the Jaguar fighter plane in a week -- it was earlier fired on October 28. The weapon has a range of 100 km.The November 3 test is significant as it involved the imaging infrared seeker technology that exponentially enhances the terminal accuracy of the weapon, said one of the officials cited above. The weapons earlier tested -- SAAW has been test fired around 10 times -- were equipped with GPS-based navigation and terminal guidance systems.“The two different configurations based on satellite navigation and electro optical (EO) sensors have been successfully tested. EO seeker-based flight test of this class of bomb was conducted for the first time in the country. EO configuration of the system is equipped with imaging infrared seeker technology that enhancing the precision strike capability of the weapon,” the defence ministry said in a statement.In both tests, the newly adapted launcher ensured smooth release of the weapon and intended targets were hit with high accuracy, it added.“SAAW is an important tactical weapon whose equivalent glide bombs have thus far been imported. Once inducted, SAAW will fill a critical indigenous capability gap,” said Air Marshal Anil Chopra (retd), director general, Centre for Air Power Studies.The November 3 test came a week after India carried out the latest test of the 5,000 km range Agni-V missile from the APJ Abdul Kalam Island off the Odisha coast, a significant step towards boosting the nuclear deterrence against China.In January 2021, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) announced that a Hawk-i aircraft successfully fired SAAW for the first time off the coast of Odisha. It was seen as a significant boost to an upgrade programme for the Hawk advanced jet trainer operated by IAF and navy.The Hawk-i project (or upgraded Hawk) seeks to equip the trainer jet with combat capabilities through an internally-funded HAL programme. HAL is in talks with IAF and navy for the weaponisation of their Hawks.SAAW has been designed and developed by DRDO’s Research Centre Imarat with support from IAF.Chopra said in recent months, there has been a significant forward movement in the defence indigenisation sector, with the defence ministry clearing a raft of projects. In a needed self-reliance push, India has signed contracts and cleared projects worth almost ₹62,000 crore in less than two months to boost military capability with locally produced weapons and systems including transport planes, tanks, helicopters, airborne early warning systems and counter-drone weapons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-conducts-key-flight-test-of-anti-airfield-weapon-101635984577194.html
04-11-2021||India||Covaxin's shelf life extended to a year||The national drugs regulator has approved increasing the shelf life of Bharat Biotech’s Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin to up to 12 months from the earlier approved nine months, according to people familiar with the development.The extension given by the central drugs standard control organisation (CDSCO) means that the expiration date of the vaccine, has been increased from the date of manufacturing, therefore reducing the risk of vaccine wastage.“The process is, when any drug or a vaccine is given emergency use authorization by the drugs controller general of India, its shelf life is determined by the stability data that is furnished by the manufacturer at that point in time when approval for an EUA is sought. As the drug or the vaccine becomes older, there is addition to the data and further extensions are given on the basis of stability and sterility data,” said a senior health ministry who asked not to be named.Bharat Biotech has submitted updated stability data to the drugs regulator for approval.The company confirmed the news in a statement.“ CDSCO has approved the extension of shelf life of Covaxin up to 12 months, from the date of manufacture. This approval of shelf life extension is based on the availability of additional stability data, which was submitted to CDSCO. The shelf life extension has been communicated to our stakeholders,” said Bharat Biotech in a statement.Covaxin was co-developed by Bharat Biotech and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the extension of the shelf life is based on the stability response of the vaccine vial that is stored at two to eight degrees Celsius.On January 3, this year, Covaxin was granted emergency use authorization, and at that time the shelf life of six months was approved by the drugs regulator. This was subsequently increased to nine months in July, and, on Wednesday, 12 months.In October, Bharat Biotech supplied (6 crore) 60 million doses of Covaxin under the immunisation programme.Gagandeep Kang, vaccine expert from Christian Medical College, Vellore, said “Basically all vaccines start with short expiration dates because the data for stability are from when batches are made for clinical testing. As time goes on, more stability data is collected based on the original batches. If the regulator is okay with the data, expiration can be extended.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covaxins-shelf-life-extended-to-a-year-101635983364794.html

04-11-2021||India||Adi Guru Shankaracharya statute to be unveiled by Modi washed with coconut water||DEHRADUN: The 12-feet tall statue of Adi Guru Shankaracharya, which weighs 35 tonnes, has been made by Mysore-based sculptors from chlorite schist, a rock which is known to withstand rain, sunshine and harsh climate, tourism officials said on Wednesday.The statue at the Kedarnath shrine premises has been polished with coconut water to bring out its shine , they added.Prime Minister Narendra Modi will unveil Shankaracharya’s statue on November 5. The event will be live-streamed to the 11 Jyotir Lingas, four maths (monastic institutions) and major Shiva temples, said chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami.Adi Guru Shankaracharya samadhi was washed away in the 2013 floods. The new statue has been prepared with a special design under the reconstruction works of Kedarnath Dham. It has been built by excavating land just behind the Kedarnath temple and in the middle of the samadhi area, said officials.Mysore sculptor Yogiraj Shilpi, with a legacy of five generations, completed the work on the new statue with help from his son, Arun. Yogiraj was contracted by the Prime Minister’s Office after a nationwide search. Yogiraj started work on making the statue in September 2020.The Kerala-born Adi Shankaracharya was an 8th-century Indian spiritual leader and philosopher who consolidated the doctrine of Advaita Vedanta and made a significant contribution in unifying Hinduism by setting up four mathas (monastic institutions) across India. Uttarakhand’s Himalayas hold much significance in the context of Adi Shankaracharya as he is said to have taken samadhi here at Kedarnath.It was also in Uttarakhand that he established one of the four mathas at Jyotir Math in Chamoli district and also installed an idol at Badrinath.Tourism officials said both Centre and the state government have been on the same page on reconstructing Kedarnath Dham, a project that has been closely tracked by PM Narendra Modi. A total allocation of over ₹ 500 crore was approved and was allocated to be spent in phases for this reconstruction assignment, they added.Uttarakhand tourism minister Satpal Maharaj said reconstruction works in Kedarnath would not have been possible without the vision of PM Modi. “We welcome his presence here soon. He will also be inaugurating the second phase works at Kedarnath.”Secretary tourism Dilip Jawalkar said, “The samadhi of Shankaracharya was destroyed in the 2013 flash flood that hit Kedarnath area. I would like to thank PM Narendra Modi and Jindal Steel Works for their generous efforts towards rebuilding the monument.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/adi-guru-shankaracharya-statute-to-be-unveiled-by-modi-washed-with-coconut-water-101635971223091.html
04-11-2021||India||Won’t protest during Modi visit, promise Kedarnath priests after Dhami’s pledge||DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami on Wednesday promised priests at the Kedarnath shrine that he will resolve issues related to the prickly issue shrine board by this month-end, an assurance aimed at persuading the priests not to go ahead with their protest during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Kedarnath visit on Thursday.The priests had earlier threatened to intensify their protest against the Uttarakhand Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board, the umbrella body formed to regulate shrines and temples under its purview, during PM Modi’s November 5 visit and had gone to the extent of saying that this might even include preventing the prime minister’s entry to the shrine.On Monday, the priests demonstrated how far they were willing to go when they prevented former chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat from stepping into the Kedarnath shrine. The board that they oppose is a legacy of the TS Rawat government.Dhami and his two cabinet colleagues, Subodh Uniyal and Harak Singh Rawat, spoke to representatives of the priest community on Wednesday and assured them that the state government will never hurt their respect and sentiments. The priests were also assured a November-end deadline to resolve the dispute.“We had gone to Kedarnath to check the arrangements ahead of the PM’s visit. Almost all the arrangements have been completed. Never have so many works been undertaken in Kedarnath area like this. We thank Modi ji for this and welcome him here,” the chief minister said after his damage-control mission succeeded.“Following the assurance, they (priests) said they will not hold protests on Modi’s arrival and accord him a warm welcome,” Subodh Uniyal, cabinet minister and spokesperson of the state government, later told reporters.Dhami also met Manohar Kant Dhyani, who is chairman of the high-powered committee formed by the state government on the future of the board, on Tuesday evening. They discussed the concerns raised by the priests.The board was formed under the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Act, 2019, when Trivendra Singh Rawat was the chief minister. Priests have been protesting its existence but the state government has not accepted their demand to abolish it yet.KK Kotiyal, president of the Char Dham Tirath Purohit Haq Haqooki Mahapanchayat, the body of priests that opposes the board, said chief minister Dhami spoke to him and other priests and sought time till November 30 to resolve the matter.“I told him that priests have been betrayed first by Trivendra Singh Rawat, then by Tirath Singh Rawat and now by you (Pushkar Singh Dhami). We were promised that Char Dham Board will be scrapped by October 30. Now because of Modi, you have come here,” Kotiyal said.He, however, added that because they are priests and their main work is to offer prayers and blessings for pilgrims, they will wait till November end.Kotiyal said Kedarnath and Badrinath shrines receive ₹25 to 30 crore donations annually. “There is a wrong perception that priests are looting the donations. All donations used to go to Kedarnath Badrinath temple committee which was been formed in the British era. Priests and pandas only get some money when pilgrims conduct some special prayers or rituals on their own.”The priests already have the support of the opposition Congress and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) which have promised to scrap the board when they come to power in the state.Harish Rawat, former chief minister and senior Congress leader, said Modi should scrap the Char Dham Board before he comes.“If they are not doing it, Congress will do it. Scrapping the Board will be our first decision after we come to power here. The priests are angry over the delay in resolving the matter as had been promised to them,” the senior Congress leader said.Ganesh Godiyal, Uttarakhand unit president, alleged the government wants to manage the money received as donations by these shrines. “They don’t trust the priests. Before Char Dham Board, Kedarnath Badrinath temple committee managed all the Char Dham affairs and the money. The priests were given money by the committee. But many priests also get offerings from devotees. The government wants to control all money inflow in the shrines.”Sanjay Bhatt, AAP state unit spokesperson, said AAP workers staged protests on Wednesday in various parts of the state, demanding immediate scrapping of the Char Dham Board.Badrinath and Kedarnath received offerings of 45 kg gold, over 38 quintal silver and 8100 silver coins since the formation of Uttarakhand in 2000, according to a reply given by the government to an RTI query filed by activist Hemant Gauniya in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wont-protest-during-modi-visit-promise-kedarnath-priests-after-dhami-s-promise-101635969545754.html

The four, who returned to Kerala on October 31, without meeting their relatives, however, denied the charge claiming that in all 11 people including local contacts and other relatives took the same RT-PCR test, but they were singled out by the Uttar Pradesh Police and jailed for violating Covid-19 protocols. They said that since they can’t speak Hindi they had to go through a ‘terrible time in jail’ and the two of the four who were above 60, their routine medication were affected as well. HT is not revealing the identities of the four in order to protect the identity of the minor. The three women had come to Uttar Pradesh to meet their two releatives, who was arrested by the UP Police earlier this year on terror charges, alleged members of the Popular Front of India, a controversial outfit. A relative of the four said that they had first gone to the Gosaiganj police station in Lucknow on September 24 after being told that their kin will be produced in court, and they could meet them there. After spending the whole day at the police station they were told that the accused will be produced in the court virtually. Next day, they were advised to go to the jail after taking RT-PCR tests and they subsequently submitted the reports at the district jail. The relative said that on September 25 they were picked up from the hotel they were staying and the arrest was recorded two days later. They were booked under Sections 419 and 420 of the Indian Penal Code after a complaint was filed by prison officer Ajay Raj at the Gosaiganj police station. “They said they had a tough time as police officers intimidated and threatened them. Though they knew they don’t understand Hindi they frequently asked questions in Hindi. They said only two women constables were present when they were picked up from their hotel,” the relative said. “First five days they were kept in a Covid-19 observation centre and they even failed to get proper food and were forced to wear the same dress for five days or so. Once they were shifted to the women jail; things turned normal,” the relative said. The relative said that a bail application was moved in a local court on September 29, which was turned down since several non-bailable provisions were added in the case. Another application was moved on October 20 at the chief judicial magistrate court and bail was finally granted. The relative said that the bail provisions were so strict that they had to furnish six sureties for three women and property documents worth ₹50,000. “There were strict verifications of documents in the police station and later at revenue offices. It took us 10 days to clear them,” the relative said, adding they were finally released on October 31 evening. “The mother told me that they were not even treated as human beings,” the relative added. The UP Police, however, denied the charges. Gosaiganj assistant commissioner of police (ACP) Shweta Chowdhary said, “The FIR was lodged on the basis of an enquiry conducted by the jail administration. The investigation officer of the case has been asked to submit an explanation for delay in the probe.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/women-minor-spend-36-days-in-jail-over-fake-covid-test-101635965760834.html
04-11-2021||India||‘Need to measure climate damage in monetary terms’: UN special rapporteur||The United Nations special rapporteur on human rights and the environment, David Boyd, has said that new taxes on air travel and maritime shipping could raise money needed to compensate countries for “loss and damage” associated with extreme climate events. Loss and damage refers to the impacts of both extreme events such super cyclones, and slow onset events such as sea level rise. Vulnerable countries have been asking for these events to be compensated by the highest emitters, and the issue of loss and damage will be discussed at COP26.In Glasgow, small islands such as Antigua, Barbuda and Tuvalu have agreed to establish a Commission of Small Island States on Climate Change and International Law for legal redressal of climate impacts. These developments are important for India, which has decided to support strong rules on loss and damage.Boyd said an interview to HT that loss and damage should be measured in monetary terms now.Edited excerpts:You have proposed levies on air travel and shipping to generate funding for adaptation and loss and damage. What has been the response of UNFCCC to your proposal?No response thus far, but this is an acid test for the success of COP26 after decades of wealthy nations ducking and delaying.Why did you zero in on these two sectors and not other industries?Air travel and shipping are the focus because these are the industries identified in previous proposals for levies put forward by Small Island Developing States. The two industries are major polluters (combined emissions equal to all the emissions by South America), and since their emissions are not counted in national emissions inventories, are largely unregulated. They also largely benefit wealthy people who can afford to pay small levies. These two levies combined could easily raise tens to hundreds of billions of dollars annually.Do you think developed countries will accept a polluter pays principle like this?Yes, because these levies are a new source of climate finance that do not require governments to find the money in their budgets. Also, there is huge pressure to boost climate finance to address the rapidly escalating impacts of the climate crisis.What exactly is the provision of loss and damage?Loss and damage refers to the economic costs of damage inflicted by climate disasters as well as the non-economic damages like pain and suffering. To use a concrete example, the small Caribbean nation of Dominica has been hit by two Category 5 hurricanes in recent years, damaging over 90% of buildings, wrecking infrastructure, and inflicting costs larger than the whole country’s annual GDP. The people of Dominica are not responsible for the climate crisis but are on the front lines of adverse impacts of climate chaos. It is unjust to expect them to pay for the repairs and rebuilding. On the other hand, it is just for the wealthy nations who caused the crisis to pay for the loss and damage.Do you think there will be progress on loss and damage during cop 26? What are your expectations?Progress is vital but must be measured in billions of dollars this year and next, not just processes and future promises. Climate vulnerable countries have been waiting for almost thirty years for loss and damage funding to flow from North to South.What are the various legal means that vulnerable countries can access to claim losses?At present there are none. No vulnerable nation has been compensated for the loss and damage they have already suffered.Has climate attribution science made it easier to claim legal damage?The improving precision of climate attribution increases the probability that the major polluters, both nations and corporations, will be held liable one day for their outsized contributions to the climate crisis, just as increased attribution of respiratory illnesses, heart disease and cancer to smoking resulted in tobacco companies eventually being held liable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/interview-need-to-measure-climate-damage-in-monetary-terms-david-boyd-un-special-rapporteur-101635965283083.html
04-11-2021||India||Universities told to translate all literature into Indian languages||The Centre has asked all universities in the country to translate their learning material and literature into all Indian languages as a part of the government’s Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav (AKAM) celebration to mark 75 years of India’s independence. The universities have been asked to chalk out plans with a timeline by November 20, according to a letter to them from University Grants Commission secretary Rajnish Jain dated November 2. The letter is a follow-up to the decision, which was taken during a meeting chaired by Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan on August 31 to review the events being planned by his ministry under AKAM. “One of the actionable plans identified under the ongoing celebration was to translate the existing learning material and literature in all Indian languages. It has also been recommended by the national education policy (NEP) 2020,” a senior official in the education said, asking not to be named.Jain’s letter, addressed to the vice chancellors of all universities, including central and state universities and private universities, asked them to come up with a plan and timeline and send it to the commission by November 20. “As you are aware, the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 also emphasises on expanding India’s translation and interpretation efforts in order to make high quality learning materials and other important written and spoken material available to the public in various Indian languages. Such an activity would give students and faculty both a sense of unity and the beautiful cultural heritage and diversity of India.” Officials at several universities said they will discuss the matter in the coming days. “It will be a massive task to translate each and every thing available in English or any other language into other Indian languages. We will have to plan it strategically. We will conduct a meeting with university officials and decide how to go ahead with the task,” said a senior official at the Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi.An official in Delhi University also said they will discuss the plan with their colleagues and come up with a plan. A senior official at Jamia Millia Islamia said, “We welcome the step. But we can only chalk out the plan after getting more details on it.”A second senior education ministry official said that the National Mission on Education through Information and Communication Technology (NMEICT), a centrally funded initiative, has also been translating existing digital study material for higher education institutions in regional languages. “It’s not possible to teach in regional languages in central universities catering to the students from across the country. Therefore, it is very important to have study material available in all local or regional languages available at least in online format. The NMEICT is doing that work and it has almost translated the online study material available for first year students,” added this person.This year, for the first time, the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) has given approval to 20 engineering colleges across 10 states to offer select undergraduate courses in six regional languages. The AICTE also translated study material in these six regional languages.NEP 2020 advocates teaching in the mother tongue up to Class 5, and suggests that textbooks shall be made available in local languages/mother tongue. For higher education institutions, NEP 2020 recommends the use of mother tongue/local language as a medium of instruction, and bilingual programmes in order to increase access and also to promote the strength, usage, and vibrancy of all Indian languages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/universities-told-to-translate-all-literature-into-indian-languages-101635965040136.html

According to police, the seventh class student was suffering from a high fever for three days, and instead of taking her to the hospital, they took her to a local Imam, who is also an occult practitioner, and treated her with prayers and ritual water. On Monday morning, she was rushed to a local hospital where doctors declared the girl was brought dead. The issue came to light after some of the relatives alerted police, saying the girl was forced to chant religious hymns and given blows to heal her illness. Parents were in a rush to bury the body, but after complaints, the police intervened. “We have arrested the father and a local Imam in connection with the death of an 11-year-old. Cases will be registered under the juvenile justice act and culpable homicide,” said district police superintendent R Ilango. He said the police would also inquire into four more deaths in the family in recent years. Many relatives and locals also raised charges against the Imam. The post-mortem revealed that severe respiratory infection led to her death, and she could have been saved had she gotten timely medical help, the police said. Police further said they would also interrogate some of the Imam followers. The tragic death of a girl, hailing from a middle-class family, has sent shockwaves across the state. In 2019, the state government had passed a bill in the assembly, Kerala prevention and eradication of evil practices, sorcery and black magic bill, to award stringent punishment for such offences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/occult-practitioner-the-father-held-for-minor-girl-s-death-in-north-kerala-101635964920614.html

The body was found kept in a gunny bag with his hands and legs tied. Police are yet to identify the deceased, but senior officers said they have some leads about his identity. “The body was found by rag pickers, who saw the gunny bag. When we inspected, we found a body with the hands and legs tied. His nose and mouth were closed with adhesive tape as well. This is a clear case of murder,” said a Rajarajeshwari Nagar police official. Police said the man appears to have been either strangled or smothered. “There are some signs of struggle but the cause of death will be identified only after the post-mortem. Our teams are looking at CCTV cameras in the areas to identify the vehicle that was used to bring the body. From our initial investigation, the murder has taken place else and the body was dumped here,” said the official. The victim is said to be aged between 20-25 years “We are yet to ascertain his identity. We have sent his pictures to all police stations to see if there was any missing complaint. At the same time, we have a lead on his identity which our teams are trying to verify. We will try to crack it at the earliest” said a senior officer. Rajarajeshwari police said that all angles of the case will be probed but the priority is to identify the victim. On September 28, Belagavi police had found body of a 25-year-old in a similar manner. In the investigation that followed, 10 people including the leaders of a Hindu right-wing organization were arrested for murdering the Muslim youth for being in a relationship with a Hindu girl. The girl’s parents were also arrested. The youth was murdered in Belagavi city and later his body was dumped on the railway track to make it look like an accident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengaluru-man-s-body-found-in-bag-with-limbs-tied-101635964804178.html

Though department in a statement on Wednesday didn’t name the group of companies but said that they were engaged in the civil construction of roads and irrigation projects. The raids were conducted on October 28 in various locations in north Karnataka, read the statement from the I-T department. “The search operation has revealed that this group has been suppressing its profits by booking bogus expenses in the purchase of materials, labor expenses and payment to subcontractors,” the statement stated. Adding that various incriminating documents including digital evidence indicating non-genuine claim of such expenses have been found and seized the raid, the I-T department said: “Analysis of the same (digital evidence) shows that unaccounted cash has been received by the key group person from such vendors/ suppliers of materials,” the statement added. The I-T department also claimed that these owners of these companies used their own relatives/friends/employees conduits in the name of subcontractors who neither executed any work nor did they have the capability to execute the work. “The assessee group has been generating unaccounted cash from these transactions. The search action has led to the detection of unaccounted income of more than Rs. 70 crore which has been admitted as undisclosed income by the assessee group,” the I-T department claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-dept-detects-unaccounted-income-of-rs-70-crore-after-raids-on-business-group-101635964802318.html

The headmistress, who is also the class teacher for Standard IV, was shifted to another middle school run by the Greater Chennai Municipal Corporation while it awaits a formal response from her.“She should have received the notice yesterday (Tuesday). The procedure is to give her seven days to explain what had happened and why it had happened,” said a civic official of the education department who IS in charge of the case.The corporation has not received any complaints from parents on this issue. “But we acted after the school education commissioner received a complaint after the school register began circulating on WhatsApp,” the officer quoted above said on condition of anonymity. “From our enquiries so far with the school, we are given to understand that the teachers maintained a list of the students’ castes so that they could avail of government schemes meant for the marginalised school students.”Other teachers at the school have been warned against following such a practice.Confirming the same, deputy commissioner for education of the Greater Chennai Corporation, D Sneha, said that from a preliminary inquiry, it seemed inadvertent on the part of the teacher, but it is true that students were separated based on their castes into three categories. The class register, a copy of which is with HT, shows the names of students of class four assorted by the terms Scheduled Castes (SC), Backward Class (BC) and Most Backward Class (MBC).“Whether intentionally or unintentionally, the teacher has named the communities of the children and they have been numbered as per their community and split into three batches,” said Sneha. Each batch was a group of students belonging to the same community. “We are looking at whether this was caste-based segregation,” said Sneha.The state government has not reacted to the issue. However, caste pride and discrimination inside classrooms have been commonplace in the state. In 2019, it was found that in rural Tamil Nadu several schools used coloured wristbands for students to identify them by their caste. Following this, the director of school education had instructed officials to identify and act against such schools.“Marriage and elections have kept caste alive,” said social and political activist Senthil Arumugam. “Both the DMK and AIADMK use anti-caste rhetoric, but it is not being practised in spirit. They field candidates based on the caste composition of the constituencies. So, this is a small incident that has happened because serious steps haven’t been taken to eradicate caste.”Arumugam said that alphabets or random numbers should have been used to rotate students in class. “Now the school has induced in the minds of children that things function by caste, and they will be separated by caste. The purpose of education is to move away from caste. It’s shocking that this has happened in a state like Tamil Nadu where Periyar (EV Ramasamy, known as the father of the Dravidian movement) was known for social justice.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/headmistress-in-tamil-nadu-sorts-students-based-on-caste-101635964800706.html
04-11-2021||India||Puneeth Rajkumar and the limits of stardom||This Deepavali is a quiet and sombre one in Bengaluru, not only because of Covid-- its long shadow is finally fading-- but because of the sad and untimely death of Kannada superstar Puneeth Rajkumar at age 46.“Look at these crowds,” said a hardened news reporter, filming the hundreds of thousands of weeping fans who had gathered. “To touch so many lives so deeply is something amazing.”The death of a Bollywood actor does this-- we know. But Puneeth Rajkumar seemed to wear his fame lighter than most. Perhaps it was being born as the son of Rajkumar, a legend and icon in Karnataka. Perhaps, it was being the youngest son in a joint family of 30 people. Whatever the reason, the word that most people use to describe the “power star” is “humble.” You can see it in the movie clips that are currently playing on loop on Twitter. There is a lovely one made by Hombale Films, in which fans are describing how they watch Puneeth’s films-- first-day first show for many. As they talk, Puneeth quietly walks up behind them and ad-libs a phrase. “Will you give me a ticket to see the movie with you?” he mutters. The woman fan turns to find her matinee idol standing behind. He grins, she screams, they shake hands. You can see the delight in both parties.Beyond the crowds, beyond the condolences from Prime Minister Modi, to Sadhguru to Sanjay Dutt to Virendra Sehwag to pretty much everyone in the Kannada film fraternity, one news item stood out: the fact that two fans died of a heart attack when they heard about Puneeth’s death. Now, a fan can commit suicide, as some did when they heard of MGR’s death in Tamilnadu. But to die of a heart attack (of natural causes) requires you to be so linked to this actor emotionally that the grief of his passing is quite heart-breaking. That, if true, tells us that Puneeth Rajkumar had an emotional resonance with his fans that few can equal. Part of the reason for the shock is of course that Puneeth died tragically young-- he was just 46. Also, the fact that he seemed fit.There is a fake message, ostensibly from Dr Devi Shetty, another denizen of Karnataka that is making the rounds. It talks about people who are seemingly fit-- like Puneeth was, who take exercising every day to the extreme-- Puneeth allegedly died after working out for two hours in his gym. The message ends with the cheery call for moderation. Eat what your ancestors did, and exercise in moderation, the message said. Fake though it is, the message resonated with many, including me, partly because all of us have lost friends and family who are ridiculously young in this pandemic, and not just because of Covid. The truth is that I know four people who died young in the last year, all of them because of a heart attack. When people die young, the public post-mortem includes their lifestyle. Puneeth was known to be a fitness fiend, and suddenly, that is being called in question. A friend of mine cancelled a marathon because he is exactly Puneeth’s age (46) and his wife is freaked out by his “extreme fitness” as she calls it.To me, the message in Puneeth Rajkumar’s death is not about altering your lifestyle or your fitness routine. It isn’t even about moderation or being careful about what proteins or steroids or muscle relaxants you take. It is the limits of human intervention and being humble about what you can control. People say that the only certain things are death and taxes. To that shortlist, I add pain. The one thing that lies in your future and mine is heartbreak. Some months ago, our family endured the loss of a young person-- also of a heart attack. It was horrible, unfair and heartbreaking. We are still reconciling with this loss-- just as Puneeth’s wife, Ashwini and his two daughters, Vanditha and Drithi will in the coming months and years. It is easy to say that pain is and will always be part of the human condition. But living through it is hard because this pain will hit you when you are least expecting it. How then to make sense of it? Well, our ancients tried to view pain as a pathway to the higher self. When the human ego is beaten, they said, the soul instantly recognizes this as an opportunity to shed what is no longer needed. When the heart is broken, the soul is released from its prior constellations. It begins the ancient process of dissolution, dismemberment, and new life. Rebirth. This is not a comfortable process. But it is a necessary one. Not all of us get to do it. Puneeth’s family will have to.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/puneeth-rajkumar-and-the-limits-of-stardom-101635964742546.html

Ella also thanked the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the Pune-based National Institute of Virology (NIV) for their partnership.On Wednesday, the EUL was granted to Covaxin by the WHO after facing several setbacks leading up to it. Bharat Biotech had applied for the EUL back in April, and the process has been getting delayed since then owing to the health agency needing additional data.In a series of tweets, the WHO said that Covaxin was given a go-ahead to be inoculated to individuals aged 18 and above, following a meeting convened by its technical advisory group. The Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) has also approved the India-made vaccine in two doses, with a gap of 14 or more days between the two.“Covaxin was found to have 78% efficacy against Covid-19 of any severity…and is extremely suitable for low-and-middle-income countries due to easy storage requirements,” WHO tweeted.#Covaxin was found to have 78% efficacy against #COVID19 of any severity, 14 or more days after the second dose, and is extremely suitable for low- and middle-income countries due to easy storage requirements.After the WHO approval was announced, several ministers and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders thanked PM Narendra Modi. Mandaviya said that the nod is a “sign of capable leadership” and the story of “Modiji’s resolution.”Also Read | 'Diwali of Aatmanirbhar Bharat': Health minister hails PM Modi for Covaxin's WHO approval“This is the language of the faith of Indians.

04-11-2021||India||WHO gives Covaxin its stamp of approval||The World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday granted emergency use listing (EUL) to Bharat Biotech’s Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin, the UN health body announced, putting its stamp of approval on the safety and efficacy of India’s indigenous vaccine, and also endorsing the manufacturing abilities of its maker.The approval, which comes after a long wait, will allow for a larger recognition of Covaxin by other countries to allow Indian travellers who have taken the dose to qualify for exemptions that countries offer to those vaccinated.“WHO has granted emergency use listing (EUL) to #COVAXIN® (developed by Bharat Biotech), adding to a growing portfolio of vaccines validated by WHO for the prevention of #COVID19,” WHO said in a tweet.Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya thanked WHO for the EUL.“This is a sign of a capable leadership. This is the story of Modi ji’s resolve. This is the language of the faith of the countrymen. This is a Diwali of self-reliant India. Thanking @WHO for granting emergency use listing (EUL) to Made-in-India #Covaxin,” he tweeted on Wednesday.The vaccine was co-developed by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), which comes under the Union health ministry.The Technical Advisory Group (TAG), an independent advisory committee of the World Health Organisation, recommended Covaxin for EUL in its meeting on Wednesday, followed by WHO evaluating Covaxin’s clinical trial data for grant of EUL. The approval came after a request for additional information that the committee sought from Bharat Biotech. It first considered Bharat Biotech’s request for an EUL for Covaxin on October 26. “The Technical Advisory Group, convened by WHO and made up of regulatory experts from around the world, has determined that the #Covaxin vaccine meets WHO standards for protection against #COVID19, that the benefit of the vaccine far outweighs risks & the vaccine can be used across the planet,” read another tweet by WHO.Millions of Indians and the government have been watching the process, which was expected to reach some sort of conclusion by the end of October.Bharat Biotech welcomed the decision.“The Emergency Use Listing approval by WHO validates the international safety and quality standards of COVAXIN®. Bharat Biotech is motivated to mitigate the worldwide pandemic,” the firm tweeted.Later, in a statement, it said that countries can now expedite their regulatory approval processes to import and administer Covaxin, and Unicef, pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) and GAVI COVAX facility, will now be able to procure the vaccine for distribution to countries worldwide.“Validation by WHO is a very significant step towards ensuring global access to India’s widely administered, safe, and efficacious Covaxin. As an organization, we have focused on maintaining stringent quality and safety standards that meet rigorous assessment, and scientific standards established by WHO, as a result, many of our vaccines have received WHO prequalification. The EUL authorisation for Covaxin will enable us to contribute to accelerating the equitable access of Covid-19 vaccine, and the access to our vaccine globally thereby addressing the current public health emergency,” said Krishna Ella, chairman and managing director, Bharat Biotech.Covaxin was approved for emergency use in India on January 3. Around 10% of the 1.07 billion doses administered so far in the country are of Covaxin.The grant of EUL will also make the vaccine eligible for distribution to low and middle income countries under the COVAX facility of WHO and GAVI, the vaccine alliance, which aims to make free vaccines available to the poorest countries.TAG-EUL is an independent advisory group that provides recommendations to WHO on whether a Covid-19 vaccine can be listed for emergency use under the EUL procedure. Emergency-use listing is a thorough exercise undertaken by WHO and the technical advisory group of independent experts to determine if a manufactured product, in this case Covaxin, is quality-assured, safe and effective or not.“The TAG gave its recommendations in Covaxin’s favour, and WHO Geneva granted the approval. It was on the expected lines,” said a senior central government official aware of the development, on condition of anonymity.Earlier, Covaxin was also reviewed by WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE), which recommended its use in two doses, with a dose interval of four weeks, in all age groups 18 and above.Bharat Biotech was stuck in a regulatory loop, with independent technical experts of the UN health body taking longer to analyse the data that previously disclosed timelines. WHO’s independent technical advisory group, in its meeting on October 26, sought additional clarifications from the company for Covaxin to conduct a final risk-benefit assessment for Emergency Use Listing of the vaccine.Bharat Biotech on Friday submitted the additional data that included immunogenicity response in people 60 years and above, and also separately in both men and women.Earlier, a decision on Covaxin EUL was expected on October 5, after WHO representatives sought additional information on September 27.Covaxin has shown 77.8% effectiveness against the disease, and 65.2% protection against the new highly transmissible delta variant. Covaxin is an inactivated whole virion vaccine. Countries that recognised Covaxin for travel before WHO EUL include Australia, Mauritius, Iran, Nepal, Oman, Mexico, and Greece.However, WHO has not recommended Covaxin use in pregnant women, saying more studies are required on the subject.“Available data on vaccination of pregnant women with the #Covaxin vaccine are insufficient to assess vaccine safety or efficacy in pregnancy; studies in pregnant women are planned, including a pregnancy sub-study and a pregnancy registry,” WHO said in a tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/who-gives-covaxin-its-stamp-of-approval-101635964380920.html
04-11-2021||India||Karnataka:Challenges, hurdles mark 100 days of Bommai at the helm||Bengaluru The Basavaraj Bommai government will complete 100 days in power on Thursday, however the road leading to it was not so smooth as the chief minister had to face dissent from within the party, pressure from the Panchamasalis over reservation, infrastructure issues and the recently concluded bypolls in two constituencies. Bommai was a surprise choice to replace BS Yediyurappa who was forced to step down on July 26 after nearly two years of uncertainty.“(There is) nothing special in 100 days but we will share what we have done during this time. 100 days is not like some benchmark like one year. During this time, how our government is moving forward, what problems we are facing is something we will share with the people,” Bommai said on Wednesday in Bengaluru.The problems Bommai referred to possibly includes the challenges he faces from within his own party’s state leadership who felt “betrayed” for being overlooked for that top job with a person who joined the BJP just 13 years ago as against those who have grown up in the party and spent decades building it.Bommai’s 100-day benchmark comes a day after he suffered a humiliating defeat in his own backyard after Srinivas Mane of the Congress defeated Shivaraj Sajjanar of the BJP in Hanagal in the chief minister’s home district of Haveri.A section within the BJP says that the defeat was engineered by some leaders themselves as they did not want to enhance Bommai’s image in front of the national leadership.A Bengaluru-based analyst said that there was little to suggest that any one person or section of leaders could pull off such a stunt to bring down the party to settle personal scores.“In a bypoll such tactics become harder as there is extensive focus on just a couple of constituencies and it is more difficult to pull off such stunts,” said one analyst, requesting not to be named.The simmering dissent within the leadership boiled over when union home minister Amit Shah projected Bommai as the next chief ministerial candidate on September 2 in Davangere.Bommai has also been unsuccessful in emerging out of the shadows of Yediyurappa who is still believed to hold the reins of the government. Most of Yediyurappa’s loyalists were inducted in the Cabinet while all his detractors were kept out.Bommai continues to rely on Yediyurappa for his day-to-day operations and BJP president Nalin Kumar Kateel, in a recent statement, had said that the party will head to the next elections under the leadership of the incumbent chief minister and his predecessor.The chief minister is also under pressure over the Panchamasali agitation, demanding to be moved up to 2A category in the state reservation list.Vijayananda Kashappanavar, former Congress MLA and president of the Akhila Bharatha Lingayata Panchamasali Mahasabha said that the BJP is yet to heed to its reservation request.“We have already started mobilising support at the grama panchayat level and will not stop until we the order of the reservation reaches the district and local offices,” Kashappanavar said.An influential seer of the Panchamasalis, the largest sub-sect under the Lingayats, had even issued a veiled threat ahead of the October 30 bypolls, asking that the report of reservation be brought from the backward classes commission.The sub-sect have given three months to the Bommai government to heed to its demands or that they will revive the agitation again. Even the marginalised and backward communities have approached the courts to release the findings of the 2015 caste census and block any proposal to allow the Panchamasalis into the 2A category which would further deny benefits to groups who have long since lost out due to the presence of dominant communities within their categories.But one of the bigger challenges staring Bommai is the allegations levelled by Congress Siddaramaiah over purchases of Bitcoins to the tune of several thousand crores.“He (Siddaramaiah) has made the allegations so he should reveal any proof if he has. Secondly we have filed the chargesheet in court and it is a public document,” Bommai said on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnatakachallenges-hurdles-mark-100-days-of-bommai-at-the-helm-101635964336909.html
04-11-2021||India||Karnataka minister slams Congress over Bitcoin scam allegations||Bengaluru: Hitting back at the Congress over its allegation that senior BJP leader were involved in ‘Bitcoin scam’, Karnataka home minister Araga Jnanendra on Wednesday claimed that it was Congress leaders are the ones who are involved in such scam. This comes even as Karnataka chief minister denies knowledge of any scam involving cryptocurrency. Talking to reporters Jnanendra on Wednesday denied Congress’ accusation of the opposition that the ruling BJP is shielding influential people in the case. “Hacker Sriki was caught in an incident in UB City (a popular mall) in 2018. Why did the then CM Siddaramaiah not get him arrested? Why did he not arrest and hold an inquiry when two Congress leaders were caught along with third children,” he said without elaborating on the allegation. “When we caught Sriki in the drugs scandal, we came to know that he is involved in the Bitcoin scam also. So we have recommended an inquiry by Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Interpol,” he added. It was an ED probe into an 11-month-old case in Bengaluru involving a cryptocurrency hacker Sri Krishna alias Sriki that snowballed into a political controversy with the Opposition accusing the ruling BJP of a cover-up last week. Opposition leader Siddaramaiah told the media that two influential politicians were involved and there was an attempt to cover up their role in the case. 25-year-old Srikrishna had allegedly hacked into three bitcoin exchanges, multiple online poker applications, and one government e-procurement website. Bitcoins worth ₹9 crore were recovered from him, which he had either stolen using data theft or through online extortion. He is also accused in the case of stealing ₹11 crore from the e-procurement portal. Srikrishna was caught on November 18 after police arrested some drug dealers, to whom he had allegedly sold drugs procured from the dark web. Srikrishna graduated in computer science from a college in Amsterdam in the Netherlands in 2017. A senior police officer said Srikrishna would encrypt data and demand payment from owners for the site to be unlocked by attacking the sites online, apart from using cryptocurrency for money laundering. Srikrishna was questioned recently by the ED in connection with a case registered earlier this year by the agency into the alleged hacking of accounts of bitcoin holders between 2018 and 2020, and the encashment of the bitcoins by the hawala route after-sale to third parties. Meanwhile, Congress leader Siddaramiah has demanded that chief minister Basavaraj Bommai make the names of politicians allegedly involved in the Bitcoin scam public, irrespective of which party they belong to. “Let it be Congress or BJP, it does not matter. People should know the truth. I have information about politicians being involved in this scam. If there is no case, why did the CM hand it over the case to ED?” he asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-minister-slams-congress-over-bitcoin-scam-allegations-101635964329150.html
04-11-2021||India||On Diwali eve, Centre slashes petrol price by ₹5, diesel by ₹10||The Union government on Wednesday announced reduction in central levies on petrol by ₹5 a litre and diesel by ₹10 a litre from Thursday, providing major relief to consumers amid spiralling fuel prices, even as it urged states to further bring down the rates.From Thursday – when Diwali will be celebrated – the price of petrol will come down from the current rate of over ₹110 a litre in Delhi to about ₹105. The diesel rate will be reduced from over ₹98 per litre to about ₹88. To be sure, there may be minor variations depending on global oil prices and if there are any additional cuts by state governments.“The decision was announced immediately after the Prime Minister gave his nod to providing relief to consumers, tame inflation and boost growth,” an official with direct knowledge of the matter said, asking not to be named.Announcing the decision on Wednesday evening, the Union finance ministry said: “Government of India has taken a significant decision of reducing Central Excise Duty on petrol and diesel by ₹5 and ₹10 (per litre) respectively from tomorrow.”“States are also urged to commensurately reduce VAT [value-added tax] on petrol and diesel to give relief to consumers,” it added.Central excise on petrol, which is currently ₹32.90 per litre, will be reduced to ₹27.90 on Thursday, and the levy on diesel will be reduced from ₹31.80 to ₹21.80, an executive in state-run oil marketing company said on condition of anonymity. “As these taxes are specific and not ad valorem, the entire excise duty reduction will be immediately passed on to the consumer,” he said.Taking cue from the Centre, Assam, Goa, Karnataka and Tripura governments announced ₹7 per litre reduction in state levies (value-added tax) with immediate effect. Bihar also announced ₹1.30 per litre reduction in VAT on petrol and ₹1.90 on diesel.The increase in fuel prices was criticised by opposition parties, which linked the decision to recent bypoll results in which the Opposition made inroads in some key areas, and demanded that the government reduce excise duty further.Domestic prices of petrol and diesel have been surging to record levels almost every day since October 1 because of two key reasons – surging international oil prices due to prolonged supply squeeze by producers’ cartel, and high incidence of central and state taxes on the two fuels. On Wednesday, petrol was being sold in Delhi for ₹110.04 and diesel for ₹98.42.The reduction is the highest ever in excise duty and rolls back a part of the ₹13 and ₹16 per litre increase in taxes on petrol and diesel effected between March 2020 and May 2020 to avoid passing on to consumers the sharp fall in international oil prices.“I thank PM Narendra Modi for the significant reduction in Excise Duty on Petrol & Diesel. A big relief for fuel consumers, particularly our farmers just ahead of Rabi season. The states should add to this celebration by reducing VAT on fuel to give further relief to consumers,” Union petroleum minister Hardeep Singh Puri tweeted.Through 2020, as global crude prices plunged (below $20 a barrel in April last year), the central government raised excise duty on fuel to shore up its finances. States, too, followed suit as their revenues were hit on account of the Covid-19 pandemic. As a result, the central excise and state VAT (which is ad valorem) on petrol and diesel went up to 53% and 46.9% of their respective retail prices.State-run oil companies are expecting petrol and diesel rates to go down further if the producers’ cartel – Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (together known as OPEC+) – on Thursday decides to increase output to calm oil prices under international pressure. At Glasgow on Tuesday, US President Joe Biden blamed OPEC for the current surge in oil and gas prices because of supply squeeze.Ahead of the OPEC+ meeting and a jump in the US crude stockpile, international oil prices slumped. Benchmark Brent crude fell 3.19% at $82.02 per barrel in the Wednesday session.“If OPEC+ decides to raise output, international oil prices will fall further and retail prices of petrol and diesel could be reduced by more than ₹5 and ₹10 [per litre respectively]. Public sector oil marketing companies will be happy to pass on the benefit of falling oil prices to the consumers immediately as government is also keen to check inflation,” the official quoted in the first instance said.The official said the fiscal impact of the excise duty reduction would be about ₹50,000 crore in the current financial year, which could be compensated to a great extent by robust Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections. GST revenue in October surged to ₹1.3 lakh crore, the second highest since the new tax was launched in July 2017. Even the highest GST collection was reported in April this year at ₹1.41 lakh crore and the trend is expected to continue in the festive months of November and December on rapid economic recovery after the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, and increased compliance.“The reduction in excise duty on petrol and diesel will also boost consumption and keep inflation low, thus helping the poor and middle classes. Today’s decision is expected to further spur the overall economic cycle,” the finance ministry said in its statement.In recent months, crude oil prices have witnessed a global upsurge. Consequently, domestic prices of petrol and diesel increased in recent weeks, exerting inflationary pressure, it said. “The world has also seen shortages and increased prices of all forms of energy. The Government of India has made efforts to ensure that there is no energy shortage in the country and that commodities such as petrol and diesel are available adequately to meet our requirements,” it added.“The reduction in excise duty on diesel will be double that of petrol. The Indian farmers have, through their hard work, kept the economic growth momentum going even during the lockdown phase and the massive reduction in excise on diesel will come as a boost to the farmers during the upcoming Rabi season,” it said. The move is also to give a further fillip to the economy, it added.While petrol is above ₹100-a-litre-mark in all major cities, diesel has crossed that level in more than one-and-a-half dozen states. The total increase in petrol price since the May 5, 2020, decision of the government to raise excise duty to record levels now totals ₹38.78 per litre. Diesel rates have during this period gone up by ₹29.03 per litre.The Opposition, however, said more needed to be done.“After losing 14 bye elections & 2 Lok Sabhas, reducing Petrol-Diesel price by ₹5 & ₹10 is tom-tommed as ‘Diwali Gift’ of Modi Ji!” tweeted Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala.Trinamool Congress leader Derek O’Brien said: “Happy Diwali for Government of India. Last year, excise duty on petrol INCREASED by 65% but now decreased by 15%. Between Apr-Sept ‘21, Govt’s collection from excise on petrol ROSE 33% compared to last year. Collection of excise is 79% more than pre-Covid levels.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-diwali-eve-centre-slashes-petrol-price-by-5-diesel-by-10-101635964200813.html
04-11-2021||India||Vaccines to data: India made push on issues key to developing countries||India made a strong push on key issues that are important to developing countries, including data, vaccines and climate change, while shaping the outcomes of the G20 Summit.At the summit held in Rome during October 30-31, the grouping of the world’s 20 largest economies was focused on data free flow with trust and cross-border data flows. India brought the issue of data for development into the Rome Declaration, issued at the end of the summit, as an important point for developing countries, people familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity.“We acknowledge the importance of data free flow with trust and cross-border data flows. We reaffirm the role of data for development. We will continue to work on addressing challenges such as those related to privacy, data protection, security and intellectual property rights, in accordance with the relevant applicable legal frameworks,” the Rome Declaration said.It added that the G20 states will push for common understanding and work to identify “commonalities, complementarities and elements of convergence between existing regulatory approaches and instruments” to enable the flow of data with trust to foster future interoperability.In the field of climate action, India pushed for the inclusion of “critical enablers”, such as sustainable and responsible consumption and production and provision of finance and technology for climate action, into the Rome Declaration. These critical enablers are seen as key to achieving the climate goals, first decided under the Paris Accord, by developing countries that need more finance and green technologies, the people cited above said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi also made a personal push by highlighting the need for sustainable lifestyles, which found resonance in the Rome Declaration.On the issue of phasing out coal as part of efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions, India’s suggestion of not financing unabated coal-powered plants, rather than phasing out coal completely, was accepted, the people said.Unabated coal power generation refers to the use of coal that is not mitigated with technologies to reduce CO2 emissions, such as “carbon capture utilisation and storage”.In the field of Covid-19 vaccines and post-pandemic recovery, India highlighted the need to optimise the processes and procedures of the World Health Organization (WHO) for vaccine approval and emergency use authorisation, and this was endorsed by the G20 leaders.“This will strengthen WHO so that it can recognise vaccines faster,” one of the people cited above said.India’s call to work on a common framework for accepting vaccine certificates for the reopening of international travel was also included in the Rome Declaration.The declaration noted that post-pandemic recovery “remains highly divergent across and within countries, and exposed to downside risks, in particular the possible spread of new variants of Covid-19 and uneven vaccination paces”.G20 leaders also agreed on India’s push for declaring Covid-19 immunisation as a global public good.Modi’s suggestion of a global minimum 15% corporation tax rate, originally made at the 2014 G20 Summit, found acceptance from the grouping’s leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccines-to-data-at-g20-summit-india-made-push-on-issues-key-to-developing-countries-101635963720617.html

The Congress leader also wished the actor peace and strength,” the person added.Aryan was arrested following a raid on a cruise ship anchored at the International Cruise Terminal in Mumbai on October 2. The cruise was set to go to Goa when a team of Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) searched the guests and arrested Aryan along with his friend Arbaaz Merchant.The agency claimed that six grams of charas in a plastic pouch concealed in Merchant’s shoe was seized and the contraband material was purportedly meant for consumption by both of them.Both Aryan and Merchant were lodged in Mumbai’s Arthur Road central prison from October 3 till they were granted bail by the Bombay high court on October 28. While Aryan walked out of jail on October 30, Merchant was released a day later.HT has not seen a copy of the letter by the Congress leader to the actor.When HT reached out to Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala, he said that the letter, if any, was personal and could not be made public.Nationalist Congress Party leader Nawab Malik and Congress’ Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury had previously come out in support of the actor while raising questions over the conduct and nature of the NCP probe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/truth-cannot-be-held-hostage-for-long-rahul-gandhi-wrote-in-letter-to-shah-rukh-khan-101635963420931.html

Twenty-five samples tested positive for Zika virus on Wednesday, he added.The Uttar Pradesh health department on Monday sounded an alert across districts and intensified surveillance under its infectious disease control campaign to identify cases of infection, including Zika virus disease, in the early stages. To check the spread of the disease and track its source, health teams have been pressed to undertake sanitisation programmes, including anti-larvae spraying, identification of fever patients, screening of seriously ill people and pregnant women. Health officials have been asked to strengthen surveillance and ensure door-to-door sampling and testing, senior health officials said.“We advise locals not to panic regarding the sudden spurt in zika virus cases,” the DM said.On Monday, Dr Vedvrat Singh, Uttar Pradesh director general of medical health, said, “We are conducting the infectious disease control campaign in the state and all health staff have been briefed about the zika virus cases and asked to keep a watch in their respective areas. Although, no other district other than Kanpur has reported zika virus cases till now.”The first case of the zika virus in Kanpur was confirmed on October 23. An IAF warrant officer suffering from fever was admitted in the Air Force hospital where the doctors decided to go for further tests. His samples were sent to SGPGIMS (Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences) in Lucknow, where it was confirmed that he was infected with the zika virus. The Union health ministry then sent a high-level multidisciplinary team to Uttar Pradesh to monitor the situation.A high alert has been sounded in the periphery of hangars of the IAF station, said a senior health officer.Zika is a mosquito-borne virus that spreads through the bite of infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. According to the World Health Organisation, Aedes mosquitoes usually bite during the day, peaking during early morning and late afternoon or evening.In normal course, the symptoms of the zika virus disease are mild and include fever, conjunctivitis, muscle and joint pain and rashes.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/six-iaf-personnel-among-25-new-zika-cases-in-kanpur-tally-at-36-101635963361865.html
04-11-2021||India||Abhinandan Varthaman, who shot down F-16, promoted as group captain||Abhinandan Varthaman, who was awarded Vir Chakra for shooting down a Pakistani F-16 during a dogfight over the Line of Control (LoC) on February 27, 2019, picked up the rank of group captain on Wednesday morning, people familiar with the development said. A group captain is equivalent to a colonel in the army.The dogfight in which Abhinandan was involved took place a day after the Indian Air Force’s Mirage-2000s struck targets in Pakistan’s Balakot in response to the Pulwama suicide attack in Kashmir in which 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel were killed on February 14, 2019. Abhinandan was a wing commander then, equivalent to a lieutenant colonel in the army.Abhinandan, then 35, scripted military aviation history by downing an F-16, seconds before his own MiG-21 Bison was hit by a missile forcing him to eject. Experts then hailed it as the first ever kill of an F-16 by a MiG-21 Bison, fighter jets of two different generations. He was captured after he bailed out of his aircraft, but Pakistan returned him to India on March 1, 2019, after holding him captive for almost 60 hours.The fighter pilot is currently posted in the North-east, said one of the persons cited above.He was awarded Vir Chakra on Independence Day two years back. Vir Chakra is India’s third-highest wartime gallantry award, after Param Vir Chakra and Maha Vir Chakra.Abhinandan’s Vir Chakra citation, published in the Gazette of India in December 2019, said he courageously engaged the Pakistani aircraft package despite its “immense numerical and technological superiority,” and his aggressive manoeuvres forced the enemy aircraft into tactical chaos.In February 2019, Abhinandan was posted with a MiG-21 Bison squadron and was on ‘operational readiness platform’ duty at air force station Srinagar when a large Pakistan Air Force fighter aircraft package was detected heading towards LoC. The hostile jets were armed with advanced beyond visual range (BVR) air-to-air missiles and modern air-to-ground stand-off weapons.Abhinandan was scrambled to intercept this package five minutes after it was detected.“Displaying exceptional air combat acumen and knowledge of the enemy’s tactics, Abhinandan scanned the low altitude airspace with his airborne intercept (AI) radar and picked up an enemy aircraft that was flying low to ambush the Indian fighter interceptor aircraft… Abhinandan alerted the other formation pilots towards this surprise threat,” the citation said.“He then consolidated the riposte, by gathering his wingman in an offensive formation against the hostile Pakistani aircraft now dropping weapons on Indian Army positions. This audacious and aggressive manoeuvre forced the enemy aircraft into tactical chaos,” it further said.The citation said the wing commander pursued a retreating enemy fighter bomber aircraft and in the ensuing aerial combat, shot down an F-16. “However, in the melee, one of the enemy aircraft fired multiple advanced BVR missiles, one of which hit his aircraft forcing him to eject in enemy territory,” it said.On February 26, IAF’s Mirages hit three targets in Balakot with Israeli-origin Spice 2000 bombs with penetrator warheads that allowed the weapons to pierce through the rooftops before exploding inside to cause maximum damage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/abhinandan-varthaman-who-shot-down-f-16-promoted-as-group-captain-101635963187920.html
04-11-2021||India||Don’t have any more proof to share against Anil Deshmukh: Param Bir Singh||Former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh, on Wednesday, submitted an affidavit through his lawyer before the justice (retired) Kailas Uttamchand Chandiwal inquiry commission stating that he does not have any more evidence to share against former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh, whom he accused of corruption. The affidavit, filed last month by Singh’s power of attorney, reiterates the stand that he had taken earlier before the commission. Singh’s lawyer on Wednesday confirmed that the senior IPS officer submitted the affidavit in a previous hearing of the commission.Special public prosecutor, Shishir Hirey, appearing for the inquiry commission said, “Param Bir Singh has refused to give any more evidence in the matter, over and above what he had said in the letter written to the chief minister (Uddhav Thackeray) making serious corruption allegations against Deshmukh. He is also not ready for cross-examining any witness.” In March this year, the Maharashtra government formed the one-member commission of retired Justice Kailash Uttamchand Chandiwal to probe Singh’s allegations against Deshmukh. The former Mumbai police commissioner has been untraceable since past few months.Despite the commission issuing multiple summons and a bailable warrant against Singh, he has not appeared before the it so far.The commission had thrice imposed fines of ₹5,000 in June and ₹25,000 each on two other occasions on Singh for failing to appear before it.Last week, rhe courts in Mumbai and Thane have issued non-bailable warrants against Singh, who faces five FIRs. A look-out circular (LOC) has also been issued against him.Deshmukh resigned from the post of Maharashtra home minister in April this year after the corruption allegations. The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader has repeatedly denied the allegations against him.The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) are probing the allegations made against Deshmukh by Singh.Deshmukh was on Monday arrested by the ED in connection with a money laundering case linked to an alleged extortion racket in the state police. He was on Tuesday remanded in the ED’s custody till November 6||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-have-any-more-proof-to-share-against-anil-deshmukh-param-bir-singh-101635962820626.html
04-11-2021||India||Carbon emissions set to return to pre-Covid levels: Global Carbon Project report||Global carbon emissions in 2021 are set to rebound to pre-Covid levels, according to the projections of the Global Carbon Project report, which was released during the Glasgow Climate Change Conference (COP 26). The report also warned that the global CO2 (carbon dioxide) emissions are likely to rise steeply during the coming year, instead of declining immediately, and so efforts must be made to keep global warming to under 1.5 degree Celsius over the pre-industrial levels.Globally, CO2 emissions dropped by 5.4% in 2020 due to lockdowns induced by the Covid-19 pandemic, but the new report projected an increase of 4.9% this year (4.1% to 5.7%) to 36.4 billion tonnes in total. The report was prepared by a research team of University of Exeter, University of East Anglia (UEA), Center for International Climate Research (CICERO) and Stanford University.Researchers said a further rise in emissions in 2022 is also likely if road transport and aviation return to pre-pandemic levels and coal use is stable. “The rapid rebound in emissions as economies recover from the pandemic reinforces the need for immediate global action on climate change,” said Professor Pierre Friedlingstein, of Exeter’s Global Systems Institute, who led the study.Prof Corinne Le Quéré, Royal Society Research Professor at UEA’s School of Environmental Sciences, contributed to this year’s analysis. She said: “It will take some time to see the full effect of the Covid-related disruptions on global CO2 emissions. A lot of progress has been made in decarbonising global energy since the Paris Agreement was adopted in 2015, plus renewables is the only energy source that continued to grow during the pandemic. New investments and strong climate policy now need to support the green economy much more systematically and push fossil fuels out of the equation.”The report has projected that China’s emissions are likely to rise 4% compared to 2020, reaching 5.5% above 2019, and will represent 31% of global emissions. India’s emissions are projected to rise 12.6% compared to 2020, reaching 4.4% above 2019, representing 7% of global emissions. USA’ emissions are projected to rise 7.6% compared to 2020, reaching 3.7% below 2019, representing 14% of global emissions. EU27’s emissions are projected to rise 7.6% compared to 2020, reaching 4.2% below 2019 representing 7% of global emissions.The analysis doesn’t include international transport, particularly aviation. To have a 50% chance of limiting global warming to 1.5°C, 1.7°C and 2°C, the researchers estimate the remaining “carbon budget” has now shrunk to 420 billion tonnes, 770 billion tonnes and 1,270 billion tonnes, respectively — equivalent to 11, 20 and 32 years from the beginning of 2022.“Reaching net zero CO2 emissions by 2050 entails cutting global CO2 emissions by about 1.4 billion tonnes each year on average. Emissions fell by 1.9 billion tonnes in 2020 – so, to achieve net zero by 2050, we must cut emissions every year by an amount comparable to that seen during Covid. This highlights the scale of the action that is now required, and hence the importance of the COP26 discussions,” Friedlingstein said in a statement on Wednesday.IPCC’s report ‘The Physical Science Basis’ released in August suggests that to even attempt keeping global warming under 1.5 degree C, global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions will have to decline by about 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, reaching net zero by around 2050. United Nations’ updated nationally determined contribution (NDC) synthesis report, released on October 25, confirmed that for all available NDCs of 192 Parties taken together, there is likely to be a 16% increase in global GHG emissions in 2030 compared to 2010. Such an increase, unless changed quickly, is likely to lead to a temperature rise of about 2.7 degree Celsius by the end of the century.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/carbon-emissions-set-to-return-to-pre-covid-levels-global-carbon-project-report-101635962760556.html
04-11-2021||India||UP elections: Earlier funds spent on ‘kabristans’, now used for temples, says CM||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) uses public funds for welfare and temples whereas earlier administrations used it to construct boundary walls of “kabristans” (burial grounds), Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath said on Wednesday, attacking the Samajwadi Party without naming it. Adityanath was speaking at the fifth Deepotsav celebrations at the Ram Katha Park in Ayodhya, months before crucial assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh early next year. “Earlier, public funds were being utilised for constructing boundary walls of graveyards, but today, it is being spent on public welfare and temples,” he said. “You (public) have made this possible due to the power of democracy.”Adityanath condemned the firing on kar sevaks, or Hindu religious volunteers, in Ayodhya on October 30, 1990 and November 2, 1990 during the height of the Ram temple movement, and blamed the then SP government for it. “No one can forget what happened in Ayodhya 31 years ago. Karsevaks were lathicharged. But today, flowers are showered over them,” he said. “Whenever there is another kar seva in Ayodhya, their (SP) entire family will line-up (for kar seva),” the chief minister said in an apparent reference to the SP, The CM also assured the gathering that the Ram temple will come up in Ayodhya by December 2023. He inaugurated and laid foundation stones of projects worth ₹600 crore for Ayodhya. The chief minister announced extension of the free ration scheme for poor till the festive occasion of Holi in 2023. This scheme was to end in December. He issued an appeal to people to follow Covid norms and get vaccinated as the pandemic was not over. This is the fifth consecutive Deepotsav celebrations in Ayodhya. After coming to power in Uttar Pradesh in March 2017, the BJP government started celebrating Deepotsav in Ayodhya on Diwali eve every year.In 2017, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had courted controversy after he compared the number of cremation grounds with graveyards in the state. “If you create kabristaan (graveyard) in a village, then a shamshaan (cremation ground) should be created. If electricity is given uninterrupted in Ramzan, then it should also be given during Diwali without a break. Bhedbhaav nahin hona chahiye (there should be no discrimination,” Modi told a rally in Fatehpur district during the state assembly elections in 2017. The remarks were criticised by several political party leaders, with the Congress saying that the Prime Minister was talking “senseless things”, sensing his party’s “imminent” defeat in the polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-elections-earlier-funds-spent-on-kabristans-now-used-for-temples-says-yogi-adityanath-101635962640781.html
04-11-2021||India||COP26: HAC asks all parties to deliver on net zero emissions target||The High Ambition Coalition (HAC), which includes the US, Germany, France and several others, in a statement issued at the Glasgow climate change conference (COP 26) on Tuesday, called on all 196 parties to deliver on mid-century net zero greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) goals with strategies for their implementation that align with a 1.5 degree C trajectory as soon as possible, and in time for consideration by leaders at the global stocktake in 2023.The HAC has also called on parties to commit to a collective goal of reducing global methane emissions by at least 30% from 2020 levels by 2030, and to take aggressive action to reduce emissions of all super-pollutants, including hydrofluorocarbons and black carbon. HAC’s intervention could pose a challenge to emerging economies like India and others who have been calling for equity and common-but-differentiated responsibilities (a principle within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) that acknowledges different capabilities and differing responsibilities of individual countries) in mitigating climate crisis.The Republic of the Marshall Islands formed the HAC in run-up negotiations to the Paris Agreement in 2015. The HAC helped secure key elements of the Paris deal, including the 1.5 degree C temperature goal, the net zero global emissions pathway by the second half of the century, and a five-year cycle for updating mitigation contributions, according to their website.The HAC also stressed the need to halve global emissions by 2030 and called on all Parties to deliver more ambitious NDCs in line with a 1.5 degree C trajectory as soon as possible and well ahead of COP27. Several climate vulnerable island nations, such as Palau, Marshall Islands, Fiji, Antigua and Barbuda, are also part of the coalition. US President Joe Biden, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron have signed off the statement.“This could be a problem going ahead. It has the US in it which is powerful. There is no mention of equity. It’s aligned to an ambitious target of 1.5 degree C with no mention of common but differentiated responsibilities. It can pose a challenge, especially to emerging economies,” said a senior climate negotiations expert on condition of anonymity.HAC has also called on all developed countries to deliver on the goal of mobilising $100 billion annually till 2025 in the “context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation.” Some developing countries may have reservations on this also as to which actions will be considered meaningful. The coalition suggested that the adaptation finance gap be addressed by scaling up adaptation finance to at least double the current levels.“Reiterate our commitment to make finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development, and commit to initiating deliberations for a post-2025 finance goal based on the best available science, an assessment of the needs and priorities of developing countries, and lessons from the $100 billion goal,” the HAC statement said.“Why should we align to a common timeframe of achieving net zero emissions by mid-century? We have always said if that time frame needs to be aligned with, then historical emitters should transition at least by 2030. They can say all this in their statement but CBDR will have to be respected,” said a member of the Indian delegation in Glasgow.Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on November 1 that India will reach carbon neutrality by 2070. He also announced a five-point action plan that includes: India will increase its non-fossil fuel power capacity to 500 gigawatts (GW) by the end of the decade, up from 450GW; half of India’s electricity (installed capacity) will come from renewable sources by 2030; India’s 2030 carbon intensity goal — measured as carbon dioxide emissions per unit of gross domestic product — will be increased from 35% to 45%; and the country will also strive to produce half of its electricity using renewable energy and cut carbon-dioxide emissions by 1 billion tonnes from business as usual by 2030.Another expert said, “If you go by this statement, then there will be pressure over China also as they have announced net zero transition by 2060 and their NDC is weak. But China has already emitted a lot and is now the largest emitter in the world.”According to a recent analysis by the Centre for Science and Environment, in the coming ten years, China will take up 33% of the remaining carbon budget of 409 GtCO2 and India may occupy only 9.54% of the budget. Between 1870 and 2019, China occupied 13.4% of the global carbon budget; India 3.16% and the seven historical polluters— United Kingdom, United States, European Union-27, Russia, Japan, Australia, and Canada occupied 60.53% of the carbon budget. The share changed quite a bit between 1990 and 2019, when China occupied nearly 21% of the carbon budget. This means China went through a very intense phase of development mainly dependent on fossil fuels during those 20 odd years.The issue of net zero emission is anyway inequitable. If it were to be equitable, developed (OECD) countries should have a target of net zero by 2030, China by 2040 and India and the rest of the world by 2050, the Centre for Science and Environment highlighted in a statement on Tuesday.HT reported on Wednesday that several developing countries have backed India’s demands at the COP26 climate summit for a new finance goal to support the energy transition.Apurba Mitra, Head, Climate-policy, World Resources Institute India, said: “The high ambition coalition is a subset of the parties to the UNFCCC and this will be one of the proposals discussed and negotiated over the next two weeks resulting in a final decision or declaration in Glasgow. Some of the elements of this proposal may find uptake, but may not be all. We will just have to wait and see how the element of differentiation and equity will be introduced in the final declaration, which is currently missing in this text.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cop26hac-asks-all-parties-to-deliver-on-net-zero-emissions-target-101635962520656.html
04-11-2021||India||PM Modi unveils door-to-door drive to cover those yet to get the jab||Prime minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday launched the month-long Har Ghar Dastak (knock on every door) campaign aimed to conduct a special house-to-house Covid-19 vaccination drive, with special focus on those whose second dose is overdue, to accelerate complete vaccination. Modi launched the drive during a review of 45 districts, across 11 states and a union territory that have low coverage of the first dose. The chief ministers of these states and the district administrators were present during the review.The special vaccination drive will be held between November 3 and 30.“So far you have had been making efforts to safely administer Covid vaccine doses at vaccination centres. Now the time has come to focus your efforts on house-visits to ensure you cover those who have not been vaccinated as yet,” Modi said. The 11 states whose chief ministers attended the meeting are: Arunchal Pradesh (6 districts with low coverage of first shots), Assam (1), Chhattisgarh (1), Haryana (1), Jharkhand (8), Maharashtra (5), Manipur (8), Meghalaya (4), Mizoram (1), Nagaland (8), Tamil Nadu (1) and Delhi (1).Till 7 PM on Wednesday night, India had administered 1,076.3 million doses of the vaccine. Of the eligible (18 years and above) population of 940 million, 337.27 million had received both doses and 739.04 million, one dose, translating into a 78.6% coverage in terms of those who have received at least one dose of the vaccineAccording to the Co-WIN dashboard, the coverage of first doses across Indian states ranges from 61% to over 100% (on the basis of population projections made by the National Commission on Population). The top five states and UTs are: Himachal Pradesh (103.6% coverage), Jammu and Kashmir (101.2%), Kerala (94.9%), Uttarakhand (92.9%), and Gujarat (91.7. And the bottom five are Jharkhand (60.8%), North-eastern states excluding Assam (66.7%), Uttar Pradesh (67.1%), Bihar (68.3%), and Punjab (70.3%). By districts, the bottom five districts (in terms of first dose coverage) as of November 2 are: Senapati in Manipur (25.1%), Kiphire in Nagaland (25.6%), Ukhrul in Manipur (27.8%), Kurung Kume in Arunachal Pradesh (28.9%), and Narayanpur in Chhattisgarh (30.5%). Since there are no official population projections at the district-level, these coverage figures use the number of electors in the district (2011 census districts taken here) before the 2019 Lok Sabha election as a proxy for adult population.Experts say while vaccination pace has picked up, going door-to-door will be idea to take care of last mile coverage. “Those who had to come to get vaccinated on their own have largely come, and now for the ones left governments will have to make an effort to reach out to them. Even though there is no data to support how much is good enough, I would say covering as high as possible will be good,” said Dr Giridhara Babu, head, epidemiology, Indian Institute of Public Health. “During this house-to-house campaign, along with those who are yet to receive their first dose, you all must also focus on administering the second dose. When disease transmission comes down, the feeling of urgency also tends to come down. People start thinking what is the hurry; we will get jabbed later,” the PM added.According to the government data, as on October 27, at least 103.4 million second doses were overdue, a cause for concern because only both doses provide adequate protection against symptomatic infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19, hospitalisation, even death. . HT first reported this on October 23, when India administered its billionth vaccine. At that time, around 90 million second shots were overdue. Modi said there should be no laxity in the pace of Covid vaccination even though we have administered one billion doses, and asked the officials to ensure that the country must widen its vaccination coverage by the end of the year and enter the new year with renewed self-belief and confidence.During his meeting with PM Modi on Wednesday, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray apprised him about Mission Kavach Kundal, a drive undertaken to step up rate of vaccination in the state. “Vaccination tends to prevent infection and also blunts the effects of the virus. Citizens should take both doses,” said Thackeray. Chhahttisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel in his letter to PM Modi on Wednesday said, “During the conference it was pointed out that 38,82,646 second doses are due in Chhattisgarh against which we only have 31,93,735 doses for the second round. While we have no vaccines for the first dose.In addition to this we are also facing syringe shortage. As against the 31,93,735 doses of vaccines we have only 19,76, 722 syringes which is hampering the vaccination drive in the state.”The PM also told the states that the pandemic resulted in people finding innovative solutions to problems, and similarly there was a need to find innovative solutions to complete remaining vaccinations in the remotest regions. The interventions suggested by the PM to encourage people to take the vaccine include: taking the support of religious leaders; jingles in local languages; posters and pamphlets etc. The Prime minister discussed the issue of vaccine hesitancy and the local factors behind it in detail.“Develop micro strategies, keeping in mind the experience so far to go for saturation of vaccination by addressing the gaps at local level… You will have to do your best to take your districts nearer the national average…,” he told the administrators. “Last mile is always the most challenging and it has been seen that the states are capable of vaccinating in large numbers, and supplies are also not an issue anymore. What is now required is micro planning as even during the Universal Immunisation programme governments held social mobilization and outreach camps at areas where coverage seems low,” added Babu. Modi also suggested creating teams of 20-25 people depending on the region, and have healthy competition between them in terms of number of vaccinations. “We have granular data available with us till the district level through CoWIN platform; our district officials can do line-listing which means cross check names with numbers and also get addresses of target beneficiaries. Health care workers on ground such as ASHA workers can be made use of for conducting door-to-door visits,” said a senior health ministry official aware of the matter, on condition of anonymity. The districts that have covered less than 50% of the adult population with at least one shot of the vaccine, and those districts that have low coverage of the second dose were part of the review.The Prime Minister emphasised that under the free vaccine-for-all campaign, India created a record of administering about 25 million vaccine doses in a day, a feat that bears testimony to India’s capabilities.On September 17, to commemorate Modi’s birthday, states across India administered 26.7 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines. In October, an average of 5.58 million vaccine doses were administered every day. According to the Prime Minister’s Office, there are currently 45 districts in India that are still seeing a heavy lag in vaccination coverage as they are yet to administer even a single shot to more than half their adult population at a time when the national average for such coverage is at least 78%.While 38% of the population is fully vaccinated, there are still at least 103 million beneficiaries whose second dose is overdue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-unveils-door-to-door-drive-to-cover-those-yet-to-get-the-jab-101635962223572.html
04-11-2021||India||Akhilesh to ally with uncle Shivpal Yadav, says will give him ‘full respect’||Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav on Wednesday announced an alliance with his estranged uncle Shivpal Yadav’s party for the upcoming assembly elections, attempting to bring the curtain down on a family feud that erupted five years ago over control of the party. Akhilesh told reporters that the party will work together to bring Shivpal into the alliance on SP founder Mulayam Singh Yadav’s birthday on November 22. Shivpal, SP MLA from Jaswantnagar (Etawah), is Mulayam’s younger brother. “It has been the endeavour of the Samajwadi Party to stitch an alliance with smaller parties. Naturally, we are going to forge an alliance with Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party-Lohia (PSP-L), the party of uncle Shivpal Singh Yadav as well. The SP will give him full respect,” Ahilesh told reporters. “Many small parties have joined hands with us. Recently, Om Prakash Rajbhar (president of Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party) held a historic programme in Mau and allied with the SP,” he added.When asked whether the PSP-L will merge with the SP, Akhilesh said: “Alliance, not merger.” This is the first indication of a rapprochement in the first family of the SP since Shivpal left it in 2018.Shivpal served as public works department and irrigation minister in Akhilesh’s government before the two fellout in August 2016 over control of the SP. After Akhilesh took over the reins of the party from Mulayam Singh Yadav in 2017, Shivpal broke away from the SP and floated his own party in 2018.In the 2017 assembly polls, the SP suffered big losses, slipping to 47 from 224 seats in 2012. The family feud was considered to be one of the causes of the party’s bad showing at the hustings.Shivpal always projected himself as the lieutenant of Mulayam Singh Yadav, claiming he had worked very hard with the SP founder in building the party since its inception in 1992. He was always known for his organisational skills in the party. He also had a powerful role in the party and was often referred to as the de facto chief minister, till Akhilesh became the chief minister in 2012. However in 2016, an internal conflict emerged between Shivpal and his nephew and intensified to a point where Mulayam Singh Yadav replaced Akhilesh and appointed Shivpal as the state unit chief. Akhilesh retaliated by dismissing Shivpal from the state cabinet. A couple of months later, Mulayam (as national president of SP) expelled Akhilesh and SP national general secretary Ramgopal Yadav from the party for six years only to revoke the decision a couple of days later. Eventually on January 2017, at an emergency national convention of the party, Akhilesh was elected the national president of the party and Mulayam was named the chief patron. Shivpal contested the 2019 Lok Sabha elections against SP candidate and then sitting MP Akshay Yadav from Firozabad. However, both parties lost the seat to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Since 2018, Shivpal had been trying to stitch an alliance with the Opposition but Akhilesh remained non-committal on the matter. “We had been saying that like-minded socialists should come together. Whenever socialists have come together, they have won the elections,” PSP-L leader Deepak Mishra said.HT tried to reach out to Shivpal for a comment but could not get one immediately. “We had been saying that like-minded socialists should come together. Whenever socialists have come together, they won elections,” Deepak Mishra, a PSP-L leader, said.“A family uniting is good news. We want families to remain united. But, with SP lawmakers and leaders eyeing to enter BJP, the big question is if the SP would remain united under its Jinnah-loving party head,” BJP spokesperson Harish Srivastava said.Political analyst and former head of Political Science department of Lucknow University, Prof SK Dwivedi, said: “I had always said that it is important for the SP to ally with Shivpal. Ending the acrimony would not only send a good signal to voters but also help SP. Shivpal many have not won any seats in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, but if he contests the 2022 polls without SP, then even if he fares badly, it would harm the SP as the vote banks of both SP and PSP-L are common. I always said that now that Akhilesh is the national president of the party, he should be generous to Shivpal.” Meanwhile, Akhilesh hit out at chief minister Yogi Adityanath over his remarks that the former should issue an apology for comparing Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel with Pakistan’s founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah.“The BJP engages in the politics of hatred. It is always on the lookout for such chances. They do not talk about unemployment and development,” Akhilesh said. At a public meeting in Hardoi on Sunday, Akhilesh had said that “Sardar Patel, Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, and Mohammed Ali Jinnah studied in the same institute and became barristers. They helped [India] get freedom and never backed away from any struggle.”The speech came on the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhai Patel, independent India’s first home minister and the man who united the country by convincing the princely states to merge with the Union of India. Unlike the other three who studied law at the Inner Temple, Patel studied at the Middle Temple. In response, Adityanath said the comment smacked of “Talibani mentality, which the people of the country and Uttar Pradesh will not tolerate”.On the chief minister’s proposed visit to Etawah on November 6, Akhilesh said: “Maybe he (Yogi Adityanath) is visiting Etawah to inaugurate some of the works that our government has done. He does not have any work of his to showcase. When he comes here, ask him what significant work he did.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-elections-akhilesh-yadav-to-ally-with-uncle-shivpal-yadav-says-will-give-him-full-respect-101635962100807.html
04-11-2021||India||Happy Diwali, but do not lower your guard against Covid-19||Covid-19 cases in India have been falling, more than a billion doses of vaccines have been administered, most studies show the high prevalence of Covid antibodies among people, and high-frequency indices on the economy and mobility are looking up. On all these counts, this Diwali is a lot better than last year. Yet, two years of experience with the pandemic – researchers estimate November 17, 2019 to be a likely date when the first Covid-19 case was detected in China – and 248 million cases and 5 million (accounted) deaths across the world tell us that it will be dangerous to lower the guard against the viral disease.Global cases rising since late OctoberThe seven-day average of daily new cases of Covid-19 in the world has been increasing since October 17. This number was 402,130 on October 17; it was 423,606 on November 2. To be sure, these numbers are significantly lower than the previous peaks of daily new cases in the world. But the increase is still a matter of concern. Russia is seeing a surge. China is seeing a resurgence and is threatening localised lockdowns through the coming winter months. Regions that are experiencing a surge and are reporting at least a thousand cases (apart from the US, where the 7-day average is still a high 74,330) include countries in Europe, South Korea and Vietnam.Even better vaccinated Europe is witnessing a surgeThe biggest change between now and a year ago, as far as the global fight against the pandemic is concerned, has been the availability of vaccines. There is a massive inequality among countries when it comes to vaccination coverage. However, what is really concerning about the recent spike in Covid-19 cases is the fact that even countries with higher vaccination coverage are experiencing a rise in number of Covid-19 cases. For example, the share of population which has been fully vaccinated in Hungary and Germany is 60% and 66%, yet, these countries are at the top of the list in terms of growth in number of daily new cases.India accounts for only 3% of global cases right nowThe seven-day average of India’s contribution to new Covid-19 cases was just 3.12% on November 2. This number has been declining with brief interruptions for 176 days now and is far lower than both peaks of India’s contribution to global cases. In the week ending 11 September 2020, India contributed 34% to global cases (the first peak of India’s share in global cases). In the week ending May 10 this year – the second peak of India’s contribution – the country’s share was 50.5%.Past Covid-19 surges associated with public events and festivalsWhile India’s Covid-19 trajectory is on the decline right now, a disruption in this will not be surprising in the festival season. India’s first wave – in terms of 7-day average of cases – peaked on 16 September 2020. This number kept falling until October 31. However, from November 1 (five days after Dussehra) to November 8, the growth rate of cases was positive on six days. From November 19 (five days after Diwali) to November 24, the growth rate was again positive. Cases continued to decline after that until another cocktail of mass gatherings – the Kumbh Mela starting January (despite being officially restricted to April), Holi and the election campaign in four states (the polls were announced on February 26) led to a surge in cases. To be sure, this is also when the Delta variant struck in India. For close to three months -- from February 15 to May 6 -- the growth rate of seven-day average of cases remained positive every day, leading to a second wave peak on May 9 (seven-day average of 391,819 cases) that was four times as big as the first wave peak (average of 93,617 cases).A middling share of fully vaccinated people means India needs to remain cautiousWhile India has done a credible job in administering at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine to almost 80% of its adult population, only 36% of adults has been fully vaccinated. European countries with higher shares of fully vaccinated population are experiencing a surge in cases. The festive season has seen some much-needed momentum in economic activity and mobility levels and sustained efforts are being taken towards normalizing other important activities such as resumption of physical classes in schools and colleges. It will be a travesty if a reversal in the caseload trajectory on account of carelessness were to disrupt the much-awaited normalization of the economy, education and life in general.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/happy-diwali-but-do-not-lower-your-guard-against-covid19-101635954960128.html
04-11-2021||India||Rajasthan judge arrested for ‘sexual assault on boy’: Police||A judge, who was suspended after being booked for allegedly sexually exploiting a 14-year-old boy in Rajasthan’s Bharatpur, was arrested on Wednesday, police said, adding that he was questioned for two days in Jaipur before his arrest. Bharatpur superintendent of police Devendra Kumar Bishnoi said the judge, identified as Jitendra Singh, has been booked for sodomy under Section 377 (unnatural offences) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act. The SP added that two other accused, identified as Anshul Soni, the judge’s steno, and Rahul Katara, another staff of the judge, were absconding. The 52-year-old judge, who presided over a special anti-corruption court in Bharatpur, was arrested after the boy’s mother lodged a complaint against him on Sunday. The judge, however, accused the boy and his family of blackmailing him for money. The Rajasthan high court, on October 31, suspended the judge and constituted a team to probe into the matter. According to the police, the minor boy’s mother has alleged that they were being threatened and pressured to withdraw the case. In her complaint, she said the judge met her son at a tennis court and befriended him last month. She has alleged that the special judge and the two other accused had been sexually assaulting her son by intoxicating him with some narcotic substance for the past one month.She has also claimed that the judge threatened to implicate her and her brother in false cases if they reported the matter, police said. The family first suspected something was amiss when the boy started to avoid them. He finally narrated his ordeal on October 28, the mother said. She added that when her son did not go to the tennis court the next day, the judge sent his associate, a police officer and a few others to their residence. “On refusing to send the boy, the judge called us (on phone) later at night, on October 29. When I told him we were aware of what happened, he hung up,” she said. “The next day, the judge, along with one other person, came to our residence, accepted what he had done, and apologised. That same evening, a senior police officer came and threatened us with dire consequences,” the woman said in her complaint.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/judge-arrested-for-sodomising-boy-in-rajasthan-101635939538383.html
04-11-2021||India||Tripura violence: Delhi lawyer booked under UAPA for promoting enmity||Agartala Tripura Police on Wednesday booked an advocate under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) for allegedly sharing fake information, on social media, on the recent violence in Panisagar, where a mosque, few houses and shops were reportedly vandalised by activists of Vishwa Hindu Parishad. The state police registered the case against Mukesh, a Delhi-based advocate for the People’s Union For Civil Liberties (PUCL), for allegedly “promoting enmity among two religious groups as well as provoking the people of different religious communities to cause breach of police”. The case was filed under Section 13 of UAPA, besides various sections of the Indian Penal Code. Asking the advocate to appear for questioning by November 10, police, in its notice, said: “During the investigation, your involvement has been found in connection with the case. As such, there are reasonable grounds to ascertain the facts and circumstances relating to the case.” The police also directed the lawyer to remove the alleged posts on social media. The police move came hours after it booked 71 people and filed five criminal cases over alleged fake and provocative posts on social media aimed at disturbing peace and communal harmony in the state.A mosque, a few houses and shops were reportedly vandalised by activists of Vishwa Hindu Parishad during their rally on October 26. While four people were arrested in this regard, police later said that no mosque was burnt and photographs showing the same were not from Tripura. “Strict action shall be taken against those persons who are trying to create hatred in the society,” the state police said in a tweet. A senior police officer requesting anonymity said that the five cases were filed for allegedly spreading rumours on social media platforms on the issue of recent communal violence incidents in Tripura. “Preliminary investigations revealed that fake pictures and videos were uploaded on social media to tarnish the image of the government and the state police,” the officer added. The police appealed to people “not to like or retweet provocative posts since it amounts to rumour-mongering”. Fake news is being circulated that a mosque in Kakraban area of Gomati district has been damaged and vandalised, the police tweeted. “This is a complete misrepresentation of facts. The mosque in Dargabazar area of Kakraban is completely fine & Gomati police is working to maintain peace and tranquility,” they added. The cybercrime department of the state police, while replying to a tweet, said, “These are fake videos being circulated under criminal conspiracy to disturb the peace and communal harmony in the state and defame the state government and police. Police has registered criminal cases and suitable action against the fake rumours is being taken expeditiously.” Meanwhile, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) sought an action taken report from the Tripura government on the October 26 violence. The human rights panel also sought the report, within four weeks, from Tripura chief secretary, DGP Tripura police and secretary of Tripura state human rights commission on the alleged rise in political violence in the state on the basis of a complaint filed by Trinamool Congress national spokesperson Saket Gokhale.In his complaint, Gokhale alleged that leaders and workers belonging to the TMC were attacked, during poll campaigns, by those belonging to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the state. In one such incident, one sitting Parliamentarian and TMC workers were injured and their vehicles vandalised, the complainant added. Gokhale further referred to the October 26 violence in Panisagar, where a mosque and two shops were reportedly set on fire during a rally organised by Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP). “... post such incidents, there is an atmosphere of immense fear among the members of that community in the area with regard to their life and safety. The complainant is seeking intervention of the Commission in the matter,” the letter said.Taking note of the TMC spokesperson’s complaint, the NHRC, in its order, said: “The Commission has considered the complaint and directed its Registry to transmit the copy of the complaint to the Chief Secretary, Govt. of Tripura and the Director-General of Police, Tripura to submit an action taken report within a period of four weeks.”“The concerned authorities shall also intimate the Commission, if any notice, order etc., has been received by him/them in the instant matter from the State Human Rights Commission? If yes, a copy of such order is also sent to the Commission within four weeks. Let a copy of the complaint be also transmitted to the Secretary of the concerned State Human Rights Commission, calling upon him to inform this Commission the date of cognizance, if any, taken at their end in the instant matter within four weeks,” it added. Last week, the Tripura high court had taken cognisance of the violence and sought a detailed report from the state government by November 10. The report, however, is yet to be submitted, according to people aware of the developments. The state government on October 29 said that a group with vested interest from outside had hatched a conspiracy against the administration to create unrest in Tripura and malign its image by uploading fake photographs of a burning mosque on social media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/71-booked-for-provocative-social-media-posts-over-communal-violence-in-tripura-101635933597857.html
04-11-2021||India||Lakhimpur Kheri: Hearing on bail pleas of Ashish Mishra deferred till Nov 15||Lucknow/Lakhimpur Kheri: A district and sessions court on Wednesday deferred till November 15 the hearing on the bail applications of Union minister of state for home Ajay Kumar Mishra Teni’s son Ashish and two other accused, Ashish Pandey and Lavkush Rana, in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence case, senior prosecution officials said. District government counsel (DGC) Arvind Tripathi said the prosecution urged the court of district and sessions judge Mukesh Mishra for some more days as some forensic reports are still awaited. The judge deferred the hearing till November 15. Violence had erupted at Tikunia in Lakhimpur Kheri district on October 3 when four farmers were allegedly mowed down by a speeding vehicle during a protest. A local journalist, a driver and two Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers were also killed in the subsequent violence. Two FIRs were registered in this connection: one in connection with the death of the four farmers while the second FIR was lodged in connection with the violence during which four others, including two BJP workers, a journalist and the driver of the car, which allegedly mowed down the farmers, were killed. Ashish Mishra, Ashish Pandey and Lavkush Rana are among the 13 accused, identified and arrested during investigation of the first FIR. The other accused include Sumit Jaiswal, Ankit Das, Shekhar Bharti, Latif alias Kale, Mohit Trivedi, Rinku Rana, Dharmendra, Nandan Singh Bisht, Shishu Pal, Satya Prakash Tripathi alias Satyam.

Tripathi said defence counsel Awadhesh Dubey moved an application in the court enclosing a purported photograph and urged the court for an explanation from the prosecution as to how a BJP worker, Shyam Sundar Nishad, who was seen in the photo in police custody, died. The prosecution objected to the photo, which was yet to be verified, Tripathi added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lakhimpur-kheri-violence-hearing-on-bail-pleas-of-accused-deferred-until-nov-15-101635929577250.html
04-11-2021||India||Diya sales up, pottery industry gets new lease of life in UP||The smiles are broader at the houses of potters this Diwali and the lights seem to shine brighter. Driven by burgeoning government demand and mega events like the Deepotsav in Ayodhya, the sale of earthen diyas or lamps is expected to cross 10 million, a record. The numbers represent a remarkable turnaround for the small-scale industry that was nearly driven out of the market by lights manufactured in China a few years ago. Compared to 2019, sales of diyas are up 50%, say industry associations. “In 2020, around 200,000 to 250,000 diyas were sold in Ayodhya and its adjoining regions. This year, the sale has gone up to somewhere between 450,000 to 500,000 diyas,” said Jagat Prajapati, a local potter. For the Deepotsav celebrations at Ram Ki Paidi in Ayodhya where about 9 lakh lamps will be lit, diyas are largely sourced locally through a tender by the Ayodhya administration. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) also plans to light 4.5 million diyas to reflect the number of beneficiaries of the Awaas Yojana, the government’s housing scheme. The administration also plans to buy another 3 million diyas to light the houses of party workers. The government’s push has also boosted demand from ordinary citizens, who have ditched electronic lights for diyas to spruce up their home decoration on Diwali. Potters at Nandpur, a hamlet with roughly 60 artisans near Lucknow,, say they haven’t witnessed such demand in decades. “The Covid crisis badly affected all trades and pottery was no exception. In contrast to what was anticipated, the pottery business is doing well as the demand for earthenware, especially designer and wax diyas, is quite high this Diwali,” said Jafar Ali, a potter . Another potter Afsar Alam, 33, said unlike previous years, when there used to be marginal or even no profit on Diwali, this time Nandpur has been witnessing long queues of retailers since Karva Chauth, which was celebrated on October 3.“A majority of bulk buyers placed the orders for designer diyas,” said Alam, a traditional potter from Nandpur village. “In contrast to previous years, the sale of diyas has gone up. We used to sell 800 to 2,000 earthen lamps a day (including regular and designer ones), this year we have recorded the sale of around 3,000 to 4,500 diyas in a day.”Around 135 km from the state capital, around 40 families of potters in Ayodhya’s Jaisinghpur are racing against time to meet orders. “This Diwali, the sale of diyas has picked up as compared to last year when festivities were hit by the pandemic,” said Jagat Prajapati, a resident of Jaisinghpur. At the core of this demand surge is the Deepotsav in Ayodhya. The state government also organises Deepotsav in around 217 places including 200 Nagar Palikas. “There is no doubt that the almost dying traditional pottery industry has got a new lease of life due to Deepotsav celebrations in Ayodhya,” Naresh Kumar, a potter said. The Mati Kala Board set up by the state government in July 2018, the 2020“vocal for local” campaign and the department of micro, small and medium enterprises helped popularise diyas, said a state government official. Additional chief secretary for home and religious endowment departments, Awanish Awasthi, said, “UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath first asked us to light 51,000 earthen lamps in 2017. This number has gone up to the lighting of nine lakh plus earthen lamps in 2021. The Deepotsav has given a push to Ayodhya’s economy with the number of pilgrims visiting the temple town going up manifold.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/big-demand-for-diyas-brings-potters-back-into-business-this-diwali-101635928977191.html
04-11-2021||India||Himachal Pradesh: Jairam Thakur’s role under lens after BJP’s bypoll loss||New Delhi: The Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) defeat in three assembly and one Lok Sabha seat in bypolls in Himachal Pradesh has cast a shadow on the leadership of chief minister Jairam Thakur, people familiar with the matter in the ruling party said.Though Thakur attributed issues such as inflation for the disappointing outcome for the BJP on Tuesday, leaders in the party indicated that his inability to mitigate public anger over a host of issues, including the government’s Covid -19 response, price rise and a spate of natural disasters that hurt the economy and ecology of the state, contributed to the loss.“The BJP will introspect the causes for the defeat, will formulate a strategy to overcome its shortcomings and do everything possible to ensure victory in the 2022 assembly elections,” Thakur said. He also hinted at friction within the state unit as one of the reasons behind the loss.In a body blow to the BJP and Thakur in particular, the party could not even retain the Lok Sabha seat in Mandi ,which is his home turf. Congress member Pratibha Singh, wife of former chief minister, late Virbhadra Singh, won the constituency.The defeat raised questions if the BJP can afford to go to the 2022 assembly polls with Thakur as the party’s CM face as it revisit its election strategy in the hill state.A BJP leader in Delhi said that price rise was a pan India concern and there was a perception within the party that Thakur could not gauge public anger and come up with interventions. The margin of losses was another cause of concern for the BJP, which only mustered 28% votes as against the Congress’s 48% . Thakur will have to iron out differences within the state unit apart from overseeing candidate selection. The decision to not give tickets to tje kin of BJP leaders was also cited as a reason for the loss in Jubbal-Kotkhai assembly constituency.Though there is no telling if the central leadership will opt for a change of CM, it would not be a surprise given the recent changes in leadership in election bound states such as Uttarakhand and Gujarat. The party replaced Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani with Bhupendra Patel in September and switched Tirath Singh Rawat with Pushkar Singh Dhami in Uttarakhand in July. Both states are slated to go to the polls in 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjps-by-poll-defeat-in-himachal-casts-shadow-on-jairam-thakur-101635919615977.html
