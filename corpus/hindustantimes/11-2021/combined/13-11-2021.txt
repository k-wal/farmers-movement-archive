He was diagnosed with dengue but had comorbidities. He was suffering from diabetes and also had chest issues,” said Rajesh Sharma, district malaria officer. According to official data, the district reported eight new cases of dengue in the last 24 hours ending on Saturday evening, taking the tally of cases to 566, of which 27 are active cases. As per health department’s protocol, any dengue case reported at private or government hospitals across the district are first to be confirmed at the sentinel lab. The District Hospital in Sector 30 has been declared as the district-level sentinel lab by the state health department, informed Sharma.“All the samples that are confirmed positive for dengue by private hospitals and health centres are first verified at the sentinel lab and only then included in the official tally and the same goes for reported fatalities. The district health department has been instructed to verify only those samples which have been declared positive by the ELISA (enzyme-linked immunoassay) test. The positive cases being reported from the district hospital, Super Specialty Paediatric Hospital and Post Graduate Teaching Institute, and the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida are already being tested on ELISA and are directly included in the official tally,” said Sharma.Medical experts say that this year, not only has the number of dengue cases increased in the district compared to previous years but the number of serious cases has also increased. “This time, more dengue patients are suffering from high-grade fever. There are also more patients of dengue haemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome compared to previous years. The condition of such patient becomes critical as their platelet count deteriorates rapidly and the infection also starts diminishing red blood cells,” said Dr Yatendra Singh, medical superintendent of Bhangel community health centre (CHC), Gautam Budh NagarCurrently, dengue testing is being done at the district hospital, the paediatric hospital and GIMS, Greater Noida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gautam-budh-nagar-records-second-dengue-death-case-tally-reaches-566-101636828194174.html
13-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi pollution: Nasa records 57,000 farm fires from November 1 to 13||New Delhi: Between November 1 and November 13 this year, Punjab and Haryana have recorded the most number of stubble fires since 2012, satellite data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) shows. According to the data accessed by HT from SUOMI VIIRS C2, FIRMS-NASA resource, between November 1 and November 13, the cumulative fire count reported from the two states was 57,263, exceeding 52,719 incidents recorded in 2016. Data also showed that during the entire stubble burning season, which begins from October 1, these two agrarian states have together recorded 75,225 fire incidents that is just 440 short of the incidents recorded in 2020. Maximum fire counts in the two states were reported in 2016, when 94,173 such incidents were seen. This was also the year when Delhi recorded one of its worst pollution spells. “Our analysis shows that if you look at the total fire count recorded in Punjab this year, it is still slightly short of the 2020 numbers. But in Haryana, this year 7,963 fires have been reported, which is higher than the count it recorded in 2020, 2019 and 2018,” said Pawan Gupta, senior scientist, earth sciences (USRA), NASA Marshall Space Flight Centre. According to the Punjab government data, the state recorded 3,742 farm fires on Saturday, taking the total number of incidents in the state this season to 62,863, the second highest over the past five years. Almost 80% of total cases this season have been recorded in November. Last year, Punjab recorded 76,590 incidents and 55,210 cases in 2019.According to the union ministry of earth science’s System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (Safar), the contribution of farm fires to Delhi’s PM 2.5 (particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) was above 30%. The forecast suggested that with transport wind speeds slowing down, the share of stubble smoke in Delhi is likely to reduce in the coming days. “Winds at the transport level (925mb) are slowing down resulting in a lesser intrusion of farm fire-related pollutants into Delhi. However, local winds are becoming calm and temperatures are decreasing further, preventing efficient dispersion of pollutants. The fire count was 3157 and the contribution was 31%,” Safar said.

13-11-2021||Lucknow||Lucknow man held for raping, blackmailing his Mumbai based relative||A 36-year-old Lucknow man was arrested for allegedly raping his Mumbai-based relative and blackmailing her after making an objectionable video of the woman, said police officials here on Saturday. They said the woman had lodged an FIR against the accused in Mumbai on September 30 earlier this year and the case was transferred to Lucknow as the crime was committed here.Lucknow commissioner of police (CP) DK Thakur said the accused was identified as Pawan Kumar Tripathi, the resident of A Block, Indira Nagar under Ghazipur police station limits and he was arrested from his hideout near Juggauli crossing in Gomti Nagar on Saturday.Sharing more details, another police officer said Tripathi worked in a private bank while the victim woman earlier used to live in Lucknow along with his family and shifted to Mumbai after marriage. He said the accused raped the woman when she was in Lucknow but she did not complain about the matter due to social stigma and approached police in Mumbai when the former continued harassing her as well as blackmailing by threatening to make her objectionable video viral.He said the accused was booked under the Indian Penal Code sections 376 for rape, 354 for sexual harassment, 504 for insult and 506 for criminal intimidation. He said the accused has been sent to jail in judicial custody after producing him before the competent court and further investigation in the matter is on.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lucknow-man-held-for-raping-blackmailing-his-mumbai-based-relative-101636827950237.html
13-11-2021||Noida||Buyers allege‘scam’ in employees’ housing project in Greater Noida||Homebuyers of the Central government employees’ welfare housing organisation’s (CGEWHO) housing project -- ‘Kendriya Vihar Greater Noida’ in pocket 4 -- on Saturday staged a protest against a delay in delivery of flats and also alleged a scam in altering the original layout of the project reportedly in violation of rules. Around 100 home buyers reached gate number 1 of the project at 11am and raised slogans against the office-bearers of the CGEWHO committee, which is managing the project, before leaving the site at 3pm.This project in Greater Noida was announced in 2011 and touted as the biggest dream project for Central government employees. “However the work at the site could start only in 2016 after a long delay, and it was assured that flats will be delivered by February 2021. But the project is still incomplete even though they have collected the total flat cost from buyers in March last year. The bigger issue is that they are illegally constructing villas costing upto ₹1.6 crore that a Central government employee cannot buy as per the service rules.It means making and selling villas in this project is unlawful by all means,” said former diplomat PC Mishra, who retired from the Indian embassy in Peru, and is leading the protest.“They kept 30 acres for phase 1 and 8 acres for phase 2. But later, they moved 6 acres from phase 1 to phase 2 illegally, and launched the villa project on 14 acres. It cannot be done because they cannot change the land use like this,” added Mishra.The home buyers’ group claimed that the CGEWHO had bought 38 acres land from the Greater Noida authority in 2011 with an aim to provide housing facilities to Central government employees in towers with a maximum of 14 floors. As per the layout plan, the society has on offer 1BHK, 2 BHK, 3 BHK and 4BHK flats, with sizes ranging from 850 sqft to 2,170 sqft. “We demand audit by the comptroller and auditor general appointed by the Ministry of housing and urban affairs; immediate removal of office-bearers of the society; completion of the project as per schedule, and handing over the units to buyers; formation of the apartment owners’ association to stop corruption in this project,” said Brij Mohan Saxena, retired deputy secretary, Ministry of finance.Buyers questioned why the scheme, launched in the name of providing affordable housing facilities to Central government employees, would include villas for ₹1.6 crore.“How can a government employee buy a villa for ₹1.6 crore and why is the society doing it for profit as the scheme is meant as no-profit, no-loss initiative,” added Saxena.They alleged that the society office-bearers have obtained the permission to construct villas wrongly and launched a second phase, which was not there in the original plan.“We got the map for the second phase, in which villas are proposed, approved after consent from homebuyers, as per rules. The project is managed by a project monitoring committee appointed by the members. The project got delayed only because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Following the pandemic, the Uttar Pradesh real estate regulatory authority gave us an extension and allowed completion of units by May 2022. All allegations made by buyers are untrue and we will hand over possession before May,” said Gagan, director, CGEWHO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/buyers-allege-scam-in-employees-housing-project-in-greater-noida-101636827470419.html
13-11-2021||Delhi||For office-goers in Delhi, ‘work from home’ an ideal option||New Delhi: With pollution hitting ‘severe’ levels in the city, the Delhi government on Saturday said that it will issue a work from home (WFH) advisory to private offices -- a move which was largely welcomed by working professionals even as a few expressed apprehensions of a break in the regular work momentum.Many office-goers said that while work from home is ideal amid the spiralling pollution levels, they added that such decisions could not be enforced by all companies, especially at a time when work was slowly returning to normalcy amid the pandemic. Riyaz, an HR professional, said that while the repercussions of pollution on health can’t be taken lightly, reverting to work from home would break the work momentum. “Personally, I feel that we should adopt work from home... If the weather is not conducive for employees, people will not feel good. An unhealthy employee coming to office will not be very productive,” said Riyaz, who prefers to use his first name. The South Delhi resident said that while there had been some discussion regarding switching to work from home amid pollution concerns, the company has not issued any work from home advisory so far. “If one looks from the business point of view, there will be a sudden break in the momentum of people returning to the office, and a disruption in the day-to-day work. At a time when the business has already been affected due to Covid, such decisions will need a lot of thinking. Offices have not functioned normally for one-and-a-half years due to Covid and we will need to take a very calculated step,” said Riyaz.Amit Bhatt, executive director (integrated urban transport), WRI India, said that if people who can work from home do so, it would improve the transport situation and people on the roads will breathe easier.“Air quality is worse on roads in comparison to other areas. If traffic congestion is eased, people will take lesser time to reach home and will breathe in less toxic pollutants. There will be fewer emissions since there are fewer vehicles on the streets. However, I don’t think that all activities can take place remotely,” said Bhatt. Bhamini Shenoy, who works with a law firm having offices in Delhi and NCR, said that she will opt for work from home if given the choice. “Due to pollution, I can regularly feel my eyes burning and throat itching. There is visible congestion in the air. At least till the time the situation in the city becomes better, I’d prefer to work from home,” said Shenoy. She, however, added that all employees could not afford to work from home. “ The senior management that engages with clients will need to come to office even if an advisory is issued. Associates have been given the choice to work from home due to pollution,” said Shenoy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/for-office-goers-in-delhi-work-from-home-an-ideal-option-101636827290352.html
13-11-2021||Lucknow||UPites will no longer have to migrate for jobs: Rajnath||Lucknow: The state capital took a giant leap in defence manufacturing on Saturday when union defence minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated the first operationalised private sector manufacturing facility of the defence sector in the Uttar Pradesh Defence Industrial Corridor. Aerolloy Technologies, a wholly owned subsidiary of the PTC industries, Lucknow, will manufacture parts for aircraft engines, helicopter engines, structural parts for aircrafts, drones and UAVs, submarines, ultra-light artillery guns, space launch vehicles and strategy systems among others. Rajnath also laid the foundation stone of an integrated metal manufacturing facility of the PTC industries. This facility will produce key raw materials in titanium and other exotic alloys for aerospace applications. This plant will reduce the country’s dependence on imports for all platforms which require titanium and nickel super alloys. Addressing the gathering, Rajnath Singh said: “Such investments will mean that the people of Uttar Pradesh would no longer have to leave their homes in search of employment.” Singh also expressed confidence that private sector companies would invest in UP and said the state government would provide all possible support to them. Singh also urged the PTC Industries to make the local community a partner in their success by adopting local ITI, apprenticeship programme, schools and hospitals. “This will be a true contribution to society and the country”, he said. Singh was hopeful of increased investment by private companies in Lucknow and Uttar Pradesh at large. The minister also exhorted the private sector to invest in research and development. “In the last seven years, our defence exports have crossed ₹38,000 crore and more than 10,000 SMEs have joined the defence sector. Research and development, start-up, innovation and employment have also increased as a result of these policies,” Singh said. Industrial development minister, UP, Satish Mahana expressed confidence that Uttar Pradesh would become the most preferred destination for investment. Sanjay Jaju, additional secretary, defence production, union government, stated that infrastructure and other facilities offered by the UP Defence Industrial Corridor would attract fresh investment in all six nodes of the defence corridor. Awanish Awasthi, CEO, UPEIDA, assured that the state government would ensure land availability and logistical support for all investors. On February 21, 2018, PM Narendra Modi had announced ₹20,000 crore Defence Industrial Corridor in Bundelkhand region which is considered as one of the most backward regions in the state. The UP Expressways Industrial Development Authority (UPEIDA) is executing the project. The defence corridor, which is expected to generate more than one lakh jobs, has six nodes, including Aligarh, Agra, Jhansi, Chitrakoot, Kanpur and Lucknow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/upites-will-no-longer-have-to-migrate-for-jobs-rajnath-101636826990705.html
13-11-2021||Gurugram||Haryana pollution body suggests fewer trips, tells people to stay indoor||Gurugram: For the second consecutive day, pollution levels remained in the severe category in the city, which forced the pollution authorities to recommend a series of measures, including reducing number of private vehicles on the road and limiting outdoor activities. The AQI was recorded at 441 on Saturday, slightly lower than the 448 registered on Friday. The air quality monitoring stations in the city recorded a reading of 451 at Gwal Pahari, 438 at Teri Gram, 445 at Vikas Sadan, and 431 at sector 51. Experts said a combination of low windspeed, temperature drop and farm fires contributed to severe pollution levels. To check the high pollution levels, the Haryana State Pollution Control Board officials on Friday issued directions that recommendations of the sub committee on graded response action plan (Grap) on pollution must be implemented strictly. The sub-committee on Grap, in a written order, advised the government and private offices to reduce vehicle use by at least by 30% by focusing on work from home option, promoting car pooling and optimising field activities. It also advised people to reduce outdoor activities and minimise exposure to pollutants. The board, however, directed all implementation agencies to closely monitor actions being taken by various agencies and submit daily report to respective pollution boards. “Some of the directions under Grap are mandatory and some are advisory in nature, like pushing for more public transport and reducing use of private vehicles. The implementing agencies must monitor action taken and ensure compliance,” said S Narayanan, member secretary, Haryana State Pollution Control Board. Gurugram’s air quality plummetted into the “very poor” AQI on Diwali, on November 4. For the next three days, the air quality dipped into “severe” category, which implies that the air quality is hazardous and may cause respiratory effects even to healthy people and serious health impacts to people with lung or heart diseases. Gurugram’s air improved slightly to “very poor” on November 8, and has now deteriorated again into the “severe” category.On Saturday, the IMD recorded wind speed at 12-13kmph, double the 6kmph recorded on Friday. The minimum temperature touched 11.3 degrees Celsius (°C) on Saturday, three degrees lower than normal, and the maximum temperature was 25.5°C. Dr Anurani Sharma, associate professor, Teri School of Advanced Studies, said that the dip in temperature will be a regular feature for the next 15-20 days as a result of which the pollutants in the air will not dissipate and AQI will remain in the ‘severe’ or ‘very poor’ category. “The increase in wind speed can help in moving the pollutants away from Delhi-NCR but the situation is likely to remain grim as the local pollution is quite large and urgent steps are needed to curb it,” she said. In a related development, the department of town and country planning swung into action on Saturday and issued notices to 10 owners in DLF phase one for violating NGT norms and not taking measures to check pollution during construction. “The plot owners have kept the building material in open and have not covered the construction site with proper tin sheds and were causing pollution in the nearby areas. Considering the condition of Air Quality department is keeping vigil on the construction sites and violators are being penalised ,” said RS Bhath, district town planner, enforcement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/haryana-pollution-body-suggests-fewer-trips-tells-people-to-stay-indoor-101636826691796.html
13-11-2021||Mumbai||After violence in Amravati, political parties in Maharashtra begin blame game||The violent protests in parts of the state have triggered a blame game between the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi and opposition Bharatiya Janata Party. While the Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) have said that it’s a conspiracy to create communal tension, the BJP has said that state government will have to take the responsibility if the situation went out of hand. The NCP has demanded action against former Shia Board chairman Wasim Rizvi. “The protests were against Tripura violence and the books published by former Shia Waqf Board president Wasim Rizvi. It was the responsibility of the outfits that had given the bandh call to ensure that it was observed in a peaceful manner. They cannot shrug off the responsibility. The Central government should also ensure action against Rizvi who has been facing many cases of scams and irregularities,” said NCP leader and state minority affairs minister Nawab Malik. Rizvi, who is former head of Shia Central Waqf Board is facing CBI investigation for the alleged irregularities and illegal sale and purchase of Waqf properties. Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole said that the violence is an attempt of the BJP to create communal tension ahead of the Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls. BJP lawmaker Atul Bhatkhalkar demanded a ban on Raza Academy, which had called the bandh. Bhatkhalkar said that Raza Academy was being used to create communal divide by instigating people in the community. “The state government should immediately propose a ban on the outfit and send the proposal to the Centre,” he said. Saeed Noori , general secretary, Raza Academy said that the call given by them for bandh was for a peaceful protest but there were deliberate attempts to give it a communal turn. “We had made it very clear that it should be peaceful and there should be no use of force. The violence is the handiwork of some elements who want to create communal tension,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/after-violence-in-amravati-political-parties-in-maharashtra-begin-blame-game-101636826690558.html

13-11-2021||Gurugram||House help part of gang behind spate of thefts in Gurugram held, 3 on the run||Gurugram: The city police on Friday arrested one member of a gang allegedly behind a spate of robberies in different areas of Delhi-NCR, with investigators saying that they gained entry into the target houses by posing as house helps and carried out the thefts when the families were away.Police said they have recovered jewellery worth ₹50 lakh and added that three more members of the gang, including the husband of the arrested woman, are on the run. According to police, the gang is behind at least three thefts in Gurugram in the last three months.Police said the theft were allegedly carried out in pairs -- a woman would start working as a house help to gain access to the house and scan for valuables, and the second person, who would pose as her cousin, would take away the loot when the family is away from the house. Police said the house help too would later make some excuse and flee the house the same day.Police said that there are over 10 such gangs, mostly from West Bengal, operating across the city.Police said agencies providing domestic helps are also under scanner after their role was highlighted by suspects in the past. The arrest in the present case is related to a complaint filed by a resident of Silver Oak Apartments in DLF Phase 1 who alleged that their domestic help fled with cash and jewellery worth lakhs. A case was registered and the investigation was handed over to the crime team. The complainant told the police that the domestic help, who was hired last month, had avoided sharing her personal details for police verification. However, since he needed a domestic help urgently, his mother employed her without completing the verification, he said. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that the initial probe led us to the suspect’s cousin, who was asked to join the probe. He gave us her hometown address and contact numbers of his family members. “The teams traced the suspect’s location and arrested her from Sonpur village in West Bengal. The suspect had boarded train and had fled along with her husband and two others after committing the theft,” he said. The suspect, identified as Luxmi, a resident of Behrampur in Murshidabad of West Bengal, was taken on three-day police remand and, after recovery, was sent to judicial remand on Saturday, said police. Police said the team recovered eight gold bangles, four gold chains, eight pairs of gold earrings, eight gold rings, two small gold chains, four gold pendants, 11 silver coins, and three locker keys from her possession. Sangwan said in all such cases, the households had hired a woman who, after working for a few days or a month, would decamp with cash and jewellery with the help of an associate. “The gang members would conduct recce in different parts of the city and spoke to security guards and other staff members of maintenance agency to find out the requirement for a house help,” he said.Similar cases were reported from Nirvana Country, Sector 56, 57, Sohna Road, Palam Vihar and Sector 47 this year. Sangwan said last year 11 women and six men were arrested for stealing cash and jewellery from residential areas after taking up jobs as domestic help. “The gang operates in pairs and enters the society after narrating stories of poverty and hunger to security guards and gaining their trust. They then take up jobs and later flee after stealing valuables,” he said. Police said the victims are families which do not conduct verification of house helps. “The residents should get the verification done before hiring them,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/house-help-part-of-gang-behind-spate-of-thefts-in-gurugram-held-3-on-the-run-101636826090198.html
13-11-2021||Lucknow||Uneasy calm in Agra locality after communal tension, force deployed||Agra Uneasy calm prevailed in Shahganj area here on Saturday, with heavy force deployment, after Friday night’s communal tension. The flare-up was a sequel to a woman’s body found hanging in her in-laws’ house. The woman and her husband belonged to different religions. A case was registered against five named accused and three of them, including husband of the deceased, were arrested. The body was cremated after post mortem examination. As per reports, the woman had married a man from the minority community about a year ago. Her body was found hanging in her in-laws’ house who said it was a suicide. But the parents of the deceased, also from Agra, alleged a dowry death. The matter took a communal turn and rival groups came face to face after BJP Yuva Morcha leaders led by Gaurav Rajawat reached the area. They were reportedly called by the brother of the deceased woman. The markets were closed on Friday night after some of the shops were targeted. Heavy police force led by SSP Agra Sudhir Kumar Singh reached the spot and the situation was brought under control.

13-11-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai hits 100% first dose mark; many still not inoculated||Three hundred and one days after the nationwide Covid-19 vaccination programme was rolled out on January 16, Mumbai achieved 100% first dose coverage on Saturday, November 13. The city’s eligible adult population is 9,236,546, and by 10pm last night, 9,253,647 were vaccinated with at least one dose, 0.18% higher than the target. At the same time, 6,033,148 people were given the second dose according to the Central government’s CoWin dashboard, taking the city’s full vaccination coverage to 65%. To be sure, Mumbai may have statistically achieved the milestone of 100% first dose coverage, but the city will have to administer many more doses to truly cover its entire adult population. The reason: An estimated 10-20% people who have got the Covid-19 vaccine in Mumbai are likely to be from other parts of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) or the rest of Maharashtra. “We are definitely accounting for this slight mismatch. Therefore, our vaccination drive will continue aggressively,” said Mumbai’s executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare. “We will have to reach much beyond 100%,” she said. The last mile coverage may therefore be a few more days away, experts said, and a small percentage of the population could still choose to remain unvaccinated due to personal choice, hesitancy or other reasons. “No other district in the country has managed to reach the 100% target in such a short time,” said Mumbai’s additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. “It has been a collective effort. We achieved it because of the sincere contribution of all municipal workers, private hospitals, NGOs and people on the ground.” Mumbai reached the 1 million doses (both doses included) mark on March 25. The 9 million doses landmark was attained on August 24. On September 4, Mumbai became the first district in India to administer 10 million doses, and on November 10, it crossed the 15 million mark. As of Saturday, Mumbai had administered 15,286,627 combined doses. According to Kakani, decentralising vaccination centres played a crucial role in achieving the target. As the city moves to increase its first dose coverage beyond 100% and achieve the second dose target, new, micro strategies are being designed. Infectious disease expert and member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force Dr Om Srivastava said that 100% first dose coverage is “great news.” “It means the city is better protected than earlier. But we cannot let our guard down. The virus is unpredictable, and there are countries that are seeing large number of cases even now. France has announced it is experiencing a fifth wave,” he said. On Friday, World Health Organisation chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Covid-19 cases were not only surging in eastern European countries with lower vaccination rates, but also in western Europe, which is among the world’s highest vaccinated geographies. Vaccination in Mumbai first began on January 16 along with the rest of the country for healthcare workers; on February 5 for frontline workers; on March 1 for citizens above 60 years of age; on April 1 for citizens in 45-59 years age group; and on May 1 for all adult citizens. Vaccination for lactating mothers began on May 26, and for pregnant women from July 14. On Day One, Mumbai had just 10 vaccinations centres, but that number has grown to 462 public and private vaccination centres with a capacity of over 123,000 inoculations per day. Dr Naveen Thacker, vaccination expert and a former civil society organisation representative to GAVI, the vaccine alliance, said, “Mumbai has shown 100% vaccination is achievable. Other districts in the country should follow suit. This should be a barrier between the city and the anticipated third wave,” he said. So far this month, in Maharashtra, Covid numbers seem to be declining gradually. The first 13 days of November saw a 61.14% drop in cases compared to the first 13 days of October. Similarly, on October 13, active cases in the state totalled 29,555. On November 13, they had dropped 58.65% to 12,219. The corresponding active cases for Mumbai were 5997 and 3577, a drop of 40.65%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-hits-100-first-dose-mark-many-still-not-inoculated-101636825490361.html

13-11-2021||Bangalore||No Bitcoin scam, says BJP; No foul play in investigation: Bengaluru police||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Saturday dismissed the Congress party's allegations on the Bitcoin issue cover-up, saying there was no scam. The Bengaluru police too refuted the charges of foul play in the investigation and cover-up exercises. "There has been absolutely no scam of whatsoever nature or dimension it could be. Therefore any questions of having any actors in this scam is a perverted imagination. However, new actors have emerged making mountain out of a mole, and making baseless allegations, based on distorted facts of the case," BJP's Karnataka unit spokesperson Ganesh Karnik said in a statement. He was reacting to Congress allegations that 'influential politicians' are involved in the scam after officials seized bitcoins worth ₹nine crore from a city based hacker, Srikrishna alias Sriki, who is also accused of hacking into government portals, sourcing drugs through the dark net and paying for it through cryptocurrency. Congress general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala alleged in a press conference in Delhi on Saturday that the size of the scam could be much bigger because just on two days on December 1, 2020 and April 14, 2021 illegal transactions worth ₹5,240 crore took place. He posed a series of questions to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and asked what was the role of Karnataka Chief Minister Basaravaj Bommai, who was the state's home minister when the scam took place. Surjewala also demanded to know why international investigative agencies, including the Interpol, were not informed about the stolen Bitcoins. Apparently referring to the Congress leaders as 'new actors', Karnik said they were continuously carrying out a slanderous campaign by releasing distorted and partial facts for cheap popularity, "in utter disregard to the fact that the case is sub judice and pending before the Trial Court". He claimed that neither had any Bitcoins been transferred from the account of hacker Srikrishna nor any bitcoin been lost. Meanwhile, the Bengaluru police issued a statement to clear the air and said that the investigation was conducted by the Central Crime Branch "in a fair and professional manner." "It is emphatically stated that such misleading versions are being floated based on incomplete/distorted facts. All such versions are vehemently denied," the police said. Based on the credible information on November 4, 2020 on a drug consignment procured through the darknet, CCB Police secured one accused and seized 500 grams of Hydro Ganja. During further investigation, 10 other accused persons, including Srikrishna, alias Sriki were secured and arrested. During interrogation, Srikrishna confessed before the Investigating Officer about his involvement in alleged hacking of many Crypto Currency websites. "It is stated that neither were any Bitcoins transferred from the account of hacker Srikrishna nor was any Bitcoin lost. It is a fact that for the purpose of investigation of Crypto Currency, it was felt necessary to open a Bitcoin account," the police said. It added that on December 8, 2020, government permission was obtained to open a Bitcoin account. "During the process of identifying and seizure of bitcoins, accused Srikrishna showed a BTC wallet, which contained 31.8 BTC. The wallet password was changed in the presence of cyber experts, Government panchas and the entire procedure was recorded under mahazer and submitted to the court," the police said. Further, the Court's permission was obtained to use password to transfer the said Bitcoins to the police wallet account. Upon reaching the said wallet shown by Srikrishna, it showed 186.811 Bitcoins, police said, adding that the Cyber experts opined that the said account claimed by the accused as his personal account was in fact a live wallet of an exchange and the accused did not have private key for this. "Hence, the said account was left untouched and as a result, no BITCOINS were transferred to Police wallet. The case has been chargesheeted along with the above facts and related documents and is now subjudice," police said. They said that at no stage was anything done which could jeopardise a fair investigation and the process of law. They claimed that investigation was done by a team of professional officers under close supervision and in continuous consultation and in the presence of reputed and external experts, without any external influence or interference. On the claim made on Whale Alert's Twitter handle that 14,682 stolen bitfinex bitcoins were transferred, police said they were completely unsubstantiated. "There is nothing to suggest that it had originated from Bengaluru. The law enforcement system and investigating agencies work on certain procedures laid down by law of the land," the statement read. It further said that till date no foreign law enforcement agencies or any foreign companies have approached Bengaluru police about any hacking. "Even representatives of Bitfinex company have neither shared any details of the alleged hack nor sought any information so far," police said. On the claims of Srikrishna about high volume hacking of websites, police said the careful examination of digital evidence by the cyber experts revealed that majority of his claims were unsubstantiated. It also said that Bengaluru police have informed CBI, Enforcement Directorate and Interpol through proper channels this year. Regarding the charge that Srikrishna was allegedly forced to consume Alprazolam during police custody, police said that on the direction of the court, his blood and urine samples were collected at Bowring Hospital and submitted to the Forensic Science Laboratory for scientific examination. After examination, the FSL gave a negative report, stating that there was no presence of drugs, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/no-bitcoin-scam-says-bjp-no-foul-play-in-investigation-bengaluru-police-101636824566600.html

13-11-2021||Lucknow||UP to get DAP fertiliser as per its requirement for Nov, Dec, assures Centre||The Centre has assured the Uttar Pradesh government that shortage of diammonium phosphate (DAP) will not be allowed to take place in the state as all coordinated efforts are being made to ensure farmers get adequate supply of the fertiliser in November and December to meet their sowing requirements.State chief secretary Rajendra Kumar Tiwari and other officials of the agriculture department on Friday held a meeting with Union secretary, fertilisers, RK Chaturvedi here to discuss the prevailing shortage of the DAP, the second most consumed fertiliser after urea in the state. “The secretary, fertilisers, assured us that the DAP would be made available to the state as per its requirement and no shortage would be allowed to hit the sowing in the state,” the chief secretary said.“We on our part have made necessary arrangements to ensure smooth distribution of the fertiliser to farmers by acting against those indulging into black marketing,” he added. The Centre’s assurance comes amid news of farmers waiting in long queues outside cooperative societies to procure the fertiliser and even staging protests and blocking roads in various districts to draw authorities’ attention to the crisis.The DAP shortage has occurred in the state at a time when the assembly polls are only three months away and the Opposition parties are already making this a big issue by turning heat on the government for its alleged failure to make the DAP available to farmers.The DAP as a fertiliser is used as a basal dose before sowing of crops like potato and wheat in the state and Agra and Aligarh regions that are termed as potato belts are said to be the worst affected by the shortage. Additional chief secretary, agriculture, Devesh Chaturvedi who was privy to the Friday’s meeting, said the countrywide shortage of the DAP occurred due to sharp increase in the global import prices. The DAP, he pointed out, was not produced in the country and had to be sourced from other countries, largely the Gulf countries.“Despite the shortage, we tried out best to make the fertiliser available to farmers to avoid the sowing getting delayed and the Centre has told us that adequate amount of DAP will be provided to UP in November and December,” he said.According to Chaturvedi, UP’s requirement of DAP for the current month was estimated to be 6 lakh tons of which 2.25 lakh tons was already made available to the state by November 11 even as 3 lakh tons was also available in the stock. The December requirement, he said, was only 3 lakh tons.“The supply continues to come with the rakes being in transit and we are sending the fertiliser to the districts as per their requirement,” he said adding “We have also coordinated with the Railways for early and seamless arrival of rakes of fertiliser.The shortage, he said, was also due to the delayed arrival of rakes that came from very far-off places. “The Railways has set up a special cell to monitor and ensure that rakes take as less time as possible to reach their destination and return,” Chaturvedi said. He said there was no shortage of urea in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-to-get-dap-fertiliser-as-per-its-requirement-for-nov-dec-assures-centre-101636824770220.html

13-11-2021||Lucknow||For them, Children’s Day also means raising awareness about child trafficking||For 13-year-old Amit Chauhan, who hails from Bharwaliya—a small village on porous Indo-Nepal border in Maharajganj district of Uttar Pradesh—celebrating Children’s Day is not just about remembering Chacha Nehru, cultural programmes and gorging upon ‘boondi ke laddoo’ (a traditional sweet) but also about creating awareness about child trafficking and the ways to identify child traffickers to which his village and others on the Nepal border are vulnerable too. “Children’s Day is celebrated here with great fervour. But, other than celebrating the day and the birth anniversary of our first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, we also take this occasion as an opportunity to spread awareness about child-trafficking that is a heinous crime,” said Chauhan, an active member of anti-child-trafficking-unit (ACTU), an initiative of a local NGO Manav Sewa Sansthan that works to keep a check on human trafficking in bordering villages. The 13-year-old added that this exercise became all the more important in present Covid-19 crisis times when hundreds of children were rendered orphans and homeless. “I am not alone. We are a team of children, all belonging to the same village, and our job is to keep a watch on any unfamiliar faces and also the children arriving in the village and to alert the senior people with the NGO,” said Chauhan who studies in class 5 at primary school Bharwaliya. Another member of ACTU operating in Bharwaliya village, Sangam Kumari (14), said they have got training for the same. “On spotting any suspicious or unfamiliar person accompanied with a child, we first try to interact with the kid and try to extract details from them like their house address, parents, native place, Aadhaar card number and so on. On getting unconvincing response, we at once inform our seniors,” she said. NGO director Rajesh Mani said “Children’s Day is a good occasion to make kids aware about their rights, especially human trafficking. The issue is even more important given the present pandemic time when such disasters are seen as an opportunity by the traffickers.” Mani, who has been working in this field for the last 32 years, said the bordering villages of Maharajganj witnessed a similar situation during 2015 Nepal earthquake. “Back then, locals had played a crucial role when they helped in freeing many kids from the clutches of a trafficking gang with the help of police and Seema Suraksha Bal (SSB) forces. Alone from Sonauli border around 120 cases of human trafficking were reported,” he said. Other than Bharwaliya, the NGO has activated the ACTUs in some 80 villages spread across districts like Pilibhit, Lakhimpur, Siddharthnagar and Bahraich that fall on the 470-km long Indo-Nepal border which passes through UP. There are broadly 8 main transit points that includes Sonauli and Toothibari in Maharajganj district; Khanua, Bandhni and Kakrawa in Siddharthnagar district; Rupaidhia in Bahraich district and Gauriphanta and Tikonia in Lakhimpur Kheri district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/for-them-children-s-day-also-means-raising-awareness-about-child-trafficking-101636823870256.html
13-11-2021||Chandigarh||BJP, RSS hit back on Mehbooba’s ISIS remark, call her spent force||The Jammu and Kashmir Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) hit back strongly to PDP president and former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti’s remarks against the BJP and RSS, wherein she compared them with the Islamic State (ISIS) on Saturday. “Mehbooba Mufti has always supported terror outfits like Hizbul Mujahideen, Lashkar, Jaish, Taliban and separatists Hurriyat Conference. She has always encouraged anti-India agenda. She has all the sympathy with separatists and terrorists,” said J&K BJP Ravinder Raina. “Those who talk in Talibani language and toe the agenda of Pakistan are preaching us Hindutva and Hinduism. She should first look deep into her own conscience,” he asked. Raina said that she was the same Mehbooba Mufti who at the time of Amarnath land row in 2008 had run anti-Hindu campaign. “Entire world knows her. She is trying to do politics of hatred but we won’t allow her to succeed in her designs,” he added. Former deputy chief minister Kavinder Gupta said, “The unfounded remarks made by Mehbooba Mufti against the Bharatiya Janata Party have no takers in the country as her divisive agenda has already been exposed,” he said. Gupta said, the PDP is a spent force now and its chief is trying her best to revive the party. RSS North Zone Vyavastha Pramukh and president of Shri Sanatan Dharam Sabha in J&K, Parshottam Dadhichi said, “Sanatan is Sanatan. It is a way of life. It can’t be compared and it can’t be hijacked.”“As far as RSS is concerned, we work for nation-building and we believe in the adage ‘Sarve Bhavantu Sukhinah’. I can only express regrets over the low thinking of Mehbooba Mufti. She has not understood the ethics of the RSS. Many courts of the nation, including Supreme Court and Delhi High Court, have said that RSS is not a communal organisation. It is really unfortunate on the part of PDP president to drag and malign apolitical organisation like RSS, which firmly believes in oneness of the people of India.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bjp-rss-hit-back-on-mehbooba-s-isis-remark-call-her-spent-force-101636823690248.html
13-11-2021||Lucknow||Annapurna Devi idol receives warm welcome as it passes through Lucknow||The Annapurna Devi idol, which was brought back from Canada recently, received a warm welcome with priests chanting hymns and showering petals in Lucknow on Saturday.The Annapurna Devi idol is to be installed at the Kashi Vishwanath temple in Varanasi on November 15.On Thursday (November 11), the Union ministry of culture had handed over the idol of the goddess to Uttar Pradesh (UP) minister Suresh Rana at a ceremony held at New Delhi’s National Gallery of Modern Art. Several ministers of the Yogi Adityanath government became part of the yatra. Law minister Brajesh Pathak travelled with the Annapurna Devi idol from Kanpur till Lucknow. At Sarojininagar in Lucknow, local BJP MLA and UP minister Swati Singh became part of the procession after the idol received a warm welcome. Another senior minister Ashutosh Tandon became part of the yatra at Hazratganj. “Law minister Brajesh Pathak accompanied the yatra’s Lucknow leg and was also seen distributing prasad,” said Lucknow BJP leader Praveen Garg. “Lucknow mayor Sanyukta Bhatia was seen with the procession and the flower bedecked vehicle on which the 18th century beautifully carved idol of the goddess, measuring 17x9x4 cm, was placed,” Garg said. Near the BJP headquarters in Lucknow, UP BJP general secretary (organization) Sunil Bansal, along with general secretary Govind Narayan Shukla, lawmaker Neeraj Bora and several others welcomed the yatra. The procession passed through 1090 crossing, Samta Mulak Chauraha and Lohia crossing before reaching the polytechnic crossing. The BJP leaders said that the Annapurna Devi idol will now be placed in Varanasi, the spot from where it had been stolen about 100 years ago. “Ever since Modiji has become Prime Minister, the country’s treasure that was stolen away, is now coming back. Like the idol of the goddess, the antiquities of other states would be similarly handed over to the respective state governments,” the BJP leaders said.From Delhi, the yatra headed to Aligarh on November 11, from where it travelled to Kannauj on November 12. After Lucknow, it would move to Ayodhya. It will finally reach Varanasi on November 15 and would be placed at the Kashi Vishwanath temple after elaborate rituals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/annapurna-devi-idol-receives-warm-welcome-as-it-passes-through-lucknow-101636823330229.html

13-11-2021||Lucknow||‘Massive’ support on UP CM’s turf indication of BJP govt’s exit: Akhilesh||Samajwadi Party (SP) national president Akhilesh Yadav on Saturday attacked the BJP government on a number of issues ranging from rising fuel prices, farm laws, unemployment, privatisation and Covid pandemic while reiterating his claim that his party will come to power in the state with a thumping majority. Assembly polls are slated to be held in Uttar Pradesh early next year. Addressing a well-attended rally in Madapur area on the outskirts of Gorakhpur city after launching the third phase of his Samajwadi Vijay Yatra with a massive roadshow, he claimed, “This great excitement, enthusiasm and support that too in Babaji’s (a reference to CM Yogi Adityanath) region shows that this government (BJP) is on its way out as it has insulted and cheated people. No one has ever made such large numbers of fake promises as this government has done.” He further claimed that the SP was coming to power with a huge mandate and that the change will start from Gorakhpur. Taking a jibe at the CM, Akhilesh said, “Do you know why laptops are not being distributed? Because our Babaji doesn’t know how to use it.”As the yatra sees the SP chief travel on a bus, which has been converted into a “rath”, Akhilesh addressed people from atop this “rath” as he also waved a mace to people as a victory gesture. Attacking the BJP government over its “failure” in handling the pandemic, the former CM alleged, “Do you remember how our labourers walked on foot to home in huge numbers from various parts of the country, including Gujarat and Maharashtra? However, this government did nothing for them.”“Back then, the poor desperately needed hospitals, medicines and oxygen but the government failed to supply them, leading to uncountable deaths. Even today, this government is not able to provide proper treatment to the poor,” he further alleged.On rising fuel prices, the SP leader alleged, “In the last three months, the profit earned by oil companies has gone up to six hundred times. Can BJP tell where all this money is going? This is the BJP which is filling the pockets of the rich by cutting the pockets of the poor. They have sold off public properties from airport to railways. It was already a ‘Pheku Sarkar’ (a government which boasts of its achievements) which has now become a ‘Bechu Sarkar’ (a government which is selling off public properties).” “The (BJP) government had promised that it will make air travel so cheaper that even those who wear slippers only will be able to travel in planes . Leave alone the affordable plane travel, the common man is finding it difficult to use even a motorcycle as petrol prices have made a century (have crossed ₹100-mark),” Akhilesh said.Supporting the farmers’ ongoing stir against the Centre’s three farm laws, the former CM said, “This government is not listening to the demands of the farmers who have been staging a demonstration since long as the government doesn’t worry about them but about its rich friends. If this government comes to power again, it will crush the farmers’ movement.”Seeking people’s support for his party, he also said the forthcoming UP election would be a battle to save all four pillars of democracy and the Indian Constitution.

Amit Shah, who inaugurated Sansad Khel Mahakumbh in Basti district of eastern Uttar Pradesh, also lauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is the Varanasi MP, for giving funds to ensure that the state gets the maximum benefit of government schemes and development projects, helping it emerge as the country’s second largest economy. “Development of a state is not possible if riots occur. Earlier, riots and curfew were frequent in Uttar Pradesh. Since the Yogi Adityanath government has come to power, no riots have taken place,” Amit Shah said. The home minister also said, “Now, no mafias can be seen in Purvanchal (eastern UP). Those who came here to make people migrate, have now migrated themselves. Earlier, the police force had the fear of musclemen, but now these musclemen come to the police begging not to shoot them and pleading for surrender.” “PM Modi himself is the MP from UP’s Varanasi and for this reason he has loosened the government purse strings for development,” he said. “UP was adjudged the best state under the smart cities mission, got second rank in MSME, holds the record for maximum distribution of LPG, construction of toilets and maximum power connections. UP has become the second largest economy of the country,” he said.“PM Modi and CM Yogi have done a lot of work and a lot of work is still to be done. For this, we need your support, love and blessings. Give us a record victory in the upcoming election, “ he said.Amit Shah asked the crowd to pledge for BJP’s record victory by raising their hands and chanting Bharat Mata ki Jai. He recalled his 2016 visit to Basti and thanked people for giving a mandate to the BJP in the 2017 UP assembly elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uttar-pradesh-free-of-riots-under-yogi-says-amit-shah-101636821711759.html

But on the orders of the state government, the officials of Directorate of Education, Prayagraj, have prepared a proposal in this regard which will soon be sent to the government for approval,” said a senior education department official requesting anonymity. Under the changes being made, assistant teachers will also now be able to apply for the post of principals of government-aided intermediate colleges. “Till now, assistant teachers or trained graduate teachers (TGTs) teaching in high schools could only apply for the post of headmaster in government-aided high schools while post graduate teachers (PGTs) could apply for the post of principals of government-aided intermediate colleges. But now the new proposal aims at removing this barrier against assistant teachers applying for the post of principals in government-aided intermediate colleges if they possess the requisite eligibility as specified,” he added.The development comes close on the heels of a meeting chaired by special secretary, UP government, Jai Shankar Dubey on October 11 in Lucknow with representatives of the UP Secondary Teachers’ Association (Thakurai Group) in which the latter demanded recruitment of principals through a written examination and an opportunity to assistant teachers also to apply for the posts of principals in government-aided intermediate colleges—a fact duly noted in the confirmed minutes of the meeting dated November 2, 2021, a copy of which is with HT .State general secretary, UP Secondary Teachers’ Association (Thakurai Group), Lalmani Dwivedi said after this meeting, the process of duly amending the UP Secondary Education Services Selection Board Rules-1998 to make the changes possible had been started by the state education directorate.“As per the proposal, henceforth for the selection of principal and headmaster, a written examination of 300 marks (60 percent marks) out of the total 500 marks will be conducted. The remaining 200 marks will be earmarked for experience and interview,” another senior state education department official said.“The written exam will witness aspirants being tested through objective type questions regarding their general knowledge, educational aptitude, educational administration, school environment and health etc,” he added. Principals will be selected on the basis of a merit prepared at the state level instead of the divisional level as done presently, he said.Written examinations have started for the recruitment of principals in government-aided degree colleges of the state, but in government-aided secondary schools, selections are still being done through interviews.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/exams-to-recruit-principals-in-govt-aided-up-secondary-schools-soon-101636821710280.html

13-11-2021||Pune||October saw highest ever revenue collection of Rs3,200cr from stamp duty: Balasaheb Thorat||Maharashtra revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat hinted that the state economy is gradually returning to normalcy. He said that in October 2021, the state received Rs3,200 crore in revenue through stamp duty which is the highest ever in a month. He clarified that the state does not plan to give concession on stamp duty. Thorat was addressing a press conference in Pune after attending the ‘revenue conference’ at the Yashwantrao Chavan Academy of Development Administration (YASHADA).“During the pandemic of course, there was a lot of impact on the state revenue. Revenue received from stamp duty is a major source of income for us. In the beginning, offices were closed and it had a lot of impact. Then we took the decision of waiving stamp duty for five months and it yielded a lot of good results. Now things are gradually getting back to normal. In October 2021, we received the highest revenue so far from stamp duty of Rs3,200 crore. This is the highest so far,” Thorat said.The Maharashtra government on August 26, 2020 decided to temporarily reduce stamp duty on housing from 5% to 2% till December 31, 2020. From January 1, 2021 to March 31, 2021, stamp duty was increased from 2% to 3%. During FY2021-22, stamp duty was reinstated to 5%. Asked whether the state government is considering slashing stamp duty again, Thorat said there are no such plans as of now.“This decision (on stamp duty) proved to be a crucial one. On a national level too, it was appreciated that the decision helped restart the economic wheel. People completed their pending transactions. So even after giving concession, we received more revenue,” Thorat said. He claimed that the revenue department has been trying to promote online transactions and procedures. He also said that in the next six months, major reforms in land measurement procedures will be visible.“We are trying to bring in a lot of transparency in property registration procedures. We are now insisting that developers who have RERA registration should do it online from their offices. You will see a lot of changes in coming months in the land measurement procedures as well,” Thorat said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/october-saw-highest-ever-revenue-collection-of-rs3-200cr-from-stamp-duty-balasaheb-thorat-101636819430276.html

Vishwajeet Singh, 30, a former district board member from Dhamdaha, was shot dead at Sarsi village under Sarsi police station limits, about 40 km from Purnia town.While no FIR (first information report) had been lodged by family members of the deceased till Saturday afternoon, leader of Opposition in Bihar assembly, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), put the police in the dock. In a Twitter post, he wrote, “Singh had earlier complained to the police that he feared being killed by the nephew of minister Leshi Singh. But the police, acting as an agent of the ruling Janata Dal (United), failed to act and he was killed.” Police sources confirmed that Singh, in a police complaint on November 3, had apprehended threat to his life from one Ashish Singh, who is nephew of food and consumer protection minister Leshi Singh. He had lodged the complaint at Sarsi police station on November 3 after some criminals fired at him. The deceased’s wife, Anulika Singh, has been just elected as district board member from Dhamdaha in the ongoing panchayat polls.Purnia superintendent of police Daya Shankar said family members of the deceased had not yet lodged an FIR pertaining to the killing of Singh. Asked about the victim’s earlier complaint, the SP said, “SHO of Sarsi police station, Naresh Kumar, had been put under suspension. We are conducting raids to nab the accused.” In 2020 assembly polls, brother of one Bittu Singh, a notorious criminal who was then in jail, was shot dead in the same area. The family had then accused Leshi Singh of patronizing criminals who committed the crime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/local-leader-s-killing-in-purnia-stirs-protests-sho-suspended-101636818590042.html

Fifteen people, including three policemen, were injured when police resorted to lathi charge on Saturday.Shashikant Satav, a senior police officer, said that the police had to lathi-charge to control the violent mob. “The situation is tense but under control,” he further said.City commissioner of police Arti Singh said internet services in Amravati will remain suspended for three days to prevent the spread of rumours that could fuel violence.The bandh was called by the BJP in protest of the violent incidents during another bandh which was called by a section of people in the city on Friday against the vandalisation of a mosque in Tripura last month.Tension prevailed in many parts of the area since Saturday morning after some unidentified persons pelted stones at shops during protests. The violence broke out at Cotton Market, Rajkamal Chowk, Namuna, Jawahar Gate areas when a massive morcha was taken out by the BJP workers. Some people pelted stones on the shops and damaged them.Sandip Patil, the acting commissioner of police, stated that a curfew has been imposed in the city that excluded essential services, like medicines. Patil announced the indefinite curfew after fresh violence in the city this afternoon when several shops were set afire in Rajapeth and Namuna areas and crowds damaged the public and private properties.At least four battalions of state reserve police forces were deployed to maintain the law and order situation in the trouble-torn city.In protest against the communal riots in Tripura, some Muslim organisations declared a bandh in Amravati on Friday that witnessed violence in some areas in the city. The violent mob vandalised several shops and pelted stones.The BJP sponsored a protest against the Friday violence which led to massive crowds surging onto the roads, shouting slogans, carrying banners and saffron flags. Shortly, some sections resorted to pelting stones at private and government vehicles, shops and establishments, forcing the police to resort to mild caning to control the miscreants.Former Maharashtra minister and senior BJP leader Dr Anil Bonde, who was leading the march, claimed that the BJP workers were just protesting against the incident yesterday.“It was a totally peaceful march and the police deliberately resorted to lathi charge on them. At least 20 party workers were injured following the police lathi charge,” he added.Yashomati Thakur, the Guardian minister for Amravati district, said that the incident that has happened is unfortunate. Police will investigate it. Action will be taken against whoever is guilty. “Everyone has the right to protest but violence in the name of protest is not right. We appeal to the people to maintain peace. Some chaotic elements are working to spread violence in the city and police are working hard to maintain law and order,” she further said. The city police have detained around 50 people and are looking for others who are involved in the violence.Meanwhile, the leader of the Opposition and senior BJP leader, Devendra Fadnavis urged the state government to ensure law and order and condemned the violence that erupted on Friday in three towns, particularly, Amravati and Nanded.On the other hand, the chairman of the state Agriculture Mission and Shiv Sena leader Kishore Tiwari slammed the BJP for organising the counter-march in Amravati on Saturday that took a violent turn. The BJP is resorting to such “communal tactics” to polarise voters, eyeing the next year’s civic elections in Maharashtra as well as the 2022 elections in some states, including Uttar Pradesh, Tiwari alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/amravati-violence-situation-tense-but-under-control-says-senior-police-official-101636818470111.html

The government can make good policies, but its success depends on effective implementation. If some people in the police and administration try to derail it for petty gains, there is a problem,” he said.Kushwaha, a former union minister, also chided his party’s ally Bhartiya Janata Party for its comments. “BJP leaders issue statements just to appear different, which is not good. If there is any problem, they should discuss it at the proper forum,” he said.In the wake of several deaths in hooch incidents in different parts of the state this month, questions over poor implementation of prohibition in the state are being raised both from within the government as well as outside. BJP’s Bihar unit chief Dr Sanjay Jaiswal was also vocal in criticising the faulty implementation. “The situation is alarming in East Champaran, which is part of my constituency. Illicit liquor trade is going on with the collusion of the police. It has become part of the racket at many places to derail a law which was brought by Nitish Kumar with good intention. It calls for a serious review,” he said.While liquor flow has continued in the state despite Prohibition, it seems to have gone up sharply since the start of the ongoing panchayat polls. As per statistics of the police headquarters, 115,144 litres of liquor were recovered from the 10 districts which went to polls in the first phase, while the total recovery in the state stood at 4,43,785 litres during the period from August 24, when the panchayat polls were announced, to September 21, when campaigning for the first phase ended.Mounting case loadIn dry Bihar, pendency of liquor related cases in the already overburdened courts has been on the rise due to continued availability of liquor and frequent recoveries and arrests, including for alleged hooch tragedies. Since 2018, the share of such cases out of total institution of civil and criminal cases before the high court comes to around 19%, as per figures of the Patna High Court. During the pandemic year 2020, when the courts also had restricted functioning and fewer number of cases, the share of excise cases rose to 21.75%. Overall pendency has also risen due to pandemic disruptions. The impact on the subordinate courts is more, with the share of excise cases out of the total number of cases instituted being around 25.5%, say the official court figures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/prohibition-ahead-of-cm-s-review-meet-his-party-concedes-police-problem-101636818409877.html

State housing and urban development minister Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria said previously, the industrialists were required to obtain a CLU from the department and then required to get the building plans approved. “The process was quite cumbersome and time-consuming for the industrialists to start their projects. Exemption from obtaining CLU would encourage setting up of industries, due to the simplicity of the process,” the minister said, adding, “Now, industrialists can directly get their building plans approved from the department.” The approval of building plans, however, would be subject to the fulfilment of relevant guidelines for industries and building bye-laws of the department. The minister added that industrial associations, since long, were demanding that the process of setting up of industries be simplified and had been seeking single-step clearance. These associations had maintained there are many entrepreneurs, who wanted to establish industries in the state, but lengthy procedures for getting approvals, including CLUs, was discouraging them. “Considering the demand of industrial associations and in view of the changing scenario, where the state has to reduce its dependence on agriculture, and has to look for other avenues to boost economic growth, this decision has been made,” Sarkaria added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punjab-grants-exemption-from-clu-for-setting-up-stand-alone-industries-101636817930063.html

Air pollution can cause various ailments including breathing related problems, and can even harm vital organs like heart, lungs, eyes, skin and cause acute respiratory infections. To check air quality, UP Pollution Control Board has installed automated electronic devices at three places which include Jhunsi, Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology (MNNIT) and Prayagraj Municipal Corporation (PMC). The air quality index (AQI) at Jhunsi on Friday was at 324g/m3, at MNNIT 279g/m3 and at PMC 111g/m3, which were above the prescribed AQI standard of 50-100g/m3. As the air quality in the city is deteriorating, a number of medicos, officials of transport department and weather experts have recommended caution to the people. Former president of Allahabad Medical Association (AMA), Dr MK Madnani says, “Asthma is a respiratory disease caused by environmental pollution wherein the person feels difficulty in breathing, a feeling of pressure in the chest and cough, causing phlegm. These are caused from allergies.” Air pollution could also be dangerous for the eyes. Ophthalmologist Dr Kamaljeet Singh says, “Pollution affects the cells of the eyes, due to which the problem of dryness, redness and pain increases in the eyes. Due to the presence of elements like nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide and Sulphur dioxide in the polluted air, there is more damage to the eyes.” According to kidney specialist Dr Anurag Singh, Environmental pollution is extremely dangerous for the kidney. Heavy metals floating in the air and reaching the body through food get trapped in the kidneys. In recent times, the prevalence of kidney diseases has increased due to pollution. “If we start getting clean air and water, then not only the kidney gets benefitted but also the spread of diseases will get reduced,” he adds.Senior dermatologist of the city, Dr KG Singh says, “Pollution in the air is dangerous for the skin as this makes it lose its moisture and leads to various problems, including redness, rosacea and eczema. Due to this, fine lines, wrinkles and spots start appearing before time.” To cut air pollution from vehicles, transport office has also taken several initiatives. “Vehicles are being checked regularly but still lot of awareness has to be spread. People should participate in the workshops conducted by us and understand how they can save the environment. The department is continuously taking action in collaboration with the Pollution Control Board,” says regional transport officer (RTO), Prayagraj, RK Maurya. Regional environment officer RK Singh says, “Weather is also deteriorating air quality index in the city as lack of a bit strong winds (blowing at a speed of 10 to 15 kmph) has affected the AQI.” “However, the situation is now improving gradually as the incidents of stubble burning have come down in the district. We are also monitoring the constructions sites to check air pollution,” he says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/prayagraj-poor-air-quality-in-sangam-city-poses-health-threat-to-residents-101636817869907.html

The cash-strapped university’s internal audit department and finance wing had red-flagged five bills. On checking, the stamp and signatures of the department head were found to be forged and the names of research scholars and assistants against whom the bills were raised, turned out to be bogus. The university suspects that eight persons, including two varsity employees, were involved.Police have already arrested the main accused Nishu Chaudhary, a senior assistant with the university, on September 20 for siphoning money on the names of fake and dummy research scholars since 2016. According to preliminary police inquiry, Nishu had fraudulently and illegally distributed ₹60 lakh.Varsity vice-chancellor Arvind said, “I have spoken to the senior superintendent of police (SSP) for expediting investigation. The varsity’s internal committee report has already been submitted with the police. We want the case to be taken to its logical conclusion.”He added that it was important to go into the background of the case and identify as to how the nexus flourished for years altogether. “A team of district police met me recently and assured all help in cracking the case,” he added.Patiala SSP Harcharan Singh Bhullar said a special investigation team (SIT) under an SP-level officer has been formed for investigation into the case. “During investigation, we have zeroed in on the involvement of more individuals. The case has progressed well over the past few days. More arrests will follow soon,” he added.In August, a case was registered under Sections 420 (cheating), 406 (criminal breach of trust), 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant), 465 (for making forged documents), 467 (forgery), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged), 201 (tampering of evidence) and 381 (theft) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punjabi-university-wants-speedier-probe-into-may-fake-billing-scam-101636815889626.html

This area includes 32 villages (7 from the Panvel Tehsil of the Raigad district and 25 from the Uran tehsil).Sanjay Mukherjee, VC-MD, CIDCO, said, “After development plan is in place for Khopta New Town Notified area, it will have an excellent opportunity for growth and the area will be developed with state-of-the-art infrastructure and social facilities.”As the Special Planning Authority for the Khopta New Town Notified area, CIDCO had published the development plan for six villages (Barpada, Karnala-Tara, Dolghar, Kasarbhat, Dighati) on April 3, 2008. The Government of Maharashtra approved these development plans according to the Development Control Regulations on April 4, 2012 for the six villages.

13-11-2021||Mumbai||Cruise ship drugs bust case: Court observes seizure was illegal||While granting bail to 29-year-old Gurgaon resident Nupur Satija, an accused in the Cordelia cruise drugs bust case, a special Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS) court has observed that the seizure of contraband from her was illegal and under violation of section 42 of NDPS Act (Power of entry, search, seizure and arrest without warrant or authorisation). Special NDPS judge V V Patil had granted bail to Satija on October 30. However, the detailed order was made available recently. Satija’s counsel Ayaz Khan had argued that the search of Satija and her room at the cruise was carried out by a panch witness, who is not an empowered officer and therefore it is in breach of provisions of NDPS Act. There was no female officer present either. The NCB on October 2 checked room number 3603 at the cruise ship and found four green tablets purported to be Ecstasy kept in four sanitary pads, after which Satija was arrested. Special judge Patil also observed in the order that there is prima facie no conspiracy and abetment as alleged by the prosecution and hence section 29 of NDPS (criminal conspiracy and abetment) is not applicable. Hence section 37 of NDPS (offence to be cognisable and non bailable) would not apply. While giving bail to Satija, a resident of Gurgaon, and Gomit Chopra, a resident of New Delhi, the court said that the WhatsApp chats of both of them are regarding consumption of contraband and not regarding sale, purchase or any other use. While arguing for 29-year-old Satija’s bail, Khan had told the court she was found with four pills of Ecstasy weighing 1.59 grams in total, which was a non-commercial quantity and so Section 37 of NDPS Act would not be applicable. He had also argued that the panchnama was not carried out by an authorised officer prescribed under the act, hence the search and seizure was illegal. Moreover, she was arrested by a male officer, which is against the mandatory provisions of NDPS Act. The timing of the panchnama, which started at 19.40 hours and was completed at 21.50 hours i.e after sunset and before sunrise, which is also against the provisions of the Act. Satija and Chopra were arrested by the NCB on October 3 along with Aryan Khan while they were all headed to Goa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cruise-ship-drugs-bust-case-court-observes-seizure-was-illegal-101636814629688.html

While the area falls under the jurisdiction of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), the state tourism ministry is funding the development of the garden and Vadgaonsheri MLA Sunil Tingre is bringing this funding under the tourism development project with the help of minister of state for tourism, Aditi Tatkare.Tingre said, “Although this part falls under the PMC, we are getting the funds from the state government instead of using the civic body’s funds. This will be the first garden in the city being developed by the ministry of tourism. It is located on survey number 30/1 at Kharadi.”The plot is in the PMC’s possession and the work order is expected to be issued within a month after which actual work on the ground will begin, Tingre said. The garden’s layout and design have been finalised. It will house various attractions including an amphitheatre, meditation centre, play area, rose beds, a toilet and vertical gardens. To be named ‘Oxygen Park’, it will be one of the best gardens in the city, according to Tingre.The district administration on November 8 submitted a letter to the state government, asking the latter to transfer funds to begin work on the garden. Another proposal had also been submitted to the tourism ministry to develop a garden around the water body at Yerawada, with Tatkare giving in-principle approval and instructing that a detailed plan be prepared for the same.There are more than 200 PMC gardens in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/maharashtra-govt-to-fund-development-of-garden-at-kharadi-101636814030040.html

During the investigation, police found that an Audi car chased the ill-fated car but later occupants of the car told police that they escorted the car since some of the occupants were heavily drunk.Besides this, the CCTV visuals at the hotel in Kochi where they participated in a late-night party were also found to be missing. A senior police officer who is supervising the investigation said there are many loose ends and the explanations given by some of the participants at the party and the hotel owner were not convincing. Police have sealed the hotel but CCTV visuals of the party were found missing later. Police said they have given an ultimatum to the hotel management to produce visuals of the party area.Meanwhile, the driver of the car, A Rehman, who escaped with minor injuries, was arrested by the police for rash and negligent divining. Police also found that his versions were also contradictory and he was trying to hide something.“We have started questioning all those who participated in the late-night event and we will get a clear picture in a couple of days. It is true, there are many loose ends,” said the senior officer who did not want to be named. He said the driver is in judicial custody now and police will seek his custody later. Ansi Kabeer, a resident of Attingal in Thiruvananthapuram, was crowned Miss Kerala in 2019. Shajan, a runner up the same year was her close friend.

13-11-2021||Lucknow||Amit Shah says Hindi a friend of all indigenous languages||Union home minister Amit Shah on Saturday said Hindi is a friend of all indigenous languages and the country’s prosperity lies in the prosperity of all its languages.He was addressing the Akhil Bharatiya Rajbhasha Sammelan in Varanasi. This is the first time that the convention is taking place outside New Delhi. Shah appealed to the people to work for enriching the glorious heritage of country’s official language Hindi and other local languages.He said, “This is a year for the Hindi lovers to take a pledge that by the time we complete 100 years of Independence, indigenous languages and Rajbhasha (the official language Hindi) should become so strong that we do not need to take the help of a foreign language.”“Hindi is the friend (sakhee) of all indigenous languages (swabhasha). India’s prosperity lies in the prosperity of our Indian languages,” he said. He emphasised that there cannot be any ‘antarvirodh’ (differences) among friends.The home minister also said a sense of inferiority complex was instilled in the minds of some children who couldn’t speak English.Shah said it is his firm belief that the time is not far when those who cannot speak their mother tongue will have an inferiority complex.Asserting that there is a need to rid youths of the inferiority complex instilled during British rule, he said once the people of the country decide and its languages become the language of the governance, India will automatically get back the knowledge trove of Maharishi Patanjali and Panini. He appealed to people to speak to their children in “swabhasha”.“We need to create an environment wherein people take pride in speaking their mother tongue,” he said. The home minister also said efforts were made to create a lot of controversies around the Hindi language but that time is over now.“There is no contradiction between Hindi and all our local languages. My mother tongue is Gujarati. I love Hindi as much as I love Gujarati, l love Hindi a bit more than Gujarati,” Shah said. He also said the development of Indian languages is a central pillar of the National Education Policy and the syllabi of engineering and medical courses have been translated into eight Indian languages so far.Research can be done best in one’s own language, he said, adding that the root cause of our country’s backwardness is that the subjects of our studies and research were not in our languages. But the change made by PM Modi will change the future of India in the coming days, he said. Democracy can be successful only when the language of administration is “swabhasha” (own language), he stated.“Today, 100% work in the Ministry of Home Affairs is done in the official language (Hindi) and many departments are also moving in this direction,” he said.Shah lauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi for promoting Hindi across the world.“No Prime Minister has got so much of global accolades as much as Narendra Modi ji. He has put forth India’s point of view in the world in Rajbhasha (Hindi) and has enhanced the pride of the Rajbhasha,” he said.The official language (Hindi) should have been promoted soon after independence, because Swaraj, Swadeshi and Swabhasha were three main pillars of the freedom struggle, but this was not done, he said.“We got swaraj (Independence), but Swadeshi and Swabhasha were left behind,” he said. The country which loses its language country also loses its civilization, culture and its original thinking, he said. Countries that lose their original thinking cannot contribute to the progress of the world, he added.It is very important for everyone to preserve and nurture all the languages of India, he said.“India has the largest number of spoken script languages in the world. We have to take them forward,” he said. The stronger and richer the language, the more extensive and powerful the culture and civilization will be, he said. Shah said, “It is matter of joy for me that we have succeeded in taking the Rajbhasha Sammelan out of the lanes of Delhi. We had taken the decision to organise it outside Delhi in 2019 but it could not be done due to the global pandemic corona. Today, it is taking place in Kashi under the Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav.” Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav is being celebrated to mark 75 years of Independence.Shah, prior to his address, released a Hindi magazine at Akhil Bhartiya Rajbhasha Sammelan at Deendayal Hastkala Sankul in Varanasi. Ahead of the upcoming assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh, the Union home minister also held a review meeting with Vidhan Sabha in charges and district presidents of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Varanasi on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/amit-shah-says-hindi-a-friend-of-all-indigenous-languages-101636811269434.html

It has been already applied to other cities. Since the re-carpeting work of the runway is going on, we continued with the old schedule. There might be a possibility that we may get flights to a new destination. The schedule is not decided yet, tentatively it is expected to be decided on November 25,” said Santosh Dhoke, Pune airport director.Pune airport has already made new slots available and now it depends on airlines to increase connectivity to new destinations. Right now, Pune airport connects to 21 cities.“With a majority of people vaccinated against Covid, we are already witnessing heavy rush and the majority of pre-booking slots are booked. So, looking at the scenario, airlines may increase flights to destinations like Delhi, Jaipur and Chennai,” said another official from the Pune airport on the request of anonymity.IndiGo will be starting flights from Pune to Mumbai, Coimbatore, Bhubaneshwar and Guwahati from December 1.AirAsia India spokesperson said, “As Pune airport gears up for full-fledged operations from December 1, we plan to gradually increase our flights to and from Pune. Pune is an important node in our network and we are continuously looking to connect it with more and more destinations as and when the opportunities are available. Currently, we operate flights from Pune to Bhubaneswar, New Delhi, Jaipur, Kolkata and Bengaluru.”The passenger footfall, meanwhile, has increased since the airport restarted from October 30 after the shutdown of 14 days during October 14-29. During the month of September, per day footfall has touched the 10,000-mark. It went up to 15,000 in October and in the first 14 days of November, it crossed the 19,000-mark, as per the data provided by the Pune airport authority.“Generally, in the month of November, the flyer footfall increases. Diwali season is followed by Christmas and many opt for a winter vacation as well. Footfall will rise after the airport starts 24 hours operation,” said the official from the Pune airport quoted above.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-airport-authority-hopeful-of-operating-additional-flights-during-winter-schedule-101636811090182.html
13-11-2021||Mumbai||Thane Municipal Corporation increases testing for Covid post Diwali||Post-Diwali, the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) has increased Covid testing within the city. During the festive week, hardly 1,000 got tested but now the number of tests has increased to 3,000 and more on a daily basis.Ahead of Diwali as well, the number of tests was increased to 3,000 daily. “Although everything has opened up, there are fewer people coming forward for testing. We are approaching commuters and shopkeepers in market areas to get tested. During the festivities, there were hardly around 1,000 tests being conducted. This has increased now,” said Sandeep Malvi, additional commissioner, TMC.During the peak of the second wave, the overall positivity rate was 7.3%, until February, the positivity rate had gone below 2%. However, in the first week of October, the positivity rate continued to be stagnant at 2% to 2.5%. Now, it has gone lower than 2%. The low positivity rate is also a reason that the civic body is not focusing on increasing the number of tests within the city.“The positive cases continue to remain in control and so is the positivity rate. Our main focus is to vaccinate as many as possible before the onset of the probable third wave. As the situation is in control regarding the positive cases, we are not conducting any special drive for testing,” added Malvi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/thane-municipal-corporation-increases-testing-for-covid-post-diwali-101636810911551.html
13-11-2021||Mumbai||Thane civic body jabs 56K in 4 days of door-to-door vaccination drive against Covid||More than 20,000 people who had not even taken their single dose of Covid-19 vaccine were found and vaccinated in a door-to-door survey conducted in the last four days by the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC).Around 56,000 people were vaccinated in merely four days of the survey out of which 35% were those who had not taken a single dose.Post-Diwali, there were around 5.35 lakh residents in the city who had not taken a single dose of vaccination, as per the TMC.The vaccination centres continued to remain deserted with poor response across the city. Thus, the TMC initiated a door-to-door campaign to vaccinate as many as possible at the earliest. The door-to-door vaccination started on November 9 in every ward.Dr Prasad Patil, immunisation officer, TMC, said, “On a daily basis, there are around 14,000 getting vaccinated over the last four days. From among these, around 5,000 on a daily basis have been given the first shot. Through this door-to-door campaign, we are preparing a pendency list of those who have not taken the first jab yet.”A team of four in every ward is visiting homes in slums as well as high rises in order to get a figure as to how many have not been vaccinated at all.“In every ward, we have set up a team that visits each society or cluster of buildings to collect vaccination data. They also vaccinate those who are due to get their second dose,” added a senior civic officer.From among the 5.35 lakh residents who have not received a single jab of vaccination, TMC has managed to vaccinate 20,000 through door-to-door vaccination. The reluctance among the residents continues.“Mostly, people have been saying that they did not want to get vaccinated during the festive period. It is easier for those who have taken the first dose to get vaccinated but it takes some convincing for those who have not taken a single jab,” added a doctor who is a part of the team that conducts door-to-door vaccination.Areas like Mumbra and Rabodi, Lokmanya Nagar and Savarkar Nagar are some of the wards that have more number of people who have not taken the jab at all. Till now, TMC has vaccinated 19.30 lakh beneficiaries with at least the first dose. The city has a target of 18 lakh population. In order to reach out to more people who have not taken the first dose, various initiatives like withholding salaries of TMC employees who have not taken the jab and not permitting those who have not been vaccinated in TMT buses have been announced by the civic body.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/thane-civic-body-jabs-56k-in-4-days-of-door-to-door-vaccination-drive-against-covid-101636810069442.html
13-11-2021||Mumbai||Extortion case: Police ask court to declare Param Bir Singh ‘proclaimed absconder’||Mumbai crime branch officers moved an application to declare former city police commissioner Param Bir Singh as a ‘proclaimed absconder’ so that his properties could be seized. Singh, along with dismissed assistant inspector Sachin Vaze and others, is accused of extorting money from Goregaon businessman Bimal Agarwal. “On Saturday, we moved an application before a holiday court, seeking the initiation of procedure to get Singh and other wanted men, Riyaz Bhati and Vinay Singh alias Bablu, declared as a proclaimed accused under section 82 of Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). Once the court declares them proclaimed absconder, they would get a 30-days period to appear before the court. If they fail to appear, then their properties can be attached under sections 83 of CrPC. The holiday court has referred the plea to the regular court, which is likely to hear the matter on Monday,” said special public prosecutor Shekhar Jagtap. There are already three non-bailable warrants issued against Singh by different courts in Mumbai and Thane and five FIRs registered for various cases. A look-out circular (LoC) has been issued against Singh. Apart from this, two open inquiries have been initiated against the police officer by the state anti-corruption bureau (ACB) over the corruption allegations. Meanwhile, the holiday court also remanded Vaze in police custody for two days in the same extortion case. “We informed the court that we wish to question Vaze about the trail of money that was extorted from the complainant businessman. Hence, his further custody was required. The court was convinced and granted his two-day custody to crime branch officers,” said Jagtap. Vaze’s lawyer did not oppose to police’s plea to seek the extension of Vaze’s custody. His lawyer also informed the court that as there is too much pressure on Vaze from the Central and state governments, he is contemplating to give his statement before the magistrate under section 164 CrPC. The court asked the defence lawyer to make a decision about recording the statement and make the application before the regular court. Vaze was arrested in this case on November 1. The dismissed officer was previously arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in the Antilia explosives scare and Mansukh Hiran murder cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/extortion-case-against-param-bir-singh-sachin-vaze-remanded-in-2-day-police-custody-101636808749362.html

He reviewed the progress made by the port through its PPP initiatives and engaged with JNPT’s key stakeholders.JNPT officials briefed the minister about multiple initiatives undertaken by the Port to enhance Ease of Doing Business, including the recently-launched ‘Dwarf Container Train’ service and the status of Vadhavan Port and other JNPT-led infrastructure projects.During his visit, Sonowal said, “PPP-led synergies can transform and accelerate the country’s progress. With the majority of global trade carried by sea, ports are the gateway infrastructure that connects an entire region and its inland transportation network to the international market. Therefore, PPP at JNPT will help develop a strong, well-functioning maritime transport infrastructure, which is a key element of economic growth for the country. This initiative will become a means to manage port operations more effectively as well as to develop new port infrastructure, traditionally both exclusively government functions.“I am confident that through consistent tech advances and multimodal infrastructure development, JNPT will continue to navigate India’s port-led prosperity and anchor itself as a mega port by 2030.”Sanjay Sethi, chairman, JNPT, added that the minister’s visit provided an opportunity for the port stakeholders to share their perspectives on India’s growing maritime sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ppp-synergies-can-accelerate-growth-of-india-s-maritime-sector-says-minister-sonowal-during-visit-to-navi-mumbai-s-jnpt-101636807132546.html
13-11-2021||Kolkata||‘Mere rhetoric won’t do’: Congress’ Adhir Chowdhury asks Bengal CM Mamata to cut state taxes on fuel||Senior Congress leader and president of the West Bengal Congress Committee (WBCC) Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury wrote to Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Saturday, asking her to reduce taxes levied by the state on petroleum products. Chowdhury urged Mamata Banerjee to take “real and tangible actions” to help reduce fuel prices and said that “mere rhetoric and hollow sloganeering will not do.”The letter came amidst the already widening rift between the Congress and the Trinamool Congress (TMC) in the state even though both parties have supported a national front against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the Centre. Notably, the Congress and the TMC would also face off in the Goa state assembly elections, scheduled for early next year.In his letter, Chowdhury stated that all Congress-ruled states have slashed taxes on petroleum products as a respite to the “common man who is reeling under serious inflation and price rise.”Also read | 'Will also reduce VAT charged on fuel', Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot announcesAccording to a copy of the letter shared by news agency ANI, he said, “In view of the skyrocketing petroleum products, it has become very difficult for the common man to make both ends meet. Life has become a real struggle for them and because of this high price rise, it has become difficult to lead a decent and dignified life.”The Congress leader also claimed that while Banerjee raised the issue of high fuel prices several times, no “concrete” steps have been taken by the state government in reducing the costs. He also wondered why the prices have not been reduced in Bengal if it was done so in other states, where his party is in power. “The residents of West Bengal have been left high and dry,” he said.Urging the Bengal government to cut state taxes on petroleum products, Chowdhury said, “I appeal to you that you may please take concrete action on this issue and cut the State taxes so that the price of petroleum products in West Bengal comes down. This will have a multiplier effect and it will result in the overall reduction in price rise. Mere rhetoric and hollow sloganeering will not do. Please take real and tangible actions on the above matter.”Meanwhile, the BJP too has been protesting against the fuel prices in the state. On November 8, the party’s state unit warned of intensifying its protests if the Mamata Banerjee-led government does not reduce taxes in a week.“We are giving the state government an ultimatum of seven days... If it doesn't accept our demand, we will take out march to Nabanna to press for the same,” Bengal BJP chief Sukanta Majumdar said, news agency PTI reported.The Centre on November 3 cut excise duty on petrol by ₹5/litre and on diesel by ₹10/litre, following which several BJP-ruled states also reduced their VAT rates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/mere-rhetoric-won-t-do-congress-adhir-chowdhury-asks-bengal-cm-mamata-to-cut-state-taxes-on-fuel-101636805269674.html

The PCMC officials are conducting surveys in that area and a detailed project report (DPR) of the mother-and-child hospital will be presented before the general body next month.Sanjay Jagtap, city engineer of PCMC, said, “We will divide the said plot into two parts for developing the two hospitals. In the first phase, we will develop the mother-and-child hospital as there is no such dedicated hospital in this area. As per our plan, an eight-storied building will be developed for it and it will have around 150 beds. Besides, there will be operation theatres, OPD, vaccination centres, IVF centres and delivery rooms among others.Around 10% of the beds will be reserved for an ICU.Jagtap, however, did not say anything about the budget as the project has not been approved yet.“When this project will see some developments, we will start conducting surveys on the other half of the plot for developing a civic hospital. We have plans to develop a hospital similar to the one NMMC has in Vashi. However, it will be too early to say much about that at this moment,” he added.At present, PCMC has six health centres in Panvel town, New Panvel, Kamothe, Kalamboli and Kharghar. Those centres are, however, not enough to cater to the 8.50 lakh population of the city.Vinayaka Mane, 47, an activist from Panvel, said, “Due to the lack of health infrastructures, the residents of these areas are heavily dependent on the private hospitals. The economically weaker section is the one that is suffering the most.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/panvel-city-municipal-corporation-body-plans-mother-and-child-civic-hospitals-in-new-panvel-101636805631356.html
13-11-2021||Delhi||Rare case of post-dengue mucormycosis reported at Delhi hospital||A "rare" case of mucormycosis has been reported in a 49-year-old male patient at a leading private hospital here post his recovery from dengue, doctors said on Saturday.The case reported at the Apollo hospital in south Delhi comes amid a huge spike in the number of dengue cases in the national capital.According to a civic report on vector-borne diseases released on Monday, nine deaths and a total of 2,708 dengue cases have been recorded this season till November 6, which is the highest count since 2017 for the same period.Over 1,170 cases were logged in the first week of November.In a statement issued on Saturday, the Apollo hospital said, "A 49-year-old male has been reported to be one the rare cases of post-dengue mucormycosis by a team of doctors at the hospital."The patient had come to the hospital, complaining about a sudden loss of vision in one eye, 15 days after his recovery from the vector-borne disease.During the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic earlier this year, a large number of cases of the "black fungus" were reported throughout the country after the coronavirus infection was detected in patients suffering with chronic diabetes.Mucormycosis or the "black fungus" is more common among people whose immunity has got lowered due to Covid-19, diabetes, kidney disease, liver or cardiac disorders, age-related issues or those on medication for auto-immune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis.Mucormycosis post dengue is a new observation and hence, patients with a recent history of dengue should remain actively updated about their health and consult a healthcare expert immediately after noticing any new symptoms, doctors at the Apollo hospital said.Dr Suresh Singh Naruka, senior consultant (ENT), Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, who is leading the treatment of the patient, said, "A rare case of black fungus (mucormycosis) came into our view when the patient came to the hospital, reporting a sudden loss of vision in one eye post dengue fever. It is rarest of the rare to see mucormycosis as a post-recovery complication in a dengue patient as this condition is generally seen in people who have a history of diabetes, compromised immunity and various other infections.""It is a deadly infection caused by a group of fungus called mucor. This fungus invades into the healthy tissues of the nose, sinuses, eyes and brain so rapidly that any delay in diagnosis and management can lead to adverse long-term complications," he added.Dengue is accompanied with high fever and therefore, doctors feel that people might suspect that they have contracted Covid-19.The dengue mosquito larvae breed in clear, standing water, while those of malaria thrive even in dirty water.Dr Atul Ahuja, senior consultant (ENT and head and neck surgery) at the hospital, said, "Diagnosing and managing a case of rhino-orbital (involving nose and eye) mucormycosis in a patient who has just recovered from dengue fever is very important, as even after best treatment, patients of mucormycosis can lose their eyesight permanently and in a state of an aggressive infection, removal of eye becomes necessary for preventing any further spread of infection."Dr Nishant Rana, registrar at the facility, said, "Before coming to the hospital, the patient had an episode of nasal bleeding as a complication owing to dengue 15 days prior to his recovery, wherein he noted a low count of platelets with no transfusion history. Mucormycosis in his case is a resultant factor of compromised immunity owing to dengue."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/rare-case-of-post-dengue-mucormycosis-reported-at-delhi-hospital-101636804804245.html

13-11-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt starts process to suspend Param Bir Singh over extortion cases||The Maharashtra government has initiated the process to suspend former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh and another police officer after they were named as accused in extortion cases, an official said on Saturday. The process began after a proposal was sent by the Director General of Police (DGP) to the state home department a few days ago, he said. In September, DGP Sanjay Pandey had sent a proposal to suspend Singh and other police officials named in alleged extortion cases, but the home department sought specific information about the role of each accused officer. The DGP's office sent a fresh proposal this week, the home department official said. The department is considering the suspension of Param Bir Singh and a Deputy Commissioner of Police-rank officer who is named in these cases, but not others, he added. On Wednesday, a magistrate's court issued a non-bailable warrant (NBW) against Singh in an extortion case registered at Marine Drive police station here by real estate developer Shyamsunder Agrawal. It was the third NBW issued against Singh. Earlier courts had issued warrants in cases of extortion registered at Goregaon in Mumbai and in neighbouring Thane against him. The IPS officer was shunted out from the post of Mumbai police commissioner in March this year after assistant police inspector Sachin Waze (now dismissed) was arrested in the case of the SUV with explosives found near industrialist Mukesh Ambani's south Mumbai house, and subsequent death of businessman Mansukh Hiran. Singh subsequently accused then state home minister Anil Deshmukh of asking police officials to collect ₹100 crore a month from bars and restaurants in Mumbai. Deshmukh, who denied the allegation, stepped down as minister and is facing CBI probe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-govt-starts-process-to-suspend-param-bir-singh-over-extortion-cases-101636802045456.html

Also read: India strongly takes up ‘Khalistan’ referendum with UKIn her first press conference since joining as the Punjab frontier IG in July, Mishra said that the BSF’s jurisdiction was mandated after its formation in 1966 and under certain Acts, including passport, NDPS, customs, arms and provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code. BSF not a policing organisation “There is only change in the schedule, not in the laws over the jurisdiction, which has been extended. We always coordinate with police and other agencies for national security and in the interest of the country. The BSF is not a policing organisation. As a result, the BSF does not have the mandate to register first information reports (FIRs). After the search or seizure, we hand over the accused to the police or other law-enforcement agencies to take the investigation to its logical conclusion,” Mishra said. So the power of the police remains the same. The BSF is only to complement, assist and strengthen the police and other agencies by working with them jointly,” she said. Drone intrusions biggest challenge The IG termed the drone intrusions the biggest challenge on the border and said that the BSF has developed new technologies to overcome the challenge. “We have been encountering drones since 2017. Earlier, the drones entered up to 1.5km at a low height but now drones intrude deeper due to better technology. 370-kg drugs, 55 weapons seized this year Mishra said that the BSF has seized about 370kg of drugs, mainly heroin, 55 weapons and killed six Pakistani infiltrators so far this year. She said the Union government has given ₹35 crore as compensation to farmers of the border belt for 2015-17 and sanctioned ₹35 crore as relief from 2018-21 that will be distributed soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/only-extent-of-jurisdiction-has-changed-not-laws-bsf-punjab-frontier-ig-101636801369561.html

The civic officials have claimed that the jumbo facility at Avalon Parking Plaza and the Covid Care Centre, however, will be operational.The city, at present, has around 380 active cases with a caseload of 35 to 50 cases on a daily basis. The recovery rate is 98.25% while the growth rate of the last one week is 0.03%. The corporation has claimed that there are hardly any patients admitted to these two Covid hospitals and if and when the third wave demands additional facilities, these can be easily set up as the entire mechanism is in place.Manish Joshi, deputy municipal commissioner, said, “There are merely 20 patients in the 1,076-bed Thane Global Hospital while four are admitted at the Kausa Hospital, which has a capacity of 450 beds. At present, the operational cost of these hospitals is ₹5.5Cr per month. We are closing these facilities. However, the 1,000-bed facility at Parking Plaza will be operational along with the one at Bhayander Pada.”Thane Global Hospital was set up during the first wave in June 2020. More than 15,000 people have been treated at this hospital while more than 94,000 vaccinations were administered from this hospital.The corporation has also added a paediatric ward at the Parking facility. Joshi claimed that they are ready for the third wave with all the machinery in place. He added, “In the second wave, we had 53 metric tons of oxygen availability per day, which is three times at present for the third wave. The beds are also in abundance compared to the present requirement and more can be added when there is a demand.”The proposal will be tabled in the general body meeting to be held on November 18.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/thane-civic-body-proposes-to-shut-2-covid-facilities-for-paucity-of-patients-101636800829408.html
13-11-2021||Pune||Startup Mantra: Electrifying the mobility market to keep business in the green||Fuelled by a passion to do something different, Sanchek Pilane, a mechanical engineering student in his 20s, founded his startup Exa Mobility in 2018 with the long-term vision of “Mobility-as-a-Service” (MaaS). Little did he know that two years of hard work in research and development was not enough to “convince” investors in the electric vehicle (EV) space. Then, the Covid-19 outbreak and subsequent lockdowns came. An undeterred Pilane followed his dreams, pivoted his business model and is now cash-flow positive.In the beginning… A student of Jnana Prabodhini, Pilane did his mechanical engineering from the Pune Vidhyarthi Griha’s College of Engineering and Technology. Says Pilane, “I wanted to do something different. In my school days, I dreamt of becoming a scientist, but while pursuing my engineering degree I thought of entrepreneurship and decided to enter this exciting space.”“I had developed a keen interest in sustainable energy. While we were in the third year of engineering, our college team participated in an electric vehicle competition. We had then made a running prototype of an electric bike. I was the vice-captain of the team and we had won that competition. Since ours was the first team to participate in such an event, there was no team to guide us. In another national-level competition by Mahindra, we came in the top 10. I realised that that EV is the future. That’s when I decided to do venture into the EV Space,” recalls Pilane. Starting upAfter finishing his engineering education in 2017, Pilane’s family wanted him to go abroad for higher education, gain experience and then start a business. However, Pilane felt that would be a waste of time. “Instead of investing a couple of years and spending lakhs of rupees for higher education abroad, I thought I will gain more experience with my startup in India. My expertise was in product development and I wanted to utilise it since my college competition days. My family too trusted me and supported me. Today I can say my decision has been proved right,” Pilane says.A rough rideSays Pilane, “Exa Mobility was started in June 2018. The first electric scooter prototype was prepared in March 2019. We wanted to develop a product which is useful for our business. Hence, we were designing our product for logistical commercial fleets and not for regular consumers.” Building the team was the first challenge that Pilane faced. He says, “My college friend was my first employee, but after a few months he left to pursue his higher education. We faced a lot of problems during recruitment. Neither did we have a strong business background nor had we any IIT-tag. Convincing candidates and hiring them was tough. We hired our second employee in August 2019. During the first prototype phase, we were a team of four.”Covid hitsExa Mobility participated in the College of Engineering Pune (COEP) Startup Fest in February 2020. “The response from investors was good and the team was in the top 10. We expected to raise a funding of ₹30 lakh to ₹1 crore. However, investors felt that we needed to generate more traction and also develop the prototype further. They asked us to have at least 50 vehicles running on the road. We were disappointed, but determined to make it happen. However, after that, the Covid-19 outbreak happened and whatever investor interest we had generated was lost,” Pilane said. “We were clueless about the pandemic and its after-effects. We didn’t anticipate the lockdown to go on for months. From April to August 2020, we kept on hiring candidates. Our second prototype with increased range and a more aerodynamic design was ready. However, by then, we had started to face a financial crunch. So, we started laying off employees till December 2020, after which, the team stabilised,” Pilane claims. The pivotRelying heavily on research and development of product and losing focus on the business part made Pilane learned his lessons the hard way. Trying to figure out a way to gather revenues, Pilane and his team started a rental service for EV bikes. “We made an app called Exa Ride for shared mobility services to generate revenues for the company. We had the IT crowd as our target audience, but during the second wave we took another hit on this side. I was so disappointed that I was thinking of closing down the company at that time. Luckily through a vendor contact, Pilane got an order from an e-commerce company for seven EV vehicles for their logistics and delivery services. In this turn of fortune, Exa Mobility started receiving other orders and we had about 80 vehicles running on road on a rental basis in the month of May this year,” Pilane stated. Mobility as a ServiceSays Pilane: “We created the ‘Mobility as a Service’ platform to radically change the way people and goods move from one point to another. We aim to provide a next-gen urban commute system and our shared electric vehicles will become an integral part of your world. Our vision is system-level integration of sustainable mobility into the transportation system.”“We are also filing multiple patents for the vehicle. We are building an entirely new product. We were recently selected by Software Technology Parks of India (STPI) under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology to be incubated at the ‘MOTION’ – a Centre of Entrepreneurship (CoE) in Autonomous, Connected, Electric, Shared (ACES) Mobility. MOTION is a specialised state-of-the-art incubation facility and domain specific physical laboratories for start-ups working in the area of Autonomous Connected Electric Shared Mobility where the highest-standards and best-practices in terms of infrastructure, technology, leadership, mentoring, training, research and development, funding, networking for the given focus area is made available.Business USPPilane and his team came up with an interesting business model. Exa Mobility rents out electric vehicles to its B2B customers but they own only 20 vehicles of the total fleet of 90. The rest are financed by “investors”. These investors can be any individual who is willing to fund the purchase of EVs and get a good return on investment. “We do digital marketing to approach ‘investors’ for financing. We got our first investor in May 2021 who owns a mobile shop and got in touch with us through our advertisement. For example, for a vehicle worth ₹70,000, the investor is paid ₹2,700 per month for the first three years. Ownership of the vehicle is with the investor as collateral against his funds. With about 21 per cent compounding return on investment, the individual gets ₹1.24 lakh in three years and thereafter, ownership is transferred to Exa Mobility,” Pilane explains.“We have managed to get 55 vehicles financed through this business model and it is working quite well for us. At present the vehicles purchased for the rental model are from different companies like Hero Electric, BATTRE (Delhi) and PureEV (Hyderabad), depending on their offerings for different customer segments. With this unique business proposition, we get Rs4,000 per month on rental models, which also includes maintenance and other charges of the financed vehicle. We are profitable from day 1,” Pilane claims.“We were in talks with some colleges, but haven’t deployed any vehicles on those campuses yet. According to this proposal, colleges would give us parking space, charging infrastructure in their campus and their students or staff can use our vehicles for internal or external use. Bharati Vidyapeeth college students used our vehicles on an hourly basis for a charge of ₹250 per hour. In a way they were our first customers which we got through the Exa Ride app. But now, we are only catering to B2B customers on the basis of a monthly charge of ₹4,000 to Rs5,000. Strong KYC is a mustSays Pilane, “In order to mitigate risks involved in the rental model of EVs, we have put in place a very strong Know Your Customer (KYC) process. In case of individuals, we charge ₹400 per day. We take the Aadhar number of the user which is then verified from a database. A selfie and photo of the user with vehicle is also taken. Recently we have started securing a deposit of ₹4,000 per vehicle. All our vehicles are insured and in case of accident, the insurance claim can be made. If any expenses over and above the approved insurance amount are incurred, it is recovered from the user.”Expansion and future plansWhen asked about his expansion and future plans, Pilane says he aims to have 1,000 vehicles on the road on a rental basis by March 2022. “In the logistics segment alone, we are targeting 1,000 vehicles. Pune itself has an immediate demand of 500 EVs for B2B segment. We want to explore the $220 billion industry in logistics by providing end-to-end logistics service. Recently, we started operations in Navi Mumbai and plan to expand in Mumbai, Thane, Nashik and Goa in the next one year. We haven’t yet tapped the IT industry and student customer segment.”“We would like to associate with the Pune Metro for exploring the first mile and last mile connectivity. This would be after six more months as it would be an operations heavy model with requirement of sizeable human resources. About two years later, we will launch our own product and we would need around ₹50 to ₹100 crore to setup a factory for production of our vehicles. In the long term we wish to enter the autonomous vehicles space in 2030. There is lot of scope in the trucking industry in this particular space,” states Pilane. What to do when... In April 2021, when the second lockdown happened, an electric scooter was “almost” stolen. Just before the lockdown, a customer exhausted the battery. So he decided to park it at his relative’s shop. “We told him that we will take it from there as soon as possible and asked him to make sure that vehicle is put to charge. But he forgot to charge it and the lockdown was announced next day so even we couldn’t go near the vehicle for a few days. Just to make sure vehicle is safe, we monitored it via GPS. Once our team went there, the vehicle was not there,” says PIlane.“We enquired and people said that they never saw any electric scooter there. We were clear that something was fishy. We coordinated with the local police station. We informed everyone that police are coming and if anyone knows about our vehicle, now is the time to talk. So, within 15 minutes , one person said that he hid the vehicle so that it won’t be stolen by anyone and showed us where the bike was. We recovered our bike. Thereafter, we mostly prefer monthly subscription plans with strict KYC of the customer. Also, we are doing regular visits and GPS tracking of the vehicles,” Pilane claims.Money talks“I run a food joint business and also work as a Facility Manager in an IT company based in Pune. The biggest reason for me to invest here was a massive 24 per cent return. The fact that they provide a fixed monthly payment made me curious about the programme. So far I have financed 5 e-scooters and that makes my fixed income per month ₹13,500 which is quite exceptional. I am going to be the owner of the e-scooters that I have financed. So, this makes my investment backed back a strong asset,” says Vernon Cardozo, an investor,“Being a retired person, my first choice was always a fixed deposits in the Bank. They are safe and most trustworthy. I wanted few of my savings to be invested somewhere else for higher returns as FD is nowadays giving only 6% returns. I invested in Exa Mobility’s Vehicle Financing Programme as the returns were guaranteed with monthly instalments and I always admire youngsters doing something futuristic and innovative,” said Anil Bibikar, a retired professor“I have been a regular customer of Exa Ride’s daily rental plan. I think it is a good alternative to the round trip of Ola or Uber Cab and especially when you want to visit multiple places in the city,” says Deepa Bargi, a working professional.The competition: eleRide renting EVs in PuneeleRide has launched monthly subscription plans for electric two-wheelers in Pune. Users can access the smart charging centers facility along with free insurance and maintenance and a detachable battery chargeable at home. Using these electric two-wheelers, any user can travel up to 100 km on a single charge. This service is available for both B2C and B2B customers.The company has introduced two new subscription plans ranging between ₹3,499 to ₹4,499 under eleLite and elePrime with the introduction of five charging stations and three eleRide EV service centres across Pune at locations like Shivajinagar, Viman nagar, Vishrantwadi, Wakad and Pashan (Bengaluru-Mumbai Highway). Punekars can choose their preferred two-wheelers along with the subscription term through the eleRide website and get it delivered to their doorstep in two hours.“We believe that two-wheelers will lead India’s transition to e-mobility. We will accelerate this shift by providing smarter ownership options to customers. We aim to expand the eco-friendly two-wheeler subscription services across the country starting with cities like Mumbai, Hyderabad and Bengaluru,” said Niraj Kumar Mishra, Founder and CEO eleRide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/startup-mantra-electrifying-the-mobility-market-to-keep-business-in-the-green-101636800713258.html

The environmental programme was launched in 2019 with the state cabinet approving ₹24,524 crore for its implementation over the next three years.Jha said that intra-linking of small rivers within Bihar would help mitigate flood and drought. “Bihar is happy with the progress being made by the National Water Development Agency (NWDA) in drafting of a detailed project report (DPR) for interlinking of state’s rivers. This will contribute significantly in mitigating the double whammy of flood and drought, which the state faces every year,” he added.He urged the Centre to provide financial aid on the formula of 90:10, for the Koshi Mechi Intra State River Linking Project as the scheme would be of immense benefit to four districts of eastern Bihar.Also Read | Bihar panchayat election 2021 results: Know who is winning from whereHe thanked the national agency for agreeing to reconsider the feasibility of Bagmati-Ganga link, Budhi Gandak -Noon-Baya-Ganga link and Bagmati Budhi Gandak link projects under intra-state river linking schemes.He said the mathematical modelling centre of Bihar was undertaking model study for intra-linking of various rivers in Bihar. “Recent model study done for interlinking of Bagmati-Ganga link has shown positive results. If the scheme is implemented, it will help free Kusheshwarsthan of flood menace caused by Bagmati, Kamala and Kosi rivers,” he said, adding interlink Bagmati, Koshi & Kamala river basin of north Bihar and Punpun, Harohar basins of south Bihar would go a long way in mitigating flood and drought situationsJha said that CM Nitish Kumar had been keen on interlinking of small rivers for water conservation and irrigation facilities benefitting farmers, besides working on mission mode to face the climate challenge.

13-11-2021||Patna||Bihar’s air quality improves to ‘moderate’, winter delayed||Air quality in Bihar improved to ‘moderate’ level on Friday, after remaining in the ‘poor’ category for a week after Diwali, said officials of the Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB). According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Patna’s 24-hour overall air quality index (AQI) based on five monitoring stations stood at 172 which was classified as ‘moderate’.Of the monitoring stations, Rajbansi Nagar and Samanpura recorded a maximum value of 205 and 255 respectively while Muradpur, Danapur and Shikarpur recorded maximum value ranging between 130 to 140. All these stations recorded PM2.5 and PM10 as major pollutants.The CPCB classifies an AQI of zero to 50 as ‘good’, 51-100 as ‘satisfactory’, 101-200 as ‘moderate’, 201-300 as ‘poor’, 301-400 as ‘very poor’ and above 401 as ‘severe’. Apart from the state capital, other three prominent cities also recorded ‘moderate’ air quality with the AQI at Muzaffarpur at 196, Hajipur at 135 and Gaya at 117.BSPCB’s chairman Ashok Ghosh attributed favourable meteorological condition for improvement in the air quality.“Weather transition is slow in the state in comparison to the north region. Air quality tends to deteriorate in winter season with fall in temperature and low wind speed which obstructs dispersal of pollutants”, he added.Meanwhile, Patna Meteorological Centre has forecasted delay in winter onset this year. Usually, winter season begins in the state on November 10.Also Read | Bihar panchayat election 2021 results: Know who is winning from whereWeathermen said a dip in maximum and minimum temperature has been seen but no major change in temperature is likely in a couple of weeks.As per MeT centre, Patna recorded a maximum temperature of 30°C while a minimum temperature of 17.6°C, a dip of 2 degrees than the season’s normal.

13-11-2021||Delhi||What are markets without street vendors, ask Delhiites||New DelhiImagine entering Sarojini or any other popular market in Delhi, and not finding vendors and hawkers selling affordable clothes, trinkets and lip-smacking street food. With the Delhi High Court stressing on the need to have organised vending activities in markets in the Capital, shoppers hope street vendors will not be asked to leave altogether. Suggesting registration of street vendors and designated zones for them, shoppers in Delhi iterate that markets would lose their charm sans vendors.“Not everybody can afford showrooms; half of the city dwellers are dependant on cheap buys. It’s about their livelihood. There should be better cleanliness, though,” opines Mayank Negi, a graphic designer residing in Laxmi Nagar. Echoing a similar sentiment is Yogesh Verma, a real estate agent from Pitampura. He says, “Street vendors are really the heart and soul of any market. My wife and I love shopping from them. In fact, at times, I have shopped more from them than big showrooms. But yes, it won’t be such a bad thing to have a separate space for them. I hope small sellers are not completely evicted.”At a time when street hawkers are struggling to make ends meet, many urge for better communication between vendors and town vending committees (TVCs). Patel Nagar-based Mayanka Plaha, who works in a bank, says: “Vendors are afraid of committees and start running when they come. Last year was hard for them, they have just resumed business. At this point, I hope a system is put in place.”When purchasing items sold by street vendors, bargaining is an option, thereby making shopping a little less heavy on the pocket. Gaurav Kumar, a resident of Rani Bagh, opines: “Street vendors have good products available at reasonable prices. I will be disappointed if I don’t see them (in markets). Street vendors are the beauty of Delhi’s markets. My friends and I always shop for belts, caps, glasses, socks etc. from these small sellers, as I don’t like to buy these items from a big shop.”Author tweets @siddhijainnFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/what-are-markets-without-street-vendors-ask-delhiites-101636797116572.html

Today (on Friday), officials informed me that the governor’s office has handed over the report to the state government... in the meantime, the state government has appointed two new members to the commission to complete the probe,” Baghel said. The chief minister was responding to media questions at Raipur airport on Friday evening, after returning from Delhi. Asked whether the report submitted by the panel headed by Mishra will be made public, Baghel said, “Absolutely not, since the report is incomplete... The commission’s secretary had written to the General Administration Department that the probe was incomplete.” On Thursday, the Chhattisgarh government appointed a new chairman, added another member to the enquiry commission and added new terms of reference. The commission, which was earlier headed by former Chhattisgarh High Court judge Prashant Kumar Mishra, was constituted on May 28, 2013, by the then BJP government, submitted its findings to the Chhattisgarh Governor Anusiya Uike on November 6, after which Congress raised objections that it should be submitted to the state government and not to the governor. “The commission was constituted during the Raman Singh government in 2013 and its term was extended for 20 times. In June this year, the panel’s tenure was extended for the last time and in September, the commission’s secretary had sought a further extension, saying the probe was yet to be completed. Meanwhile, Justice Prashant Mishra was transferred as Chief Justice of Andhra Pradesh High Court. In such a situation, I sought the opinion of the law department, “ Baghel said. On May 25, 2013, Maoists attacked a convoy of Congress leaders during the party’s`Parivartan Rally’ in the Jhiram valley in Bastar district of Chhattisgarh killing 29 people including then state Congress chief Nand Kumar Patel, former leader of opposition Mahendra Karma and former Union minister VC Shukla. The new order appoints Justice (retired) Satish K Agnihotri, former Chief Justice of Sikkim High Court, as the new chairman of the commission and Justice (retired) G Minhajuddin as a member. Both of them have served tenures as judges in Chhattisgarh High Court. Earlier this week, the Chhattisgarh Congress, including Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel, raised objections over the submission of the report to the Governor and pointed out that in September, the commission had sought extension of the term, asking why then it was submitted in a hurry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/judicial-commission-report-on-jhiram-valley-attack-won-t-be-made-public-as-it-s-incomplete-bhupesh-baghel-101636794710644.html

Shah, who will leave for Azamgarh from Varanasi, also praised right wing ideologue Vinayak Damodar Savarkar for what he described as the latter's efforts towards promotion of the language.“Time has come to take pride in speaking Hindi,” the Union home minister said, adding that parents should talk to children in their native tongue as ‘original thoughts come from our own language.’ The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader further said that the ‘inferiority complex’ regarding Hindi, which came up during the British rule, should be brought to an end.He also said that the country ‘lagged behind’ because researches are conducted in foreign language. “However, the new National Education Policy lays emphasis on official language and regional language. Also, history of every state should be translated into official language,” Shah said.Vinayak Damodar ‘Veer’ Savarkar, Shah said, is known in the country for his works, and respected for the promotion of the Hindi language. The home minister's visit to the politically significant Uttar Pradesh comes as the ruling BJP prepares for next year's assembly elections in the state, likely to be held in February-March.

13-11-2021||Delhi||Curb on calls after work: not possible in india, say denizens||Picture this. You’ve logged off for the day, plan to step out for a meal and just then, your boss asks you to attend an urgent meeting. Seems familiar? To make up for this loss of work-life balance, Portugal has reportedly introduced a new law that makes it illegal for bosses to contact their employees after work hours. And professionals back home are in total support of such measures, but feel it cannot be put into action here. “I don’t think the work environment in India supports this culture at all. I am always getting calls from work after I log off, and I end up working all the time. Our legal contract says 8.5 hours a day, but that is not the case,” says Siddharth Roy, an advertising professional from Rohini.Ireland also has a similar policy which speaks about the “right to disconnect” wherein employers are asked to use pop up messages to remind people that they don’t have to reply to work emails after working hours. There are similar rules in the UK, Germany and France as well. Work from home has made it worse, agrees Esha Gill, a Product Manager from Patparganj, adding,”The working hour concept is gone from my dictionary ever since I have started working from home. How I miss saying that I have left office to those after hours work calls. Now every call I get after 7 is super urgent and to be closed then only. After work kahin jaane ka option hi nahi raha.”Going out after work is seldom possible in such a situation. And on days one manages to chalk out time to step out, they’re often found attending calls from wherever they are. “In my previous firm, when I’d finish work and go out to a lounge or restaurant, I would perpetually be running to the washroom to answer calls. Especially during WFH, work never ends,” rues Yuvraaj Singh, an operations executive from Surajmal Vihar..For companies that deal with clients based out of countries across the world, time zone is a challenge when considering implementing such measures, feels Kunal Mathur, director of an MNC in Gurugram. “We are catering to clients from all over the world, issues can happen anytime. We need to answer to the client in case we miss something, so things need to be in place. But as a policy, if all goes well, I do not disturb my team once they log off for the day,” he adds. Dr Imran Noorani, consultant chief psychologist at a Delhi hospital, asserts one must divide time for personal, professional commitments. “We need to segregate time for work and personal life, else anxiety and stress creeps in, and performance dips. In the long term, this will be a loss for an organisation,” he adds.

Her in laws claimed it to be a case of death by suicide but her parents and those in their support alleged she was murdered by the in-laws and demanded arrest of the guilty.Activists from Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Yuva Morcha reached the spot and later also gathered at Shahganj police station in Agra demanding action against the woman’s in-laws. The situation at Shahganj was brought under control by police who reached the spot after first reports of tensions were reported.Yogendra Upadhyay and Ram Pratap Singh Chauhan, BJP MLAs from Agra South and Etmadpur respectively, too reached Shahganj police station in the night demanding action alleging the woman was murdered.“The matter relates to the death of a woman from one religion who had married a man from another religion. ...it was claimed by her in laws that it was a case of suicide by hanging. The body was brought down and police reached the spot,” stated Agra’s senior superintendent of police (SSP) Sudhir Kumar Singh.Also Read | UP polls: BJP favourite, SP gains momentum, shows ABP-CVoter surveySingh added that additional force was called from another police station to ensure the situation doesn’t go out of hand. “Clashes were averted and fair investigation will be undertaken in the matter. We will hear the complainant and necessary action will be taken,” he said.“We got information through the phone about the death of our daughter and we demand action against those involved in her killing,” stated the woman’s mother.Heavy police force beside PAC was deployed at Shahganj area in Agra on Saturday morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/tension-in-agra-over-death-of-woman-in-inter-faith-marriage-101636781687914.html

13-11-2021||Delhi||As Delhi pollution nears emergency level, CPCB advises people to skip outdoors, cut vehicle use||As the air quality level in Delhi plunged to near emergency levels, the pollution controlling authorities have asked people in the national capital to limit outdoor activities and told government and private offices to cut vehicle use by at least 30 per cent. The air quality index (AQI) in Delhi was 471, according to the Central Pollution Control Board's (CPCB) 4pm bulletin on Friday, the worst this season so far. It was 411 on Thursday.Also Read | Among world's 10 most polluted cities, 3 are from IndiaA record number of farm fires are among the major reasons for pushing up Delhi's pollution on Friday.A sub-committee on Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) said meteorological conditions will be highly unfavourable for dispersion of pollutants till November 18 and agencies concerned must be fully ready to implement measures under "emergency" category.After warning, parents have begun keeping their children at home as the days remain particularly dangerous for those with respiratory conditions.“This spike in pollution is an amalgamation of many things. Delhi already saw peak pollution levels after Diwali and the high stubble count in Punjab and Haryana. Because of slow winds, the pollution load is not being eased, and more pollution is being added. All this is being recirculated in the air,” said VK Soni, head of IMD’s environment and research department.According to an analysis of data from heat-sensing satellites done by Hindustan Times, there have been 24,694 incidents of fire recorded since November 8. This number is the highest for the second week of November since 2012, the earliest year for which data was available.Also Read| Air trap around Delhi may stay for a weekThe CPCB said the 24-hour average concentration of lung-damaging fine particles known as PM2.5 in Delhi-NCR crossed the 300 mark around midnight and stood at 381 micrograms per cubic metre at 4pm on Friday, over six times the safe limit of 60 micrograms per cubic metre.The PM10 level was recorded at 577 micrograms per cubic metre, over five times the safe limit of 100 micrograms per cubic metre.According to Grap, the air quality is considered to be in the 'emergency' category if the PM2.5 and PM10 levels continue to be above 300 micrograms per cubic metre and 500 micrograms per cubic metre respectively for 48 hours or more. The emergency-level curbs include measures like ban on construction work and entry of heavy vehicles, and odd-even car use limits.A layer of eye-stinging smog lingering over Delhi-NCR thickened on Friday, giving an orange tint to the sun and lowering visibility to 200 metres at several places in the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/as-delhi-pollution-nears-emergency-level-cpcb-says-don-t-go-outside-101636773554730.html
13-11-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: The other Chandni Chowk||These days people are composing new ballads for Chandni Chowk. The refurbished avenue has become more pedestrian-friendly for the Walled City aficionados. The change is believed to have accentuated the enjoyment of the district’s signature pleasures—the shops and eateries, the havelis and shrines, the idyllic view of the Red Fort on one side, and of the Fatehpuri Masjid on the facing side.You’ll be surprised to discover that there’s another Chandni Chowk in Old Delhi. It is not called by this name, but the resemblance is like of a conjoined twin. Here also are very many shops. This too is very pedestrian-friendly (since a long time!). The signature pleasures include a view of the Red Fort on one side, and of Delhi’s greatest mosque on the facing side.The Meena Bazar extends from Netaji Marg to the Jama Masjid (gate no. 2). It skirts past the garden-mausoleum of freedom fighter Maulana Abul Kalam Azad. The market bustles with a smorgasbord of distractions, diverse enough to give Chandni Chowk an inferiority complex. Consider the stuff on display in the pavement stalls today—jackets, coconuts, towels, wrist watches, chhole bhature, shawls, shoes, overcoats, camera chips, skirts, leggings, haleem, mobile phone screen protections, hats, dolls, laptop chargers, leather belts, peanut chikkis, suits, teddy bears, scarves, computer mouses, biryani, bed sheets, ear danglers, old coins, cassette recorders, channa jor garam, perfumes, machine ka thanda pani, ear phones, cotton candy, wigs… an exhaustive list might fill up at least half the page of this paper.The bazaar also happens to be the only location in Old Delhi that showcases the frontal prospect of the Jama Masjid; this is the only side of the 17th century monument unencumbered by Walled City’s chaotic architecture. This market lane was the official route of the Mughal emperors to stage a royal procession from their residence in the Red Fort to the Jama Masjid. The area was then known as Khas Bazar, and in ordinary days it would teem with jugglers, dancers and magicians strutting their skills to the awestruck travellers.This evening the lane is crowded with shoppers trying out sweater/jacket/sandal, etc. The red sandstone mosque is shrouded in winter smog, and appears grainy as if it were an apparition of golden dust. Even so, one can clearly identify the sweeping staircase, the doorway, the minarets, the dome, and the pigeons flying about the dome. Soon the sun starts to set behind the mosque. While a half-moon surfaces in another part of the sky.Chandni Chowk’s name suggests that it glows with moonlight. Any nighttime visitor there will tell you that this is factually incorrect. But the bazaar here does glow in a full moon night. May be it is a truer Chandni Chowk.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-other-chandni-chowk-101636767766748.html
13-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi sees 2 deaths as Covid cases rise||With 62 new infections of the coronavirus disease reported in Delhi on Friday, the highest in 79 days, new cases of Covid-19 appear to have again started rising in the Capital, data shows, suggesting that the seven-month-long contraction of the outbreak in the city may be bottoming out again.Experts have warned that while the increase in infections in the city appear to be still in the nascent stages, it is crucial for the government to closely monitor the numbers, ensure adherence to Covid appropriate behaviour, and increase testing, contact tracing and vaccination.The city also reported two deaths due to the infection on Friday, which is the highest in 45 days, since September 28, data shows. There have only been four deaths in the past 30 days, and six deaths were reported in the 30 days before that, and 14 in the 30 days prior. In comparison, at the peak of the second wave, 448 deaths were recorded in a single day on May 3.“An increase in the number of cases has been reported not only in Delhi but from across the country – cases went up in West Bengal after Diwali; number of deaths has increased in Maharashtra and Kerala as well. There is an increasing trend and we need to be vigilant...,” said Dr Suneela Garg, professor of community medicine at Maulana Azad Medical College and a member of the Lancet Commission on Covid-19 in India.A minor blip in trajectory of Covid-19 cases in Delhi that began towards the end of October appears to have now gathered momentum, with the new infection rate appearing to slowly rise again after a bottoming out, the data shows.The seven-day average of new Covid-19 cases (a number which reflects the case trajectory of a region) in Delhi has now risen by 68% from lows seen after the end of the brutal second wave of the pandemic (from 25 cases a day week ending October 21, to 42 cases a day for week ending Friday). Incidentally, the October 21 case rate was the lowest Delhi’s wave has dropped to in the year-and-a-half of the outbreak expanding in the country.To be sure, these numbers are still minuscule compared to the previous wave of infections in Delhi – at the peak of the city’s fourth wave (which coincided with the brutal second wave of infections in India), the Capital was reporting and average of 25,294 new cases a day for the week ending April 26, 2021.The Covid-19 positivity rate, too, has started inching up, data shows. The seven-day average of positivity rate, which had dropped to a near all-time low of 0.05% three weeks ago (for the week ended October 22) has risen marginally to 0.9% for the week ended Friday.Experts have said this rise is particularly worrying as it comes at a time when fever wards are already full of dengue cases. The largest Covid-19 hospital in the city, Lok Nayak, is currently receiving five times as many dengue cases as Covid-19, with their fever ward running full.“We are still seeing some Covid-19 patients, probably five to six a day. But dengue cases continue to remain high; every day we see 20-30 dengue patients... we have started a 100-bed fever ward for all those who come in with mosquito borne diseases, seasonal flu, and Covid-19. It is almost always 80% full,” said a senior doctor from the hospital, on condition of anonymity.Experts said that the state government needed to step up its testing and tracking activities, whereas the central government needed to reduce the gap between two doses of Covishield.“...the government should test more people and trace 15 to 20 contacts for each. There is a need to ensure that people follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour... In addition, we have seen that there is a huge gap between the numbers of people who have received the first dose of the vaccine and the second dose. This is important especially because we have seen in Israel that despite vaccinating a high proportion of the population there was an increase in cases,” said Garg.She added, it was also time for the government to think about allowing booster doses in the health care workers.Around 88% of Delhi’s adult population have received at least one vaccine dose, as against a national average of 79.8%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-sees-2-deaths-as-covid-cases-rise-101636766954927.html
13-11-2021||Bhopal||MP govt writes to home ministry about renaming Habibganj rail station||The Madhya Pradesh government has written to the Ministry of Home Affairs about renaming the recently redeveloped Habibganj station after Rani Kamlapati, the 18th Century Gond queen of the region.The letter from the state's transport department has said that renaming the station is also in accordance with the Indian government's decision to celebrate November 15 as 'Janjatiya Gaurav Diwas' in remembrance of revered tribal leader and freedom fighter Birsa Munda.Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate the station which has been redeveloped at a cost of ₹100 crore on November 15, the day government launches the 'Janjatiya Gaurav Diwas', a week-long celebration of the pride of the Scheduled Tribes in India.The letter also explains the reason behind the decision to rename the station.Rani Kamlapati was the widow Gond ruler of Nizam Shah, chief of Ginnorgarh. The Gond community comprises the largest tribal group of India with more than 1.2 crore population. Linguistically, the Gonds belong to the Gondi–Manda subgroup of the South Central branch of the Dravidian language family.The letter states that the renaming of the station will honour Rani Kamlapati's legacy and bravery.The decision of the state government to rename the station as Rani Kamlapati station comes a day after BJP MP from Bhopal Pragya Singh Thakur demanded that the station be renamed after former Prime Minister late Atal Bihari Vajpayee."Arrival of the hon'ble prime minister on 15/11/2021 to participate in Janajatiy Gaurav Diwas is a good omen for Bhopal. I am sure that Modi ji will announce to rename Habibganj railway station in the name of former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji and fulfil my old request," Thakur said in a tweet on Thursday.The name of Allahabad railway station has been changed to Prayagraj and Mughalsarai railway junction ras been renamed Pt Deen Dayal Upadhyay junction.

13-11-2021||Delhi||Stubble fires at record high as a ‘river of smoke’ flows over Delhi||This year, the number of farm fires in the second week of November is at a record high, offering worrying signs that the problem might not relent anytime soon.Data from heat-sensing satellites accessed by HT show that since November 8, there have been 24,694 fire events, higher than the 16,931 in the same period in 2016 which was previously the highest.Pawan Gupta, senior scientist, earth sciences (USRA), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Marshall Space Flight Centre, said that when seen from satellite images, Delhi currently looks to be engulfed in a “river of smoke”. “You can see the river of smoke over Delhi even in the afternoon hours, when winds tend to pick up and clear up the smoke,” said Gupta.According to the data accessed by HT from the SUOMI VIIRS C2, FIRMS-NASA resource, there have been 70,655 fire events recorded this year, which has inched closer to the 73,788 recorded in 2020. Last year, however, the farm fires were spread more evenly through the month, possibly helping dispersion, in particularly so since conditions are windier in October.The highest number of farm fires recorded in any year was in 2016, with 93,211 recorded events.Union ministry of earth science’, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) said that on Friday, the share of farm fires in the amount of pollutants in Delhi’s air went up from 26% on Thursday to 35%. The analysis indicated that while the fire count will remain nearly the same, stubble smoke share in Delhi could reduce marginally in the next two days.“Winds at transport level are likely to reduce from November 13 evening leading to less transport of pollutants from upwind region to Delhi,” Safar said.Experts said late monsoon withdrawal and few intense post-monsoon spells in the month of October shortened the window for farmers in Punjab and Haryana to prepare their fields for the next crop season. They also said stubble burning is likely to continue till November-end and Delhi should brace for further deterioration of air quality.“Delhi has been experiencing severe air quality levels since November 10, 9 pm. According to Delhi’s Early Warning System, calm winds in the evening and morning hours are responsible for trapping pollutants. While faster surface winds favour pollution dispersion, relatively calmer winds are extremely unfavourable for the dispersion of pollutants,” said Tanushree Ganguly, programme lead, Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW).“Besides, the last eight days have witnessed a spike in farm fires in nearby states with daily counts reporting in the range of 3000-6000 fires. Additional emission load from farm fires due to northwest winds are further amplifying pollution levels in Delhi. According to forecasts, air quality is likely to remain in very poor and severe conditions for the next two days on account of unfavourable meteorology,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/stubble-fires-at-record-high-as-a-river-of-smoke-flows-over-delhi-101636765898821.html
13-11-2021||Delhi||Dust and smoke from farm fires in deadly cocktail||The toxic smog in Delhi’s air on Friday was a hazardous amalgamation of smoke from farm fires in the nearby states of Punjab and Haryana, and Delhi’s local pollution sources such as vehicle emissions, open garbage burning and dust from construction, according to environmental experts.The estimates are from the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology’s (IITM) decision support system (DSS), which provides a forecast for Delhi’s air quality and identifies the components of the pollution, which at present includes a spike in all major sources.The analysis said that on Friday, Delhi also received pollutants from other cities such as Jhajjar, Gurugram, Baghpat, Ghaziabad and Sonepat.“While stubble smoke remained the primary external pollution source, pollutants from other neighbouring cities also contributed to Delhi’s pollution levels. This was because Delhi shares an air shed with the entire Indo-Gangetic Plains and while measures can be taken to control the city’s local pollutants, there is still around 20-30% pollution share that comes into the Capital from other states,” said a IITM scientist, who asked not to be named.The DSS analysis showed that on Friday, paddy stubble fires contributed to 15% of Delhi’s PM 2.5 (ultrafine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres), local vehicular emissions had a share of 25%, emissions from households contributed to 7% of the particulate levels and industries in Delhi and its peripheries made up 9-10% of the city’s pollution profile.SAFAR, the Union ministry of earth sciences’ air quality monitoring station said that the stubble fires accounted to at least 35% of pollutants in the air on Friday.Weather experts said that apart from the pollutants, a large part of Delhi’s air also had high moisture content.“What we are seeing currently is trapping of pollutants, but along with pollutants, moisture is also being trapped and re-circulating. When moisture increases, the size of pollutants also increases and it starts expanding. Because of this sun rays are not able to reach the ground,” said Harish Madhavan, a Delhi-based independent meteorologist.IMD scientists said that the haze in the city can be called ‘smog’, which is a toxic mix of water vapour, smoke and other pollutants.“The visibility levels remained in the 300-800 metres range throughout the day. It is the first time this season that we have seen such poor visibility throughout the day. Even during afternoon hours, there was a thick cover of smog. Yesterday (Thursday), the smog was there, but by afternoon visibility improved to 800-1200 metres,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist, IMD.Experts also explained that apart from primary pollutants, which are released directly from sources, Delhi’s air also saw a toxic mix of hazardous chemicals such as sulphur dioxides and nitrogen oxides. These are formed by reaction of primary pollutants with the atmosphere. By the time pollutants from sources such as industries and biomass burning in the neighbouring states reach Delhi, they react with other pollutants or water molecules in the air to change and become more toxic.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) said while the governments cannot change the weather conditions, during such emergency conditions, they can work towards controlling the local pollution sources.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dust-and-smoke-from-farm-fires-in-deadly-cocktail-101636765548570.html
13-11-2021||Delhi||Air trap around Delhi may stay for a week||There may be no respite for the next seven days from the toxic smoke and hazardous pollution levels, scientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) warned, and added that weather conditions unfavourable to the dispersal of pollutants are likely to continue for a week.VK Soni, head of IMD’s environment and research department, said calm local winds were trapping pollution from stubble fires in Punjab and Haryana, and the Capital’s local pollution closer to the surface. High moisture levels have worsened this condition, as it helps pollutants stay suspended close to the surface.“After Diwali, when cracker smoke and stubble fires peaked, the winds have remained slow, which resulted in an accumulation of pollutants. On Friday, during the day, the wind speed was only around 6kmph, and after sundown it became even more calm. Similar, conditions are being seen over the last few days,” said Soni.IMD data shows that the relative humidity in Delhi at 8.30am on Friday was 93%. As the day progressed the humidity levels came down to 69%, but still stayed unfavourable for dispersal of the pollutants.A Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) scientist explained that when moisture content increases in the air, the secondary pollution particles—particles that are formed by chemical reactions in the atmosphere—swell up in size.“As they grow bigger by absorbing moisture, the pollutants and particles block the sunlight from reaching the surface and form a hazy blanket,” the scientist explained, asking not to be named. As the sunlight stays away, the air stays cold and dense making it difficult for the pollutants to disperse.He added that such conditions are rare for this time of the year, and are usually seen by November-end or December.“These conditions are abnormal. During this time of the year, while pollution levels do spike, we get a few bouts of moderate to high speed winds that facilitate pollution dispersion. But that has not happened this time and consistently, the winds have remained stable,” the scientist added.Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change), Skymet Weather Services, said Delhi is yet to receive any western disturbance this month, which either brings rain to clear the air or improves wind speed. He also said that the weather condition where two winds—northwesterly from Punjab and Haryana and southeasterly from a depression over the Bay of Bengal—are colliding over the city is also continuing, creating a barrier for the movement of pollutants.“This time in November, we are yet to see a western disturbance, and there is no forecast for at least the next five days. Usually, we see around two to three western disturbances by this time. This year, it last happened on October 24,” Palawat said.Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai blamed the stubble fires in Punjab and Haryana for the persistent pollution episode, and said the state governments did little to prevent the annual fire incidents. He added that strict directions have been issued to all agencies in the city to control local pollution sources so that the air quality does not worsen.“The current levels of pollution are spiking due to the consistent increase in stubble burning from Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh. It has been reported that a total of 45,000 stubble burning incidents have been reported till now from these regions. The impact of these fires is being witnessed by the people of Delhi as the air accumulates more pollution,” Rai said.He also said government is implementing anti-dust campaign, anti-burning campaign, and the Red Light On, Gaadi Off campaign to control pollution from local sources.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/air-trap-around-delhi-may-stay-for-a-week-101636765218526.html
13-11-2021||Delhi||Breath by breath: Pollution levels in Delhi may trigger health emergency||Severe levels of pollution pose a health risk to not only those who have respiratory diseases or compromised immunity but also healthy people, experts said, adding that breathing in heavily polluted air for a prolonged period adversely affects not just the lungs but also other vital organs in the body.Air pollution was the top risk factor for death in India in 2019, killing an estimated 1.67 million people, according to the Global Burden of Disease report.Delhi on Friday reported an average Air Quality Index of 471 -- the highest reported so far this year, as a toxic haze hung over the city. Individual air quality monitoring stations reported much higher AQI with Mandir Marg at 494, Chandni Chowk (491), ITO (490) and Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium and Patparganj at 486.Here is how, the polluted air affects some vital organs of the human body.Chokes lungsThe respiratory system comprises nose, throat, respiratory tubes and the lungs. PM 2.5 and PM 10 is considered dangerous because these are of respirable size, and can travel down to the lowest part of the lung where gas exchange takes place.“When we say PM 2.5 or 10, it’s just the particle size that we are talking and the kind of damage depends on the source of that particle such as firecrackers, fuel combustion, stubble burning, etc. The particulate matter formed due to diesel or kerosene burning can even cause lung cancer,” says Dr GC Khilnani, former head of pulmonology department, AIIMS, Delhi.The damage starts with inflammation of the airway, and finer the particulate matter, the deeper it penetrates. “What nobody talks much about and do the maximum damage are ultrafine particles of 0.1 micron or less. These penetrate the lung and reach the blood stream, and once in blood these can reach anywhere — the brain, the heart, kidneys etc. Even perfectly healthy persons can experience short-term symptoms such as breathing issues, sore throat or red eyes,” Dr Khilnani said.Harms the heartBreathing in heavily polluted air can cause irreversible damage to the cardiac arteries.“When the fine particles that lungs aren’t able to filter reach the blood stream, they get attached to the walls of the arteries. Over a period, it could lead to the formation of clots and may cause blockage. There’s sudden narrowing of the blood vessels that eventually can lead to a heart attack,” said Dr Upendra Kaul, chairman, cardiology, Batra Hospital & Medical Research Centre.Respiratory diseases such as chronic bronchitis can also cause damage to the heart, he added.Impacts the brainWhen heart malfunctions, it automatically also affects the brain functioning by restricting the flow of blood or oxygen flow, said Dr Deepak Aggarwal, professor, neurosurgery, AIIMS. “Also, inhaling pollutants emits certain chemical responses within the body that can also cause stroke over a period of time,” he said.Since pollutants affect a person’s immunity, it can also cause autoimmune disorders. “Exposure to pollutants can also lead to a condition called vasculitis, meaning inflammation of blood vessels that leads to narrowing of the vessels. This may cause stroke,” he added.Children vulnerableYoung lungs are vulnerable as they breathe in twice the rate than adults, which makes them inhale larger amounts of harmful pollutants, doctors said.“Though it is not practical to ask kids to stay indoors, we should ensure they avoid outdoor activities during early mornings and evenings when pollution is at its worse,” Dr JS Bhasin, head of paediatric department, BLK Super Speciality Hospital||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/breath-by-breath-pollution-levels-in-delhi-may-trigger-health-emergency-101636764452266.html
13-11-2021||Lucknow||Lakhimpur violence: UP seeks more time to respond to SC||The Uttar Pradesh government on Friday sought some more time from the Supreme Court to revert to the court’s recommendation for appointing a retired high court judge from outside Uttar Pradesh to oversee the probe into the Lakhimpur Kheri incident so as to “infuse fairness, independence and faith” into it.The top court has been critical of the manner in which the state police have so far conducted the investigation in the case where eight people died in the incident on October 3 -- four farmers, three Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers, and a journalist.Representing the UP government, senior counsel Harish Salve asked for some time from the bench, led by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana, saying: “Please give me a day or two. Something is being worked out.”On Salve’s request, the bench, which also comprised justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli, adjourned the case to November 15.On November 8, the bench had pulled up the UP police, commenting that the investigation into the Lakhimpur Kheri incident appears to be favouring the “main accused” in the case.The remarks continued the trend of the top court’s dissatisfaction with the probe in the case where a convoy, in which at least one vehicle belonged to Union minister Ajay Mishra ‘Teni’, ran over farmers protesting three farm laws.Ashish Mishra, the son of the minister, is one of the accused in one of the two cases (the convoy running over farmers) being investigated. The other case being investigated by the police relates to the lynchings of some of the occupants of vehicles in the convoy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lakhimpur-violence-up-seeks-more-time-to-respond-to-sc-101636762235907.html
13-11-2021||Lucknow||UP elections: Akhilesh Yadav to launch third phase of ‘Vijay Yatra’ from Gorakhpur today||Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav will on Saturday arrive in Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath's home turf of Gorakhpur, from where he will begin the third phase of his Samajwadi Vijay Yatra, which the party launched in October to connect with the voters ahead of next year's assembly elections in the state.Spread across two days, the third phase will end on November 14 in Kushinagar.

Kaur, who was interacting with mediapersons in Amritsar, said, “Earlier, when Khaira got an ED notice, everyone said he will not be arrested. Now, he has been arrested because he did something wrong with the money that came from abroad. You have never seen MLAs being arrested like this before. A case of rape was also registered against (Lok Insaaf Party MLA) Simarjet Singh Bains.”Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala condemned the arrest of Khaira who was elected as MLA on Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) ticket and recently joined the Congress. Navjot Kaur said on the high court’s direction, the report of the special task force (STF) on drug smuggling is being opened on November 19. “The first name mentioned in the report is that of a senior Akali leader. You will see that justice being done,” she added. Forty percent of the buses being impounded are run by Congress leaders, Kaur said. “The ruling party MLAs have also been asked to meet the criteria or they will face action. Therefore, action is being taken by rising above political lines,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-ex-mla-khaira-s-arrest-vindicates-congress-govt-acting-strictly-navjot-kaur-101636749887913.html
13-11-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab government yet to start process for new advocate general’s appointment||The Punjab government is still to start the process for the appointment of new advocate general (AG) even as four days have passed since the incumbent’s resignation was accepted by the state cabinet. Senior officials in the chief minister’s office (CMO) said the file on APS Deol’s resignation as AG was still to be cleared by governor Banwarilal Purohit who arrived in Chandigarh from the national capital on Friday afternoon. While accepting Deol’s resignation on November 9, chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi had said in a press conference that the new AG will be appointed the next day. “It got delayed as the governor was away. He is probably going to clear the resignation by today evening. The process for the appointment of new AG will start only after,” an official privy with the development said. The CM is likely to appoint the new AG after discussing the matter with the Cabinet to avoid any embarrassment further. “Even as choosing AG is the CM’s prerogative but he is likely to take every member of his council into confidence in the wake of the controversy that had erupted over Deol’s appointment,” he added. No date has been fixed for the next cabinet meeting yet. Deol had to resign following a standoff between Channi and Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu for over a month over the appointment. Sidhu pressurised Channi to replace Deol as he had represented former director general of police (DGP) Sumedh Singh Saini in cases of police firing at the time of Bargari sacrilege. No communication from UPSC on DGP’s appointment The state home department has not received any information about the meeting to be convened by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) over the appointment of the new DGP. A panel of nine officials was sent by the Punjab government to the UPSC on September 30 but there has been no communication over holding the meeting to shortlist three officers for the top post. The Punjab chief secretary will also be part of the meeting as per the protocol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-government-yet-to-start-process-for-new-advocate-general-s-appointment-101636749525491.html

The accused, EPD Avtar Singh, peon Varun Kumar and sewerman Karan Sood, were captured fleecing residents in Ram Nagar of Ward 27. The employees were seen charging ₹800 against the actual fee of ₹200 for regularising the connections. The Class 3 and 4 employees fleeced eight residents of ₹2,500. They were made to return the money. A video of the incident, which was widely circulated on social media, also shows the staffers apologising to the public after their con was discovered. Superintending engineer Rajinder Singh said strict departmental action has been recommended against the employees. Municipal corporation commissioner Pardep Sabharwal also marked an inquiry to joint commissioner Ankur Mahindroo. He also asked residents to check the rates at the MC website and ask for receipts while making payment for getting connections regularised.591 illegal connections caught in two zonesWith the MC starting door-to-door surveys to check illegal water-sewer connections, 591 illegal connections were found in Zones A and D. The report of the other two zones is being compiled.The survey is being conducted in four blocks of the MC, including blocks 29, 31, 32 and 34, which comprise around 2-lakh properties.Around 1,100 properties were checked in areas falling under the Zone D and around 1,300 in Zone A, of which 281 and 310 properties were found to have illegal connections in either zones. With the OTS policy getting a lukewarm response, mayor Balkar Sandhu had on November 9 directed the MC to conduct a door-to-door survey in four major blocks of the city to catch defaulters and regularise their connections. Only around 4,000 defaulters have applied under the policy, while the MC suspects that there are over 1 lakh illegal connections in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/regularising-illegal-water-sewer-connections-3-ludhiana-mc-staffers-in-the-soup-for-fleecing-residents-101636749227433.html

Dhillon, who was conferred with Padma Shri for agricultural research in 2019 and had declined further extension in his tenure in June this year, said the number of farm fires needed to be interpreted carefully. “There is a growing sense of frustration among farmers who are sitting at the borders of Delhi. Weather also compounded the problem. Late rain narrowed the window between paddy harvesting and wheat sowing,” said Dhillon.The number of incidents this year and the last time should not be seen as parameters to assess the efficacy of the efforts being made by institutions and departments concerned, he said.“If we managed to achieve the target of utilising 54 percent of stubble since 2016, it is an indicator that we have both the expertise and intent to manage the crop residue,” said Dhillon.With the rise in diesel prices and other farm machinery, the in-situ and ex-situ management of paddy straw has become more expensive, he said.“Both the state government and opposition parties making noises about offering bonuses to farmers, but incentives are elusive,” said Dhillon.In January, Dhillon had said the 3 laws were formed in haste and that there should have been a broader consultation with farmers and other stakeholders before they were enacted. He has stated that agriculture is a state subject and there should be no roadblock to legalise the minimum support price (MSP).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/stubble-burning-a-way-of-registering-protest-by-farmers-former-pau-v-c-dhillon-101636749225803.html
13-11-2021||Chandigarh||Farm fire smog: Bathinda sees six days with half of normal bright sunshine hours in November||Punjab’s Bathinda district in November so far has witnessed six days with no more than half of normal bright sunshine hours amid a blanket of haze as the burning of paddy stubble continues unabated in the state. Moreover, the district saw zero bright sunshine hours on Thursday, according to the observatory of Punjab Agricultural University’s regional research centre. On Friday too, hazy conditions prevailed in the morning and there was no sunshine in the afternoon. The exact details of bright hours for the day will be released on Saturday.Senior agrometeorology scientist at PAU Raj Kumar said the drastically reduced sunshine time was due to heavy smog in air. “Weather conditions are dry for over two weeks and there should have been complete bright sunshine time for average 8-10 hours per day. But as the burning of crop residue in the fields is being reported across the state, bright sunshine hours are adversely impacted,” he said.On three days of November, bright sunshine was seen for six hours, and one day, full sunlight was recorded for seven hours. November 1 was the only day when the sunshine hour was recorded for full 8 hours.Paddy harvesting in southern Punjab gained momentum from November 1 and there has been a spike in the number of farm fires in the region since.Seven districts of the south Malwa belt have reported a daily average of 1,672 farm fire cases since November 1, adding up to the air pollution.Sunil Mittal, dean of school of environment and earth sciences at Bathinda-based Central University of Punjab, said reduced bright hours are also likely in the adjoining districts of Malwa as smog conditions are similar. A blanket of pollutant particulate matter created in the atmosphere has lowered the surface temperature by 3 degrees Celsius than the normal temperature.“Such conditions during the winter are conducive for various viral infections. Reduced sunshine hours are expected to stay for another 10 days and smog might cause serious discomfort to vulnerable sections,” said Mittal.On Friday, 3,403 farm fires were reported in Punjab and 1,421 incidents were recorded from seven districts of south Malwa.Maximum 619 fire incidents were reported from Sangrur. Moga, Ludhiana, Patiala, Bathinda and Barnala districts reported more than 200 fire cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farm-fire-smog-bathinda-sees-six-days-with-half-of-normal-bright-sunshine-hours-in-november-101636748865463.html

In a press release, Chugh lambasted Sidhu for “ his completely irresponsible and reprehensible statements targeted at spreading fear among businessmen and traders in the state”. “Sidhu is using such language because he has been deprived of the post of chief minister. His desperation and frustration is reflected in his anti-national sentiments that he keeps expressing off and on,” he added.

13-11-2021||Chandigarh||Sacrilege conspiracy hatched at sect’s Sirsa headquarters: SIT in status report to high court||The conspiracy of desecration of Sikh scriptures was hatched at the administrative block of Dera Sacha Sauda in Sirsa and that the followers never acted without the permission of sect head Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, the special investigation team (SIT) probing the 2015 sacrilege cases said in a status report filed in the Punjab and Haryana high court on Friday. The SIT led by inspector general of police Surinder Pal Singh Parmar submitted the 65-page status report by way of a nine-page affidavit of its member and senior superintendent of police (SSP) Mukhwinder Singh Bhullar. An interrogation report, including a copy of the questionnaire as well as replies, of Ram Rahim Singhwas filed along with the affidavit. On November 8, the SIT had asked 114 questions from the sect leader during his grilling for more than seven hours at the Sunaria jail in Rohtak. The probe team also told the bench of Justice Manoj Bajaj that the present petition may be dismissed as the custodial interrogation of the accused (Ram Rahim) was imperative to unravel the conspiracy behind the 2015 sacrilege incidents. The matter was adjourned for December 17. “Though Ram Rahim answered all the questions of the SIT members, his replies were evasive. He pretended to be ignorant of the occurrences around him, when the desecrations took place in Punjab,” the probe team report read. The dera’s national committee members Harsh Dhuri, Sandeep Bareta and Pardeep Kler directed the actual perpetrators to commit acts of sacrilege in a particular area of Punjab, it added. “It is clear that if the planning of the crime was done at the dera headquarters, Ram Rahim was bound to be involved in the whole episode. Keeping in mind his criminal bent of mind since he has already been convicted in three cases of murder and rape, it can be easily concluded that he is the main culprit in all the cases. Moreover, it is an open secret that the dera members did not do a single act without the permission of dera head and were willing to lay down their lives for him,” the SIT further said. The SIT also submitted the statements of witnesses Pardeep Kumar and Gopal Krishan, three dera followers Jatinder Veer Arora, Prithvi Singh and Mithus Singh Mann, accused in the 2015 Moga sacrilege case and confessional statement of the sect’s state committee member Mohinder Pal Bittu, who was killed in the Nabha jail in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sacrilege-conspiracy-hatched-at-sect-s-sirsa-headquarters-sit-in-status-report-to-high-court-101636748445764.html

That an explosive was found in a posh city area has cops puzzled. Such explosives have been detected earlier too, but from Focal Point or rural areas. Officials suspect that the rocket shell could have reached the park with scrap brought from the canal. “It is possible that an industrialist may have imported it and then disposed it of in the canal. Those scouting the river for coins after Chhath Puja may have found the shell and dumped it in the park,” he said. Joint commissioner of police (JCP) J Elanchezhian said, “The bomb squad of the Punjab Police is well-trained and equipped. The team defused the shell with the help of a controlled explosion.”“We are still investigating the matter to determine how the shell reached the residential area. We are also scanning CCTV footage,”said the JCP.With Ludhiana being the industrial hub of the state, chances of live ammunition entering the city mixed with scrap are very high. The city frequently imports scrap from Bay Countries - Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia and Sumatra. In the past, live shells have been recovered from canals, sewerage and vacant plots. Besides, the city was the epicentre of terrorist activity during the militancy, which has also led to recovery of weapons years later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/rocket-shell-defused-near-ladhowal-in-ludhiana-101636748205561.html

13-11-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Parking pangs plague Ward No. 5||Ward number 5 is the second of the three wards into which Manimajra has been divided. It comprises Thakur Dwara and Old Manimajra (NAC) from the older ward number 25 and Pipliwala Town, Darshni Bagh, Subhash Nagar, Dhillon Complex and Motor Market, Manimajra, from the older ward number 26. The newer ward number 5 has emerged as the most commercially active of the three wards of Manimajra with market areas like Motor Market, NAC Market and Dhillon Complex, while also bringing the charm of Old Manimara into it. The ward has been reserved for women candidates only for the upcoming elections.Parking woes top the list of the problems being faced by the residents of the area. This is at its worst at the Motor Market here, with no space left for pedestrians as most of the times mechanics repair vehicles on the road.Rajinder Singh, who has been working here since the 80s, says, “The next councillor must drive through the area to get a first-hand experience of the parking issues plaguing the area. The traffic problem has become only worse as we can sometimes find JCBs parked on road for repairs. The next councillor needs to work in tandem with the traffic police and challan those who block roads.”Garbage raising a stinkHeaps of garbage can be seen all over the place in the Motor Market. In contrast, regular cleaning and hygiene are maintained at the NAC market. However, shopkeepers here have their own problems. President of the market association, NAC, Suresh Bansal, said, “Though we have paid parking, contractors don’t manage it at all. Recently, a lot of vendors have also started sitting outside shops, which are creating problems for shopkeepers. While the earlier councillors remained accessible to us, we hope that the next councillor will liaise better with the MC as we have to call them repeatedly to pick up waste from gardens here, which they are required to do.”In Old Manimajra, roads are narrow and spats over parking is a regular affair. However, hygiene is an even bigger problem here. Fateh Singh, 65, a resident of NAC, Manimajra, said, “The cleanliness situation has gone from bad to worse. Due to meat markets here, vehicles carrying chicken are parked close to our houses leading to a foul smell here. The next councillor must take measures to ensure cleanliness in the area. Also, all colleges are too far from Manimajra. We hope the councillor can initiate the process to open a college here.”Present councillor Jagtar Singh Jagga said, “The water supply here was a big problem and at one point, sewage was getting mixed into the water supply. We got the water supply revamped with sewerage lines getting placed away from freshwater lines. Manimajra will also be the first in the city to receive 24/7 water supply. I have got all streetlights fixed here and replaced them with LED lights.”Local Congress office holder Rameshwar Giri, however, said, “The situation has become worse. The law and order situation has deteriorated and drugs are being openly sold in Old Manimajra. The maintenance of parks is abysmal. Sewage water still gets mixed with supply water which is why so many people here are falling sick.”Old Manimajra resident Mohammad Imran also said contaminated water had remained an ongoing problem in the ward which hasn’t been resolved.Know your wardLocalities: Old Manimajra (NAC), Pipliwala Town, Thakur Dwara, Darshni Bagh, Subhash Nagar, Dhillon Complex and Motor Market ManimajraReserved for women (general)Voters: 20,000Key issuesShortage of parking and narrow roads in Old ManimajraDumping of garbage near residential areas, especially around the Motor Market, and hygiene issuesContaminated and irregular water supplyLocal voicesThe place needs better road connectivity and cleanliness must improve.

For any problem, MC officials blame the administration and vice versa. We want a councillor who solves our issues rather than blaming others. The cleanliness of the area needs to be checked, especially in the present times with a high number of dengue cases here. -- Jaswinder Singh, 50, a resident of Manimajra NAC, who owns a grocery shop The motor market needs to be managed better. Roads should be kept clear and the area must be cleaned regularly. Garbage should not be thrown in the open. It should be picked up regularly and taken to the dumping ground. Those repairing cars on main roads should be punished. -- Rajinder Singh, 54, who runs a workshop in the Manimajra Motor MarketPaid parkings here are not run properly. The encroachment by vendors in markets has risen. The new councillor needs to fix this.

Amit was visiting a sweets shop just before noon when he as attacked with sharp-edged weapons and glass bottles. Desperate to save himself, the victim had even tried to hide in a shop, but all in vain. He was rushed to the PGIMER, where he succumbed to his injuries. Police later arrested five men for the crime.

13-11-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC allows traders to run parking lots in internal markets||The General House of the Chandigarh municipal corporation on Friday gave the green signal for allowing market associations to manage parking lots in the city’s internal markets.There will be no parking fee as the House decided that the associations will have to run these parking lots for free.All markets located along the V4 roads (which bisect the sectors) are to be transferred to the associations. The next step will be the signing of memorandum of understanding (MoU) between the associations and the MC.The MC aims to improve parking management in internal markets, while at the same time offering it for free to the public.After the civic body’s earlier attempts to bring these parking lots under the purview of private parking contractors faced stiff opposition from market associations, the MC House in February 2019 had directed the officials to prepare a draft MoU for operation and management of parking lots in internal markets by market associations.The associations had contended that handing over parking lots to contractors will increase parking rates, making the markets unattractive for shoppers.Thereafter, an MC committee was constituted to prepare the draft MoU. The market associations in its meetings with the committee requested it to formulate two draft MoUs, one for operating the parking lots for free and another on “no profit no loss” basis.“Under the no profit no loss basis, markets were to charge the users to cover their parking management expenses, which had come to around ₹5 for car parking and ₹2 for scooter parking,” said Charanjiv Singh, a nominated councillor and Chandigarh Beopar Mandal (CBM) president. The CBM is an umbrella organisation of 80 market associations, which was holding talks with the MC committee on the issue. Among these 80 markets, 60 are located on V4 roads. The CBM assured the MC committee that it would persuade all associations to take up these parking lots for public convenience.After two draft MoUs were finalised by the committee, these were submitted to the MC commissioner, who directed that only the one for free parking should be prepared and tabled before the House for approval. The House in its meeting concurred with the commissioner’s observation and decided that market associations willing to take over parking lots must not charge any parking fee from the users.No licence fee exemption to parking contractorsPrivate firms engaged to manage parking lots in Chandigarh could face cancellation of their contract after the Chandigarh municipal corporation’s General House on Friday rejected their demand for licence fee exemptions worth around ₹2 crore.Already served recovery notice for outstanding dues by the MC, the contractors will now be served revised notices amounting to around ₹3.6 crore.If dues are not paid within the stipulated period, the civic body will initiate cancellation proceedings and take over 89 parking lots allotted to them, said MC commissioner Anindita Mitra during the General House meeting on Friday.Divided into two zones, the parking lots are being run by two parking contractors. On account of the Covid-19 pandemic and free parking extended to all MC employees, the contractors had sought licence fee exemption. For Zone 1, the exemption sought was ₹1.02 crore, and for Zone 2, it was ₹98.64 lakh.Till October 31, Zone 1 owes around ₹1.2 crore and Zone 2 around ₹2.4 crore, for which recovery notices will be issued, said SK Jain, MC additional commissioner.Immediately after the agenda for the remission of the licence fee came up for discussion before the MC House on Friday, both Bharatiya Janata Party and Congress councilors opposed the move.Leader of opposition Devinder Singh Babla said: “The companies cannot threat us in the form of surrendering the parking lot or going to court. They don’t deserve these exemptions at all.”Showing a picture of misuse of a “handicap parking” by a contractor, BJP councillor and former mayor Davesh Moudgil said: “Even after many directions, the contractors continue to mismanage the parking lots. The violations are galore and we cannot allow public money to go waste on their undeserved exemptions.”Reacting to the MC House resolution, Vikas Pandey, manager of the firm operating parking lots in Zone 2, said: “We will again request the MC to reconsider its decision. We are only seeking what is genuine. During the pandemic lockdown, the parking lots were closed. We are also providing free parking to MC employees. Moving court will be our last resort to seek justice.”A month’s vending fee waived in view of pandemicTaking into account the adverse affects of the coronavirus pandemic on the livelihoods of street vendors, the Chandigarh municipal corporation waived off their vending fee for May 2021 on Friday.Those who have been defaulting on their vending fee prior to January 1, 2020 or have had their certificates suspended or cancelled at any stage will not be eligible for the exemption. As many as 7,240 street vendors are eligible for the fee waive-off, while 3,677 others are not. The decision was taken at the MC general house meeting.The MC house also decided to waive off the licence fee of firms managing unipoles for 90 days and for those managing advertisements at 55 public toilets for 45 days. Fee amounting to ₹77.81 lakh will be waived off. The firms had sought exemption on account of the pandemic. In another decision, it was decided that Group D employees of the municipal corporation will be insured under the Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana at an annual cost of ₹87,192.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-mc-allows-traders-to-run-parking-lots-in-internal-markets-101636746830564.html
13-11-2021||Chandigarh||Mohali cop in dock after he turns hostile in drugs case||A Mohali court has ordered legal action against Phase-1 station house officer (SHO) inspector Shiv Deep Singh for allegedly giving false evidence and turning hostile in a drug seizure case that led to the suspect’s acquittal. Additional and district sessions judge Parminder Singh Grewal has fixed the next date of hearing on November 18 to initiate legal proceedings against the cop under relevant sections of the Criminal Procedure Code. The case dates back to November 2019, when one Mukesh Kumar, alias Kaka, was arrested from near the old bus stand in Phase 9 for carrying restricted drugs (1,080 tablets of lomotil and 300 tablets of alpranof). A case was registered under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS) Act at the Phase 8 police station, where Shiv Deep Singh was stationed as the SHO at the time.The SHO was a prosecution witness when the case went to trial. The judge said that the court is of considered view that inspector Shiv Deep Singh did not support the prosecution case, and on the request of the additional public prosecutor, the court declared him hostile on the ground that “he was suppressing the truth with regard to facts deposed by him before the police in the shape of his statement recorded during the course of the investigation”. “Inspector Shiv Deep Singh has stated incorrect and untrue facts in his examination in chief with respect to the role played by him during the course of the investigation, which prima facie amounts to the offence made punishable for giving of false evidence,” the court observed. The court said that if the additional public prosecutor for the state had not taken due care and caution at the time of recording the testimony of the cop during the trial, then the latter might have demolished the entire case of the prosecution regarding the recoveries made from the suspect. The judge has issued a show-cause notice to the inspector as well as the court ahlmad to separate the papers, including the copy of the challan, the copy of the aforesaid statement of the inspector recorded during trial and the copy of the judgment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohali-cop-in-dock-after-he-turns-hostile-in-drugs-case-101636746828408.html

While two people had died in September, 29 succumbed to the virus in October and six have died in November. This is the deadliest outbreak in years. The previous two years had recorded just one death each. Meanwhile, no fatality was reported from Chandigarh and Panchkula on Friday. The health authorities also confirmed 98 fresh cases in the tricity, with Mohali reporting 57, followed by 25 in Chandigarh and 16 in Panchkula.Chandigarh has so far recorded 1,182 dengue cases, of which 293 surfaced in November. It has recorded just three deaths this year. Mohali’s dengue count has now gone up to 3,558 while Panchkula’s case tally stands at 784 with one death this year.Health dept issues advisory for Zika virus diseaseThe Chandigarh health department on Friday issued an advisory on Zika virus, after cases were reported in Uttar Pradesh.The virus is primarily transmitted through the bite of an infected species of aedes mosquito, the same mosquito that is responsible for causing dengue and chikungunya. Other routes for transmission are maternal-foetal, sexual transmission from an infected person to his or her partners and blood transfusion.Doctors requested people to cover all water tanks and containers with tight lids, to dispose of and destroy all unused containers, junk material and tyres, and to empty, scrub and dry desert coolers. The doctors also advised people to use bed nets at home and hospitals during dengue/zika virus fever to prevent mosquito bite.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dengue-death-toll-climbs-to-37-in-mohali-101636746827025.html
13-11-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh fully vaccinates 67% target population||The Union government has placed Chandigarh at the seventh position among all States and UTs when it comes to the second-dose coverage of the Covid-19 vaccine.“At 67%, Chandigarh’s second-dose coverage is seventh highest in the country, the Union ministry of health and family welfare has stated during the national immunisation day conference on Thursday,” said Dr Suman Singh, director, health services, Chandigarh.Around 8.4 lakh people are to be immunised in Chandigarh. As on Friday, 9,30,465 (110%) people, including migrants, have taken their first shot while 5,75,017 (68%) are fully vaccinated.The UT is performing much better than most states as the Centre had recently stated that only 38% of the country’s eligible beneficiaries had received both vaccine doses, while close to 79% have received at least one dose. With 100% coverage, Lakshadweep has topped the second-dose ranking. Lakshadweep was also the first among all States and UTs to achieve 100% first-dose coverage. Chandigarh was second. Other than these two, six States and UTs have already jabbed the eligible population with the first dose. 63K people skip 2nd jabAround 63,000 people, who have taken their first dose of Covid-19 vaccine from healthcare facilities in Chandigarh, have not turned up to take their second jab even after the completion of the recommended time gap. However, the number has come down from 75,526, as on October 28.“The health department has already started the ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ door-to-door Covid-19 vaccination campaign and we are motivating people to end the hesitancy and take the second dose. As per the central government’s CoWIN app, these people have missed their second dose despite a reminder message, which is automatically sent to the beneficiary once they are eligible for the second dose. The UT health department is now telephonically contacting these people and is conducting a special drive to vaccinate them at the earliest,” said Dr Suman Singh.Dr Singh said that when the teams were contacting these people, many were untraceable through phone calls. Many mobile numbers were changed while many people ignored the calls, she said, adding that the department is now tracing the addresses of those people through their Aadhaar numbers.According to medical experts, the first dose of vaccine helps in building antibodies, but without a booster dose, the antibodies are insufficient to fight the virus, especially with more deadly variants spreading fast. Even in the second wave of the pandemic, people who had just got their first dose were getting infected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-fully-vaccinates-67-target-population-101636746825508.html

Hence, moving an application for the same is nothing but a move to linger the investigation of the case,” they said.However, Anand Giri, who appeared before the court during the court proceedings through video conferencing, stated that he had no objection in giving his voice sample.After hearing both sides, CJM Harendra Nath said that the apex court in the case of Ritesh Sinha vs State of UP had held that if a request for voice sample is made during the investigation, the courts should accept it. Further, the accused has no objection in giving his voice sample. Besides, the investigating officer has stated that a voice sample would enhance the quality of the result of the investigation. “Hence, keeping in view the law laid down by the apex court and also the seriousness of the case, the CBI is permitted to take the voice sample of the accused, who is in judicial custody, as per the jail manual,” the order read while further extending the judicial remand of Anand Giri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/allahabad-cjm-allows-cbi-to-take-voice-sample-of-anand-giri-101636746526035.html

13-11-2021||Other||‘Palaayan’, sports won’t help BJP in West UP: Observers||Will issues of ‘Palaayan’ (escaping to save life) and pleasing youngsters by promoting an atmosphere of sports help the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) counter the farmers’ movement in western UP during the forthcoming Assembly election in the state?That’s the speculation doing rounds in the political corridors of western UP, where farmers are protesting against the three contentious farm bills for the past 11 months, under the Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU).During his visit to Kairana of Shamli district on November 8, chief minister Yogi Adityanath made an attempt to revive the issue of ‘Palaayan’ by meeting family members of those traders who had left the town and later returned. He also met family members of three traders who were killed in broad daylight by henchmen of Furqan and Mukeem Kala, in August 2014.Moving a step further, the CM announced financial assistance to the families of victims and assured them full support of the state government in providing security. “It was a matter of our pride and dignity”, he said while referring to the issue of ‘Palaayan’ and claimed that the situation turned during BJP’s rule and people returned to their home after criminals were dealt with.Home minister Amit Shah had also mentioned the issue of ‘Palaayan’ during his recent visit to Lucknow.BJP leader and the then MP from Kairana, Hukum Singh, had raised the issue of ‘Palaayan’ in 2016 and released a list of 340 families that had allegedly left Kairana town. The issue, however, became debatable when many families mentioned in the list denied leaving the town to an investigation team constituted by the then SP government and local administration.Political analyst Jamshed Zaidi explains that a few families left Kairana because of fear of criminal gangs and later Hukum Singh too realised it. “It was wrongly hyped as an ‘exodus’ which people themselves quelled by ensuring the defeat of Mriganka Singh in the 2017 Assembly election”, said Zaidi. Mriganka Singh is the daughter of Hukum Singh, who contested the Assembly election from Kairana in 2017 but lost to her rival SP candidate, Nahid Hasan.Later, in the 2018 Lok Sabha election, BJP fielded Pradeep Choudhary in Kairana constituency in place of Mriganka Singh, who wanted to contest on her father’s seat after his demise.Zaidi claims that under such circumstances ‘Palaayan’ won’t be a substantial issue for BJP to win elections but the party still wanted to try this earlier trusted issue for polarisation of votes. He believes that the farmers’ movement is now too deep-rooted and issues like ‘Palaayan’ won’t be able to either dilute or counter it in western UP. “Farmers are facing multiple issues of pending payment of sugarcane, demand to legalise MSP, withdrawal of three farm bills, high tariff of electricity, spiralling price of diesel, pesticides, fertilisers etc. Therefore issues like ‘Palaayan’ won’t be able to distract them,” Zaidi said.BJP’s Vyapaar Prakosth state convenor Vineet Sharda has different views on the issues. He said that why “should we think of countering the farmers’ movement. Farmers are our soul and the BJP government has done everything possible for their welfare.” He claimed that the BJP will form the government in the state with a thumping victory in the forthcoming elections.Samajwadi Party’s district president in Meerut, Rajpal Singh, however, said that they (BJP) has picked up the issue of ‘Palaayan’ again to divide people on the lines of religion ahead of the election with a motive to counter the effect of farmers’ movement in western UP. “They will not succeed in their wicked move to divide people,” Singh said.Western UP is also known for its affection for sports and it has produced many players of national and international repute. CM Yogi Adityanath felicitated medal winners of the Tokyo Paralympics in a grand function in Meerut on Thursday and distributed cash prizes to the tune of ₹32.50 crore to different medallists and those who represented the country in the Paralympics.During his address, Yogi shared the state’s new sports policy and how infrastructure is being developed to promote sports in the state.Leaders of rival parties opined that BJP’s declining popularity among youngsters in western UP might be behind the idea of projecting the party’s sports-friendly image by organising such a grand felicitation function to reach out sport-loving youngsters of the region.Rajpal Singh questioned inviting players of other states and giving them huge cash prizes from people’s tax money. “Their states should give them cash prizes and here they could be felicitated,” said Singh and described it a move of BJP to please youngsters. “But they might have forgotten that these youngsters are also sons and daughters of farmers whom the BJP has insulted and compelled to sit on the roads for over 11 months,” he said.BJP leader Vineet Sharda, however, said that sports has never been a political issue for BJP as it always believed in nurturing talent in sports and many sports schemes have been started to support and nurture sports in the country. “India bagged record medals at the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics because the BJP governments support sports,” Singh claimed.Political analyst Zaidi, however, believes that people are facing multiple problems due to inflation and other issues and glorifying sports through a much hyped event won’t do much for BJP, which wants to lure youngsters by projecting its sport-loving image in a region where youngsters have great affection for sports.He explained that sports is a major medium of getting jobs in the region and a majority of youngsters believe that the ruling government has failed to fulfil its promise of providing jobs.The BJP had a spectacular victory in 2014 Lok Sabha elections in the region. Party candidates won all 14 Lok Sabha seats in 14 districts of Meerut, Saharanpur and Moradabad divisions after fierce riots in Muzaffarnagar in 2013. The party contested Assembly elections in 2017 under similar situations but it could manage victory of its candidates in 51 out of 71 constituencies of Meerut, Moradabad and Saharanpur divisions. RLD failed to woo voters on its home turf and managed to win only Chaprauli seat and the Congress won two seats in Saharanpur district.Under the changed circumstances, because of ongoing farmers’ movement it’s a tough challenge for BJP to retain its seats in western UP. Therefore, party leaders are looking for issues which could appeal to voters and help the party show its strength in western UP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/palaayan-sports-won-t-help-bjp-in-west-up-observers-101636746047632.html

Sixty professionals and two amateurs made the cut.Tournament host Jeev Milkha Singh (75-72) missed the cut despite a steady even-par 72 in round two. He totaled three-over 147 for the week.Shiv, who admitted to being rusty at the start of the week having not played a tournament for about a month, seemed to have shaken off the rust as he maintained his position as the joint leader for the second straight day.The six-time international winner Kapur, who began his round from the 10th, had a scrappy start as he made pars on the first six holes. Shiv then found the hole from a range of seven to eight feet for his three consecutive birdies from the 16th through the 18th.On the front-nine, Kapur was steady with eight pars and a lone birdie on the sixth where he sank his longest putt of the day, a 15-footer.Two-time Asian Tour winner Rashid Khan jumped from overnight third to tied first. Rashid was one-under through the front-nine and then pushed ahead with a four-under on the back-nine. Rashid attributed his low score to his good course management. Aadil’s 65 brought him into contention. Aadil, who has just recovered from a wrist injury which kept him out of action from three PGTI events in September, sank a 40-footer for birdie on the 15th and converted four more birdies from a range of 10 to 15 feet.Delhi’s Kshitij Naveed Kaul produced a second consecutive 67 to occupy fourth place at 10-under 134.

Citing the information collected through RTI, Sabharwal said in the reply to an RTI application, the MC officials stated that ₹212 crore had been spent only on maintenance/repairs of the roads, which was surprising as the roads had been in a bad shape for the last few years.He had filed a complaint with the local bodies department and the vigilance department in February following which a vigilance inquiry was marked. The vigilance department has been demanding a report from the MC, but the officials have failed to submit the same, which points towards anomalies.“Now that I have filed a complaint and inquiry has been marked, the department is also not sharing the details regarding the amount spent on the maintenance of roads after 2020. It is a scam and the MC should submit the reports regarding the same. I have also written regarding the delay being made by the MC to senior officials of the local bodies department,” said Sabharwal.Meanwhile, MC additional commissioner Aaditya Dachalwal said the entire amount had not been spent on repairs, but it also included the amount of road reconstruction works and other maintenance works. A report regarding the same is being prepared and it will soon be submitted to the department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/road-repair-rti-activist-protests-failure-of-ludhiana-mc-to-submit-report-to-vigilance-department-101636745208144.html

On Thursday, the ED arrested Khaira and he was taken into custody by the central probe agency under provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The agency had raided his premises in March this year. He was produced in a PMLA court in Mohali and sent to the ED custody for a day. On Friday, the ED sought a remand for 13 days, but duty magistrate Ranjan Kumar Khullar ordered the remand for seven days.Khaira will be produced in the Mohali court on November 18 after his remand period ends, said Khaira’s son Mehtab Khaira, who is also an advocate. While coming out of the court, Khaira said he was “innocent” and termed the ED’s action as “total victimisation.” Khaira’s son also called his father’s arrest “unconstitutional and illegal.” The ED has alleged that Khaira was an “accomplice” of a drug case convicts and fake passport racketeers.The ED told the court they have to probe the source of funds that Khaira got from the US for the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in 2016. The ED said Khaira was issued notices four times, but he did not cooperate.Opposing the remand, Khaira’s lawyers Keshav Chaudhary and PS Walia pleaded that after the drug case, the ED summoned Khaira but they got stay from the Supreme Court. So, the ED couldn’t arrest him. Now, the ED filed a fresh case against Khaira, which is against the law. They also raised a question why hearing was going on in different courts instead of the ED court.Meanwhile, Khaira’s son alleged that his father had been framed in false cases. He said in 2017, his father was framed in an NDPS case as one of his supporters was arrested and was later sentenced to 20 years in jail. He said in the present case, Delhi chief minister and AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal had in 2016 asked Khaira to raise funds from NRIs living abroad. He said the ED had framed his father for bringing 1 lakh Canadian dollars and asked how anyone can bring such a huge amount from abroad. He said the ED, instead of checking the account of the AAP, was framing his father in the case which is “baseless”. Khaira won the assembly election in 2017 from the Bholath assembly seat in Kapurthala district on the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) ticket. He resigned from the primary membership of the Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP in January 2019 and floated his own outfit, Punjab Ekta Party. He then re-joined the Congress in June this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/money-laundering-case-khaira-sent-to-seven-day-ed-custody-101636744785369.html

The TRS’s decision to organise protests came amid an ongoing war of words between the TRS and BJP over paddy procurement and reducing VAT (value-added tax) on petrol and diesel.TRS president and Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, who sought procurement of the entire paddy grown in the State by the Centre, said on Sunday last that his party would raise the issue in Parliament besides holding dharnas in the districts.Rama Rao, attending a dharna in Sircilla, alleged that the Centre refused to procure paddy grown during the summer crop in the State. The summer crop yields parboiled rice.While the State government attempted to make farmers take up alternative crops in view of Centre’s reluctance to buy paddy, the State BJP president Bandi Sanjay Kumar sought to politicise the issue by asking farmers to go for paddy cultivation in the summer season, he said.Hitting out at Sanjay Kumar, Rama Rao, son of Chandrasekhar Rao, asked whether the TRS government is discouraging farmers to take up paddy cultivation even though the BJP-led Central government is ready to buy paddy from the State.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/trs-holds-protests-in-telangana-against-bjp-centre-over-paddy-procurement-from-state-101636743467461.html

13-11-2021||Bangalore||Seers call on CM Bommai seeking law against ‘forcible conversions’||Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Friday was seen sharing space with controversial rightwing leader Pramod Muthalik of the Sri Rama Sene in his official residence here.Muthalik was part of a delegation of Hindu seers who met Bommai and submitted a memorandum to bring in a legislation banning forcible conversions at the earliest.“Today (Friday) at chief minister’s official residence, over 50 Hindu seers, Sri Rama Sene, Hindu Janajagruthi Samithi members and others requested him to bring in a legislation to ban (religious) conversion,” the Hindu Janagagruthi Samithi said in a statement.The state government has already proposed to bring in a law to ban forcible conversions after the BJP’s Goolihatti Shekar made a passionate speech in the monsoon session of the state legislature held in September.Muthalik had made national headlines when his extreme rightwing organisation Sri Rama Sene had assaulted women in a pub in Mangaluru, about 350 km from Bengaluru, in 2009.Muthalik has since tried to stay in the headlines as his organisation has tried to protest against Valentine’s Day and other occasions in the garb of “protecting culture” and “resisting westernisation”.Sri Ram Sene was founded in the late 1960s by Kalki Maharaj, the right hand man of Shiv Sena leader Bal Thackeray, and a former member of the Bajrang Dal and Vishva Hindu Parishad. Muthalik held the top post in the organization and shot to infamy in the 2009 Mangaluru pub attacks.On January 24, 2009, a group of 40 activists of the Sene barged into a pub called “Amnesia — The Lounge” and trashed a group of young women and men, claiming the women were violating traditional Indian values. Two of the women were hospitalised.He has also tried to secure a BJP ticket to contest the assembly polls in Karnataka.In October, the rightwing leader said he was mobilising support to “reclaim” Gadag’s Jumma Masjid.“For 72 years we had to fight for Rama Mandir. After 72 years of struggle, we were able to complete our resolve to demolish it and construct a grand temple. In the same way in Gadag, I challenge that the place known as Jamma Masjid is actually Venkateswara Temple,” Muthalik said, HT reported on October 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/seers-call-on-cm-bommai-seeking-law-against-forcible-conversions-101636743285446.html
13-11-2021||Bangalore||Congress, BJP trade barbs over money laundering case||The Congress on Friday continued its attacks on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) senior leadership in the state over the alleged scandal of laundering money through crypto currencies.Priyank Kharge, the Congress legislator from Chittapur in Kalaburagi and former information technology minister, said chief minister Basavaraj Bommai brushed off allegations on the scandal calling it a ”non-issue” but then what was the need to brief the prime minister of the same. “If this (Bitcoin scandal) was a non-issue, what was the need to talk to the prime minister about it,” Kharge said.The legislator said the way in which the chief minister was talking on the issue appeared as though he was inviting others to “settle” the scam rather than uncover it. “This investigation is being done not to unravel the truth but to bury it. Because this is a big scandal. Maybe the first in the country involving bitcoin, cryptocurrencies,” Kharge said.The statements come when the Congress have been relentlessly trying to corner Bommai and other senior BJP leaders in the alleged scam, reportedly involving thousands of crores.While facts of the case continue to unravel in front of cameras, Kharge also placed before the media documents pertaining to the submissions made by Srikrishna or Sriki, a hacker, who is at the heart of the alleged scandal.He is currently out on bail and has feigned innocence in the entire episode.State Congress president DK Shivakumar said Bommai has been trying to be evasive during the entire episode.Referring to Bommai’s statement on Thursday, Shivakumar said the chief minister has conveyed that the prime minister asked him not to worry about the Bitcoin scandal. “Can there be smoke without fire?” Shivakumar said.Bommai had met Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday in Delhi. He had said Modi asked him not to worry about the alleged scandal even when the latter only tried bringing up the issue.The BJP is also hitting back at the Congress with their own version of the alleged scandal.“An investigation is already underway in the bitcoin issue. I have clarified all actions being taken by the government in this regard. But Congress leaders are unnecessarily creating a controversy. I have already said it (Congress) can present any specific evidence,” the BJP Karnataka unit said in a post on Twitter, attributing the quote to Bommai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/congress-bjp-trade-barbs-over-money-laundering-case-101636743045470.html
13-11-2021||Bangalore||Police filed ‘incomplete charge sheet’ in bitcoin scandal: Congress||The Congress on Friday accused Bengaluru police of filing an “incomplete charge sheet” against hacker Srikrishna Ramesh alias Sriki in the alleged bitcoin scandal.In a series of allegations, citing the charge sheet, the Congress said crucial evidence such as logs of hackers chats with his partners, recovered bitcoins and details of his bank transactions were missing from the charge sheet.HT, which has accessed the charge sheet and documents, had reported that 31 bitcoins seized allegedly from the hacker were missing from official records and there was a delay in reporting the hacker involvement in other crimes to the central agencies.During the interrogation, Srikrishna confessed to hacking into a cryptocurrency exchange -- Bitfinex, police claimed in the charge sheet. On August 2, 2016, hackers had breached the security systems of the exchange and stole around 120,000 bitcoins, which was about $72 million at the time. This case has caught the attention of the international enforcement agencies and India was flagged about the development as well.The hacker in question, Srikrishna, was arrested by the Central Crime Branch (CCB) of police on November 17, 2020, in a drug peddling case. He had allegedly bought drugs from international dealers using bitcoins on the dark web. In the interrogation that followed, CCB found that the software engineer was also involved in a series of online crimes. He confessed to hacking and stealing from three Bitcoin exchanges, 14 company websites, including 10 poker websites, and a government portal.An examination of the charge sheet also pointed out that the voluntary statement filed by Bengaluru police in the charge sheet didn’t have relevant details, including the date on which the statement was recorded. Even though the hacker had claimed he was involved in crimes involving the hacking of certain international Bitcoin exchanges, police investigation was limited to the hacking of certain poker websites in the country.In a statement issued on Friday, the Congress said even though police records show that the hacker was arrested on November 17, he had surrendered before police on November 14. The Congress claimed he was in illegal custody for three days before his arrest was registered.The Congress also alleged that the hacker was illegally drugged by police while he was in custody. “On January 11, 2021, when Srikrishna is produced in a court, his father Gopal Ramesh filed an application under Sec 190(1)(c) accuses police and joint commissioner to having illegally administering Alprazolam (am anxiety drug) on Srikrishna. Srikrishna agreed that he has had Alprozolam during police custody in front of the magistrate,” Congress said.HT accessed the petition filed by the Srikrishna’s father, which read: “…application was filed by the petitioner being the father of the accused that he has credible and reliable information that the respondents (police) at the behest and unlawful orders have been administering the Petitioner’s son Srikrishna with excessive mind-altering drugs specifically Alprazolam which is a prohibited drug and therefore, sought cognizance be taken against all officials who have committed various offences under the NDPS Act as also under the IPC.”The opposition went to allege even though the magistrate ordered a scientific examination of the hacker’s blood and urine samples, police conducted a stomach wash done on him, defying the order. The opposition also produced a document from Victoria Medical College that read that stomach cleaning performed “to rule out poisoning”.The Congress also accused Bengaluru police of misappropriation in handling the bitcoins allegedly seized during the investigation. Quoting a press note released by Bengaluru police on January 12, the Congress said 31 bitcoins worth ₹9 crore were seized by police during the probe.According to the statement, police had accessed the bitcoin wallet of Srikrishna and changed the password of the wallet. As per police records, there were 31 bitcoins in the wallet at the time of the “panchanama”. “Where are the 31.8 bitcoins as shown in the screenshot of Panchanama of Crime No 45/2020? Since it is not withdrawn to the police wallet, who has them now? asked the Congress.Alleging there was an intentional delay in informing the Enforcement Directorate and the Central Bureau of Investigation and Interpol, the Congress alleged that police waited for more than three months to inform central agencies despite having a voluntary statement from Srikrishna claiming he has than 5,000 cryptocurrencies with him. “A statutory govt orders states that all cases related to economic offences falling outside the jurisdiction of the state should be informed to higher authorities,” said the party.Further pointing out the loopholes in the charge sheet filed by Bengaluru police, the Congress alleged that the charge sheet filed by police was intentionally incomplete. “None of the Skype chats, Facebook chats, logs are mentioned in the charge sheet. Despite having more than 100 days of police custody, police have not recovered any of the hacked bitcoins.”It went on to add the hacker confession in the statement that he had transferred 80,000 euros was neither investigated, nor reported to Enforcement Directorate. “Facebook chats on drug trafficking were neither investigated nor reported to Narcotics Control Bureau. The charge sheet doesn’t have any mention of the 5,000 bitcoins (worth 2,500 crore as of today), which the hacker claims to have hacked. There is no tracking done on the amount transferred to bank accounts from hacking E-Procurement Website of Karnataka government,” the Congress alleged.Senior officers of Bengaluru police rebutted claims of the Congress. Presenting their versions, two senior police officers said several claims made by the hacker in his voluntary statement couldn’t be verified during the investigation, which is being highlighted by the opposition.A senior Bengaluru police officer, who didn’t want to be named, said although Srikrishna had told police about his involvement, it could not be corroborated. “Yes, in his voluntary statement (copy of which is available with HT), Sriki has claimed a lot of things including being part of the Bitfinex hacking and transferring funds etc. We were not able to verify this information, so it was not communicated to authorities during early stages of investigation. We were trying to get more evidence.”The officer said police could only find evidence of his involvement in the hacking of some poker companies and the government portal.Another senior officer said he had done an evidence collection in presence of two experts, who had changed login details of an account, where Srikrishna showed 31 bitcoins. “Several days later, we realised the seized account didn’t belong to Sriki. We have submitted all these details before the court. I don’t understand why there is a controversy over this,” said the officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/police-filed-incomplete-charge-sheet-in-bitcoin-scandal-congress-101636742805258.html

13-11-2021||Delhi||Police unearth pension scam in Delhi govt department, 6 held||The Delhi Police crime branch on Friday said they had unearthed a widow and disabled persons pension scam involving the Delhi government’s social welfare, women and child development office at south Delhi’s Lajpat Nagar, after arresting six people, including four contractual employees of the department.The arrested persons were allegedly involved in preparing false and forged disability as well as death certificates for sanctioning monthly pension to ineligible persons. One of them, identified as 35-year-old Riyasat, was drawing a disability pension for himself while his wife had been drawing a widow pension, the police said.Police said the racket was in operation for nearly two years and, during this period, monthly pensions had been sanctioned to over 300 people on the basis of forged disability and death certificates. Many instances of disability pension sanctioned to multiple people on the same person’s disability certificate as well as pension sanctioned to women beneficiaries on the basis of a man’s disability certificate have also been found during the investigation. The crime branch said it also received information of a similar scam at the department office in northeast Delhi. “We have seized 36 passbooks that mention the credited pension money, 180 online applications for disability pensions, 117 copies of Aadhaar cards related to approved widow pensions, and a list of 136 persons who are already obtaining pensions on the basis of forged disability certificates,” said deputy commissioner of police (crime) Monika Bhardwaj.The other arrested persons were identified as Sahil,30, Balram alias Balraj,33, Mubarak,37, Rajesh Kumar, 25, and Jai Prakash,33. While Riyasat and Sahil were private persons who arranged candidates for the pension schemes, the other four men worked as contractual employees at the social welfare, women and child development department’s office at Lajpat Nagar.Riyasat and Sahil charged between ₹10,000 and ₹15,000 from each applicant for helping him or her in getting the pension sanctioned by using forged documents. The arrested contractual employees were getting money from the duo for clearing the files and sanctioning the pension, said DCP Bhardwaj.Police said that the scam came to the fore after a woman filed a complaint, alleging that two persons named Riyasat and Yunus (father of Sahil) were running private offices in Jaitpur and sanctioning window and disability pensions on the Delhi government’s behalf. The woman told the police that during the first Covid-19 lockdown, her husband stopped working because of the pandemic and it led to a financial crisis in her family. She went to their office and asked for financial help.Riyasat and Yunus, who is a social worker, told her that the Delhi government is running a scheme through which she could get ₹2,500 every month. They took her Aadhaar card, Pan card and two photos for registration. Riyasat and Yunus’s son Sahil told her that she will have to pay ₹15,000 them as processing charge after the money is credited to her account, the police said.“From January 2021, ₹2,500 started coming into her account. She would withdraw the money and gave it to the duo as promised. Later, she learnt that the amount was being credited on account of Delhi government’s Vidhva Pension Yojna (Widow Pension Scheme) despite her husband being alive. She enquired into the matter and found that many people in her neighbourhood were fraudulently getting similar amounts of money. She approached us and filed a complaint. After thorough investigation, we have arrested six men for running the scam,” added DCP Bhardwaj.Explaining the syndicate’s modus operandi, the DCP said that Riyasat and Sahil also hired agents who lured people in need and convinced them to apply for the pension schemes. Those who agreed for were taken to the offices of the duo who then directed them to deposit their IDs and other documents required for registering for the schemes.“Before applying for the schemes, the applicants were told that the dup would keep the pension for the first 10 months, as they were helping them get the pension,” added Bhardwaj.Riyasat’s interrogation revealed that after his father’s death three years ago, he and his mother had visited the Lajpat Nagar office of the district officer of women and child development to apply for her widow pension. During the time he met Sahil who cleared the pension scheme files with the help of Balraj and Mubarak. He requested Sahil to get his disability pension cleared and his wife’s widow pension. Sahil took ₹14,000 from him and Riyasat’s files for both the schemes and cleared them. Thereafter, Riyasat also started his own office and hired local women as his agents to collect applications from people in their neighbourhood, the police said.The Delhi government condemned the misuse of government credentials.“A thorough investigation must be conducted if such an incident has been reported. Misuse of government credentials in such a manner is a highly condemnable act. The police should proceed with their own investigation and the concerned department, too, will conduct an intricate enquiry into the matter. The Delhi government had issued strict directions to the directors concerned to verify each and every case properly as well as crosscheck the validation of all the life certificates every year to prevent such misuse,” said a Delhi government spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/police-unearth-pension-scam-in-delhi-govt-department-6-held-101636742385255.html
13-11-2021||Mumbai||Fifteenth accused in cruise drug bust case gets bail||A special Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS) court on Friday granted bail to Gurugram resident Mohak Jaiswal, who was arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) in the Cordelia Cruise drugs bust case. Of the 20 people arrested in the case, Jaiswal has become the 15th accused to get bail.Special NDPS judge VV Patil granted Jaiswal bail on a personal bond of ₹50,000. Jaiswal was also directed to visit the NCB office every Monday.Advocate Lakshmi Raman, who appeared for Jaiswal, had argued that there was no recovery from him, and as other accused in the case were already granted bail on the grounds of parity, he too, should be given bail. Raman also submitted that section 27A of NDPS Act (punishment for financing illicit trafficking and harbouring offenders) was not applicable to Mohak as he had not financed any co-accused to help support an illegal organisation or the business of drug trafficking. The counsel argued that investigation was completed and the allegations against the accused were vague and no direct role was attributed to Jaiswal.Raman submitted that even if the entire case of prosecution was to be taken as “Gospel truth”, Jaiswal had only committed an offence for facilitating procurement of intermediary quantity of ecstasy pills for the co-accused and there is no material on record to show that he had committed any offence involving commercial quantity of contraband.After arresting Jaiswal on October 3 along with other accused – Bollywood star Shahrukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan, Arbaaz Merchant, Munmun Dhamecha, Vikrant Chokkar, Ishmeet Singh Chadha, Gomit Chopra and Nupur Satija – NCB had alleged that the ecstasy pills recovered from Satija were given by Jaiswal.Based on the leads given by Jaiswal, the agency had arrested a man named Abdul Kadir Shaikh, 30, from Jogeshwari and had recovered commercial quantity of 54.3g of mephedrone and 2.5g of ecstasy from him.Jaiswal’s bail application was initially rejected by a metropolitan magistrate court, after which he applied before the NDPS court.Based on a tip-off that a rave party was scheduled on the ship off the Mumbai coast, an NCB team led by zonal director Sameer Wankhede raided the Goa-bound Cordelia cruise on the evening of October 2. Aryan was granted bail by the Bombay high court on October 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/fifteenth-accused-in-cruise-drug-bust-case-gets-bail-101636742026466.html

When we don’t know how many stray dogs are in the city how can we know how many stray dogs have to be sterilised,” said Mitra.To make the census more effective and humane, Chandigarh MC will opt for non-invasive techniques for the census. “We are exploring different non-invasive method of counting the animals.” Currently, invasive method is generally used wherein ears or other parts of the animals being counted are physically tagged.The last census was done in 2019, which had shown an increase in stray dog population by 65% within seven years from 2012. While the number of stray dogs stood at 7,847 in the census conducted in 2012, it reached 12,900 in 2019.Before the last census, even the Punjab and Haryana high court had ordered a fresh survey of stray dogs in Chandigarh in August 2018.The increase in stray dog population had put a question mark over Chandigarh MC’s sterilisation efforts, which had started in 2015. This is despite, the MC claims of sterilising more than 20,000 dogs since 2015.Similar questions are being raised over Chandigarh MC’s efforts at present too as city residents face increasing number of dog bite cases. Last year, around 28 dog-bite cases per day were reported in the city. A total of 10,558 persons were bitten by dogs last year.Resident welfare associations have raised their doubts over the number of the sterilisation being carried out by the Chandigarh MC. They have repeatedly demanded getting them involved in the sterilisation process.Rajesh Kumar, a resident of Sector 38, said, “Whenever the Chandigarh MC conducts the sterilisation drive in a sector, it should inform the residents about it so that they can also give their inputs as to which areas are most effected. This will also give confidence to residents that the drive is being carried out properly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-mc-to-carry-out-to-fresh-census-to-deal-with-stray-dog-menace-101636742025217.html
13-11-2021||Mumbai||Sought court nod to take KP Gosavi’s statement: NCB official||The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) deputy director general (northern region) Gyaneshwar Singh, who is leading a departmental vigilance probe into the extortion allegations against NCB Mumbai zonal director Sameer Wankhede, and four other officers, said on Friday that the team has sought the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) court’s permission to record the statement of KP Gosavi, an independent witness in the cruise ship drug raid case. The five-member special enquiry team arrived in Mumbai on October 27, four days after Prabhakhar Sail, an independent witness in the cruise ship raid and an employee of Gosavi, released a notarised affidavit claiming that Wankhede was part of an extortion attempt of ₹25 crore.Gosavi was arrested by the Pune police on October 28 in connection with a 2018 cheating case. On Thursday, a different police station in Pune took custody of Gosavi in a separate case. “We approached the court for recording the statement of Gosavi, who in the custody of Pune police in a cheating case registered against him in 2018,” Singh told reporters gathered outside the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) office in Bandra, Mumbai, on Friday. He added that more people will be called in to record their statement based on what Gosavi said.Wankhede had conducted a raid on a cruise ship, Cordelia, docked off the coast of Mumbai, on October 2, following which 20 persons were arrested including Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son, Aryan (23). Wankhede was removed from the investigation — but retained his position and continued to assist in the case — after the vigilance team began its probe.In the affidavit, Sail claimed to have overheard a phone call between Gosavi and a certain Sam D’Souza. “You put a bomb of 25 crores and let’s settle at 18 final, because we have to give 8 crores to Sameer Wankhede,” Gosavi reportedly said, the affidavit stated. “The vigilance team has recorded statements of 15 people, including Sameer Wankhede, VV Singh and three other NCB officers who were present at the October 2 raid. There are few important witnesses who need to be examined and we will record their statements soon,” Singh said.He said that the team has also questioned 10 other people including Sailand the lawyer who notarised the affidavit. “The team has procured electronic and documentary evidence," Singh said.  “We have visited the crime scene and reconstructed events. Mumbai police has cooperated with us. They have assured their support. We have gathered a few CCTV evidence during enquiry,” he added.Aryan Khan questioned by NCBA separate NCB special investigation team (SIT) constituted to investigate the cruise ship raid case interrogated Aryan Khan on Friday.Aryan also visited the NCB office in south Mumbai to mark his weekly attendance as per the bail condition set by the Bombay high court,which granted him bail on October 28.The SIT headed by deputy director general Sanjay Singh, was formed on November 5 to investigate the cruise drug bust case and five other cases including one involving Sameer Khan, the son-law of state minister Nawab Malik, who has alleged that the October 2 raid was an attempt to “kidnap” Aryan for “ransom” and Wankhede was purportedly part of this plot. Aryan visited NCB office for the first time after he was released from Arthur Road jail on October 30, after spending 22 days in custody. Earlier, the SIT had summoned Aryan and co-accused Arbaaz Merchant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sought-court-nod-to-take-kp-gosavi-s-statement-ncb-official-101636741725125.html
13-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi schools prohibit some activities, attendance drops||Attendance has begun falling amid growing concerns that the worsening air quality can impact the health of children, the administrators of several schools have said, barely a fortnight after children began in-person learning after a gap of over one-and-a-half years.Children are among the most vulnerable to air pollution, which is at its worst – the air quality index was at 471 at 3pm and the concentrations of poisonous PM2.5 particulate matter has been above the “emergency” threshold of 300 micrograms per cubic metre of air since 1am on Friday. PM2.5 pollutants, which are now over five times the safe limit, can penetrate deep into the lungs and lead to lasting health damage.Parents are now worried students will be more vulnerable to respiratory diseases. “Parents in Delhi are facing two kinds of dilemma. First are existing concerns of Covid-19 infection and now it is the severe air quality. Many schools are still holding unit tests and parents are forced to send their children to school despite not wanting to. Many children have asthma, allergies, or even allergic bronchitis which worsens during the pollution season. Going to school in such a scenario is harmful to their health but there is little that parents can do,” said Aprajita Gautam, president of the Delhi Parents’ Association.A Commission for Air Quality Management(CAQM) sub-committee, after a meeting on Friday, advised citizens to limit outdoor activities and exposure. The Delhi Disaster Management Authority, which issues guidelines pertaining to Covid-19, has encouraged schools to continue with online learning. Several schools said they are working on reducing the number of classes and in-person lessons till the pollution levels are in control. “We had resumed in-person classes only for classes 9 to 12 so far and classes 6 to 8 will start on Monday. Even in middle school, less than 50% of the parents agreed to send their children to school due to several factors including pollution. While deciding on reopening, we had kept various factors in mind including the pollution levels and the Covid-19 situation after Diwali,” said Madhulika Sen, senior adviser at Tagore International School, where several parents approach school authorities thanking them for not reopening completely. The school is planning to reopen for nursery to class 5 in January and is holding staggered in-person only for the middle school and senior section. School administrators said they have limited some activities but closing schools may not be on the radar for now. “We have reduced physical activities such as yoga and others in our playground. But when children have come back to school after nearly 20 months, it would not be prudent to close schools and send them back home. We are not planning on closing schools for now because addressing the learning gap is extremely important right now,” said Sudha Acharya, the chairperson of the National Progressive Schools’ Conference which has over 120 top Delhi schools under it. Schools have reduced the duration for which students would have to stay on school premises, she added. Laksh Vir Sehgal, principal of Bal Bharati Public School, GRH Marg, said, “The attendance in classes 4 and 5 is around 20-25%. The dip in air quality affects the health of children and in the previous years too, if the pollution levels increased, the attendance would decrease. This time around the attendance is low across all classes and the pollution levels are one of the reasons among it along with Covid-19 concerns. Since schools are working for a shorter period of time, there are no outdoor activities and we are ensuring that students say in the classrooms.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-schools-prohibit-some-activities-attendance-drops-101636741066406.html
13-11-2021||Gurugram||Namaz in open disrupted again, this time in Gurugram’s Sirhaul||Protesters on Friday disrupted namaz (Friday prayers) being offered at a park in Sirhaul village in Sector 18, one of 20 sites designated by the district administration last week for the purpose. However, no violence or untoward incident took place and the situation was soon brought under control, the police later said. According to the police, about 100 members of Manavta Sanghatan, a Hindu outfit involved in “social service”, and area residents gathered at the park carrying the tricolour and chanting religious slogans. A senior police officer, who was present at the spot, said when locals objected to the namaz being offered in the open, the Muslims shifted to another spot nearby. “The situation was soon controlled,” he said, asking not to be named.Protests against namaz in the open in Gurugram have been going on since September. They began in Sector 47 and then spread to Sector 12A. Last Friday, Hindu groups organised a Govardhan Puja at the spot in Sector 12A, where namaz used to be offered.In light of the continued protests, the district administration formed a committee comprising representatives of both communities and officials from the police and the administration last month to resolve the issue. The committee, in consultation with imams, identified 20 public places for Friday prayers last week, including the one in Sirhaul where the prayers were disrupted.On Friday, most Muslims chose to offer prayers at Sector 57 mosque, after the number of public sites for namaz was reduced from 37 to 20 last week. Namaz was not offered at any of the sites where objections were raised earlier, said officials of district administration on Friday, adding that the payers were only disrupted in Sirhaul, while they were held peacefully at the other 19 designated sites.Praveen Yadav (33), a resident leading the protest in Sirhaul, said Muslims encroached on parks in the area to pray despite repeated requests by residents to not do so. Sachin Yadav (32), a resident of the village and another protester, said, “We will not allow them to offer prayers in any of the parks. Either they should go to mosques or do it on Waqf board land. If they come here again, things may get ugly.”The protestors said a park is a public place and people of nearby areas visit it all day. “Many private companies are located close to the park and people working in these companies visit the park during lunch break and residents also spend time in the park during winters. We are not against the offering of prayers but we won’t allow it in the open,” said Praveen.Rajiv Mittal, a member of Sanyukt Hindu Sangharsh Samiti, an umbrella body of several Hindu outfits, said they have given a call to oppose namaz in public places and now people are doing so on their own. “Today, namaz was opposed by local residents of Sirhaul village,” he said.Responding to the latest disruption, members of the Muslim community said they were being harassed by protesters every week. “After facing issues in Sector 47 and Sector 12A, we shifted our prayers to other sites, but people are after us and are intentionally harassing us. Police and the administration should take action against them,” said Altaf Ahmad, a member of Gurgaon Nagrik Ekta Manch, a citizens’ platform, and spokesperson for Gurgaon Muslim Council.He said the administration has already reduced the prayer sites from 37 to 20, and land should be allotted to them so that they can set up mosques and not offer prayers in the open. “It seems that the disruptions will not end unless the government assigns us land where we can pray with dignity,” he said.Ahmad said locals of Sector 12A have taken over the erstwhile namaz site and have smeared the spot with cow dung to dissuade any attempt to hold the prayers there.Khurshid Rajaka, chairman of Muslim Rashtriya Manch and member of Haryana Waqf Board, said, “Establishing peace should be the priority, not politics.”An official of the district administration said if residents oppose namaz at a particular site, then the site will be changed. “Namaz will be offered at places where residents have no objection. Maintaining law and order is our priority,” said the official, asking not to be named.Police had earlier issued a statement saying that permission for namaz at a designated site could be withdrawn if residents of the area continued to raise objections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/namaz-in-open-disrupted-again-this-time-in-gurugram-s-sirhaul-101636740825341.html
13-11-2021||Delhi||GK’s busy M-Block market to get biggest car parking lot in South Delhi||The M-block market in Greater Kailash 1 is set to get the biggest automated car-parking facility run by the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) as the standing committee on Friday cleared the proposal for the project, which can accommodate up to 399 vehicles, that will be undertaken at an estimated cost of ₹63.74 crore. The parking facility will be a seven storey structure with the provision to accommodate 57 cars on each floor.Chairman of the standing committee Col (retd) B K Oberoi said the car-parking facility in the key South Delhi market is the biggest automated parking project being undertaken by the SDMC. “In 2017, a proposal was made to set up a car-parking facility that can accommodate upto 200 vehicles. But, we have decided to double the capacity in the current project to meet future needs,” said Oberoi. In the last one year, SDMC has operationalised three automated parking projects in Green Park, Lajpat Nagar and Adhchini. A senior engineering official from the SDMC said that the agency, design and the rates that will be charged at the new parking facility have been finalised and once approved by the standing committee, the work order will be issued. Since the BJP has a majority in both the standing committee and the south municipality, the project is expected to sail through. “Since the automated parking projects are based on steel structure-based modules, which can be assembled relatively faster than the RCC (reinforced concrete cement) based structures, we are expecting to complete the project in a year to maximum 18 months. In the shuttle parking system, the dolly which carries the vehicle uses RCC slabs,” said the official. The parking facility at the M-block in Greater Kailash 1 will be the first “shuttle system”based automated car parking by the SDMC. The Green Park automated parking project is based on ‘tower parking’ model while the ones in Lajpat Nagar and Adhchini were based on “puzzle parking” concept. A senior municipal official explained the shuttle system permits both horizontal as well as vertical movement of the platforms carrying the vehicle. “The user leaves the vehicle at a designated spot. The automated parking system will select the floor as well as the available vacant spot on that floor where the vehicle can be parked. All the information will be available in the card that will be given to the user,” explained the official. Rajender Sharda, who heads M-block GK1 market association, said the market urgently needs a parking solution as there are frequent traffic jams. “The vehicles of shoppers often spill over on to the road. The new parking facility will help meet our needs; the SDMC should focus on timely completion of the project,” he added.In a letter to the standing committee dated October 22, 2021, municipal commissioner Gyanesh Bharti wrote that the M-block market is prone to traffic congestion as it is one of the affluent markets in the south zone. “The market is visited by a large number of shoppers resulting in traffic jams on day-to-day basis due to lack of sufficient parking space. The existing surface parking capacity is about 80 cars which is insufficient to cater to demand of parking,” said the letter by Bharti.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/gks-busy-m-block-market-to-get-biggest-car-parking-lot-in-south-delhi-101636736264980.html
13-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Man held for sending threats, extortion messages to friend’s in-laws||A 21-year-old man was arrested for allegedly conniving with his friend and sending threats, abuses and extortion messages to the latter’s husband and in-laws using different fake international WhatsApp numbers that they had created using a mobile application, police said on Friday.An iPhone used in the crime was recovered from the suspect, identified as Shahbaaz, by the northeast district’s cyber cell that registered the case and arrested him on Tuesday, police said.The woman is yet to be arrested as investigators are looking into her role in the crime, said deputy commissioner of police (northeast) Sanjay Kumar Sain.According to police, Shahbaaz, who was pursuing a teaching course after graduation, said that the woman allegedly wanted to harass her in-laws after she started living separately due to the differences. She confided in Shahbaaz her problems and he allegedly decided to help her in harassing them.He also allegedly sent threats and indecent messages to the fiancé of the woman’s sister-in-law as a result of which they broke up.DCP Sain said that the crime came to light after one Imran, from Bhagirathi Vihar, filed alleging that he and his family members were receiving threats, abuses and extortion messages from different international WhatsApp numbers. “The district cyber cell team collected details of the WhatsApp numbers and found that all of them were operated through the same mobile phone. Through technical investigation, the suspect was identified as Shahbaaz and he was arrested,” said Sain.During the interrogation, the DCP said, Shahbaaz allegedly admitted that he and the woman downloaded an app to generate duplicate WhatsApp numbers and used them to send the threats and abusive messages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiman-held-for-sending-threats-extortion-messages-to-friend-s-inlaws-101636736024827.html
13-11-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab elections: AAP releases first list of 10 candidates||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Friday released its first list of 10 candidates for the Punjab assembly elections to be held early next year. All 10 are sitting legislators who have been fielded from their present seats. Also read: Canada set to welcome record number of permanent residents from IndiaAAP legislature party leader Harpal Singh Cheema has been fielded from Dirba assembly constituency, whereas his deputy Saravjit Kaur Manuke will contest from Jagraon. Jai Kishan Rori has been named from Garhshankar, Manjeet Bilaspur from Nihal Singh Wala, Kultar Singh Sandhwan from Kotkapura, Baljinder Kaur from Talwandi Sabo, Budhram from Budhlada, Aman Arora from Sunam, Gurmeet Singh Meet Hayer from Barnala and Kulwant Pandori from Mehal Kalan, according to the list released by AAP state unit chief Bhagwant Mann and Punjab affairs in-charge Jarnail Singh. All 10 are first-time legislators. Red-faced after Ruby joins Congress and Hissowal praises CM The party released the list after its sitting MLA from Bathinda Rural (reserved), Rupinder Kaur Ruby, jumped ship to join the Congress on Wednesday and then Jagtar Singh Jagga Hissowal, who represents Raikot (reserved) seat, openly endorsed chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi in the state assembly. Though Hissowal later said he is not joining the Congress, his actions have left the AAP leadership red-faced. After Ruby quit the AAP, Harpal Cheema had stated that she was not going to get the AAP ticket and had, therefore, joined the Congress. Both Ruby and Hissowal had backed party leader Sukhpal Singh Khaira when he rebelled against the AAP leadership. Five years on, down from 20 to 11 AAP MLAs In 2017, the AAP won 20 seats, but its effective strength has now depleted to 11, with five MLAs, including Khaira, joining the Congress. While HS Phoolka has quit politics, Kanwar Sandhu is under suspension. The remaining two, Baldev Singh and Amarjit Sandoa, have been in and out of the party and their candidature has not been announced. Baldev Singh was disqualified from the state assembly last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-elections-aap-releases-first-list-of-10-candidates-101636709265709.html
13-11-2021||Chandigarh||China building troops along LAC in Himachal districts: Police report||hina has been building up troops along the 240-km stretch of the Line of Actual Control adjoining Kinnaur and Lahaul and Spiti districts of Himachal Pradesh over the past year besides accelerating the construction of roads, bridges and helipads in the area, a report prepared by Himachal Pradesh police has said.In the report, addressed to state governor Rajendra Arlekar, the police have cited the troop buildup and rapid construction of infrastructure along nine passes on the LAC in the two remote districts. HT has a copy of the presentation made by HP police to the Governor. “During the past year, China has increased the presence of People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and improved its infrastructure and surveillance capability along the border with Himachal Pradesh,” state director general of police Sanjay Kundu said in Shimla on Friday.Kinnaur and Lahaul and Spiti districts share a 240-km boundary with China. This comprises an 80km stretch in Chumar in Lahaul and Spiti and 160km from Daroti to Mumri Dogri in Kinnaur district.India and China have hardened their stance on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, going by increased military activities on both sides of the boundary, infrastructure development, surveillance and combat manoeuvres by their armies in the midst of the ongoing border standoff in the sensitive sector, HT reported on November 8, four weeks after military talks to cool Ladakh tensions reached an impasse. Military talks are unlikely to result in a breakthrough and only higher intervention can show the way to resolving the 18-month-old border crisis, that report added.PLA building personnel’s accommodationThe state police report said China is building a new road in Churup from the north bank of the Pareechu river to the new hinterland. It has stepped up construction in the border villages of Shaktot, Churup and Dunmur.China has set up new posts equipped with high-quality surveillance equipment besides new buildings in Churup village, the report based on inputs from local police patrolling units added.The PLA has accelerated construction between Manja and Shangrangla around its permanent base at Rando village near Lapcha Pass. The movement of heavy machinery and vehicles has been reported in this area, the report said.It added the Chinese army is building accommodation for military personnel in the Lapcha Pass area, which was traditionally used for travel by Tibetan people and local traders. The report also mentioned that China has stocked up construction material at Kyuk village and built new barracks for troops in the Lapshak region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/china-building-up-troops-infrastructure-along-himachal-border-101636704403033.html
13-11-2021||Mumbai||Plastic pollution: A crisis in Mumbai’s beaches and the Arabian Sea||Between his work as a fisher hauling catch in the early hours of the day from August to October and a gig as a lifeguard with the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM), 26-year-old Sanjay Bamaniya, a resident of Sagar Kutir, Versova, has little time for fun.But, whenever he can, he surfs. Well-built and athletic, Bamaniya is a keen swimmer — he was part of a civic body operation that saved the lives of two boys who almost drowned during the recent Ganesh Chaturthi visarjan near Versova koliwada — and he has grown up with the ocean a walking distance from his front door. When he hits the waves at Juhu and Versova beaches he is undeterred by the pollution and debris that Mumbai pours into the sea every day, he said. “Surfing is incredible. Early on, I taught myself to float on my stomach using large sheets of thermocol and travel with the waves. About three or four years ago I finally acquired a surfboard and now I do it quite regularly with a friend,” he said. Had it not been for the large thermocol sheets floating around Versova beach, Bamaniya would have never learnt to surf. But the irony is not lost on him – Thermocol is one of the most common plastic pollutants in Mumbai’s coastline and it poses a larger threat to Bamaniya’s livelihood. “Sometimes, at high tide during monsoon months, there’s so much plastic floating on the water you can’t possibly go swimming or surfing,” Bamaniya said. “When hauling fish, we end up with several kilos of plastic waste in the nets. It can take hours to segregate the waste from the catch before going to market. We end up spending a lot of money and time fixing our nets; sharp bits of plastic can get tangled in them or even cut them open,” he said.A sea of plasticThermocol, or expanded polystyrene (EPS), is one of several varieties of plastic that can be found along Mumbai’s shoreline. A recent research conducted by Helen White, an oceanographer at Haverford College in Pennsylvania, United States of America, found that polystyrene comprised about 16% of plastic debris collected from three beaches of Mumbai: Juhu, Mahim, Ambojwadi in Malad.Polyvinyl Chloride, or PVC — typically used to make drainage pipes, medical devices and insulation for power cables among others — made up 40% of the debris. Polyethylene Terephthalate or PET — usually found in food and beverage packaging — made up 17%. Trace amounts of Polyvinyl Acetate (PVA; 1%), acetal (1%) and silicon (1%) — components which have a wide range of application as industrial adhesives and in the manufacture of consumer electronics — were also found.These results are based on analysis of nearly 1,200 plastic samples that were collected at random from the above three locations in Mumbai between 2018 and 2020. White presented these findings as part of a trans-disciplinary collaboration entitled Inhabited Seas, where natural and social science researchers, architects and designers across the US and India studied various aspects of Mumbai’s urban design in the context of its geographical location, as a coastal city, and its rains.That there is a crisis isn’t new information. But it took another catastrophic event to push this crisis into the limelight.On May 17, an Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm with windspeeds between 150kmph and 160kmph made a landfall on the Gujarat coast leaving a trail of destruction behind. Lakhs of people were evacuated along the Konkan coast, and property worth several lakhs was damaged. As the storm intensified over the days before it made landfall, an accommodation barge off the coast of Mumbai broke free and sank. Another tugboat got caught in the swirling waters and went under. The Indian Navy launched a search and rescue operation almost immediately but at least 88 of the 274 people couldn’t be rescued. On June 30, the Bombay high court expressed grave concern over another aftermath of the cyclone. A bench comprising the Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni said that several newspaper reports had pointed to the amount of trash that the sea had regurgitated on Mumbai’s beaches and promenades. These reports painted a “very sorry picture with regard to the cleaning of the coast,” the bench observed.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) told the court that it had collected 153 metric tonnes (MT) of waste, mostly plastic, from the city’s seven beaches the day after Tauktae passed Mumbai. That’s how much 51 elephants put together on a scale would weigh.The exact quantum of the plastic polluting Mumbai’s shoreline, however, is hard to know. In a paper published by the Elsevier Journal Science of the Total Environment in August last year, a group of researchers from ICAR-Central Institute of Fisheries Education (CIFE) found that north-east Arabian Sea, just off Mumbai, contained an estimated 379 MT of marine debris of which plastics contributed to 40.6% of the total by weight. The rest consisted of varying proportions of “metal, glass, rubber, wood/paper, cloth/fibre and others (small degraded particles and natural debris like branches of a tree, coconut, etc),” the paper stated. The researchers used a technique called swept area method, where the ocean is trawled at selected sampling locations to collect data, which is then used to arrive at a metric called the mean catch per unit area or CPUA. The group conducted 25 trawls between September 2017 and May 2018, collecting 1,107 items of marine debris. Plastics items comprised 87% of it. “Among this, plastic bags and food wrappers were dominant,” the study noted.The mean CPUA of marine debris in Mumbai’s water was estimated at 22.4 kg per square kilometre of the ocean, though this method has its limitations as small objects like bottle caps, loose fibers and cigarette butts are not always caught in trawl nets. The researchers used this number to calculate the quantum of marine debris in the study area — 379MT.So what does this mean?Martin Xavier, who works at the Fisheries Resource Harvest and Post-harvest Management Division at CIFE, and was one of the scientists involved in the 25 trawls said that the plastic to fish ratio is an estimated 1:17. “For 17kg of fish caught by a trawler off the Mumbai coast, a corresponding 1kg of plastic is also inadvertently caught,” he said. “The presence of plastics is not just an environmental hazard, but also a health hazard. As the plastics remain in the environment, they become a source for microplastics which then find their way into the food chain and can bio-accumulate in humans,” added Xavier.In 2019, he led a study that estimated that there were 80 microplastic particles per 100 grams of fish, bivalves (clams, oysters) and shrimp, caught in Mumbai. Microplastics are small pieces of plastic less than 5mm in length, which enter the environment from disposal and degradation of various consumer and industrial products. Over time, large pieces of plastic break off into tinier fragments under influence of wind, abrasion and exposure to UV light. These may be ingested by marine life, and move up the food chain when humans consume fish, for example.Studies show their potential to disrupt the body’s endocrine, reproductive and cardiovascular systems, in addition to potentially carcinogenic impact. “It is a serious concern as we found microplastic in the tissue, which is the edible part,” Xavier added.It’s not just the deep ocean that’s polluted. A 2013 study led by researchers at the National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency, Sri Lanka, found a mean abundance of 68.83 items of plastic per square metre of land on four beaches in Mumbai: Dadar, Mahim, Juhu and Aksa.A more recent study, published in July this year by researchers at CIFE found that plastics dominate the composition of marine debris in Mumbai’s mangrove forests, comprising 62% of all surface debris items (by number) and 43 percent (by weight) collected from Versova, Gorai, Bandra Bandstand, Sewri, Vikhroli and Elephanta Island. Such empirical findings come as no surprise to environmentalists and citizens, some of whom have stepped in to clean up. One of them is Afroz Shah, a lawyer and environmentalist who was credited with organising the world’s largest beach up in Versova, in 2015, and has since kept up efforts at keeping the beach clean.“In seven years of organising beach clean ups, we’ve collected a total of 85,000 tonnes of plastic from just two beaches, Versova and Danapani. Most of it is plastic, and most of the plastic is food wrappers and multi-layered packaging, or MLP. MLP is so conspicuous precisely because it is essentially impossible to recycle, and the informal system of rag-pickers has no use for it,” Shah said.His team of volunteers now regularly segregates MLPs and sends them to a pyrolysis plant where they are turned into oil.In the past year, in the midst of an unfolding catastrophe like the Covid-19 pandemic, we’ve also added more plastic to our daily use: PPE kits, gloves, face shields, N95 masks. Plastic, plastic everywherePlastic typically enters the ocean through the city’s drainage channels and rivers, along with other pollutants like sewage and industrial waste. One way to reduce its ingress into the sea would then be to clean these channels.Under the Mithi River Rejuvenation pilot, the city purchased a specialised machine for mechanical removal of plastic waste (developed by Finland’s RiverRecycle project; the MMRDA is overseeing the project in association with the global Marine Debris Partnership). The machine is essentially a floating barge with a mechanical barrier that segregates and extracts plastic waste and other debris from the water. It is capable of cleaning up about 50 tonnes of waste a day. But experts argue that this is hardly enough. An assessment by the state mangrove cell across 14 locations in 2019 found that more than 50,000 tonnes of plastic was strewn in mangrove forests alone. Plastic garbage and sewage is found in the other city’s rivers too. According to the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board, the state itself produced over 300,000 tonnes of plastic waste in the year 20-21 alone.“A better option would be to install grates at the sea end of various outflows and have them cleaned regularly. This has been a demand of environmentalists in the past that we have also suggested in the High Court, but the municipality has not shown any inclination toward considering it,” said Stalin D, director of city-based NGO Vanashakti, which is currently pursuing litigation in the Supreme Court to curtail pollution of city drains.For those living in closest proximity to this waste, like Bamaniya, the conspicuousness of plastics has become easy to overlook. “I know it is bad for the environment, and that the fish eat it, but I really don’t know what else to tell you,” he said.What’s fuelling the crisis?On paper, Shah explained, India has a robust set of laws to deal with plastic waste, including the Centre’s Solid Waste Management Rules and Plastic Waste Management Rules. In 2020, the Centre also came up with a draft policy called the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR), which makes manufacturers responsible for recycling an amount of plastic equivalent to what they generate.And while these rules clearly outline pathways for collection, segregation and recycling of plastic, they only address the problem of plastic once it has turned into waste.“In the journey of plastic, it doesn’t start out as waste. There is what I call the pre-litter stage, when plastics exist on shelves of stores and in our homes as items of use. It’s only when they fall out of use that they become waste, and that transition is something that the law has not even begun to address,” Shah said. What is required instead is what experts call a circular economy of plastic, in which these materials aren’t allowed to turn into environmental contaminants. “The EPR rules are meant to address this, but there are problems with it. For example, a manufacturer who produces 10kg of MLPs in a day is not actually required to recycle the same kind of plastic. He can just as easily recycle 10kg of PET bottles, which have more resale value, and fulfill his responsibility. The law generalises the types of plastic, and leaves room for the worst kind to become pollutants. This is why we are stuck in a post-litter narrative, and why beaches need to be constantly cleaned,” Shah said.What’s more, there is no legal mandate for the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board to act on plastic pollution in the ocean. “The mandate of the MPCB is to regulate industries. In the event that an industrial unit is found to be violating the Water Act, we revoke our clearances. But as far as the specific issue of plastic pollution in the ocean is concerned, there is no legal mandate for us to act. Our job is to make sure industries don’t pollute, and the BMC’s job is to keep the beach clean. Where the sand ends and water begins, there is a lack of clarity as to who is accountable for the problem.” HERE’S WHAT WE CAN DOLimit thickness of plastic carry bags, ban manufacture of plastic lesser than 5 microns thick, phase out single use plasticSanction the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) guidelines which places onus of recycling on the manufacturers Recycle more. The state has the capacity to recycle 365,236 tonnes per annum in its 111 recycling units. In 2020-21, Maharashtra generated 311,254 tonnes of plastic; collected 251,556 tonnes of plastic waste; of that, sent 23,237 tonnes to landfills and recycled 221,278 tonnes. Give plastic a longer social life; create a circular economySources: Plastic Waste Management Rules and Solid Waste Management Rules: Central Pollution Control Board)Quote 1: “Whenever we receive segregated waste from generators, all the components including plastic are properly recycled. Pollution happens because of littering and lack of segregation at source, which is as much a responsibility of citizens as that of authorities. The Extended Producer Responsibility guidelines, once implemented, should be able to address the current situation. We have been working closely with the pollution control board for sustainable waste management and will continue to do so.” Minesh Damodar Pimple, deputy chief engineer in the BMC’s solid waste management division Quote 2: “A manufacturer is not required to recycle the same kind of plastic he produces. He can just as easily recycle 10kg of PET bottles that have more resale value.

The TTP have fought for years to overthrow the government in Islamabad and rule the South Asian nation of 220 million with their own brand of Islamic Sharia law.There have been numerous failed attempts to reach peace agreements in the past. The latest talks were opened following the victory of the Afghan Taliban. The two sides have been meeting across the border in Afghanistan, with the aid of Afghan Taliban leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/5-security-personnel-killed-in-separate-attacks-in-pakistan-near-afghanistan-border-101636822547544.html
13-11-2021||World||China, Sri Lanka in rare diplomatic tussle over fertiliser consignment||China and Sri Lanka have been involved in a rare diplomatic tussle over a shipment of organic fertiliser that Colombo refused to accept citing quality issues. In an attempt to turn Sri Lanka into the world's first completely organic farming nation, Colombo struck a deal with Qingdao Seawin Bio-tech group, a Chinese enterprise specialising in seaweed-based fertiliser. But Sri Lanka’s decision to turn down the first consignment of 20,000 tonnes of organic fertiliser has led to diplomatic tension between the two countries.National Plant Quarantine Service, a Sri Lankan government agency, rejected the shipment saying a sample from the cargo had pathogens that can cause crop failure. Dr Ajantha De Silva, director-general, Sri Lankan Department of Agriculture, said that the tests on the cargo samples showed that the fertiliser was not “sterile”, reported BBC."We have identified bacteria which are harmful to plants like carrots and potatoes," BBC quoted De Silva as saying.As the shipment was not allowed to unload in Sri Lanka, a state-run fertiliser company got a court order to stop the state-owned People's Bank from paying $9 million for the cargo. While it’s not clear whether the contract terms allowed the buyer to stop payment, the Chinese embassy in Colombo retaliated by blacklisting the bank for not honouring the payment.In October-end, the official Twitter handle of the Chinese embassy posted a timeline of the events while announcing the blacklisting of the state-run Sri Lankan bank.Timeline:Seawin won open bid, signed contracts, passed tests of China and Int'l agency designated by Ceylon Fertilizer, shipped before due.NPQ SL disagreed in halfway, called toxic/harmful.Ship refused. Third party test refused. L/C payment obligation refused.PBSL blacklisted pic.twitter.com/mMbzqxdwJiThe embassy, however, didn’t provide details on the quality of the fertiliser and the terms of the contract. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said that the cargo had already passed third-party testing, adding that “China has always attached great importance to the quality of exports.”Qingdao Seawin issued a statement accusing Sri Lankan media of using derogatory words to "slander the image of the Chinese enterprises and the Chinese government". It also demanded compensation of $8 million from the NPQ for the loss of reputation it has suffered following the controversy."The unscientific detection method and conclusion of National Plant Quarantine Service (NPQ) in Sri Lanka obviously do not comply with international animal and plant quarantine convention," the company said.While experts are unsure of how long Colombo can resist pressure from Beijing due to its “debt trap” diplomacy, a BBC report citing Sri Lankan officials suggest that “no organic fertiliser that violates current regulations will be allowed into the country" despite China's financial muscle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-sri-lanka-in-rare-diplomatic-tussle-over-fertiliser-consignment-101636815747623.html
13-11-2021||World||Pope Francis thanks journalists for helping uncover Church sexual abuse scandals||Pope Francis on Saturday thanked journalists for helping uncover the clerical sexual abuse scandals that the Roman Catholic Church initially tried to cover up.The pope praised what he called the "mission" of journalism and said it was vital for reporters to get out of their newsrooms and discover what was happening in the outside world to counter misinformation often found online."(I) thank you for what you tell us about what is wrong in the Church, for helping us not to sweep it under the carpet, and for the voice you have given to the abuse victims," the pope said.Francis was speaking at a ceremony to honour two veteran correspondents -- Philip Pullella of Reuters and Valentina Alazraki of Mexico's Noticieros Televisa -- for their long careers spent covering the Vatican.The sexual abuse scandals hit the headlines in 2002, when US daily The Boston Globe wrote a series of articles exposing a pattern of abuse of minors by clerics and a widespread culture of concealment within the Church.Since then, scandals have rocked the Church in myriad countries, most recently France where a major investigation found in October that French clerics had sexually abused more than 200,000 children over the past 70 years.Critics accused Francis of responding too slowly to the scandals after he became Pontiff in 2013 and of believing the word of his fellow clergy over that of the abuse victims.But in 2018 he tried to address past mistakes, publicly admitting he was wrong about a case in Chile and vowing that the Church would never again seek to cover up such wrongdoing. In 2019 he called for an "all-out battle" against a crime that should be "erased from the face of the earth".Francis on Saturday said journalists had a mission "to explain the world, to make it less obscure, to make those who live in it less fear it".To do that, he said reporters needed to "escape the tyranny" of always being online. "Not everything can be told through email, the phone, or a screen," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-francis-thanks-journalists-for-helping-uncover-church-sexual-abuse-scandals-101636814456174.html
13-11-2021||World||‘Future of entire generation at stake’: UN official on increasing child marriage among girls in Afghanistan||A top UN official expressed concerns about increasing child marriages in Afghanistan and said there have been reports about families offering daughters only 20-days old for future marriages in return for a dowry.The executive director of the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Henrietta Fore in a statement said that estimates showed 28% of Afghan women between 15 and 49 years of age were married before turning 18.“I am deeply concerned by reports that child marriage in Afghanistan is on the rise. We have received credible reports of families offering daughters as young as 20 days old up for future marriage in return for a dowry,” Fore said in a statement.“Even before the latest political instability, UNICEF’s partners registered 183 child marriages and 10 cases of selling of children over 2018 and 2019 in Herat and Baghdis provinces alone. The children were between 6 months and 17 years of age,” she added. “UNICEF estimates that 28 per cent of Afghan women aged 15–49 years were married before the age of 18,” she further said.Also read | Nearly 55% of Afghans expected to face food insecurity soon, UN report saysThe UNICEF head also noted that the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, food crisis in the country and the onset of winter have worsened the situation for many families, highlighting that almost 50% of Afghan families lacked basic nutrition or clean water in 2020. “The extremely dire economic situation in Afghanistan is pushing more families deeper into poverty and forcing them to make desperate choices, such as putting children to work and marrying girls off at a young age,” she said.Further, she said that most teenage girls in the country were not allowed to go back to school and thus increasing the risk of child marriage. “Education is often the best protection against negative coping mechanisms such as child marriage and child labour,” she added.Notably, Taliban foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi on Friday claimed that 75% of the girls in the country had resumed their education.UNICEF also called on the “de facto authorities” in Afghanistan to prioritise reopening of schools for secondary school girls and allowing female teachers to resume their work. The UN body also said that it is working to raise awareness about child marriage for girls. “Child marriage can lead to a lifetime of suffering. Girls who marry before they turn 18 are less likely to remain in school and more likely to experience domestic violence, discrimination, abuse and poor mental health. They are also more vulnerable to complications in pregnancy and childbirth,” Fore said.“We have started a cash assistance programme to help offset the risk of hunger, child labour and child marriage among the most vulnerable families. We plan to scale up this and other social services programmes in the months to come,” she added. She also said that UNICEF would work with religious leaders to ensure that they were not involved in the marriage of young girls. However, she said that the measures were not enough. “The future of an entire generation is at stake,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/future-of-entire-generation-at-stake-un-official-on-increasing-child-marriage-among-girls-in-afghanistan-101636813142634.html
13-11-2021||World||3rd draft Glasgow cover decision continues to be weak on finance, loss and adaptation||After night long negotiations on several elements of the Glasgow cover decision, the COP 26 Presidency released another draft text on Saturday morning. Though the third draft text reaffirms the Paris Agreement goal, it has struck a compromise on several fronts and is rather weak on climate finance, adaptation and loss and damage.Climate negotiation experts are disappointed that after a big build up to COP 26 and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) spelling out the urgency of climate crisis, the negotiations failed to capture certain important elements which are critical for implementation of climate change mitigation in developing countries. Following an informal plenary by COP 26 President, Alok Sharma later today, the draft is likely to be considered for adoption. Developing and vulnerable countries are expected to express their views at the plenary. For the first time, the draft cover decision has mentioned the need for phase out of coal and fossil fuel subsidies. But, after several developing countries dissented, the language has been cushioned to say we need to transition towards low emission energy systems, including by rapidly scaling up the deployment of clean power generation and energy efficiency measures “including accelerating efforts towards the phase-out of unabated coal power and inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, recognizing the need for support towards a just transition.”Developing countries like India and the Like-Minded Developing Countries (LMDC—a group of 22 countries) had also sought the mention of historical responsibility in the global average temperature rise of 1.1 degree C till now. The text does not mention that but states: “also noting the importance for some of the concept of ‘climate justice’, when taking action to address climate change.”Climate Finance:One of the main asks for India has been a multilaterally agreed definition of climate finance, delivery of the promised USD 100 billion by developed countries (in 2009) and for a structured process that will deliver the new quantified climate finance goal for climate finance well before 2025. The agreement expresses “deep regret” that the goal of developed country parties to mobilize jointly USD 100 billion per year by 2020 in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation has not yet been met.” The draft agreement urges developed countries to fully deliver on the USD 100 billion goal urgently and through to 2025 and emphasizes the importance of transparency in the implementation of their pledges. It only re-emphasizes the need for scaled-up financial resources to consider the needs of countries particularly vulnerable to climate change and welcomes the initiation of deliberations on a new collective quantified goal on climate finance.“There is nothing much. There is no real commitment on part of developed countries to move ahead with serious and urgent domestic action let alone in terms of global collaboration and truly significant climate finance for tackling climate change,” said Manjeev Singh Puri, former negotiator and ambassador responding to the draft.Loss and Damage:The new draft instead of specifying how finance and compensation will be delivered for Loss and Damage (compensation for impacts of extreme climate change events and slow onset events like sea level rise) talks of setting up “dialogue between parties, relevant organizations, and stakeholders” to discuss the arrangements for the funding of activities to avert, minimise and address loss and damage. Delegates, activists from developing and vulnerable countries were fuming after reading the text. The G77+China had proposed for a Glasgow Facility on loss and damage. The draft only urges developed countries, the operating entities of the Financial Mechanism, United Nations entities and intergovernmental organizations and other bilateral and multilateral institutions, including non-governmental organizations and private sources, to provide enhanced and additional support for activities addressing loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change.“Draft political #COP26 decisions circulated grossly fail any credibility tests:phase out of fossil fuels references are now so weakened down that it is mind-blowing on #LossAndDamage: outcome proposed here is basically more blablabla these drafts CANNOT be accepted,” tweeted Sébastien Duyck, senior attorney working towards climate justice.India had also sought serious decisions at COP26 on compensating loss and damage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/3rd-draft-glasgow-cover-decision-continues-to-be-weak-on-finance-loss-and-adaptation-101636801309058.html
13-11-2021||World||China warns US on Taiwan ahead of Xi-Biden meet||China on Saturday warned the US not to send wrong signals to or support “Taiwan independence” hours after Beijing announced that President Xi Jinping will meet his US counterpart Joe Biden via video link on Tuesday morning.“Chinese President Xi Jinping will meet with US President Joe Biden via video link on the morning of November 16 (Beijing Time),” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said on Saturday.Soon after the announcement of the Xi-Biden meeting, senior Chinese diplomat Wang Yi told US secretary of state, Anthony Blinken that “…any connivance of and support for the ‘Taiwan independence’ forces undermines peace across the Taiwan Strait and would only boomerang in the end”.Wang made the remarks in a phone conversation with Blinken ahead of the two top leaders’ Tuesday summit.According to a readout of the phone conversation released by the Chinese foreign minister, Wang, who is both state councillor and foreign minister, said if the US truly wants to safeguard peace across the Taiwan Strait, then it should clearly and resolutely oppose any “Taiwan independence” moves.The US should abide by the solemn commitments it made in the “..three China-US joint communiques and put the one-China policy into action and stop sending wrong signals to the Taiwan independence forces,” Wang said.Ties between US and Taiwan is one of the major bilateral problems between Beijing and Washington with the former consistently criticising the latter’s ties with Taipei, which the mainland sees as a breakaway region to be unified by force if required.The statement from the Chinese foreign ministry said Wang and Blinken also exchanged views on issues including energy security, climate change and the Iranian nuclear issue, and agreed to maintain dialogue on responding to all kinds of global challenges.On the upcoming meeting, Wang said it will be keenly followed by the whole world as it is of great significance not just for China-US relations, but also for international relations.“The helmsmanship of the two heads of state plays a key role in steering bilateral relations,” he said.Blinken was quoted as saying that both sides have made full preparation and are making progress. “The US side looks forward to sharing views on bilateral ties with the Chinese side during the meeting in the spirit of mutual respect and jointly send a strong message to the world,” Blinken told Wang Yi.Besides fraught ties over a range of issues from trade ties to human rights and transparency over the origins of Covid-19 pandemic, Tuesday’s Xi-Biden meeting will take place in the backdrop of rapid developments in Afghanistan.In September, Xi had told Biden during a phone conversation that the US’ China policy has resulted in serious difficulties in bilateral ties and runs counter to the fundamental interests of the two countries and the common interests of the world.The conversation ended a seven-month gap in direct communication between the leaders of the world’s two largest economies but gave an indication of the existing problems in ties.The only time the two had spoken before September was on February 12, which, incidentally, was also the first time they had spoken after Biden became the US President in January this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-warns-us-on-taiwan-ahead-of-xi-biden-meet-101636796268608.html

From September 18, the Taliban allowed boys from classes 6-12 to and male teachers to attend schools.Some schools reopened for girls up to class 6 and women were also allowed to visit universities. But high schools are shut for girls and the Islamic emirate claimed in September that they will be allowed to resume classes for all girls at the earliest.The Taliban has received sharp criticism from the global community for restricting education for girls.Also Read| Afghan girls will be allowed to return to school 'as soon as possible': TalibanOn Friday, foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi also said that it was the global community's duplicity to emphasise women’s education rather than focus on the salary of teachers as salary disbursement becoming difficult due to Afghanistan's assets frozen by the West, the Dawn report said.Muttaqi added as many as 500,000 civil servants in Afghanistan were being paid and no one was fired because of differences in political views. No woman has been sacked, the acting foreign minister also claimed, according to the report.However, several media reports have suggested that women are still not being allowed to go to work and several of them have protested to demand the rights to employment and education.On the other hand, a majority of girl students in Afghanistan who depend on the public education system, also remain at home."Amendments will be made based on our new laws. Islamic scholars will make the decisions," Abdul Hakeim, the chief of staff for the minister of education, said in November."We want an Islamic perspective, and this means separate classes and transport. Once this is sorted out, girls can continue education for a lifetime," Hakeim added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-claim-75-of-girl-students-back-in-afghanistan-schools-101636784083717.html
13-11-2021||World||Canada: Alleged member of proscribed ISYF may be deported to India||A Canadian court has dismissed an application by a person alleged to be the former president of the proscribed International Sikh Youth Federation (ISYF), potentially paving the way for his deportation to India.The ruling was delivered against an application by Ranjit Singh Khalsa by justice Glennys McVeigh of the federal court in Ottawa in late October. Khalsa, who resides in the Metro Vancouver region, had, through his lawyers, contested a decision by a member of the immigration division (ID) of the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB), which found him to be “inadmissible to Canada” under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act “for having been a member” of the ISYF, which became a listed terrorist entity in Canada on June 18, 2003.Stewart Bell, senior journalist with the Canadian outlet Global News, tweeted in this regard, “Federal court upholds deportation order against ISYF member.”In fact, Khalsa is also alleged to have been the president of the ISYF.Khalsa remains an Indian citizen. He came to Canada in 1988 and filed a refugee claim and became a permanent resident in 1992. However, his subsequent application for citizenship finally led to the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) finding him inadmissible because of the alleged ties to the ISYF.The immigration division of the IRB found him inadmissible in a decision dated February 25, 2021, and also issued a deportation order.In her ruling, delivered on October 28, justice McVeigh noted, “In sum, I find the decision - which is long, detailed, and grapples with the major issues - to be reasonable. The ID member dealt reasonably with the evidence before them, and demonstrated a logical chain of analysis that was justified in light of the facts and law before them.”A report from the national broadcaster CBC from August 30, 1999, described Khalsa as “the president of the International Sikh Youth Federation” while quoting him in an article.Hindustan Times reached out to the Vancouver-based law firm Edelmann & Company, which represented Khalsa, for comment on the ruling and whether they were planning to pursue the matter further, but has not received a response so far.Public Safety Canada has ISYF in its listing of terrorist entities. Its description reads: “Since 1984, its members have been engaged in terrorist attacks, assassinations and bombings primarily against Indian political figures, but also against moderate members of the Sikh community.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-proscribed-isyf-member-may-be-deported-to-india-101636787088134.html
13-11-2021||World||US: Former Donald Trump adviser faces jail over Jan 6 insurrection||Steve Bannon, a one-time senior adviser to former President Donald Trump, was on Friday charged with contempt of US congress for defying a subpoena issued to him by a select committee of the House of Representatives that is investigating the January 6 insurrection.Bannon will turn himself in to authorities on Monday. If convicted on the two counts on which he was indicted by a grand jury - one for refusal to appear before the committee and the other for refusing to turn over documents - he faces up to two years in prison and $2,000 in fine.The House committee had summoned him on September 23 but Bannon refused claiming protection of Trump’s presidential executive privilege, which immunises the American president (and former presidents) and his aides from legal challenges for actions taken while in office.The indictment was brought by the US attorney for Washington DC (District of Columbia) after it was cleared by attorney general Merrick Garland in a much anticipated move that presages similar outcomes for many other members of the Trump orbit who have either already claimed executive privilege to defy the committee’s subpoena - such as former chief of staff Mark Meadows - or plan to.“Since my first day in office, I have promised justice department employees that together we would show the American people by word and deed that the department adheres to the rule of law, follows the facts and the law and pursues equal justice under the law,” Garland said, adding, “Today’s charges reflect the department’s steadfast commitment to these principles.”The committee had summoned Steve Bannon saying it had reason to believe he had information pertaining to the January 6 insurrection. “You have been identified as present at the Willard Hotel (which is just a block from the White House and has been a popular hotel for Indian prime ministers and officials on official visit to DC) on January 5, 2021, during an effort to persuade members of congress to block the certification of the election the next day, and in relation to other activities on January 6.... Moreover, you are quoted as stating, on January 5,2021, that ‘(a)ll hell is going to break loose tomorrow’,” the subpoena said.A mob of hundreds of Donald Trump supporters had stormed a joint session of US congress on January 6 to prevent the certification of Joe Biden as president. The insurrection - as the incident has been called officially - was incited by Trump’s false claims of election fraud behind his defeat in the November polls.The committee has issued subpoenas to at least 20 aides of the former president, who include Meadows and former senior adviser Stephen Miller and former White House spokesperson Kayleigh McEnany, who were working with President Trump at the time in the White House.Unlike them, however, Steve Bannon was not working in the White House then. Trump had fired him way back in 2017, but kept him on his speed dial as an adviser. Bannon played a big role in amplifying Trump’s lies about election fraud, as did the former president’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jan-6-insurrection-in-us-former-donald-trump-adviser-faces-jail-101636782287949.html

He has been sentenced to 11 years in jail by a military court in Yangon city for violating visa regulations, association with an illegal group and dissent against the military.Having been in detention since May this year, the American journalist is also facing two additional charges in a different court for violating Myanmar's counterterrorism law and a statute covering treason and sedition.Michelle Bachelet, the United Nations commissioner for human rights, said the sentencing of Fenster was emblematic of a wider plight of journalists in Myanmar who have faced constant repression in the wake of the February coup.Also Read| Myanmar court sentences US journalist to 11 years in jailAccording to the news agency Associated Press, Fenster is the only foreign journalist to be convicted of a serious crime in Myanmar after the fall of Aung San Suu Kyi's government."Journalists have been under attack since 1 February, with the military leadership clearly attempting to suppress their attempts to report on the serious human rights violations being perpetrated across Myanmar as well as the extent of opposition to the regime", Bachelet said, according to an official statement.She said that at least 126 journalists, media officials or publishers had been detained since the coup and 47 of them continue to be in detention.Also Read| Those detained being systematically tortured in Myanmar: ReportThe UN rights chief also pointed out that licenses of as many as nine media outlets had been revoked, while 20 other media houses suspended their operations, the official statement added.Meanwhile, the United States called Danny Fenster's sentencing a conviction of an innocent person and said that it is working towards his immediate release."We are closely monitoring Danny's situation and will continue to work for his immediate release.

13-11-2021||World||Australia, South Korea beyond India & China in per capita coal emissions||India is the world's second-largest consumer of coal-based power, however, its per capita emission is far less than the global average, a fraction of what some of the world's richest countries – such as the United States and Australia – emit, revealed a new analysis by Ember, an independent climate and energy think tank focused on accelerating the global electricity transition. According to research conducted by the organisation, the average person in India emits only half of what the average Canadian would do through coal power and eight times less than the average Australian.The data shows that countries such as Australia, South Korea, South Africa, and the United States are among the worst coal power emitters when the emission figures are adjusted for population size. While Australia has the highest per capita coal emissions in the world (the average Australian emits five times as much carbon dioxide from coal power than the average person globally), South Korea and the United States emit almost four times and three times the global average, respectively.Some pertinent highlights from the Ember analysis:1 . Australia has the highest per capita coal emissions in the entire world; the country emits 5.34 tonnes of carbon dioxide every year. The average Australian emits five times as much carbon dioxide from coal as the average person globally, and almost twice as much as the average person in China.2 . South Korea has the second-highest per-capita coal emissions, among all the G20 countries, at 3.81 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year. The average Korean emits almost four times as much carbon dioxide from coal as the global average.3. The United States has the fourth-highest per capita coal emissions in the G20 at 3.08 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year. The average American emits almost thrice as much carbon dioxide from coal as the global average.4. China was found to be the world's largest coal power consumer and also the fifth in the per capital coal emissions ranking. The country emits 2.71 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year; an average citizen emits 2.5 times as much carbon dioxide from coal as the global average.Notably, according to the International Energy Agency's Net Zero Roadmap, countries within the OECD such as Australia, South Korea, the United States, Germany, and Japan have pledged to end coal power by 2030 to align with a 1.5-degree pathway. However, the recent report sends alarming signals about the global coal emission situation, as these are the very countries found to be among the worst performers on coal power when the data is adjusted for population size.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-south-korea-beyond-india-china-in-per-capita-coal-emissions-101636776615172.html
13-11-2021||World||Former Trump aide Steve Bannon indicted for contempt of Congress||Steve Bannon, a longtime ally of former US president Donald Trump, was indicted Friday on two counts of criminal contempt of Congress after he defied a subpoena from the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection at the US Capitol.The justice department said Bannon, 67, was indicted on one count for refusing to appear for a deposition last month and the other for refusing to provide documents in response to the committee’s subpoena. He is expected to surrender to authorities on Monday and will appear in court that afternoon, a law enforcement official told the AP. The person was granted anonymity to discuss the case.The indictment comes after a parade of Trump administration officials — including Bannon — have defied requests and demands from Congress over the past five years with little consequence, including during Democrats' impeachment inquiry. President Barack Obama's administration also declined to charge two of its officials who defied congressional demands.Attorney General Merrick Garland said Bannon’s indictment reflects the Justice Department’s “steadfast commitment” to the rule of law. Each count carries a minimum of 30 days of jail and as long as a year behind bars.The indictment came as a second expected witness, former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, defied his own subpoena from the committee on Friday and as Trump has escalated his legal battles to withhold documents and testimony about the insurrection.If the House votes to hold Meadows in contempt, that recommendation would also be sent to the Justice Department for a possible indictment.Officials in both Democratic and Republican administrations have been held in contempt by Congress, but criminal indictments for contempt are exceedingly rare. The most recent notable examples of criminal penalties for not testifying before Congress date to the 1970s, including when President Richard Nixon’s aide G. Gordon Liddy was convicted of misdemeanor charges for refusing to answer questions about his role in the Watergate scandal.Democrats who voted to hold Bannon in contempt praised the Justice Department's decision, saying the charges reinforce the authority of Congress to investigate the executive branch and signal potential consequences for those who refuse to cooperate.“The days of defying subpoenas with impunity are over,” tweeted House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, who sits on the Jan. 6 panel and also led Trump's first impeachment inquiry. “We will expose those responsible for Jan 6. No one is above the law.”The chairman of the Jan. 6 panel, Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson, told reporters at an event in his home state of Mississippi on Friday that he will recommend contempt charges against Meadows next week.Thompson and the vice chairwoman of the panel, Republican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, said in a statement: “Mr. Meadows, Mr. Bannon, and others who go down this path won’t prevail in stopping the Select Committee’s effort getting answers for the American people about January 6th, making legislative recommendations to help protect our democracy, and helping ensure nothing like that day ever happens again."Meadows and Bannon are key witnesses for the panel, as they both were in close touch with Trump around the time of the insurrection.Meadows was Trump’s top aide at the end of his presidency and was one of several people who pressured state officials to try and overturn the results. Bannon promoted the Jan. 6 protests on his podcast and predicted there would be unrest. On Jan. 5, he predicted that “all hell is going to break loose.”The indictment says Bannon didn’t communicate with the committee in any way from the time he received the subpoena on Sept. 24 until Oct. 7 when his lawyer sent a letter, seven hours after the documents were due.Bannon, who worked at the White House at the beginning of the Trump administration and currently serves as host of the conspiracy-minded “War Room” podcast, is a private citizen who “refused to appear to give testimony as required by a subpoena,” the indictment says.When Bannon declined to appear for his deposition in October, his attorney said the former Trump adviser had been directed by a lawyer for Trump citing executive privilege not to answer questions. The attorney did not respond to a message seeking comment on Friday.This is not the first time the longtime Trump ally has faced legal peril. In August of last year, Bannon was pulled from a luxury yacht and arrested on allegations that he and three associates ripped off donors trying to fund a southern border wall. Trump later pardoned Bannon in the final hours of his presidency.Meadows, a former congressman from North Carolina, defied his subpoena on Friday after weeks of discussions with the committee. His lawyer said that Meadows has a “sharp legal dispute” with the panel as Trump has claimed executive privilege over the former chief of staff's testimony, as he had with Bannon's.The White House said in a letter Thursday that President Joe Biden would waive any privilege that would prevent Meadows from cooperating with the committee, prompting Meadows' lawyer to say he wouldn't comply.“Legal disputes are appropriately resolved by courts,” said the lawyer, George Terwilliger. “It would be irresponsible for Mr. Meadows to prematurely resolve that dispute by voluntarily waiving privileges that are at the heart of those legal issues.”As the sitting president, Biden has so far waived most of Trump's assertions of privilege over documents and interviews, citing the interest of the public in knowing what happened on Jan. 6. Trump sued the committee and the National Archives to stop the release of documents, and U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan has repeatedly backed Biden's position, noting in one ruling this week that “Presidents are not kings, and Plaintiff is not President.”The panel's proceedings and attempts to gather information have been delayed as Trump has appealed Chutkan's rulings. On Thursday, a federal appeals court temporarily blocked the release of some of the White House records the panel is seeking, giving that court time to consider Trump's arguments.Still, the House panel is continuing its work, and members have already interviewed more than 150 witnesses in an attempt to build a comprehensive record of how a violent mob of Trump's supporters broke into the Capitol and temporarily halted the certification of Biden's victory.The committee has subpoenaed almost three dozen people, including former White House staffers, Trump allies who strategized about how to overturn his defeat and people who organized a giant rally near the White House on the morning of Jan. 6. While some, like Meadows and Bannon, have balked, others have spoken to the panel and provided documents.___Emily Wagster Pettus reported from Mississippi.

13-11-2021||World||US court extends order pausing Biden's shot-or-test mandate for businesses||A US appeals court has extended its November 6 order pausing President Joe Biden’s shot-or-test mandate for businesses with 100 or more employees.The ruling, issued today by the New Orleans-based US court of appeals for the fifth circuit, solidifies its earlier order blocking implementation of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s emergency regulation. Its ruling comes ahead of a Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation lottery to determine which federal appeals court will be assigned to adjudicate the many legal challenges to the measure now pending across the country. The lottery is slated for November 16.In a 22-page opinion, the court had harsh words for the vaccine mandate. The mandate “threatens to substantially burden the liberty interests of reluctant individual recipients put to a choice between their job(s) and their jab(s),” the court said.“Likewise, the companies seeking a stay, in this case, will also be irreparably harmed in the absence of a stay, whether by the business and financial effects or a lost or suspended employee, compliance and monitoring costs associated with the Mandate, the diversion of resources necessitated by the Mandate, or by OSHA’s plan to impose stiff financial penalties on companies that refuse to punish or test unwilling employees,” the court said.The US had asked the court to set aside its prior order to allow that process to play out.OSHA’s rule requires qualifying businesses to ensure that all employees are fully vaccinated by January 4 or subjected to testing for Covid-19 at least weekly.Barring a long-lasting injunction, employers will have to comply with other parts of the rule by December 5, including developing a compliance plan, offering paid time off for vaccinations, and requiring unvaccinated workers to wear masks.The Fifth Circuit is considering challenges filed by Texas, joined by Louisiana, Mississippi, Utah, South Carolina, and companies that claim they’re adversely affected by the rule. The plaintiffs contend the emergency temporary standard, formally published Nov. 5, exceeds OSHA’s statutory authority and that the requisite “grave danger” the safety agency cited as justification for the expedited rulemaking doesn’t actually exist outside of the healthcare industry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-court-extends-order-pausing-biden-s-shot-or-test-mandate-for-businesses-101636770807878.html

Here's what experts say||Cases of “mysterious viral fever” are being witnessed in Pakistan's Karachi that behave exactly like dengue fever as it reduces platelets and white blood cells of the patients, local media reported citing field experts.The News International citing clinicians and pathologists on Thursday reported that when the viral fever was tested for dengue, the result comes out to be negative."For a couple of weeks, we are seeing cases of viral fever, in which platelets and white blood cells are dropping while other clinical symptoms are also similar to the dengue fever. But when NS1 antigen of these patients is performed, their tests come out to be negative," Professor Saeed Khan, the head of molecular pathology at the Dow University of Health Sciences, said, according to the publication.Other experts, including physicians and hemato-pathologists from different hospitals of the city, have also confirmed that a dengue virus-like pathogen is circulating in Karachi, causing a disease that is acting similar to dengue fever and requires the same treatment protocols but it is not dengue fever.A molecular scientist, Dr Muhammad Zohaib, who is associated with the Children's Hospital in Gulshan-e-Iqbal, also confirmed that cases of viral fever, which was not dengue but had dengue-like symptoms, had been witnessed by them as well as several other pathologists in the city."Owing to this mysterious viral disease in addition to growing number of dengue fever cases, there is an extreme shortage of mega units of platelets as well as random units in the city. People are moving from pillar to post for mega units and random platelets units for their loved ones," he said.As many as 45 new dengue fever cases have been reported in Pakistan's capital city Islamabad on Friday, ARY News reported citing the district health officer (DHO) said.According to Pakistani media, a total of 4,292 mosquito-borne viral disease cases have been reported in the federal capital in the current season.According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection that is common in warm, tropical climates and often peaks during rainy seasons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mysterious-viral-fever-reported-in-pakistan-s-karachi-here-s-what-experts-say-101636769723127.html

These animals had mild symptoms, although some had a cough and nasal discharge.Apart from them, none of the other 12,000 animals in the St. Louis Zoo have tested positive, the local newspaper reported. The staff has not traced the source of the infection among the cats.The zoo has been vaccinating its animals with an animal-specific vaccine for more than a month against the disease that has wreaked havoc on the global human population, The Hill reported.In September, six big cats tested positive for the coronavirus at the Smithsonian National Zoo.According to the CDC, the risk of animals spreading the coronavirus to humans is low, but people have been documented spreading the virus to animals across the world, according to The Hill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eight-big-cats-test-covid-19-positive-in-us-zoo-report-101636766079842.html
13-11-2021||World||Chinese embassy pushes US businesses to oppose anti-China bills: Report||China has been pushing US executives, companies and business groups in recent weeks to fight against China-related bills in the US Congress, four sources familiar with the initiative told Reuters, in letters to and meetings with a wide range of actors in the business community.Letters from China's embassy in Washington have pressed executives to urge members of Congress to alter or drop specific bills that seek to enhance US competitiveness, according to the sources and the text of a letter sent by the embassy's economic and commercial office seen by Reuters.Chinese officials warned companies they would risk losing market share or revenue in China if the legislation becomes law, according to the text of the letter.The Chinese embassy and the head of its economic and commercial office did not return separate requests for comment.The sources said China's request also left some individuals who received a letter concerned that they could be seen as violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) if they lobbied lawmakers on similar issues in the future.As a result, none of the sources wanted to be identified as having received or seen the letter.Sweeping legislation to boost US competition with China and fund much-needed semiconductor production, known as the US Innovation and Competition Act (USICA), passed the Senate with bipartisan support in June. A related bill in the House of Representatives called the Eagle Act, which is more strictly policy focused, has stalled as Congress has been preoccupied with other domestic initiatives.The language in the letters, which Reuters determined were sent separately to a wide number of people, explicitly asks companies to oppose USICA and the Eagle Act.Beijing sees the measures, which take a hard line toward China on human rights and trade issues, as part of a US effort to counter the country's growing economic and geopolitical might."We sincerely hope you... will play a positive role in urging members of Congress to abandon the zero-sum mindset and ideological prejudice, stop touting negative China-related bills, delete negative provisions, so as to create favorable conditions for bilateral economic and trade cooperation before it is too late," the Chinese embassy said in one letter sent in early November.Reuters confirmed the shared language of the letter with the four sources."The result of those China-related bills with negative impacts will not be that the interests of US companies will be protected while those of Chinese companies will suffer. It is only going to hurt everyone," it said."Promoting a China-free supply chain will inevitably result in a decline in China's demand for US products and American companies loss of market share and revenue in China," it said.Two of the sources said similar messages were conveyed in meetings with staff of China's embassy."It's an outright ask by a foreign government," one of the sources said, highlighting the implications for FARA, which requires persons acting on behalf of a foreign power or political party to disclose those relations to the Department of Justice.A second source said the approach appeared geared at getting companies to delay the legislative process rather than block the bills entirely.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-embassy-pushes-us-businesses-to-oppose-anti-china-bills-report-101636756442726.html

Fischer, 54, of Hopatcong, were aboard the single-engine Cessna 172 that went down Thursday.De Vries was an instrument-rated private pilot, and Fischer owned a flight school. Authorities have not said who was piloting the small plane.The plane had left Essex County Airport in Caldwell, on the edge of the New York City area, and was headed to Sussex Airport, in rural northwestern New Jersey, when the Federal Aviation Administration alerted public safety agencies to look for the missing plane around 3 p.m.Emergency crews found the wreckage in Hampton Township around 4 p.m., the FAA said.De Vries, co-founder of a tech company, took a 10-minute flight to the edge of space Oct. 13 aboard Blue Origin’s New Shepard spacecraft with Shatner and two others.“It’s going to take me a while to be able to describe it. It was incredible,” de Vries said as he got his Blue Origin “astronaut wings” pinned onto his blue flight suit by Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos."We are devastated to hear of the sudden passing of Glen de Vries," Blue Origin tweeted Friday. “He brought so much life and energy to the entire Blue Origin team and to his fellow crewmates. His passion for aviation, his charitable work, and his dedication to his craft will long be revered and admired.”De Vries co-founded Medidata Solutions, a software company specializing in clinical research, and was the vice chair of life sciences and health care at Dassault Systemes, which acquired Medidata in 2019. He had taken part in an auction for a seat on the first flight and bought a seat on the second trip.De Vries also served on the board of Carnegie Mellon University.Fischer owned the flight school Fischer Aviation and was its chief instructor, according to the company's website.The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vries-who-went-to-space-with-shatner-aboard-blue-origin-dies-in-plane-crash-101636756162328.html

13-11-2021||World||As time runs out, COP26 tries to reach compromise between equity and ambition||A new cover decision draft text was released by the Glasgow climate change conference (COP 26) Presidency on Friday morning after there was no consensus on the previous one released on Wednesday. The new draft text changed the language on some fronts to strike a compromise with dissenting parties. One of those is weakening the language on the phaseout of coal and fossil fuel subsidies. Both coal and fossil fuel phaseout are being explicitly mentioned for the first time in decision texts.Text on coal and fossil fuels weakenedThe previous draft on Wednesday called upon parties to “accelerate the phasing-out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels” which has now been reworded to “adoption of policies for the transition towards low-emission energy systems, including by rapidly scaling up clean power generation and accelerating the phaseout of unabated coal power and of inefficient subsidies for fossil fuels.” Saudi Arabia and a few other developing countries had objected to the clause on fossil fuels while some countries like China and India had also raised concerns with phasing out of coal.The new draft reaffirms the Paris Agreement temperature goal of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels. Instead of “urging” parties to revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets in their nationally determined contributions (NDCs), as necessary to align with the Paris Agreement temperature goal by the end of 2022, the new draft “requests” parties to revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets. Some experts said, “requests” can be considered stronger language than “urges” in United Nations parlance. The Like Minded Developing Countries (LMDC), including India and China, had objected to this timeline for revisiting the targets.There are no major changes to the rest of the text. In summary: the draft continues to recognise the 1.5 degrees global warming goal; it also recognizes that limiting global warming to 1.5 °C requires rapid, deep and sustained reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions, including reducing global carbon dioxide emissions by 45% by 2030 relative to the 2010 level and to net-zero around mid-century, as well as deep reductions in non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gases.No improvement on climate financeThe language on finance is slightly stronger but still weak overall without clear timelines. It “notes with deep regret that the goal of developed country parties to mobilize jointly USD 100 billion per year by 2020 in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation has not yet been met.”The draft urges developed country parties to fully deliver on the USD 100 billion goal urgently and through to 2025 and emphasizes the importance of transparency in the implementation of their pledges; urges the operating entities of the Financial Mechanism, multilateral development banks and other financial institutions to further scale up investments in climate action and calls for a continued increase in the scale and effectiveness of climate finance from all sources globally, including grants and other highly concessional forms of finance.Progress in adaptation and loss and damageBut there are two redeeming features—on adaptation, the draft urges developed countries to at least double their collective provision of climate finance for adaptation to developing countries from the current level by 2025 as a step towards achieving a balance between mitigation and adaptation. But it still doesn’t say 50-50% break-up of finance for adaptation and mitigation which developing countries had been asking for. Loss and damage (mechanism to compensate vulnerable countries for loss due to extreme climate events and slow onset events) has its own section. It recognises the importance of compensating loss and damage the Santiago network on Loss and Damage will be supported by a technical assistance facility to provide financial support for technical assistance for the implementation of relevant approaches to avert, minimize, and address loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change. It also “urges” developed country parties to provide funds for the technical facility and for the operation of the Santiago network but experts said the text still falls short of starting a finance stream on loss and damage.Carbon market in the makingDraft texts on various aspects of carbon markets or Article 6 were also out on Friday morning. Though most of it remained bracketed, there was some progress, experts said. For India, the issue of carbon markets has been of priority. The environmental integrity of the market mechanism is of the highest concern, experts said. “The issue of the corresponding adjustment (applying adjustments will help avoid double counting of emissions reductions) is at the heart of the Article 6 discussions along with carryover and methodologies. The newly presented distinct options of Paris Agreement Adjusted Units and Paris Agreement Support Units can potentially help address the double claiming issue that is widely debated,” said Chirag Gajjar, Head Subnational Climate Action, World Resources Institute, India. Double counting refers to a situation where two parties (buyer and seller) claim emission reduction.“The text fails to deliver on strong climate action. Only 'inefficient' fossil fuel subsidies need to go out, other subsidies can continue. Coal power need not be phased out, only 'unabated' coal power needs to be phased out. Basically, the updated text is about 'we want everyone to be happy' rather than 'we want everyone to be ambitious.’ On finance, the only thing developing countries have got is a more aggressive 'tone' in the text, rather than anything meaningful. So, it is 'deeply regretted' that the USD 100 billion target is not achieved, and developed parties are 'urged' to meet this by 2025. There has been no upping of financial commitments, something that India's PM Modi emphasized on the first day,” said Vaibhav Chaturvedi, fellow, Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW). “The financial facility for loss and damage is very useful. But if progress on it is at the same pace as that of the larger finance debate, the delivery will leave much to be desired,” Chaturvedi added."The latest draft has diluted language on coal and fossil fuels, to only address unabated coal power and inefficient subsidies for fossil fuels. It does mention a new "technical assistance facility" for loss and damage in addition to the Santiago Network. However, overall language on climate finance and loss and damage are still extremely vague and weak, with no mention of specific additional finance,” said Avantika Goswami, climate-policy specialist at Centre for Science and Environment.“Rich countries like the USA, European Union and Australia push back on starting a new stream of finance under the UN Climate Change that is urgently needed to help vulnerable communities facing losses and damages. The biggest historical emitters continue to look the other way as millions suffer from crop failures, devastating floods, ravaging wildfires and are being displaced and forced to migrate to survive,” said Harjeet Singh, senior advisor, Climate Action Network International adding that “they do recognise the need to increase finance to address loss and damage but fall short of starting a new stream.”People against ‘carbon colonialism’A fully packed People’s Plenary took place at COP 26 on Friday a few hours after the draft text was released. Various constituencies representing indigenous people, gender rights etc compared climate change to colonialism. Ta’kaiya Blaney, indigenous youth activist and a member of Tla’amin First Nation from Salish Sea in British Columbia said, “My lands, waters are under the genocidal legal occupation of the Canadian government… climate change bleeds us of our birthright. Climate change is a symbol of colonialism. Nature-based solutions and carbon markets are false solutions and only lead to the commodification of nature. Tasneem Essop, executive director of Climate Action Network International compared climate crisis to apartheid. “Let’s say no to vaccine apartheid; no to climate apartheid those leaders inside are busy signing off and deleting human rights, gender rights from the text…they are not willing to provide financial support which is their obligation. Climate justice now!”Women and gender constituency activists called for environmental integrity, health justice, climate justice, racial justice. “Leaders keep failing us and they will keep failing us because they just don’t have what it needs to get it done. Let’s fight back harder and unite stronger and smash the patriarchy,” one of the activists said during the plenary. Activists and delegates also walked out of COP26 in solidarity with the cause of climate justice.Negotiations may extend to Saturday“This is our collective moment in history. It is our chance to forge a clean, prosperous world. We must rise to the occasion,” said Alok Sharma, COP 26 President during a stocktaking plenary on Friday afternoon. He said many texts are not totally clean, brackets continue despite extensive discussions with ministers and delegates on Thursday night. He hoped that these issues are resolved by late Friday evening. During stocktaking, developed countries like Canada, Norway, the EU, among others, said they prefer stronger language on mitigation particularly on the 1.5 degrees C goal.European Commission in-charge of the European Green Deal, Frans Timmermans, said, there is better compromise on Article 6 in Glasgow than in Madrid (COP25) indicating that the markets rulebook may be closed in Glasgow. Saudi Arabia negotiator said during the plenary that the draft text is attempting to rewrite the Paris Agreement by focusing only on certain aspects of it. “1.5 degrees C goal is a no brainer. Nobody in this room has disagreed. But how and on what grounds? Where are the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities? Without technology, finance this ambition is not equitable.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cop26-draft-text-makes-certain-compromises-continues-to-recognise-1-5-degree-goal-101636713945170.html
13-11-2021||World||Canada set to welcome record number of permanent residents from India this year||More than five months of a ban on direct flights from India does not appear to have dampened the enthusiasm of Indians seeking to settle in Canada, with new data showing that Indian immigration expected to set a new record this year. The Covid-19 pandemic led to a steep decline in Indians attaining permanent resident (PR) status in Canada last year, but there has been a surge in those numbers in 2021 with 69,014 Indian nationals becoming permanent residents by the end of August this year.By comparison, the figure for all of 2020 was 37,125. And the trend for 2021 indicates that the intake numbers for the year will be higher than the previous all-time high of 84,114, which was set in 2019.One of the reason is that the government has been pushing for proving a pathway to permanent residence for those already in Canada since May this year, when Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) announced three streams to enable that process. Under that process, IRCC said it would accept 20,000 applications for temporary workers in the healthcare sector, 30,000 applications for temporary workers in other selected essential occupations, and 40,000 applications for international students who graduated from a Canadian institution.The 2021 numbers support trend of burgeoning immigration of Indians to Canada in recent years. Indian immigrants accounted for one-fourth of the total permanent residencies granted in 2019, setting a new record at the time. India has been the biggest source country for permanent residents since 2017, when it overtook China, but the numbers have jumped in recent years, with an increase of over 20% between 2018 and 2019.Toronto-based lawyer Ravi Jain, founder of the Canadian Immigration Lawyers’ Association, said part of the reason for the ongoing surge was the impact of the restrictions in the United States under the administration of former president Donald Trump, as well as other magnet countries like Australia closing their borders during the pandemic for a protracted period.“Canada is just seen as a very welcoming country for a lot of families,” he said.In 2020, Canada also set more ambitious immigration targets. The 2021‒2023 Immigration Levels Plan announced then was intended to compensate for the projected shortfall in 2020 due to the travel and other restrictions as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.While the previous plan set targets of 351,000 PRs for 2021 and 361,000 for 2022, these were increased to 401,000 and 411,000.

13-11-2021||World||Chinese President Xi Jinping warns against 'Cold War' in Asia-Pacific||Chinese President Xi Jinping warned Thursday against letting tensions in the Asia-Pacific region cause a relapse into a Cold War mentality.His remarks on the sidelines of the annual summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum came weeks after the U.S., Britain and Australia announced a new security alliance in the region which would see Australia build nuclear submarines. China has harshly criticized the deal.And in a separate illustration of strains within APEC, one Southeast Asian delegate told The Associated Press that the group had so far failed to reach agreement on a U.S. bid to host the 2023 summit due to unmet demands from Russia.Xi spoke in a pre-recorded video to a CEO Summit at APEC, which is being hosted by New Zealand in a virtual format. Xi is scheduled to participate in an online meeting with other Pacific Rim leaders including U.S. President Joe Biden on Saturday.In his speech, Xi said attempts to draw boundaries in the region along ideological or geopolitical lines would fail. His reference to the Cold War echoes Beijing's oft-stated position that the U.S. should abandon that way of thinking in dealing with China.“The Asia-Pacific region cannot and should not relapse into the confrontation and division of the Cold War era,” Xi said.Xi also said the region should make sure to keep supply lines functioning and to continue liberalizing trade and investment.“China will remain firm in advancing reform and opening up so as to add impetus to economic development,” he said.The most pressing task in the region is to make an all-out effort to fight the pandemic and to emerge from its shadow as soon as possible, he said.Meanwhile, the Southeast Asian delegate, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to publicly discuss the issue, said Russia had refused to support the U.S. bid unless some of its diplomats were removed from a U.S. blacklist or allowed to enter the U.S. to participate in the APEC meetings.The delegate said the U.S. is unlikely to agree to Russia’s demands because issues involving America’s security are considered “non-negotiable.” The delegate added that China had stayed silent on the U.S. offer.If the 21 APEC leaders fail to reach a consensus on the U.S. bid by Friday, the delegate said, a paragraph in a draft of the summit communique welcoming the U.S. offer would have to be deleted.New Zealand’s Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahuta said earlier this week that APEC was founded on consensus and that there was not yet a confirmed host for 2023.Human rights lawyer Amal Clooney also spoke at the CEO summit, saying she believed that liberal democracies could improve global human rights by pressuring autocratic nations. She said businesses also needed to play a role.“If you can't battle evil, you can at least try to tackle apathy,” Clooney said. “And if you can't rely on liberal governments to solve global issues, you have to try and inspire the private sector to step in."In all, APEC members account for nearly 3 billion people and about 60% of the world’s GDP. But deep tensions run through the unlikely group of 21 nations and territories that include the U.S., China, Taiwan, Russia, and Australia.Many of the countries in Asia endeavor to balance Chinese and U.S. influences on the economic and geopolitical fronts.China claims vast parts of the South China Sea and other areas and has moved to establish a military presence, building islands in some disputed areas as it asserts its historic claims.Both Taiwan and China have applied to join a Pacific Rim trade pact, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, with Beijing saying it will block Taiwan’s bid on the basis that the democratically governed island refuses to accept that it’s part of communist-ruled China.Officials say they have made significant progress during some 340 preliminary meetings leading up to this week's leaders' meeting. APEC members have agreed to reduce or eliminate many tariffs and border holdups on vaccines, masks and other medical products important to fighting the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-president-xi-jinping-warns-against-cold-war-in-asiapacific-101636631095949.html
13-11-2021||World||France has entered the 5th wave of Covid-19, warns minister||France is experiencing the beginning of the fifth wave of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, the country's health minister Olivier Veran said on Wednesday, triggering fresh worries for those who were hoping to see an imminent end to the infection. During an interview with the TF1 television, the French minister confirmed that his country is now at the beginning of the fifth wave of the pandemic, much like “several [other] neighbouring countries”, adding that the circulation of the virus was accelerating.“Several neighbouring countries are already in a fifth wave of the Covid epidemic, what we are experiencing in France clearly looks like the beginning of a fifth wave,” Veran was quoted as saying by the Reuters news agency in the TF1 interview.France's health ministry registered as many as 11,883 new Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, the second day in a row that the new case tally has remained over 10,000. New coronavirus cases have also seen double-digit percentage increases week-on-week since around mid-October.Warning that Covid-19 infection rates are climbing again in the country, French president Emmanuel Macron said earlier this week that those aged 65 and above in the country will need to show proof of a Covid-19 booster jab to be able to visit restaurants, attend cultural events, and take intercity trains. “From December 15, you [over 65s] will need to provide proof of a booster jab to extend the validity of your health pass,” Macron was quoted as saying by the AFP news agency during an address to the nation.Macron also urged the six million people eligible for the vaccine in France who have not yet even received the first dose to come forward and get the jab. “This is an appeal to responsibility – get vaccinated,” he said. Warning that the pandemic isn't over yet, the French president said that all barrier gestures that protect people from both Covid-19 and other contagious winter diseases should be given more attention at this time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-has-entered-the-5th-wave-of-covid-19-warns-minister-101636599102429.html
13-11-2021||India||Maruti to be allotted 900 acres in Sonepat for units||Chandigarh Automobile giant Maruti Suzuki India Ltd (MSIL) will be allotted about 900 acres at Industrial Model Township (IMT) Kharkhauda in Sonepat for setting up car and motorcycle manufacturing units. The allotment, officials said, will entail an investment of 18,000 crore, one of the biggest in recent times. Officials said the 900 acres being allotted to the auto giant will fetch ₹2,500-2,700 crore for the state exchequer. A decision to this effect was taken during a meeting of the Haryana Enterprise Promotion Board (HEPB) headed by Chief minister ML Khattar in Gurugram on Saturday. MSIL chairman RC Bhargava and top functionaries were also present during the meeting. The country’s largest car manufacturer plans to gradually shift its manufacturing operations from the Gurugram facility to IMT Kharkhauda once the new unit get commissioned. The relocation has been necessitated due to growing congestion and traffic snarls in Gurugram. Officials said the car manufacturing unit will come on 800 acres and the Suzuki motorcycle unit will be set up on 100 acres at IMT Kharkhauda. The finalisation of expansion and relocation plans at IMT Kharkhauda, officials said, were delayed due to issues pertaining to reimbursement of State Goods and Services Tax (SGST) and the newly enacted law providing for 75% reservation for locals in private sector jobs. “We have been able to iron out these issues and a broad agreement has been reached on the incentives to be provided to the company. The minutes are being prepared and will be shared with MSIL,’’ said an official. Chief minister Khattar in a statement said the ongoing talks with Maruti to set up a plant on about 900 acres at Kharkhauda were finalised. “This has been discussed in detail with the senior management of the company. If the company deposits the entire amount within 45 days, then it will be given 10% discount on the total amount as per the policy. Along with this, the company has been given State Goods and Services Tax (SGST) reimbursement for 15 years by the government,’’ he said. The auto major had earlier expressed concern over the enactment of the 75% private sector jobs quota law terming it as a deterrent in finalising expansion plans. “Even though we have got assurances that the criteria for applicability for the Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Act shall be pragmatic and business friendly, the same needs to be formalised. A meeting at the highest level from both sides is necessary to close this critical issue,’’ the company had written to the state government a few months back. In a measure to placate the industry, the state government had last week reduced the upper limit of gross monthly salary for jobs which will come under the ambit of the private sector jobs quota law. As per a notification, jobs having a gross monthly salary of not more than ₹30,000 will be up for hiring from amongst local candidates. The company brass subsequently expressed satisfaction over the reduction in the upper limit.The state government also plans to exempt firms and establishments which come into being after the commencement of the law on January 15, 2022 from hiring 75% local candidates for a year. Also, any hiring from within (internal hiring) by a company or an establishment will be exempted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maruti-to-be-allotted-900-acres-in-sonepat-for-units-101636828191741.html

He added that growth can only happen when the society accepts the fact that cows and buffaloes are important gateways, and not just via government’s schemes and gaushalas (shelters).“As women have entered this sphere (veterinary science), and will be treating cows, buffaloes and other animals, I am sure that going ahead, if not immediately, we will certainly succeed (in strengthening the economy of the state and India),” he told a gathering in Hindi.

The UP assembly polls are slated to be held early next year. After launching the third phase of his Samajwadi Vijay Yatra with a massive roadshow in Madapur area on the outskirts of Gorakhpur city, Yadav said, “This great excitement, enthusiasm and support that too in Babaji’s (a reference to CM Yogi Adityanath) region shows that this government (BJP) is on its way out as it has insulted and cheated people. No one has ever made such large numbers of fake promises as this government has done.” He further claimed that the SP would come to power with a huge mandate and that the change will start from Gorakhpur. Taking a swipe at the CM, Akhilesh said, “Do you know why laptops are not being distributed? Because our Babaji doesn’t know how to use one.”The yatra sees the SP chief travel on a bus, which has been converted into a ‘rath’. Akhilesh Yadav addresses people from atop this ‘rath’ and he also waved a mace to people as a victory gesture. Attacking the BJP government over its “failure” in handling the pandemic, the former UP CM alleged, “Do you remember how our labourers walked home in huge numbers from various parts of the country, including Gujarat and Maharashtra? However, this government did nothing for them.”“Back then, the poor desperately needed hospitals, medicines and oxygen but the government failed to supply them, leading to uncountable deaths. Even today, this government has not been able to provide proper treatment to the poor,” he further alleged.On rising fuel prices, the SP leader said, “In the last three months, the profit earned by oil companies has gone up to six hundred times. Can BJP reveal where all this money is going? This is the BJP which is filling the pockets of the rich by cutting the pockets of the poor. They have sold off public properties from airport to railways. It was already a ‘Pheku Sarkar’ (a government which does rhetoric) which has now become a ‘Bechu Sarkar’ (a government which is selling off public properties).” “The (BJP) government had promised that it will make air travel so cheap that even those who wear slippers only will be able to travel in planes. Leave alone the affordable plane travel, the common man is finding it difficult to use even a motorcycle as petrol prices have crossed the ₹100-mark,” the SP chief said.Supporting the farmers’ ongoing agitation against the Centre’s three farm laws, the former CM said, “This government is not listening to the demands of the farmers who have been staging a demonstration for a long time as the government doesn’t worry about them but about its rich friends. If this government comes to power again, it will crush the farmers’ movement.”Seeking people’s support for his party, he also said the forthcoming UP election would be a battle to save all four pillars of democracy and the Indian Constitution. The former Uttar Pradesh chief minister began his Samajwadi Vijay Yatra on October 12 in Kanpur which ended on October 13, covering Kanpur Dehat, Jalaun and Hamirpur. The second phase, meanwhile, was held in Hardoi on October 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/massive-support-on-up-cm-s-home-turf-indication-of-bjp-govt-s-exit-says-akhilesh-yadav-101636824350436.html
13-11-2021||India||Two terrorist organisations claim responsibility for Manipur ambush attack||Two terrorist organisations have claimed responsibility for the ambush attack on an Assam Rifles unit wherein the commanding officer, his wife and son, along with four personnel were killed earlier in the day, news agency PTI reported.In a joint statement, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and the Manipur Naga People's Front (MNPF) claimed the responsibility of the brutal attack carried out in Manipur's Churachandpur district.Colonel Viplav Tripathi, the commanding officer of Khuga Battalion of Assam Rifles along with his personnel riflemen NK Nayak, Suman Swargiary, RP Meena and Shyamal Das lost their lives in the brutal attack. Tripathi's wife and six-year-old son were also among the deceased persons.The attack happened at around 10am, with the militants first causing an improvised explosive device (IED) blast on the single-lane street, and later opening fire on the convoy. The incident took place when Tripathi and the personnel were coming back from his forward company base to the battalion headquarters, officials said.The terror attack was first confirmed by Manipur chief minister N Biren Singh on Twitter, who said that the perpetrators will be “brought to justice.” Later, he also informed about visiting one jawan, who was admitted tp Shija Hospital in Manipur's capital Imphal after sustaining serious injuries in the attack.Meanwhile, government sources told news agency ANI that security has been beefed up on Myanmar border and close watch is kept on the region. This development came after Singh said that paramilitary forces and commandos have launched a combing operation to nab the culprits.The news of the attack sent shockwaves across the political sphere of the country with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, President Ram Nath Kovind, Union home minister Amit Shah and Union defence minister Rajnath Singh, among others condemning the attack.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-militant-organisations-claim-responsibility-of-manipur-ambush-attack-101636821999053.html
13-11-2021||India||‘Reports of vandalisation of a mosque in Tripura’s Gomati fake’, says govt||The Union government claimed news reports detailing an alleged incident of vandalisation of a mosque in Kakraban area of Gomati district in Tripura are “fake” and a “complete misrepresentation of facts”.“These news reports are fake and are a complete misrepresentation of facts. The mosque in Dargabazar area of Kakraban has not been damaged and the Tripura Police in Gomati district is working to maintain peace and tranquillity,” the government said in an official press release.Reports of vandalisation began doing the rounds on social media following which Tripura Police released a statement in which it said, “This is a complete misrepresentation of facts. The mosque in Dargabazar area of Kakraban is completely fine & Gomati police is working to maintain peace and tranquillity.”Communal tension flared in the northeastern state after the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) took out a rally in north Tripura’s Dharmanagar following which a mosque was allegedly vandalised in Panisagar sub-division and homes of those belonging to the Muslim community were also damaged. Police imposed Section 144 in the concerned area to bring the situation under control.The Centre, however, claimed all such reports were untrue. “There is no reported case of damage to the structure of any Masjid in Tripura in the recent past. There is no report of simple or grievous injury or rape or death of any person in these incidents as alleged in some social media posts," it said.Tripura police booked at least 102 social media account holders, including 68 Twitter handles, under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) for allegedly distorting news on communal violence.The press release also mentioned the violent incident in Maharashtra’s Amravati, where Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) took out a protest against a bandh called by members of the Muslim community to protest against the violence in Tripura, which led to massive crowds surging onto the roads, shouting slogans, carrying banners and saffron flags. Some sections of the protest began pelting stones at private and government vehicles, shops and establishments, forcing the police to resort to mild caning.“People should maintain calm and should not be misguided by such fake reports. For instance, in Maharashtra, there have been reports of violence and unsavoury statements that are aimed at disturbing peace and harmony, based on fake news regarding Tripura. This is very concerning and it is urged that peace is maintained at all costs,” the government press release cautioned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/reports-of-vandalisation-of-a-mosque-in-tripura-s-gomati-fake-says-govt-101636823555957.html

The meeting comes after Reserve Bank of India governor Shaktikanta Das cautioned investors about the digital currency. Attempts to mislead the youth through over-promising and non-transparent advertising have to be stopped, it was discussed in the meeting."It was also discussed that unregulated crypto markets cannot be let to become avenues for money laundering and terror financing," the report said.The government will keep a close watch on cryptocurrency as this is an evolving technology will take proactive steps, it said.The meeting was an outcome of a "consultative process as RBI, finance ministry, the home ministry had done an elaborate exercise on it as well as consulted experts from across the country and the world," reports said. India is also going through the global examples and the best practices regarding crypto.In future, the Centre will take forward-looking and progressive steps regarding crypto, it was discussed and decided. "Since the issue cuts across individual countries' borders, it was felt that it will also require global partnerships and collective strategies," the report said.The RBI has a strong view of cryptocurrencies and sees them as a threat to the macroeconomic and financial stability of the country. It has also questioned the claimed market value of crypto and the number of investors trading on them. A report of RBI's internal panel on crypto is also expected to be submitted next month.The Supreme Court in early March 2020 had nullified the RBI circular banning cryptocurrencies. Following this on February 5, 2021, RBI instituted an internal panel to suggest a model of the central bank's digital currency. RBI said it wants to come up with its own official digital currency to combat the rise of the cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin against which it has reservations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-pm-modi-s-meet-on-crypto-concerns-expressed-over-terror-financing-misleading-youth-101636820163988.html
13-11-2021||India||Col, kin among 7 killed in Manipur ambush near Myanmar border; India vows strong response||Armed militants on Saturday ambushed an Assam Rifles convoy near the porous India-Myanmar border in Manipur’s Churachandpur district; killing five soldiers including a colonel, his wife, their eight-year-old son, and injuring six personnel of whom four are critical and battling for their lives at a medical facility in the state, people familiar with the developments said. The commanding officer of the 46 Assam Rifles, Colonel Viplav Tripathi, and his quick reaction team (QRT) were returning from the Behiang border post and heading to the battalion headquarters at Khuga when the militants ambushed them at S Sehken village under Singhat sub-division at around 11 am, said one of the officials cited above. Apart from Tripathi, his wife Anuja and son Abeer; Riflemen NK Nayak, Suman Swargiary, RP Meena and Shyamal Das were killed in the pre-planned attack. Family members of soldiers being hit by insurgents is a rarity and has sent shock waves through the military community. In May 2002, terrorists killed 31 people at an army base in Jammu and Kashmir’s Kaluchak area. The casualties were three soldiers, 18 family members (including a two-month-old baby girl) and 10 civilians. The 47 wounded were 12 soldiers, 20 family members and 15 civilians.The attackers first triggered an improvised explosive device (IED) on the single-lane road in a densely forested area and then brought the Assam Rifles personnel under heavy automatic fire to inflict maximum casualties, bringing back memories of the June 2015 Chandel ambush in the state in which a Dogra battalion of the Indian Army lost 18 men, said a second official. Five days after the Dogra unit was attacked in broad daylight in the Moltuk Valley, India’s Special Forces responded with a cross-border raid into Myanmar where they targeted and destroyed two insurgent camps. Security forces on Saturday launched a massive manhunt for the insurgents but they may have slipped across the porous border into Myanmar. Tripathi’s unit, 46 Assam Rifles, had disrupted several drug trafficking rings in the area and may have been targeted by the insurgents because of its successes in curbing the illegal money-spinning trade, HT has learnt. The aftershocks of the hit were felt in New Delhi with the government vowing strong and swift action against the insurgents. Prime Minister Narendra Modi condemned the attack and paid homage to the soldiers and family members who lost their lives in the ambush. “Their sacrifice will never be forgotten. My thoughts are with the bereaved families in this hour of sadness,” the PM wrote on Twitter. Defence minister Rajnath Singh said the perpetrators of the attack would be brought to justice swiftly. “The cowardly attack on an Assam Rifles convoy is extremely painful and condemnable. The nation has lost five brave soldiers including CO 46 AR and two family members. My condolences to the bereaved families,” Singh said. State chief minister N Biren Singh said security forces had launched a hunt for the militants and they would be brought to justice. No insurgent group has so far claimed responsibility for the attack but the People’s Liberation Army of Manipur and People’s Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak (PREPAK) are among the outfits suspected to be involved, said a fourth official. At least half a dozen main insurgent groups are active in the state including PLA, PREPAK, Kanglei Yawol Kanna Lup, Kangleipak Communist Party, Kuki National Army and Kuki National Front. “Insurgents may have carried out the attack to impose caution on the Assam Rifles as this unit (46 Assam Rifles) was extremely successful in busting drug-trafficking networks in the area. These insurgent groups are involved in illegal narcotics trade,” said Lieutenant General Shokin Chauhan (retd), who headed the Assam Rifles in 2017-18. The road on which the ambush took place is one of the alternative routes from Myanmar to Imphal, and is used for drug trafficking. Chauhan doesn’t rule out a Chinese angle to the attack. “The People’s Liberation Army of Manipur is known to be in sync with China. It is within the realm of possibility that it was ordered to carry out the hit to force India to deploy more forces in the area at a time when there’s tension along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China,” he said. Chauhan, a counter-insurgency expert who understands the security dynamics of India’s Northeast, last year retired as the chairman of the Ceasefire Monitoring Group responsible for implementing ceasefire ground rules between the Centre and Naga insurgent groups. He added that the attackers would have known that civilians were part of the Assam Rifles convoy but still carried out the hit. According to figures obtained by HT in 2018, the average annual operations launched by the army and Assam Rifles in Manipur involve setting up 52,000 check posts, 42,000 patrols, more than 10,000 ambushes and 550 special operations.Improvised explosive devices (IEDs) are one of the biggest challenges confronting soldiers deployed in insurgency-hit Manipur and mitigating that threat is a top priority for the security forces. The predominant weapon of insurgent groups, IEDs have killed, maimed or injured hundreds of soldiers in India’s north-east, including Manipur, over the last three decades. The vast area that the security forces operate in, the state’s topography and a 398-km porous border with Myanmar are among the challenges faced by soldiers who operate from 180 bases scattered across Manipur, officials said. The IEDs came to prominence in the Northeast, including Manipur, in 1990, when insurgents began emulating the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. The latest ambush comes at a time when the security situation in the North-east had improved significantly in the army’s assessment, and a planned and gradual drawdown of soldiers is underway there. In February 2021, army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane said two army divisions had been pulled out of counter-insurgency and internal security duties in the Northeast, and were solely focused on their operational role along the China border. Several parliamentary panels have made recommendations in their reports to reduce the army’s exposure to counter-insurgency and counterterrorism duties because it results in blunting the force’s focus on its main task - defending the country from external aggression.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/col-kin-among-7-killed-in-manipur-ambush-near-myanmar-border-india-vows-strong-response-101636820150131.html

"Sometimes language in which our response as lawyers is given might create a wrong message, that wasn't the intention," Mehta said.In reply, the CJI said he considers this as his drawback that he is not a "very sophisticated speaker". "Unfortunately I am not a very sophisticated speaker Mr Mehta, that is my drawback. I learnt this English in class 8th", the CJI said. The solicitor general said he himself learnt English in Class 8 and studied in Gujarati medium till graduation.The CJI, according to the report, replied that his schooling was in Telugu medium and he only studied law in English medium. "I never knew the similarities between me and CJI. I am really proud of it," Mehta said to Livelaw later.The Supreme Court on Saturday expressed grave concern over the Delhi pollution situation. As the solicitor general referred to the stubble burning issue, the CJI said, "You are projecting as if farmers are responsibile..what about the Delhi people? What about the steps to regulate firecrackers, vehicular emissions?" he said.The SG said he did not want to suggest that farmers are responsible for the pollution. "Please don't take it that government, state or Centre is putting this on farmers. There's not a remote intention of suggesting that," he said adding that he was only taking the bench through the issues one by one and other issues will be highlighted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-learnt-english-in-8th-standard-says-chief-justice-same-replies-solicitor-general-101636818097473.html

It has directed states and union territories to prepare a list of such people in every district.The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) has written a letter to all states and union territories on September 22 and is awaiting responses. This information was told to the Supreme Court in an affidavit filed by the Union Health Ministry while responding to a PIL filed by NGO Evara Foundation seeking ease of access for disabled persons to get Covid-19 vaccination. One of the prayers sought in this petition was to enable doorstep vaccination of persons with disabilities who face difficulty to either access the CoWIN digital interface or the Covid-19 vaccination centres.“Vaccination at home has its own logistic and medical complexities,” the Union government said, adding “the MoHFW recognizes that despite efforts made, there may still be some people who might be bed-ridden or have extremely restricted mobility or disability and/or special needs that may hamper their accessibility even to near-to-home Covid vaccination centres (NHCVC).”In its advisory issued on September 22, the Centre has asked states/UTs to prepare a “line-list of all such potential beneficiaries and their care-givers” and to collate this list at the district level. Subsequent to this information being gathered, the Centre said, “Best efforts would be employed on case to case basis, considering logistic and medical exigencies, for facilitating vaccination of all such beneficiaries at their place of residence using mobile vaccination teams.” A nodal officer has also been designated in each district for this purpose by MoHFW to oversee the implementation.On Saturday, the PIL was taken up by for hearing by a bench of Justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and AS Bopanna where Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Aishwarya Bhati appeared for the Centre. Bhati informed the Court that Covid-19 vaccination centres were arranged near to homes of people above 60 and those faced with disabilities. Under this scheme, nearly 17.26 crore vaccine doses have been administered in a short span of four months, from May 27 (when the scheme was launched) till September 27, ASG Bhati said.Advocate Pankaj Sinha who appeared for petitioner organization questioned the data on disabled persons getting vaccinated when there was no mechanism either under CoWIN or at the Covid vaccination centres to identify persons with disabilities. As the bench had not gone through the affidavit, the matter was posted to Thursday.On the previous hearing on September 20 when notice was issued on the PIL, the Court noted four areas of concern – doorstep vaccination for persons with disability and their caregivers, preference for scheduling vaccination slots, accessibility of CoWIN web portal and mobile app for persons with disabilities, and scheduling of vaccinations through a dedicated helpline number other than CoWIN portal or app. The bench was concerned as persons with disabilities have rights protected under the Right of Persons with Disability Act 2016 which follows the principle of “reasonable accommodation”.The PIL had said that Section 25 of the 2016 Act provided for “barrier free accessibility of medical facilities” for persons with disability. It stated that disabled persons should not be required to visit the vaccination centres due to the risk of getting exposed to COVID infection as such persons cannot maintain social distancing and those with psychological disabilities cannot ensure use of face masks and face shields for their protection. The petition urged the Court to direct for door-to-door vaccination on priority basis pointing out that the Indian Council of Medical Research had already recommended for doorstep vaccination. The states of Jharkhand and Kerala have already implemented this policy, the petition stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-mulling-doorstep-vaccination-for-bed-ridden-disabled-health-ministry-to-sc-101636816129709.html
13-11-2021||India||‘National Achievement Survey to facilitate new strategies, policies in post-pandemic era’: Educationists||The Centre on Friday conducted the National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2021 across the country and as per the initial estimate from 24 states and Union territories (UTs), 96% of schools and 92% of the targeted sampled students participated in the survey, Union ministry of education said. Experts and educationists dubbed the survey as crucial for the post-pandemic era.The survey, which assesses the competencies developed by the students at the grade levels of 3rd, 5th, 8th and 10th, is conducted after every three years. Around 3.8 million students from 1, 23,000 schools in 733 districts were scheduled to participate in the survey. “National Achievement Survey 2021 has been conducted successfully across the country, with the enthusiastic participation of schools and students. As per the initial estimates received from 24 states/UTs, nearly 96% of the sampled schools and nearly 92% of the targeted sampled children, of classes 3, 5, 8 and 10 participated in the survey,” the ministry said.The survey was last conducted in 2017 and was scheduled to take place in 2020. However, due to the Covid-19 situation, it was postponed till this year.This was the first time when private schools have been included in the NAS for grades 3, 5 and 8. Earlier, private schools were included for the class 10 NAS. The education ministry said that the survey will help to assess the learning interruptions and new learning during the Covid-19 pandemic and help in taking remedial measures.“NAS 2021 is the first achievement survey after the release of National Education Policy 2020 (NEP). The assessment would be used to benchmark students’ learning against criteria such as process skills and learning outcomes. NAS 2021 will infuse the competency-based assessment system over the content and memory-based assessment as envisaged by the NEP 2020,” the ministry added.Apart from students, subject teachers and school principals also participated in the survey on Friday. Tania Joshi, principal of the Indian School in Delhi, one of the centres, said, “There were questions like how did covid affect the education system and if we think that if the learning took a backseat because of online teaching. It also sought details about basic infrastructure and facilities at the school. The survey will be really helpful in making strategies and policies in the post-pandemic era.”In Punjab, as many as 1,31,000 students from 3,722 schools were scheduled to take part in the NAS 2021. Officials said at least 7,000 students appeared for the exam in 208 government and private schools in Ludhiana district alone.Officials in Tamil Nadu said that the survey was conducted in only some districts since most of the schools have been closed following heavy rainfall causing floods in parts of the state.In Tripura, 95.25% of the 38,760 respondents in 898 schools turned up for the NAS, officials said. “We received good responses during the survey. Our observers and field investigators went to their respective destinations on Thursday, i.e a day before the survey. And the survey was done hassle-free,” said an official of SCERT of Tripura.Officials in Assam said that the survey was conducted smoothly in the state. “In Assam, besides 74 CBSE schools, state-government run schools also took part. Since several of these schools are located in remote areas, the officials in those centres would be able to provide details of attendance only by Saturday. There was no online option of registering details of students or attendance. Hence the delay is expected,” said KK Choudhury, regional director at NAS control centre of CBSE’s Guwahati office.In Chandigarh, officials said that around 90% of students turned up for the test on Friday. As many as 5,800 students from 106 schools were expected to appear for the test. “The schools had been open for classes for a while now so it wasn’t a big deal for students to come to school and take the exam. Over 90% attendance is expected,” a senior official said, adding they are yet to compile the final data.In Uttarakhand, over 20,000 students in 2,630 schools took part in the NAS on Friday, said Banshidhar Tiwari, director general education of the state.According to the Maharashtra SCERT, till 7 pm, various districts reported attendance of students between 91 to 95%. There were, however, 12 districts in the state which were yet to submit the data by the time this report was filed.In Madhya Pradesh, 2,43,601 out of 2, 700,24 enrolled students across 9,499 schools took part in the NAS on Friday. “The NAS was conducted smoothly at all the schools. More than 90% of the students took the exam.” said school education department public relations officer Amitabh Anurag.Meanwhile, in West Bengal, where schools have not been reopened yet, teachers said they witnessed several issues. “The timing of the test was not proper. Teachers were asked to come to school almost two hours before students arrived. The students were asked to report around 9 am. Some students and teachers stay very far from the school. They had great difficulty in reaching the school on time,” said Sandip Kumar Pal, an English teacher in Kolkata. Educationist Meet Sengupta said that the survey will be crucial after the pandemic. “The NAS conducted after a tough year of pandemic lockdowns in schools will not be a measure that is useful for tracking education trends but it will help us in getting an understanding of the learning lag. It is, and should be used only as an outlier, not as a measure of the regular education system,” she said.(With inputs from state bureaus)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/national-achievement-survey-to-facilitate-new-strategies-policies-in-post-pandemic-era-educationists-101636816071391.html

The Army headquarters is closely monitoring the situation and Army chief general MM Naravane has been briefed on the ambush, government sources told news agency ANI. Operations have been launched in the area of the attack to nab the terrorists involved. The border is on the close watch so that the terrorists can't escape, reports said.No terrorist organisation has so far claimed responsibility for the attack, though Manipur-based People's Liberation Army is suspected to be behind the attack. Colonel Viplav Tripathi, his wife and son were among the seven killed in the attack that took place on Saturday morning when the colonel was going to supervise a civic action programme in Churachandpur district, bordering Myanmar.The area where the terror strike took place is also close to the border.The terrorists first carried out an IED attack on the convoy and then a firefight between the soldiers and the terrorists ensued. It is not yet known whether the terrorists suffered any casualties.Saturday's terror attack is the first major attack on security forces since June 4, 2018 when an Army convoy was similarly targeted in Chandel district resulting in the death of 18 personnel and injury to others, PTI reported. Since then, terror activities abated in the state.The Assam Rifles said it suspected the People's Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak behind the attack as the PREPAK remembrance day is celebrated on 12/13 November.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/manipur-terror-attack-close-watch-on-myanmar-border-army-chief-general-briefed-on-ambush-101636814561688.html
13-11-2021||India||HT THIS DAY: November 14, 1983 — Sunil Gavaskar is highest-ever run-getter in history of Test cricket||Ahmedabad- Master batsman Sunil Gavaskar had his tryst with manifest destiny today when he became the leading scorer of runs in the history of Test cricket. Gavaskar’s sparkling knock of 90 not only erased the existing record of 8114 runs by Geoff Boycott but also helped India finish the second day of the third Test in a sound position. Though the afternoon became quite memorable for the capacity 50,000 fans at the Gujarat Stadium, it would have been a unique occasion for the stalwart Indian opener had he got the necessary ten more runs to emerge as the all-time record holder of the highest number of centuries in Test cricket. As it turned out, Gavaskar narrowly failed to overhaul the total of 29 centuries which he shares with Don Bradman. It was a thoroughly professional piece of batting from Gavaskar which lasted 182 minutes and which contained 13 thundering fours that silenced the dreaded West Indies pace battery for a major part of the afternoon.As the result of the most impressive start given by Gavaskar and Anshuman Gaekwad, India were 173 for two in reply to West Indies first innings total of 281 when stumps were drawn after a prolonged final session which was extended to allow the stipulated number of overs to be completed. The pair put on 127 runs in 153 minutes before the persevering Michael Holding struck twice and removed both the openers in a spell of 38 balls conceding only 10 runsGavaskar’s command performance completely overshadowed yet another valuable knock, this time from West Indies wicketkeeper Jeff Dujon who missed his maiden Test century by just two runs. It was the bearded Dujon who led a resolute rearguard action aided by tailenders Holding and Davis which saw the West Indies reach a respectable total from the overnight score of 209 for eight.Dujon struck 14 forceful boundaries in a stay of 192 minutes before he committed the only error which resulted in his dismissal. A sudden rush of blood ended his sedate knock when Kapil Dev easily accepted a mistimed drive off left-arm spinner Shastri. Overnight on 44, Dujon was the last man out in the West Indies innings. At the close, Test debutant Navjot Sidhu, who came in at one drop, and Sandip Patil were together. Both Sidhu and Patil had some luck but they realised the importance of staying there to build up a lead for India and batted on a cautious note. Sidhu showed great sense, keeping his bat and pad together and his head over the line of the ball. In attack, he attempted only those strokes which he knew he could play - through the covers and off his toes. Sidhu had a narrow escape from the second ball he faced after he had taken a single off Holding. An edged shot off Davis dropped just short of Lioyds grasp at first slip. Patil on five was let off by Haynes at short leg off Marshall. Patil seemed to loose his patience at one stage before he checked himself and saw the day through. On a day when the spotlight was once Main on Gavaskar, the opener decided to play some exciting shots and at times verged on cheekiness. Yet he flicked and drove the West Indies pace quartet with admirable ease as the catalogue of boundaries speak for themselves. He struck the first two balls from Marshall who commenced the attack to extra-cover and midwicket boundaries. That set the pattern for the rest of his innings. When on 54, Gavaskar completed one thousand runs in a calendar year for the fourth time. Later when he took a single off Holding to reach 83 he bettered Boycott s existing mark of aggregate runs. This was his 96th Test and 168th innings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-this-day-november-14-1983-sunil-gavaskar-is-highest-ever-run-getter-in-history-of-test-cricket-101636812049684.html
13-11-2021||India||India was ‘partially a Muslim nation’ under Congress rule, BJP claims||Keeping up its attack on the Congress over the opposition party's criticism of Hindutva, the BJP claimed on Saturday that India was partially a "Muslim nation" when it was in power as sharia provisions were then part of the legal system and measures were taken to give them primacy even over Supreme Court judgment.BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi alleged that the violence in Maharashtra over the "false" news of mosques being targeted in Tripura, disinformation campaign in social media and Congress leaders' comments attacking Hindutva were part of a larger conspiracy against Hinduism.Attacking Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, he wondered if the opposition leader was training his party workers in Maharashtra in defaming Hindutva and driving an organised campaign to stoke communal discord and violence.It was during his speech via video conferencing to Congress workers at a training camp in the state that Gandhi had sought to draw a distinction between Hinduism and Hindutva, and had attacked the latter.The BJP has been on the offensive after Congress leader Salman Khurshid compared Hindutva, a term associated with the RSS-BJP ideology, with terrorist Islamist organisations.Trivedi said the Congress symbolises politics of appeasement and spreads hate against Hinduism and causes riots.Noting that Shivaji's rule was also associated with Hinduism, Trivedi said leaders like Rahul Gandhi cannot comprehend the concept and asked him to read up his own party stalwarts like Mahatma Gandhi, Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Jawaharlal Nehru.Nehru, he added, had written that the word 'Hindu' can be understood in the broader context of Indian identity and should not be seen narrowly."Under the Congress rule India was partially a Muslim nation. I am saying so because sharia provisions were part of the constitutional system," the BJP leader said, referring to the practice like instant talaq, now barred, and grant of Haj subsidy, since discontinued."Supreme Court judgment was overruled to give primacy to sharia provisions," Trivedi said in an apparent reference to the Rajiv Gandhi government bringing a law to override an apex court order in the famous Shah Bano case.Before the Modi government took office and with the exception of the Vajpayee dispensation, India was partially a Muslim nation under the Congress' rule and the party is now becoming desperate as India is now turning secular in a real way, he claimed.He took a swipe at Congress leaders for giving their "wisdom" on Hinduism and referred to their use of terms like Hindu Taliban and Hindi terrorism to hit out at them.These are the same people who do not want a proud India to bloom in all its glory, and are trying to stop its rise, he claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-was-partially-a-muslim-nation-under-congress-rule-bjp-claims-101636811100491.html

In Neyyattinkara (Thiruvananthapuram district) a portion of a bridge on the National Highway 66 caved in disrupting traffic and in Vizinjam many shops and houses were submerged after the Gangayar stream overflowed. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has sounded a red alert in Thiruvananthapuram district and an orange alert in six other districts. It also said rainfall will continue for three more days and strong winds with a speed of 50 km per hour is likely to prevail over the Kerala coast. A red alert is sounded if rainfall is over 20 cm in 24 hours, orange alert for 11 cm to 20 cm and yellow alert means rainfall lies between 6 to 11 cm. Thiruvananthapuram district collector Navjot Khosa has banned travelling in hilly areas and asked people to avoid travel if it is not urgent. No casualty was reported so far though many houses and agricultural fields were ravaged by gushing water. Some areas in the district received 30 cm of rain in the last 24 hours. Many dams in southern Kerala are filled to the brim and people living on the banks of water bodies have been asked to keep utmost vigil by the district administration. Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, who is attending the party politburo meet in Delhi, took to Facebook asking people to stay alert.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/heavy-rain-batters-south-kerala-rail-traffic-disrupted-due-to-landslides-101636811091512.html

Referring to an attack on his convoy in Azamgarh over a decade ago, Adityanath said that no one can think of repeating such acts under the current government. Shah also targeted the previous SP-led government, saying Azamgarh was “known for radicalisation” but will now be known for education.“Azamgarh is witnessing transformation under Yogi government. 'Mafia-raj' has ended under CM Adityanath,” he added.Hitting back at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders, Akhilesh Yadav said that the ruling party has deceived the people and is responsible for defaming Azamgarh. The former Uttar Pradesh chief minister also mentioned the Yogi Adityanath government’s move to withdraw criminal cases against Adityanath.“BJP does politics of 'destruction not development'. It has deceived the people... If anyone is defaming Azamgarh, it's BJP...The way they (BJP) killed a trader, it brought bad name to the district. He (CM) had cases against him, he withdrew them,” ANI quoted Akhilesh Yadav as saying.Amit Shah hits out at Akhilesh with new ‘Jinnah’ wordplay Taking potshots at the UP CM, Yadav said that the state needs a ‘Yogya Sarkar’ (an able government) not ‘Yogi Sarkar’ (Yogi government). The Samajwadi chief further stated that a chief minister should be able to operate a laptop and the internet, claiming that Adityanath doesn’t even know how to operate a phone.“A 'Yogya Sarkar' is the need in UP, not 'Yogi Sarkar'.

It also pulled up the central government over farm fires, highlighting that the machinery available for stubble management is too expensive for poor and marginalised farmers to purchase.A bench comprising Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana, Justice DY Chandrachud and Justice Surya Kant suggested imposing a two-day lockdown in the national capital, saying that the air quality in the city is expected to drop even further in the next two to three days.According to data collected from heat-sensing satellites by Hindustan Times, farm fire emissions in the second week of November have hit a record high this year. As many as 24,694 fire events occurred this year, beating the previous high recorded in the same period in 2016 with 16,931 incidents.Also Read | ‘Don’t know why Centre is silent’: Gopal Rai on Delhi air pollutionOn Saturday, the apex court also questioned the Delhi government over its decisions to install smog towers, and told the Centre at the same time that blaming the farmers has “become a fashion” when air pollution in the capital increases.The matter has now been posted for Monday.Here are top 10 quotes of the SC bench after today’s hearing:1.     “Tell us how we can reduce AQI from 500 at least by 200 points. Take some urgent measures. Can you think of two days lockdown or something? How can people live? We will look at a long-term solution later.”2.     “You have to look at this issue beyond politics and government. Something must happen so that in two to three days we feel better.”3.     On Delhi government’s decision to install smog towers, the bench asked, “This is not the Centre's but your jurisdiction. What is happening on that front?”4.     “Be the petitioners, the Delhi government or anybody else -- it has become a fashion to blame the farmers. Have you seen how crackers are being burnt in Delhi for the last seven days? What was the Delhi police doing?”5.     “You are saying two lakh machines are available, but the poor farmers cannot afford these machines. After the agrarian laws, the landholding in UP, Punjab and Haryana are less than 3 acres. We can't expect those farmers to purchase those machines.”6. “Why can't the Centre and the state governments provide the machines. Take away the stubble for use in paper mills and various other purposes. In winters the stubble can be used for fodder for goats, etc. in Rajasthan.”7.     After Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the court that the Centre is providing machinery at 80 per cent subsidised rate, the bench asked, “Can the farmer afford it. I am a farmer and I know it, the CJI is also from a farmer family he also knows it.”8.     “Problem is of incentivisation. If you are not giving incentives to farmers for alternatives then things cannot change. Enforcement cannot happen just like that.”9.     “How do we ensure that stubble is removed, in time and taken to thermal power plant and then economic remuneration to farmers?”10. “Schools have been opened now and little children are on the roads and we are exposing them to this. [AIIMS director] Dr [Randeep] Guleria said we are exposing them to pollution, pandemic and dengue.”(With inputs from PTI and Bar and Bench)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-air-pollution-top-10-quotes-of-supreme-court-bench-led-by-cji-ramana-101636806692265.html
13-11-2021||India||India has sequenced over 100,000 viral genomes as part of its surveillance effort||At least 100,000 genomes of the Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has been sequenced by the consortium of laboratories that keep an eye out for variants that might lead to a surge in infection. The Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG), which consists of 10 central laboratories and 28 regional ones, has sequenced 115,101 samples since January this year. Of the total samples, over 65,000 samples were assigned lineages by the Pangolin software used by the researchers to determine which variant family they belong to. Of these, 69% of samples are known variants of interest (VOI) or variants of concern (VOC), according to the latest bulletin of the consortium. At present, delta and its sub-lineage continue to be the dominant variant. “Delta (B.1.617.2 and AY.x) continues to be the main VOC in India. No new VOI or VOC are noted and other VOC and VOI other than Delta are now negligible in sequencing data from India,” the bulletin states. A previous bulletin had clarified the delta sub-lineage AY4.2 that was declared as a variant of interest by the UK was found in 0.1% of the samples. “It is too low to be of a concern at the time,” the bulletin from November 1 states. The original delta variant (B1.617.2) continues to be the most dominant one in India, found in 66% of all the samples sequenced, according to data from outbreak.info, which compiles data from the global GISAID database. Delta is followed by five sub-lineages of it – AY.43 (7%), AY.39 (5%), AY.44 (3%), AY.20 (3%), and AY.33 (2%). In October-end, HT reported that there were 17 genome sequences that were being re-looked by researchers from INSACOG in order to see whether they can be classified as AY4.2. There are two mutations in the spike protein and one in the ORF region of the viral genome; if a sequence contains two of the three mutations coupled with the ones for delta variant they are considered to be AY4.2. The scrutiny around AY.4.2 arose after the latest technical briefing by the Public Health England (PHE) upgraded the variant as being under investigation. The PHE document, dated October 22, said the key decision is based on AY.4.2 having a modestly increased growth rate and a higher secondary rate of attack – the ability to pass the infection on to someone – was higher than Delta’s (12.4% versus 11.1%). Among the total samples that have been assigned lineages so far this year, Alpha accounts for 6.4%, beta 0.33%, gamma 0.003%, delta 43.9%, close relatives of delta (B1.617.1 and B1.617.3) account for 8.2% of the sequences, and the AY sub-lineage of delta accounts for 10%, according to INSACOG data. Dr Ekta Gupta, head of the regional INSACOG laboratory at the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences in Delhi said, “So far, there is no clinical significance of the AY variants that we are seeing. These are also similar to the delta variant that a large proportion of the population has been exposed to, so these are unlikely to cause a huge surge.” Union minister of state for science and technology Dr Jitendra Singh, in a high-level review meeting on the current status of Covid-19 research, took note that over 100,000 samples have been sequenced so far and over 57,000 patient samples have been stored at five bio-repositories across the country that will be made available to researchers and private players for the development of vaccines and therapeutics. “A vaccine testing and research facility will come up at the second campus of the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology (RGCB) and this centre will also have a BSL-3 facility which is capable of handling airborne viruses like Covid-19. This facility will be the first of its kind in South India. The RGCB will be developed as a hub for research and testing of multiple vaccines such as cancer vaccines and those for infectious diseases, including Covid-19. This will bring huge recognition for the RGCB in the specific area of vaccine research and development,” the minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-has-sequenced-over-100-000-viral-genomes-as-part-of-its-surveillance-effort-101636806290597.html

"This is Kangana's 'Independent India," the Congress leader tweeted. Kangana Ranaut thinks :India got independence in 2014 … Yes to :Abuse Tear asunder our social fabricDivide communities Spread fake newsLet loose investigation agenciesFile false casesThis is Kangana’s Independent India !Kangana's comment has kicked up a row and several complaints have been filed against her for insulting India's freedom movement. Though Kangana in his remark credited the BJP as by 2014, she referred to Narendra Modi's becoming the prime minister, BJP leaders have reacted strongly to the comment. Apart from BJP leader Varun Gandhi, Maharashtra BJP chief Chandrakant Patil said Kangana can appreciate PM Modi without criticising the freedom struggle. "Kangana Ranaut's comment on the country's fight for Independence is completely wrong. Nobody has a right to pass a negative remark on the freedom movement," he said.The Congress, which was at the target of Kangana's comment, raised the demand of recall of her Padma Shri to which the actor has replied and said that she would return her award and apologise too if anyone could answer her question. Which was took place in 1947, the actor asked."Just to set the records (sic) straight... 1857 first collective fight for freedom along with sacrifice of greats like Subhash Chandra Bose, Rani Laxmibai and Veer Savarkar ji."...1857 I know but which war took place in 1947 I am not aware, if someone can bring to my awareness I will give back my Padma Shri and apologise also… please help me with this (sic)," the actor posted on her Instagram story."..And why Gandhi let Bhagat Singh die... why Neta Bose was killed and never got Gandhi ji's support? why line of partition was drawn by a white man... ?instead of celebrating freedom why Indians killed each other some of the answers I am seeking please help me find answers (sic)," Kangana wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/divide-communities-kapil-sibal-describes-kangana-ranaut-s-independent-india-101636802137320.html

13-11-2021||India||Remittances barely improving lives of Odisha migrant workers’ families: Survey||The living condition of migrant workers’ families from western Odisha districts has not improved much despite the remittances sent home, generated from labouring in brick kilns or construction sites of southern Indian states, a study by Odisha’s Sambalpur University on migration, remittances and human development in Western Odisha has found.The study by Centre of Excellence Regional Development and Tribal Studies of Sambalpur University revealed that 19.8 per cent of the migrants who were surveyed earned around ₹10,000 per month and 58.6 per cent migrants earned around ₹10,000-15000 per month. Just about 4 per cent earned more than ₹20,000.“Around 97.9% migrant households said they use the remittance to purchase food, followed by purchase of clothes for family members, house electrification, acquire drinking water facility, purchases of television, Cable connection and purchase home appliances. However, 40.7% of the migrant households said their living condition has not improved at all, whereas 36.8% households said their living condition has improved to some extent. Only one fourth of migrant household (22.6%) said that their living condition has improved,” said Prof Arun Acharya of social anthropology department who led the study that was done in the month of July and August this year.The study was done through home visits to 394 households of migrant workers in the 7 western Odisha districts of Bargarh, Sambalpur, Balangir, Jharsuguda, Sundargarh, Subarnapur and Deogarh.Three fourth of total migrants sampled were between the ages of 21 to 35 years. In term of educational qualification, more than 90% migrants had completed secondary, high school and college level education. As the data indicates, majority of people have migrated to Tamil Nadu (46.7%), followed by Andhra Pradesh (13.7%), Karnataka (8.1%) and Telengana (8.1%).Acharya said 58.4% of surveyed migrant households have low level of human development, whereas one fourth (37.6%) migrant households reported medium human development and 4.1% migrant households high human development. “As majority of migrant households perceived that their living condition has not at all improved after migration of their family, it indicates that remittances sent by the migrants of Western Odisha have not contributed much for the improvement of the household living conditions,” said Acharya.Also Read: Odisha questioned about sex racket allegations in Kalahandi SchoolIn 2018 World Bank and Odisha higher education department jointly established a Centre of Excellence on Regional Development and Tribal Studies and one of the main objectives of this centre is to analyse the migration and livelihood pattern of the people of western Odisha.Migration to the southern states like Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala is an annual feature in western Odisha, infamous for poverty. In districts like Bolangir, Nuapada, Bargarh and Sambalpur people start flocking to Kantabanjhi railway station to board two trains heading to Visakhapatnam – the Korba-VSKP Link Express and the Durg-VSKP Passenger.A large study in coastal and western Odisha, coordinated by the Centre for Migration Studies, Ajeevika Bureau in 2014 among 99,523 households found that 30.83 per cent of the total households had one or more members migrating for work. This amounted to an estimated 1.53 million migrants from the region, of which 0.58 million were from Western Odisha. The state labour department has not conducted any studies to find out the scale of annual migration to southern states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/survey-finds-remittances-barely-improving-odisha-migrant-workers-families-lives-101636800711482.html

Here's what health ministry said||The Union ministry of health and family welfare has informed the ministry of civil aviation (MoCA) that meal service can be resumed on flights with less than two hours of journey, reported news agency PTI. The report suggests that MoCA had sought inputs from the health ministry for amending the existing regulations that have barred airlines from providing food to passengers whose air journey is less than two hours.The ban on serving food on flights of less than two hours duration came into effect on April 15 during the devastating second wave of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. The health ministry has said that the crew members no longer need to wear coveralls on the flight but they should continue wearing gloves, masks and face shields, reported PTI citing people familiar with the matter.The scheduled domestic flights were resumed on May 25 last year following two months of nationwide lockdown and in-flight meals were also allowed under certain conditions. During the second wave of the pandemic, the civil aviation ministry, on the suggestion from the health ministry, allowed meals for flights flying for more than two hours, provided the airlines used disposable cutlery and served only pre-packed food."The health ministry has now informed that serving food on flights of less than two hours can be resumed and that the crew members need not wear coveralls but should continue to wear gloves, masks and face shields," PTI quoted a person familiar with the development as saying.The overall active cases have shown a sustained decline, with Saturday recording the lowest in 274 days, according to the health ministry’s latest data. The number of fresh daily infections has been below 20,000 for 36 consecutive days, prompting the ministry to further ease restrictions on airlines-related guidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/airlines-may-resume-food-on-flights-of-less-than-2-hour-duration-here-s-what-health-ministry-said-101636798252538.html

This is a matter of 'serving hatred' to those people. Is Facebook responsible for someone? How is Facebook fulfilling this responsibility?” he asked.Also read | Congress MP writes to Facebook India head over company’s partisan policiesGupta in his letter urged Zuckerberg to conduct an internal inquiry into the functioning of Facebook India and make the findings public. “It is your responsibility as the head of this organisation to hold those responsible for betraying our people accountable for their actions,” ANI reported, citing an excerpt from the letter.Further, he also shared a list of three “facts” which he claimed had come to the light. “Firstly, according to a report, when Facebook staff points out hatred and fake news content being spread through Facebook in India, the Facebook executives reply that it is not that big an issue, it is not a problem,” he said.“This hatred is hollowing out India's brotherhood and is weakening India. Facebook India seems to not have a problem with it and more importantly, BJP has no problem by weakening India due to hatred,” he added.“The second fact is that when inflammatory content, fake news was being spread on Facebook, the social media giant chose to ignore its own internal reports on the problem. Instead, Facebook India reduced the number of people in its team who controlled such,” he said. He also alleged that the BJP “took advantage” of this situation.“The third fact is shocking. In the Facebook India report, it said that during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, BJP-RSS spread fake information, hatred among people at an alarming level to win elections and Facebook India also allowed it to spread,” he further claimed.“Facebook India is not only escaping from its responsibilities but also highlighting, forming the nexus of spreading lies and hatred. But we will not allow the land of India to be used for spreading lies and hatred,” he added.Gupta letter to Zuckerberg comes after party MP Gaurav Gogoi wrote to Facebook India managing director Ajit Mohan expressing “vehement disdain and alarm pertaining to the recent revelations made by former employees of Facebook Inc. regarding their internal policies and action taken relating to the moderation of content on your platform.”“Considering the pivotal role Facebook plays today in disseminating information and shaping public opinion, such allegations if true are likely to have an adverse public impact,” Gogoi said in his letter.(With ANI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-writes-to-mark-zuckerberg-seeks-internal-inquiry-on-fake-news-findings-be-made-public-101636797659188.html

13-11-2021||India||India strongly takes up 'Khalistan' referendum with UK||Even though India and the UK share similar views on the Indo-Pacific as strategic partners, New Delhi has conveyed its serious concerns to London for allowing banned pro-Khalistan organisation Sikhs for Justice to hold a referendum on the secession of Punjab on October 31.While the so-called referendum held in downtown London turned out to be a damp squib, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval made it clear to his UK counterpart Stephen Lovegrove that the Modi government takes strong exception to the UK allowing a referendum on affairs of a third country by weaponising a minuscule section of the Indian diaspora. The Indian position was conveyed during the bilateral strategic dialogue on November 3 in London.It is understood that India made it clear that there was total peace in Punjab with radical Sikh elements failing to get even one per cent of the vote during assembly or Lok Sabha polls held every five years. The Modi government conveyed its serious concern that the UK government is turning a blind eye to the open radicalisation of the Indian diaspora by Sikh banned groups to promote their secessionist agenda. Under the influence and support of the Pakistani deep state, the Sikh radicals have been holding protests on the three farm laws and punitively participating in anti-India activities in the UK. Despite the SFJ being a banned organization in India since 2019 and its leader Gurpatwant Singh Pannu being declared a terrorist, the UK allowed the US-based extremist organisation to conduct an illegal referendum on the Indian Punjab.Unlike European Union countries like France, Spain and Netherlands with whom India has very close ties, the bilateral ties with the UK have been derailed by London playing an adversarial role against India when it comes to Afghanistan, Pakistan, Kashmir, and the so-called Khalistan issue. In this context, the role played by UK Chief of Defence Staff Nick Carter, who called Taliban terrorist country boys with code of honour, in the now failed Doha peace process stands out singularly.Although India and the United Kingdom have been strategic partners since 2004, the UK role in tacitly supporting Pakistan in the multi-lateral fora on abrogation of Articles 370 and 35 A in Jammu and Kashmir on August 5, 2019, has been noted with concern by the Modi government.It is understood that while UK NSA Lovegrove assured NSA Doval that no anti-India sentiment will be promoted, India is watching London carefully to see whether the promise gets translated on the ground as adversarial actions will directly impact bilateral ties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-strongly-takes-up-khalistan-referendum-with-uk-101636794826859.html

13-11-2021||India||Mumbai achieves 100% first dose Covid vaccine coverage||Nearly ten months after the nationwide Covid-19 vaccination programme was rolled out, Mumbai has achieved 100% first dose coverage on Saturday. The city’s target adult population is 9,236,546, and by noon on Saturday, 9,239,902 first dose has been administered in the city, according to the CoWin dashboard. Mumbai’s second dose coverage stood at 5,983,452, nearly 65% of the city’s adult population. “Decentralising the vaccination centres played a crucial role in our vaccine coverage,” said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. Civic officials said their aim is to achieve coverage beyond 100% as many people from the Mumbai Metropolitan Region have taken the vaccine jabs in Mumbai. Infectious disease expert and member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force Dr Om Srivastava said that 100% first dose coverage is a great news for the city. “It definitely means that the city has lot more protection, but this should not be taken as an excuse to let our guards down. The virus is unpredictable, and there are countries that are seeing large number of cases even now. France, for instance has now announced that they are experiencing the fifth wave,” he said. According to Srivastava, Russia, which has high vaccination coverage is also going through a surge. “It is difficult to predict how the virus will behave in different countries, despite vaccination,” he said. Also Read: HC order on Wankhede defamation suit reservedMumbai launched the first phase of Covid-19 vaccination for healthcare workers on January 16, along with the rest of the country, with just 10 vaccination centres. The city gradually increased the number of vaccinations centres, while battling many instances of supply shortage. Its feat of 100% first dose coverage was achieved by a total of 462 public and private vaccination centres that have the combined capacity to administer over 123,000 vaccine doses a day. “It’s a great milestone and perhaps the first in the country,” said vaccination expert Dr Naveen Thacker, a former civil society organisation representative to GAVI, the vaccine alliance. “Mumbai has shown us that 100% vaccination is achievable. Other districts in the country should follow suit,” he said, adding that the full first dose coverage is a relief at a time when schools and colleges are reopening and all lockdown restrictions have been lifted. “This wide coverage should be a good barrier between the city and the anticipated third wave,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-achieves-100-first-dose-covid-vaccine-coverage-101636791408475.html

13-11-2021||India||On pollution in Delhi, Supreme Court suggests imposing lockdown for 2 days||The Supreme Court on Saturday suggested that the Centre and the Delhi government may consider imposing a lockdown of two days in the national capital in view of the high pollution levels. The court's observations came while hearing a case in this matter.A bench of Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana, Justices DY Chandrachud and Surya Kant said that the air quality in Delhi is in the "severe" category and will dip further in another 2-3 days and asked the Centre to take an emergency decision. "Tell us how we can reduce AQI from 500 at least by 200 points. Take some urgent measures. Can you think of two days lockdown or something? How can people live? We will look at a long term solution later," it said."You have to look at this issue beyond politics and government. Something must happen so that in two to three days we feel better," the bench told the Centre.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, told the bench that the government is going to hold a meeting today where the focus will be on the emergency situation of air pollution.The Centre further said in its response that we have to be watchful till November 18, as per its consultation with the India Meteorological Department (IMD), which has cited a spurt in stubble burning as one of the reasons.The court, however, said that farmers alone can't be blamed for the rising pollution levels over stubble burning and that the authorities must deal with other causes too, including vehicular pollution, dust and industrial pollution.The court then asked the Delhi government about what happened to its decision to install smog towers and emission control projects. "This is not the Centre's but your jurisdiction. What is happening on that front?" the apex court asked the Delhi government. After the court's rap, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has called an emergency meeting today at 5pm.The court then directed Centre to call an emergency meeting of all the stakeholders and posted the matter for hearing on Monday.The air quality level in Delhi plunged to near emergency levels on Friday, with the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recording an AQI of 471.

The MoU was signed in Glasgow amid the ongoing COP26 summit.Maharashtra’s new draft Electric Vehicle (EV) Policy 2021 aims to bring at least 146,000 new battery-operated electric vehicles (BEVs) on state roads by 2025, estimated to comprise about 10% of all new vehicle registrations by that time. The policy aims to incentivise purchase of 100,000 electric two-wheelers, 15,000 e-autos, 10,000 cars, 20,000 goods carriers (both three and four-wheeler) and 1,000 e-buses.For each of these vehicle segments, incentives are likely to be funded by the green tax levied on polluting vehicles, said officials from the transport department. Importantly, urban local bodies will also provide rebates on property tax to residential establishments that set up EV charging infrastructure on their premises. In fact, the policy targets that all upcoming residential complexes should have 20% of their parking spots dedicated for EVs by 2025.Also Read: Maharashtra education dept to refund only 21% of board exam fees“We look forward to further our partnership on electric mobility, ZEV, hydrogen fuel and decarbonisation of our transport and urban renewal sector” said Aaditya Thackeray, Cabinet minister for environment and climate change, at the signing of the MoU.

RMI India is inspired by honourable minister’s vision for 100% electrification of public transport in the state and is looking forward to bringing together RMI and RMI India’s expertise to support the state in decarbonising its transportation sector.” RMI India is currently implementing its City EV Accelerator platform in Pune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-signs-mou-to-boost-adoption-of-electric-vehicles-101636782828357.html
13-11-2021||India||'Arrest her': Who said what on Kangana Ranaut's alms remark||Actor Kangana Ranaut, who is known for making controversial remarks, has again stirred controversy over her views on India's independence struggle against the British Raj.The 34-year-old Padma Shri Award winner said in an interview with a TV news channel that India's independence in 1947 was not freedom but ‘bheek’ (alms) and the country got real independence in 2014 when the Narendra Modi-led government came into power.Also Read| Kangana Ranaut’s alms remark ‘biggest misuse of freedom’, says BJP leader“That wasn’t freedom, it was a bheek (alms). We got real freedom in 2014,” Ranaut said in a 24-second clip which was tweeted by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Varun Gandhi. Gandhi said that it is an anti-national act and must be called out as such.Political parties, including the BJP, have strongly condemned Ranaut's remarks.The Congress on Friday demanded that the Centre should take back the Padma Shri from Ranaut as she insulted the country’s independence movement. The Shiv Sena, which is an ally in the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in Maharashtra, said that a sedition case should be filed against the Bollywood actor.Also Read| Withdraw Padmashri, National Awards given to Kangana: MVAThe Mahila Congress in Rajasthan has already lodged multiple complaints with the police against Ranaut and the TV channel where she gave the interview. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has also filed a complaint against the actor in Nagpur. Here are the top reactions on Kangana Ranaut's comment:• “We strongly condemn actress Kangana Ranaut’s statement. She insulted freedom fighters. The Centre must take back the Padma Shri from Kangana and arrest her. Looks like Kangana Ranaut took a heavy dose of Malana Cream before making such a statement,” Maharashtra minister and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Nawab Malik.• “Being the son of a freedom fighter and coming from a family of freedom fighters, I find Kangana Ranaut’s remarks that India’s freedom was alms (bheek) as the biggest misuse of freedom and an insult to the sacrifice made by freedom fighters,” Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor.• “Prime Minister should break his silence and tell the nation if he endorses the views of Ms Ranaut. If not, the government should take appropriate legal action against such people,” Senior Congress leader Anand Sharma said in a series of tweets.• “Kangana Ranaut’s comment on the country’s fight for Independence is completely wrong. Nobody has a right to pass a negative remark on the freedom movement,” Maharashtra BJP President Chandrakant Patil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arrest-her-who-said-what-on-kangana-ranaut-s-alms-remark-101636778111134.html

13-11-2021||India||Days before PM Modi inaugurates Habibganj station, MP govt seeks to rename it||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate the swanky new Habibganj railway station in Madhya Pradesh's capital Bhopal on Monday (November 15). The station has been redeveloped as a cost of ₹100 crore.Days before the inauguration, the Madhya Pradesh government this week sent a letter to the Union home ministry to rename Habibganj railway station after Rani Kamlapati, the 18th Century Gond queen of the region.Explaining the reason behind the proposal, the Madhya Pradesh government's letter said that the renaming of the station will honour Rani Kamlapati's legacy and bravery.Rani Kamlapati was the widow Gond ruler of Nizam Shah, chief of Ginnorgarh. The Gond community comprises the largest tribal group of India with more than 1.2 crore population. Linguistically, the Gonds belong to the Gondi–Manda subgroup of the South Central branch of the Dravidian language family.The letter from the state's transport department has said that renaming the station is also in accordance with the Indian government's decision to celebrate November 15 as 'Janjatiya Gaurav Diwas' in remembrance of revered tribal leader and freedom fighter Birsa Munda.Starting Monday, the government will organise week-long celebration of the pride of the Scheduled Tribes in India.Madhya Pradesh government's letter comes a day after Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP from Bhopal Pragya Singh Thakur demanded that the station be renamed after former Prime Minister late Atal Bihari Vajpayee.Thakur had been raising the demand since July, requesting the state government to honour the promise she made to voters in her constituency. Apart from Habibganj railway station, Thakur has sought renaming Islampura as Jagdishpura, Idgah as Guru Nanak Tekri, and Obaidullahganj, a town near Bhopal, as Shivpur.Recently, the name of Allahabad railway station in Uttar Pradesh was changed to Prayagraj and Mughalsarai railway junction was renamed as Pt Deen Dayal Upadhyay junction.The Habibganj railway station has been developed under a public-private partnership and developed by the Bansal Group. It has been built at a cost of around ₹450 crore and is on the same lines as Germany's Heidelberg railway station.Around 160 CCTV cameras have been installed at the station to keep round-the-clock surveillance. It also has escalators and lifts to reach the platform.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/days-before-pm-modi-inaugurates-habibganj-station-mp-govt-seeks-to-rename-it-101636767511698.html
13-11-2021||India||Supreme Court to hear today case regarding operation of 126-year-old Mullaperiyar Dam||The Supreme Court will on Saturday hear a public interest litigation regarding the operation of the 126-year-old Mullaperiyar Dam, a longstanding dispute between the states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. In view of a recent spell of heavy downpour in Kerala and the threat of floods looming large, the Supreme Court had in the last hearing issued an interim order saying the water level in the dam can be up to 139.05 feet. The matter was then adjourned at the top court on Monday and scheduled for hearing on November 13.Kerala and Tamil Nadu have been at loggerheads over the century-old dam, with the former insisting the reservoir is not safe and wants a new one in its place while its neighbour has been maintaining it was strong.Notably, the Pinarayi Vijayan-led CPI(M)-LDF government in Kerala had earlier granted Tamil Nadu permission to cut down 15 trees downstream of Baby Dam at the Mullaperiyar reservoir. However, in the wake of intense criticism – mainly from the Opposition Congress over the issue – the state government later froze the order and decided in a cabinet meeting that the earlier November 5 order issued by the principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife) and the chief wildlife warden was “not legally binding”.While Tamil Nadu had sought a nod for the removal of 23 trees, permission was granted for clearing 15, which was also later frozen. The Vijayan government was under attack from the opposition Congress-led bloc in the state Assembly for its controversial order granting permission to cut the trees. It had staged a walkout in the assembly earlier in the day over the issue.The official who prepared the order could also face action, the PTI news agency reported, citing those familiar with the matter. Besides that, the cabinet also decided to set up a three-tier committee to provide the Kerala government with the necessary views and advice to take quick and accurate decisions on issues related to inter-state river water disputes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-to-hear-today-case-regarding-operation-of-126-year-old-mullaperiyar-dam-101636763373656.html

He claimed that Malik’s statements alleging his son forged his caste certificate and other personal documents “caused harm to him and his family”.Wankhede was leading the probe into drugs allegedly found on a cruise on October 3, a case in which actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan spent 26 days in custody.“Verification (of documents) is of some importance. The verification of an MLA has to be of a different level,” the single-judge bench of justice Madhav Jamdar observed before reserving his order.Wankhede is currently facing a NCB vigilance probe on extortion charges. Wankhede’s lawyer Arshad Shaikh told the HC that the documents posted by Malik were not public documents. However, Malik’s advocate Atul Damle said most documents referred to by Malik were either from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation records or from the social media accounts of members of the Wankhede family, and reasonable verification was done before posting them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-order-on-wankhede-defamation-suit-reserved-101636762874259.html

A similar alert has been issued for five other districts for Sunday.While Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Pathanamthitta, Alappuzha, Kottayam and Idukki are expected to witness the downpour on Saturday, the alert on November 14 warns of heavy rainfall in Pathanamthitta, Alappuzha, Kottayam, Ernakulam and Idukki.The alert comes due to northeast monsoon, which has been active in the southern state.In its weather bulletin issued on Friday evening, the IMD has warned of "heavy to very heavy rainfall" at isolated places over Kerala. It will be accompanied by thunderstorm and lightning. According to the IMD bulletin, heavy rainfall will continue to lash Kerala till November 16.Idukki district collector Sheeba George said that the shutters of the Cheruthoni Dam of the Idukki reservoir might be opened on Saturday or Sunday in case the rain continues in the district.George warned the people living downstream the Idukki dam and along the banks of Periyar river to remain cautious.The IMD categories its alerts based on the rainfall activity expected in the region. There are three types of alerts which are issued by the weather department - red, orange and yellow. The red alert is issued when there is an expectation of torrential rains of over 20cm in 24 hours. Orange alert denotes very heavy rains from 6cm to 20cm of rain. A yellow alert, meanwhile, means heavy rainfall between 6 to 11cm.Kerala witnessed heavy rainfall in October, which led to landslides in various parts of the state. Forty two lives were lost in rain-related incidents. The monsoon activity has revived in the state after a brief pause, and after the IMD alert, the fishermen have been advised not to go out in the sea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-to-be-pounded-by-more-rain-today-orange-alert-issued-for-6-districts-101636762448503.html
13-11-2021||India||Amit Shah in UP's Azamgarh today, to lay foundation of state university||Union home minister Amit Shah will be visiting Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav's Lok Sabha constituency of Azamgarh in the poll-bound Uttar Pradesh today, where the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader will be laying the foundation stone for a state university and also address a public meeting in the presence of chief minister Yogi Adityanath. Jainath Singh, who is also the BJP's former Azamgarh district unit president, said earlier this week that preparations for Shah's visit were complete and that the chief minister, too, had made a personal visit to Azamgarh to take stock of the situation ahead of the home minister's visit.After coming to power in Uttar Pradesh in 2017, the BJP government had assured the local people that a university would be set up in Azamgarh, considered to be the stronghold of the SP and home turf of its leader Azam Khan. According to political analyst Kaushal Kishore Mishra, a professor at the department of political science at the Banaras Hindu University (BHU), the people of Azamgarh had been demanding this university since as far back as the mid-70s but this demand remained unfulfilled even though multiple different political parties came to power in UP over the past four decades.However, it is only now that the Yogi Adityanath-led BJP government in Uttar Pradesh decided to fulfill the demand by laying the foundation for the university, which will come up on 52 acres of land acquired for the purpose.After laying the foundation for the university in Azamgarh and addressing a subsequent public meeting, home minister Amit Shah will be travelling to Basti, where he is set to address people at the Shiv Harsh Kisan PG College between 3:40pm and 4:25pm.Meanwhile, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav will leave Azamgarh the same day and travel to Gorakhpur, the home turf of Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, in a move to mobilise support for his side of the camp ahead of the assembly elections earlier this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amit-shah-in-up-s-azamgarh-today-to-lay-foundation-of-state-university-101636760595316.html

13-11-2021||India||After Punjab, Bengal eyes move against BSF order||The tussle between the Trinamool Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party over the Centre’s decision to extend the jurisdiction of the Border Security Force (BSF) in West Bengal from 15km to 50km of the international border with Bangladesh headed towards a flashpoint on Friday when the Mamata Banerjee government decided to follow Punjab and introduce a resolution against it in the legislative assembly even as Union home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla held a meeting on border issues with state bureaucrats in Kolkata.The developments took place hours after three men, of whom two are suspected to be Bangladesh nationals, were killed when some BSF personnel opened fire after they were allegedly attacked in the Sitai area of Cooch Behar district in north Bengal.On October 26, Bengal chief minister had set the tone by declaring that she will not accept the extension of the BSF’s jurisdiction. “This is direct interference with our state’s sovereignty and India’s federal structure. Law and order is a state subject. We have high respect for the BSF but they cannot operate inside our districts. We will oppose this,” she said at the state secretariat. Her party took this forward on Friday.Among Indian states that share borders with neighbouring nations, Bengal’s 2,216.7 km-long border with Bangladesh is the longest and covers 10 of the 23 districts. These are Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri, Cooch Behar, North Dinajpur, South Dinajpur and Malda in north Bengal and Nadia, Murshidabad North 24 Parganas and South 24 Parganas in south Bengal.If the BSF’s jurisdiction is geographically extended then it will cover more than 30 % of Bengal’s territory and include many important towns, TMC leaders pointed out. The ruling party announced that the resolution against the Centre’s decision will be discussed in the assembly on November 16 and protests will be held in the Parliament when the winter session begins.While the TMC spoke against the new law, Bhalla arrived in Kolkata with a MHA team to meet state chief secretary H K Dwivedi, director general of police Manoj Malviya and officers from the bordering districts.“The MHA officers were concerned about security because around half of the border is unfenced. During a two-hour meeting, they discussed ways to ensure better coordination between the BSF and local authorities on infiltration and smuggling,” an officer aware of the details said. Bhalla and Dwivedi refused to talk to the media.The Centre’s recent decision to amend the BSF Act and extend the paramilitary force’s jurisdiction by 35 km from the borders with Pakistan and Bangladesh in Punjab, West Bengal and Assam have already witnessed protests in the first two non-BJP-ruled states. Assam, where the BJP is in power, has kept silent.The Punjab assembly on Thursday passed a resolution against the Centre’s notification even as opposition parties questioned the delay by the Congress government in moving the Supreme Court against the order.“The discussions will be held on November 16. The BSF Act had no provision for such extension of jurisdiction. The amendment is illegal,” said Bengal’s parliamentary affairs minister Partha Chatterjee.The TMC’s leader in the Lok Sabha, Sudip Bandopadhyay, said protests his party is planning may stop parliamentary proceedings. “We will raise our voice in the Lok Sabha. Fifty kilometres is a big zone. Our state will never accept this. If required, we will create a situation that may lead to adjournment of the session,” he said.Bengal Congress president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury supported the TMC. “The state government should pass a resolution in assembly. People in my district do not want the BSF in their backyard.”For the ruling party, more powers to a Central paramilitary force has a political implication, especially in north Bengal where the BJP captured seven of the region’s eight Lok Sabha seats in 2019 and 30 of the 54 assembly constituencies in the March-April state polls. Since June, a section of BJP leaders in north Bengal have been demanding a separate state or Union territory of the region citing lack of development.Questioning the Centre’s decision to extend the area of jurisdiction of the BSF, the CM said, “We do not want this. Our relations with Bhutan, Nepal and Bangladesh are very good. They (BJP government) are doing this to capture more power...”BJP apparatchiks welcomed the amendment, saying Banerjee is opposed to it because infiltrators from Bangladesh comprise her principal vote bank. “The move is a positive step by the Centre to control smuggling, infiltration and trans-border terrorism. It is not surprising that Mamata Banerjee will oppose it because cow smugglers and Rohingyas (read infiltrators) vote for her,” BJP national vice-president Dilip Ghosh said on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-punjab-bengal-eyes-move-against-bsf-order-101636758392523.html
13-11-2021||India||JPC considers relaxations for social media firms in data law||The joint parliamentary committee, led by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP PP Chaudhary, is considering introducing amendments to the country’s first Personal Data Protection Bill to reduce penalties against defaulting social media companies and remove the provision treating them as publishers, people familiar with the matter said.“It seems that big tech has managed to garner support to relax some of the provisions of the data protection law,” a person familiar with the matter said. “Clauses from section 28 that proposed to treat social media companies as publishers in case they altered content have been proposed to be removed. Moreover, clauses that dealt with the civil penalties to be imposed upon the social media companies have been reduced from 4%, which is the bar for EU GDPR,” the person added.The draft Personal Data Protection law was referred to a JPC to iron out several contentious issues in 2019. A previous draft was scheduled to be circulated among the members earlier this year but was abandoned when the then head, Meenakshi Lekhi, was replaced by Chaudhary.The JPC is set to table its report in the winter session.A second person familiar with the matter said that the changes were vociferously contested and a new draft report is likely to be circulated on November 20, two days before panel meets.The report, drafted under the chairpersonship of Lekhi, proposed to treat social media platforms as publishers -- a move that would make them liable for content posted by users, one of the people cited above said. This was of particular concern because the bill cleared by the Centre allowed for the government to claim an exemption as long as it felt it was “necessary or expedient” to do so in a particular set of circumstances, such as those relating to national security.The panel’s report will aim to address “reasonable purposes for data sharing, exemptions for government agencies and sensitive personal data”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jpcconsiders-relaxations-for-social-media-firms-in-data-law-101636751950509.html

If people are not secure, people are not safe, they cannot rise to the potential and probably the country will never grow,” he added.NSA Doval also pointed to the circumstances in which the young officers will be serving. “It will be a different India at that time. India is on the march and you will see that you will be leading these police forces at a time when it will bring India which has got a new place in the international arena.”India will Doval added, as it progresses towards its 100th year of independence (in 2047)  enter a new era, be known for its “many achievements and many accomplishments”, and be one of the leading nations across the world.Doval also spoke of the importance of laws and of the officers in the context of the laws.The quintessence of democracy does not lie in the ballot box but in the laws which are made by the people who are elected, he said.And the officers” are the ones who are the enforcers of those laws. Laws are not as good as they are made. Laws are as good as they are executed and implemented”.“The implementation of those laws are important. No nation can be built where rule of law has failed. People cannot feel safe and secure where law enforcers are weak, corrupt, partisan,” the NSA added.Doval also said that police forces have a greater role in border management besides maintaining law and order. He said maintaining law and order in every part of the 32 lakh sq km of India is also the responsibility of police forces.“…Not only policing, in which you have been trained very well, but you will (also) be responsible for border management of this country. There’s 15,000 km of the border, and most of it has got peculiar problems of its own,” he added.“There is a border with Pakistan with China or Myanmar or Bangladesh. We have got different types of security-related issues which are manned by the police and the central police organisations which are manning these borders.”The Hyderabad-based Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy trains officers of the Indian Police Service, selected through the Civil Services Examination conducted by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/civil-society-s-division-will-hurt-nation-doval-101636751160424.html
13-11-2021||India||Take punitive action against officials for inaction on hate speech: Plea in SC||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday posted for November 22 a petition filed by former Planning Commission member Syeda Hameed and academic Alok Rai that sought directions to authorities to curb hate speech failing which punitive steps should be taken against them for inaction.The bench of justices AM Khanwilkar and CT Ravikumar told the petitioners to serve a copy of their plea on the centre and decided to hear the case on Friday along with another petition filed by Ashwini Upadhyay.The petition filed by Syeda Hameed and Rai said they were concerned over concerted events in the recent past that targeted political, social and economic exclusion of Muslims through a series of rallies and hate speeches. The petition, filed by lawyer Shahrukh Alam said, their plea was not adversorial and sought implementation of guidelines on hate speech passed by Supreme Court in 2014 and on mob violence and lynching events in a subsequent decision in 2018. The latter decision even prescribed punitive steps against public authorities who failed to contain such incidents.Referring to an August 8 event at Jantar Mantar where anti-Muslim slogans were raised at an event organised to end colonial-era laws, the petition said, “The petitioners are personally affected by the stigmatising and the push towards social and political exclusion that is the result of a concerted and organized series of events aimed at targeting Muslims and their sympathisers.”It said that the constitutional guarantee from protection from ‘hate speech’ is not supposed to protect people from being offended but to protect the dignity of an individual or group. “In recent months, there have been rallies replete with speeches that directly and hatefully target a religious community, use pejoratives to describe them, identify them falsely as predators of land, resources and of Hindu women and advocate their social, economic and political boycott,” the petition said, adding, “In some cases, speeches have advocated direct violence as the final solution.”Pointing to the Jantar Mantar event, which was organized without permission and in violation of Covid-19 protocols, the two petitioners stated, “There is a close proximity of such events that are made in communally charged atmospheres, to incidents of ‘hate crimes’ that range from lynching, and threats of sexual violence to more structural discrimination….The latest episode of 8 August was only one amongst a series of such events.”Incidentally, one of the persons named in the Jantar Mantar case was advocate Ashwini Upadhyay who filed the second petition on framing a law on ‘hate speech’ and ‘rumour mongering’ that came up for hearing before the same bench on Friday.Upadhyay was told to serve his petition on the Centre as well.Upadhyay, also a former Bharatiya Janata Party spokesperson, has claimed that he was framed.in his petition, Upadhyay said the Indian Penal Code was not sufficient to deal with the situations of hate speeches and rumour mongering and sought special provisions in this regard.“Anonymity of internet allows a miscreant to easily spread false and offensive ideas,” Upadhyay said, adding, “Incitement to violence should not be the sole test for determining whether a speech amounts to hate speech or not. Even speech that does not incite violence has the potential of marginalising a certain section of society or individuals.”Both petitions relied on a 2020 Supreme Court decision in Amish Devgun case where hate speech was linked to the violation of unity and fraternity and breach of human dignity, which constitutes an essential facet of the right to life and liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution.In addition, the petition by Syeda Hameed and Rai said, “Hate speech is a discursive process of pushing marginalised groups outside of social, economic and political spheres of society by disseminating hate propaganda and encouraging discrimination. At its most harmful, it is widely recognized as a precursor to ethnic cleansing.”They highlighted isolated events in the Capital and other places involving violence against a particular minority community in breach of top court’s earlier guidelines.“Public authorities must be held accountable for dereliction of the duty of care and also for non-compliance with this court’s orders by not taking action to prevent vigilante groups from inciting communal disharmony and spreading hate against citizens of the country and taking the laws into their own hands,” added the petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/take-punitive-action-against-officials-for-inaction-on-hate-speech-plea-in-sc-101636747427836.html
13-11-2021||India||Rahul remarks on Hindutva spark fresh political slugfest||The controversy over statements on Hindutva ideology in a new book by former Union minister Salman Khurshid escalated on Friday, when Congress leader Rahul Gandhi called for the need to differentiate between Hindutva and Hinduism, saying the former encouraged violence and the latter preached peace and harmony.While addressing the party’s National Orientation Camp in Wardha on video, Gandhi said: “BJP talks about Hindutva, and we say there is a difference between Hinduism and Hindutva, because if there was no difference, the name would have been the same. Hindutva does not need a Hindu or Hindu does not need Hindutva.”He added that Hinduism did not talk about attacking people from other religions.“Is Hinduism about beating a Sikh or a Muslim? Hindutva of course is. But is Hinduism about killing Akhlaq?” he asked.He went on to question the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh about what kind of Hindu religion they are promoting.The comments -- a day after references in Khurshid’s book, Sunrise over Ayodhya: Nationhood in Our Times, comparing Hindutva to Boko Haram and the Islamic State stirred a political controversy -- sparked angry reactions from the BJP.On Friday, the BJP spokesperson, Sambit Patra, said Gandhi’s comments highlighted his and the Congress’s “pathological hatred for Hinduism”.“It is at the behest of the Gandhi family, particularly Rahul Gandhi, that the other leaders of the Congress party, be it Salman Khurshid, Digvijaya Singh, Rashid Alvi, Mani Shankar Aiyar, among others, often speak against Hinduism. This pathological hatred for Hinduism among the Congress leaders gets its traction, energy from Rahul Gandhi and the Gandhi family,” he added.“Can they talk on similar lines about any other religion? ... This is not the first time such comments have been made. Some of the worst comments have been made in the yesteryears when they have used words such as ‘saffron terror’,” he added.The term “saffron terror’ was also raised by BJP leader and IT cell chief Amit Malviya, who called it a fictitious creation to get Muslim votes through appeasement politics. Patra said that senior Congress leader P Chidambaram used the term ‘saffron terror’ in 2010 and since then it has been used by his party colleagues.Union minister RK Singh, meanwhile, lashed out at Khurshid over his recent statement where he compared ‘Hindutva’ with ‘Jihadi’ organisations., “Isn’t he (Khurshid) the man who bad-mouthed India in Pakistan’s military academy? Isn’t he the man who embezzled funds for the handicapped? It’s a matter of shame and intolerance to denigrate a whole religion. What’s Congress doing?” he said in an interview with ANI.The Congress, however, quickly distanced itself from Khurshid’s comment.Amidst this Hindutva row, a video of Congress leader Rashid Alvi purportedly saying that ‘not all people who chant Jai Shri Ram are saints’ has gone viral.BJP’s Amit Malviya shared the video of the senior Congress leader addressing a gathering and tweeted, “After Salman Khurshid, now Congress leader Rashid Alvi is saying those who chant Jai Shri Ram are demons. How much poison does Congress have towards the devotees of Ram!”On Friday, Gandhi said that the BJP and RSS’s “hateful and divisive” ideology has overshadowed the “loving, affectionate and nationalistic” ideology of Congress, and stressed on the importance of spreading the Congress ideology||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-remarks-on-hindutva-spark-fresh-political-slugfest-101636746924549.html

The superintendent of police (SP) has been told to file a report within three days.Since October when the charred remains of Mamita Meher, a school teacher in a private school in Mahalinga panchayat of Kalahandi was found in an under-construction stadium, opposition BJP and Congress have taken to streets alleging that a sex racket flourished there patronised by Gobind Sahu, the president of the school’s managing committee.Sahu is accused of strangling 26-year-old Meher, a teacher in the school, in his car somewhere in Kalahandi district on October 8 after the latter allegedly threatened to expose her extramarital affairs. He then allegedly dismembered the body, burnt it and buried it in the under-construction stadium. He was arrested on October 19 and is in judicial custody.Opposition parties have alleged that a sex racket was being operated in the school’s hostel for girls, and the students and female staffers were sexually harassed by Sahu.In its letter to Kalahandi SP Vivek Saravana, NCPCR such allegations of sexual exploitation of the children. “The accused used to tempt the girls for good marks in examination and minister of state home Dibyashankar Mishra used to visit the school frequently. Both girls, as well as boys of the educational institution, were exploited,” the NCPCPR said.The police officer has been told to send the information on action taken against the accused, and the other details of the schools including the number of students, age group of boys and girls who were allegedly exploited in the school and whether a case was registered in accordance with Section 19/21 of Pocso Act. It however advised the SP to be careful to ensure that the identities of the victims are not disclosed during the process of investigation.Though BJD has stridently defended minister of state Mishra saying he could not be held accountable for the crimes allegedly committed by Sahu, opposition BJP and Congress continued to wave black flags and throw eggs at ministers. BJP and Congress workers pelted eggs at Mishra, agriculture minister Arun Sahu and women and child development minister Tukuni Sahu’s vehicles over last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ncpcrsteps-in-asks-odisha-sp-to-probe-sexual-exploitation-charge-in-kalahandi-school-101636745925372.html
13-11-2021||India||CAG report on flood management flaws kicks off a debate in Kerala||A political slugfest has begun in Kerala over a Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report pointing out serious flaws in the state government’s preparedness and dam management during the 2018 floods that claimed 480 lives across the state. The CAG report titled ‘Preparedness and response to floods in Kerala’ was tabled in the assembly on Thursday. The Opposition heavily criticized the Communist Party of India (Marxist), which was in power during the time of the floods, for its mismanagement and sought a high-level probe into the findings of the audit body. The Congress-led opposition on Friday sought an independent probe into CAG findings saying the government, which is bound to protect the lives and property of its people, endangered their lives due to its inept handling of the situation. Talking to newsmen in the state capital on Friday, opposition leader V D Satheesan said it was a grave error on the part of the CPI (M) government and responsibility should be fixed on people who led to the grave situation. “The CAG has pointed out serious errors in flood management policies. The government even failed to constitute a probe after the death of many people. Even after the tragedy, the government’s track records show it is least bothered,” he said, adding that the state’s floods plains have not been demarcated and flood zoning legislation was not done. The CAG found serious flaws in the state’s management, including lack of real-time data on rainfall, streamflow, the water level in important dams and a poor communication network. “Communication infrastructure was non-functional in some areas including dam sites and government offices during or after the 2018 floods,” it said, adding the Kerala Water Policy 2008 was not updated following the National Water Policy. Though 7000-odd works for immediate repair and restoration of damages in 2018 floods were approved for execution under the state disaster response fund, only 18 per cent of the work were yet to be completed even after three years, the report said. The responsible authorities failed to issue mandatory alerts or warnings when the rain situation deteriorated in 2018, it said in the latest report, saying most flaws were yet to be addressed. The report also said no flood hazard map was available in the state and its flood susceptibility map was not in conformation with the Central Water Commission criteria. Siltation studies also found significant levels of siltation in many dams, and works were very slow. The report assumes much significance as the state has been consistently reporting flash floods and landslides in the last three years. After the 2018 floods, there was widespread criticism over the way all dams were opened simultaneously and many, including ‘Metro Man’ E Sreedharan, had approached the Kerala high court seeking a probe into the so-called lapses on the part of government bodies. Moreover, in 2018, there was a charge against then power minister M M Mani for delaying the opening of the Idukki dam in an alleged attempt to produce more power. The delay triggered a chain reaction, which caused further flooding across the downstream. Idukki hydroelectric project produces one-fourth of power in the state. On Friday, Mani denied most of the findings in the report and suspected a political angle in the report. “In 2018, the state received the highest rainfall of the century. Some areas in Idukki received more than 300 mm of rainfall in just two days. There is no mention of heavy rainfall in the report. It is easy to blame without understanding the ground situation,” he said, adding the government averted dam bursts due to its effective handling. “In the light of changing rain pattern and threats of climate change we need experts’ team for every day dam to monitor the situation. We need a real-time decision. And we have to expedite dam and river-basin related works and repairs on a war footing,” said dam expert James Wilson, also a former member of the Mullaperiyar dam cell.

13-11-2021||India||Andhra govt, local bodies owe over ₹25,000 cr dues to discoms||The Andhra Pradesh government and the local bodies in the state together owe ₹25,257 crore to power distribution companies towards tariff subsidy and electricity consumption charges.This was revealed in a letter written by the Andhra Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (APERC) to the state government and three power distribution companies – Eastern Discom, Central Discom and Southern Discom – on November 9, a copy of which was seen by HT.APERC said while the state government had not released the subsidy on power tariff to the extent of ₹15,474.43 crore to the three Discoms, the local bodies and various government departments have not been paying power bills amounting to ₹9,783.37 crore to the Discoms over a period of time. The letter does not specify the period.The total amount of dues to be recovered by the three Discoms from the government and the local bodies has shot up to ₹25,257.70 crore, it said.“The situation looks alarming, to say the least, and the very survival of the Discoms is at stake. If not addressed, it will also adversely impact the consumers in the state,” the commission said in the letter.The commission found fault with the Discoms for not collecting the dues. “It is regretted to note that the Discoms have not realised the seriousness of the situation and are not making their best efforts to collect the dues, in spite of the proactive steps taken by the commission to support them and bail them out of the financial crisis,” the letter said.The commission directed that the Discoms serve fresh notices to the local bodies and the government departments offering them the last chance to clear the pending dues within 14 days failing which power supply be disconnected.“Further, the Discoms are also directed to pursue with the state government to release the pending tariff subsidy amounts on a war-footing. The Discoms have been asked to submit the compliance reports to the commission on the above directions within 15 days,” the letter said.Energy department secretary Nagulapalli Srikanth could not be reached for his comment on the regulatory commission’s letter. Calls and text messages to the secretary went unanswered.Telugu Desam Party lawmaker and Public Accounts Committee chairman Payyavula Keshav alleged that the Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy government was pushing the Discoms into a state of bankruptcy.“As per the APERC guidelines, the state government has to pay the power tariff subsidy to the Discoms in advance before the tariff order is approved every year. But it never happens. These dues could be pending since the days of the previous TDP regime, but it is the responsibility of the government to clear the dues periodically,” Keshav said.With the state government failing to pay the tariff subsidy to Discoms on time and not clearing the power consumption charges of its departments for long, the Discoms are forced to go in for borrowings from financial institutions for purchasing power.“The interest burden on these loans is being recovered from the consumers in the form of True-Up charges. So, the ultimate sufferers are common people,” the TDP leader said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-govt-local-bodies-owe-over-25-000-cr-dues-to-discoms-101636743105177.html

According to a circular issued by the railway board, it has rolled back all the regular mail timetables which are currently operating as mail/express special trains. The Railways have also decided to revert to some of the original fares as applicable.According to a circular released by the Railway Board late on Friday evening, regular fares will be charged for concerned classes of travel and type of train, as per the guidelines issued.The circular read, “Second class of such trains shall continue to run as reserved except any relaxation permitted in special case.”“The passengers travelling on these trains are required to pay 30% extra fares. With Covid-19 cases being under control, the ministry in Friday’s meeting decided to resume trains as per pre-Covid trains,” a railway official said.Around 1700 mail express trains were running before Covid-19 hit the country and they had to be halted due to the pandemic.The Indian Railways had been operating special trains with full reservation across the country ever since the Covid-19 pandemic affected the nation. Passengers travelling in these special trains pay extra fares as compared to normal trains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/railways-to-discontinue-special-trains-revert-to-certain-pre-covid-19-fares-101636742685261.html
13-11-2021||India||Major rejig likely in Raj cabinet, Pilot holds meeting with Sonia||A major reshuffle encompassing both ministerial and other political appointments might take place in the Rajasthan government to balance regional sentiments and caste combinations, and get rid of some non-performing ministers, with the larger aim of managing the turf war between chief minister Ashok Gehlot and his former deputy Sachin Pilot.Two insiders with knowledge of developments don’t rule out the possibility of Pilot getting some responsibilities, too, if the proposed reshuffle goes according to plan.The former deputy CM of Rajasthan, who rebelled against Gehlot in July 2020, met Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Friday for over an hour. “It is essential to form our government in Rajasthan again in 2023. The party’s decision would be taken keeping the factors such as experience, credibility, regional balance and caste combination in mind,” Pilot said outside 10 Janpath, Gandhi’s residence.“There’s not much time left (for poll preparations). There are some vacancies to be filled and there are some balancing to be done,” he added. The reshuffle is likely to take place this month, based on a formula acceptable to both Gehlot and Pilot, said people aware of developments. Two more meetings are likely to finalise names.Gehlot had met Sonia Gandhi on Thursday, and party general secretaries Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Ajay Maken and KC Venugopal a day before.The Gehlot cabinet currently has nine vacancies and three ministers—state Congress unit chief Govind Singh Dotasara, and the party’s Gujarat and Punjab in-charges Raghu Sharma and Harish Chaudhary, respectively—hold two posts each. Some of them might be relieved from ministerial assignments, said party leaders with knowledge of developments.The Pilot camp is also hopeful that a few “non-performing ministers” might also be dropped, said the leaders quoted above.“In the meeting, Pilot also pointed out that while Punjab has got its first Dalit CM, Rajasthan doesn’t even have a Dalit minister even as it got overwhelming support from SC/ ST [scheduled caste and scheduled tribe] and minorities in the last assembly polls.”According to a senior party leader involved in Rajasthan matters, there are at least six districts that are not represented in the Union cabinet and the next reshuffle might address the regional imbalance. The Pilot camp is hopeful that their leader gets a bigger responsibility after elections in five states are done early next year.Pilot loyalists are hopeful that out of the vacancies arising in the Rajasthan government, at least 50% posts will go to them but Gehlot too, has a strong rapport with the high command and his administrative and political experience may benefit him.“Whatever happens in Rajasthan, it would not be a one-sided decision. Sonia Gandhi has met both Gehlot and Pilot. All reshuffle should be acceptable to Gehlot as well...,” said the senior leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/major-rejig-likely-in-raj-cabinet-pilot-holds-meeting-with-sonia-101636742211382.html
13-11-2021||India||Maoist ‘Kishan Da’ caught after decades on run||Raipur/Kolkata/New Delhi: The Jharkhand Police on Friday held Prashant Bose, better known by his nom de guerre “Kishan Da”, from the Kandra area of Saraikela Kharsawan district -- possibly the most prominent alleged Maoist leader to be captured alive in the country in at least two decades.Bose is over 80 years old, carries a bounty of ₹1 crore, is part of the National Investigation Agency’s most wanted list, and has been an ideological fountainhead of the guerilla Maoist movement for over five decades. His wife, Sheela Marandi, was held along with him, according to reports citing the state police. Marandi is also a senior member of the Maoist cadre; the only woman in the Central Committee, the foremost operational organization of the Maoists; and spent over a decade in jail in multiple cases in Odisha and Jharkhand before she was released from a Rourkela prison in 2016. Senior officials from multiple agencies, including the Jharkhand Police, the Chhattisgarh Police, and intelligence agencies confirmed that Bose and his wife were held. “Top Maoist leader Prashant Bose, alias Kishan Da, who was carrying a bounty of ₹1 crore on his head, has been arrested in Jharkhand along with his wife Sheela Marandi, a senior police officer said on Friday. According to the officer, the police, acting on intelligence inputs, arrested the duo,” PTI reported. HT could not independently verify if they were arrested or just detained.Another senior police officer said that they were going to interrogate Bose, who has grown frail and weak, as well as his wife Marandi, who is the “top woman Maoist [in the organisation] in her own right and leads many women oriented frontal organisations for the Maoists.” “He has suffered many illnesses and cannot travel on his own. His associates were trying to take him to a safe place, but they were intercepted midway,” the Jharkhand Police officer added, asking not to be named. Governments at the state and the centre have for long grappled with Maoism, with former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh describing Maoism in 2006 as “the single biggest internal security threat ever faced by our country.” In 2018, the Home Ministry said that as many as twelve thousand people had lost their lives in the Maoist conflict “in the last two decades”, including 2700 security personnel. Data from the South Asia Terrorism Portal estimates that ten thousand people have been killed since the year 2000.Bose also goes by the names Nirbhay, Kajal, Buddha or Maneesh. For four decades until a change in the Maoist leadership in 2018 -- when Nambala Keshava Rao (Basavaraju) took over from Muppala Lakshman Rao (Ganapathy) as General Secretary of the banned CPI (Maoist) -- Bose was largely considered the second most senior Maoist in the country. “When Basavaraju took over from Ganapathy, the idea was to make the leadership a little younger. So both Ganapathy and Prashant Bose took a back seat, but they are clearly the two biggest Maoists India has seen of the past three decades,” a senior intelligence officer told HT on Friday on condition of anonymity. NIA records describe Bose as five-foot-six, say that he “keeps a light beard to hide a twisted left cheek”, has “false teeth”, is “fond of tobacco”, and wears “bifocal specs”. The investigative agency also shows Bose as a member of the CPI (Maoist) politburo, its highest political body, a member of the Central Committee, a non-permanent member of the CMC ( Central Military Commission), and secretary of the Eastern Regional Bureau, which oversees all Maoist activities in seven states including Jharkhand and West Bengal. “[He] reportedly stays in the Saranda forests (Jharkhand). Can be regarded as the No. 2 man in the CPI(Maoist),” the NIA records, which HT has seen, show. Bose was also one of the two principal architects of the unification of the two primary Maoist organisations in the country in 2004, creating the CPI (Maoist), as it is known today. While Bose was the supreme commander of the Maoist Communist Centre of India, which operated principally in Jharkhand, West Bengal and Bihar, Ganapathy led the Peoples War Group, the strongest in Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. According to intelligence officers, the two groups came together on September 21, 2004; and at the meeting, known as the “unity conference”, Bose told cadres: “We are intensifying the war by forming several guerrilla zones, advancing towards the establishment of Base Areas, and transforming the guerrilla army into a regular liberation army. It is in this background that the joint meeting is going on with the objective of unifying into a single directing centre for the Indian revolution.” Such was Bose’s heft among the Maoist cadre that his alias, Kishen, was adopted by Mallujola Koteshwar Rao -- who came to be known as Kishenji and became one of India’s most well-known Maoist leaders. Rao was killed in 2011. Unlike “Kishenji” however, “Kishan da”, was much less of a public figure, almost a ghost for security agencies who have been on the hunt for him most of his life. Chhattisgarh police officers said that security agencies have all of two photographs of him. The first, a grainy visual is likely from the 1980s, and is the one pasted on most records. “Then, in 2012, after a raid in Dantewada district of Chhattisgarh, we found a CD which had a clearer photograph of him,” a senior intelligence official said. Former Maoist Amitadyuti Kumar, 77, who lives in Kolkata, and once worked with Bose but has not met him since 1975, told HT: “I still remember how he escaped the police in Hooghly district in 1970. We were holding a secret meeting when the police and CRPF raided the area. Local villagers decided to hide Bose in a raft made out of water hyacinths and floated it in the river. He stayed there all night.” In 2011, Delhi Police said in a charge sheet that it was Bose who signed a deal with the Manipur-based militant group, the People’s Liberation Army, seeking to train Maoist cadre in guerilla warfare. At the time, the special cell claimed they found emails exchanged between the PLA and Bose which planned joint training exercises and training camps for Maoists in Myanmar. Bose was named as an accused in November 2018 by the Maharashtra Police in the controversial Bhima-Koregaon violence case, which has seen the arrests of multiple activists and lawyers including Surendra Gadling, Rona Wilson and Sudha Bhardwaj for allegedly conspiring with the Maoists. Ajay Sahni, executive director of Institute of Conflict Management said, “People like Kishan Da have been on the run for a long time even though they were able to supervise occasional attacks. There will definitely be some sort of psychological impact (on the organisation) but I don’t think it will extraordinarily change the situation on the ground as the capability (of Maoists) is already hit. They are fighting a last-ditch battle. When the movement itself is fading, supervision is not that important.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maoist-kishan-da-caught-after-decades-on-run-101636740464501.html
13-11-2021||India||PM Modi to address 200k tribals as part of BJP outreach plan||Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to address 200,000 tribals from Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Jharkhand and West Bengal at an event in Bhopal as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) attempts to reach out to the community, people familiar with the matter said.The PM is set to inaugurate the Janjatiya Gaurav Diwas on November 15, the birth anniversary of Birsa Munda in Bhopal, which is expected to be a big boost to Bharatiya Janata Party’s tribal outreach plans. The day will be celebrated as ‘Tribal Day’.A senior MP BJP leader aware of the BJP’s strategies to attract the tribals support said the PM’s visit will further cement the new strategy, which has worked in the state and can be replicated in other tribal-dominated states.In the October 30 by-polls, Sulochana Rawat won the Jobat Vidhan Sabha seat for the BJP by 6,104 votes, while Gyaneshwar Patil secured the Khandwa Lok Sabha seat with a margin of more than 88,000 votes.According to a BJP leader, who didn’t wish to be named, the first change in strategy came when the central government declared a holiday on the birth anniversary of Birsa Munda in 2019. “The BJP left no stone unturned to make tribals realise that their ancestors fought for the freedom of country and they were full of patriotism,” he said.Tribal experts, however, said the plan is to win the trust of tribals and divert the community from real issues. Biswas said, “BJP is trying to influence tribal through unsung heroes and push their agenda through these icons. Shankar Shah was a follower of Maa Kali and he is being promoted to show tribal are also Hindus.”Another tribal activist, Vikram Achaliya said, “Definitely, they have shifted the focus but issues remain. The BJP wants to distract tribals from core issues such as poor implementation of the Forest Rights Act and government not accepting Sarna Code (a separate religious code in the Census).”Political experts said tribals are important for any political party in MP as they constitute 21% of the state’s population and have 47 assembly seats reserved for them. Tribals can influence the result in another 31 seats, said political expert Girja Shankar. MP Congress Committee president Kamal Nath said, “BJP leaders are not concerned about the rise in atrocities against the tribal, death of tribal children due to malnourishment and no jobs for them,” he said.Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said on Friday that Congress never thought of tribal development and used them as a vote bank.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pmmodito-address-200k-tribals-as-part-of-bjp-outreach-plan-101636740405359.html
13-11-2021||India||Checks on paper, Delhi chokes on toxic haze||Air pollution reached the season’s worst levels on Friday as the toxic smog that has persisted for over a week thickened and emissions breached “emergency” level thresholds that would have normally led to a host of curbs like a ban on construction work, the entry of heavy vehicles, and odd-even car use limits.Instead, this year has seen a new record for farm fires this late in the year as the enforcement of a ban on the practice collapsed, and has exposed the futility of the mainstay pollution response mechanism known as the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) despite advance predictions that meteorological factors will exacerbate the problem.The air quality index (AQI) was 471, according to the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) 4pm bulletin, having risen by 100 points within 48 hours. The number surpassed the 462 recorded the day after Diwali, when a double whammy of firecracker smoke and farm fires pushed up pollution levels.Doctors urged people to stay indoors, and parents have begun keeping their children at home as the days remain particularly dangerous for those with respiratory conditions.Like each year for nearly a decade now, man-made factors have combined with pre-winter weather conditions to create the perfect storm of conditions that has led to the crisis. “This spike in pollution is an amalgamation of many things. Delhi already saw peak pollution levels after Diwali and the high stubble count in Punjab and Haryana. Because of slow winds, the pollution load is not being eased, and more pollution is being added. All this is being recirculated in the air,” said VK Soni, head of IMD’s environment and research department.Data from heat-sensing satellites analysed by HT show that, this year, there have been 24,694 incidents of fire recorded since November 8. This number is the highest for the second week of November since 2012, the earliest year for which data was available. The later farm fires take place, the harder it is for the smoke to be dispersed in the atmosphere since this is the time of the year when weak pre-winter winds set in over the region.Officials in Punjab, where most of the farm fires take place, told HT earlier they are not prosecuting farmers for violating a Supreme Court-ordered ban on burning crop residue.Authorities have also dragged their feet on factors they can control within the National Capital Region, largely as a consequence of how Grap is designed – the curbs designed for most impact do not kick in unless pollution has remained in the emergency level for 48 hours.The subcommittee of the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM), a new body that now is responsible for the implementation of Grap, met on Friday and reiterated that the measures listed under the severe category will be implemented. They advised government and private offices to reduce the use of private vehicles by at least 30% by encouraging practices such as work-from-home and carpooling, and urged residents to limit outdoor activities.“We have also asked the state pollution control boards of Delhi and NCR to closely monitor the action being taken by enforcement teams and submit reviews to the CAQM and CPCB,” said Prashant Gargava, chairperson of CAQM subcommittee for the implementation of Grap and member secretary, CPCB.The most strict curbs under Grap are a ban on the entry of trucks, shutting down of schools, halting all construction work, and allowing cars with odd and even number plates to be driven only on alternate days. But these come into force only if the PM10 levels and PM2.5 levels have remained above emergency levels for 48 hours. Till 10pm on Friday, PM2.5 levels were above the 300ug/m3 mark (the emergency threshold) for 22 hours and PM10 levels were above 500ug/m3 mark for 20 hours.Experts said the recurring crisis is evidence that the plan to fight air pollution simply does not work. “Grap has been in place since 2017, but we have not seen any impact of from implementing the measures listed under it. So, if these measures have not worked, it means that it has not been effective and we need to look at alternatives. It’s not just Grap, our governments need to revisit their overall approach to pollution management,” said environment issues lawyer Rahul Choudhary.The Supreme Court is likely to discuss the issue on Saturday when it will continue hearing a plea filed by a 17-year-old Delhi student, Aditya Dubey, who has alleged that authorities have failed to protect his fundamental right to clean air and health by not controlling air pollution.A bench, comprising Chief Justice of India NV Ramana and justices DY Chandrachud and Surya Kant, will take up the latest affidavit filed by the Union government on steps taken to reduce air pollution due to various factors, including crop residue burning.As the crisis persists, doctors warn the air outside can leave immediate as well as lasting health impacts, particularly for people’s lungs, heart and even brain. “When we say PM 2.5 or PM 10, it’s just the particle size that we are talking -- the kind of damage depends on what creates the particle such as firecrackers, fuel combustion, stubble burning etc. The particulate matter from diesel or kerosene burning can even cause lung cancer...,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of pulmonology department, AIIMS, Delhi.“What nobody talks much about and does the maximum damage is ultrafine particles of 0.1 micron or less. These penetrate the lung and reach the blood stream, and once in the blood, these can reach anywhere. Even perfectly healthy people can experience short-term symptoms such as breathing issues, sore throat or red eyes,” added Dr Khilnani,For now, experts warned the problem is going to persist, which means the Grap’s 48-hour requirement will be met.“As per IITM’s Decision Support System for air quality management, a significant share of pollution comes from transport-related emissions, in addition to farm fires. The Delhi government should focus on offsetting the additional load from farm fires... by imposing vehicle restrictions, ensuring that open burning of waste is prevented and inspection of all construction sites in Delhi-NCR,” said Tanushree Ganguly, programme lead, Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW).(With inputs from Abhishek Jha)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/checks-on-paper-city-chokes-on-toxic-haze-101636740344449.html
13-11-2021||India||Putin to visit India, S-400 may be in tow||Russian President Vladimir Putin’s visit to India next month for an annual summit is expected to coincide with the delivery of the first batch of S-400 air defence systems and will set the stage for the two sides renewing their military-technical cooperation for the next decade.Putin’s visit will be preceded by the inaugural 2+2 dialogue of the defence and foreign ministers of India and Russia in Moscow. The dialogue, which has been held up by the busy schedules of ministers on both sides, will prepare the grounds for the summit, people familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity.The first batch of S-400 systems is expected to be delivered by December, the people said. Putin is expected to be in New Delhi in the second week of December for the annual summit with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, with both sides looking at December 6 as the most likely date, the people added.At the upcoming summit, India and Russia are expected to renew their military-technical cooperation arrangement for 2021-31 and sign several agreements in defence, trade and science and technology. One of the key agreements expected to be inked is the Reciprocal Exchange of Logistics Agreement (RELOS), which will allow militaries of the two sides to access logistics and support facilities at each other’s bases and ports.India has signalled its commitment to long-standing defence ties with Russia by forging ahead with the $5.4-billion contract for five S-400 systems despite the US warning that the deal could attract secondary sanctions under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).Several teams of Indian Air Force personnel have been trained in Russia to operate the S-400. India and Russia signed the deal in October 2018, and all deliveries are to be completed within five years.The IAF will induct the first unit of S-400 systems at a time when India is locked in a standoff with China in the Ladakh sector, and the Chinese side has deployed two S-400 squadrons at Hotan airbase in Xinjiang and Nyingchi airbase in Tibet, across Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh respectively.The induction of the S-400 systems will enhance IAF’s air defence capabilities, said Air Marshal (retired) Anil Chopra, director general of the Centre for Air Power Studies. “The mix of radars and missiles that will come with the S-400 will cover various height and range bands. It will bring an important capability upgrade with an air defence bubble of 400 km. Of the five systems ordered, four are likely to be deployed in forward areas to defend against aerial threats from China and Pakistan. One system could be used to defend vital industrial facilities,” Chopra said.IAF chief Air Chief Marshal Vivek Ram Chaudhari also said in October his force is likely to induct the first unit of S-400 systems by the year-end.The induction is taking place when India is looking at the creation of theatre commands to best utilise the military’s resources. The current theaterisation model seeks to set up four new integrated commands for synergy in operations – two land-centric theatres, an air defence command, and a maritime theatre command.The India-Russia summit couldn’t be held in 2020 because of the Covid-19 pandemic. This will only be Putin’s second foreign visit since the Covid-19 outbreak began – he travelled to Geneva in June for his first meeting with US President Joe Biden but skipped the G20 Summit in Rome last month. Putin’s upcoming visit to New Delhi reflects the importance attached by Russia to its relationship with India, the people said.Developments in Afghanistan following the Taliban takeover are also expected to figure in both the 2+2 dialogue and the summit. During a phone conversation on August 24, Modi and Putin agreed to create a permanent channel between national security adviser Ajit Doval and his Russian counterpart Nikolay Patrushev for consultations on Afghanistan. Both sides have not recognised the Taliban setup in Kabul and backed calls for the formation of an inclusive government in Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/putin-to-visit-india-s-400-may-be-in-tow-101636740345081.html
13-11-2021||India||Chennai picks up pieces, IMD warns of more rain||The skies were clear in Chennai but the spoils of the mayhem caused by heavy rainfall over the past week were visible on the streets as workers from various government departments fanned out to drain out water, remove fallen trees, clear blocked roads, and help restore normalcy.This relief, however, may be short-lived as another low pressure is likely to form in Bay of Bengal early next week, weather scientists warned.With three more rain-related deaths in Chennai, Sivaganga and Nilgiris on Friday, the toll went up to 18, minister for revenue and disaster relief, KSSR Ramachandran told reporters.“By tomorrow Chennai will be made alright,” the minister said.The city has been battered by two heavy spells of rains since last Saturday. Chennai recorded 210 mm of rain overnight between November 6 and 7, and on November 12, the average rainfall in the city was 60.6mm over a 24-hour period.Almost all districts in Tamil Nadu have received heavy rainfall and four districts got extreme rainfall from November 7 to 12, Balachandran, head of the Regional Meteorological Centre, Chennai, told reporters on Friday.“Chennai has recorded 46cm (460mm) rainfall, which is five times the average we receive during this period which is about 8 cm,” the RMC head said. From October 1, when the north east monsoon began up to November 12, Chennai has received 81 cm rainfall, while the average is 44 cm.”This is 85% excess,” he added.Even as the city got a breather on Friday, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast another low pressure area forming over the South Andaman sea on Saturday. “In the next two days, Chennai and adjoining areas are likely to see thunderstorms with light and moderate rain in some areas,” said Balachandran.Over the last six days, at least 17,654 Chennai residents called the Greater Chennai Corporation helplines with complaints. Residential areas such as T Nagar, West Mambalam, Madhavaram, and Pattalam were still inundated in deep water, officials said, and 620 motor pumps were used on Friday morning. Authorities in the corporation said that 534 locations in the city were waterlogged, of which they were able to clear 204 by 4pm.Families from low lying areas -- a total of 2,888 people including 464 children -- are housed in 44 relief camps in Chennai.“Our situation hasn’t improved. We still can’t step out and there is no power but water is slowly receding,” said M Ramesh, a resident of Velachery, one of the worst affected low-lying areas in Chennai.The crisis underlined that only temporary patchwork was done after the 2015 tragedy, and no permanent solutions - removing encroachments on flood plains, stopping the dumping of fly ash, municipal waste and industrial effluents on river basins and unclogging decades-old storm water drains – were undertaken.Disaster relief minister Ramachandran blamed the previous AIADMK government for failing to carry out flood mitigation work. “In the previous regime, water was everywhere -- in lakes and on roads,” he said. “The same officials are working now but our CM has the capacity to make them work rapidly for relief and rescue.”On Friday, chief minister MK Stalin inspected flood-affected localities in Chengalpattu and Kancheepuram districts. Stalin tweeted that he opened a medical camp for the monsoon season-related ailments. “Similarly 200 such medical camps will be started in Chennai,” he tweeted.He also handed over an appreciation certificate to police inspector E Rajeswari, whose videos went viral on social media on Thursday after she carried an unconscious man and saving him from drowning.Opposition AIADMK leaders O Panneerselvam and former chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami also distributed relief to flood-affected people in Chennai.Palaniswami defended his party’s regime by recalling that the Union government gave awards to Tamil Nadu for its governance record. “That’s how well we did!” Palaniswami said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chennai-picks-up-pieces-imd-warns-of-more-rain-101636740285386.html
13-11-2021||India||Gujarat civic bodies ban ‘public display’ of non-veg food items||The municipal corporations of Vadodara and Rajkot, both ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), have ordered shopkeepers and hawkers to cover non-vegetarian food, including eggs, saying an open display of the food could hurt religious sentiments.The order issued by the two bodies said that non-vegetarian food on streets hurt religious sentiments of Hindus. It added that smoke emanating from such spots was a health hazard.Rajkot mayor Pradip Dav passed instructions and launched a drive on Tuesday. Two days later, Vadodara Municipal Corporation’s (VMC) standing committee chairman Hitendra Patel on Thursday issued oral directives to the civic body to remove within 15 days all roadside non-vegetarian food stalls if they didn’t properly cover their food items. “The public display of meat, fish, eggs hurts religious sentiments. It should not be visible,” Patel said on Friday, adding that the practice might have continued for decades but now it was time to put a stop to it.The VMC’s directive was inspired by a similar instruction by Dav on November 9. “It hurts the religious sentiments of Hindus on seeing non-vegetarian food hanging when they pass by the road,” he said.The RMC staff has removed non-vegetarian food stalls and kiosks in Fulchhab Chowk, Limbda Chowk and Shastri Maidan in Rajkot. “We are only removing encroachments from main roads. They cause nuisance, traffic snarls and offend religious sentiments of Hindus,” said Dav.Revenue minister Rajendra Trivedi welcomed the move, saying: “The smoke and smell emanating from these non-vegetarian stalls is a health hazard for passers-by.”Leader of Opposition in the VMC, Ami Rawat, said, “No political party or government can decide who should eat what and where...”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gujarat-civic-bodies-want-non-vegetarian-food-stalls-removed-say-it-hurts-religious-sentiments-101636740170263.html

These petitions said the Indian Army was in contempt of the apex court’s March 25 order that said all women short service commission officers (WSSCOs) who qualify with 60% merit, are medically fit and have secured disciplinary and vigilance clearance, are to be granted permanent commission. In all, 514 WSSCOs qualified on the basis of the 60% benchmark, of which 442 were given permanent commission; the other 72 were denied this by the selection board that met in September 2020. One officer opted for premature release from service, reducing the number to 71.On Friday, the ministry of defence submitted an affidavit stating that out of 36 officers, 21 have since been granted permanent commission upon review and letters in this regard were issued to them on October 29. The case of one officer was under consideration , leaving 14. Of this, the affidavit added, three were found to be medically unfit, while there were serious objections against 11 others.After some prodding from the court, it agreed to grant permanent commission to these 11, and also consider similarly, the case of the 36 others who did not file a contempt petition.There was no response from the Army on the development.The women short service commission officers secured their right to permanent commission and command positions in non-combat streams at par with male officers after a prolonged legal battle culminating in the Supreme Court order on February 17, 2020. The women officers again came to the court in September 2020, complaining against the whimsical standards on merit, medical fitness applied by Selection Board to deny them their due. This resulted in the March 25 order.In June, the Centre moved an application for clarification of the judgment stating that the 72 officers denied permanent commission faced serious issues: discipline, disobedience of orders, forging medical documents, poor work ethic, lack of professionalism, un-officer like conduct, and poor performance in courses. The court refused to entertain this application in August and directed the army to comply with the March judgment.In Friday’s hearing, the Centre initially said it would grant permanent commission only to 21 of the 36 who filed the contempt petition. It was very clear that it did not want to grant commission to the 11 against whom there were serious objections.“If service records of the relevant period of these 11 officers is to be taken as the basis, it raises a question on their continuation in the force which is a relevant consideration adopted by the army to deny them permanent commission,” said Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Sanjay Jain, appearing for the Union government. The 11 officers were medically fit.The court wished to know if these officers had secured disciplinary and vigilance clearance to which the ASG replied in the affirmative “As of today, they have those clearances, but there are some weak points against them pertaining to the relevant period.”The court then remarked: “The Army may be supreme in its own authority, but the Constitutional court is supreme in its own jurisdiction. We gave you a long rope and put you on guard that if you go beyond our order (of March), you will invite trouble. We are going to record a finding holding Army guilty of contempt.”It added: “Our directions are very clear. Do not deny these people on some remarks made at some point in the past.”ASG Jain along with senior advocate R Balasubramanian appearing for the Indian Army took an hour’s concession from the Court to discuss the issue with top army and government officials.Returning with instructions in the afternoon, ASG Jain told the Court that the 11 officers shall be granted PC within 10 days and all similarly placed WSSCOs who have not approached the Court in contempt petitions will also be given similar consideration. The Court accepted the stand of the Army and recorded the statement, granting three weeks’ time to consider grant of PC to the remaining officers.ASG Jain said, “The army officers are keen to see this matter attains finality today. We will consider them with open heart and open mind.” Balasubramanian, who too played a crucial part in convincing the army officers to arrive at a consensus, said, “Army is being thrown apart by this litigation. We want to bring an end to these proceedings.” He further pointed out that the Court should state in the order that in peculiar facts of this case as otherwise, it could open a flood of litigations by male short service commission officers who have been denied permanent commission in the past on similar grounds.The Court disposed the contempt petitions and directed the Army authorities to deal with the complaints of two WSSCOs denied PC on medical grounds within a month. The accomplishment of these two officers was mentioned in the March judgment as an ode to the services rendered by the women officers in the army. Senior advocate V Mohana appearing for the two officers said that one officer was shown in low medical category at the relevant period due to her pregnancy while the other officer was being penalised for not producing medical documents of the relevant period.The bench told the Centre, “It is not that she is unfit but that she was pregnant.”However, the Court reiterated, “By way of abundant caution, it is clarified, those officers who have disciplinary and vigilance clearance as of present will be eligible for grant of PC subject to other conditions mentioned in paragraph 120 of our judgment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/permanent-commission-for-women-army-blinks-after-sc-warns-it-of-contempt-101636740164463.html
13-11-2021||India||‘Contrary’ views by CDS, govt on Chinese incursion fan row||Seemingly contradictory views within the government on a village built by China in a disputed area in Arunachal Pradesh and the status of the land on which it sits, ignited a political controversy on Friday with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi accusing the Centre of compromising India’s security.“Our national security is unpardonably compromised because GOI (Government of India) has no strategy and Mr 56” (a jibe at the PM) is scared,” Gandhi wrote on Twitter.The Congress leader attacked the government a day after the ministry of external affairs, in its first response to a US report on the Chinese village, referred to China’s activities in areas it has illegally occupied over the years, and asserted that India will never accept such “illegal occupation” of its territory, even as the country’s senior-most military commander General Bipin Rawat said the Chinese constructions were on its side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC).“My thoughts are with the soldiers risking their lives to guard our borders while GOI churns out lies,” Gandhi added. HT reached out to the defence ministry and the army but they didn’t react to Gandhi’s allegations.Hitting back, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said: “Rahul Gandhi has no moral authority of commenting on National Security. Same Mr Rahul Gandhi had questioned the “Surgical Strike” and dubbed it “Farzical”, had demanded for evidence in case of Air Strike. Rahul Gandhi was caught with the wrong foot during the Doklam Standoff. Defence Minister Mr Antony had mentioned on the floor of parliament that “No Border Infrastructure” was the best policy as far as National Security is concerned. Rahul Should stop opposing just for the sake of Opposition. His hatred for Modi has transformed into hatred for India.”The new Chinese village, which has emerged as a symbol of Beijing’s assertiveness in disputed border areas in the eastern sector, was built in an area held by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) since August 1959.The Indian Army has been aware of the village’s existence for more than a year, but the 100-home village was thrust into the limelight after being mentioned in a US defence department report last week. It is located in disputed territory in Arunachal’s upper Subansiri district.Responding to a question on the report submitted on November 3 by the US department of defence to the Congress, external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi on Thursday told a regular news briefing that China has undertaken construction activities in the past several years along border areas, including in areas it has “illegally occupied over the decades.” “India has neither accepted such illegal occupation of our territory nor has it accepted the unjustified Chinese claims,” he said.The US report said China constructed the village “inside disputed territory” between Tibet and Arunachal Pradesh.Speaking at a conference organised by a TV channel, chief of defence staff General Rawat, however, said China was building infrastructure and the so-called villages on its side of LAC.“They have not transgressed anywhere on our perception of LAC. There are differing perceptions (of LAC). We are very clear where the LAC lies because we have been told that this is your alignment of LAC and this is the territory you are expected to defend,” CDS said, adding that no Chinese village had come up on the Indian side of LAC.There’s some debate on that, though.China has built the village in an area occupied by China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) after overrunning an Assam Rifles post in 1959 in the Longju area, as previously reported by HT. The Longju skirmish, which left two Indian soldiers dead, took place a few months after the 14th Dalai Lama fled Tibet, crossed into India in March 1959 and was later granted political asylum by New Delhi.“Although the Chinese are occupying this area since 1959, our clear position is that Longju is on our side of LAC. We follow the watershed principle for LAC in Arunachal and Longju lies south of the watershed,” said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd).The watershed formed by the highest mountains is an established global principle or norm for border demarcation.“Grey areas” along McMahon Line such as Asaphila, Longju and Khinzemane are places where the Chinese-claimed LAC goes beyond the watershed and is shown as the international border on Indian maps, historian Srinath Raghavan wrote on Twitter on Friday.“PLA patrolling & presence in these areas is often reported by Indian media as an “incursion”… CDS Rawat’s response suggests that the Indian perception of the LAC in this area doesn’t go up to the watershed either. Longju may be an exception among the “grey areas” owing to the longstanding Chinese position,” he added.Some experts, including General Hooda, view the setting up of the Chinese village in the context of a 2005 agreement between India and China on political parameters and guiding principles for the settlement of the India-China boundary question.Article VII of that pact says, “In reaching a boundary settlement, the two sides shall safeguard due interests of their settled populations in the border areas.”Eastern Army commander Lieutenant General Manoj Pande last month flagged concerns about the “dual use” of villages being set up by China in forward areas, and said the army was factoring in the development in its operational planning.PLA has intensified patrolling in sensitive areas across LAC in Arunachal Pradesh after a lingering standoff with India began last year in the Ladakh sector. It has ramped up area domination patrols for surveillance and orientation of newly inducted troops with a noticeable increase in visits by senior PLA officers to forward areas to supervise the military activities in the eastern sector.The sectors across which the Indian Army has detected increased PLA activities include Lungro La, Zimithang and Bum La --- areas of high historical significance in the context of Chinese aggression in the eastern sector --- and counter measures have been taken to boost India’s readiness to handle any contingency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/contrary-views-by-cds-govt-on-chinese-incursion-fan-row-101636740106107.html

These haven't||As many as 25 states and Union territories have reduced Value Added Tax (VAT) on petrol and diesel to provide relief to consumers. The decision of states and UTs to cut VAT on petrol and diesel followed the Centre's announcement to significantly reduce central excise duty on these fuels on Diwali eve. Most of the states that announced a reduction in VAT on petrol or diesel are either ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) or its allies.The ministry of petroleum & natural gas said the states and UTs which have not undertaken any reduction in VAT on petrol and diesel are: Maharashtra, NCT of Delhi, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Jharkhand, Chattisgarh and Rajasthan.Punjab has recorded the highest cut in petrol price after the Central and the state government announced a reduction in central excise duty and VAT respectively. The petrol price in Punjab has come down by ₹16.02 per litre, followed by ₹13.43 in UT of Ladakh and ₹13.35 in Karnataka. Andaman & Nicobar consumers are getting petrol at the cheapest price ( ₹82.96 per litre) in the country while Itanagar is selling the fuel at ₹92.02 per litre.

The two were apprehended from Delhi’s Dwarka area. One licensed revolver has been recovered from Barak’s possession. Sachin Dahiya was previously arrested in two cases of the Arms Act in Haryana, said deputy police commissioner (special cell) Sanjeev Kumar Yadav.“The two men were wanted in the double murder case registered at the Kharkhoda police station in Haryana’s Sonepat,” said Yadav.Also Read: Witness in murder trial found dead with gunshot wound to head in DelhiA Special Investigation Team of the Sonepat Police on Thursday arrested Barak’s wife, Sujata, and her brother, Amit, in connection with the double murder. Barak and Sachin Dahiya were the prime suspects in the case and were absconding. The Haryana police announced ₹1 lakh reward for information leading to their arrest.The reports of the murder triggered confusion as the university-level wrestler was a namesake of a bronze medal winner at the Under-23 World Championship.In her statement to the Haryana Police, Dhanpati alleged Pawan Barak, also the owner of the academy, fired at them after her daughter accused him of harassing her. “My daughter informed me earlier too that Pawan often misbehaved with her. When we talked to the accused about this, he promised not to repeat such acts.”She said on Wednesday, her daughter went to the academy for training and returned home. “At 1pm, she went to the academy again. We received a call from Pawan saying Nisha was not feeling well, and he asked us to take her home. When I and my son Suraj reached there, we saw Pawan, his wife Sujata, and two others rushing towards Nisha near the main gate of the academy. She told me that Pawan had misbehaved with her and threatened to kill her if she narrated the incident to anyone.”Pawan Barak then allegedly pulled out a gun and fired multiple shots. “She collapsed after receiving bullet wounds. Pawan then fired shots at me and chased my son Suraj, who was running towards the village. I saw them firing several bullets, which hit him and he too died on the spot.”The slain wrestler’s father, Dayanand Dahiya, a sub-inspector in the Central Reserve Police Force, has alleged that Pawan Barak extorted ₹8-10 lakh from them in the name of sending their daughter to foreign tournaments.“Pawan brainwashed my daughter and she used to follow his directions. On his advice, Nisha did not appear in her exams and the coach did not pay us ₹50,000 won by Nisha in a tournament in Maharashtra. He had also taken money from my daughter to prepare her another birth certificate with a lower age.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonepat-murders-prime-suspects-behind-killings-of-wrestler-her-brother-held-101636713343935.html
13-11-2021||India||Withdraw Padmashri, National Awards given to Kangana: MVA||The allies of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi slammed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over actor Kangana Ranaut’s controversial statement on India’s independence. The Shiv Sena on Friday said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP national president JP Nadda must clarify the meaning of the statement and withdraw the awards given to her.Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said that the Government of India must take back all the awards it has given to the actor. Congress, also a part of the ruling coalition in Maharashtra, called Ranaut a “puppet” of the BJP.The actor triggered a controversy by describing India’s Independence in 1947 as ‘bheek’ or alms. In a 24-second video clip that has gone viral on social media, Ranaut also said: “And we got real freedom in 2014.” She was speaking at an event organised by a news channel.Senior Congress leader Tariq Anwar said that there is likely to be a conspiracy by the BJP behind the remarks by Kangana Ranaut. “She is an ardent Modi admirer and has never spoken against him. BJP’s central leadership has not uttered a word on her remarks. This raises doubts that there could be a conspiracy by the BJP to defame the freedom fighters and glorify the Modi rule. The Padmashri should immediately be taken back and a case of sedition be registered against her,” he said in Mumbai. Mumbai Congress chief Bhai Jagtap said that they would stage protests in various parts of the city against Ranaut.“BJP will have to speak out on this issue. All the National Awards given to Kangana ben should be taken back. If the government does not take back these awards, then it does not have the right to celebrate the Amrut Mahotsav (75th year) of Independence,” Raut said.Maharashtra Congress’s general secretary Sachin Sawant tweeted, “Kangana is BJP’s Jhansi Ki Rani who dares to insult the freedom struggle and sacrifices of the freedom fighters, martyrs by saying ‘Azadi Bhik Mein Mili Hai’. Such puppets are nurtured by BJP deliberately for this filth. These parrots are not the real culprits but their masters are”NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik said that the actor must have taken an overdose of some addictive grown in Malana Valley of Himachal Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/withdraw-national-awards-given-to-kangana-demand-mva-allies-ask-pm-to-clarify-101636711543657.html

The position has traditionally been reserved for Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officers or senior parliament secretariat officers.Former Uttarakhand cadre IAS officer Utpal Kumar Singh is the current Lok Sabha secretary general.“PC Mody, former chairman of the CBDT, will be the new secretary general of Rajya Sabha. Rajya Sabha chairman M Venkaiah Naidu, the appointing authority, signed the order of appointment to this effect,” said a senior official.Two senior Opposition leaders, who asked not to be named, expressed surprise at the change of guard.Senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh, in a tweet, said “Not surprised at all. Dr. PPK Ramacharyulu is a thorough professional, non-partisan and perfectly qualified for the post—three deadly sins in the Modi regime.”Mody, who is likely to take charge on Friday, is a 1982 IRS officer who was given three extensions as CBDT chairman since August 2019.Ramacharyulu, secretary general since September 1, has been appointed as an adviser to the Rajya Sabha chairman.The secretary general heads the secretariat of the House and is the key lieutenant to the chair for running the affairs.A secretary-general is appointed by the Chair of the respective House.

Covaxin is the only Covid-19 vaccine to have demonstrated efficacy data from Phase 3 clinical trials against the Delta variant at 65.2%,” said Bharat Biotech in a statement on Friday.The efficacy analysis was done after the evaluation of 130 confirmed Covid-19 cases, with 24 observed in the vaccine group as against 106 in the placebo group, the article said.Bharat Biotech developed the anti-Covid jab in partnership with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the National Institute of Virology in Pune. WHO, on November 3, issued a Emergency Use Listing for Covaxin, which has been part of India’s vaccine programme since January. Of the 1.1 billion vaccine doses administered till Friday evening in India, over 125 million, or 11% are of Covaxin.The company received strains of Sars-CoV-2 isolated by the Indian government’s apex virology laboratory in March 2020.“The peer review of Covaxin’s Phase 3 clinical trial data in The Lancet, an authoritative voice in global medicine, validates our commitment to data transparency and meeting the stringent peer review standards of world-leading medical journals,” Krishna Ella, chairman and managing director of Bharat Biotech, said in a statement.“The data from our product development and clinical trials has been published in 10 peer-reviewed journals, making Covaxin one of the most highly published Covid-19 vaccines in the world. This accomplishment reflects the undeterred commitment by my team members at Bharat Biotech, our public partners, ICMR, the National Institute of Virology and the trust imposed by our trial participants who made this happen,” Ella said.The long gap between the publication of Covaxin’s Phase 3 results in a release and in a peer-reviewed journal and the delay in WHO granting an EUL to the vaccine had become talking points. Pfizer, whose vaccine was approved for emergency use by the US drug regulator in December 2020, published its Phase 3 results in a peer-reviewed journal in the same month.Oxford/AstraZeneca’s vaccine was approved for use by the UK regulator in December 2020. Covaxin was approved by India’s drug regulator before interim results of its Phase 3 trials were available, and the company finally published these in a release in June 2021.Balram Bhargava, director general of the ICMR, said, “Following successful isolation of the Sars-CoV-2 virus at the ICMR-National Institute of Virology in Pune, ICMR and Bharat Biotech embarked upon one of the most successful public-private partnerships to develop the virus isolate into an effective Covid-19 vaccine. “I am delighted to see that the Phase 3 efficacy data has also been published in The Lancet, one of the most reputed journals worldwide. It speaks highly about the strong position of Covaxin among other global front-runners [with respect to] Covid-19 vaccines...” he added. According to the company, its emergency-use authorisation application is in process in at least 50 countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-vaccine-covaxin-s-phase-3-trial-data-published-in-lancet-101636686641937.html
13-11-2021||India||Anti-Covid pill likely to get approved in India soon, DCGI reviewing data||The Drugs Controller General of India is reviewing the clinical data of molnupiravir, the world's first anti-Covid pill approved in the United Kingdom, for the treatment of Covid-19 in adults in India. Sun Pharmaceutical Industries said it is all set to introduce Merck Sharp Dohme (MSD) and Ridgeback's molnupiravir under the brand name Molxvir.Sun Pharma is one of the companies in India with which Merck entered into voluntary licensing agreements."The recent authorisation of molnupiravir, licensed from MSD and Ridgeback, by the UK regulator is a positive step. In line with our consistent efforts to accelerate access to new drugs for COVID-19 treatment, we are gearing up to make Molxvir available to patients and healthcare providers across India at an economical price post-approval by DCGI," Sun Pharma India Business CEO Kirti Ganorkar said in a statement.The United States is also going through the data of molnupiravir.Who can take this pill? Adults who are at risk of Covid can take this pill to avoid severe symptoms or hospitalisation. However, experts have warned that anti-Covid pills are not alternatives to vaccines. The pill can be taken within the first few days of Covid symptoms appearing.Molnupiravir, as a small molecule, does not require cold storage like messenger RNA vaccines. In the Phase 3 trial by Merck, Molnupiravir significantly reduced the risk of hospitalisation or death by around 50 per cent in a planned interim analysis of the MOVe-OUT trial in at risk, non-hospitalised adult patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19.Based on the participants with available viral sequencing data (around 40 per cent of participants), molnupiravir demonstrated consistent efficacy across viral variants like Gamma, Delta and Mu.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/anticovid-pill-likely-to-get-approved-in-india-soon-dcgi-reviewing-data-101636680456713.html
13-11-2021||Today's||Of politicians and the free press in a democracy||Have you ever chosen to read a book for one specific reason only to find you end up admiring it for quite another? It happened to me earlier this month when I chose a Cambridge chum’s recently published autobiography for company on a nine-hour flight to London. Andrew Mitchell was a member of David Cameron’s cabinet destined to climb the heights. He’d been offered the defence ministry but preferred to continue as secretary of state for international development because of a deep commitment to the subject. Then tragedy struck.

13-11-2021||Today's||The importance of grief counselling for children||Covid-19 has caused enormous suffering among all segments, but particularly vulnerable have been children who have lost a parent. The surviving parent is often so preoccupied with basic issues of survival that the child’s emotional trauma goes unattended.
13-11-2021||Today's||The centralisation of politics and business||In September 2020, protests against three controversial farm bills passed by Parliament erupted. While there may be legitimate arguments in favour and against the farm bills, the protests quickly began to coalesce around a larger criticism of “corporate interests” supported by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). To my mind, the persistence of these protests has less to do with reforms in the agricultural sector (which are quite necessary) and more to do with the rapid economic centralisation and the changing face of business-politics relations in India.
