There has to be a survey by a committee, nothing of that has happened. The plan has not even been prepared. It cannot be that in the meantime the whole city is open. Anybody can walk in and start hawking and vending. The whole city will become a jungle… This cannot be permitted,” a bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Amit Bansal remarked.The court, while hearing a plea by the New Delhi Traders Association (NDTA) seeking removal of unauthorised hawking in the CP area, stressed on the need for proper implementation of the Street Vendors Act to have an organised activity of vending.The court directed local authorities, including the municipal corporations, to initiate the process of preparing the statutory street vending plan under the Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Act.“The steps taken in this regard be placed before the court on the next date of hearing,” the court said.The court also asked the authorities, including the Delhi government and the municipal bodies, to take help from the experts of Public Works Department, School of Planning and Architecture, IIT and other planning bodies to formulate a street vending plan which would set the specifications for density of vendors and norms for walkways in markets.“You need to implement the Act properly. There is no street vending plan. The way the constitution of the Town Vending Committee (TVC) has been done is actually shocking. We are dealing with the NDMC area and without CP area, it does not have its character and meaning,” the bench said.“We take the Act, the rules and the scheme are good, the problem is in the implementation. Our objective is to not take it adversely. We want all the wings of administration, whether the GNCTD or corporations, to implement the provisions of the Act, then to our mind, we will have a city where it will be an organised activity of vending,” said the court, adding that street vending is an age-old activity.The court, on October 11, had directed the removal of illegal encroachers and vendors from the CP area and directed the authorities to ensure that the area remained clean.The petitioner, represented through senior advocate Sanjeev Ralli, sought that the authorities be directed to ensure the areas are kept free from encroachments by illegal hawkers and vendors.The court was informed by senior advocate Rahul Mehra, representing the Delhi Police, that drives have been carried out by the NDMC and police for removal of illegal encroachers and five FIRs have been registered. He said the court’s order was fully complied with by the authorities.The NDMC counsel also said illegal hawkers and vendors were removed but the drive needs to be carried daily.Regarding the Regal Cinema building, Ralli informed the court that earlier no action was taken against illegal hawkers sitting there and a removal drive was carried on November 6 after he informed the authorities that action has to be taken there also.The court observed that it was conscious of the fact that vendors also have fundamental rights but pointed out that it is not absolute. The bench said its concern was that it has to see and balance it with the rights of other citizens.“We want to ensure all wings of administration, be it MCD or Delhi government, shall implement the Act in its letter and spirit,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/the-city-will-become-a-jungle-delhi-hc-pulls-up-authorities-over-hawking-plan-101636396021296.html

Falwinder Verma, an assistant professor at the college, blamed the state government for adopting poor administrative and educational policies.“The new posts have been created in lieu of the assistant professors already teaching at government colleges in the state. The new candidates will he hired and we will lose our employment. The government should have created new posts. There are a total 906 guest faculties working in these colleges for the past 20 years and instead of being regularised, they will be shunt out soon,” said Verma.He added that the government now wants the guest faculties already recruited in these colleges to compete with the new candidates and appear in the common test scheduled this month.“Many teachers are in their early 50s or 40s. They were recruited after appearing in tests around 20 years back. How can the government expect them to compete with the young brains? This is totally unfair as our families will be affected adversely,” he added.Manvir Singh, guest faculty deputed in fine arts department, said, “We started working for a salary of ₹7,000. We supported the government in its bad times and now its policies will damage our lives.

The commission has also issued a notice to the Delhi Police crime branch, asking them to register a case in the matter.In a press statement issued on Monday, the DCW said the commission had received “several complaints” of alleged prostitution rackets being run from spas in the city, which prompted them to set up a team to look probe the allegations. The team used JustDial and asked for contact details of spas operating in south Delhi.“Within 24 hours, the team received over 15 calls and 32 WhatsApp messages from spas, with pictures of more than 150 young girls, along with the rates of their ‘services’. While the team only requested details for spa service, the same was automatically construed as a request for sex and the so-called spas immediately provided details regarding the illegal prostitution activities they were indulging in,” said the DCW statement. The commission asked the Delhi Police’s crime branch to register an FIR. It also issued a notice to the managing director (MD) of Justdial Limited, seeking their presence before the commission on November 12, along with details explaining the company’s policy for background checks of the ‘spas’ listed with them. They have been also asked to inform the details of the spas which sent the commission’s team the messages for providing sexual services as well as the amount of money taken by Justdial to list them on their site. Justdial could not be reached for comment on the matter.DCW chairperson Swati Maliwal said, “The blatancy and impunity with which prostitution rackets are operating in the Capital is shocking. We have summoned Justdial to investigate their role in the matter and have also issued a notice to Delhi Police for immediately registering a FIR and arrest the people involved. The commission is against objectification and commercial sexual exploitation of girls and their and shall leave no stone unturned to stop it.”A police officer, who did not want to be named said, “Action will be taken as per the law once we receive the notice and conduct an inquiry into the allegations”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-commission-for-women-sends-notice-to-justdial-for-helping-sex-rackets-101636395661204.html

Petrol and diesel are still under the old taxation system of VAT and are yet to be brought under the GST. “The Centre has done precious little to bring down prices of petrol and diesel. Their prices are still very high. The Centre must bring petrol and diesel under the GST to control their price. Without doing this, prices of these two products cannot be controlled,” Singh told media persons. Singh also demanded to increase the amount for purchasing two pairs of uniform, a pair of socks, a sweater and a school bag, from ₹1,100 to ₹3,000 per student, which the Yogi government would transfer into the bank accounts of parents of each student studying in government-aided schools. Recently, the state government has ordered to transfer ₹1,100 directly into the bank accounts of parents of each student studying in government schools. The AAP has decided to contest the forthcoming assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh and has also announced names of probable candidates for over 100 assembly constituencies. As its first promise to electorates of the state, the AAP has announced 300 units of free electricity for every household. With this, the AAP aims to make inroads into UP where the ruling BJP is facing tough challenge from Samajwadi Party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/uttar-pradesh-aap-for-bringing-petrol-and-diesel-under-gst-101636395241107.html

The air quality is expected to fluctuate between the ‘severe’ and the higher end of the ‘very poor’ category over the next few days.In Gurugram, the air quality was in the ‘severe’ category of CPCB’s classification for three days after Diwali. The air quality improved slightly on Monday and reached the ‘very poor’ zone, with PM 2.5 as the prominent pollutant.The minutes of the CPCB meeting stated, “It was observed that due to sudden and unforeseeable change in meteorological factors, substantially high emissions on account of bursting of firecrackers and other local sources, and high contribution of stubble burning, the air quality of Delhi declined to ‘severe’ category but is in ‘very poor’ category now (on Monday).”The CPCB ordered 60 agencies in the National Capital Region (NCR), including the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), Municipal Corporation Faridabad (MCF), deputy commissioner of Gurugram traffic police, chief executive officer Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), to implement “actions under severe category, in addition to steps listed under very poor and poor to moderate AQI categories” with immediate effect.S Narayanan, member secretary of Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) said that an order for implementing measures under the ‘severe’ category of Grap will be issued and all orders of the CPCB would be followed.Kuldeep Singh, the regional officer of HSPCB for Gurugram north, said, “In the past three days, since air quality reached ‘severe’ category, we enhanced sprinkling of water and mechanised cleaning of hotspots across Gurugram to control further deterioration of air quality. We have been continuously coordinating with all agencies like district administration, urban local bodies, Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran and even private agencies, like industrial associations and builders, to implement these activities. All ground staff have also been informed to share pictures along with time and location as soon as they carry out sprinkling of water on roads.”The actions under ‘severe’ Grap mention increasing the frequency of mechanised cleaning of roads and sprinkling water on roads, identifying road stretches with high dust generation, ensuring that all brick kilns remain closed, as per directions of the National Green Tribunal (NGT), closure of hot mix plants and stone crushers, maximising the generation of power from existing natural gas-based plants to reduce the operation of coal-based power plants and intensifying public transport services, with the introduction of differential rates to encourage off-peak travel.On Monday, Gurugram also recorded a minimum temperature of 13.9 degrees Celsius (°C), the lowest of the current winter season, while the maximum temperature was 27°C, which was three degrees below normal. Officials said that the normal minimum temperature is 12.6°C.“This is the first time this season that the minimum temperature has gone below 15°C, which means that we are approaching winter. Over the next three to four days, the minimum temperature will keep reducing gradually by 0.3-0.4°C daily. Due to this, air quality can get impacted. South Haryana might see cloudy skies due to formation of cyclonic circulation over the Bay of Bengal, but it will not rain,” said Manmohan Singh, director of Meteorological Centre Chandigarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/pollution-action-plan-to-be-enacted-in-entirety-as-air-quality-hovers-around-severe-levels-101636394702628.html

This will be in addition to vaccinations at the usual session sites and the door-to-door vaccination drive. “We have chosen Covaxin for this drive as through this vaccine, we can ensure that pregnant women get their first and second doses of Covid-19 vaccine faster during their pregnancy term. If a woman gets infected with coronavirus during pregnancy, then there could be chances of premature delivery with the baby’s weight being less than 2.5 kilograms. In some cases, the risk of fatality also increases, due to which we want to make sure that pregnant women are vaccinated faster,” said Dr MP Singh, the district immunisation officer. Singh said that if a pregnant woman, unvaccinated or partially vaccinated, gets infected with Covid-19, they will receive the remaining doses only after the delivery. For this drive, 7,400 doses of the vaccine will be available on Tuesday, with 3,700 for each dose. This is the second time that a dedicated vaccination drive is being conducted for pregnant women in the district.In addition to this drive, vaccination will continue at the 43 fixed vaccination sites across the district on Tuesday, officials said. The first and second doses of Covishield will be administered at 36 centres, while the second dose of Covaxin will be administered at five centres. Sputnik V vaccines will be administered at the Sector 31 polyclinic, while door-to-door vaccinations will be carried out at 196 localities on Tuesday. On Monday, 14,208 people were given the Covid-19 vaccines in the district, with 3,703 people being administered the first dose and 10,505 being given the second dose of the vaccines. Meanwhile, in anticipation of the third wave of Covid-19 infections and augmenting health infrastructure, the state health department has sought feasibility reports from 11 districts, including six districts of south Haryana, for construction of 50-bed Covid-19 hospitals adjacent to the district Civil Hospital, as part of the Central government scheme in this regard. Rajeev Arora, the health secretary for the state, said, “Our first focus is to increase the pace of vaccination across the state with different methods, such as vaccination at fixed sites, door-to-door vaccination, special drives; but we also have to prepare in case there is a third wave of Covid-19. During the festive season, we saw that the vaccination pace was slow and people have also become more relaxed as cases have come down. But we are conducting surveys to understand the bed capacity in different districts and increase it as per the need.” Arora said that the chief minister is scheduled to conduct a review meeting on Friday with all deputy commissioners to take stock of the vaccination status and health infrastructure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/covid19-vaccination-pregnant-women-to-be-given-covaxin-in-special-drive-101636394700993.html

They, however, sought action against people for allegedly making provocative speeches and raising communal slogans during Govardhan Puja rituals at the site last Friday.Members of the Muslim community also sought police protection to offer namaz at the other designated sites, citing scarcity of closed spaces for offering Friday prayers. Members of the Muslim community, after holding meetings on Monday, decided to offer namaz at 28 sites designated by the district administration.Altaf Ahmad, a member of Gurgaon Nagrik Ekta Manch and spokesperson for Gurgaon Muslim Council, said that they have requested the deputy commissioner to take cognisance of the provocative speeches. “The videos have gone viral and have brought disrepute to our nation. Hence, the hatemongers should be booked immediately for hurting religious sentiments of the Muslim community,” he said. Mohammad Adeeb, a former Rajya Sabha member, who is leading a 21-member committee to resolve the ongoing issue, said that they have assured the administration of their continued support in resolving the Juma Namaz issue in a “pragmatic and peaceful manner.” “There are only 13 mosques in Gurugram city for a population of over five lakhs (0.5 million). Given there are such few and far off masjids, with capacity of hardly a few hundred, praying once a week in the open is a desperate necessity and not preferred by the devotees,” Adeeb said. Members of the 21-member committee, constituted last Saturday, said that they will not visit the Sector 12 site on Friday to avoid confrontation with right-wing groups who participated in Govardhan Puja. Members said they will also meet Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Wednesday to apprise him of the situation and to seek the government’s assistance for setting up an adequate number of mosques in Gurugram. The group plans to meet residents’ welfare association members (RWAs) and members of political parties to apprise them of the needs and challenges of the community and to build mutual trust, members said. Adeeb said that Muslim groups have voluntarily and pre-emptively reviewed their prayer sites and relocated if the congregations caused any problems, such as traffic disruptions. “The Muslim community has been seeking both private and government land for constructing mosques, which has not been forthcoming. One of the only two operational masjids in New Gurugram is under litigation in Supreme Court, despite legitimate allotment. We have urged the administration to review the allotments and the places of worship that have come up in Gurugram over the past three decades, as the fewest and most inadequate are of masjids,” he said. Ahmad said that a delegation of the city’s Muslims discussed the ongoing issues with the deputy commissioner on Monday and was assured of protection at the designated sites.Yash Garg, the deputy commissioner of Gurugram, said that the administration is trying to stabilise the ongoing issue and ensure communal harmony in the city. “We have formed a special committee and heavy police deployment is done at all namaz sites. Strict action is being taken against anyone disrupting namaz,” he said. A senior police official, requesting anonymity, said that they have not received any complaints about alleged sloganeering against the Muslim community. “We will take action once we receive a written complaint,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/namaz-row-muslims-seek-more-mosques-action-over-hateful-sloganeering-101636394641085.html

Most of the foreign tourists, who visited Varanasi during this period, were nationals of USA, England, Israel, Poland, Mozambique, Japan, Russia, France, Germany and Romania, the officer said. “However, many of the tourists are travelling to Varanasi from cities like Riahikesh, Bangalore and Delhi where they were staying temporarily. They now prefer shorter journey as they got stuck in many cities when the Covid-19 had broken out over 17 months ago,” said the officer. According to the tourism department, many tourists also reached Varanasi via Nepal. Most of them spent around four to seven days and went back. At present, around 30 tourists are in Varanasi and they can be seen sitting on ghats. On Monday, some foreigners were seen at Tulsi Ghat. They were enjoying traditional ‘Naag Nathaiya Leela’ being performed in river Ganga. It is held every year few days after Deepawali. Naag Nathiaya depicts Lord Krishna’s victory over serpent Kalia.

There are at least three other police personnel, including two deputy commissioner of police (DCP)-rank officers, who were named accused in the case.CID in a statement said that after collecting evidence, it arrested Gopale and Korke on Monday and would produce them in a local court in Mumbai on Tuesday.Special public prosecutor Shekhar Jagtap said that the accused officers had allegedly extorted cash worth ₹50 lakh through a hawala operator from Sharad Agrawal, the nephew of the complainant, by threatening to arrest his uncle in a false case. The hawala operator is an old associate of Sanjay Punamiya, one of the accused in the case and Agarwal’s ex-business partner, Jagtap said.“The CID officers have managed to obtained scientific evidence against the two officers that indicated that they have accepted ₹50 lakh in cash,” Jagtap added.The CID is probing an FIR filed on Agarwal’s complaint at Marine Drive police station. Agrawal had alleged that early this year, Juhu police had filed an extortion case, accusing him of having links with underworld don Chhota Shakeel. Later, the police applied Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) in the case. Agrawal claimed that based on this false case, Singh and his subordinates extorted money from him at the behest of Punamiya, who is the main accused in the case.A few days later, Gopale, who was then Mumbai crime branch unit 9 in-charge, raided Agrawal’s Bhayander and Vile Parle residences. During these raids, the accused police officers had illegally seized some partnership documents and other papers without making any official entry. Later, the photocopies of these documents were found from Punamiya’s possession, stated the FIR filed by Marine Drive police. Singh is wanted by multiple law enforcement agencies and the CID is probing at least three of the five FIRs filed against him.There have already been two non-bailable warrants issued against Singh. A look-out circular (LoC) has also been issued against the former Mumbai Police chief. Apart from this, two open inquiries have also been initiated against the 1988-batch senior Indian Police Service (IPS) officer by the state anti-corruption bureau (ACB) over the corruption allegations made against him by two serving police inspectors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/15-crore-extortion-case-against-param-bir-singh-maharashtra-cid-arrests-2-cops-101636394160923.html

After Banerjee’s call, the Governor reportedly changed his decision and allowed Biman Banerjee to administer the oath.In September, Dhankhar took away the power of the speaker to administer oath and vested it with himself. On Monday, he wrote to the assembly secretariat saying deputy speaker Asish Banerjee can administer the oath on his behalf as he would not be able to attend the oath-taking ceremony at the assembly house on Tuesday.As this caused an embarrassment for the speaker and the ruling party, chief minister Mamata Banerjee stepped in on Monday evening, top TMC leaders said.According to the convention, it is the speaker who administers the oath to legislators while the Governor administers the oath of office to ministers.“The Governor first said he was delegating the power to the deputy speaker as he would not be able to attend the ceremony. When Mamata Banerjee personally called him up, Dhankhar agreed to empower the speaker to administer the oath of office to Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay, Udayan Guha, Brajakishore Goswami and Subrata Mondal. Another unnecessary crisis was averted,” a senior TMC leader, who is known to be close to the Bengal CM, told HT. The TMC won Khardah, Dinhata, Santipur and Gosaba, securing 75% of the overall votes polled in these polls. Partha Chatterjee, cabinet minister and leader of the TMC’s legislative party, wrote to Dhankhar, requesting him to administer the oath of office to the winners. “The Governor informed us that he cannot come. We will make some arrangement,” Chatterjee said at the assembly house on Monday afternoon when the drama unfolded. Mamata Banerjee stepped in hours after Chatterjee wrote to the governor again, requesting him to empower the speaker.Raj Bhawan officials did not comment on the incident.“I will not make any comment. Wait till tomorrow and see what happens,” the speaker told HT on Monday evening.Assembly officials said on condition of anonymity that a note from Raj Bhawan reached the office of the speaker a few days before the September 30 assembly by-poll at Kolkata’s Bhabanipur and polls at two seats in Murshidabad district. The letter cited Section 188 of the Constitution which empowers the Governor to administer the oath.Article 188 deals with the oath or affirmation of lawmakers. “Every member of the Legislative Assembly or the Legislative Council of a State shall, before taking his seat, make and subscribe before the Governor, or some person appointed in that behalf by him, an oath or affirmation according to the form set out for the purpose in the Third Schedule,” it says.Mamata Banerjee, who was defeated at Nandigram six months ago, contested and won her old Bhawanipore seat. The Governor came to the assembly and read out the oath on October 7.To continue as the chief minister, the TMC president needed to be sworn in as a member of the assembly by November 4. Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay, who won the Bhawanipore seat in the March-April polls, stepped down for her. He successfully contested the Khardah seat which fell vacant after TMC’s Kajal Sinha died after winning it.The Governor’s decision forced the TMC to reschedule Mamata Banerjee’s oath-taking, which was initially planned for October 4.On October 1, the government had written to the Governor, asking him to authorize the speaker to conduct the programme but Dhankhar sought a gazette notification on the Bhawanipore bypoll results. Partha Chatterjee and Tapas Roy, the assembly’s deputy chief whip, met the speaker on October 4 and sent a formal request to the Governor to come to the assembly on October 7. A gazette notification on the Bhawanipore results was also issued. The Governor subsequently agreed to attend the ceremony. Biman Banerjee and Dhankar had earlier clashed over the latter’s request for a live telecast of his speech at the assembly. The speaker did not allow this. The speaker has also complained that Dhankhar was interfering in his work.In a strongly worded letter sent to the speaker on September 15, the Governor said, “Under Article 176 of the Constitution, I addressed the assembly on February 7, 2020, and July 2, 2021. On both occasions, in an ‘emergency’ kind of a situation, the address was blacked out.”“I would urge you to engage in soul-searching, believe in constitutional essence and spirit, and dictate the actions and conduct duly mindful of constitutional prescriptions and propriety demanded by the office you hold,” Dhankhar added.Former principal of Presidency College and constitutional expert Amal Mukhopadhyay said, “Since 1952, the standing convention is that governors authorize assembly speakers to administer the oath of office to legislators. The speaker is the master of the House. The Constitution says that any member of the assembly can be appointed by the governor for the job. But ignoring the speaker in this case, and appointing the deputy speaker as his representative to administer the oath, was a wrong move on the part of the governor.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/guvs-order-triggers-drama-before-oath-taking-by-tmc-s-bypoll-winners-cm-steps-in-101636393742812.html
08-11-2021||Mumbai||Men should not interfere in work of women sarpanches: Maha minister||Maharashtra industries minister Subhash Desai on Monday said men should not interfere in the work of women sarpanches and let them learn through experience. Delivering a valedictory speech at the conference of woman sarpanches, organised by the Aurangabad Zilla Parishad Aurangabad and MLCs Ambadas Danve and Manisha Kayande, the minister said the representation of women in local governing bodies is going up. "This representation is more than 50 per cent in Aurangabad as far as the number of women sarpanches is concerned. This means villagers have shown more faith in women. If a woman is backed for a good cause, there will be no need to search women candidates during elections," the Shiv Sena leader said. He said men should less interfere in the work of women sarpanches and they be allowed to learn by experience. Desai said the state government was planning to bring a rule mandating senior officials to visit gram panchayats and explain new schemes to members. He said women sarpanches should visit their offices and go through letters and resolutions issued by the government. Minister of employment guarantee scheme Sandipan Bhumre said the government is giving a good amount of funds to build roads up to farms in rural areas. "The Employment Guarantee scheme is the only portfolio which didn't see any cut in funds amid the pandemic. Now leaders in western Maharashtra are giving examples of infrastructure development in the Marathwada region," he said. Danve said of the total 862 gram panchayats in the Aurangabad district, 585 panchayats are led by women, which shows that the number of gram panchayats led by women is more than the reservation (50 per cent) granted by the Constitution. Speaking on the occasion, a woman sarpanch said the mistakes of computer operators lead to exclusion of the needy from various schemes of the government. "Sarpanches should be given the authority to deposit the salary of these operators instead of doing it through their appointing agency," Sarpanch Varsha Jadhav said. She said members of gram panchayats should also be trained. "The disbursement of funds by gram panchayats is done online. But there is a fear about the possible misuse of digital signatures. I feel the work of gram panchayats should be allowed in offline mode to some extent," she said. Vanmala Nikam, the sarpanch of Gondegaon, said her village boasts of the first air-conditioned bus stop in Maharashtra. Vahegaon sarpanch Vaishali Shinde underlined the issues of growing addiction among youth and child marriage. "More schools are needed to stop marriages of underage girls," she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/men-should-not-interfere-in-work-of-women-sarpanches-maha-minister-101636392885264.html
08-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi HC suggests courtrooms in jails, automated gates to enhance security||Proposing a slew of measures for enhancing security in the district courts of the national capital, the Delhi high court on Monday said special courtrooms may be created within jails to hold hearings related to high-risk prisoners, so that their physical appearance before the courts is reduced.While hearing a suo motu petition, taken up after jailed gangster Jitendra Maan Gogi was shot dead inside the Rohini court in September, a bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh said the appearance of high-risk prisoners before the courts should be ensured, as far as possible, only through the virtual mode.When and if they are required to be physically present, the court suggested that proceedings be conducted inside vulnerable witness deposition courtrooms or inside jails. To facilitate such hearings, prison authorities will have to create a well-equipped courtroom in each jail complex, the bench said. It, however, clarified that these were “suggestions and not directions”.The court said it expected the full cooperation of the Delhi government, police and lawyers to enhance the safety and security of courts and suggested the strict regulation of entry to judicial complexes by deploying an appropriate number of personnel, based on a security audit.It proposed that the state government be accountable for allocation of budget for the purchase of security devices and as the police have the expertise, they should purchase them under intimation to the government and the court.The bench clarified that it will issue appropriate “directions” to the authorities after all stakeholders have first perused the suggestions “summarised” by it.The court said based on the suggestions received from Delhi Police and various lawyer bodies, it made its own “summary” which may be put into practise. The police commissioner will put together a team of experts for a security audit of courts and deploy an appropriate number of personnel accordingly, the court said.It suggested that everyone, including advocates, be subjected to frisking, which is “quick and efficient”, and all are made to pass through metal detectors. No baggage may be allowed inside courts without being scanned. The court also suggested placing all court complexes under round-the-clock CCTV monitoring, issuing “stickers” to vehicles that may be permitted entry inside a court complex and installing under vehicle scanning systems as well as automated gates to tackle crowds.The court further said the Bar Council of Delhi should devise a mechanism to issue non-transferable identity cards having a QR-code or a chip to lawyers.During the hearing, additional solicitor general Chetan Sharma said the police have already conducted a safety audit and the Security Unit of Delhi Police has taken over the responsibility of court security. ASG Sharma highlighted that during Diwali, certain lawyers in Rohini courts raised objections to being subjected to security checks.“You (Bar bodies) should pass a resolution so that there may not be any negative reaction. Lawyers should have faith in leaders; otherwise no work will be done,” the chief justice said.On September 24, jailed gangster Jitendra Maan Gogi, who was produced before the Rohini courts in connection with a case trial, was gunned down inside the courtroom by two men posing as lawyers. The two assailants were killed in the retaliatory firing by the police. Police later said the gunmen were suspected to be members of the Tillu gang, Gogi’s rival outfit.That same day, Chief Justice of India NV Ramana had expressed deep concern over the shooting inside the crowded courtroom and advised the Delhi high court chief justice to talk to both police and the Bar associations to ensure that the functioning of the courts is not affected. The matter will next be heard on November 24.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hc-suggests-courtrooms-in-jails-automated-gates-to-enhance-security-101636393500826.html

The PRTC’s tax dues are ₹285 crore and has not been paid for years. More than 90% of its total fleet of 1,113 buses are plying on roads without paying any road tax. Due to non-payment of road tax, the government has also stalled a grant-in-aid of ₹267 crore allocated to PRTC, six months ago.“The department should also taken action against PRTC for defaulting on ₹285 crore in tax. When private buses are not allowed to operate without paying taxes, then why are such privileges being allowed to state undertakings,” a private transporter claimed. Punjab transport minister Raja Warring said it is completely a government affair and understanding between finance and transport department. “The PRTC owes road tax towards government but at the same time, the government is yet to clear pending free-travel dues of the PRTC to the tune of ₹ ₹167 crore. Therefore, it is between two government departments and will be resolved soon,” Warring said. Since taking charge, Warring has tightened the noose against tax defaulters and impounded and challaned over 260 buses due to non-payment of taxes, illegal permits and other documents. Following the action against private players, the department has collected nearly ₹3.65 crore as part of pending government tax.“The corporation has been directed to pay road tax first in order to get allocated grant,” said a PRTC official. Nirmal Singh Dhaliwal, convener of PRTC-linked trade unions, however, said if the government could waive dues of the power corporation and other departments, then it should also follow the same procedure for road tax. “Not only free or concessional travel dues, the Punjab government owes PRTC ₹60 crore for providing free bus service to women,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/prtc-owes-punjab-govt-rs-285-cr-in-road-tax-101636393200751.html
08-11-2021||Lucknow||Woman’s solo effort: Driving change among women, for women||Moving Women (MOWO) Social Initiatives Foundation has launched ‘Moving Boundaries’, a campaign to encourage women to pick up driving skills and remove roadblocks to increase their job prospects.Under this campaign, Jai Bharathi, 39, the founder of MOWO, is touring India on her motorcycle since October 11 for a period of over 40 days, covering over 20 cities, travelling a distance of 11,111 km to create awareness and encourage women to learn driving to increase their job opportunities in the transportation sector, including as taxi and e-rickshaw drivers, or, as delivery agents for e-commerce companies.Bharathi reached Lucknow on the current leg of her tour on Sunday. Starting from Hyderabad, she has covered Bengaluru, Chennai, Kochi, Goa, Pune, Mumbai, Surat, Ahmedabad, Udaipur, Jaipur and New Delhi. Next on her destination itinerary is Varanasi, Patna, Guwahati, Kolkata, Ranchi, Bhubaneshwar, among others.Commenting on ‘Moving Boundaries’, Bharathi said, “Women all over the world face restrictions on their mobility. They are unable to travel long distances to acquire a decent education or take up jobs which involve complex or unsafe commutes which results in a restricted pool of job opportunities.”“I am very excited to take on this 40-day journey on my motorbike across the country to meet women from all strata and hold workshops to make driving an aspirational and achievable employment choice for them. Creating a safe environment where women have access to reliable transportation and they can drive their own vehicles to earn a living, is a great way to increase employment opportunities for women in a sector that has been predominantly male-centric,” the rider said.“The campaign seeks to promote awareness on the importance of women acquiring driving skills and travelling safely to expand their horizons in all aspects of their lives. The focus is on enabling women to not only learn driving but also own electric vehicles to generate income which in turn can also reduce carbon emissions from transport,” she said.As part of the campaign, a WhatsApp-based chatbot has been rolled out for women who would like to learn driving a two or three-wheeler vehicle or apply for a job as taxi, auto or delivery rider. The chatbot will connect them to nearby partner organisations like Even Cargo which offer training and employment opportunities to women. The chat support is available in multiple languages.Shell Foundation, a UK-based charity and the UK government are part of the Moving Boundaries project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/womans-solo-effort-driving-change-among-women-for-women-101636393141804.html

Over 9,500 cases of stubble burning have been reported over the 48 hours leading to 5pm on Monday. In Sangrur, Barnala, Patiala, Ludhiana and adjoining regions, the case count is rising like wildfire. Monday (till 5pm) saw 4,397 cases, with 5,199 instances counted to Sunday. To date, Punjab has seen 42,330 cases, of these 70% have been reported over the past 10 days. “There is major spike in the evening, and number is set to cross above 10,000 over the two days,” said an official, adding that the numbers were similar to those recorded last year. A thick layer of smog has engulfed Malwa. Sangrur recorded 625 farm fires, followed by 580 in Moga, Ferozpur recorded 406, Barnala 332, Ludhiana 398, Patiala 275 farm fires.Highest cases on Nov 8 over 3 years On Monday (November 8), 4,793 cases were reported; the corresponding on the same date for 2020 was 3,453 and 335 in 2019. In terms of area, Patiala recorded an Air Quality Index (AQI) of 337; it was 419 in the morning, which highlights massive farm fires during night hours. Ludhiana recorded 313 AQI, while Jalandhar recorded 314 AQI. An AQI between 300-400 is very poor; with 400-500 severe. “We tried our best to convince farmers, but they are adamant to burn it citing that diesel cost is too high to clear fields using machinery. If you have to stop farm fires, then you have to give some incentive to farmers for handling of paddy straw or provide them platform where they can sell it. This is missing in Punjab, so we see farm fires even as we have distributed bailers, mulchers and other machinery,” said an agricultural department official. He said that wherever the Biomass based power plants are erected, there are minimal farm fires, as such plants buy paddy straw.Farm union leader Balwinder Singh said farmers are burning straw due economic reason as in-situ and ex-situ handling of straw is costly affair. Beside that there is very little window left between harvest of paddy and sowing of wheat, thus burning straw is easiest way to clear field. “If the government wants us to handle straw, we should be paid extra.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/major-spike-in-punjab-farm-fires-10-000-cases-in-two-days-101636392720945.html

08-11-2021||Mumbai||68% of new cases in Maharashtra are from 27 municipal corporations||The urban areas governed by the municipal corporations accounted for 68% of the Covid-19 caseload on Monday. Maharashtra on Monday recorded 751 new Covid-19 cases, of which 511 were from the 27 municipal corporations of the state.Thirteen districts and eight municipal corporations including Malegaon, Nandurbar, Hingoli, Parbhani, Nanded, Yavatmal, Buldhana and Washim recorded zero deaths on Monday, even as 27 districts reported zero deaths in the past 24 hours. Most of the cases have been recorded from Mumbai, Pune, Thane, Kalyan-Dombivli and Pune Chinchwad Municipal Corporations. During the peak of the second wave on April 18, when the cases numbered 68,631, these 27 municipal corporations accounted for 52.47 % of the total cases in Maharashtra, as they numbered 36,017 infections.State surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate attributed the bulk cases on the density of the population. “The urban areas are highly populated and show high density of population, owing to which they are reporting the majority of the cases. However, if we look at the overall picture, we have been able to control the Covid-19 infection rate effectively,” said Dr Awate.Dr Wiqar Shaikh, professor of medicine, Grant Medical College and Sir JJ Hospital, blamed space constraints and the citizens for the high caseload. “It is almost impossible to maintain social distancing in cities. In addition, we are seeing that citizens are not adhering to Covid-19 guidelines as many are not wearing masks and are crowding the markets. Even mass gatherings have started,” said Dr Shaikh.The case tally of the state stood at 6,618,347 on Monday, while the toll touched 140,403. On Monday, 1,555 patients recovered from the infection. The test positivity rate was 1.22%, as 751 positive cases were reported following 61,720 tests.

The regional offices concerned will be responsible for making these ponds and filling them once the festivities are concluded. Offices have to ensure that there is no overcrowding in these artificial structures and all Covid-19 norms are followed."Considering the heavy crowd which generally gathers at seafronts in Mumbai for Chhath Puja, it would be difficult to adhere to the pandemic norms, especially social distancing. Therefore mass gatherings at sea fronts need to be avoided and the police department should ensure that there won't be such gatherings," according to the BMC's revised guidelines.The number of devotees for indoor celebrations has been restricted to 100. On the other hand, a maximum of 200 people can take part in outdoor celebrations."The limit for the open-air ceremonies will be 50 per cent of the capacity but a maximum of 200 people. Similarly, the limit for ceremonies to be held at an indoor office is 50 per cent of the total capacity, but a maximum of 100 people," the guidelines also stated.Only those people who are fully vaccinated are allowed to participate in mass Puja locations and thermal screening have to be installed in such venues.The BMC said that festivities during Chhath Puja have been restricted due to Mumbai registering over 1,700 Covid-19 infections between October 1 till November 6.The city has so far recorded 758,673 cases and 16,281 deaths due to the viral disease. On Monday, the daily tally remained above the 200-mark after 206 infections were recorded while five more patients died.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/amid-fears-of-3rd-wave-mumbai-bans-mass-gatherings-at-seafronts-for-chhath-101636383660453.html

The PMC’s health department has taken the decision in response to a series of complaints about stray dogs intimidating citizens and leading to accidents in various parts of the city as also to augment the sterilisation of stray canines.A health officer of the PMC said, “Animal Welfare Association, Navi Mumbai; and Jivaraksha Animal Welfare Trust are the two organisations selected out of the six tenders we received. They have to set up the infrastructure in their own/private space to pick up the stray dogs in their vehicle/s, sterilise them, vaccinate them and drop them in the same area where they were picked up. They will be paid ₹1,549 per dog.”According to the health department, they have been working on two types of tenders; one where the NGO Canine Control Care works on a ‘no profit, no loss’ basis to ensure that the dogs are sterilised. The NGO works in the Mundhwa, Baner and Naidu areas. A PMC van carrying a volunteer and a person to pick up the dog/s goes to bring in the stray/s for sterilisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-zeroes-in-on-2-organisations-to-sterilise-stray-dogs-101636387380895.html

The civic body announced on Monday that it will set up artificial ponds for puja across the city. Chhath is an ancient Hindu festival dedicated to the sun god, and is primarily celebrated by north Indian communities from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The civic body in a circular issued on Monday, November 8 stated that it will bear the cost of construction and filling up of artificial ponds to be used in the puja one week after the Congress and BJP had made the demand. Last week, a BMC circular stated that citizens celebrating Chhath should avoid beaches. It also said the celebration should be conducted at artificial ponds and that these should be constructed and paid for by private organisers. However, both BJP and Congress demanded that artificial ponds should be set up at BMC’s expense, just like it does for the Ganpati festival and sent letters to or met Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, urging him to direct BMC to set up artificial ponds at its expense. On Monday, the BMC issued a revised circular. “Citizens should prefer going to artificial ponds for celebrating Chhath puja and the BMC administration is hereby directed to set up artificial ponds for the same at its expenditure,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-takes-poll-position-on-chhath-puja-celebrations-101636387319729.html

Chugh claimed that the entire governance in Punjab stood paralysed due to the instability in the CMO, which has been under attack from the PCC president for the past six months.“The Congress high command has been, amusingly, watching the cat fight in Punjab without doing anything even as the working of the constitutional offices has been paralysed,” he said, alleging that the Congress had failed on all fronts in the state under the ‘rule of mafias’. He demanded that during the current assembly session, the Congress government should fulfil its promises made in the election manifesto including that of waiving ₹90,000 crore farmers’ loan, providing jobs to 60 lakh people and providing mobile phones. Chugh said it was unfortunate that instead of passing resolutions for fulfilling promises made in the election manifesto, the Channi government was contemplating passing a resolution against the extension of BSF jurisdiction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/governance-paralysed-due-to-sidhu-channi-infighting-claims-chugh-101636386778936.html
08-11-2021||Mumbai||Five years of demonetisation: Opposition demands apology from Centre||The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition partners have taken a dig at Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi-led Central government on the occasion of the its completion of five years of demonetisation.Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said that the Centre should apologise to the nation for the ‘failure of demonetisation. “In the past five years, terrorism has increased manifold in Kashmir. The circulation of black money has gone up as well. The note ban was a complete failure and an economic disaster. Thousands of people have lost their lives and jobs due to the decision. The Central government must apologise to the nation for demonetisation,” Raut said.“It’s been five years since the demonetisation was announced by Modiji. Nothing has been achieved so far, neither black money came back to the country, nor has corruption dipped. Terrorism too has not reduced. Modiji had asked for three months, now he should tell us which square to come to…” Malik tweeted. He was referring to PM Modi’s address to the people asking for 50 days of hardship, after the demonetisation was announced in November 2016.Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole said, “The demonetisation led to the loss of hundreds of lives, left lakhs of people unemployed and resulted in the dip in the GDP. Nothing that was promised has been achieved from the demonetisation. Modi does not utter a word now about his failed decision.”Nationalist Congress Party leader and state minister Nawab Malik have said that the PM should take responsibility for the failure.BJP has, however, hit back at the ruling parties for undignified remarks against the prime minister. Leader of Opposition in legislative council Pravin Darekar said, “The country has benefited from demonetisation. The tax bracket has widened, bringing unaccounted money under taxation. It has helped in improving the economy. Farmers, women, tribals have been benefitted the most from the decision. The language Malik and others are using for the PM is not appropriate.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/five-years-of-demonetisation-opposition-demands-apology-from-centre-101636386359490.html
08-11-2021||Lucknow||Roadmap for trillion-dollar economy: UP likely to invite bids again to appoint consultant||LUCKNOW The Uttar Pradesh government is soon likely to reinitiate the process of inviting bids for the appointment of a consultant to work out a roadmap to make the state a trillion-dollar economy. There was a question mark over the fate of the process of appointment of consultant following cancellation of bids on technical grounds on March 22, 2021. As the decision to re-invite the bids comes about eight months after the cancellation, questions were also being raised over whether the state government would follow the same timeline of 2020-2025. “We understand a decision to reinitiate the process of bidding has been taken at the highest level. We will float the bids once the decision is communicated to us,” said a senior officer of state government. As more than one and a half year period had already gone by in the processing of floating bids, amending and subsequently cancelling them, there were indications that the timeline to achieve the objective may be amended. “The decision to float the bids has to be comprehensive. We will obviously rework the timelines when we invite the bids again,” said the officer. The state government’s decision to cancel the bids came when it was zeroing down on the selection of the consultant. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had first floated the idea about making the state a trillion-dollar economy. Speaking at the UP Investors Summit-2018, Modi had said Maharashtra too had set a target to become a trillion-dollar economy. “Can Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh compete with each other to become the trillion-dollar economy? Will UP government compete with other states? More the competition, more will be the investment. This will result in creation of more jobs and strengthen the concept of cooperative federalism,” said Modi at the summit on February 21, 2018. Soon, chief minister Yogi Adityanath and his team began working to give some shape to the idea. The state government invited suggestions and held discussions with leading institutions. On June 19, 2020, it floated bids for the appointment of a consultant. The UP government decided to revise the Request for Proposal (RFP) document and the timelines and the bidders were asked to submit their e-bids by October 9, 2020. The revised RFP expected the selected consultant to perform the “Herculean task” of taking the size of UP’s GSDP to trillion dollars. In all, the state government received eight bids. A premier management institute of the country also submitted the bid. Four of the bidders qualified the technical round and their financial bids were opened on November 27, 2020. However, the cancellation of bids was soon announced. “If the state government invites fresh bids to prepare a roadmap to make UP a trillion-dollar economy by 2025, its target will become more difficult to achieve as one a half years of the five-year period have already passed. Moreover, 2021 has not been good for growth of the economy primarily due to Covid-19,” said Professor Yashvir Tyagi, former head of department, economics, Lucknow University.As per the state government’s statistics, UP’s GSDP had been pegged at ₹17.39 lakh crore in 2020-2021. Taking 2020-2021 as the base year, the GSDP will need to grow at about 44% per annum to achieve the target of 1-trillion dollar economy. “This level of increase in the GSDP appears to be beyond the realm of reality,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/roadmap-for-trillion-dollar-economy-up-likely-to-invite-bids-again-to-appoint-consultant-101636385699437.html

Another requisite for the bail is that the accused would not to leave Mumbai without informing the investigating officer and provide itinerary for their travel. In her plea filed in the high court through advocate Kashif Ali Khan Deshmukh, Dhamecha said she was a resident of Madhya Pradesh who had moved to Delhi for work. The plea said Dhamecha does not have any residence in Mumbai, PTI reported. “The above condition imposed will have a drastic effect on her professional life as well as her social life, as she would be required to travel to Mumbai every week,” the plea said, adding that it would be “highly impractical and unworkable” for Dhamecha. Dhamecha has also contended that if the conditions have to be judiciously followed, then she will have to communicate each and every movement to the NCB as she would constantly be shuttling between Madhya Pradesh and Delhi, which is outside the territorial limits of Mumbai. Her plea states that considering she is a resident of Madhya Pradesh and Delhi, there would be no specific itinerary that can be communicated to the investigating officer of the case. Dhamecha has sought relaxation of a bail condition wherein she is required to inform the IO and submit the itinerary. The plea is likely to be taken up for hearing by the high court next week.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/munmun-dhamecha-moves-bombay-hc-seeking-changes-to-bail-conditions-in-drugs-case-101636379730711.html

08-11-2021||Lucknow||‘Aedes aegypti, Albopictus mosquitoes have highest density in Kanpur’s Chakeri’||The teams from the National Malaria Research Institute (NMRI) and the National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD) have found unprecedented density of infected Aedes aegypti and Albopictus mosquitoes in entire Chakeri stretch which is currently plagued with Zika virus infections.The mosquito density could be as high as 1.06 per 10-man hours or the Aedes mosquito or its larvae could be in two-three houses of the total 100 houses, said health officials aware of the findings.Additional director, health, Kanpur division, Dr GK Mishra said the Aedes mosquito had become dominant and its density in Chakeri was a source of worry particularly after the genome sequencing confirmed Zika virus RNA in one of mosquito samples sent to NMRI, Delhi. “It is acknowledgment that mosquitoes in Chakeri are carrying Zika virus,” said chief medical officer, Kanpur, Dr Nepal Singh.During the monsoon, the health department study finds, the density has been 0.93 per 10-man hours. This means the said mosquitoes or their larvae were found in one or more than one- and-a-half houses.Last year the density was 0.660 per 10-man hours or one in 200 houses had Aedes mosquitoes or their larvae, said the officials, adding that it showed the breeding of Aedes mosquitoes had substantially increased in one year.Three years ago, this mosquito was responsible for the worst outbreak of dengue in Kanpur which had recorded around 900 dengue related deaths. The report of malaria control department, Kanpur, seen by HT, says two species of the infected mosquitoes Aedes aegypti and Albopictus have the highest concentration in Kanpur.The malaria-causing Anopheles mosquito has a density of 0.025 per 10-man hours or it has been found in one house of every 400 houses, says the report. While the Culex mosquito that leads to filaria has zero density in urban pockets but 0.012 per 10-man hours in rural Kanpur pockets such as Ghatampur and Sarsaul.Following this finding, the NCDI team has preserved 150 more mosquitos and would collect 100 more in next two days. The mosquitos would be kept in cold and room temperature. CMO Dr Nepal Singh said a test would be conducted for a week to determine the reach of Zika and its effect in Kanpur.After detection of first Zika virus case on October 23, Kanpur has so far reported 89 cases while neighbouring Kannauj district has reported one case, taking the tally total cases in Uttar Pradesh to 90. Zika is a mosquito-borne virus that spreads through the bite of Aedes aegypti mosquito. According to the World Health Organisation, the Aedes mosquitoes usually bite during the day, peaking during early morning and late afternoon or evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/aedes-aegypti-albopictus-mosquitoes-have-highest-density-in-kanpur-s-chakeri-101636385279280.html

In his complaint, Bhoir has said that he had gone to the KDMC office for some work when he saw a replica of the Indian flag near the main entrance to the premises. “The replica had the image of an Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) on one side of the Ashok Chakra in the middle and an image of a human finger with ink on it to denote that the person had cast their vote on the other side,” police inspector Rajendra Ahire, Bazarpeth police station, said. Bhoir subsequently took pictures of the replica and made inquiries, after which he found out that the replica with the artwork had been placed at the spot to raise awareness about the upcoming KDMC elections. The KDMC is currently conducting a special drive to help first time voters to register themselves. Bhoir subsequently submitted the photographs and a written complaint to the police.“I later learned that the replica was removed from the spot after I submitted a complaint. However, this is a gross disrespect towards our national flag and I will not rest till strict action is taken against those responsible,” Bhoir said.On Monday, the police registered a case under the Prevention of Insults To National Honour Act, 1971.“For now, the FIR has been registered against ‘concerned KDMC officials’.

08-11-2021||Mumbai||Railways may reduce AC local train fares||In a bid to increase the ridership of air-conditioned (AC) local trains on the Central and the Western Railway lines, the railway ministry is likely to undertake a reduction in fare prices and introduce more amenities soon.Reduction in fare of the AC local trains along with steps to ‘popularise’ them and restructuring of their routes are some of the measures that are being studied by the Railway Board, the apex body of all zonal railways.The fare structure of the suburban AC local trains will be based on metro fare structure finalised by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) or the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC).Earlier, the Mumbai Rail Vikas Corporation (MRVC) had suggested the fare structure of AC local trains on par with metro fares in Mumbai and Delhi.Chairman of the Railway Board Suneet Sharma who visited the Central and Western Railways on Monday stated that the feedback regarding AC local trains has been received from the zonal railway officials and passengers.“We want to increase the patronage of the AC local trains as the new trains will be coming in both Central and Western Railway lines. The logistics regarding fare structure and routes are being studied and decisions will be taken accordingly,” said Sharma.Further, the railway ministry has plans to convert all local train services to AC local trains in the future.Meanwhile, Sharma inaugurated a locomotive for the Kalka- Shimla railway track at Parel and also inspected the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT), its executive lounge and the newly inaugurated restaurant on wheels at the P’D Mello entrance of the station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/railways-may-reduce-ac-local-train-fares-101636384559798.html
08-11-2021||Mumbai||Kandivli fire: 14th floor flat had many wooden items; cause yet to be ascertained||After the Mumbai Fire Brigade (MFB) recorded eyewitness accounts as a part of its probe into the fire that broke out on Saturday at Hansa Heritage in Kandivli (West), it is now examining the possibility behind the blaze. Earlier, there officials suspected that a diya lit in the balcony set a curtain ablaze in a 14th floor flat and spread to the 15th floor.The fire brigade on Monday came to a conclusion that the blaze spread rapidly throughout the 14th floor flat owing to a large number of wooden furniture and decoration items in the house. The fire brigade also found considerable renovations done to the house and that the flat had medical machinery operating on electricity, as two senior citizens from the family, who lost their lives in the incident, were bedridden. The fire brigade is expected to submit its report in the next few days.Moreover, as seen in the blaze that occurred at Curry Road’s Avighna Park, the firefighting system at Hansa Heritage, too, did not draw water from the tank and was hence non-operational during the operation.“The system at the Kandivli high-rise was being supplied water from an overhead tank. Owing to gravity, water was available in the firefighting system only for the first few minutes after the blaze broke out. Once the pressure ran out, the firefighting system did not work and the blaze was doused using MFB’s machinery,” chief fire officer Hemant Parab said.Parab said, “We learnt that the family had moved in only six months ago. As a part of the renovation, wooden panelling was done and their safety door was also wooden. Moreover, as was the case with the apartment at Avighna Park [where a massive fire had gutted two flats on the 19th floor] there appears to be a false ceiling. Our investigation is ongoing. Now we are looking at other reasons on why the fire could have started.” As per Parab, an eyewitness recalled seeing the lamp dousing off well before the fire broke out. Five members of the family were rescued from the flat. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) issued a statement on Monday reiterating that it is the responsibility of the owner or occupier of the building to ensure fire safety in its premises and that the fire extinguishing system, equipment and alarm system in all the buildings – especially the tallest ones – are operational, in compliance with the Maharashtra Fire Prevention and Life Safety Act, 2006. BMC has warned that action will be taken against buildings if they fail to comply with the norms. The civic body has also warned residents against using flammable material for unnecessary interior decorations work and altering fire protection systems and electrical structures. “In view of the fire accident on October 22 at One Avighna Park and the loss of life and property caused by it, BMC appeals to all concerned to prevent fire-related accidents under section 3(1) of the Maharashtra Fire Prevention and Life Safety Act (sic),” BMC said in a statement.On Monday, BMC reiterated that all occupants or owners of buildings must submit the bi-annual certificate to MFB, following an audit of the firefighting systems of the buildings. The statement said, “Residents living in high-rise buildings should ensure from time to time that fire extinguishers are installed and operational and proper trained manpower are available to handle them. Fire safety drills should also be conducted.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/kandivli-fire-14th-floor-flat-had-many-wooden-items-cause-yet-to-be-ascertained-101636384139222.html

They had been booked on Sunday; they also face a departmental probe now. The accused headconstables, Sukhwinder Singh and Malkiat Singh, and constables, Arpinderjit Singh and Arshdeep Singh, had caught Ranjit Singh, alias Rana, and Jaspal Singh, of Bhitewind village in Amritsar, from Ranjit Avenue area in Amritsar on August 20 this year with 21kg opium. The action against the cops resulted after the accused Ranjit Singh was again arrested by the police last month for drug smuggling. During interrogation, he revealed the August 20 incident to the police; the accused did not even sow the recovered opium on record. The two constables have been arrested, with the headconstables still absconding. On Monday, the constables were presented before a local court in Tarn Taran and remanded to three-day police custody. Police have also applied for the production warrant of Ranjit and Jaspal, with the 21kg opium and ₹40 lakh drug money yet to be recovered. DSP City Barjinder Singh said, “Our teams are working to recover the contraband and the money.” A police source added that the accused cops were likely to be dismissed from service, if found guilty in the departmental probe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/four-tarn-taran-cops-suspended-for-letting-off-two-drug-smugglers-101636383539171.html

The BJP had claimed that scores of Hindu families had left the town after receiving threats from criminals. The claim, however, was contested by others. The alleged exodus from Kairana was a big issue in the 2017 Assembly elections. Yogi Adityanath, along with cabinet ministers Suresh Rana, Sidharth Nath Singh and western UP BJP president Mohit Beniwal, met families of traders allegedly killed by gangsters and those who left the town because of the reign of terror unleashed by gangster Muqeem Kala and others. The meeting with the group of people was held at the house of one Vijay Mittal, whose grandfather Moolchand had left his native place Kairana. “I have sought a report from the district administration about the families which were harmed and their members killed here in the previous Samajwadi Party regime,” Adityanath said, adding that action has been initiated against the guilty. “The government will give some compensation to the victim families so that they could again carry out their business and economic activities,” Adityanath told reporters. He said Kairana was once considered a major industrial town of the country and a centre of classical music. “Towns like Kairana and Kandhla faced repercussions of the criminalisation of politics in the early 1990s and the politicisation of professional criminals. Hindu businessmen and other Hindus were forced to migrate from here on a large scale,” he alleged. “After 2017, due to our government’s policy of zero tolerance towards crime and criminals, many families have returned,” he claimed. Adityanath said when he came to the town in 2017, people had demanded the strengthening of the police outpost and a PAC battalion. “The work of strengthening the outpost has already been done and today I came here for laying the foundation of a PAC battalion camp,” added Yogi Adityanath. The CM insisted that people should stand against anti-social and criminal elements. “These anti-social elements would be exposed only after people rise against them,” he said, assuring the families that the government would initiate stern action against criminals. Briefing the Yogi Adityanath, minister Suresh Rana said that “the law and order situation during the Samajwadi Party’s rule was dismal and members of the victims’ families appreciated the efforts of the BJP government for improving the law and order situation in the town.” “One of them said it was difficult to move out after 5pm during SP rule because criminals were fearless. But the situation has changed now and criminals surrendered in police stations,” added Rana. The families of three traders -- Vinod, Raju and Shankar -- were also invited at Vijay Mittal’s house where they interacted with the CM. Trader Vinod was allegedly killed by the Furqan gang and thereafter Raju and Shankar, were killed by dreaded criminal Mukeem Kala in broad daylight after they refused to pay him extortion money. Killings of three traders in a span of 10 days in 2014 had unleashed a reign of terror in the town, which reportedly led to exodus of many people, said locals. The CM said that the BJP believed in making lives of people peaceful and fearless and construction of a PAC battalion camp in the town would provide them a more secure and safe atmosphere. In June 2016, the then BJP MP Hukum Singh had claimed that close to 350 Hindus had left Kairana over alleged threats and extortion by criminal elements belonging to a particular community. Later, the Kairana police had claimed that a spot verification of 150 addresses revealed several reasons for the migration, including better business and job prospects. Locals said 25 to 30 families who left Kairana town had returned while others were still staying outside. Speaking to mediapersons, Yogi Adityanath said a few families had returned and others would also come back in the changed atmosphere.

The department informed that 5.35 lakh have not taken even a single dose.Thane mayor, Naresh Mhaske, said, “We have started a campaign ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ (knock on each door), wherein health workers, Asha workers and nurses will go to each house to find out how many of them have not taken their doses. They will also immediately vaccinate those residents who have not taken their first dose or are due for the second. We have formed 167 teams for the same.” An awareness campaign will also be taken in Mumbra and Rabodi where the vaccination per cent is low.Mhaske added, “The awareness drives will be held even in schools and colleges through the teachers.

Pramod Sonawane, station duty officer, said, “Our fire official jumped into the well and with the support of a rope, we pulled out the woman. The operation was completed within 10 minutes.”“The woman was admitted to the KEM hospital for a check-up. She had no injuries. Bringing out a living person from a well is more difficult than pulling out a dead body as more precautions need to be taken,” Sonawane said.The fire brigade received a call at 12.11pm and reached the spot soon after at 12.17pm, with the woman being rescued at 12.22pm.“An uncovered well in the wada premises is unsafe. It is a big well and to avoid such mishaps in future, covering it with a net is a must,” Sonawane said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/woman-falls-into-open-somwar-peth-well-rescued-in-10-minutes-101636382580075.html
08-11-2021||Pune||MSRTC flash strike leaves passengers stranded on Monday morning||PUNE For Sharad Nigade, a senior citizen, it was a difficult day as he couldn’t get an ST bus to travel to Kalyan for his pension-related work. So he had to return home and wait till the indefinite strike started by the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) ends. “As last week was Diwali I had planned to go to Kalyan for my pension work and so I came to Swargate ST stand in the morning to catch a bus. Here I came to know about the strike and there were no buses going towards Mumbai. I cannot pay such a high fare for a private bus, as I get a ticket concession on the MSRTC buses being a senior citizen,” said Nigade. Like Nigade, thousands of passengers were disappointed on Monday as they were not able to travel to destinations. Some choose to go by private buses or private cabs. For the last 10 days MSRTC workers and unions are protesting various demands. A Kruti Samiti of unions was formed to have a conversation with the state government. Apparently the main demand of merging the MSRTC into the state government was compromised according to workers, so now all workers (apart from union members) have spontaneously started a strike from Sunday midnight. All 13 MSRTC depots in the Pune division were closed on Monday and no buses went on the roads. It is estimated to be a single-day loss of around ₹60 lakh for the division. Around 120,000 passengers travel daily from the 13 depots. “There are several unions who earlier started the protest for various demands, but when they had a meeting with the state transport minister and other state government officials our main demand of merging the organisation into the government was sidelined. So we are now not supporting any of the unions and have started the strike on our own,” said Sanjay Mundhe, a driver from the Swargate depot. Given that it was Monday morning, a rush of passengers was seen at the Swargate and Shivajinagar ST stands. ST buses from other division depots were also coming in to drop passengers. Another passenger Balasaheb Nikte, who had come along with his wife and three-year-old daughter said, “There is a wedding in our family at Virar and we need to go there urgently. As there are no buses going, we have to look for another option now. I booked the tickets online yesterday for around ₹1,000 and now to travel separately I need to spend double.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/msrtc-flash-strike-leaves-passengers-stranded-on-monday-morning-101636382159040.html
08-11-2021||Lucknow||Those trying to grab govt properties will have to pay for it: Yogi||LUCKNOW In a scathing attack on the Samajwadi Party and its jailed leader Mohammad Azam Khan, chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday said the government’s policy was clear on development and progress of all without any discrimination of caste, creed, or religion but at the same time the government will take stern action “if anyone tries to disrupt festivals, celebrations, peace and harmony.“If people try to grab government properties, they will have to pay for it,” the CM said at an event for inauguration and foundation laying of several projects in Rampur. SP Lok Sabha member from Rampur and nine-time MLA, Azam Khan is in jail since February 2020 and has over 80 cases filed against him including those of land grabbing and criminal intimidation.“In Rampur, the government acted against 147 ‘bhoo mafia’ and freed 640 hectares land from them,” he said, hinting towards Azam Khan. “India is a country of heritage and it is our responsibility to save and conserve the world’s oldest heritage. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the country is moving towards the establishment of ‘Ek Bharat, Shrestha Bharat’ and it is in that series that Article 370 was abrogated in J&K and work towards making a glorious Ram temple in Ayodhya began,” said the CM. He said: “Our festivals too are part of this heritage. But some people do not like it and they had conspired to destroy Rampur’s heritage. And that’s why we had been coming here again and again to protect it and will not let any bhoo mafia (land-grabber) grab properties. Rampur should become part of the overall process of development, better law and order agenda of the state and the central government. In the last 4.5 years, the state government sanctioned projects worth ₹3,000 for Rampur district alone.”Taking a jibe at the SP, Yogi said: “Not only did we treat Covid patients at home and in hospitals, but also those who are in jail. While PM Modi toured the country during Covid, we spent time amid people helping them during Covid. They (SP leaders) stayed in home isolation and did not even care for their own people infected with Covid.” Azam Khan was infected with Covid in jail.Yogi said the state government had also decided to work towards reviving dilapidated sugar mills in the district. “When the government works towards development without discrimination, then people and poor benefit irrespective of caste, creed, or religion,”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/those-trying-to-grab-govt-properties-will-have-to-pay-for-it-yogi-101636381258986.html

While the incident happened on November 4, the family learnt about it only on Sunday after which an FIR was registered and the accused was arrested on Monday.On the day of the incident, the survivor had gone behind her house to collect mud in order to make a ‘fort’ as a tradition of the festival. Even after an hour, the child had not returned and hence her grandparents, with whom she stayed, started looking for her. After sometime, the accused brought the child home saying that he found her fallen near a nullah.“The child was crying throughout and didn’t say anything then. While changing her dress, the grandmother found her bleeding. The grandparents went the next morning to ask the accused what had happened.

In a post on social media, Kolhe said during his days in seclusion, he will take an ‘’overview’’ of some ‘’extreme decisions’’ taken by him. As Kolhe’s post went viral on social media, it fuelled speculations about his next political move. ‘’Time to overview: For last some days, months and year, I ran unconsciously, took some extreme decisions and unexpected steps. But while doing all this, had to do a lot of balancing act, time management and had gone under stress and because of all this, I am now exhausted mentally and physically,’’ the actor-turned-politician wrote in the social media post. Kolhe said meditation and contemplation were needed to get rid of mental stress. ‘’Will have to think about the decisions taken (in the past) and perhaps need rethinking too and for that (I ) am going into seclusion,’’ he said. Kolhe stated that he will remain incommunicado for some time. ‘’We will meet again soon with new elan and energy’’, he added. He also underlined that he was going in for ‘’contemplation’’ and not to a ‘’contemplation camp’’. In the 2019 general elections, Kolhe defeated Shiv sena candidate Shivajirao Adhalrao Patil. Kolhe, who was with Sena before the Lok Sbha elections, had become a household name in Maharashtra by essaying the character of Chhatrapati Sambhaji in a television serial “Swarajyarakshak Sambhaji” and Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj in”Raja Shiv Chhatrapati”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/ncp-mp-amol-kolhe-going-into-seclusion-over-mental-physical-stress-101636380540410.html

08-11-2021||Pune||PM Modi pegs “Sabka Saath-Sabka Vikas-Sabka Vishwas” call on inspiration from wari||PUNE Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said the annual Pandharpur “wari” (pilgrimage) is a symbol of social harmony and equality without any discrimination. It is also an inspiration behind his call for “Sabka Saath-Sabka Vikas-Sabka Vishwas” (everyone’s support, everyone’s development and everyone’s trust), he said. “There is no discrimination in the pilgrimage on the lines of caste. Every pilgrim is equal and lives with the spirit of brothers and sisters. Everyone has one ‘gotra’ that is Vitthal gotra. So when I say Sabka Saath-Sabka Vikas-Sabka Vishwas, it is inspired from the same tradition,” Modi said, after laying the foundation stone for the four-laning of five sections of the Shri Sant Dnyaneshawar Maharaj Palkhi Marg (NH-965) and three sections of the Shri Sant Tukaram Maharaj Palkhi Marg (NH-965G), via a video conference call. The PM said sentiments possessed by warkaris (pilgrims) inspire everyone to work for the development of the nation.About 221km of the Sant Dnyaneshwar Maharaj Palkhi Marg from Diveghat to Mohol, and about 130lm of the Sant Tukaram Maharaj Palkhi Marg from Patas to Tondale–Bondale, will be four laned with dedicated walkways for the palkhis on either side, at estimated costs of ₹ 6,690 crore and ₹4,400 crore respectively. The wari is a pilgrimage undertaken by devotees of Lord Vitthal to his temple in Pandharpur. Palanquins (palkhis) venerating Sant Dnyaneshwar and Sant Tukaram are carried to Pandharpur from Alandi and Dehu in Pune district by the warkaris, who cover the 250km distance on foot. Commenting on women’s participation in the warkari movement, the Prime Minister said women take part in the yatra with the same zeal as men. “This is a reflection of the power of women in the country. Pandhari ki wari symbolises equality of opportunity. Warkari movement considers discrimination inauspicious and this is its great motto,” said the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister said that most warkaris come from the farmer community and these sons of the soil - dharti putras - have kept the Indian tradition and culture alive. “A true annadata unites society and lives in society and lives for society. You are the cause as well as a reflection of society’s progress,” the Prime Minister said.Call to cleanlinessPrime Minister Narendra Modi made an appeal to make Pandharpur the cleanest pilgrimage centre in the country, also inviting villages along the route of the palkhi to plant trees, as it will help the warkaris with shade. After laying the foundation stone and dedicating various National Highway and Road projects to the nation through video conference, the Prime Minister wished for three blessings from the warkaris. “I am appealing everyone to undertake three things for these palkhi routes and pilgrimage centres. First is to start planting the trees along the palkhi route now. When the road work is completed, the trees will also grow and offer respite to warkaris from the scorching sun. Second is to set up drinking water facilities along the walkway. Third is to make Pandharpur the cleanest pilgrimage site in the country,” he said. Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, who also attended the programme, said, “It is good that the central government has undertaken this important project. Maharashtra government will extend its support to all the initiatives.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pm-modi-pegs-sabka-saath-sabka-vikas-sabka-vishwas-call-on-inspiration-from-wari-101636379578659.html

The project was approved in February 2018 with the total project cost being ₹2,550 crore, out of which ₹200 crore was raised by the civic body through bonds. The project involved digging roads, laying down 1,600 km of water pipelines, and installing 35,000 lakh water meters. The actual project work began in December 2018 with 550 km of water pipelines being laid down and 53,000 water meters being installed in different parts of the city till date. While work is still underway in the Kalas, Dhanori, Sahakarnagar, Sadhashiv peth, Bajrirao road, Katraj, Kondhwa, Jambhulwadi, Bibvewadi, Aundh, Balewadi, Pashan and Dhyari areas, the PMC has received complaints of poor reinstatement work from various parts of the city.Aniruddha Pawaskar, chief superintendent engineer of the water supply department of the corporation, said, “We received complaints from citizens as well as our engineers about poor reinstatement work. In the Sahakarnagar area, we gave instructions to the contractor to follow standard procedure and complete reinstatement of the road after laying down the water pipelines. We also instructed the contractor to impose fines for substandard work.”Nandkumar Jagtap, superintendent engineer who is handling the 24x7 water supply project, said, “We are monitoring the work of road reinstatement of the 24x7 water supply project. We have received complaints about uneven road surfaces, rough surfacing, and lack of cement concretisation. Based on the complaints, we have instructed contractors to carry out the work in a proper manner so that people will not face problems.”Earlier too, the PMC had imposed fines of more than one lakh per day for slow work on the water supply project.

Pradeep V G, senior official of L&T, could not be reached for comment despite repeated attempts.The aim of the project is to provide safe and equitable water supply to all citizens for the next 30 years along with 24 hour distribution of water every day; reduction of water losses and non-revenue water; and ensuring of technological, economic and environmental sustainability of the water supply service.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/24x7-water-project-pmc-asks-contractors-to-impose-fines-for-shoddy-road-reinstatement-101636378798999.html
08-11-2021||Chandigarh||Essentials of a lockdown qualified job certificate||The time is not far when applying for jobs, one would be required to submit a lockdown qualified certificate (LQC) that could be self-attested and would have certain parameters with evidence to support one’s claim while being hired. For example, the medical certificate would corroborate your work from home (virtual) and work for home (physical) status. For ascertaining physical parameters, the medical certificate would say Vitamin-D deficient because of no outside exposure; caroused fingers due to doing the dishes, gardening and handyman’s repair work; loss of weight due to no-armchair luxury but standing and moving most of the time while working; fair complexion due to staying indoors; and dark circles due to stress and overwork. Your bandwidth subscription to prove your virtual work from home would be required, besides your use of internet for other jobs such as gaming, using social media, and watching films on Netflix, Prime Video, SoniLIV or Hotstar, to ascertain your claims of adhering to the complete lockdown protocol. They might also need your net banking and Paytm or PayPal transactions, to confirm if you went to the bank to withdraw money, or stayed home getting things online. To find out if you have really worked in the kitchen, an ability test, ‘Smell n’ Tell’, would be conducted to ascertain the claims in your LQC by making you smell and tell various fragrances, perfumes, aromas, smells etc, to confirm if you have been working in the kitchen, and are well aware of the scents of coriander, cumin, ginger, cardamom, carom seeds and fennel besides the smells of garlic and onion. Also, if you are aware of the taste of milk having been overboiled and got a black layer deposited at the bottom of the pan. You must know the curd having gone sour enough to turn your nostril drift to the other side, with a jerk of the neck. Also, you should be able to tell if it’s the right stink of a drainpipe or rotting mangoes. Such sharpness of smell and taste, should confirm your acquired sharpness of working in the kitchen. Well, the CCTV camera installed at your house may help the employer find out your LQC claims of having answered the doorbell yourself to receive couriers. Your Facebook and Instagram updates, compared with your pre-corona times, should not show you in many dresses since you may have to show that your wardrobe hasn’t been used at all for any weddings, parties or gatherings to attend. Speedometers of vehicles registered in your name should confirm they did not move out at all and the last reading recorded with the service station stood there only. Now the most important parameters: If you’ve had your vaccination doses; if your eyes and dental check-up are still pending; if your hair has grown enough not having been to a salon for a hairdo; and lastly, your videos to confirm if you beat thalis, clapped talis, and burnt diyas. rajbirdeswal@hotmail.com The author is a Panchkula-based retired IPS officer, a commentator and an advocate||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/essentials-of-a-lockdown-qualified-job-certificate-101636378318543.html
08-11-2021||Patna||Remember your pledge, says Nitish Kumar in a counterattack on Tejashwi Yadav||PATNA: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, who has been under attack from opposition leaders over deaths due to consumption of spurious liquor in the state, on Monday hit back at them, underlining that it is also the responsibility of the Opposition to ensure implementation of prohibition but they have hardly contributed in this endeavour.“This (checking trade of illicit liquor) was not an individual’s responsibility. It’s for a public cause. All those, who took the pledge to enforce total prohibition should keep a watch on it and play an active role to check the scourge (liquor consumption),” the chief minister said, referring to the 2016 pledge by lawmakers not to consume liquor and encourage people to enforce total prohibition before the government notified Bihar as a dry state.Chief minister Nitish Kumar banned the sale and consumption of liquor in the state in April 2016 when his party, Janata Dal (United) was in alliance with the Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Congress as part of Bihar’s grand alliance. RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav, now leader of opposition in the assembly who has been fronting the opposition attacks over the hooch deaths, was his deputy chief minister till 2017 till the JD (U) exited the alliance and teamed with the Bharatiya Janata Party.Kumar next took a swipe at Tejashwi Yadav on Monday for criticising the government for its failure to check liquor consumption, wondering why the RJD leader only issued statements and didn’t take a concrete step.“Why don’t you (Tejashwi Yadav) come forward and catch those trying to violate the (prohibition) law? Or, they should at least inform the committee, instead of issuing statements to the Press,” the chief minister said. His parting shot came next: It is his (Tejashwi’s) fault that he did not get enlightened despite working with me,” the chief minister told reporters after his Janata Darbar, a weekly programme where people approach him to address their grievances.Nearly 40 people are suspected to have died due to consumption of spurious liquor and about 100 still undergoing treatment over the last week. Most of the cases were reported from six districts; Gopalganj, West Champaran, Siwan, Samastipur, Muzaffarpur and Hajipur.On his part, Nitish Kumar said, he has convened a high-level meeting of ministers and officials on November 16 to analyse how the liquor trade was continuing despite the ban.“Activities of all districts with respect to action taken to check liquor flow will be reviewed. The DGP (director general of police) and the chief secretary have been asked to keep watch on all issues and take action against all those found guilty,” said Kumar. Kumar said a massive awareness drive against liquor consumption will also be planned during the November 16 meeting. In an apparent reference to some BJP leaders nudging the government to review the prohibition law in the context of its effectiveness, Kumar said the ban was enforced after evaluating all aspects. “Initially, it was believed the ban will result in a loss of about ₹5,000 crore to the state exchequer. The next year, the loss came down to ₹1,200-1,300 crore. The same was compensated. However, the ban worked effectively to check violence within the family,” said Kumar.Reiterating the government’s resolve to develop Nalanda University as a premier academic institute in the world, Kumar said the government proposed to offer an additional 70-acre land to the varsity to raise further infrastructure. “The university is surrounded by prime historic locations connected with Both Gaya, Rajgir and Patna. New roads are being built to have faster access to it from Gaya and Patna. An infra-rich medical college and hospital have been made at Pawapuri to cater to the students and visitors to the university,” said the chief minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/remember-your-pledge-says-nitish-kumar-in-a-counterattack-on-tejashwi-yadav-101636377838535.html
08-11-2021||Mumbai||High court asks Nawab Malik to respond to defamation case by Sameer Wankhede’s father||The Bombay high court (HC) on Monday directed the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Nawab Malik to respond to the defamation suit by Dhyandev Wankhede, father of Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) zonal director Sameer Wankhede’s, wherein he has sought ₹1.25 crore in damages from Malik within a day. Though Malik’s advocate informed the court that the suit was served to them on Sunday, the court held that if he (Malik) could respond to the tweets, he should do so in the suit as well.The single-judge vacation bench of justice Madhav Jamdar, while hearing Dhyandev’s suit seeking interim relief in the form of deletion of articles, tweets and interviews from both digital and electronic media, was informed by advocates Arshad Shaikh, Ranjit Agashe, Krishnan Iyer and Saurabh Tamhankar that a temporary injunction was also being sought against Malik and those under his instructions from publishing, writing and speaking on any media. Advocate Shaikh informed the bench that every day Malik was making defamatory statements or posting something or the other against his client and his family members, hence, had moved the defamation suit. Shaikh submitted that on Monday morning Malik had posted a defamatory tweet against the sister-in-law of Wankhede. Referring to the claim by Malik that Wankhede’s father was Dawood Wankhede, Shaikh informed the bench that Wankhede had to clarify that his father was a Hindu and his mother a Muslim, however, such claims were lowering the reputation of his client in the eyes of the public.In October, Malik had come out with a birth certificate purportedly of Wankhede, which showed the father’s name as Dawood Wankhede, however, the claim was refuted by Wankhede and he clarified that his father was a Hindu and his mother a Muslim. The suit states that the tirade by Malik was aimed at Wankhede as Malik’s son-in-law Sameer Khan was arrested by the NCB in January for allegedly trading in contraband. Dhyandev has further stated in the suit that the daily insinuations through press releases and interviews by Malik and his family members were tortious and defamatory and the same had caused irreparable damage, harm and prejudice to him and his family members and loss to their name and societal image too. The suit also claims that Malik calling the Wankhede family fraud and questioning their religious beliefs had also affected the criminal law practice of his lawyer daughter Yasmeen. Senior advocate Atul Damle representing Malik submitted that as the suit was received by his client on Sunday, he did not have any instructions to make a statement to the contentions raised in the suit. Damle further stated that the suit was defective as Dhyandev could not be speaking on behalf of his adult children.After hearing the submissions, the bench directed Malik to file an affidavit in reply to the suit by Tuesday and posted the hearing of the suit to November 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/high-court-asks-nawab-malik-to-respond-to-defamation-case-by-sameer-wankhede-s-father-101636377778603.html

He vowed to make a ghat there and celebrate the festival on November 10.“I think the people of the BJP are frustrated… The L-G took the DDMA decision (to not allow Chhath Puja on the Yamuna banks) and Haryana released water in the river. The L-G belongs to the BJP government (at the Centre) and the party is (also) in power in Haryana," Delhi environment minister Rai told reporters on Monday.Alleging the BJP has nothing to do with Chhath Puja celebrations, Rai said that the party never made arrangements for the festival earlier.Also Read| Delhi: Water supply restored after ammonia spike in Yamuna impacts operationsIn a sharp attack on BJP leader Manoj Tiwari, Gopal Rai also said that Tiwari should speak to his party's government in Haryana about the frothing. "Delhi doesn't release water in the Yamuna, Haryana does," Rai reiterated his point.Earlier, Manoj Tiwari accused the Delhi government of not allowing Puja on the banks of Yamuna as the latter wanted to cover up the frothing due to high pollution.“Arvind Kejriwal has been saying since 2013 that his government will make the Yamuna fit for bathing in five years. Today, Delhi's air and water both are poisonous. They did not allow Chhath celebrations on the Yamuna so that no one can see how poisonous the river has become,” Tiwari told news agency PTI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/haryana-responsible-for-frothing-in-yamuna-gopal-rai-amid-bjp-s-criticism-101636373215091.html

No casualties were reported as the shop was closed at the time and the owner had gone to Anandpur Sahib with his family.Short-circuit is believed to be the reason behind the fire.Owner, Parminder Singh, said the shop is under closed-circuit television camera surveillance and he had remotely assessed the situation through his phone around 4pm. Half-an-hour later, he received a call from his neighbours that a fire had broken out in the shop. The neighbours had also informed the police and fire brigade by then.A JCB machine and battery-operated cutters were used to break open the shutters of the shop, for easing the firefighting operation. Leading fireman Rajan Singh said two fire tenders were pressed into service and the operation lasted for over two hours. The shop owner said, “The incident could have been averted if the shop had been opened on Sunday. We normal keep the shop open till late Sunday afternoon but had closed it as we were going to Anandpur Sahib. But we consider ourselves fortunate that there were no injuries or casualties.”He added that he is yet to calculate the loss, but it is estimated to be around ₹70 lakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-tyre-factory-near-tajpur-road-chowk-gutted-in-fire-no-casualties-101636377238566.html

The committee formed on Monday comprised an additional chief secretary and principal secretary of the finance department, additional chief secretary of the transport department, and managing director of the MSRTC as coordinator, as per the recommendations of the high court. The bench has directed the employees of the unions of MSRTC to forthwith withdraw the strike and resume duties.The vacation bench of justice SJ Kathawalla and justice SP Tavade, while hearing the petition filed by MSRTC, was informed that the petitioner sought an order which would restrain the employees and staffers affiliated to the Sangharsh ST Kamgar Sanghatana from participating in proposed strikes from midnight of November 3.The bench, in its earlier order last week, had restrained the employees and staffers from resorting to striking work, however, as they had breached the order an amicable solution needed to be found to resolve the issue.“Admittedly, the workers of the MSRTC demand that they should be treated as employees of the state government. For this reason, workers of MSRTC, as stated in our earlier orders, are on strike. Though by our earlier orders, we have directed the workers to resume their duties and the order has been breached, an attempt has been made to amicably resolve the above issue raised by the workers by requesting the government to sympathetically consider the demand of the workers of the MSRTC.”The bench then directed the setting up of a high-level committee on Monday to achieve the amicable solution and directed the committee to not only meet the representative of the respondent trade union but all the 28 unions and to complete the exercise within 12 weeks and inform the court of the progress every fortnight. Thereafter the court directed that a report consisting of recommendations by the committee be prepared and placed before the chief minister after which the chief minister should submit his opinion/views to the court. The HC, last week had directed MSRTC employees to refrain from participating in the strikes from midnight of November 3 until further orders as it would cause hardships to travellers who relied on ST buses to go to their hometowns during the Diwali festival season.However, after the court was informed that some employees and staffers had breached the HC order and only 191 of the 250 depots were functional on November 4 which caused inconvenience to passengers the HC had issued notice to a union leader and warned of stern action.After the constitution of the committee on Monday, the bench directed the employees of the unions of MSRTC to forthwith withdraw the strike/agitation and resume their duties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-high-court-directs-msrtc-employees-to-withdraw-strike-high-level-committee-to-resolve-grievance-101636376278630.html

08-11-2021||Lucknow||Yogi visits Kairana, promises relief to people “forced to leave town”||MEERUT Ahead of the UP Assembly elections, chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday visited Kairana in western UP’s Shamli district and promised compensation and security to some families who were allegedly forced to leave the town between 2014 and 2016. The BJP had claimed that scores of Hindu families had left the town after receiving threats from criminals.The claim, however, was contested by others. The alleged exodus from Kairana was a big issue in the 2017 Assembly elections.Yogi Adityanath, along with cabinet ministers Suresh Rana, Sidharth Nath Singh and western UP BJP president Mohit Beniwal, met families of traders allegedly killed by gangsters and those who left the town because of the reign of terror unleashed by gangster Muqeem Kala and others.The meeting with the group of people was held at the house of one Vijay Mittal, whose grandfather Moolchand had left his native place Kairana. “I have sought a report from the district administration about the families which were harmed and their members killed here in the previous Samajwadi Party regime,” Adityanath said, adding that action has been initiated against the guilty.“The government will give some compensation to the victim families so that they could again carry out their business and economic activities,” Adityanath told reporters.He said Kairana was once considered a major industrial town of the country and a centre of classical music. “Towns like Kairana and Kandhla faced repercussions of the criminalisation of politics in the early 1990s and the politicisation of professional criminals. Hindu businessmen and other Hindus were forced to migrate from here on a large scale,” he alleged.“After 2017, due to our government’s policy of zero tolerance towards crime and criminals, many families have returned,” he claimed.Adityanath said when he came to the town in 2017, people had demanded the strengthening of the police outpost and a PAC battalion. “The work of strengthening the outpost has already been done and today I came here for laying the foundation of a PAC battalion camp,” added Yogi Adityanath.The CM insisted that people should stand against anti-social and criminal elements. “These anti-social elements would be exposed only after people rise against them,” he said, assuring the families that the government would initiate stern action against criminals.Briefing the Yogi Adityanath, minister Suresh Rana said that “the law and order situation during the Samajwadi Party’s rule was dismal and members of the victims’ families appreciated the efforts of the BJP government for improving the law and order situation in the town.” “One of them said it was difficult to move out after 5pm during SP rule because criminals were fearless. But the situation has changed now and criminals surrendered in police stations,” added Rana. The families of three traders -- Vinod, Raju and Shankar -- were also invited at Vijay Mittal’s house where they interacted with the CM.Trader Vinod was allegedly killed by the Furqan gang and thereafter Raju and Shankar, were killed by dreaded criminal Mukeem Kala in broad daylight after they refused to pay him extortion money. Killings of three traders in a span of 10 days in 2014 had unleashed a reign of terror in the town, which reportedly led to exodus of many people, said locals. The CM said that the BJP believed in making lives of people peaceful and fearless and construction of a PAC battalion camp in the town would provide them a more secure and safe atmosphere. In June 2016, the then BJP MP Hukum Singh had claimed that close to 350 Hindus had left Kairana over alleged threats and extortion by criminal elements belonging to a particular community. Later, the Kairana police had claimed that a spot verification of 150 addresses revealed several reasons for the migration, including better business and job prospects.Locals said 25 to 30 families who left Kairana town had returned while others were still staying outside. Speaking to mediapersons, Yogi Adityanath said a few families had returned and others would also come back in the changed atmosphere. Yogi also addressed a public meeting in Kairana after laying the foundation stones of a Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) camp and other welfare projects, including construction of a polytechnic, a hospital, worth ₹425 crore.The CM lashed out at the previous governments and accused them of doing nothing for the welfare of people. “They were least bothered about providing even basic amenities to people. During the rule of previous governments, there were no procurement centres for crops and there was shortage of fertilizers,” he said.

It further said that Delhi has at least 2,708 cases of dengue. The national capital also reported 9 deaths due to dengue so far, with three deaths in the previous week.The Centre earlier last week formed teams to assist nine states and Union territories including Delhi, where the dengue caseload is high, and sent high-level teams to support them implement public health measures to control and manage the outbreak.The teams will support states and Union territories to build an effective public health response. The teams will also report to the Centre on the status of vector control, availability of kits and medicines, early detection, availability and use of insecticides, the status of anti-larval and anti-adult vector control measures among other steps.Delhi in October reported nearly 1,200 cases in October alone, the highest number of cases recorded in the month in the last four years, according to official data.

08-11-2021||Lucknow||Mayawati says SP ‘contemptuous of great men born among Dalits and backwards’||Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) supremo Mayawati sharpened her attack on Samajwadi Party (SP) and its leader Akhilesh Yadav on Monday when she alleged that the SP was contemptuous of "great men born among Dalits and backwards" and remarked that the people from these communities should not expect anything from Yadav and his party.She also alleged that the SP-led governments in Uttar Pradesh changed names of many institutions and schemes earlier owing to "hatred" towards backward castes.“Since the beginning, the SP has been contemptuous of the great saints, gurus and great men born among the Dalits and backward. A special example of which is the new Ambedkar Nagar district created out of Faizabad district. They (SP) also opposed making Bhadohi a new district out of Sant Ravidas Nagar and even its name was changed by the SP government,” the former Uttar Pradesh chief minister said in a tweet."Similarly, the names of many institutions and schemes of UP were changed mostly due to casteist hatred. In such a situation, how can their followers expect respect and security from SP no matter how much drama this party does now for the sake of their vote?," Mayawati said in another tweet.The tweet comes after a flurry of BSP lawmakers left the party and switched over to SP, including senior leaders Lalji Verma and Ramachal Rajbhar. Both of them were earlier expelled for "anti-party" activities even as they won from their assembly constituencies in the previous legislative elections.Mayawati had earlier expressed caution that BSP turncoats would weaken the SP. “The SP should know that by taking such selfish party-hoppers, the ticket-seekers within its fold are only going to make its workers angry, many of whom are in touch with the BSP. These people are going to inflict severe damage to the party from inside during the polls,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/mayawati-says-sp-contemptuous-of-great-men-born-among-dalits-and-backwards-101636372800714.html

Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Pankaj Sharma also fined them ₹2.25 crore each while directing that they be taken into custody.“I think it is very hard to reach out to this decision given the complexities involved. After some thinking over some nights and nights, I have come to this conclusion that they deserve punishment,” Sharma said while pronouncing the order.On October 8, the court convicted the Ansal brothers for tampering with evidence.Also Read: SIT arrests prime accused over fake Covid-19 testing scam at MahakumbhThe court also held two of their employees, PP Batra and Anoop Singh, and former court staffer Dinesh Chand Sharma guilty. The Ansal brothers along with Dinesh Sharma, Batra, Har Swaroop Panwar, Singh, and Dharamvir Malhotra were booked in the tempering case. Panwar and Malhotra died during the course of the trial.The court earlier framed charges against seven accused of abetment of offence, causing disappearance of evidence, criminal breach of trust by a public servant, and criminal conspiracy.In the main fire case, the Ansals were convicted and sentenced to two years in jail by the Supreme Court in 2015.The apex court released them as they had already served the jail term on the condition that pay ₹30 crore fine each to be used for building a trauma centre in the national capital.On October 8, while convicting the accused in the tampering case, the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate’s court said, “The manner in which they subjected the process of law to desecration is no less defiling the justice administration system.”It held that their “high handedness” for “securing benefit in the trial sans documents by any means shows the scant regard which they have for the justice delivery system”.“The brazen attitude of the accused is reflective from their conduct as, after the destruction of evidence, they vehemently opposed the prosecution plea for adducing secondary evidence,” the court said.A fire broke out at the Uphaar Cinema in Green Park during the screening of Hindi film Border on June 13, 1997.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/uphaar-fire-ansal-brothers-sent-to-jail-for-7-yrs-for-tampering-with-evidence-101636373578470.html

With 1,171 new cases added to the tally in the week ending November 6, New Delhi’s total caseload has crossed the 2,000-mark.The capital reported 2,708 cases of dengue till November 6.The tally is now inching close to the number of cases in 2018 - 2,798. The toll is inching close to the one in 2017 - 10.In 2015, New Delhi reported the worst dengue outbreak that affected nearly 16,000 people and killed 60.There was only one dengue death in New Delhi last year, two in 2019 and four in 2018, according to official data.Last week, five deaths were added to the tally after an investigation by a death audit committee. The committee received reports of 34 deaths in September and October, of which most were from neighbouring states. Nine of these deaths were still to be investigated by the committee and are likely the ones that have now been added.With dengue cases on the rise, the Delhi government in mid-October made all vector-borne diseases such as dengue, malaria, and chikungunya notifiable, meaning all hospitals, clinics and diagnostic centres have to mandatorily report the cases. This was a long pending decision, with the capital aiming to eliminate malaria in 2022.Delhi government officials said they were using the provisions of new notification to ask hospitals for data on all fever cases along with hospital beds available for them to ascertain the availability of beds and the need for escalation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/new-delhi-sees-three-more-dengue-deaths-toll-reaches-nine-this-year-101636372858398.html
08-11-2021||Chandigarh||Sidhu questions Punjab govt delay in challenging blanket bail to Saini||Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu on Monday questioned the Charanjit Singh Channi government’s failure to file a special leave petition (SLP) in the Supreme Court, challenging the blanket bail granted to former director general of police (DGP) Sumedh Singh Saini by the Punjab and Haryana high court on September 10. Also read: Punjab deputy CM’s son-in-law appointed addl advocate generalReferring to the Behbal Kalan police firing case of 2015 in which two Sikh protesters were killed when they were sitting on dharna seeking action in the sacrilege cases, Sidhu said in Chandigarh, “It has been seven years since, and justice is still awaited.” He referred to Saini as the prime accused in the case and said that with a blanket bail to him, the sacrilege case can’t move forward. Addressing the media after the proceedings of the first day of the two-day special session of the Vidhan Sabha were adjourned to resume on Thursday, Sidhu hit out at the incumbents of the posts of the director general of police (DGP) and advocate general for inaction. The special session has also been called to discuss and decide on the cancellation of power purchase agreements (PPAs) with privately owned thermal plants in the state set up when the SAD-BJP government was in power. On Sunday, the cabinet announced the extension of the session by a day. HC gave six months to complete Kotkapura probe“I’m speaking today because it’s been six months since the high court asked the state to complete investigation into the Kotkapura firing incident of 2015. On April 9, the court had given six months’ time. So far nothing has happened in the matter,” Sidhu said. In Kotkapura also, police fired on the protesters leading to injuries to a number of people, when they were seeking action in the sacrilege cases. Wants report on drug case to be made public Sidhu asked the government to make public the drug case report, which is kept sealed with the high court, in the November 11 sitting of the assembly. “No one stops the government from disclosing facts of the investigations,” he said. Sidhu raised similar issues over micro-blogging site Twitter on Sunday, a day after advocate general APS Deol, in a statement, accused him of obstructing the functioning of the state government and the AG’s office. APS Deol’s appointment remains sticking point The standoff continues between Sidhu and Channi, who took over as chief minister in September 2021 following the resignation of Capt Amarinder Singh, over Deol’s appointment. As a lawyer, Deol represented Saini, who headed the state police at the time of the sacrilege incidents and police firing on protesters seven years ago. Sidhu is opposed to Deol’s appointment for this reason and has been pressing for his removal. He had resigned from his post on September 28 and later indicated the AG’s appointment was one of the reasons he quit. While withdrawing his resignation as Punjab Congress president last week, Sidhu put Deol’s removal as a precondition for resuming his duties. Role of 40 Congress MLAs questioned “Those who sought the removal of Capt Amarinder Singh from the post of chief minister for inaction in the drugs and sacrilege cases are sitting silent now,” Sidhu said, hitting out at a section of ministers in the Charanjit Singh Channi government. He also questioned the role of 40 Congress MLAs after the present dispensation took over, “as they raised a voice seeking Amarinder’s removal and threatened to break into Saini’s house. Why are they not speaking when the present dispensation is not acting, now?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sidhu-questions-punjab-govt-delay-in-challenging-blanket-bail-to-saini-101636371598142.html

Also read: Punjab deputy CM’s son-in-law appointed addl advocate generalBahl had not been allotted the Congress ticket in the 2017 assembly elections from Gurdaspur constituency, which is represented by Brinderjit Singh Pahra at present. Bahl had lost hope of getting the ticket for the 2022 elections. Though he did not cite any reason in the resignation letter, he expressed disappointment over party affairs. “The Congress has almost discarded its ideology and core issues. Traditional Congressmen are getting no space in the party. They have been ignored. On the other hand, people who have come from other parties are placed at the forefront. Naturally, traditional Congressmen will feel suffocated. The influence of money and muscle power has increased,” he said over phone. Bahl said that his family has been in public service for a century. “My grandfather joined public life in the presence of freedom fighter Lala Lajpat Rai. My father represented Gurdaspur four times in the Punjab Vidhan Sabha. People are well aware of our services to the party and I don’t need to explain,” he said. Former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh appointed him as chairman of the Punjab State Subordinate Services Selection Board on March 25, 2018, and a year and a half of his tenure was left. Bahl, the son of former minister Khushal Bahl, is a Gurdaspur-based lawyer. He has been president of the Gurdaspur Municipal Corporation twice and was a Panjab University senate member from 2008-12. He also served as senate member of Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, from 2004-06. At GNDU, he remained a member of the syndicate for a year. He had unsuccessfully contested the 2012 assembly elections from Gurdaspur on a Congress ticket. His father, who died in 2014, was elected MLA from Gurdaspur assembly constituency in 1972, 1977, 1992 and 2002 and remained minister in the governments headed by Giani Zail Singh, Beant Singh, Harcharan Singh Brar and Capt Amarinder Singh. Though he did not disclose his next course of action, sources close to him said he is joining the Aam Aadmi Party in his bastion in the presence of central party leaders from Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jolt-to-punjab-congress-gurdaspur-leader-raman-bahl-to-join-aap-101636370278116.html

We have prepared such plates with the help of folk artists, particularly women artists,” said Pankaj Bhatt, senior superintendent of police, Almora. Aipan is an established folk art from Kumaon in Uttarakhand. It is drawn mainly on special occasions like weddings, festivals and other household ceremonies and rituals. It is said that such an art form on houses bring good fortune and deters evil from entering the houses. Earlier, it was drawn mainly on walls and floors of houses but now it is also drawn on objects of daily use and clothing. Aipan is painted at the entrance of the house, in the courtyard and on the walls of the house. The colour for the art is made from rice flour, geru (brick colour) and other materials used in worship. The art form has great social, religious and cultural importance in the hill state. Bhatt said, “We conceived the idea of using Aipan during the Kumbh fair when we were asked to provide bronze pots decorated with Aipan art by our higher authorities. We thought that if we apply this traditional art on designation plates, it will not only encourage these folk artists but will also give our police stations and offices a Kumaoni cultural look.” “These plates have already been put up at different branches of the police offices and soon they will reach our police stations in the district,” Bhatt said.

08-11-2021||Pune||Monday Musings: In Maharashtra, politicians have broken the Omerta Code||Earlier this week, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) state unit chief Chandrakant Patil suggested to the chief minister to hold an all-party meeting to bring sanity to what he called “vitiated political atmosphere” in Maharashtra. Patil blamed the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) as major contributor to the present crisis. There can be a disagreement on who initiated it. But indeed, Maharashtra’s current political climate is impaired to a point where it is looking beyond repair. In the past, there were occasional aberrations when political slugfest was on display. However, it was often temporary and keeping in mind the political mileage ahead of polls. In normal course, politicians from different hues always safeguarded the interests of each other even if they spoke against rivals in public. It began earlier this year with the February 25 bomb scare outside Antilla, the South Mumbai residence of Reliance chairman Mukesh Ambani. What followed later was the arrest of “encounter specialist” assistant police inspector Sachin Waze, allegations of extortion by shunted Mumbai commissioner of police Param Bir Singh against the then state home minister Anil Deshmukh. Singh is currently in hiding and Deshmukh behind bars. If several Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) ministers and legislators are being investigated for alleged corrupt actions, it only indicates politically charged atmosphere in Maharashtra where party rivals are bringing out fresh “material” each day to accuse each other. Back in 2009, when the then Congress-NCP government tweaked a policy to help sugar barons producing power from bagasse, the opposition BJP was conspicuous by its silence. The sugar factories, mostly being controlled that time by Congress-NCP politicians, successfully pushed ahead their demand of selling electricity in the open market by withdrawing the previous order that mandated these mills to sell 50% of the generated power to state owned power utility. While these factories were getting various kinds of help from government in terms of funds and loans, they were allowed to earn maximum profit. The silence of prominent state BJP leaders, including late Gopinath Munde and Eknath Khadse (who is now with NCP) was conspicuous. But then it indicated how the tweaking is benefiting everyone. Years later, the arrangement seems to have ended, no matter if vendetta is reason for it. Going by what is currently unfolding on the political canvas in Maharashtra suggests politicians have ended an unwritten rule that whatever they may say against each other in public, no one will ever cross the line. There was a time in Maharashtra, harsh political rivals were good friends in personal lives. The tale of Bal Thackeray-Sharad Pawar or Gopinath Munde-Vilasrao Deshmukh friendships may have sounded extraordinary if we were not living in these times. For the MVA constituents - Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress - the current situation may have helped come out of the crisis as it has brought three partners closer. Stitched together after the assembly elections in a set of circumstances unique to Maharashtra’s politics, the MVA government was initially seen floundering as lack of coordinated strategies, weakening authority of the leadership, growing disgruntlement among its constituents and the inability to set a narrative. However, as key members of the cabinet such as deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and Anil Deshmukh, who later had to resign, faced inquiries by the central agencies, the three partners have realised it can be anyone tomorrow, a reason they need to be more united than before. For the BJP, the current political atmosphere may not suit its dream of returning to power once again anytime in the near future. The entry of central agencies has only disturbed the narrative the party was trying to shape in the state in order to portray MVA as example of governance failure. But for common citizens, the situation may hold both – good and bad. With politicians breaking the Code of Omerta, citizens can expect more rot that will help clean the system. However, till the system becomes clean, we will have to face political tamasha, which is affecting the public governance.

08-11-2021||Mumbai||Respond within a day to lawsuit filed by Wankhede’s father, HC tells Malik||The Bombay high court on Monday directed Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik to respond within a day to the ₹1.25 crore defamation suit that Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) officer Sameer Wankhede’s father, Dhyandev Wankhede, has filed against him. The suit has sought deletion of Malik’s articles, tweets, and interviews.Malik has levelled a series of allegations against Sameer Wankhede. He has claimed the officer is a Muslim and used a fake caste certificate to get a government job under the Scheduled Caste category. He tweeted a copy of a birth certificate, which he claimed to be that of the officer and showed his father’s name as Dawood K Wankhede.Dhyandev Wankhede’s lawyer, Arshad Shaikh, told the court that Malik was making defamatory statements and posting something or the other against his client and his family daily and hence the defamation suit has been filed. Shaikh informed the court that the officer had to clarify that his father is a Hindu and his mother was a Muslim. He added Malik’s claims were lowering the reputation of his client. Shaikh submitted that on Monday Malik posted an allegedly defamatory tweet against Sameer Wankhede’s sister-in-law.Also Read: Malik alleges link between Wankhede’s sister-in-law and drugs businessMalik on Monday questioned whether the sister-in-law was involved in the drug business. On Sunday, he alleged Wankhede was part of a plot to “kidnap” actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son, Aryan, for ransom. Aryan was among those arrested following NCB’s raid on a cruise ship last month. Malik called Bharatiya Janata Party worker Mohit Bharatiya, also known as Mohit Kamboj, the “mastermind” of the cruise ship drug raid case. Malik said the NCB’s raid on Goa-bound cruise ship Cordelia on October 2 was “a plot to kidnap Aryan Khan for ransom, of which Mohit Bharatiya Kamboj was the mastermind”. He alleged Kamboj was part of Wankhede’s “private army” which routinely extorted people for money by threatening them. Malik added Wankhede allegedly set a trap for Aryan with the help of Kamboj’s brother-in-law, Rishabh Sachdeva. He added the “private army” will be exposed as the state government has formed a special investigation team to investigate his allegations.In his plea, Dhyandev Wankhede linked Malik’s tirade to his son-in-law Sameer Khan’s arrest in January for allegedly trading in contraband. Malik has maintained Khan was framed and that a court’s order granting him bail vindicated them.The plea said Malik’s claims have also affected the criminal law practice of Dhyandev Wankhede’s daughter, Yasmeen. Dhyandev Wankhede has also sought a temporary injunction against Malik and those under his instructions from publishing, writing, and speaking to any media.Senior advocate Atul Damle, who represented Malik, submitted as the suit was received by his client on Sunday, he did not have any instructions to make a statement. He added the suit is defective as Dhyandev Wankhede could not be speaking on behalf of his adult children.After hearing the submissions, a single-judge vacation bench of Justice Madhav Jamdar directed Malik to file his reply to the suit by Tuesday and scheduled the hearing in the matter for November 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/respond-within-a-day-to-lawsuit-filed-by-wankhede-s-father-hc-tells-malik-101636368237626.html

Earlier, he had warned of strict action against those involved in sale and consumption of liquor in the dry state after the celebrations for Chhath Puja are over.“It is for people to see and judge. If you indulge in such activities, the result is before you. We will take action. Some people are doing bad work by making spurious liquor. Raids are on and I am going to review the entire scenario once the Chhath festival is over,” he had said.Notably, liquor has been prohibited in Bihar since 2016.This comes after at least 20 people died over the past few days from consuming spurious liquor. The incident in which an Army man and a Border Security Force (BSF) personnel are also among the victims, has put Kumar under the radar with the opposition claiming that a nexus exists in Bihar wherein state government officials are also involved.Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader and Bihar’s leader of Opposition Tejashwi Yadav said that the liquor ban is only confined in the words of Kumar. “Instead of taking strict action against the officials, Mafiosi and illegal traders; CM Nitish Kumar keep on cautioning the people from not consuming the liquor,” he alleged, adding that the state police had seized two trucks full of illegal liquor from the school of a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) minister in the cabinet but “no reference” of the person was present in the First Information Report (FIR).Also Read | Bihar liquor deaths: RJD leader says Nitish Kumar govt involved in 'syndicate’Meanwhile, Congress MLC Prem Chandra Mishra pointed out that it was high time the state government re-evaluate the Prohibition Act, and if it is at all effective.The case gained spotlight after it was reported on November 4 with a total of 10 fatalities in Bihar’s West Champaran and Gopalganj districts. As of now, at least 20 people have died in both the districts and police have said that they are awaiting a post-mortem report to reach any conclusion. “Prima facie, these deaths appear to have occurred due to the consumption of poisonous substances,” West Champaran’s superintendent of police Upendra Nath Verman said.A station house officer (SHO) Manish Kumar and one chowkidar have been suspended in the matter so far. Also, four persons, including two women have been held and five others have been detained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/nitish-kumar-calls-high-level-meet-on-nov-16-over-liquor-ban-in-state-101636366802335.html

The BJP threatened that it would force chief minister Mamata Banerjee to reduce VAT on fuel prices.The BJP had earlier announced that it would take out rallies in West Bengal for five days starting Monday, demanding a reduction in VAT. On Monday, BJP leaders clashed with police in Kolkata after the party workers were stopped from proceeding. Several leaders and workers of the opposition party in West Bengal were detained during the clashes, a police officer told news agency PTI.Also Read| ‘Will ask Mamata to reduce tax if…’: TMC leader counters BJP on petrol prices“We’ll force chief minister Banerjee to reduce the VAT. Police might try to stop us but we’ll fight them,” state BJP chief Sukanta Majumdar said, adding that the TMC government stopped the BJP rally because they were "afraid."Echoing Majumdar's remarks, the leader of opposition in Bengal Suvendu Adhikari said that rallies will be held at any cost.Pointing out that the TMC's double standards have been exposed, Adhikari, a former protege of Mamata Banerjee told PTI, “Not just the Centre, several other states have slashed taxes to bring down the fuel prices, but the TMC government which pretends to be pro-people is yet to do the same.”BJP leader Dilip Ghosh also hit out at the TMC by saying that the latter was most worried about the surge in fuel prices, but now it did not even issue any response in this regard. “Reduce the VAT if you (TMC) are so concerned about people's problems,” Ghosh said.On the eve of Diwali, the Centre announced a reduction in central levies on petrol by ₹5 a litre and diesel by ₹10 a litre, which was seen as a major relief for consumers amid the spike in fuel prices. Till now, over 20 states and Union territories have undertaken a commensurate reduction of VAT.However, several opposition-ruled states including West Bengal, Delhi and Maharashtra among others have not reduced VAT.Also Read| BJP questions Opposition ruled states for not cutting excise on fuel pricesIn Bengal, the ruling TMC accused the Centre of indulging in cheap politics over fuel tax as its inertia in stemming the skyrocketing prices of petrol, diesel and LPG had been exposed.

08-11-2021||Delhi||Smog mode on: From kadha to humidifiers, Delhiites combat pollution||The days after Diwali are always followed by ones engulfed in heavy smog and pollution and this year is no different with air quality deteriorating to ‘severe’ category. Despite a blanket ban on firecrackers, there were many areas in the city where firecrackers were burst and this as well as the fumes from farm fires have created havoc in the Capital, making the air quality hazardous. From sipping on kadha’s and ashwaghandha, using essential oils and humidifiers, to even moving out momentarily, delhiites have their own checklist to protect themselves from city’s poor air quality. ‘Finding it difficult to breath’“It’s very sad to see that despite multiple warnings, Delhites did not pay attention to the pollution warning. It just goes on to say how insensitive we have become. The air quality was already bad before Diwali and now it is worse. I woke up 6am on the next morning of Diwali, finding it difficult to breath. With God’s grace, I do not have any respiratory problems, imagine what people with respiratory issues must be going through,” says Neha Mehra, a teacher from Mayur Vihar.‘Stocked up on kadha’Well, Delhiites have resorted to home remedies to help themselves stay fit and healthy during this time. “I was anticipating that the pollution levels will go up after Diwali. Winters are literally deadly for me because of this. I have trouble breathing normally for weeks. So I am making sure to have the humidifier on all the time. Besides this, I had already stocked up on kadha, and I am having a cup of that everyday. I am also steaming with essential oils and have kept air purifier plants at home too. I have sinusitis so nothing works apart from antiallergic but I still believe in building immunity with natural ways,” says Harsha Yadav Malik, a consultant who works at an IT firm in New Rajinder Nagar.‘Wearing N 95 masks’Neha Singh, a senior manager from IP extension, says, “The smog situation in Delhi is bad and we have already started consulting a nutritionist to make sure that we are taking in the right nutrients to remain healthy. She has suggested us to have a drink with Ashwagandha in it every day and we are following this. Besides this, we are making sure to wear N 95 masks, because, besides protecting us from Covid, these also protect us from the smog. And also, we are only going out when absolutely required.”‘Can’t stay in Delhi’And some are even leaving the city! Anshu Aanand, an HR professional, Sarvodaya Enclave says, “My in-laws live near Nainital and we will be going to live with them for a while. We can’t be staying here in Delhi with the pollution, it’s crazy. On Diwali, there were so many crackers and seven-month-old was so scared and she kept crying. She didn’t know what was happening and she was not being able to sleep also at night. We cannot even take her out now because of the pollution.”Author tweets @anjuriFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/smog-mode-on-from-kadha-to-humidifiers-delhiites-combat-pollution-101636358936382.html
08-11-2021||Mumbai||Was your kin involved in drugs biz: Nawab Malik asks Sameer Wankhede||Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik launched a fresh attack on Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) Mumbai zonal director Sameer Wankhede on Monday when he asked if the officer’s sister-in-law was involved in “drug business” and shared screenshots of a case pending against her in a Pune court.In a tweet on Monday Malik shared screenshots of a 2008 case registered under Section 3458 of the Prevention of Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act in which Harshada Dinanath Redkar was shown listed as “respondent and advocate” along with two other persons.The screenshots were from ECourts Services, a government portal which lists the cases before the sessions courts, city civil courts, and the magistrate courts across the country.“Sameer Dawood Wankhede, is your sister-in-law Harshada Dinanath Redkar involved in the drug business? You must answer because her case is pending before the Pune court. Here is the proof,” Malik tweeted.The regular criminal case is before the Judicial Magistrate First Class (JMFC) in Pune. The first hearing, according to the website was held on February 18, 2008. The next date of hearing is listed as March 18, 2022. The state of Maharashtra is listed as the petitioner in the case, which indicates that the state has filed a regular criminal case against the three respondents.Wankhede’s wife Kranti Redkar responded to Malik’s tweet stating that her husband had no relation to the case and that the matter was sub-judice.“I know you have lot of questions regarding a tweet Mr Nawab Malik has put on his Twitter handle. I would like to say that my sister was and continues to be a victim in this case. According to our legal team, it is not prudent to comment as the matter is sub-judice. My sister is going to tackle Mr Malik’s tweet legally. Shri Sameer Wankhede has no relation to this case whatsoever,” Kranti said in a tweet on Monday.Wankhede said that was in inducted into the Indian Revenue Service (IRS) in 2008, and only married Kranti, Harshada’s sister, in 2017.The Bombay high court on Monday directed Malik to submit an affidavit in response to a defamation suit filed by Wankhede’s father, Dnyandev and posted the matter for hearing on November 10.Separately, the metropolitan magistrate’s court on Monday issued notice to Malik on a criminal defamation complaint filed by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) functionary Mohit Kamboj. The court noted that prima facie Malik’s statements harmed the complainant’s reputation.In the past month Malik, a state minister from the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) has levelled serious allegations against Wankhede and the NCB over discrepancies in the investigation of a drug raid, led by Wankhede, on a cruise ship on October 2, which led to the arrest of 20 persons, including Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son, Aryan (23). Last month, Malik claimed that Wankhede had forged a caste certificate to get a position in the IRS as a candidate from the Scheduled Caste (SC) category. He also claimed that the Wankhedes were Muslim, and shared photos of Sameer Wankhede’s first wedding which was conducted as a ‘Nikah’ ceremony. Wankhede and Dnyandev, a former police officer, denied the allegations.On Sunday, Malik held a press conference during which he claimed that Wankhede was part of a plot to kidnap Aryan for ransom, along with Kamboj (also known as Mohit Bharatiya). Malik claimed that Kamboj and Wankhede came up with the plot with the help of Kamboj’s brother-in-law, Rishab Sachdeva. Kamboj filed a defamation complaint on October 26 in which he stated that Malik had “purposefully and intentionally defamed” him and his brother-in-law Rishab Sachdeva during a press conference held on October 9.Dnyandev filed a ₹1.25 crore civil defamation suit against Wankhede on Sunday and sought a permanent injunction restraining Malik and others “acting under his instructions” from publishing, writing or speaking in the media about the family.On Saturday, Kamboj had held a press conference claiming that an NCP worker named Sunil Patil was the “mastermind” behind the drug raid on October 2. The following day, Malik levelled a similar accusation against Kamboj and claimed that the latter was part of Wankhede’s “private army” which regularly extorted money from people. He said that the raid was “fake”.Malik has also questioned the presence of Kiran Gosavi –who has several cheating cases against him – as well as BJP office-bearer Manish Bhanushali as independent witnesses in the drug raid case. The raid on the cruise ship Cordelia led to the recovery of 13 grams of cocaine, 5 grams of Mephedrone, 21 grams of Charas, and 22 pills of MDMA (ecstasy) and a sum of ₹1.33 lakh. Aryan’s friend, Arbaaz Merchant was found carrying 6 grams of charas in a plastic pouch tucked away in his shoe.Most of the 20 persons arrested, including Aryan and Merchant, are out on bail.Maharashtra textiles minister Aslam Shaikh on Monday clarified that he too was invited to the cruise party by Fashion TV head Kashiff Khan, but that he did not know him personally. Shaikh was responding to the remarks made by Malik on Sunday who claimed that Shaikh, Mumbai’s guardian minister was invited by Khan, who “insisted” he join the party. Malik said on Sunday that there was a conspiracy to frame Shaikh and children of political leaders from the ruling party in a bid to defame the government. “I was invited by Kashiff, but I do not know him. He didn’t speak to me nor have I spoken to him. I do get invitations for many events as the guardian minister, this was one of them. Even as a port minister, I did not have any information about the party. I would have informed the police had I got it. The permission to the cruise was not given by department. It is the prerogative of the Centre,” Shaikh said. “There have been attempt to destabilise the state government since its formation. I do not know if there was any attempt through this particular case. If it was so, it will come to the fore in the investigation that is underway. The Aryan Khan case is being blown up on a large scale but nobody is talking about the ₹20,000-crore drugs seized from a Gujarat port [Mundra, in September]. Secondly, BJP leaders in the state have been speaking in favour of NCB and are shielding the agency against the allegations levelled against it. Why should any political party defend any agency?” Shaikh asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/malik-alleges-link-between-wankhede-s-sister-in-law-and-drugs-business-101636358816379.html
08-11-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab Police team interrogates dera head in Rohtak jail||A special investigation team (SIT) of Punjab Police arrived at Rohtak’s Sunaria Jail on Monday morning to interrogate Dera Sacha Sauda head Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh for his alleged role in the theft of a ‘bir (copy of Guru Granth Sahib)’ from a gurdwara at Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village in Faridkot district on June 1, 2015.Also read: Day 1 of two-day special Punjab assembly session adjourned after obit referencesA jail official, requesting anonymity, said four members of the SIT, led by inspector general Surinder Pal Singh Parmar along with senior superintendent of police MS Bhullar, deputy superintendent of police Lakhvir Singh and inspector Dalbir Singh reached the Sunaria jail premises at 9.45am. “The SIT has prepared a list of questions for Gurmeet Ram Rahim and they will interrogate him. It depends upon the SIT and the accused how long the interrogation process runs,” the jail official said. Gurmeet Ram Rahim has been lodged in the jail since August 25, 2017, when he was convicted for raping two women followers and sentenced to 20 years in jail. He was later convicted of the murders of journalist Ram Chander Chhatrapati and Ranjit Singh, a former dera manager, in which he has got a life sentence. Security stepped up at jail Security arrangements were beefed up at the Sunaria jail premises and only vehicles with prior permission were allowed to enter the premises. SIT head Surinder Pal Singh Parmar had sent a communication to Rohtak deputy commissioner Manoj Sheoran, informing that on the direction of the Punjab and Haryana high court, the members of the SIT will visit the jail for interrogating Ram Rahim on November 8. A Faridkot court in Punjab had issued production warrants against Ram Rahim in the case of sacrilege at Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village but the Punjab and Haryana high court directed Punjab Police to interrogate Ram Rahim in Rohtak jail itself, if it so desired, and directed the jail authorities to make arrangements for the SIT to question the dera head. In July 2020, after the arrest of seven dera followers, the SIT led by former inspector general of police Ranbir Singh Khatra, had named Ram Rahim and three national committee members of the dera, Sandeep Bareta, Pardeep Kler and Harsh Dhuri, as accused in the case. ‘Instigated by dera chief to avenge insult to sect’ The ‘bir’ was stolen from Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village gurdwara on June 1, 2015. On October 12, 2015, torn pages of that ‘bir’ were found scattered in front of a gurdwara in the adjoining Bargari village, leading to statewide protests and death of two Sikh protesters in police firing.

Addressing a press conference in Chandigarh, the cricketer-turned politician also remarked that not filing the SLP was a ‘delaying tactic’ by the ruling dispensation. Also Read | Punjab: HC stays all probes against ex-DGP Saini till Feb 2022“The courts cannot be blamed for the delay as they act only upon the investigation report put up by the police,” Sidhu said, as he continued his attack on party colleague and new chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, with whom he has engaged in a war of words in recent days over investigations into the 2015 sacrilege cases.Also Read | Sacrilege probe on right, fast track, Channi’s retort to SidhuThe Punjab and Haryana high court, on September 10, granted blanket bail to former Punjab Police DGP Saini, in connection with various criminal cases registered against him. As per the court's directions, the former police officer cannot be arrested till February 2022, when the northern state is likely to go to polls.Saini was the head of the police force when incidents of sacrilege were reported from across Punjab, in October 2015. With protesters taking to the streets, the police opened fire in Kotkapura and Behbal Kalan, resulting in the deaths of two agitators. However, the high court's order will also stall probe against Saini in sacrilege violence cases, among others, giving him more relief.Sidhu had repeatedly targeted former Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh, whose resignation in September paved the way for Channi's elevation, over investigations into the sacrilege episode; Singh resigned from the Congress on November 2, and announced his own political outfit. Sidhu, meanwhile, has shifted his attention towards new advocate general of Punjab, APS Deol, and new DGP, Iqbal Singh Sahota, over their respective roles in the probe. Deol, in fact, represented Saini in the high court, which eventually granted the latter protection from arrest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/why-no-slp-filed-sidhu-questions-punjab-govt-over-blanket-bail-to-ex-dgp-saini-101636353873301.html

08-11-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra continues to see decline in Covid-19 cases over the past week||While Maharashtra has seen a decline in the number of new Covid-19 cases over the past week, the number of daily tests carried out for the coronavirus disease has fallen as well, dropping to an average of 81,842 during the last seven days from 110,502 the previous week.The Covid-19 positivity rate has risen to 1.14% from 1.11% during the past week, but only marginally.On Sunday, Maharashtra recorded 892 new Covid-19 cases and 16 new deaths. The state’s overall tally has touched 6,617,654 infections and 140,388 Covid-related deaths. Mumbai recorded 252 new cases and three new fatalities.Also Read: Govt offices to resume biometric attendance from todayA total of 65,716 tests were done on Sunday across the state, while the number of recoveries clocked 1,063. Active cases in Maharashtra dropped to 14,526, with Mumbai leading with 3,715, followed by Pune (3,047) and Ahmednagar (2,170).The decline in cases and tests was due to the Diwali season, during which fewer people undertook testing and some sections of the health authorities treated the spell as a holiday season, according to an official from the health department.Medical experts believe cases are generally declining because a large number of people were already exposed to the Covid-19 virus. “There is an agent and susceptible hosts that drive an epidemic,” said epidemiologist Dr Jayaprakash Muliyil. “When the number of susceptible hosts comes down, the cases automatically show a decline. The natural form of infection induces robust immunity for a long time. A large percentage of the population has already gained immunity because of the exposure to the virus,” he said. While fears of a new coronavirus variant persist, Dr Muliyil said the country has already been exposed to different variants. “We should be fine until a new variant, which uses a completely new receptor site, comes up. I don’t think that will happen soon. The lower test positivity rate, despite a decline in the number of tests, can also be considered as a positive sign. If the positivity rate is low, it still means that the infection is less. Had the spread of infection been higher, the positivity rate would have been higher,” he said. The number of cases in the first week of November saw a decline, compared to the two previous weeks. The first week of November reported 6,576 Covid-19 cases with an average daily caseload of 939.The number of daily tests has fallen in the past one week as 572,895 tests were conducted with a daily average of 81,842. The positivity rate during this period was 1.14 %. Against this, the previous week, from October 25-31, 773,516 tests were done with a daily average of 110,502. A total of 8,633 cases, with a daily average of 1,233 and a test positivity rate of 1.11%, were recorded during this period.The first week of October witnessed 18,477 Covid-19 cases with a daily average of 2,639 cases. The week reported 966,983 coronavirus tests with a daily average of 138,140 tests. The positivity rate during the period was high at 1.99%.However, September and October reported a high positivity rate at 1.8% and 1.53%, respectively.State surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate said the positivity rate has been decreasing over time. “We have been controlling the virus and this is aptly seen through the decline of new cases, deaths and positivity rates. Authorities have been focusing on areas with a high number of patients and deaths, and providing timely isolation and medication to them.” Dr Ishwar Gilada, secretary-general of Organised Medicine Academic Guild said the overall situation improved significantly. “The overall numbers along with positivity rates have declined significantly. In the majority of the districts [in Maharashtra], there are fewer cases, while in urban pockets such as in Mumbai and Pune, we see more numbers pushing the state tally up. The large-scale vaccination has done magic for overall improvement of the situation,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid19-pandemic-maharashtra-continues-to-see-decline-in-coronavirus-cases-101636345014825.html

On October 29, several activists of right-wing groups were detained after they protested at a designated prayer site in Sector 12 of the Millennium City. Later, Muslim leaders decided to withdraw performing ‘namaz’ in open spaces to avoid any confrontation and submitted a memorandum to the administration in this regard. Last week, on the occasion of ‘Govardhan’ puja, some Hindu groups organised rituals at the same site, where protests had taken place, which was also attended by Delhi BJP leader Kapil Mishra. ‘Farmers don’t want to talk’As the ongoing farmers’ agitation on the Delhi borders complete almost a year and the impasse over the contentious three farm laws continues, SKM leader Rakesh Tikait has given an ultimatum to the central government to repeal the laws by November 26 or the protests will be intensified. On this, Vij claimed that the government has invited farmers for talks several times, but “they don’t want to engage in a conversation due to some unknown reasons”. Haryana has turned into an epicentre of the farmers’ stir with two out of three primary protest sites on the Delhi borders fall in the Haryana territory. Leaders of the ruling BJP-JJP alliance are already facing wrath of the protesters at every public event they attend, even in their own constituency.

08-11-2021||Delhi||Air quality another concern as children return to school||As more schools in Delhi reopen for in-person classes after the Diwali break, they will have to contend with hazardous pollution levels in the city, a concern schools said took a backseat as Covid-mitigation measures became their primary focus.Most heads of school said they will limit outdoor physical activity till the air quality improves.Jyoti Arora, principal of Mount Abu Public School in Rohini, which reopens for in-person classes on Thursday, said, “As pollution peaks, especially after Diwali, we abort outdoor physical activity and will continue to do the same once we reopen. We have already outlined in our operating guidelines that there will be limitations on some sports and outdoor activities due to prevailing concerns around Covid-19 and pollution levels.”So far, around 70% of the students’ parents in the school have consented to let their children attend physical classes, authorities of the institution said. Most students, however, have declined to opt for the school’s transport services, likely due to the fear of Covid-19 spreading.“We are still in the process of obtaining parents’ consent. Some parents are still weighing the options, due to which responses are arriving slowly. It is possible that the pollution levels may be one of the factors due to which parents are taking their time to consent to physical classes,” said Arora.For the first few days after reopening, the school will focus on interactive sessions with students on a range of topics, including the Covid-19 pandemic and climate change.“Teachers will have detailed discussions with children on mental and physical health, climate change, and other concerns so that there is meaningful dialogue,” said Arora.Tania Joshi, principal of The Indian School, said that the institution will limit outdoor activity and hold shorter classes.“We will have classes for between three and three-and-a-half hours, so pollution shouldn’t play a major role right now. Parents are already a little apprehensive due to Covid-19, so I’d say that pollution is among the factors [we are considering]. Due to the pandemic, pollution has taken a backseat in comparison to pre-Covid times,” said Joshi.Government schools also said they will keep physical activities to a minimum.AK Jha, principal of the Government Co-ed Sarvodaya Vidyalaya, Rohini, said that while pollution was prevalent, it may not majorly impact attendance this year.“I think children will continue to visit school, especially at a time when classes have resumed after a long gap,” said Jha.He said that students had been directed to wear full-sleeved shirts and consume ‘amla’ every day. “Every year, I advise children to consume amla, so that they can stay healthy as pollution levels peak,” said Jha.M Shariq, principal of the School of Specialized Excellence in Kalkaji, said a large number of students may join classes once the Chhath festivities end on November 10. He also said that games and other outdoor activities will not take place in the institution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/air-quality-another-concern-as-children-return-to-school-101636318965333.html

08-11-2021||Chandigarh||MBBS seat sale: Jammu and Kashmir police seeks sanction to prosecute Hurriyat leader, 8 more||The Jammu and Kashmir Police have moved the home department for granting sanction for prosecution against nine people, including a leader of a Hurriyat constituent and an advocate from south Kashmir, in a case related to “selling” of MBBS seats in Pakistan to Kashmiri students and using the money to support and fund terrorism, officials said on Sunday. The case was registered by the Counter Intelligence Kashmir (CIK), a branch of the police’s CID, in July last year after receiving information through reliable sources that several unscrupulous persons, including some Hurriyat leaders, were hand in glove with some educational consultancies and were “selling” Pakistan-based MBBS seats and seats in other professional courses in many colleges and universities. At least four people were arrested by the CIK in August and it also named two of their accomplices who are at present in Pakistan and its occupied Kashmir areas. The CIK, after a thorough investigation, moved the Jammu and Kashmir home department and sought sanction for prosecution against the nine people under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), mandated according to the act. According to the officials, more evidence has surfaced during the probe in which it was also found that the money gathered from admissions had been passed on to some terror groups as well as secessionist groups for promoting enmity and waging war against the country. Significantly, the case could come in handy in carrying out with the provisions of banning hardline Hurriyat Conference as the chief of one of its constituents -- Mohammad Akbar Bhat alias Zaffar Bhat of the Salvation Front -- is among the nine against whom the sanction has been sought under the stringent UAPA. Some of the witnesses examined have indicated that many families approached Hurriyat leaders to avail the “programme”, a brainchild of Pakistan’s external snooping agency ISI, aimed at incentivising terrorism by compensating the family of killed terrorists by way of providing free of cost MBBS and engineering seats, the officials said. However, there have been instances where such families were disappointed as monetary consideration was given precedence over the intended objective of the “programme” run by the ISI, they said. The officials said that cost of seats ranged between ₹10 to ₹12 lakhs and in “some cases, the price was brought down on ‘sifarish’ (recommendation) of senior Hurriyat leaders, and depending upon the political heft of these secessionist leader, who intervened, concessions were extended to the aspiring student and his family”. CIK sleuths cracked the whip in August and arrested Bhat and three others for “selling” MBBS seats in Pakistan to Kashmiri students and using the money to support and fund terrorism. During the probe, it surfaced that MBBS and other professional degree related seats in many cases were preferentially given to those students who were close to family members or relatives of killed terrorists. There were also cases where the quota allotted to individual Hurriyat leaders were sold to anxious parents who wished their children to have MBBS and other professional degrees in one way or the other. More than 80 cases were studied in which either the students or their parents were examined for academic years between 2014-18. Searches were undertaken in about a dozen premises in the Kashmir Valley. The officials said that Bhat’s brother Altaf Ahmad Bhat and another arrested person’s brother Manzoor Ahmad Shah, were coordinating from across the border and facilitating the admissions. The two, who have been named accused in the case, had exfiltrated to Pakistan during the early 1990s for arms and ammunition training and have settled down on the other side. They played a key role on behalf of the ISI in facilitating matters pertaining to admissions under this category for this set of Hurriyat-linked persons in India as part of a nefarious design of pumping money into militancy and other terrorist related activities. -- PTI||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mbbs-seat-sale-jammu-and-kashmir-police-seeks-sanction-to-prosecute-hurriyat-leader-8-more-101636316871158.html

08-11-2021||Chandigarh||Saffron bloom in Kashmir raises hopes of good harvest||Saffron bloom this autumn has again raised the hopes of a good harvest for the second consecutive year.According to officials, this year’s harvest is going to break all previous records of production. From the past two weeks, in the early hours, villagers assemble at the fields of Pampore to pluck purple-coloured flowers and the harvest gives them the hope of a bumper crop. “If everything works, this year will break all previous records and the production will surpass previous years of the saffron production,” said director, agriculture, Iqbal Choudhary. “After the compilation of the figures, the production will be much above this year,” he said.He said though the figures were compiled by the end of December, they get an idea by the harvest which had almost been completed.Harvesting began in October-end and will continue till the middle of November. And from the past couple of weeks, the meadows of Pampore on both sides of the National Highway IA wore a festive look on sunny days with families thronging to their fields to collect saffron in wicker baskets.“The almighty has been kind to us this season like last year. Though when there were predictions of snow in the last week of October, everyone got worried and were thinking that snow could prove disastrous at the peak harvest season. Fortunately, there was only rain, not snow,” said Manzoor Magray, a grower from Lethpora who has almost completed his harvest on an acre of land. “We almost completed our harvest. Now we will be drying the flowers for the final processing,” he said.Another grower Asif Javeed said most of the saffron growers had already completed their harvest in Pulwama. Within the next few days, the plucking of flowers will be over.Last year Kashmir’s saffron output crossed 13.36 tonnes, the most in a decade, thanks to the introduction of a scheme in 2010 to rejuvenate its cultivation and the launch of sprinkler irrigation. Saffron is reputed to be the world’s most expensive spice and is known as the king of condiments. It fetches between ₹1.5 lakh and ₹2.5 lakh per kg. The national mission on saffron was launched in 2010 under which root rejuvenation of the crop and sprinkler irrigation were launched.Officials claim that saffron yield in the area where the scheme was implemented had increased to 4.5 to 5 kg per hectare and Kashmir has the potential to produce 6 to 7 kg saffron per hectare. Earlier, in the 1980s, our production was over 6 kg per hectare.Officials said saffron was grown across 3,700 hectares in Kashmir compared to 5,500 hectares in the late 1980s. The ₹410-crore national mission on saffron has been implemented on 3,500 hectares. Of this, 3,200 hectares is located in Pampore and the rest in Srinagar and Budgam.The officials said the mission had helped bring more land under the saffron cultivation. Many growers had earlier started converting saffron fields into apple orchards and using them for commercial purposes because of their prime locations, mostly along the Srinagar-Jammu highway. With bumper production continuously, the growers will be again get motivated towards this golden crop. “We feel now if growers will work hard, the saffron will again be a good revenue source for us. For the last two years, the crop has been very good,” said another grower.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/saffron-bloom-in-kashmir-raises-hopes-of-good-harvest-101636316511018.html

The special investigation team led by inspector general of police Surinderpal Singh Parmar probing the sacrilege cases will question Ram Rahim, who has been named as an accused in the sacrilege cases, at Rohtak’s Sunaria jail on Monday (November 8). Addressing the media in Phagwara on Sunday, Sukhbir said chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi and deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, who holds home portfolio, have been pressuring interim director general of police Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota to implicate the Badal family in Bargari sacrilege and police firing cases. Earlier, Sukhbir addressed public meetings in favour of SAD ally Bahujan Samaj Party’s state chief Jasvir Singh Garhi who has been named as the candidate from Phagwara. “The new Congress government, too, is working on the same agenda even as officials have been replaced. I have specific information that DGP Sahota has been told to identify persons who can implicate the Badal family in the case and also told to get their false statements against Badals recorded in the near future so that the Congress government can play a drama in court,” Sukhbir, who is an MP from Ferozepur, said while issuing to warning to the police officers against any such attempts. Asserting that Channi was following the line of his predecessor Capt Amarinder Singh, the SAD president said: “It seems that delivering justice to the Sikh Sangat is not the priority of the Congress government. The Congress party continues to play politics on the sensitive issue of sacrilege. It is due to this that the culprits are still at large and have not been convicted till now.” When pointed out that did he see the government closing in on Badals in sacrilege cases, Sukhbir said Congress party and its leaders, including state chief Navjot Singh Sidhu, were naming Badals for the last four-and-half years. “They even constituted justice Ranjit Singh Commission whose report didn’t write a single word against the Badals. Congress party is the author of Guru Granth Sahib sacrilege,” said Sukhbir. On the ongoing row over appointments to some top offices since Channi took over as CM, Sukhbir said the appointment of advocate general, chief secretary and DGP is the prerogative of the chief minister and the party chief (Navjot Sidhu in this case) has no business to interfere.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/channi-govt-trying-hard-to-implicate-badals-in-sacrilege-cases-sukhbir-101636316450861.html

Chaudhary added the decision to replace former chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh was taken after much deliberation after feedback from legislators, workers and various quarters. The party wanted to make the change long before it took place, but could not do so to the situation created by the Covid-19 pandemic, he said in an interaction with journalists on Saturday night, calling it a “considered decision”. Capt Amarinder Singh was made to resign by the Congress leadership on September 18, following a long-drawn tussle with Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu, four cabinet ministers and several party MLAs amid fears that anti-incumbency arising from his style of functioning could hurt the party’s chances in state assembly polls in 2022. Charanjit Singh Channi, who was among the rebel ministers, was picked as the first Scheduled Caste CM of Punjab. Chaudhary added that the biggest challenge before the Congress and the new state government (headed by Channi) was paucity of time. “We have got only 90 days. There will be only a few days for governance before the elections,” he said. He also spoke on internal democracy in the party, stating that every individual had the right to express himself. “It is for the organisational set-up to decide the level, where such views can be presented and the limit to which one can go.” The Rajasthan revenue minister was appointed Punjab affairs in-charge on October 22, in place of former Uttarakhand chief minister Harish Rawat. He had earlier worked as co-incharge of party affairs in the state in the run-up to the 2017 elections in which the Congress got almost a two-third majority. MEETS PARTY WORKERS IN CAPT’S CITADEL Chaudhary also met party workers in Patiala, the citadel of Capt Amarinder, on Monday, to gear up cadre for assembly elections. Captain’s wife and MP Preneet Kaur; mayor Sanjiv Bittu, PRTC chairman KK Sharma; Gau Sewa commission chairman Sachin Sharma; district Congress president KK Malhotra did not attend the meeting. Most leaders, MLAs and other prominent party functionaries attended the meeting. In his speech, Chaudhary asked the workers to gear up for the elections. He said that with reduction in electricity tariff and fuel, the common man in Punjab has been given direct relief. “Though the decision on Capt was delayed, we removed him as he failed to perform as CM. Now, Channi is performing well,” Chaudhary added. Responding to media queries on the absence of Preneet, Chaudhary said, “Leaders and prominent faces met me at Chandigarh, I came here to meet workers.” On being pressed for a response, “The party will decide on those who go against it,” he added. On replacing the Patiala mayor and other loyalists of Capt Amarinder in the royal city, Chaudhary refused to comment. Launching a verbal assault on Capt, Mandi Board chairman Lal Singh said, “I can assure every worker that Captain won’t be able to win a single seat. His only agenda is to defeat the Congress and we have to work to defeat this.” MLA Madan Lal Jalalpur claimed that Amarinder worked for officers, and not for Congress workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/chaudhary-says-capt-s-removal-as-punjab-cm-a-well-thought-out-decision-101636315490047.html

08-11-2021||Chandigarh||Your earnest inaction subverting justice: Navjot Sidhu to Punjab advocate general Deol||Rejecting the charge of derailing the government’s efforts to ensure justice in drugs and sacrilege cases and spreading misinformation for political advantage, Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu on Sunday hit out at advocate general APS Deol, alleging that his earnest inaction was clearly subverting justice rather than ensuring it. Sidhu asked Deol which interest (vested or otherwise) he was acting for when he appeared for the main conspirators and procured blanked bail for them. “Are you acting at the behest of those who appointed you in this constitutional office and fulfilling their political gains? Did you advise the government to challenge the blanket bail order procured by you or any other adverse order in sacrilege cases in Supreme Court?” he said in a dozen tweets addressed to AG in which he also raised questions over the actions of his party’s government in the state. The Congress leader further said, “You appeared for the accused, now representing the State and very soon you will seek elevation as a judge so that you can decide this case. Being the highest law officer, your focus is on politics and political gains (sic)”. Sidhu’s diatribe came a day after Deol, in a statement, accused him of obstructing the functioning of the state government and AG’s office. There has been a standoff between Sidhu and chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, who took over the reins of the Congress government in Punjab in September 2021 following his predecessor Capt Amarinder Singh’s resignation, over Deol’s appointment. As a lawyer, Deol had represented former director general of police (DGP) Sumedh Singh Saini, who headed the state police at the time of sacrilege incident and police firing on protesters six years ago. The PPCC chief has been opposed to Deol’s appointment for this reason and has been pressing for his immediate removal. Sidhu had resigned from his post on September 28 and later indicated the AG’s was part of the reason he quit. He, while withdrawing his resignation as Punjab Congress president on Friday, put Deol’s removal as a precondition for resuming his duties. Telling the AG that “justice is blind but people of Punjab are not”, Sidhu, in his tweets, also said the Congress came to power with a promise to give justice in sacrilege cases, in which he (Deol) appeared before the high court for accused persons and made serious allegations against the state government. “You specifically prayed for transferring the investigation to CBI as you were afraid of their false implication in sacrilege cases on accounts of malafide, malice and ulterior motives on the part of political party in power in the state of Punjab,” he posted. The PPCC chief said the AG was now representing the same government of same political party in power and accusing him of spreading misinformation, whereas, he (Sidhu) was fighting for justice in sacrilege cases. In the drugs case, he asked Deol what was unethical by proceeding against the accused persons on the basis of STF report. “Did Hon’ble High Court stop you? High Court itself gave a copy of the STF report to our government for consideration and you are shielding the inaction of the government under the guise of your own unknown ethics,” he asked in another tweet. He also asked Deol to leave politics to politicians and focus on his personal conscience, integrity and professional ethics which his job required.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/your-earnest-inaction-subverting-justice-navjot-sidhu-to-punjab-advocate-general-deol-101636315250612.html

Currently based at a Medical Regiment in the north-west of England, Chandi’s primary role is to organise and validate training for medics in the army as Clinical Training Officer. She is completing her masters degree in sports and exercise medicine, part time, at Queen Mary’s University in London and has been using two large tyres as a substitute for the heavy sledge she will be dragging along in Antarctica for her polar training. “Antarctica is the coldest, highest, driest and windiest continent on earth. Nobody lives there permanently. I didn’t know much about the continent when I first started planning and that is what inspired me to go there,” she explains. “Hopefully doing something that pushes me so far out of my comfort zone will inspire others to believe in themselves and push their boundaries. There are only a few female adventurers that have completed a solo, unsupported trek on this continent. It is time to add some more names, diversity and to make history,” she says. Chandi has always been keen to push the human body to its limits and sees her latest mission as part of this wider research. “Nothing is impossible. I’ve always had this idea that I can achieve something great, something that allows me to be a role model. I want my eight-year-old niece to grow up without boundaries, knowing the possibilities of what you can achieve in life are endless,” she reflects. As an “endurance athlete”, Chandi has run marathons and ultra-marathons and, as an army officer, completed large scale exercises and deployments in Nepal, Kenya and most recently a six-month United Nations peacekeeping tour to South Sudan. “Anything ambitious can feel out of reach at the beginning but every bit of training I complete brings me closer to my goal. My training expeditions in Greenland and Norway have helped prepare me and my goal is now in reach,” she declares.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/british-sikh-woman-army-officer-capt-harpreet-chandi-sets-off-on-solo-south-pole-adventure-101636314830669.html

The SP, who was suspended in March 2019, has been posted as SP Technical Support Services at Chandigarh in a transfer order issued by the state government on Saturday. “Bikramjit was reinstated couple of months ago but he has been given posting now,” said an official. In September, the Punjab and Haryana high court had ordered the state government to reinstate Bikramjit. He had filed a writ petition in court seeking his reinstatement, referring to instructions issued by the state government that if an employee is placed under suspension and disciplinary proceedings are not concluded within one year, he is to be reinstated. On October 9, 2020, the special investigation team (SIT), probing the 2015 police firing cases filed a charge-sheet against four accused, including Bikramjit. In November 2020, the home department sanctioned prosecution under Section 197 (prosecution of public servants) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). The government, in its order, stated that the evidence produced before it was sufficient to initiate prosecution against Bikramjit. Following this, the reinstatement of Bikramjit was put on hold. On October 14, 2015, two Sikh protesters— Gurjeet Singh of Sarawan village and Krishan Bhagwan Singh of Niamiwala village in Faridkot district— were killed during the protest at Behbal Kalan when they were protesting against the sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib. In August, 2018, the names of then Moga SSP Charanjit Singh Sharma, then SP detective, Fazilka, Bikramjit Singh, inspector Pardip Singh, who has now turned an approver, and sub-inspector Amarjit Singh Kular were added to the FIR registered for murder and attempt to murder of the IPC at the Bajakhana police station in Faridkot, following the recommendations of the justice Ranjit Singh Commission that inquired into the case. The SIT has named former DGP Sumedh Singh Saini and suspended IGP Paramraj Singh Umranangal as accused and filed a chargesheet against them. Now, a trial is going on against them in a court at Faridkot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/2015-behbal-kalan-police-firing-sp-facing-murder-charges-reinstated-101636314472088.html

Meanwhile, the MSRTC workers’ union announced that not a single bus would drive out of any of the depots in the Pune division from Sunday 12am.Sandeep Shinde, state president of the MSRTC workers’ union, said, “We have decided to keep 100% bus operations closed from as the state government is not ready to listen to and understand our problems. The organisation is already going through huge financial losses and the time has come for it to be merged with the state government. As Diwali vacations were underway last week, we worked so as to earn some revenue. But now the protest will get more aggressive till our demands are fulfilled.”“As of Sunday, more than 115 depots across the state are closed and this number will only increase as more and more workers join the protest,” Shinde said.Not a single state transport bus moved out from the Pune division depots at Indapur, Vallabhnagar, Narayangaon and Rajgurunagar on Sunday. The protest will spread to other major state transport stands such as Swargate, Shivajinagar and Pune railway station from Monday. Due to the strike, passengers have to travel by private tourist buses which are charging high fares.Ashok Sonawane, a passenger, said, “On Sunday, I had come to the Vallabhnagar ST stand to catch a bus for Mumbai but as the depot was not operational, I had to take a private tourist bus for Rs700 a ticket. This is like looting passengers and the state government should immediately find a solution as the common public is suffering during the festive season.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/not-a-single-st-bus-will-move-out-of-depots-from-midnight-sunday-msrtc-union-101636314470658.html

The district administration’s fire audit report lists 96 primary healthcare centres. Of these, 89 have completed the fire audit and 79 have gotten a fire safety certificate as well. The administration has stated that some of the centres did not get certificates primarily due to issues like staff training, and the licence for fire extinguishers not being renewed. The fire at the Ahmednagar civil hospital led to the tragic deaths of 12 senior citizens admitted to an ICU ward dedicated to Covid-19 patients.Collector Deshmukh said, “I have asked all hospitals and also PMRDA officials to join us for the review meet. Earlier, we had released funds to ensure that all hospitals under the Pune district collectorate, mainly in the rural areas, have complied as per fire norms. We will also request officials from PMC and PCMC to ensure that their hospitals are fire compliant. However, this meet will primarily focus on ongoing work at all hospitals and also the pending work that needs to be started.”Post the Bhandara fire accident on January 9, 2021, in which 10 newborns lost thier lives, the Pune administration had set a deadline for all hospitals to ensure fire compliance in the next three years. However, as of now, 80-90% of the primary health centres and about 50% of the rural hospitals and sub-district hospitals are yet to comply.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-district-collector-to-review-all-hospitals-for-fire-compliance-101636313990900.html

Compared to last year, however, it has risen owing to relaxed restrictions,” said Hasabnis.The readings this year were higher on the decibel scale in two areas of PMC and one area of PCMC. The Chaphekar chowk area of Pimpri-Chinchwad recorded the highest day-time sound levels with 84.4 decibels (dB). The Lakshmi road area of Pune recorded the highest night-time levels with 74.7dB on November 4.On November 6, the highest day-time levels were recorded in Swargate at 82.7 dB, while the highest night-time levels were recorded in the Deluxe chowk area of Pimpri-Chinchwad at 67.3 dB, according to the MPCB data.The readings for the above days were lower in 2020, but higher in 2019. The data is recorded from 14 places in PMC and PCMC.

Safar had earlier forecast that during Diwali, the AQI for Pune city was deteriorate to a very poor level. The weather department has also forecast that the city will not witness any rainfall in the coming few days.Speaking about the air quality, BS Murthy, director, Safar and scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), said that due to heavy rainfall at some places in the city, the air quality was better than forecasted.“We had forecasted poor to very poor air quality in parts of the city. However, on November 4 evening, many places in the city experienced rainfall which was intense. Due to this, the air quality was better than forecasted,” Murthy said.As per Safar, the air quality on Sunday was good at Pashan, Katraj, Hadapsar, Lohegaon, Alandi, Bhosari, Nigdi, Alandi and Bhumkar chowk. At Shivajinagar and Kothrud, the air quality was moderate on Sunday. As per Safar, PM2.5 (particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) levels were 32 μg/m3 (concentration of air pollutants in micrograms per cubic metre of air).Whereas on Sunday, the PM10 (atmospheric particulate matter that has a diameter of less than 10 micrometres) was 60 μg/m3.Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather forecasting department of IMD Pune said that there is a depression forming in Arabian Sea.“This depression is likely to intensify and move away from the Indian coast. So rainfall chances in southern and central parts of Maharashtra are likely to reduce. In Pune district as well, the chances of rainfall are likely to reduce drastically in the next few days,” said Kashyapi.However, in November alone, Pune district has reported 430 per cent excess rainfall. Maharashtra, as well, has reported 47 per cent excess rainfall in November, as per IMD.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/air-quality-index-aqi-for-pune-back-at-good-level-on-sunday-safar-101636313390845.html

On Friday, a day after Diwali, Gurugram reported an AQI reading of 472, and on Saturday, it reported an AQI reading of 456, with PM2.5 being the primary pollutant on both days.On Sunday, air quality improved slightly in the neighbouring district of Faridabad and was recorded in the “very poor” category with an AQI reading of 372, improving from an AQI reading of 449 in the “severe” category on Saturday.An AQI reading between 0 and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.S Narayanan, member-secretary of Haryana State Pollution Control Board, said, “The air quality is improving slowly in the national capital region. The Commission for Air Quality Management is also reviewing the situation continuously and is likely to issue some new directions within one or two days after a meeting. Over the next few days, the pollutants will clear out as wind speed has increased.”A weather bulletin issued on Sunday evening by the Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi-NCR stated that the air quality over the region is likely to improve over the next five days but remain in the “very poor” category, with PM2.5 as the primary pollutant. On Monday and Tuesday, the ventilation index is likely to be 10,000 m2/s and 14,000 m2/s respectively with a wind speed of 4-15 kilometres per hour, which is likely to help in the dispersion of pollutants. A ventilation index lower than 6,000 m2/s with an average wind speed of less than 10 kmph is unfavourable for the dispersion of pollutants.The bulletin also stated, “The contribution of biomass burning in PM2.5 concentration is likely to be approximately 30% on November 7 as winds are favourable for transportation of pollutants.”Meanwhile, on Sunday, residents reported industrial and scrap waste being burnt at Sector 87.Vikas Yadav, a resident of Sector 87 and member of Citizens for Clean Air, who noticed waste being burnt in the area said, “This is a plot almost 15 acres in size where waste is burnt regularly and I have been noticing it for the past four years. In the past two weeks, waste has been burnt on three different days here.

Chhath Puja will be celebrated on November 10 this year.KK Rao, commissioner of police, said that the chief minister of Haryana Manohar Lal Khattar will participate in the puja at Shakti Park in Sector 10 on Wednesday. “We have prepared a security blueprint for Chhath Puja and deployment has been discussed. Teams have been assigned duties and personnel have been deployed in plain clothes to keep a check on miscreant activities,” he said. Police said action will be taken against anyone found without a mask or not following Covid-19 protocols. According to officials of the district administration, an estimated 250,000-300,000 people from Bihar, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh live in Gurugram. Most of them will celebrate the festival at some of the prominent ghats in the city — Sheetla Mata Mandir, Chakkarpur, Maruti Kunj and Dundahera.

08-11-2021||Pune||A toxic mix of a civic mess is the reality of life in Pune’s Hadapsar||PUNE In early 2000, when real estate was relatively cheap, property in municipal areas under Hadapsar was a must-buy, a quality life was believed to be on the horizon.Today, Hadapsar is a toxic mix of traffic jams, garbage plants and water scarcity. When the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came into power in the PMC in 2017, it promised to address all these issues. As its term now comes to end with civic elections lined up in February next year, most civic issues have remained unresolved. Take for example, the Katraj-Kondhwa road widening. The PMC has missed its September 2021 deadline for completion of the Katraj-Kondhwa road widening project as work could not move ahead due to land acquisition issues. Residents of Tilekar nagar, near the Iskcon temple along the Katraj-Kondhwa road, face traffic snarls every day. The PMC planned to construct a 3.5-km Katraj-Kondhwa road between Rajas society chowk and Khadi machine chowk. The corporation planned three grade separators and two vehicle underpasses along the stretch. The foundation stone for the project was laid on November 2, 2018, in the presence of the then Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. However, the project hasn’t moved, and with heavy vehicles opting to use the same stretch and amid rapid real estate development, the traffic situation has worsened.Vishal Dhumal , a 37-year-old and a resident of the Life Republic housing society said, “I need to travel through the Katraj-Kondwa road on daily basis. While purchasing my flat, I hoped that this road would be completed as the work had started. However, it hasn’t progressed.”Smita Iyyer, who lives near the Iskcon temple and works as private tutor said, “It is very difficult to travel on this road. There is a lot of traffic and heavy vehicles. The PMC need to do it on an urgent basis.” Umesh Gaikwad, a BJP corporator said, “In the last five years, the BJP carried out various development works. The Katraj-Kondhwa road was pending for many years. BJP members followed it and got work started. There are some issues of land acquisition and the civic administration is working on it.” The NIBM annexe which currently represents one of the classic and premium neighbourhoods in the city faces several infrastructural bottlenecks which remain to be solved till date. The area is home to several prominent business establishments and residential societies lacks road infrastructure, drainage systems and a drinking water supply system. Daljeet Goraya, director, NIBM Annexe Residents Forum, which is highlighting civic issues on a regular basis, said “The problems related to drinking water supply, good roads, street lights, rash and negligent driving, resurfacing of NIBM annexe slope, road dividers, public parks and footpaths are yet to be developed and constructed in the area. The area suffers the most and PMC is not bothered to look into infrastructure despite taking taxes. We are in talks with lawyers and contemplating of filing a PIL against the PMC administration for its callous attitude and neglecting the area for past 10 years,” he said. While traffic is mess at NIBM and the adjoining areas, Hadapsar faces another problem with garbage depots. The entire city’s garbage is brought to this area for processing, resulting in a stink and other hygiene related issues.“Instead of building plants at other locations, the PMC is erecting more processing plants at Ramtekdi,” said NCP city unit chief and local corporator Prashant Jagtap. Previously, the PMC used to dump the unprocessed garbage at Urali where people staged a protest for years, forcing the civic body to look for alternate sites. Hadapsar also has some major townships such as Magarpatta city where IT and banking firms have set up offices. Many IT professions purchased flats here to avoid congestion. While they may find it easier to reach office within the premises of the township, going outside however is a challenge due to heavy traffic and narrow roads. Amol Tonpe, a 41-year-old resident of Magarpatta city and working with an IT firm said, “Our main issue is traffic. For the last two years due to lockdown, there was no traffic, but now life it is tough to cross this traffic. Even the road conditions are not good with BRTS becoming a joke.” The PMC had created Swargate-Hadapsar as the Bus Rapid Transit System for public transport. However, since its inception in 2007, it has been in shambles. Despite spending crores of rupees on the BRTS stretch, the Pune civic body has not been able to make it functional. This isn’t the only problem as locals also face a water scarcity. Rashmi Surana, a 36-year-old and living in Wanowrie and running her own business said, “We are facing a water problem regularly as there is inadequate supply.” Criticising the PMC for the shortage of water, NCP’s Prashant Jagtap said, “Earlier, water from Hadapsar area was provided to Ahmednagar road residents. Now as Ahmednagar road gets water from the Bhama Askhed dam, it was expected that Hadapsar residents would get enough water. However, the PMC has not been able to manage it properly.” Sachin Bankar, a youth from Hadapsar staying near the paragliding centre said, “There are more than 50,000 Guntewari homes that got constructed on small plots. The government order to regularise it came one –and-a-half year ago, but the PMC is not following the due process.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/a-toxic-mix-of-a-civic-mess-is-the-reality-of-life-in-pune-s-hadapsar-101636312912189.html

A day after the city reported slight improvement in the air quality index (AQI), it went from 159 points on Saturday to 240 (poor category) on Sunday. As per the national agency tracking air quality, the particulate matter (PM) 2.5, which directly affects the lungs, remained the prominent pollutant. “Due to cold conditions, the earth’s surface cools down rapidly and the air near the ground gets condensed.

The study was funded by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), New Delhi. The present patent relates to a method to determine steroid-resistant patients in childhood idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (NS) by utilizing pharmacogenomic biomarkers. The study has translational potential and has been registered as an innovation patent for eight years from August 16, 2021 to next 8 years. HoD, department of nephrology, Professor Narayan Prasad, who led the team for the study said, “Nephrotic syndrome is one of the most common kidney diseases, particularly in children, and steroid is the cornerstone therapy for this condition. Children lose a heavy amount of protein in the urine and swelling appears all over the body. Gradually, it may lead to kidney failure, requiring dialysis and renal transplantation.” He added, “About 10-20% of children do not respond to steroid therapy, and many patients develop steroid resistance after initial response. It’s difficult to find SRNS patients before steroid therapy, especially if they don’t have any secondary or hereditary causes of NS. Patients are treated with repeated course of steroid and develop corticosteroid toxicity. Treating these patients with steroids in non-responsive patients leads to all these toxicities.” Professor Prasad said, “I was working to develop biomarkers to identify these patients who would be less likely to respond to steroids in early stages, if there are no identified genetic causes of steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome. I designed this study with my team, including Professor Vikas Agrawal, Dr Akhilesh Jaiswal, Dr Saurabh Chaturvedi and Dr Harshit Singh. The study was published in the Nature journal, the Pharmacogenomics (TPJ), and an innovation patent was invited. Our team immediately applied for it.” SGPGIMS director Professor RK Dhiman congratulated Prof Prasad and his team for the first ever patent in basic science by any clinician of the institute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/lucknow-pgi-team-gets-australian-patent-for-method-to-determine-steroid-resistant-patients-101636311650521.html

08-11-2021||Chandigarh||GMADA wants to take over Mohali ISBT||With the Delhi firm finalised to take over operations of Baba Banda Singh Bahadur Inter State Bus Terminus in Phase 6, Mohali, not offering an adequate amount of compensation to the stakeholders, Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) is now planning to run the busopolis project.Once GMADA takes over the project, it will also take over all liabilities of stakeholders, investors and depositors and will run all activities of the commercial complex, except the operations of ISBT, which will be transferred to the Punjab state transport department.The ambitious project was launched in 2009, after GMADA signed an agreement with C&C Towers Limited, and was to be completed in December 2011. Spread over seven acres, it was to have an inter-state bus terminal, three multi-storeyed towers with retail and office spaces, multiplex, five-star hotel, banquet hall and hypermarkets. But since its inception, the project has been mired in controversies and possession delays. Twelve years on, while the bus terminal has become partially operational, the commercial towers are yet to be completed.In 2019, the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT)’s special bench initiated corporate insolvency resolution process of C&C Towers Limited, and KPMG international was appointed the resolution professional to settle the claims of financial creditors: banks, buyers and public allottees. Earlier this year, KPMG finalised Delhi-based Mahakaram Builders to take over the project and even called for claims from all stakeholders. However, the firm failed to offer an adequate amount of compensation to all stakeholders, including GMADA, which is a major stakeholder.Now, GMADA has put an appeal before the NCLT against the proposal of Mahakram Builders. “We have filed an appeal before the NCLT, as we are major stakeholders and had leased out the land to the company. We are now planning to be a part of the process and act as a bidder and run the project as our own,” said Vipul Ujwal, chief administrator, GMADA. Around 500 buyers who have invested around ₹100 crore in commercial properties at the busopolis also want GMADA to take over the projectHarbhajan Singh Jolly, general secretary of the C&C Mohali Junction Clients Association, said the company finalised by KPMG will not be able to run the ₹400-crore project. “We have requested GMADA to take over the project,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/gmada-wants-to-take-over-mohali-isbt-101636311540104.html

The professor had slept in a room on the first floor the previous night.As part of investigations, police recorded the statement of the couple’s daughter Parul Goyal on Sunday. She was not present in the house on the night of murder. The investigating officials refused to share her testimony. Meanwhile, the victim’s mobile phone, which has been missing, was apparently moved within the PU campus in the wee hours of Thursday, said an investigating officer. Police are trying to trace it.According to the preliminary postmortem report, the woman was strangulated to death. Besides strangulation marks on the neck, she also had some injuries on the head.According to Prof Goyal, when he went downstairs to collect milk on Thursday morning, he found the main door of the house locked from outside. Later, when he went to his wife’s room, he found her lying unconscious on the bed, with her hands and legs tied with a cloth. She was rushed to hospital before police could reach the spot. The investigations so far do not suggest any forced entry though the mesh of the kitchen and bedroom doors was found slightly removed.

08-11-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC proposes a month’s fee exemption for street vendors||The Chandigarh municipal corporation is all set to give fee exemption to street vendors for May 2021, when the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic was at its peak in the city.In order to contain the second wave, the UT administration had imposed a lockdown, shutting down all non-essential street vendors. More than 4,200 vendors stand to gain with the MC’s fresh proposal. The exemption is proposed for only non-essential vendors, as the essential and mobile vendors were allowed to operate during the lockdown period. “The agenda will be tabled before the MC General House for its approval on November 12,” said MC commissioner Anindita Mitra.There are around 3,510 street vendors recognised as essential service providers in the city. Another 1,140 are mobile vendors, and 6,259 come under the category of non-essential service providers.“Even among the non-essential service providers, the fee exemption is proposed only for those who have not defaulted on their vending fees. There are around 2,000 such defaulters who skipped the payment for the pre-Covid period,” said an official privy to the development.To cost ₹70 croreThe monthly vending fee varies from ₹300 to ₹2,000 per month according to the street vendor’s service. “The MC earns around ₹1 crore from the vending fee every month. The exemption will cost us around ₹70 crore,” said the official. The street vendors have been demanding the exemption for some time now, alleging that the MC is adopting a discriminatory attitude toward them. “While second-hand car market, parking contractors and the night food street have got exemptions and relaxations, we are still to get any respite for the second wave. Most of us had no alternative to earn a livelihood during the lockdown. Even later, the footfall remained very poor,” said a street vendor, who didn’t want to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-mc-proposes-a-month-s-fee-exemption-for-street-vendors-101636311537419.html

08-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi University principals criticise state govt directive on college grants||Delhi University teachers and principals have criticised a directive issued by the Delhi government’s Directorate of Training and Technical Education (DTTE) that sought action against principals of 12 DU colleges for violating central civil service rules.The Aam Aadmi Party, however, on Sunday said the colleges deliberately delay submission of utilisation certificates, and then blame the Delhi government for not granting them funds.In a letter issued on Wednesday, the director (higher education), DTTE, wrote to DU vice chancellor, complaining that the 12 colleges that are funded by the Delhi government were not complying with the conditions required for grant approval. According to the letter, the colleges are required to prepare their budget for grants. The director also said that principals were inciting teachers and sought action against them. In response, the DU VC wrote to the principals of the 12 colleges on Wednesday and sought a response from them. Condemning the letter, Manoj Sinha, secretary of the DU principals’ association and head of Aryabhatta College said the letter mentions all revenues including students’ fees which was not the income of the Delhi government. “The students’ fees received by the college is the income of the Delhi University. Delhi government is having a fundamental misunderstanding, “ said Sinha. He also said it was unfair to call for any action against CCS rules. “The government is accusing the principals of spreading rumours. We are innocuous people and not doing anything except putting forward our point of view. Now, the government is asking the university to take action against principals for putting forward their point of view,” said Sinha. AAP MLA Atishi, who is chairperson of the standing committee on education (Delhi Vidhan Sabha), said, “As per the terms and conditions of the grant, it is necessary for college principals to submit utilisation certificates in order to get funds. However, the colleges delay this process in every quarter. On one hand, the colleges do not fulfil the basic process and on the other they turn around and say that the Delhi Government is not giving funds. It is beyond comprehension as to why the Utilisation Certificates are delayed and why do the colleges blame the Delhi Government when the delay is on their end? ““It is paramount to understand the reason behind the lack of transparency in these colleges that they do not want to explain where funds have been utilised. At the same time, it is concerning that the principals, while being party to the delay on the end of the colleges, incite the teachers by spreading lies about the Delhi Government not releasing funds,” she said, in a statement.Teachers’ group Academics for Action and Development (AAD) member and former DU executive council member Rajesh Jha, however, said that the proposal of giving grants on a net deficit basis will lead to a steep fee hike. “The letter dictates these colleges to prepare the budget for a grant on a net deficit basis, which shifts the burden on the colleges to generate funds from the internal resources which means collecting funds from students’ fees. This will cause a steep fee-hike and thus create a financial barrier to keep students of marginalised section away. This is exactly carrying out the mandate of NEP 2020 for privatisation and contractualisation,” said Jha. Jha said that the imposition of CCS rules would stifle the voices of teachers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-university-principals-criticise-state-govt-directive-on-college-grants-101636311531811.html
08-11-2021||Chandigarh||No cap on gatherings at Chhath Puja begins in Chandigarh||With the four-day Chhath Puja set to start in the city on Monday, the Chandigarh administration will be keeping a close watch to ensure Covid-19 protocol is followed by the organisers and devotees converging at the lake in Sector 42. However, there will be no cap on the number of people allowed to gather at the lake as it is an open area, as long as they wear masks and maintain social distancing.Last year, Covid-19 rules against overcrowding had been broken on the third day of the festivities when around 2,000 people turned up at the lake to offer prayers to the setting sun. “We have approached various Purvanchal associations and advised them to tell the families to only send women for offering prayers, as it is the tradition, while men can stay at home to keep the numbers down. The venue has also been sanitised,” said a UT official, who did not wish to be named.Subdivisional magistrate (south) Rupesh Kumar said: “While devotees can enjoy the festival, we will keep a close watch to ensure that all Covid-19 restrictions are followed. If any rule is broken, then action will be taken.” Cops will also be stationed at the venue, especially on the third day, to ensure all rules are followed.Grand celebrations plannedMeanwhile, the organisers have planned the puja on the same scale as during the pre-pandemic times.Purvanchal Welfare Association president DK Singh said: “After a lull last year, all organisers will come together to ensure grand celebrations. Unlike, four to five stages set up by different organisations to hold their cultural programmes, we will have only one stage with one programme this year. We will also serve food to those fasting and make proper arrangements for those coming to the lake.”Singh said that with the municipal corporation elections set to happen next month, leaders of all political parties are expected to show up for the functions, but they will not be allowed to use the platform for campaigning. The four-day festival is celebrated to honour the sun god and is especially popular with those hailing from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. On the first two days, people hold celebrations and fasting at their homes. On the final two days, they converge at water bodies to offer prayers to the setting and rising sun. Although, the number of Covid-19 cases saw a decline between Dussehra and Diwali in Chandigarh, medical experts have advised caution. According to them, in view of the incubation period of infection, cases might start rising a week after Diwali.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/no-cap-on-gatherings-at-chhath-puja-begins-in-chandigarh-101636311530239.html
08-11-2021||Delhi||BJP MP Parvesh Verma wades into war of words over Chhath Puja in Delhi||The political war of words over the celebration of Chhath in Delhi continued on Sunday with the Bharatiya Janata Party MP from West Delhi Parvesh Verma announcing that he will perform prayers on the banks of Yamuna in defiance of the DDMA ban, and challenged Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to stop him from doing so.The Delhi Disaster Management Authority has prohibited Chhath Puja on the banks of the Yamuna this year. Earlier, on September 30 the disaster body had banned the celebrations entirely, but allowed it with restrictions following protests by the BJP and the written appeals to the Centre by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, and to the lieutenant governor Anil Baijal by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.LG is the chairperson of the DDMA.Criticising Kejriwal for “not allowing Chhath puja celebrations at Yamuna ghats”, Verma said that he, along with members of the Purvanchal community. will perform the puja at ITO Chhath ghat at 11am on Monday. “If people will not celebrate the Chhath festival at ghats, then where will they offer prayers? On the roads? I’ll go to ITO Chhath ghat at 11am (on Monday) with purchanchalis to start the puja. I challenge Arvind Kejriwal to stop us from celebrating the festival at the ghats, if he can.”The festival will be celebrated on Wednesday.The Delhi government is likely to issue on Monday its full list of designated spots for celebration of Chhath puja in the city, said a senior government official on Sunday.“There will be no arrangements at Yamuna and Hindon river banks this year because of pollution concerns, Covid-19 protocols and various construction projects. Locations are being identified in open areas within the city but the job turned out to be easier said than done because of jurisdiction-related issues and disagreements among agecies, mostly political. We have already started preparation in several locations. The final list should be issued on Monday,” said the official.Some of the locations where temporary Chhat Ghats will be set up include Dwarka, Narela, Rohini, Malviya Nagar, and Palam.The festival assumes political significance as Purvanchalis (natives of eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar) who are settled in Delhi and celebrate the festival are a major vote bank in the city.Meanwhile, AAP MLAs Sanjeev Jha and Vinay Mishra staged a protest in Dwarka demanding that a Chhath ghat be constructed there, alleged that the BJP was trying to obstruct Chhath puja in the city.“The BJP at many places in Delhi is stopping Purvanchalis from preparing Chhath ghats to obstruct the Chhath Puja. The AAP MLA and volunteers have come forward to construct Chhath ghat in Dwarka in response to this,” tweeted Jha who is the AAP legislator from Burari.The AAP is in charge of the Delhi government but the BJP is in charge of the three municipal corporations (MCD). And then there is the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) which is regulated by the BJP-led Union government.“All these agencies own land and need to invest in coordinated efforts to enable arrangements for Chhat Puja celebrations. The arrangements involve creating an artificial waterbody and providing basic facilities such as lights, water connection, power connection, toilets, changing rooms and space to ensure distancing. These arrangements basically need space -- from open grounds to parks in residential areas. The coordination efforts have witnessed friction, mostly over the last one week. But things look slightly better now,” the government official said.Chhat Puja is a community festival that involves worshipping the Sun and taking dip in a water body. It is popular among people from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand -- collectively called the Poorvanchal region. People from these states form more than one-third of Delhi’s current population of around 20 million, according to government estimates and migration data from Census 2011.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor appealed to the people to not pay heed to the “provocative statements” of the AAP leaders. The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) and the municipal corporations are developing ‘ghats’ for Chhath Puja, said.The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on October 27 allowed celebration of Chhat Puja on November 10 in the capital city with strict protocols.On September 30, the DDMA had issued an order prohibiting the celebration of Chhath Puja at riverbanks, near water bodies, open grounds, in temples, and other public spaces. Limited restrictions were imposed on other festivals such as Durga Puja and Dussehra.Chhath Puja in public spaces was prohibited last year too because of the pandemic.The Bharatiya Janata Party has protested against restrictions on Chhath Puja celebrations and organised several protests in October.On October 9, Kejriwal said the DDMA prohibited the celebrations because of the inherent risk of transmission in the rituals which involve gathering in large numbers.However, on October 12, after BJP’s Lok Sabha MP Manoj Tiwari sustained injuries during a protest outside Kejriwal’s residence in Civil Lines, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia wrote to Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya three days later, urging the Centre to draft protocols and issue necessary orders with regard to the festival.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on October 14 wrote to lieutenant governor Anil Baijal urging him to allow Chhat Puja celebrations in Delhi with adherence to Covid-19 protocols.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/bjp-mp-parvesh-verma-wades-into-war-of-words-over-chhath-puja-in-delhi-101636311293552.html
08-11-2021||Kolkata||EVMs swapped after Oct 30 Bengal bypolls, alleges BJP’s Suvendu Adhikari||Electronic voting machines (EVM) were swapped after the October 30 bypolls at four assembly seats in Bengal, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator Suvendu Adhikari alleged on Sunday, questioning the unprecedented margins of victory recorded by the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC). “Is it possible for anyone to secure 84% votes in an assembly seat? We have information that EVMs were swapped. The EVMs in Gosaba were swapped with machines brought from Behala (in Kolkata). We have tracked everything,” Adhikari said in his address at a party meeting held at the auditorium of the Indian Council for Cultural Relations in Kolkata.The TMC not only secured 75% of the votes polled in the four seats of Dinhata, Santipur, Khardah and Gosaba, but also created history at South 24 Parganas district’s Gosaba by securing 87.19% votes. The BJP, which won the Dinhata seat by 57 votes and Santipur by 15878 votes in the March-April election, lost the seats by 164,089 and 64,675 votes respectively. Polls in Dinhata and Santipur had to be held because the winners, Nisith Pramanik and Jagannath Sarkar, decided to retain their Lok Sabha seats. At Khardah and Gosaba, where polls were held because the TMC’s winning candidates died, the BJP lost by 93,832 and 143,051 votes respectively. The BJP candidates in Gosaba, Dinhata and Khardah forfeited their deposits. Although several BJP leaders accused the TMC of not allowing people to cast their votes freely, this is the first time the leader of the opposition in the Bengal assembly brought serious charges of electoral malpractice. He, however, did not name anyone as a suspect.Referring to some polling booths at Santipur in Nadia district, Adhikari said, “If one goes by the results, then even votes cast by BJP district office bearers and their families do not reflect in the final tally. How is that possible?” At all four seats, which are located in districts lying along the Bangladesh border, the BJP made the communal attacks during Durga puja in the neighbouring country an issue. Adhikari, while attending a campaign, had said, “The attack on minority Hindus in Bangladesh will increase the BJP’s margin of victory in Santipur three times.” Since the polls were conducted by the Election Commission of India amid tight security provided by 95 companies of Central armed police forces, the TMC took on Adhikari. “Has Adhikari registered his allegation against the EC? We did not conduct the polls. If the bypoll results cannot be trusted then we should suspect foul play in the Nandigram polls as well,” said transport minister Firhad Hakim. During the March-April polls, Adhikari defeated Mamata Banerjee at his Nandigram seat. She had to face the Bhawanipore bypoll on September 30 to get elected to the assembly and continue as chief minister. Banerjee challenged the Nandigram results in court. No EC official could be contacted for official comment on Adhikari’s allegation. Bengal BJP leaders also did not react to Adhikari’s allegation till Sunday night. The poll results were discussed on Sunday at the meeting of the BJP’s central executive body held in Delhi in presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/evms-swapped-after-oct-30-bengal-bypolls-alleges-bjp-s-suvendu-adhikari-101636311292039.html
08-11-2021||Gurugram||Namaz row: Roads not for religious activities, says Haryana minister Anil Vij||Reacting to the ongoing controversy over namaz in open areas in Gurugram, Haryana’s home minister Anil Vij on Sunday said that religious activities should be organised within the premises of religious places. People of any faith should not organise religious activities on roads and public places without due permission from the local authorities, he said.“Everyone should organise their religious activities at their respective religious places. People should refrain from organising religious events on roads and public places without permission from the local administration, it should be applicable to all,” said Vij.Rightwing groups in Gurugram have been campaigning against namaz in open areas and demanding that Muslims should pray only in mosques and eidgahs. There are only 19 mosques and eidgahs in the district, and most of them have been encroached upon.The issue assumed significance since 2018 when rightwing groups organised a series of protests against namaz in public places. After these protests, the district administration designated 37 sites for namaz but the issue is still being contested by Hindu groups.Last month, a lesser-known rightwing group Bharat Vahini started protesting against namaz taking place on Fridays in Sector 47. Residents of the area also joined the protest, which soon spread to other parts of the city. On November 5, rightwing groups organised Govardhan Puja at the namaz site in Sector 12A.Over the past two weeks, rightwing outfits tried to disrupt namaz at the open site in Sector 12 and on October 29, 35 protesters were detained for attempting to disrupt Friday prayers. Representatives of the Muslim community had agreed to relocate from the site, calling for an alternative space and the clearing of encroachments from Waqf Board properties.A few days ago, police and administration withdrew permission for the offering of namaz at eight out of 37 designated sites. Police had earlier issued a statement saying that permission for namaz at the remaining designated sites could be withdrawn as well if local residents raise objections.The Muslim community has formed a panel of 21 people to have a dialogue with authorities and the political leadership of the state. According to the community, they are forced to offer namaz in the open due to the insufficient number of mosques in Gurugram. “There aren’t enough mosques in Gurugram and it is convenient to offer namaz close to workplaces. It hardly takes a few minutes,” said Mohd Adeeb, chairman of the committee formed by the Muslim community.

08-11-2021||Delhi||No freedom from pollution in Delhi till stubble fires stop: Gopal Rai||Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai on Sunday said that Delhi cannot get freedom from pollution till an immediate solution as well as a long-term joint action plan is put in place to handle the annual problem of stubble burning.Rai wrote to the Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav, and demanded that an emergency meeting of the states of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan be called to discuss the problem of farm fires. Citing data since November 1, Rai said the spike in air pollution in Delhi has coincided with the increase in the number of farm fires in the neighbouring states.“I have written a letter to the Union environment minister, seeking his attention to the current state of affairs. I appeal to him to call an emergency meeting of the environment Ministers of Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi to discuss and implement immediate solutions to this problem. Delhi can only get freedom from being choked when an immediate solution is implemented along with a long-term joint action plan in place to get rid of the problem. I urge the Union environment minister to immediately call an online meeting so that a solution can be found at the earliest.” Rai said.According to the data shared by the Delhi government on Sunday, 21,623 stubble burning incidents were recorded by NASA’s satellite in Punjab, Haryana and UP between November 1 and November 6.“Along with Delhi Pollution Control Committee scientists, we researched the changes in pollution levels in Delhi since November 1. The data from November 1 to November 6 states the obvious — as and when stubble burning incidents increased, the pollution levels of Delhi degraded,” said Rai.He added that on November 1, when there were 2,077 farm fire incidents Delhi’s AQI was 281 (poor). On November 2, this increased to 3,291 fires and the AQI reached 303 (very poor). A total of 3, 2775 farm fires were reported on November 3, and 3,383 on November 4, and Delhi’s air quality touched 382, he added.“The number of stubble burning incidents shot up to 5,728 incidents on November 5, and the AQI levels (also because of pollution from firecrackers) rose to 462. The number of fires came down to 4,369 on November 6, and the AQI came down to 437,” Rai said, showing the correlation between the farm fires and the pollution in the capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/no-freedom-from-pollution-in-delhi-till-stubble-fires-stop-minister-gopal-rai-101636310874515.html
08-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Water supply restored after ammonia spike in Yamuna impacts operations||Water supply was restored across Delhi on Sunday evening, said the state’s water utility, after interruptions in several parts of the city earlier in the day amid a sharp spike in ammonia levels in the Yamuna.Delhi Jal Board (DJB) vice-chairperson Raghav Chadha said water supply in some areas was impacted on Sunday morning, and said supply would be normal by Sunday evening.“Ammonia levels in the Yamuna increased due to industrial waste and pollutants,” said Chadha, who is the Aam Aadmi Party’s legislator from Rajendra Nagar.Ammonia levels in the river increased to three parts per million (ppm) on Saturday night, affecting water production at the Sonia Vihar, Bhagirathi, Chandrawal, Okhla and Wazirabad treatment plants, he said. The treatment plants in Delhi can clean-up water with ammonia levels of up to 1ppm.DJB data showed that around 11am on Sunday, the Sonia Vihar plant was operating at 95-97% production level, the Bhagirathi plant was operating at 93-95% production level and the Wazirabad plant was at 97-98%.Some resident welfare groups in south Delhi confirmed that the situation improved around evening. Sanjay Rana, president of the GK-2 Welfare Association said the area received water in the evening.Chadha said that during the Dussehra-Diwali period, the Ganga canal — which supplies Ganga water to Delhi — is shut for annual maintenance. “As a result, production in the plants at Sonia Vihar and Bhagirathi, which too get their raw water supply from the Yamuna, drops by 50% during this period. Maintenance work is now over and supply has been restored,” he added.DJB operates nine water treatment plants — at Wazirabad, Chandrawal, Haiderpur, Sonia Vihar, Bhagirathi, Okhla, Nangloi, Dwarka and Bawana to produce 935 MGD (million gallons per day) potable water every day.A senior DJB official explained that out of these plants, those in Wazirabad and Chandrawal are more susceptible to river pollution as they directly draw raw water from the Yamuna.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-water-supply-restored-after-ammonia-spike-in-yamuna-impacts-operations-101636310873305.html
08-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Murder convict out on bail held for firing at two men||A 37-year-old murder convict, who is out on bail was arrested for allegedly firing at a group and injuring two men following a quarrel in northwest Delhi’s Jahangirpuri on Saturday afternoon. At least three bullets were fired by him and two of them hit two separate men, police said on Sunday. The entire incident was captured in a CCTV camera installed in the neighbourhood.Police said the 37-year-old, Naman Sharma alias Sunny, was drinking liquor and consuming drugs on the first floor of his house on Saturday with a friend named Ramzan. At least five friends of Ramzan arrived outside Sharma’s house and began calling out their friend by name. When they learnt that Ramzan was with Sharma, they asked Sharma to invite them as well.“As Sharma refused and asked them to leave, a verbal spat broke out between them. The five started pelting stones at Sharma’s house. This infuriated Sharma, who took out a pistol and fired three bullets that hit one Samsuddin and Naseem. Sharma fled the scene before the police arrived after getting a call about the firing,” said a senior investigator wishing to stay anonymous.Deputy commissioner of police (northwest) Usha Rangnani said that a case of firing and attempt to murder has been registered. “Our district’s special staff team, through technical investigation and manual information, arrested Sharma from GT Karnal Road. He was about to board a bus for Haridwar when the team caught him,” said the DCP, adding that the pistol used in the crime was seized along with two live rounds. Sharma’s interrogation, DCP Rangnani said, revealed that he was previously involved in five crimes, including a seven-year-old case of murder in Bahadurgarh in which he was convicted for life imprisonment. He was granted bail in February 2020 in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-murder-convict-out-on-bail-held-for-firing-at-two-men-101636310576092.html

Police identified the deceased person as Parveen Kumar (42), a relative of the family who was attacked, said police. Yashwant Yadav, the station house officer of IMT Manesar police station, said that he suffered two gunshot injuries in the liver and intestine. “Kumar was battling for his life at a private hospital and died due to excessive bleeding,” he said.Yadav said three other victims, including an eight-year-old boy, are still being treated at a private hospital, and the family’s pet dog, which was also shot, is reported to be out of danger. Meanwhile, IMT Manesar police have formed four teams to trace 10 people from a rival gang who are the alleged perpetrators. Police have identified Yogender, alias Rinku, the kingpin of a rival gang, as the mastermind and one of the attackers involved in the shooting. Crime investigation units are also looking for the suspects at several locations identified using technical and human intelligence. Police said the incident took place at the residence of a former sarpanch (village head), identified as Gopal, around 8pm on Thursday, when his extended family was visiting them on the occasion of Diwali. Yadav said the incident was captured on CCTV cameras installed inside and outside the house and four people were identified through the footage on Sunday. Police claimed that the two groups were involved in criminal activities before their relations soured in 2007, when Gopal’s sons, Balram and Sohanpal, allegedly murdered Rinku’s brother Manoj. “Over the years, the two groups were involved in a fight to establish supremacy in the area and both sides wanted to eliminate each other. Rinku took advantage of the situation and shot six members of the family who were partying after offering Diwali prayers,” said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/fallout-of-manesar-gang-rivalry-3-days-after-shooting-one-more-succumbs-101636310571840.html

But people should take precautions and not let water stagnate in their homes,” Shukla said.He said that some of the 60 patients suffering viral fever and related symptoms admitted in the hospital are dengue patients. Nearly 150 patients suffering from viral fever were admitted in Kailash Hospital in October this year.Dr Shukla has also advised the people to take precautions to be safe from contracting the disease. “People should regularly clean areas and prevent mosquito breeding. They should wear full sleeve shirts and full pants. They should consult doctors if they suffer from symptoms of fever, body ache, joint pain, and skin rashes among others,” he said.Dr Akash Raj, medical superintendent, Super Speciality Paediatric Hospital & Post Graduate Teaching Institute in Noida, said that usually mosquito breeding sees a dip during the winter season. “People wear warm clothes during winter, and that also saves themselves from mosquito bites and such diseases,” Raj said.The health department in Gautam Budh Nagar has identified 10 dengue clusters in Noida, and eight in Greater Noida -- which have reported the maximum number of dengue cases this season. The hotspots in Noida are Sadarpur, Chhalera, Mamura, Nithari, Barola, Chhijarsi, and sectors 5, 9, 22 and 51.

The authorities have denied the allegations of negligence.  In the video, the child’s father said that he took his wife to GMSH-16 on Sunday, wherein a doctor told him that they did not have much staff and asked them to get tests done or go back home. However, she later delivered at home.In a press statement, the authorities stated, “On preliminary inquiry on the basis of her medical record, she was due on December 21. She was advised to get an ultrasound, but the patient never reported back to the doctor or got the test done, as per record.”The authorities stated that after receiving a report of home delivery, a health team with an ambulance was sent to the home of the patient to assess the mother and the baby, where it was found that both were doing well. “The child had already been fully immunised as per protocol and the mother has been prescribed necessary medication.

08-11-2021||Delhi||Supreme Court panel flags violations at Ghazipur abattoir in Delhi||The Supreme Court appointed Delhi Slaughter house monitoring committee has flagged multiple violations of safety and sanitation rules at the city’s only official abattoir in East Delhi’s Ghazipur, according to an official report.The panel has also recommended that the Delhi Pollution Control Committee should inspect and test the ground water and air pollution that was caused by the slaughterhouse, and said that the viability of the operations of food business of a “highly perishable and highly susceptible to contamination product” adjacent to a trenching ground should be re-assessed. The committee has submitted its report to the principal secretary of the urban development department, a copy of which HT has seen.Located adjacent to the Ghazipur Murga Mandi and Fish market, the Ghazipur slaughter house was built by the erstwhile unified MCD, and is currently run by the East Delhi Municipal Corporation. It consists of three sections with one for large animals and two for small animals such as goat and sheep. It operates in three shifts with two shifts reserved for the domestic consumption.The committee has stated that the mandatory two-hour gap between the shifts is not being maintained which is a violation of food safety and standards act. The report states that the record of animals brought for slaughter “appeared bogus” as it contained merely the first names of the individuals. “The details such as their contact number, shop licence details where carcasses are to be taken for sale, and FSSAI licence number were found missing,” the report adds.A committee member said that the sub-committee spoke to persons present in lairage area but they could not establish the identity of people as shopkeeper from any meat shop in Delhi. Lairage is a place where animals are given rest of 6-36 hours before being slaughtered. .Among other violations, the committee has said that no veterinarians were found deputed for the ante-mortem (inspection before the slaughter) at the lairage area or the knocking box or slaughter hall for checking the carcasses.The panel also pointed out several violations of the food safety regulations, 2011 and Prevention of Cruelty Against Animals Act, 1960. “Chillers are required to maintain specific conditions such as temperature of 2 to 4 degrees Celsius and pH below 6 but they were found non-functional. Keeping meat which is a highly perishable item exposed to heat makes it unfit for human consumption. This is violative of Food Safety Standards and Food Business Operators’ regulation,” the report states. It adds that offals and blood were found littered in the parking area and there was absence of hygiene with many workers found operating without overalls, gloves or masks.The committee has recommended setting up of CCTV cameras in the slaughter house premises and that the live feed should be shared with the monitoring committee. It has also recommended that two-hour gap between shifts should be observed and the time be used for cleaning the premises, and records of meat sale and purchase should be maintained.Mohammad Arshad Qureshi, head of the Delhi Meat Merchant Association, said the slaughter house is at a distance of around 500m from the landfill site, and they are not facing problems due to its location. “In 2017, a section of landfill had collapsed and a pathway was blocked. The route has not yet been reopened which causes inconvenience to livestock traders,” he added. He did not comment about the operations of the facility adding that the traders have not faced any problems.Shyam Sunder Aggarwal, mayor of the EDMC, said he has not seen the report but added that necessary action will be taken on the committee’s recommendations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/supreme-court-panel-flags-violations-at-ghazipur-abattoir-in-delhi-101636310330590.html

According to the police, with the increase in fog during the early mornings and nights, the number of accidents has also started to increase.Six accidents took place in the last three days due to poor visibility in the early morning, said police.KK Rao, the commissioner of police, said that the accidents occurred due to poor visibility on the stretches that were covered in a thick blanket of fog. “Most accidents take place in the early hours due to the fog and speeding of vehicles. People don’t drive with hazard lights on and, while driving on the expressway, they accelerate over 100 kmph,” he said.Rao said police have taken initiatives to control the speed of heavy vehicles and regular patrolling will also ensure the condition of lights improves, resulting in better commute.Police said many commuters have complained that there are no emergency services on the stretch and ambulances take time to reach, delaying first-aid for accident victims.Over 200 personnel will be deployed in two shifts on the stretch from Bilaspur to Jhajjar exit, said police.Rao said they have informed nearby trauma centres to send ambulances on time in case of emergency. “We have identified key spots on KMP where most of the accidents take place during fog. At all such points, reflector tapes have been installed and medians have been painted to ensure commuters can navigate through these stretches during low visibility. In addition, we have also issued a fog advisory,” he said.Police said station house officers of police stations near the KMP have been informed to keep a check on the patrolling and to alert the police control room in case of any mishap.Rao said petrol pump teams and the shopkeepers have also been alerted to keep passing information to the police teams in case of an accident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/as-fog-increases-accidents-gurugram-police-form-teams-to-patrol-kmp-expressway-101636310150109.html

As per the health department figures, 31,875 residents had not received the second dose of Covishield till last Wednesday, while 16,510 skipped the second Covaxin jab. The enthusiasm among people to get vaccinated has dropped due to the drop in new cases, said an official.The Union health ministry has prescribed a gap of 12 weeks between the first and second dose for Covishield and four weeks for Covaxin. Experts say both doses are needed to prevent the infection from getting severe.Dr Sunidhi Karol, nodal officer for vaccination in Ambala, said the total eligible population of the district is 8,50,360. As per the centralised Cowin portal, 8,74,005 (103%) have been inoculated with a single dose and 5,80,696 (68%) are fully vaccinated as on Sunday evening.“To alert those who failed to appear for their second dose, our department is making efforts through a call reminder. Even if they don’t turn up after calls, we will organise camps at village or colony level and visit such beneficiaries starting Monday,” said civil surgeon Dr Kuldeep Singh. Dr Karol said that at least 135 such camps will be organised at rural and peri-urban areas and 13 at urban locations. Zero active case in districtMeanwhile, almost 19 months after Ambala reported its first case of coronavirus infection in March last year, it has zero active case for the past five days. The last active case, a resident of Shahazadpur block, was discharged from hospital after recovering from the infection on Wednesday.Officials said that despite regular sampling, there has been no new case for the last two weeks. The last case had surfaced on November 25.In a statement, the civil surgeon said, so far, 6,63,780 samples have been taken including RT-PCR and RAT, out of which 30,150 patients tested positive for the virus and 509 died due to the virus. Accordingly, the recovery rate stood at 98.31% and the death rate at 1.66%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ambala-har-ghar-dastak-in-as-over-50k-fail-to-turn-up-for-second-covid-vaccine-dose-101636310035972.html
08-11-2021||Gurugram||Job reservation for locals to hit industry, investment in Haryana: Business bodies||A day after the Haryana government notified a law to implement 75% job reservations for locals in the private sector, industrial associations in the city said that they would again approach the government and ask it to reconsider this decision as it could severely impact their functioning.The state government on Saturday notified the Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Act, 2020, which will be applicable from January 15, 2022. The Act envisages 75% employment reservation for local youth in the private sector with an upper limit of gross monthly salary upto ₹30,000.Industrial associations based in Manesar and Udyog Vihar said that rather than the imposition of this reservation, there was a need to prepare a roadmap to upskill the local youth so that trained manpower was available to the industry locally.Manmohan Gaind, vice-president, Manesar Industries Welfare Association, said that industry leaders were apprehensive that this decision will lead to ‘inspector raj’ as too much discretionary power would be handed over to lower-level functionaries and that could lead to harassment. “We are going to hold detailed discussions with the government and bureaucrats to make this policy industry-friendly. Bringing in 75% locals when trained talent is not available is not possible. If the need arises, we could approach the court for relief,” he said.Industry owners also said that due to this policy, many industrialists have already started scouting sites in Noida and adjoining Rajasthan as it is not possible to conform to such arbitrary rules. “There is a need to train local youth and make them industry-ready before implementing such a policy,” said another unit owner, requesting anonymity.Pawan Yadav, president, IMT Manesar Industrial Association, said the youth of Haryana are strong and self-respecting and do not want employment with the help of reservation crutches. “The decision to implement this reservation can have negative consequences as large industries don’t prefer to set up base in areas where such kind of policies are in operation,” he said.The IMT Industrial Association said they have also approached the high court earlier. “This law is going to hit the industry and new units will not come to Haryana. There is a need to create a trained industrial force before implementing such laws,” said Manoj Tyagi, general secretary, IMT Industrial Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/job-reservation-for-locals-to-hit-industry-investment-in-haryana-business-bodies-101636309970288.html
08-11-2021||Delhi||Pollutants from farm fires hit season high as Delhi air in red for third day||Delhi’s air stayed in the severe zone for the third consecutive day on Sunday as the average air quality index was recorded at 428, with the share of farm fires to Delhi’s PM2.5 (particulate matter) pollution spiking to the season’s highest so far at 48%. Scientists said despite an improvement in the wind speed to 8-10km/hr during the day, the high concentration of pollutants from stubble fires in the states of Punjab and Haryana ensured that air quality did not improve. Though the average AQI dropped from Saturday’s 437, the air quality stayed in the severe zone. The air quality in the capital plunged into the severe category on November 5, a day after Diwali for the first time since January, due to a blatant violation of the ban on bursting of crackers and the increase in the number of farm fires. According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (Safar), a forecasting body under the Centre, strong winds are blowing from the northwest bringing pollutants from the stubble fires to the capital. Despite incidents of farm fires dropping to 4,189 on Sunday from 6,500 on Saturday, Safar said stubble burning contribution was the highest so far this season. Citing the drop in the AQI on Sunday, Safar said the air will continue to improve and may end up in the higher end of the ‘very poor’ category (AQI value of 300-400), but added that the northwesterly winds will continue to bring emissions from the farm fires. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) said it will hold a meeting on Monday to review the situation and to consider implementing Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) measures mandated under the severe category. Currently, steps under the very poor category such as ban on diesel generators and three-four times increase in the parking fee are in force in the city. Prashant Gargava, member secretary, CPCB, and part of the sub-committee on Grap, said air pollution levels are gradually improving, with the IMD’s forecast showing air quality could improve to ‘very poor’ by Monday. However, a meeting of the sub-committee will be held on Monday evening to take stock of the situation. “No additional measures are being introduced at the moment. Another meeting will be held on Monday to see if this declining trend in AQI continues,” he said.According to the IMD, visibility at the Palam airport on Sunday was recorded between 1200 and 2200 metresthroughout the day, while wind speed was around 10 km/hr during the day. “Day-time winds continued to be around 8-10 km/hr. Visibility improved on Sunday, but by the evening, this wind speed had again dropped to ‘light’ or ‘calm,” said R.K Jenamani, scientist at IMD. Forecasts by the Early Warning System (EWS), developed for Delhi, showed wind speed is expected to be between 4 and 16 km/hr on Monday.Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy at the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) said with three consecutive severe days, this can now be classified as an episodic smog event and stricter measures under Grap may now be required. “In the past, we have seen up to seven consecutive severe air days and even then, only strong winds, or rain came to the rescue for Delhi. Until then, we may need more restrictions in place,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/pollutants-from-farm-fires-hit-season-high-as-delhi-air-in-red-for-third-day-101636309850133.html
08-11-2021||Lucknow||Prices will come down once BJP loses in Uttar Pradesh: Akhilesh Yadav||Samajwadi Party (SP) national president Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday said the prices in the country will come down once the saffron party lost Uttar Pradesh in 2022 UP assembly polls. Akhilesh also asked farmers not to forget the “mowing down of farmers” in Lakhimpur Kheri.Akhilesh was addressing the Jansandesh Maharally in Ambedkar Nagar and was referring to slashing of petrol and diesel prices after BJP suffered losses in the recently held Lok Sabha and Assembly bypolls in several states.The BSP MLAs Ramachal Rajbhar and Lalji Verma organised the rally marking their formal joining into SP.With Verma and Rajbhar being backward classes leaders, Akhilesh Yadav spelt a new slogan for the 2022 polls saying: “Is baar chunaav mein pichadon ka inkalab hoga, baaees mein badlav hoga (this election will mark revolution by backward classes to bring in change in 2022 assembly polls)”. Samajwadi Party is considered a party with largely backward classes and Muslim support base.Taking about farmers’ issues, Akhilesh said that no single community faced so much injustice and deceit as farmers under the BJP government.Yadav said farmers would not get justice as long as the BJP’s “triple-engine” government remains in power.“Do not forget that three governments that mowed down the farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri. The BJP government at the state, the centre, and “at Lakhimpur Kheri of the minister (Union Minister of State Ajay Mishra).”Hitting out at chief minister Yogi Adityanath, Akhilesh repeatedly referred to him as “Baba Mukhya Mantri”.Akhilesh said that the BJP government had failed on all the promises it made to the people and attacked the government over law and order, economy, jobs, farmers issues, development projects, and yet again charged BJP government of calling SP projects their own.Akhilesh said never before so many big leaders in such large numbers joined SP and never before SP got so much of public support. “It all makes it clear that SP and its allies might win more than 400 seats”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/prices-will-come-down-once-bjp-loses-in-uttar-pradesh-akhilesh-yadav-101636309811183.html
08-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Mobile snatchers who dragged woman in Dilshad Garden arrested||A week after a 22-year-old woman suffered injuries to her knees and hand as she fell from a moving cycle rickshaw while trying to fight off two bike-borne men who allegedly snatched her phone in Dilshad Garden, the Shahdara district police on Sunday claimed to have solved the case by arresting the two men and the brother of one of them who bought stolen phones.Before targeting the woman around 7.30am, the alleged snatchers committed two more crimes the same morning near Bhopura border and Gagan Cinema, both under the territorial jurisdiction of Nand Nagri police station in northeast police district. All three phones stolen on that morning by the duo, Rizwan and Mehraj, were recovered from the alleged receiver of stolen property, identified as Salman.A brother of Rizwan, Salman had further sold the phones to two men – Aman and Shahrukh. Aman and Shahrukh have also been bound down in the case for purchasing phones without asking for their original sale documents, said deputy commissioner of police (Shahdara) R Sathiyasundaram. On November 1, the woman, Lovely Gupta, left her Dilshad Garden home and boarded a cycle rickshaw to head to Jhilmil Metro station, from where she was supposed to board a Metro train to reach her office in Noida. She was near Sai Chowk in Dilshad Garden, nearly half a kilometre away from home -- when the snatchers targeted her around 7.30am.In her complaint to the station house officer (SHO), Gupta said the two men came on a bike from behind and started riding next to the rickshaw. “Suddenly, the pillion rider tried to snatch my phone. I was shocked by the sudden attack and tried to defend myself. But he pulled me by force, snatched my phone and sped away. Meanwhile, I fell on the road and yelled for help, but no one came to my aid,” said Gupta in her complaint filed on Monday, a day after the incident.DCP Sathiyasundaram said that a case was registered and several teams were tasked to identify and nab the suspects. The teams scanned nearly 30 CCTV cameras around the crime scene and it helped them get the registration number of the bike the suspects had used. The ownership of the bike was established and through technical investigation and information received through the human intelligence network, the suspects were arrested on Saturday.“Their interrogation led to the recovery of the bike. The two disclosed that they had snatched three phones on that morning and all were given to Rizwan’s brother, Salman. We arrested Salman and recovered one phone from him. He had sold the other two cellphones to Aman and Shahrukh. We caught them and recovered the two phones,” added the DCP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-mobile-snatchers-who-dragged-woman-in-dilshad-garden-arrested-101636309549925.html
08-11-2021||Delhi||Ghats along Yamuna to be restored to their original design||The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has prepared a detailed plan to redevelop a 7km-long stretch of historical importance along the Yamuna. The plan is to restore the ghats on the lines of their original design, and also put in place facilities such as cycling tracks, pedestrian pathways.The stretch, located between Old Iron Bridge and Signature Bridge, has been divided into four zones: Surghat, Majnu Ka Tila and forest area, Qudsia Ghat and Yamuna Bazaar.The Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (Intach) has prepared the redevelopment plan for the entire stretch, and is at work on a pilot revamp at Qudsia Ghat.A senior DDA official said, “We decided to rope Intach in keeping the historical and cultural significance of this area in mind. The idea is to make the riverfront more accessible to people.”DDA approved a proposal to restore and redevelop Qudsia Ghat in December last year.Divay Gupta, principal director of Intach’s architectural heritage division, said, “During excavations at the site for a survey, we uncovered 14 ghats that were covered in silt or sand. These ghats, which are not very large, were built by families in memory of their relatives... We plan to restore these ghats as per the original architecture,” said Gupta.The restoration of Qudsia Ghat, which started in mid-October and will around ₹16 crore, will be completed within nine months, said Gupta. The DDA plans to develop a 3km-long cycling track, a pedestrian walkway, toilets and parking spaces at the ghat.Gupta said a few ghats near the Old Iron Bridge were a part of Shahjahanabad.“We have some old photographs of the ghats, so the areas between the two bridges will be recreating using these as references,” said Gupta.Located along Ring Road, the area has 32 contiguous ghats, which are used for religious activities till this day.Rakesh Sharma, who owns a house in Yamuna Bazaar and is a member of the Yamuna Bazaar Priests Association, said, “A lot of people visit for a holy dip and prayers during festivals and other religious occasions. But the area is in a mess. There is a drainage problem here, and the ghats desperately need to be repaired and maintained.”DDA officials said that though it is called a “bazaar” (marketplace), the area has a series of old temples. The plan is to restore ghats and the structures using traditional material and techniques. “The additional structures that are obstructing the continuity of the ghats will be removed, missing damaged ghats will be restored, facilities such as toilet blocks etc will be built,” said a DDA official.As part of the restoration project, the DDA has decided to remove the hard landscaping at Sur ghat, in accordance with recommendations of the National Green Tribunal (NGT).“We will take up the restoration of the other three areas after the pilot project is complete. As part of the project, we plan to develop continuous cycling tracks with docks and pedestrian tracks for seamless connectivity among the sites,” said a senior DDA official aware of the development.The DDA is redeveloping the 54km-long riverfront, in a bid to improve the area’s accessibility and to check the Yamuna floodplain’s dying ecosystem.The plan was conceived after a 2015 NGT order.Manoj Misra, convenor of Yamuna Jiye Abhiyan, said, “The NGT has not prohibited redevelopment or restoration of historic ghats. The proposed redevelopment should be able to take inundation during the flood period and shouldn’t prevent spread of floodwater. There are specific orders for Sur Ghat that it should be demolished and redone in a natural manner.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ghats-along-yamuna-to-be-restored-to-their-original-design-101636309190829.html
08-11-2021||Lucknow||Yogi Adityanath presents political resolution, praises PM Modi’s leadership||Chief minister Yogi Adityanath, who presented the political resolution at the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) national executive in Delhi on Sunday, praised the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said he was helping a new India emerge. While Yogi lauded the PM, UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh, who along with state general secretary (organization) Sunil Bansal, logged onto the meet virtually and presented details of the party’s preparedness for the 2022 UP assembly polls.In the previous two national executive meetings, the party’s veteran Lok Sabha MP from Lucknow and defence minister Rajnath Singh placed the political resolution.A statement issued by the state government quoted Yogi Adityanath as saying that under PM Modi, the reputation of India has improved globally and the Indian passport has earned its due respect.“PM’s vision of ‘one sun, one world, one grid’ got solid support at the recent COP26 meeting in Glasgow. PM is the most popular leader in the world, according to a survey conducted by a reputed global agency. At the G20 meet, PM gave the important message of one world, one health, imparting a sense of direction to the world,” Yogi Adityanath said, according to the government statement. The statement also quoted Yogi Adityanath as saying, “PM Modi’s timely decisions helped the country fight successfully against the coronavirus pandemic that brought the whole world to its knees while continuing the developmental activities and looking after the poor and the underprivileged. PM Modi’s mantra of trace, test, treat and vaccinate has helped UP control the disease.”“Developing two vaccines in the country in a short time and administering more than 100 crore doses is a historic achievement. In Uttar Pradesh, 13.28 crore doses of corona vaccines have been given and 8.43 crore tests have been conducted. Forty-one districts of the state don’t have a single case of Covid infection today. The state is capable of conducting 4 lakh Covid tests daily. UP is also bracing up to tackle the third wave of the pandemic, Yogi said, as per the statement.The statement also said Yogi praised the PM for cutting excise duty on petrol and diesel on the occasion of Diwali to bring relief to common people, adding that UP has slashed prices of both by ₹12 each.“UP tops in the implementation of 44 welfare schemes of the centre,” the statement quoted Yogi as saying. “Uttar Pradesh ranks second in the ease of doing business in the country. The state has also emerged as the second-largest economy of the country in a very short time,” CM Yogi remarked.Furthermore, he said that due to the increasing investment in the state, 1.61 crore youths have got jobs in the private sector. Around 4.5 lakh have got government jobs in the last four and a half years, the CM pointed out.CM Yogi said that the UP government has decided to extend the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana in the state until Holi in view of the ongoing pandemic, which will continue to benefit 15 crore people of UP. CM Yogi also mentioned the restoration of law and order in the state in the last four and a half years, saying that illegal properties worth over 1800 crore belonging to mafias and gangsters have either been impounded or demolished.For his part, Swatantra Dev Singh said, “We will be contesting the elections on the basis of Yogiji’s leadership, honesty and development, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s honesty and visionary approach.”“We presented details like assembly constituency-wise meetings, booth verification campaigns and panna pramukh (head of a page on the voters’ list) plan. Along with this, there are dedicated workers who are leaving no stone unturned in ensuring that BJP wins big,” the UP BJP chief said. During the meeting, the BJP set newer targets in states where it was yet to make a mark and also discussed the political situation in five states, including UP, that are due for elections.The BJP has also decided to institutionalise PM Modi’s radio talk show “Mann ki Baat” in all the booths, including the 1.63 lakh booths in UP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/yogi-adityanath-presents-political-resolution-praises-pm-modi-s-leadership-101636308831605.html
08-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi cop held for murder used his investigative nous to wipe evidence||The investigating team probing the murder of a 28-year-old fruit vendor, who was allegedly killed by Delhi Police constable Monu Sirohi and his four associates on June 4, presented their chargesheet in the case before the Karkardooma court last week, said senior police officers privy to the development. From removing the victim’s clothes and all identification documents before dumping the body in the Ganga canal, disposing the clothes he and his two associates wore at the time of the crime into the Hindon canal, to washing the car used in the crime and replacing its seat covers and foot mats with new ones, Sirohi used all his investigative skills to ensure the murder he committed with his associates was never detected, police said quoting the chargesheet.  All his tricks worked to an extent, as the crime was not detected for nearly two months. When the crime finally came to the fore, it was too late for the police to recover the victim’s body from the canal and other important evidence related to the murder, said police. Posted at the Pandav Nagar police station, 33-year-old Sirohi and his four accomplices were arrested between July end and the first week of August on the alleged charges of assaulting, kidnapping and murdering Ajeet Kumar, a fruit vendor, over a road rage in east Delhi’s New Kondli and dumping his body in the Ganga canal in Uttar Pradesh’s Muradnagar on the night of June 4.The crime came to the fore on July 29--nearly 56 days later--when a 3.06 minutes-long video, which shows four men assaulting Kumar and his friend Atul, was brought to the attention of the police by Kumar’s family, who filed a missing complaint on June 13, nine days after Kumar went missing, said the chargesheet that runs into over 500 pages. The other arrested persons were identified as Sirohi’s relative Vikas Sirohi (32), Vineet (42), Harish (33), and Suraj, a 41-year-old habitual offender who has multiple cases registered against him at New Ashok Nagar police station. Harish is an AC mechanic by profession while Vikas and Vineet had private jobs. All the five are in jail.Despite solving the case and arresting the suspects, police could not recover Kumar’s body even as they scanned the canal along 15 districts of UP –from Ghaziabad to Etawah. Police have neither been able to recover the clothes of the accused from Hindon canal, nor the seat covers and foot mats of Sirohi’s Swift car. The available evidence the police have against the accused are the video clip, testimony of Kumar’s friend Atul and technical data to establish the location of the suspects around the crime scene. The sample of a blood stain found in Sirohi’s car has been sent to the forensic lab for matching its DNA with Kumar’s mother’s DNA, said a senior investigator.“Being a policeman, Sirohi knew how the police investigate and solve crimes. He used his investigative skills to destroy all evidence. We are hoping the DNA of the blood sample that forensic experts have collected from Sirohi’s car matches with the DNA of Kumar’s mother. In the absence of Kumar’s body, DNA matching is the only way through which we can link the murder,” said the investigator. What happened on June 4Quoting the disclosures of the arrested persons, the police in their chargesheet have said that on the evening of June 4, Sirohi consumed liquor at his barrack in New Ashok Nagar police station with his three friends--- Vikas, Vineet and Harish. Thereafter, all four left in Sirohi’s car to have dinner and reached New Kondli, where Kumar and Atul were present. Kumar allegedly banged his hand on the car’s bonnet, which infuriated Sirohi and this led to an altercation. “Sirohi and his associates began assaulting Kumar as the latter hurled abuses at them. Atul fled when Sirohi identified himself as a policeman. The four then bundled Kumar into the car and drove away, without realising that Kumar’s neighbour was capturing all their actions on his mobile phone. The neighbour did not tell anyone about the assault because of the enmity his family had with Kumar’s family,” said another investigator.In the chargesheet, the police said Sirohi parked his car in a forested area near Akshardham temple--the police beat where he was usually deployed, brought Kumar out while others remained seated in the car, went deeper into the forested area and strangled Kumar to death. When Sirohi said that he killed Kumar, his associates panicked and Vineet fled the spot. Sirohi, Vikas and Harish returned to the police station, from where Harish also fled.Since Sirohi knew that Kumar’s body will be discovered in the morning, he decided to get rid of it. He called Suraj and sought his assistance in disposing Kumar’s body. Suraj arrived and the three went to the murder spot, bundled Kumar’s body into the car’s boot and left for Muradnagar, said the second officer. “Suraj used his police ID to avoid paying toll tax. They first removed Kumar’s clothes and identification documents and then dumped his body into the Ganga canal. Thereafter, they threw their clothes into Hindon canal on their way back to Delhi. Sirohi dropped Suraj and Vikas at their homes before returning to his barrack. The next morning, he washed his car and changed its seat covers and mats in the Mayur Vihar area. Thereafter, he went on medical leave for nearly 20 days,” said the officer. How the case was crackedPolice said Kumar’s family suspected the role of the family in their neighbourhood behind him going missing for days and alleged foul play when the video clip emerged. Police learnt that the video was made by a member of the family against whom Kumar’s family raised allegations. The neighbour was questioned and the clip was found in his phone. The clip was shared with a personnel of the local police station. A policeman identified one of the attackers as Sirohi.“Sirohi was made to join the investigation. Initially, he tried to mislead the police by claiming that he was innocent. He confessed to the crime when we showed him the video clip and confronted him with location of his cellphone on the day the crime was committed. His interrogation led to the arrest of the other four men from Delhi and Jaipur. Although the car was property washed, forensic experts still found a blood stain in the car’s hood,” said the second investigator.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-cop-held-for-murder-used-his-investigative-nous-to-wipe-evidence-101636308413013.html

08-11-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: National Achievement Survey duties keep teachers busy, regular classes take a hit||While block mentors and district mentors of English, SST, Science and Maths are busy visiting schools across the district to oversee National Achievement Survey preparations, the teaching in their own schools is suffering in the absence of substitute teachers to fill in for them.Ludhiana has 57 block mentors and three district mentors for English, Science and Maths. While the district mentors remain away from their schools for long periods to prepare learning material for students and train teachers for National Achievement Survey , the block mentors remain on their toes with inspections in other schools. As per the orders of the former school education secretary, the department is supposed to provide substitute teachers when the mentors are sent out on field. But as the department has failed to do so, the burden falls upon other teachers in the school to accommodate more students or adjust classes. This, even as schools are already struggling with staff shortage.A teacher at a government high school, on the condition of anonymity, said, “Block mentors remain absent from schools for long stretches, which affects studies in their own school. Our school has a high enrolment rate, and in the absence of substitute teachers, it becomes difficult for us to fill in for teachers who have to head out for National Achievement Survey duties.”Voicing the same concern, a lecturer at a government senior secondary school said that around six teachers from her school have been included in the panel of block mentors, which makes it difficult for the remaining staff in the school to teach the huge strength of pupils.Sukhdarshan Singh of Government High School, Kot Mangal, said teachers should not be given administrative jobs. “There is already a shortage of teachers in government schools and on top of that, teachers appointed as block mentors or district mentors do not come to their own for several days. Ultimately, it is the students who suffer. Teachers are recruited to teach, and not for administrative jobs.”A senior education officer, on the condition of anonymity, said due to pendency of court cases regarding teachers’ recruitment, the department is unable to fill the vacancies and thus it is difficult to provide substitutes in each school. District education officer (DEO) Lakhvir Singh Samra said the department has provided maximum possible substitutes to schools. He added that substitutes of the block mentors and district mentors will be sent to remaining schools.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/nas-duties-keep-teachers-busy-regular-classes-take-a-hit-101636305769852.html

Gomti Nagar and Charbagh areas recorded the worst air pollution in Lucknow, while Charbagh and Chowk had the highest noise pollution, the IITR report showed.The IITR report titled “Ambient Air Quality in Lucknow During Pre-Diwali, Diwali and Post Diwali Festival” took air quality data from nine locations of the city.“The data revealed that both types of respirable particulate matters, PM10 and PM2.5 , monitored during pre-Diwali, Diwali and post-Diwali, were above the National Ambient Air Quality Standards of 60 and 100 µg/m3 for PM2.5 and PM10 respectively,” said SN Barik, the acting director of IITR.Barik also said, “On Diwali night, the level of PM10 had suddenly increased from the average value of 266.5 (on November 2 night) to 882.9 µg/m3 by 193.7%. The highest value of 1084.2 was recorded on the Diwali night in Gomti Nagar. The average PM10 value remained high even during post-Diwali night on November 6 with an average value of 322.9 µg/m3.” “(Similarly), on Diwali night, the level of (another pollutant) PM2.5 had suddenly increased from the average of 158.8 (on November 2 night) to 555.9 µg/m3 i.e. by 250.1 %. The maximum value on Diwali night was recorded at Charbagh at 833.3 µg/m3. Even the average value was high during post-Diwali night on November 6 at 215.8 .µg/m3,” he further said.PM10 are particles with a diameter of 10 micrometers. They are also called fine particles.Environmental experts say PM10 is also known as respirable particulate matter. Particulate matter is a complex mixture of soot, smoke, metals, nitrates, sulphates, dust water and rubber.PM2. 5 refers to particles that have diameter less than 2.5 micrometres (more than 100 times thinner than a human hair) and remain suspended for longer. These particles are formed as a result of burning fuel and chemical reactions that take place in the atmosphere.On Diwali night in Lucknow, the location-wise surge in PM10 concentration was: Aliganj (756.0 μg/m3, a surge of 176.7 %), Vikasnagar (880.8 μg/m3, spike of 281.9 %), Gomti Nagar (1084.2 μg/m3, surge of 327.7 %), Charbagh (1003.7 μg/m3, 251.9 %), Alambagh (915.3 μg/m3, 172.4 %), Aminabad (959.0 μg/m3, surge of 222.4 %), Amausi (730.5 μg/m3, spike of 217.5 %) when compared to the average on the pre-Diwali nights of November 2 and 3. As for PM2.5 concentration, the location-wise surge on Diwali night was: Aliganj (540.0 μg/m3 i.e. surge of 389.8%), Vikasnagar (510.5 .μg/m3 i.e. increase by 281.8 %), Gomti Nagar (672.6 μg/m3 i.e. 246.7 %), Charbagh (833.3 μg/m3 i.e 381.7 %), Alambagh (290.3 μg/m3, 100.8 %), Aminabad (810.9 μg/m3, 325.8%) Amausi (205.8 μg/m3, 125.8 %).NOISE LEVELSThe maximum noise level (98.4 dB) was recorded at Charbagh and the average maximum noise level of 89.4 dB was also at the same location.The noise levels were also measured at nine locations between 7pm and midnight for 20 minutes at each location during the night period. Also, during the day time, noise levels are monitored at all the locations. OTHER FINDINGSThe inhalable tiny fine particulate levels (PM10 and PM2.5) always exceeded respective National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) of 100 µg/m3 for PM10 and 60 µg/m3 for PM2.5 at all the air monitoring locations, the IIT report said. The concentrations of SO2 (sulphur dioxide) and NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) were well below the prescribed NAAQS standard of 80 µg/m3 at all the locations. However, both pollutants showed higher spike with comparison to pre and post Diwali nights at all monitoring locations. HEALTH EFFECTS“The traditional firecrackers can cause severe effects to the health of people like heart diseases, respiratory or nervous system disorders. Chemicals/ metallic agents-based firecrackers are a composition of toxic hazards. The urban population breathe toxic emissions of firecrackers combustion and suffers from nasal irritation and throat congestion,” Barik said.Noise and unwanted sound generated from bursting of firecrackers also creates impulsive noise and leads to non-recoverable hearing loss, the report added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/air-pollution-in-lucknow-above-national-average-during-diwali-iitr-report-101636303129356.html
08-11-2021||Lucknow||2 expelled BSP MLAs join SP at Janadesh Rally in Ambedkar Nagar||Two Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) MLAs, Lalji Verma and Ramachal Rajbhar, joined the Samajwadi Party (SP) in the presence of SP national president Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday at the Janadesh Rally the two jointly organised in Ambedkar Nagar. Both are expelled BSP leaders.Both Verma and Rajbhar are MLAs from Assembly constituencies in Ambedkar Nagar. Verma is an MLA from Katehari while Rajbhar has the Akbarpur constituency.Their joining is no surprise, both had announced their plan to join the party at Samajwadi Party state headquarters in Lucknow on October 25.The development comes a week after six BSP MLAs (suspended from the party) joined the SP. On October 30, BSP rebel MLAs Aslam Raini (representing Bhinga in Shravasti), Mujtaba Siddiqui (Pratapur, Prayagraj), Aslam Ali Chaudhary (Dhalauna, Hapur), Hakim Lal Bind (Handia, Prayagraj), Sushma Patel (Mungra Badshapur, Jaunpur), and Hargovind Bhargava (Sidhauli, Sitapur) joined SP in Lucknow.The Sunday’s Janadesh Rally organised by Verma and Rajbhar is themed largely on price rise with the slogan ‘Mehgaayi par vaar hoga; Baaees mein badlav hoga (There will be attack on price rise which will spur change in 2022 assembly polls)’.It’s almost set that Lalji Verma and Ramachal Rajbhar will re-contest their respective constituencies in the 2022 UP assembly polls- this time on SP tickets.BSP chief Mayawati expelled Verma and Rajbhar on June 3 on the charge of indulging in anti-party activities during the panchayat election earlier this year. Verma held the post of the leader of the BSP legislature party in the state assembly while Rajbhar was the national general secretary of the party. The expulsion of the two top BSP leaders before the assembly election surprised the political observers as well as BSP workers. The six BSP rebel MLAs who had joined the SP last week were suspended from BSP after they had opposed the nomination of the party’s official candidate for the Rajya Sabha polls last October.With this, as the 2022 UP polls are nearing, the SP continues to attract leaders from different parties and tie-up with small regional parties.Last month, two Congress leaders from western UP, Harendra Malik and his son Pankaj Malik, joined SP soon after the party announced an alliance with the former BJP-ally-turned-rival Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP). Earlier this week, Akhilesh Yadav announced that his party will ally with Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) and Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party-Lohia (PSP-L) of his estranged uncle Shivpal Yadav.“The SP will not ally with any big political party but will instead opt for strategic alliances with small regional parties,” the SP chief had been repeatedly saying at press conferences.On the day, when six BSP MLAs and one BJP MLA (Rakesh Rathore of Sitapur Sadar constituency) joined SP, senior Uttar Pradesh minister and state government spokesman Sidharth Nath Singh said that Samajwadi Party may have been making lofty claims of victory in the 2022 assembly polls but the fact remains that it has been inducting “rejects” of other parties to complete its list of 403 candidates. It only manifests the desperation of Akhilesh Yadav who had been busy taking in leaders from other parties left and right. It clearly shows that his party did not have candidates for the 2022 elections, the BJP leader said.Uttar Pradesh is likely to go to the polls early next year for its 403 seats assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/2-expelled-bsp-mlas-join-sp-at-janadesh-rally-in-ambedkar-nagar-101636285066951.html
08-11-2021||World||6 Palestinian rights activists hacked by NSO spyware: Report||Security researchers disclosed Monday that spyware from the notorious Israeli hacker-for-hire company NSO Group was detected on the cellphones of six Palestinian human rights activists, half affiliated with groups that Israel’s defense minister controversially claimed were involved in terrorism.The revelation marks the first known instance of Palestinian activists being targeted by the military-grade Pegasus spyware. Its use against journalists, rights activists and political dissidents from Mexico to Saudi Arabia has been documented since 2015.A successful Pegasus infection surreptitiously gives intruders access to everything a person stores and does on their phone, including real-time communications.It's not clear who placed the NSO spyware on the activists’ phones, said the researcher who first detected it, Mohammed al-Maskati of the nonprofit Frontline Defenders.Shortly after the first two intrusions were identified in mid-October, Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz declared six Palestinian civil society groups to be terrorist organizations. Ireland-based Frontline Defenders and at least two of the victims say they consider Israel the main suspect and believe the designation may have been timed to try to overshadow the hacks’ discovery, though they have provided no evidence to substantiate those assertions.Israel has provided little evidence publicly to support the terrorism designation, which the Palestinian groups say aims to dry up their funding and muzzle opposition to Israeli military rule. Three of the hacked Palestinians work for the civil society groups. The others do not, and wish to remain anonymous, Frontline Defenders says.The forensic findings, independently confirmed by security researchers from Amnesty International and the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab in a joint technical report, come as NSO Group faces growing condemnation over the abuse of its spyware and Israel takes heat for lax oversight of its digital surveillance industry.Last week, the Biden administration blacklisted the NSO Group and a lesser-known Israeli competitor, Candiru, barring them from U.S. technology.Asked about the allegations its software was used against the Palestinian activists, NSO Group said in a statement that it does not identify its customers for contractual and national security reasons, is not privy to whom they hack and sells only to government agencies for use against “serious crime and terror.”An Israeli defense official said in a brief statement that the designation of the six organizations was based on solid evidence and that any claim it is related to the use of NSO software is unfounded. The statement had no other details, and officials declined requests for further comment. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss security matters.Israel’s Defense Ministry approves the export of spyware produced by NSO Group and other private Israeli companies that recruit from the country’s top cyber-capable military units. Critics say the process is opaque.It's not known precisely when or how the phones were violated, the security researchers said. But four of the six hacked iPhones exclusively used SIM cards issued by Israeli telecom companies with Israeli 972 area code numbers, said the Citizen Lab and Amnesty researchers. That led them to question claims by NSO Group that exported versions of Pegasus cannot be used to hack Israeli phone numbers. NSO Group has also said it doesn’t target U.S. numbers.Among those hacked was Ubai Aboudi, a 37-year-old economist and U.S. citizen. He runs the seven-person Bisan Center for Research and Development in Ramallah, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, one of the six groups Gantz slapped with terrorist designations on Oct. 22.The other two hacked Palestinians who agreed to be named are researcher Ghassan Halaika of the Al-Haq rights group and attorney Salah Hammouri of Addameer, also a human rights organization. The other three designated groups are Defense for Children International-Palestine, the Union of Palestinian Women’s Committees and the Union of Agricultural Work Committees.Aboudi said he lost “any sense of safety” through the “dehumanizing” hack of a phone that is at his side day and night and holds photos of his three children. He said his wife, the first three nights after learning of the hack, “didn’t sleep from the idea of having such deep intrusions into our privacy.”He was especially concerned about eavesdroppers being privy to his communications with foreign diplomats. The researchers' examination of Aboudi’s phone determined it was infected by Pegasus in February.Aboudi accused Israel of “sticking the terrorist logo” on the groups after failing to persuade European governments and others to cut off financial support.Israel says the groups are linked to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a leftist political faction with an armed wing that has killed Israelis. Israel and Western governments consider the PFLP a terror group. Aboudi served a 12-month sentence last year after being convicted of charges of involvement in the PFLP but denies ever belonging to the group.Tehilla Shwartz Altshuler, a legal expert at the Israel Democracy Institute, called the findings “really disturbing,” especially if it is proven that Israel's security agencies, who are largely exempt from the country's privacy laws, have been using NSO Group's commercial spyware.“This actually complicates the relationship of the government with NSO," said Altshuler, if the government is indeed both a client and regulator in a relationship conducted under secrecy.The executive director of Frontline Defenders, Andrew Anderson, said the NSO Group cannot be trusted to ensure its spyware is not used illegally by its customers and says Israel should face international reproach if it does not bring the company to heel.“If the Israeli government refuses to take action then this should have consequences in terms of the regulation of trade with Israel,” he said via email.Al-Maskati, the researcher who discovered the hacks, said he was first alerted on Oct. 16 by Halaika, whose phone was determined to have been hacked in July 2020. Al-Haq engages in sensitive communications with the International Criminal Court, among others, involving alleged human rights abuses.“As human rights defenders living under occupation, we expect it was the (Israeli) occupation,” Halaika said when asked who he believed was behind the hack.The phone of the third named hacking victim, Hammouri, was apparently compromised in April, the researchers said. A dual French national living in Jerusalem, Hammouri previously served a seven-year sentence for security offenses, and Israel considers him a PFLP operative, allegations he denies.Hammouri declined to speculate who was behind the hack, saying “we have to determine who had the ability and who had the motive.”After Halaika alerted him, Al-Maskati said he scanned 75 phones of Palestinian activists, finding the six infections. He could not determine how the phones were hacked, he said, though the timeline of evidence encountered indicated the use of a so-called “iMessage zero-click” exploit NSO Group used on iPhones. The exploit is highly effective, requiring no user intervention, as phishing attempts typically do.Facebook has sued NSO Group over the use of a somewhat similar exploit that allegedly intruded via its globally popular encrypted WhatsApp messaging app.A snowballing of new revelations about the hacking of public figures — including Hungarian investigative journalists, the fiancée of slain Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi and an ex-wife of the ruler of Dubai — has occurred since a consortium of international news organizations reported in July on a list of possible NSO Group surveillance targets. The list was obtained from an unnamed source by Amnesty International and the Paris-based journalism nonprofit Forbidden Stories. Among those listed was an Associated Press journalist.From that list of 50,000 phone numbers, reporters from various news organizations were able to confirm at least 47 additional successful hacks, the Washington Post has reported.NSO Group denied ever maintaining such a list.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/6-palestinian-rights-activists-hacked-by-nso-spyware-report-101636367104509.html

Vaccines, testing, and enhancement of handling people recuperating at home and hotels from the discovery of infection to treatment, we are going to strengthen our steps and the holistic plan will be revealed [in] the first half of this month," Yoshihiko told a press conference when asked whether the government will introduce free PCR tests and antigen tests for all willing.The package of measures, which will also include more hospital beds for coronavirus patients, and an opportunity for people with mild symptoms to undergo quarantine in specially designated facilities, including hotels, is aimed to identify positive Covid-19 cases at the early stage.The new plan is expected to help the government prevent a repeat of the scenario of the fifth wave this summer, when the surging numbers of infections led to overloading of medical facilities and shortage of hospital beds.On Sunday, Japan registered no coronavirus-related fatalities over the past 24 hours for the first time in about 15 months as the country's vaccination campaign is progressing. About 73% of the country's population have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-mulls-making-covid-19-testing-free-for-more-people-101636361078665.html

But they must be fully vaccinated to gain entry.All non-American and non-immigrant travellers will be required to show proof of vaccination before airlines will let them to board US-bound flights.Children under 18, participants in clinical trials, people with certain contraindications to the vaccine and those in need to travel in emergency or for humanitarian reason, which will have to be certified by the US government, will be exempted, according to a protocol released by the US government in October. They will still have to test for Covid-19, however, except children under-2.Airlines have been made responsible for enforcing the new travel. “We’re taking an important step forward in operationalising this new system as it relates to international air travel by releasing a series of documents that will help airlines and travellers get ready for November 8 and ensure a smooth transition to the new system,” a senior Biden administration official said to reporters previewing the regulation.As reported by this newspaper earlier under the new protocol, airlines will require travellers to furnish proof of vaccination issued by an official source - for example, a public health agency, government agency - in the country where the vaccine was given.All travellers - US citizens, non-citizens, immigrants and non-immigrants - will also be required to produce a negative test for Covid-19, done in the past 24 hours of travel date.Under the new protocol the airlines will only accept WHO approved vaccines. “Individuals can be considered fully vaccinated ≥2 weeks (more than two weeks) after receipt of the last dose if they have received any single dose of an FDA approved/authorised or WHO EUL (emergency use listing) approved single-dose series (i.e., Janssen), or any combination of two doses of an FDA approved/authorised or WHO emergency use listed Covid-19 two-dose series (i.e. mixing and matching),” the White House had said then.WHO recognises 10 vaccines. One of them is the Serum Institute of India’s Covidshield, which is the widely administered Indian version of AstraZeneca’s vaccine that the US has not approved but pre-ordered millions of does for its stockpile.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-foreign-travellers-welcome-again-in-the-us-from-today-101636345916748.html

The occasion also sees radiographers from across the globe promote radiography as a career, as well as a vital contributor to modern healthcare. The first World Radiography Day was celebrated in 2012, with the European Society of Radiology (ESR), Radiological Society of North America (RSNA), and American College of Radiology (ACR) coming together for the initiative. A predecessor for this event was the European Day of Radiology, which was organised by the ESR on February 10, 2011 to coincide with the death anniversary of Wilhem Rontgen, who passed away on February 10, 1923.However, the World Radiography Day celebrations replaced the European Day of Radiology, with November 8, the anniversary of X-ray discovery by Rontgen, being chosen for annual celebrations.Globally, various organisations celebrate this day, including the UK's Society of Radiographers (SoR) and the Association of Radiographers in Nigeria, among others. In India, the Radiographers Association of Madhya Pradesh has been observing this day since 1996, when it was proposed by Shivakant Vajpai, the secretary of the organisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-radiography-day-2021-history-and-significance-of-international-day-of-radiology-101636334483194.html

She couldn’t work as an agricultural labourer back at home, because, she said, the extended rain had made it hard for landowners. When I met her, she was removing water hyacinth from acres of mud flats. The owner mentioned the rains had flooded his fields, turning them into shallow ponds. He lost a season of farming plus spent money to clear the land when it dried. Hundreds of thousands of climate impacted landowners and workers exist. Who will pay for their loss and damage? Who will pay for them to adapt to a new era?India has asked for climate finance to meet its own goals. We lose money every time we are hit by a climate event. By some estimates, Cyclone Amphan cost India 14 billion dollars. But step back into history. India suffered enormous economic losses during colonialism, as both its resources and bullion was taken away to build other empires. The lifestyles and growth these spawned beyond our shores precipitated climate change as we see it today. Today, India is rebuilding itself, after being leached. The finance it needs is not finance but reparations -- a return of its own wealth so it can save its own people. While we shift to renewable energy and adapt to climate change in multiple ways, it is important that India’s history – and that of many other colonized countries -- be part of the battle against climate change.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/climate-finance-key-for-developing-nations-101636326059932.html

Pradhan further noted that despite the first spell of rain almost ending in Tamil Nadu, the worrisome situation is the forecast by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) pertaining to extremely heavy rainfall between November 9 and 11, which could cause flooding and waterlogging in the state.“The rainfall will mainly affect Tamil Nadu and southern Andhra Pradesh. It is not expected to affect Kerala. As per the prediction, we have deployed NDRD teams,” Pradhan was quoted as saying by ANI.Also Read | Chennai rains: IMD issues red alert for city, 4 NDRF teams deployed, several areas flooded as rainfall continuesHe pointed out that of the more than 20 additional NDRF teams that will be deployed in both the southern states, a maximum of 10 to15 will reach Tamil Nadu. “A few teams will be kept in reserve positions for additional support,” Pradhan told ANI.The NDRF director general said that at the moment the force is deciding the exact number of personnel required to be deployed in each area of Tamil Nadu but the focus “will be on Chennai city.”The NDRF has already pre-deployed four of its teams in Tamil Nadu on the request of the MK Stalin-led government. Of these, one team each has been assigned for Thiruvallur and Chengalpattu districts, while two others have been deployed in Madurai.Starting Saturday night through Sunday, Chennai and adjoining regions of Tamil Nadu received record rainfall in a single day with 210mm since 2015 owing to the continued impact of La Nina. This led to massive waterlogging in Chennai with vehicles getting stranded and people needing to wade through knee-deep rainwater.Moreover, the Tamil Nadu government has declared closure of schools in Chennai, Chengalpattu, Thiruvallur and Kancheepuram till November 9.According to the latest IMD bulletin, isolated heavy to very heavy rainfall is very likely over Tamil Nadu on November 9.

It is a journalist's job to inform, to highlight and present the true picture of events. It is not the journalist's job to please people in power," the journalist body said.The IWPC slammed the Tripura Police action against Singh, alleging that the slapping of UAPA charge is "a clear attempt" to silence journalists by misusing laws to intimidate them."The IWPC demands that all such charges be withdrawn immediately and the media be allowed to do its work freely," the journalist body said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/attempt-to-silence-media-iwpc-slams-tripura-cops-action-against-journalists-101636390807041.html
08-11-2021||India||India to host top security officials of seven countries for dialogue on Afghanistan||India will bring together top security officials of seven countries, including Iran and Russia, for a dialogue on Afghanistan aimed at forging a cooperative approach for tackling threats such as terrorism and radicalisation in the aftermath of the Taliban takeover.The Delhi Regional Security Dialogue on November 10, to be chaired by National Security Adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval, will be attended by Iran’s Supreme National Security Council secretary Rear Admiral Ali Shamkhani, Russia’s Security Council secretary Nikolai Patrushev, and NSAs or security council secretaries of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.Though this is the first such meeting on Afghanistan to be chaired by India, the dialogue is a continuation of a mechanism whereby Iran hosted two meets in 2018 and 2019. Pakistan and China were also invited to this week’s meeting but will not be present.Pakistan NSA Moeed Yusuf said earlier this month that he would not attend, and people familiar with the matter said on Monday that the Chinese side had informed India it would be unable to participate because of “scheduling difficulties”. The Chinese side also said it was open to maintaining contacts with India on the situation in Afghanistan through bilateral or multilateral channels, they said on condition of anonymity.The dialogue on November 10 will focus on forging consensus on the challenges currently emanating from Afghanistan and finding common ground on a way forward, the people said.According to an Indian assessment, the five main threats and challenges following the Taliban takeover of Kabul on August 15 are - terrorism within Afghanistan and across its borders, radicalisation and extremism, cross-border movements which are a key concern for Central Asian states, drug production and trafficking, and the threat emanating from vast amounts of weapons and military gear left behind in Afghanistan by US troops.The people said the regional countries attending the dialogue had similar concerns, especially about the uncertainty in Afghanistan, and India is confident about achieving unanimity on the problems being faced by the Afghan people.“The most important deliverable [from the meeting] will be that the key countries of the region agree on the threats that we all face, and also agree on what should be done in the future. Sometimes, the difficulty is that you do not have a consensus on the threats you face,” one of the people cited above said.The people noted that none of the countries participating in the meeting had recognised or legitimised the Taliban set up in Kabul. They also pointed out the Delhi Regional Security Dialogue is different from other mechanisms on Afghanistan because it involves senior security officials.While some regional countries such as Russia and Iran are more engaged with the Taliban, they still have a high degree of convergence with India on points of concern and objectives in Afghanistan, such as respecting diversity and rights of minorities and inculcating a culture of moderation, the people added.The Central Asian states also have concerns about the implications of the Taliban takeover on their societies, such as emboldening of “hotheads”, the person cited above said. “They are not ready for any export of ideology from Afghanistan into their societies,” he added.The people also said it was unfortunate that Pakistan had opted not to participate in the meeting, and noted that there is a “credibility gap” between Pakistan’s actions and intentions for Afghanistan. If Pakistan was truly sincere about helping Afghanistan, it should have allowed the routing of India’s humanitarian aid through its soil, they said. Pointing to Pakistan’s support for the Taliban over the years, including providing resources and bases, the people said most regional countries recognise Pakistan as a source of the problem though some are not inclined to say this publicly. The external affairs ministry said in a statement that the dialogue will review the security situation in the region arising from developments in Afghanistan. It will deliberate on measures to address security challenges and support the Afghan people in promoting peace, security and stability.“India has traditionally enjoyed close and friendly ties with the people of Afghanistan and has called for a unified international response to address the security and humanitarian challenges facing Afghanistan. The forthcoming meeting is a step in that direction,” the statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-host-top-security-officials-of-seven-countries-for-dialogue-on-afghanistan-101636390861413.html

Certain parts of the city remained disconnected from power supply owing to the rain. Chengalpet, Kancheepuram, Tiruvallur and Vellore along with capital Chennai received mild to moderate and intermittent rainfall since early Monday.The IMD in its bulletin said that a cyclonic circulation over southeast Bay of Bengal and adjoining South Andaman sea, extending up to 5.8 kms above the mean sea level, persists. It said that due to the cyclonic circulation’s influence a low pressure is likely to form over southeast Bay of Bengal and neighbourhood during the next 24 hours and is likely to move west–northwestwards, concentrate into a depression and reach near north Tamil Nadu coast by November 11 leading to heavy rainfall in several parts of the state.Chennai saw most of its roads and bylanes and a section of subways remain waterlogged on Monday. Traffic in the city was also diverted creating issues for travellers. More than 23,000 personnel were deployed by the Greater Chennai Corporation amid showers to restore normalcy. Even a police station in Adambakkam was shifted to temporary premises due to flooding.“377 locations were waterlogged. Now only 177 places are stagnated. 169 shelters have been readied and 58 of them are currently occupied,” Greater Chennai Corporation commissioner Gagandeep Bedi said, according to a HT report.People affected by the floods were given food prepared in community kitchens.While transportation was affected due to the rain, the Southern Railway said that all suburban services are running and will run normally.

This was the second such attack on a civilian in the city this week after constable Tawseef Ahmad Wani, 29, was killed in Srinagar’s Batamaloo region on Sunday.The deceased has been identified as Ibrahim Khan of Bandipore district. He was working as a salesman for Kashmiri pandit businessman Roshan Lal Mawa, who had established his business in 2018 in the old city of the Valley.Initially, Khan was shifted to the SMHS hospital in Srinagar but police later confirmed from the hospital that he succumbed to his injuries.The situation has been pretty tense in Jammu and Kashmir since the spate of civilian killings last month wherein as many as 11 migrants were gunned down by terrorists, who mostly belonged to Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).On Sunday, Wani — whose family was paid a visit by Union home minister Amit Shah last month — was gunned down outside his residence, police told Hindustan Times.A police spokesperson said that at around 8pm, terrorists opened fire upon Wani, leaving him with serious bullet injuries. Although he was rushed to a nearby hospital, he later succumbed to his injuries. A case has been filed against the suspects and the J&K Police have formed a team to probe the matter as well. Notably, Wani had joined the police force two years before.Also Read | J&K Police form team to probe constable Tawseef Ahmad Wani’s deathIn the brutal killings that plagued Kashmir last month, a majority of the migrants who were targeted were from Bihar and from minority communities.

08-11-2021||India||‘List reasons for not including petrol, diesel under GST’: Kerala HC tells GST council||The Kerala High Court on Monday asked the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council why petroleum products can’t come under the GST and directed it to file a reply in ten days. Hearing a public interest litigation (PIL), a division bench of Chief Justice S Manikumar and Justice Shaji P Chaly directed the GST Council to explain reasons for not including petrol and diesel within the ambit of GST. The PIL was filed by Kerala Pradesh Gandhi Darshanvadi, a voluntary organisation, though its counsel Arun B Varghese contended that prices of petrol and diesel vary in different states as tax levied by them was different and sought a uniform tax regime for petroleum products. It also cited that though the union and state governments plead helplessness in this citing petroleum marketing companies, both enthusiastically participated in the reduction of fuel price prior to elections. “Now different rates are being charged in different states and same is due to a different rate of tax levied by the state governments under their fragmented taxing policies. This is an impediment to harmonised national market as contemplated under Article 279(A) 6 of the constitution,” the PIL said. It also said the state and central taxes will account for at least 60 per cent of the price of one litre of fuel. If petrol and diesel are brought under the GST, there will be a harmonious market throughout the nation and the maximum taxable rate will be 28%, it said, adding that even people who are not direct consumers of fuel are affected by the unprecedented price hike. “A welfare state must be the one where everyone is in a position to bear expenses of basic amenities. The unprecedented hike in fuel prices push the public to immense hardships by which their right to life guaranteed under Article 21 is violated,” it said.Respondents in the PIL are the Union of India, Kerala Government, Petroleum Secretary, Goods and Service Tax Council and three major oil companies. The Centre and the GST Council can’t argue that if the fuel was included in the GST, it would have serious implications on revenue collection. A constitutional duty was cast upon the GST Council to make a serious recommendation to include both (petrol and diesel) under the GST, the PIL said. “To declare the non-inclusion of petrol and diesel under the GST regime are violative of the Article 14 and 21 of the constitution,” it said. The PIL was first filed in July but it was withdrawn later after the court pointed out some glitches and they were corrected in the new one which was readily admitted by the court, said the counsel. Earlier, the counsel for both union and state governments opposed the PIL saying the fuel price regime was part of a policy decision and the judiciary can’t intervene.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/list-reasons-for-not-including-petrol-diesel-under-gst-kerala-hc-tells-gst-council-101636388822681.html
08-11-2021||India||2 Manipur legislators join BJP, praise PM Modi’s initiatives in the North-east||IMPHAL: Two Manipur legislators elected on a Congress ticket in the 2017 assembly elections, RK Imo Singh and Yamthong Haokip, joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Monday, raising the party’s strength in the 60-member assembly to 25. Manipur is due for elections early next year.RK Imo Singh, who represents the Sagolband constituency in Imphal West district, was expelled from the Congress in August last year for anti-party activities. His father Rajkumar Jaichandra Singh was a former Manipur chief minister and the first Union minister from the state. He’s the son-in-law of chief minister N Biren Singh.Yamthong Haokip was elected from the Saikul assembly segment in Kangpokpi district, and was still with Congress before he turned up at the BJP office in the national capital and switched sides.RK Imo Singh credited Prime Minister Narendra Modi for doing a lot of work for the country’s prosperity, peace and stability. In 2017 when the BJP came to power in Manipur, the state was known for law and order problems, regular blockades and the divide between its hilly and valley regions but this is no longer so, he said at an event to announce the induction of the two Manipur politicians.Union minister Sarbananda Sonowal highlighted PM Modi’s initiatives in the Northeast besides addressing the issues.Sharing group photographs of the two former Congress MLAs with the BJP national leaders in a tweet, chief minister N Biren Singh wrote, “Leaders from various parties continue to join the@BJP4India. Shri Yamthong Haokip Ji, MLA of Saikul AC joined BJP today and took blessings from National Party President Sh @JPNadda Ji & Natl. Gen Sec (Org) Sh @blsantosh Ji.”BJP Manipur also tweeted its welcome note: “We wholeheartedly welcome and congratulate Shri Rajkumar Imo Singh and Shri Yamthong Haokip for Joining the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).”With Yamthong Haokip’s exit, the Congress is down to 15 legislators in the assembly.The Congress won 28 seats in the 2017 elections to emerge as the single largest party but could not come to power since the BJP, which won only 21 seats, was able to cross the majority mark of 31 seats with the support of four lawmakers each from the National People’s Party (NPP) and Naga Peoples Front and one legislator each from the Trinamool Congress, Lok Janshakti Party and an independent MLA.The BJP’s strength in the assembly has gone up since then, mostly at the expense of the Congress.In August last year, five Congress MLAs Henry Okram, nephew of former chief minister and senior Congress leader Ibobi Singh, Paonam Brojen, Oinam Lukhoi Singh, Ngamthang Haokip, Ginsuanhau Zou quit the party and joined the BJP. Former Congress MLA Govindas Konthoujam who was the former Congress unit chief, also joined the ruling BJP on August 1 this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-manipur-legislators-join-bjp-praise-pm-modi-s-initiatives-in-the-northeast-101636387979728.html
08-11-2021||India||Supreme Court notice to Centre for staus check on domestic violence law||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday asked the Centre to respond to a petition seeking information about designating protection officers and shelter homes under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act 2005 for victims.The petition, filed by a non-profit “We the Women of India”, said there were several provisions in the law enacted in 2005 to protect women from violence and abuse at home but hadn’t been completely implemented by many states. For one, the petition filed advocate Shobha Gupta said, “The victims are clueless as to which authority they can approach for counselling or protection due to lack of proper enforcement and dissemination of information to the public at large”.A bench of justices UU Lalit and S Ravindra Bhat issued notice to three departments under the Union Government, Ministry of Women and Child Development, Ministry of Home Affairs and Ministry of Information, and sought their response within four weeks.The bench said it was avoiding issuing notice to states and UTs at this stage to first get a clear picture from the Centre.“We will issue notice to the central government or else it becomes a jamboree and, on each occasion, some state will seek time and the matter will unnecessarily keep getting pushed. Let the Centre file its response. We will get a clear picture of the implementation of the law,” the judges said, posting the matter for hearing on December 6.According to data compiled by the National Crime Records Bureau, over 30% of a total 4.05 lakh crimes registered for crimes against women were registered under the domestic violence law. Between March and September 2020 when a lockdown was in place due to the Covid pandemic, the NCW reported a spike in the number of domestic violence complaints, the petition stated.Shobha said the 2005 Act was enacted to provide succour to women who face domestic violence and the victims could directly approach protection officers with their complaints. The law also provided for shelter homes for the protection of victims of such violence. “For the successful implementation of the Act, contact details of protection officers, shelter homes and service providers should be easily available and should be readily accessible for providing necessary and timely assistance to victims,” she said.The petition said the NCW website contains a list of protection officers of 14 states but no information is provided about service providers or shelter homes. Only Delhi and Manipur have provided details under the three separate heads.According to the petition, each district in every state and union territory should maintain a list of protection officers, service providers and shelter homes and share this information centrally on the website Women and Child Development (WCD) ministry, or the official portals of the National Commission for Women (NCW), State Commissions for Women, or at the local police stations.But this hasn’t been done, the petition said. It also complained that states and union territories were required to publicise various provisions of the law and set up a ‘Network of Assistance’ to assist victims of domestic violence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-notice-to-centre-for-staus-check-on-domestic-violence-law-101636386179635.html

08-11-2021||India||PMC to tar Katraj-Kondhwa road due to financial crunch||PUNE: Due to lack of funds to acquire land for the Katraj-Kondhwa road-widening project, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has decided to complete tarring of the existing road instead of cement concretisation (CC) to avoid inconveniencing citizens.The PMC’s project to widen the Katraj-Kondhwa road by 4km will not be completed within the deadline owing to land acquisition problems. Over a period of three years, the contractor has completed only 25% of the work and the project cost has also increased due to the delay. So, the corporation has decided to complete tarring of the existing road from Kakade vasti to Kondhwa and Shatrunjay mandir to Rajas society instead of cement concretisation. The PMC has also decided to construct a grade separator between Yewalewadi and Kondhwa. The standing committee has approved a proposal of ₹9.76 crore tabled by the road department of the corporation. The PMC has allocated ₹35 crore for the Katraj-Kondhwa road-widening project out of which, ₹9.76 crore will be used to complete tarring of the existing road instead of CC work.Dhananjay Gaikwad, deputy engineer of the road department, said, “At present, the existing road is not in good condition. Local residents were demanding repair and maintenance of the existing road to avoid inconvenience to traffic. Actually, the Katraj-Kondhwa road-widening project includes cement concretisation of the road along with road-widening. However, the project affected people are demanding cash compensation and the cost works out more than the actual project cost. Therefore, the contractor will not be able to complete the project within the December 2021 deadline. Hence, the department has decided to complete tarring of the existing road.”The Katraj-Kondhwa road is one of the major roads that links the Satara road to Solapur road. Heavy traffic passes out of the city via this route from the westerly bypass to Solapur road. However, the road is too narrow (15m to 20m wide) and is always facing logjams along the 4km stretch between Kondhwa and Katraj junction that passes through Khadi machine chowk.Fahim Mulla, a resident of Kondhwa said, “It is a practical decision of the administration to complete tarring of the road instead of CC as PMC does not know when they will get the land for road-widening. The decision is late but I welcome it. At least, we will get some kind of relief and a motorable road.”Only 25% work completeIn December 2018, a PMC-appointed contractor began the work of widening the existing 3.5km Katraj-Kondhwa road (15 to 20m) to 84m. The project cost was ₹215 crore including GST. The deadline was fixed as December 2021.However, nearly three years since, the contractor has completed only 25% of the work as the PMC is not able to hand over the land required for road-widening. The contractor has completed road-widening work in patches wherever land was made available for the purpose of widening.PMC needs ₹700 crore for land acquisitionAccording to PMC road department officials, land acquisition will cost the administration ₹700 crore. Due to the financial crunch, it is not possible for the PMC to pay such a big amount as compensation.Earlier, the PMC decided to implement the road-widening project with the deferred payment option - temporary postponement of the payment of an outstanding bill or debt, usually involving repayment by instalments. But, the PMC realised that they would have to pay an additional ₹100 crore to the contractor if they opted for the deferred payment mode. Hence, the option was discarded by the standing committee of the PMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pmc-to-tar-katraj-kondhwa-road-due-to-financial-crunch-101636381139683.html

We trust you will ensure that the process of settling arrears is righteously carried out so as to not leave the employees feeling cheated. We are truly optimistic about making a fresh start with our new owners. We urge you not to exploit us employees whilst settling our arrears as that would probably lead to mass protest and industrial unrest just as the company changes hands”. The letter by the IPG, read, “..the government is committed to settling all outstanding dues with employees pre hand-over.” Asking the airline to not miss certain points whilst implementing the said process, the pilots mentioned the 2006 wage agreement which allocated a monthly Layover Subsistence Allowance (LSA) for pilots and co-pilots.LSA was an allowance provided to sustain international layovers where the cost of living is higher. But, pilots would spend from their own pockets on international layovers because these sums of money were not rightfully paid on time.“Over the years, 25% of these amounts were held back and are still due,” the pilots said. The reimbursement of these foreign currency expenses that have been incurred for many years is overdue,” they stated. Pilots mentioned that the arrears arising out of the 25% cut on LSA are due, when these arrears are settled, there should be no question of any tax burden on the pilots. Additionally, a unilateral 25% pay cut had been implemented on Air India employees in 2012. “It has been over nine years since the first deduction and it would be highly unjust if the company were to have enjoyed interest-free finance at the expense of the employees,” the letter read. The IPG also sought an immediate detailed statement with a working calculation of dues pending for each pilot. In October, Tata Sons emerged as the highest bidder for the purchase of the debt-ridden state-run airline Air India, with a proposal of ₹18,000 crore and became the new owner of Air India after beating Ajay Singh, chairman, SpiceJet.Commenting on the letter, a senior pilot said that despite the official announcement on sorting all the issues relating to arrears, the airline has not had a word on it. “It will be shameful if the airline cuts taxes on our arrears. We hope the airline does justice to the employees and pays back our arrears in full before the new owner takes over, else we will be forced to take drastic steps.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-india-boeing-pilots-warn-of-mass-protest-on-non-payment-of-arrears-101636377899715.html

The density could be as high as 1.06 per 10 man-hours, which also means the Aedes mosquito or its larvae could be found in 2-3% of houses, said health officials aware of the findings. During the monsoon soon, the health department had found that the density has been 0.93 per 10 man-hours. Last year, the density was 0.660 per 10 man-hours or one in 200 houses, said the officials, adding that this shows that the breeding of Aedes mosquitoes has substantially increased in one year. Three years ago, the mosquito was responsible for the worst outbreak of dengue in Kanpur, which had recorded around 900 deaths. Also Read: Indonesian researchers breed ‘good’ mosquitoes to combat dengueAccording to the malaria control department’s report, which was seen by HT, two species - Aedes Aegypti and Albopictus – have the highest concentration in Kanpur. The malaria-causing Anopheles mosquito has a density of 0.025 per 10 man-hours, which means it has been found in one in 400 houses, the report said. While the Culex mosquito that causes Filaria has zero-density in urban pockets, it has a density of 0.012 per 10 man-hours in rural pockets of Kanpur, such as in Ghatampur and Sarsaul. Kanpur division’s additional director for health, Dr GK Mishra, said the Aedes mosquito has become dominant and its density in Chakeri was a cause for concern, particularly after genome sequencing confirmed the presence of the Zika virus’s RNA in one of the mosquito samples sent to NMRI in New Delhi. “It is acknowledgment that mosquitoes are carrying the Zika virus in Chakeri,” said chief medical officer, Dr Nepal Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/experts-find-unprecedented-density-of-aedes-mosquitoes-in-kanpur-s-chakeri-101636375318885.html
08-11-2021||India||'Speed of expansion of certain maritime presence triggering new arms race'||Defence secretary Ajay Kumar on Monday hit out, without directly naming China, for what he said was an ‘expansion at an unprecedented rate’ of conventional navies in the Pacific region which he said was prompting “new genre of arms race” whose effects were being felt far beyond the region. Speaking at the inaugural event of the Goa Maritime Conclave, hosted by the Indian Navy, currently underway in Goa and being attended by the naval heads of 12 Indian Ocean countries, Kumar also made a special reference to “illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing, being undertaken in International waters off the coast of India, calling for action against the practice -- something that Chinese boats have been accused of. The theme for this year’s edition of GMC is “Maritime Security and Emerging Non-Traditional Threats: A Case for Proactive Role for IOR Navies” and included threats like terrorism, narcotics, piracy, human and drug trafficking besides also IUU fishing. “While we talk of non-traditional threats, we cannot ignore the impact of expansion at an unprecedented speed of conventional navies in the Pacific. We are also witnessing the enhancement of certain maritime presence in passages in our region that do not always seem innocent. The negative effects of such expansion are felt beyond the pacific. Though it is early to conclude, such expansion has triggered others to acquire traditional capabilities and thus to start a new genre of arms race,” Kumar told the gathering that also included foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla, the Chief of Naval Staff Vice Admiral Karambir Singh and a host of delegates from the thirteen countries of the region. “India will work with all marine nations for peace in the region, standing for a rules-based world, India will continue to oppose the tenets of aggression on land and on the sea. Maritime domain is so vast and strategies are so diverse that going alone is not an option. India remains engaged in most of the important exercises and activities in the Indo-Pacific and the Western IOR for a long time,” he added. “I would like to make special reference to the illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing which undermines national and regional efforts to achieve the goals of long term sustainability and responsibility. Moreover, IUU fishing greatly discriminates against those who act responsibly, honestly and in accordance with rules. IUU fishing, mostly from outside our region, is threatening marine biodiversity, food security for communities and the livelihoods of those involved in fishing,” Kumar said.“In order for our nations to achieve high growth, it is imperative we secure a free open and inclusive maritime region where legitimate interests of all nationals must be protected. For a secure and prosperous region, it is not only important to adhere to international rules and laws but also it is a necessity to understand each other’s interests and sensitivity and act accordingly. India hopes that its maritime neighbours would understand and are sensitive to India’s legitimate maritime security concerns,” he added. Fishermen from India’s west coast, including fishermen from Goa and Maharashtra, have complained of predatory and environmentally damaging practises undertaken by Chinese fishing boats deep into the Arabian Sea which they say is spelling ruin for their livelihoods. The 3rd edition of Goa Maritime Conclave (GMC) – 2021 is being held from November 7 to 9 under the aegis of Naval War College, Goa. The GMC is Indian Navy’s Outreach Initiative providing a multinational platform to harness the collective wisdom of practitioners of maritime security and the academia towards garnering outcome-oriented maritime thought.Chiefs of Navies/heads of maritime forces from 12 Indian Ocean littorals, including Bangladesh, Comoros, Indonesia, Madagascar, Malaysia, Maldives, Mauritius, Myanmar, Seychelles, Singapore, Sri Lanka and Thailand are in attendance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/speed-of-expansion-of-certain-maritime-presence-triggering-new-arms-race-defence-secretary-101636374299417.html

Bharat Biotech supplies its vaccine at 150 rupees a dose, while Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, the supplier of Sputnik V, has priced the shot at 995 rupees.The 265 rupee price had been decided in consultation with the government, Zydus said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-purchase-10-mn-doses-of-zydus-cadila-s-vaccine-at-about-rs-265-each-101636372361530.html

Rao, also known as KCR, further said the BJP branded anyone who spoke against the ruling camp at the Centre as anti-nationals.Rao, who heads the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS), further wanted to know about the Narendra Modi-led government’s promise of two crore jobs at a time when his administration provided employment to 1.35 lakh people and another 70,000 would be employed soon.The CM also alleged that people of Telangana were being ignored for the Padma awards. “The Centre is not giving Padma awards to people of our state, they’re are ignoring us,” he said.“When I don’t support them (BJP) they brand me as anti-national. BJP also brands people as urban Naxals if they speak against them. I'm asking a simple question will Centre buy the state's parboiled rice or not?,” he was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.We've provided jobs to 1.35 lakh people in the state and 70,000 more jobs will be given. According to the studies, the unemployment rate in Telangana is low.

According to the studies, the unemployment rate in Telangana is low. What about the Centre's promise of providing 2 Cr jobs?” he added.Rao’s statements came amid a severe attack from the state BJP unit over Rao’s decision to not reduce VAT on fuel in the state. On Sunday, the chief minister said the BJP had no moral right to ask states to reduce VAT on petrol and diesel and demanded that the NDA government at the Centre remove cess on the petroleum products.He further said the TRS will organise dharnas in all assembly constituencies on November 12, with lakhs of farmers demanding the Central government to procure entire Kharif (summer or monsoon crop) paddy produced in Telangana.On Sunday, he hit out at the state BJP leadership who announced agitational programmes against the TRS government for discouraging farmers not to go for paddy cultivation this Rabi season. He said it was the Centre which is not willing to procure paddy from the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/when-i-don-t-support-bjp-i-m-branded-anti-national-telangana-cm-kcr-101636371412163.html

08-11-2021||India||BJP MPs visit Yamuna river ghats to assess Chhath Puja arrangements||Opposing the ban on Chhath Puja celebrations on the banks of the Yamuna river, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MPs Parvesh Verma and Manoj Tiwari visited various ghats on Monday to assess the situation and plan arrangements for the festival. They said that chief minister Arvind Kejriwal does not want people to celebrate the festival and slammed the Delhi government for the high level of pollution in the river.Verma performed puja at the ITO ghat on Monday and said that all necessary arrangements will be made for November 10 festival. Tiwari visited Kalindi Kunj and planned a meeting of Chhath Puja committee members at Yamuna ghat in Sonia Vihar to discuss the arrangements.Verma said, “Members of the Purvanchal community voted for Arvind Kejriwal in Delhi elections and made him the chief minister, but today he (Kejriwal) is stopping them from celebrating their festival. He should have got the entire Delhi administration to make elaborate arrangements for the festival. He does not want people to celebrate this festival. But now we will make the ghat for people and do puja on November 10.”Also Read: No cap on gatherings at Chhath Puja begins in ChandigarhThe Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) has prohibited Chhath Puja on the banks of the Yamuna this year. Earlier, on September 30, DDMA banned the celebrations, but later allowed it with restrictions following protests by the BJP and the appeals to the Centre by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, and to the lieutenant governor Anil Baijal by Kejriwal.Tiwari has been vocal against the ban. Durga puja and Dussehra celebrations were allowed but Chhath Puja was banned by DDMA in September. He mobilised the purvanchali community and held yatras in various parts of the city to galvanise support.In a tweet, he criticised the government while citing images of the river near Kalindi Kunj covered in a thick layer of toxic foam. “The permission for Chhath puja was denied at the banks of Yamuna as this would have exposed the government.”Tiwari said, “Had the government allowed it, we would have cleaned the ghats and made arrangements for people. The river is polluted and the government has done nothing to clean it.”The BJP’s Delhi unit tweeted, “Devotees performing Chhat Puja forced to take dip in toxic Yamuna. This is what Arvind Kejriwal has reduced Delhi to. This is his commitment towards providing facilities to those who celebrate the festival. Shame.”HT has reached out to the Delhi government for a comment and the copy will be updated accordingly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-mps-visit-yamuna-river-ghats-to-assess-chhath-puja-arrangements-101636370459545.html

The exact details and conditions are not available yet,” said Ashok Saikia’s brother, Debabrata Saikia, the leader of opposition in the Assam assembly.Ashok Saikia was arrested from his residence in Guwahati. His family said the case pertains to a ₹9.37 lakh loan that Ashok Saikia had taken from the Assam State Cooperative And Rural Development Bank in 1996.The bank registered a case against Saikia in 1998 for non-repayment. The case was later transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation’s Kolkata office the same year.In his bail plea, Ashok Sakia said in 2015, the dues were settled.The Congress blamed the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party-led government for foisting fake and fabricated cases. “Despite Saikia clearing all pending dues with the bank in 2015, he was arrested on Sunday. This is a clear indication of the government using the country’s top investigating agency to further its political ends. They are doing this because of Debabrata Saikia’s refusal to switch over to BJP despite inducements and threats,” said state Congress chief Bhupen Kumar Borah.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-assam-chief-minister-s-son-gets-bail-in-bank-fraud-case-101636369677753.html

Two other probes, one by the Kumbh Mela administration and another by the district administration, were already on.Also Read: India logs 11,451 new Covid cases, 266 deaths; active cases lowest in 262 daysThe Pants are partners in the Max Corporate Services, which got the contract for Covid-19 testing of pilgrims, tourists, and local residents during Mahakumbh this year. SIT carried out searches and raids at possible hiding places of the Pants in Noida and Delhi before their arrest.The Kumbh Mela was curtailed this year but devotees thronged Haridwar for months despite experts saying the crowds and rampant violation of Covid protocol could spark a surge in infections. Roughly 9.1 million pilgrims took the holy dip in the Ganga from January 14 to April 27. The bulk of this — at least six million people — congregated in April, coinciding with the worst surge in the second wave of the pandemic.Allegations of fake testing surfaced after a Faridkot resident complained to the authorities that he received a message for collecting his Covid-19 report despite never having been tested. The complaint triggered a probe that unearthed roughly 100,000 fake rapid antigen tests.Real-time data checking exposed fake entries on basis of mobile numbers and addresses of people who were never tested. On contacting such people, many said they had not even visited Haridwar in April.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sit-arrests-prime-accused-over-fake-covid-19-testing-scam-at-mahakumbh-101636369197526.html

Last year, the winter session could not be held due to the onslaught of the pandemic, which had witnessed the curtailment of the Budget and the Monsoon sessions. This time, the session will have about 20 sittings. The session is likely to be stormy with the Opposition all set to corner the Narendra Modi-led government on issues like inflation, militant attacks on civilians in Kashmir, the Lakhimpur Kheri violence and the farmers' protests against three centrally passed agri laws.Both Houses of Parliament -- Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha - will hold proceedings simultaneously and members would have to follow social distancing norms.Those attending the proceedings, including members of Parliament, would be required to wear masks and may also be asked to undergo a Covid-19 test before the commencement of the session.This year's Monsoon Session was marked by protests by the Opposition that sought answers from the government over the Pegasus spyware issue and repeal of the three farm laws. The session was curtailed and adjourned sine die two days ahead of its scheduled adjournment due to the protests."The CCPA chaired by defence minister Rajnath Singh has recommended the dates for the Winter Session of Parliament from November 29 to December 23," PTI had earlier quoted a source as saying.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/winter-session-of-parliament-from-nov-29-to-dec-23-with-covid-protocol-in-place-101636368750707.html

The party’s state unit carried out rallies against the chief minister’s visit and also burnt his effigies, according to a report by news agency PTI.The rally started from Rajmahal Square to Naveen Nivas, the residence of Patnaik. The party held rallies in several districts of the state against the chief minister’s scheduled visit, alleging that he has been “silent” over the incident of murder. The party has been protesting against the murder and has also demanded the resignation of Odisha’s minister of state for home DS Mishra over the incident.The protests were held by BJP members in districts including Cuttack, Bhadrak, Subarnapur, Dhenkanal and Kalahandi.Also read | Congress, BJP push for Odisha minister’s sacking, say new evidence indicts himMeanwhile, Odisha BJP spokesperson Dilip Mohanty said that Patnaik was visiting the district a month after the incident and has also not said anything. “A minister from CM Naveen Patnaik's government has murdered a woman. The entire media is covering this issue. We are demanding that justice be given. But the CM hasn't said anything on this case. It has been a month since the murder and now he is coming to Kalahandi,” news agency ANI quoted Mohanty as saying.“What message is he trying to give? Why so much arrogance? Family members of the victim, people in the district and women in Odisha are worried. He has not arrested the minister either,” he added.Kasturi Mishra, the women wing president of the party’s state unit claimed that Mishra had destroyed all evidence relating to the case. "The chief minister says that the law will take its course. But how will it take its course when the evidence relating to the case has been destroyed?” she asked.“Today, a month has been completed since the murder and the Chief Minister has not said anything on the matter. After destroying the evidence, Mishra went to Kalahandi to show the people that he is innocent. We are protesting so that the truth is exposed. Till Mamita does not get justice, we will continue with our protests and chakka jams," she further said.Earlier on October 8, Odisha police discovered the partially burnt body of 24-year old Mamita Meher near a sports stadium in Kalahandi. Previously, the teacher, who was teaching in a school in Mahalinga in the district, had gone missing.Amid the protest, the BJP’s national president JP Nadda in late October formed a three-member panel - Lok Sabha MP Sunita Duggal, BJP women wing president Vanathi Srinivasan and MLA Rupra Mitra. - regarding the case.(With ANI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamita-meher-murder-case-bjp-holds-protests-in-odisha-against-naveen-patnaik-s-visit-to-kalahandi-101636367481571.html

In 2018, Kanimozhi participated in a DMK-led protest in Villupuram where she had criticised the then CM Palaniswami. The DMK, which formed the government in May, was in the Opposition at that time. A defamation case was filed against Kanimozhi in the Villupuram district court for hurling corruption charges at Palaniswami in connection with waste disposal.Kanimozhi later approached the high court and filed a quash petition in 2019. In her petition, she argued that she was misquoted and a complaint was filed against her based on hearsay from two witnesses who had attended her speech. Also Read: Stalin reaches out to indigenous communities after tribal woman is barred from having food at templeShe had listed the “gross failures of the government, its corruption and non-adherence to poll promises,” in her speech, she said in her affidavit. In her petition, she argued that no public servant had absolute immunity from criticism from the Opposition and public.“Palaniswami filed a criminal complaint through the public prosecutor,” said the DMK’s Rajya Sabha MP and senior advocate P Wilson, who appeared for Kanimozhi. He claimed that the public prosecutor’s office was being misused to file cases against rivals for political gains. Justice Nirmal Kumar of Madras high court quashed the case on Monday. After the DMK came to power, chief minister M K Stalin ordered the withdrawal of all defamation cases filed by the earlier government. “Pursuant to the same, the high court recorded the withdrawal order of the government and quashed the complaint against Kanimozhi,” said Wilson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madras-high-court-quashes-defamation-case-against-dmk-leader-kanimozhi-101636367637795.html

The remark by Ramesh came on the fifth anniversary of demonetisation, which was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on this day in 2016.The veteran Congress leader also claimed that demonetisation, along with a “rushed” goods and services tax, "destroyed the backbone of the Indian economy"."With every passing year, it is becoming even more clear that 8.11.2016 will be marked in the world's economic history among the worst policy blunders anywhere. Demonetisation along with rushed GST destroyed the backbone of the Indian economy -- the MSME and informal sectors especially," Ramesh said in a tweet.Also read | On 5 years of demonetisation, TMC MP says only Mamata got it spot onJairam Ramesh also shared a graph by former chief economic adviser Arvind Subramanian which was titled "Despite digital boom, cash is back with a vengeance"."First, we were told that demonetisation meant a cashless economy. Soon the 'sarvagyani' changed track and said not cashless but less cash. Now, cash in circulation is above pre-demonetisation levels," Ramesh said as he continued his tirade against the Prime Minister.Modi in a televised address to the nation on November 8, 2016, declared ₹500 and ₹1,000 banknotes invalid as part of the government's efforts to "crack down on black money."Earlier in the day, several parties questioned the demonetisation move by the Centre. CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury alleged that it "decimated the informal sector"."Economy into a tailspin, the poorest hurt. Informal sector decimated. No black money recovered, but rich got richer. Cash in the economy is the highest ever now! This govt must bear responsibility for pushing India downhill, just for one man’s whim," he said in a tweet.Maharashtra cabinet minister Nawab Malik also slammed the Centre over demonetisation, saying neither black money came nor corruption has been controlled in five years while the rate of unemployment increased."Today, 5 years of demonetisation have been completed. Neither black money came back, nor corruption and terrorism were controlled. Modi had asked for 3 months, now he can tell us which crossroads we have to come," Malik tweeted in Hindi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/among-worst-policy-blunders-jairam-ramesh-on-5th-anniversary-of-demonetisation-101636363783106.html

08-11-2021||India||Indian Ocean region: Shringla calls for greater cooperation for security, trade||Countries in the Indian Ocean region need a new cooperative architecture for their common maritime space to ensure both security and free trade, foreign secretary Harsh Shringla said on Monday.The Covid-19 pandemic and new threats have highlighted the need to work together and come up with common solutions, and India stands ready to do its share to tackle these issues, he said while speaking at the Goa Maritime Conclave on the theme “Maritime security and emerging non-traditional threats: A case for proactive role for IOR navies”.Harsh Shringla noted that the prosperity and well-being of people of countries in the region are built on a foundation of law-and-order and security, and said, “A new cooperative architecture for our common maritime space that ensures security for its inhabitants, driven by our realities, and our aspirations to lead better lives, is necessary to grasp this opportunity.”Also Read: Theaterisation of forces expedited, deadline advancedWhile security in the context of foreign policy was traditionally associated with countering external security threats, countries in the region are now having to contend with non-traditional and sub-conventional threats that require new solutions, he said. “We now operate on the basis of an expanded concept of human security that takes a broader view,” he said.Navies, coast guard forces and maritime security agencies of the region need to do more together since all problems that will arise cannot be anticipated, he added. “India stands ready and willing to do its share – and more – in tackling these problems,” Shringla said.The Indian Ocean region’s countries can work on strengthening structures, understandings, procedures and resources so that they better manage problems. “It will also enable us to create a surge capacity to deal with the unknown,” he said.The pandemic has led to a rebalancing that has resulted in a dispersal of capacities, including for Indian Ocean nations. “Every one of us present here have a growing ability to come up with common solutions to common problems. That means we are able to do more together,” he added. Referring to the changes brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic, Harsh Shringla said countries were in the process of devising new solutions. “We are in the process of devising a new set of measures and arrangements that reflect this understanding of security. They are based less on the traditional concept of a military alliance and more on a cooperative approach, on prevention, on sharing of information, and, on promoting inter-operability across state borders,” he said.Many of these cooperative activities are in the areas of policing and law enforcement, and more appropriate to the “newer and rapidly evolving threat matrix”, he noted.Among the non-traditional and sub-conventional security threats and problems listed by Shringla were transnational crime syndicates engaged in human trafficking, smuggling and narcotics, irresponsible fishing that damages food security, maritime accidents that lead to pollution, and natural disasters that affect coastal economic and population centres. Coastal population centres, Shringla noted, are also “targets for terrorists, supported and encouraged by the resources of governments”. He added, “Using the oceans to move and infiltrate, they threaten offshore and coastal assets. Such terrorists tend to combine with transnational criminals. These alliances escalate instability and violence levels exponentially.”In an apparent reference to China’s aggressive maritime activities especially in the South China Sea, Shringla said, “Another set of challenges arises from geopolitical volatilities. A lack of commitment to settled international law has led to an increased militarisation of the region. Militarisation always adds to complexities.”The Indian Ocean region, he said, will face an “increasingly complicated, rapidly evolving, and more demanding security situation, with an ever increasing battery of threats and uncertainties”. Noting that the time for forging a cooperative approach to threats and problems is limited, he said countries in the region must work swiftly “as fellow travellers in a voyage... to ride these momentarily favourable tides and currents”. Shringla added, “If we are able to do so, we in the Indian Ocean Region, through common effort, may be able to set ourselves on a trajectory to improved futures.”The countries of the Indian Ocean region are also part of the greater Indo-Pacific, “a contemporary geopolitical and geoeconomic reality” that is at the centre of the ongoing rebalancing. “The rapid growth of Asia’s share in global output, the business prowess of Asian companies and the growing Asian technological abilities are driving the global economic center of gravity to the East,” Shringla said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-ocean-region-shringla-calls-for-greater-cooperation-for-security-trade-101636360376595.html

The classes will be held alternately for five days a week, according to a government order.Karnataka began reopening educational institutes in a phased manner from August. The government has been encouraging parents and guardians of students to send them back to schools after the Covid-19 pandemic-induced lockdown forced the closure of educational institutes over 18 months ago.“...teachers aged above 50 years should compulsorily wear a face shield,” according to the guidelines issued by the government for the reopening of schools.The schools have reopened as the new infections in Karnataka appear to have reduced. But there has been a spike in infections in neighbouring Kerala and Maharashtra.Private schools had been asking the government to reopen schools. A section of parents and guardians are still unsure about sending their children to school. They fear closed spaces will become breeding grounds for the virus and heighten the threat, especially since school students fall under the age group that is yet to be eligible for vaccination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-pre-primary-classes-resume-in-person-in-karnataka-101636359356484.html

But Darul officials, including Maulana Abul Qasim Nomani, vice chancellor of the Deoband centre, refused to meet him.Ashraf Usmani said that Owaisi and all other leaders of political parties could freely visit the Deoband seminary during the election season, but Darul officials will neither welcome them nor meet them.“They can come [to the seminary in Deoband], have a look around Darul, but can’t meet office bearers during election season,” said Usmani.The seminary’s stance brings back memories of Samajwadi Party (SP) leader Mulayam Singh Yadav having once famously visited the Darul Uloom Deoband during the time of rector Maulana Magrubur Rahman. A photo of the rector showing his hand placed on Yadav’s head had sparked talk of the seminary’s support for the SP. Darul later denied such an association, calling it merely a welcome gesture during Yadav’s visit. Usmani said that none of the political leaders in UP have so far proposed to visit the seminary as they were aware of its stand on politics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wont-entertain-political-leaders-during-up-election-season-darul-uloom-deoband-101636355636151.html

Its leaders do so by paying homage in front of a bust of Vladimir Lenin, the former Soviet leader who once headed the Bolshevik Party, at the CPI(M)’s headquarters in New Delhi. That bust ironically also remains a reminder of the fall of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) and Lenin’s shattered dreams.The bust ended up at the CPI(M)’s headquarters ahead of the disintegration of the USSR in 1991 from its embassy in New Delhi. As it became clear that the USSR’s days were numbered, the embassy officials panicked. “Then CPI(M) Politburo leader Sitaram Yechury was at a get-together at the embassy when the diplomats expressed concern on what to do with the statute if the republic (USSR) disintegrates. Yechury wasted no time and offered to keep it in the party office,” said a CPI(M) leader, who did not want to be named.See photos: Leftover monuments question Lenin’s waning legacyThe bust, carved out of white marble, was packed off a few days later to AK Gopalan Bhawan, the party’s headquarters.“A few days later, Yechury got another call saying that a portrait, too, needs to be disposed of,” said the leader.The life-size portrait of Lenin arrived soon. The bust remains at the gate of the CPI(M)’s central office while the portrait adorns Yechury’s office between former Argentine revolutionary Che Guevara and late CPI(M) leader Harkishan Singh Surjeet’s photos.Lenin’s bust has become integral to the CPI (M) commemoration of the October Revolution, which is observed on November 7 as the first military parade took place on that day to mark its second anniversary.On Sunday, November 7, CPI(M) leaders including Hannan Mollah and Nilotpal Basu paid tributes in front of the bust.The CPI(M)’s base has shrunk drastically in India except for Kerala, which it rules. In the Bengal assembly polls this year, the party, which had ruled the state for 34 years, failed to win even a single seat. From 61 Lok Sabha seats in 2004, the Left parties now have just six members in the House.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-lenin-s-bust-ended-up-at-cpi-m-s-headquarters-in-delhi-101636351855676.html

Why hasn't black money come back? Why hasn't the economy gone cashless? Why hasn't terrorism been hit? Why hasn't price rise been reined in?"CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said demonetisation "decimated the informal sector". "Economy into a tailspin, the poorest hurt.

08-11-2021||India||Campaign plans to Covid-19: Five takeaways from BJP’s national executive summit||As the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) national executive on Sunday held its first meeting after the 2019 general elections, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the key session and took a swipe at family-run parties.Saying that the BJP does not revolve around a family-centric set-up, PM Narendra Modi spelt out that “sewa (service), sankalp (resolution) and samarpan (commitment)” continue to be the core values of his party.Sunday’s event was also the BJP national executive’s first meeting after the Covid-19 pandemic was declared in early 2020.A total of 342 members of the national executive committee, the apex policy-making body of the BJP, attended the summit.Here is a list of five most important takeaways from the meeting of the BJP top brass:1.Political resolution passedUttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath proposed the need for a “political resolution” to ensure victory in the upcoming assembly elections in seven states. “There is a specific mention that we shall ensure victory in the upcoming elections,” finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said regarding the 18-point resolution that was passed in the meeting.The resolution praised PM Narendra Modi’s leadership and accused the Opposition of “opportunism” and a mindset of “extreme hate”.Also Read: PM Modi, senior leaders wish LK Advani; visit his home to celebrate birthdayThe resolution also slammed Bengal’s ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) for having allegedly “sponsored violence” against BJP workers in the state and vowed to ensure justice through legal means.The political resolution was seconded by Tamil Nadu’s BJP president K Annamalai.Six BJP leaders - tourism ministers G Kishan Reddy, Manipur CM N Biren Singh, sports minister Anurag Thakur, Goa CM Pramod Sawant, railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, and Uttarakhand CM Pushkar Singh Dhami - also spoke on the political resolution.2.Campaign plans for state pollsThe chief ministers and state BJP presidents of four poll-bound states – Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Goa, and Manipur – gave a presentation on the coming assembly elections.A similar presentation was given by the BJP’s Punjab president Ashwani Sharma, who announced that the party will contest in all 117 seats in the state’s 2022 polls. BJP president JP Nadda urged party members to set up a “party committee” for every polling booth. He also asked for more arrangements for the broadcast of PM Narendra Modi’s outreach programme Mann Ki Baat at every booth, according to an ANI report.Home minister Amit Shah also addressed the matter, urging party workers to set up committees in all the 1.04 million polling booths in the country by December 25, with special attention to states where polls are due next year. The party has also been asked to appoint “panna pramukhs” at all these booths by April 6, 2022.The seven states slated to go to polls are Goa, Manipur, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat.3.Tackling Covid-19 pandemicThe party lauded the Centre’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, calling the mobilisation of medical support “commendable”. “While lauding the commendable work of vaccination done in India, we also remember how the Opposition parties had raised many questions on vaccination carried by the government from the very beginning,” said Sitharaman after the summit. The party hailed the government for achieving the target of 100 crore vaccinations and its scheme that gave free food grains to 80 crore people.4.Article 370, CAA and NRCWhile briefing the media after the executive meeting, Nirmala Sitharaman said, “We discussed how after the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, the DDC (district development council) and BDC (block development council) elections showed how people were willing to participate in democratic processes.”5.Protest against farm lawsThe BJP is said to have discussed the work done by the Central government in the field of agriculture despite an ongoing protests by farmers over three farm laws passed last year.Referring to the ongoing farmers’ protest at and around New Delhi, Sitharaman said, “We are open for talks. Please tell us what you are opposed to in the laws. We have not been told what the objection is and their (the farmers) story is incomplete. We are still willing to listen to the farmers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/campaign-plans-to-covid-19-five-takeaways-from-bjp-s-national-executive-summit-101636350655645.html
08-11-2021||India||Afghan conference is against radicalisation and terror, not Taliban||Even though Pakistan and China, by not attending the Afghanistan conference here on Wednesday are trying to portray India as anti-Taliban, the actual purpose is to stabilise strife-torn Kabul so that rising Islamic radicalisation does not mutate into global jihad and threaten the region and beyond. The Afghanistan conference is hosted by Indian National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS) headed by National Security Advisor Ajit Doval.Pakistan National Security Advisor Moeed Yusuf has publicly called India a spoiler in Afghanistan and decided against attending the conference. There is no word from China, which has backed Pakistan’s overt and covert role in Afghanistan, on attending the conference. The conference is being attended by Russia with Nikolai Patrushev, Secretary, Security Council of Russia, and right-hand man of President Putin, leading the delegation along with representatives from Iran, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan.According to officials handling the conference, its purpose is not to resurrect any opposition to the Taliban regime but to stabilise Afghanistan with so-called Islamic State of Khorasan Province (ISKP) wreaking violence against Shias and other non-Sunni minorities in the country and Al Qaeda showing signs of revival. The biggest fear posed by unstable Afghanistan under the influence of Pakistani deep state is that the drought prone lawless country may descend into total chaos and turn into a hub of global jihad. While Russia is worried about the security threat to Central Asian Republics, Iran is concerned about rising Pakistani interference and persecution of Shias on both sides of the Durand Line. New Delhi is disturbed about the rising radicalisation in the Indian sub-continent.Nearly three months after capture of Kabul by the Taliban, no country has recognised the Sunni Pashtun force whose sword arm is Pakistani ISI backed Haqqani network (HQN). There is hardly any governance in Kabul with Mullah Yaqoob faction at odds with Sirajuddin Haqqani, who heads the HQN, and all the commitments promised by the Taliban as part of Doha deal have been thrown into Kabul River. The minorities specially women are under vicious attack by the ultra-conservative radicals roaming around the country with state-of-the-art US weaponry.The situation is so dire in Afghanistan that even Pakistan Army Chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa is worried about the jihadist ideology spillover from across the Durand Line and threaten Islamabad itself. It is quite evident that the Pakistan Army has difference of views with the civilian leadership under Prime Minister Imran Khan, who feels that the jihadist forces in Afghanistan will serve the political purpose of Islamabad against India and buy much required economic leverage from the west. The tussle between two power centers in Pakistan may manifest either before the appointment of new DG ISI Lt Gen Nadeem Anjum on November 20 or in the coming three months.Pakistan’s principal backer China is engaging the Taliban regime directly and through Islamabad so that terrorist groups in Afghanistan do not ally with Uighur terrorist groups to threaten Xi Jinping regime in bordering Xinjiang province through Wakhan corridor. The other reason for supporting the Taliban is to promote the Belt Road Initiative in Afghanistan and more importantly ensure that CPEC projects are not targeted by affiliated Sunni Deobandi groups like Tehreek-e-Taliban, Pakistan. In this context, China is guided by the Pakistani line on Afghanistan given the influence ISI exerts on a section of the Taliban regime in Kabul.India may be upset with the ISI influence on Kabul but its over-riding concern is stability of Afghanistan even with Taliban heading the government. An unstable Kabul will not only spell disaster for the Indian sub-continent but also the world at large as the Af-Pak region will yet again produce terrorists on an industrial scale.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/afghan-conference-is-against-radicalisation-and-terror-not-taliban-101636348552852.html

08-11-2021||India||French journal Mediapart claims new evidence of kickbacks in Rafale deal||Mediapart, a French online journal, on Sunday published alleged fake invoices that it claimed enabled French aircraft maker Dassault Aviation to pay at least €7.5 million in kickbacks to a middleman to help it secure the ₹59,000 crore deal with India for 36 Rafale fighter jets. It added that despite the existence of documents, Indian agencies decided not to pursue the case.“It involves offshore companies, dubious contracts and ‘false’ invoices. Mediapart can reveal that detectives from India’s federal police force, the Central Bureau of Investigations (CBI), and colleagues from the Enforcement Directorate (ED), which fights money laundering, have had proof since October 2018 that Dassault paid at least €7.5 million in secret commissions to middleman Sushen Gupta,” Mediapart said in a report.Five months ago, Mediapart reported that a French judge was appointed to head a probe into suspected “corruption and favouritism” in the deal. In a report in April 2021, the online journal claimed that it was in possession of documents that showed Dassault and its industrial partner Thales, a defence electronics firm, paid “middleman” Gupta several million euros in “secret commissions” in connection with the deal.Watch: Wing Commander Abhinandan, who shot down Pak F-16, promoted as Group CaptainAccording to the April report, the bulk of the payments were made before 2013. “According to an accounts spreadsheet belonging to Sushen Gupta, an entity called simply ‘D’, which is a code he regularly used to designate Dassault, paid €14.6 million to Interdev in Singapore over the period 2004-2013,” the report said. It said Interdev was a shell company with no real activity and administered by a straw man for the Gupta family.The report said according to another accounts spreadsheet belonging to Gupta, which only covers the years 2004 to 2008, Thales paid €2.4 million to another shell company.In another report in April, Mediapart claimed that Dassault paid €1 million to Gupta for manufacturing 50 large replica models of Rafale jets, even though the planemaker provided inspectors of French anti-corruption agency Agence Française Anticorruption no proof that these models were made.India’s decision to sign an $8.7 billion government-to-government deal with France to buy 36 Rafale warplanes made by Dassault was announced in April 2015, with an agreement signed a little over a year later. This replaced the previous Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government’s decision to buy 126 Rafale aircraft, 108 of which were to be made in India by the state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL).The deal became controversial. The Opposition, led by the Congress, claimed that the price at which India was buying Rafale aircraft now is ₹1,670 crores for each, three times the initial bid of ₹526 crores by the company when the UPA was trying to buy the aircraft. It also claimed the previous deal included a technology transfer agreement with HAL.HT has not reviewed any of the documents cited by Mediapart.The UPA deal, struck in 2012, was not a viable one, the then defence minister Manohar Parrikar maintained, implying that it would have never been closed and that, therefore, any comparison is moot. The UPA was not able to close the deal till 2014, largely over discussions related to the pricing of items not included in the initial bid.The government has said that it cannot disclose the details of the price because of a confidentiality agreement with France, and the strategic reason of not showing its hand to India’s enemies. It said that the current deal also includes customised weaponry.The Supreme Court heard a public interest case on the deal and in November 2019, said it saw nothing wrong in it. In a February 2019 report, the government’s auditor, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, said India had not overpaid for the jets.HT has reached out to the CBI for a response and the copy will be updated once the agency responds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/french-journal-mediapart-claims-new-evidence-of-kickbacks-in-rafale-deal-101636346455255.html
08-11-2021||India||Air pollution particularly harmful for kids, say WHO, Unicef: All you need to know||Several cities across the country are currently battling severe deterioration in air quality. While air pollution, in general, is hazardous to health, it is particularly harmful for children, Livehindustan, Hindustan Times' sister publication, has reported citing international bodies such as World Health Organization (WHO) and Unicef. According to the two organisations, pollutants attack kids the most as their bodies are yet to fully develop.Here's all you need to know:(1.) According to WHO, the lungs of a child, who is living in a region where air pollution is quite severe, may not function properly by the time he attains adulthood. Due to weak lungs, such children, when they grow up, are likely to develop asthma. A 2018 report of the global health body said that around 93 per cent children, who are under the age of 15, years breathe toxic air. A layer of haze lingers in the sky in Delhi as the air quality in the national capital deteriorates and remains in the 'severe' category for the third consecutive day.Visuals around Barapullah flyover this morning. pic.twitter.com/HDWYGyeJXA(2.) Meanwhile, Unicef, citing one of its recent reports, has said that kids take in polluted particles two to three times more than those taken in by adults. This, as per the agency, is because the former breather faster than the latter. An adult breathes 12 to 18 times in a minute, while kids, in the same time, breathe 20 to 30 times. The pace is even faster among infants, who breathe 30 to 40 times in 60 seconds, it said. Also, according to Unicef, around 130,000 children die every year in south Asia, including India, due to toxic air.(3.) Particulate Matter (PM), of the size of 2.5 macrons, are among smaller air pollutants which can enter a child's body, and affect organs such as lungs, eyes and brain. Air quality deteriorates in Delhi-NCR; visuals from Noida & Ghaziabad pic.twitter.com/0Qh6DeovTe(4.) Statistics from Greenpeace, an environmental organisation, show that in 2020, there were around 57,000 untimely deaths in Delhi which can be attributed to pollution in the air. Separately, a WHO report shows that the concentration of PM2.5 in India's air is five times more than what is acceptable.(5.) India (168) fared worse than its neighbours Sri Lanka (109), Pakistan (142), Nepal (145) and Bangladesh (162), all of whom have a better air quality, the 12th biennial Environmental Performance Index (EPI) showed. A total of 180 countries featured on the list.(6.) The United States (24), Israel (29), Russia (58), Saudi Arabia (90) and China (120) also performed better than India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-pollution-particularly-harmful-for-kids-say-who-unicef-all-you-need-to-know-101636342501086.html

The doodle has been crafted by India-based illustrator and art director Ibrahim Rayintakath and depicts Ranadive looking through a microscope.Ranadive is best known for her groundbreaking cancer research and devotion to creating a more equitable society through science and education.Kamal Samarath, better known as Kamal Ranadive, was born on November 8, 1917, in Pune, Maharashtra. Her father’s encouragement to pursue a medical education inspired Ranadive to excel academically, but she found her calling in biology instead.In 1949, she received a doctorate in cytology, the study of cells, while working as a researcher in the Indian Cancer Research Center (ICRC). After a fellowship at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, USA, she returned to Mumbai (then Bombay) and the ICRC, where she established the country’s first tissue culture laboratory.As the director of the ICRC and a pioneer in animal modeling of cancer development, she was among the first researchers in India to propose a link between breast cancer and heredity and to identify the links among cancers and certain viruses. Continuing this trailblazing work, Ranadive studied Mycobacterium leprae, the bacterium that causes leprosy, and aided in developing a vaccine. In 1973, Dr. Ranadive and 11 colleagues founded the Indian Women Scientists’ Association (IWSA) to support women in scientific fields.“Ranadive fervently encouraged students and Indian scholars abroad to return to India and put their knowledge to work for their communities. After retiring in 1989, Dr. Ranadive worked in rural communities in Maharashtra, training women as healthcare workers and providing health and nutrition education. The IWSA now has 11 chapters in India and provides scholarships and childcare options for women in science. Dr. Ranadive’s dedication to health justice and education remains influential to her students who work as scientists today,” Google said in a post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/google-doodle-celebrates-indian-cell-biologist-kamal-ranadive-s-104th-birthday-101636342110465.html

The other semi-final will see Australia clash against Pakistan, the only undefeated team in this tournament.  The final is scheduled for Sunday, November 14. This week is also action-packed as far as football is concerned. A series of World Cup 2022 qualifying matches – 18, to be precise – are to be played this Thursday through Sunday. There are some exciting match-ups on Sunday – Croatia vs Russia, Portugal vs Serbia and Spain vs Sweden, to name just three.  Sunday will also see the Brazilian Formula 1 Grand Prix, after which there are four more races to decide the winner of this year’s championship. Dutch driver Max Verstappen, who races for Red Bull Racing, is the current frontrunner with reigning world champion Lewis Hamilton in second position.  Back in India, the Covid wave seems to be ebbing from most states, including in Maharashtra, the country’s worst-affected state. The state’s task force has been warning citizens to keep adhering to Covid-appropriate behaviour and also about a possible rise in cases post-Diwali. With more than 6.6 million cases and 140,000-plus deaths, Maharashtra’s numbers are a bellwether for other states. This week, the state cabinet will discuss precisely this – whether Maharashtra is ready for a further easing of restrictions.  In Delhi and the neighbouring states, the hot button topic will continue to be bleak pollution numbers. With ‘severe’ category air quality for most days of last week, Delhi may see similar numbers this week too, as NASA images show. According to data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), instances of stubble burning have been showing up and increasing in intensity in parts of Pakistan and India including Punjab and Haryana.  Delhi environment minister said on Sunday said that the Capital cannot get freedom from pollution till an immediate solution as well as a long-term joint action plan is put in place to handle the annual problem of stubble burning. Rai wrote to the Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav, and demanded that an emergency meeting of the states of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan be called to discuss the problem of farm fires. Citing data since November 1, Rai said the spike in air pollution in Delhi has coincided with the increase in the number of farm fires in the neighbouring states. Will other states take heed and meet on the one topic that is keep the national capital in distress? We could get some pointers this week, even if not a definitive answer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-week-ahead-india-eliminated-in-t20-world-cup-covid-wave-ebbs-101636313533545.html

The two leaders were Both Verma and Rajbhar are MLAs from Assembly constituencies in Ambedkar Nagar. Verma is an MLA from Katehari, while Rajbhar has the Akbarpur constituency. They were expelled from the BSP for ‘anti-party activities’.In a series of tweets, Mayawati said the inclusion of expelled leaders of the BSP and other rival parties would not increase the SP’s support base but would weaken it further.“The SP should know that by taking such selfish party-hoppers, the ticket-seekers, within its fold is only going to make its workers angry, many of whom are in touch with the BSP. “These people are going to inflict severe damage to the party from inside during the polls,” she said.The former Uttar Pradesh chief minister made it clear that she was not eager to open her party’s doors to the defectors from other parties who wished to join the BSP after being denied tickets for the assembly election. Rather, the BSP will give the party ticket to its leaders instead of defectors, she said.Speaking at the Janadesh rally in Ambedkar Nagar district earlier in the day, both Verma and Rajbhar called upon the people to vote the ruling Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) out of power and make SP chief Akhilesh Yadav the next chief minister by ensuring the SP’s victory in the 2022 assembly election. Verma, who was the leader of the BSP legislature party, said the BSP has deviated from the ideals of Bhimrao Ambedkar and Kanshi Ram.“I was a founding member of the BSP and worked for 35 years to widen the party’s support,” he said.Rajbhar, the national general secretary of the BSP, alleged that the BSP chief had humiliated him.”Before taking action, she did not hear us. A large number of the BSP leaders and workers are deserting the party to join the SP,” he said.Meanwhile, in a separate tweet, Mayawati demanded the withdrawal of the Centre’s three new farm laws.“The BJP says ‘sabka saath, sabka vikas and sabka vishwas’. But, how can people believe this ‘jumlaa’ (rhetoric) when the country’s farmers have been so fiercely protesting against the three farm laws for such a long time and are agitated,” she tweeted in Hindi.The BSP leader noted that for the first time in three years, the Central government has given some relief to the people on Diwali by reducing the excise duty on petrol and diesel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/inclusion-of-expelled-leaders-will-weaken-sp-says-bsp-chief-101636311540659.html

The police force then managed to control the situation. In this, 30 policemen were injured, and the deputy jailor, too, was attacked by the inmates,” Superintendent of Police Ashok Kumar Meena told news agency PTI.A fire brigade had to be called after the inmates resorted to arson. Heavy police force was deployed to control the situation, police said. Two deputy jailers, Ashish Kumar and Shailesh Sonkar, were beaten up, the officials said, adding that the prisoners set the jail hospital on fire.The police, however, claimed that another prisoner, Shivam, who died later, was also suffering from an ailment and lost his life while being taken to the hospital on Sunday.But in a purported video, which surfaced on social media, Shivam claimed before his death that he suffered a bullet injury. The video purportedly showing Shivam claiming that he was hit by a bullet fired by the jailor while he was trying to close the gates of the barrack surfaced later in the afternoon.HT could not independently verify the video.The police are identifying troublemakers and stern action would be initiated, Meena said, denying police firing inside the jail. “It is not clear yet how the inmate died (during protests), it will be investigated,” he said.Additional director general of police (Kanpur zone) Bhanu Bhaskar said the violence would be probed by DIG (headquarters) VP Tripathi.Security has been stepped up in the prison after the violence, Bhaskar said.Director general jail, Anand Kumar, told PTI, “The DIG Jail is conducting an administrative inquiry.

It was not come up for discussion. Officials who were behind such a move will have to be answerable,” said the minister. Water resources minister Roshy Augustine, hailing from Idukki, where the dam is situated, also said he was unaware of the permission granted to Tamil Nadu. A junior partner in the ruling Left Democratic Front, the Communist Party of India, also expressed serious reservations over this. The issue came to light after Stalin sent a letter to Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Saturday thanking him for permission to cut trees near the baby dam in Mullaperiyar reservoir. The letter stirred controversy in the state and opposition Congress, and BJP alleged that the CM’s office permitted officials to bypass concerned ministries. They further said the decision would weaken the state’s long-pending demand for a new dam. “The CM should clarify his position on TN’s decision to raise the water level to 152 feet. He said in the assembly recently that TN has shown a favourable approach to Kerala’s growing concern. But this is not a favourable move,” said former water resources minister N K Premachandran. The opposition said officials cannot decide without considering the concerned ministries, and the government is now searching for scapegoats. Vijayan is yet to react to the issue. CM Stalin’s letter came after Tamil Nadu minister Dorai Murugan said that the state would raise the water level to 152 feet after strengthening the Baby dam triggered a big protest in downstream areas of the dam. There are reports that chief wildlife warden Bennichan Thomas prepared the order after a meeting of concerned secretaries. But once the order snowballed into a big controversy, officials disowned the controversial decision and blamed the political leadership. The two states have been fighting over the water level at the 126 -year-old Mullaperiyar dam for more than two decades. While Kerala wants the water level to be reduced to 138 feet and build a new dam, Tamil Nadu favours water level be raised to 152 feet, saying the dam was strong enough to withstand any pressure. Idukki district has 20 small and big dams, including four major ones Mullaperiyar, Idukki, Gavi and Kaki. Dam experts fear in case of a disaster, there will be a chain reaction that will affect 3.5 million people living downstream. But Tamil Nadu dismisses it, saying it carries out regular maintenance every year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mullaperiyar-dam-kerala-govt-revokes-order-on-tree-felling-101636310574699.html
08-11-2021||India||KCR urges Centre to withdraw cess on fuel||Accusing the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance government at the Centre of misleading the people on fuel prices, Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Sunday demanded that the Centre withdraw collection of cess imposed on petrol and diesel.“For the last seven years, the Centre has been collecting cess on auto fuel in the form of agriculture development and road infrastructure, as part of the central excise duty. The entire proceeds of this cess will go to the Centre and not into the pool of tax revenues so that it is not shared with state governments,” he said, addressing a press conference at his camp office Pragati Bhavan.He said the prices the Centre had reduced on petrol and diesel on Diwali were a pittance, compared to lakhs of crores it had made in the form of cess. “It is ridiculous that Telangana BJP leaders are demanding reduction of value added tax on petrol and diesel in the state. In the last seven years, we have not increased VAT on fuel and so, there is no question of reducing it,” he said.Reacting to the state BJP leaders’ proposed agitation demanding reduction of state tax on fuel prices, the chief minister said the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi would launch a counter agitation against the Centre demanding withdrawal of cess on fuel.“I will take up a dharna, along with my ministers, MLAs and MPs, in New Delhi against the Central government on various issues, including removal of cess on fuel, withdrawal of draconian farm laws and implementation of provisions of the AP Reorganisation Act, 2014,” KCR, as the chief minister is popularly known, announced.He reacted strongly to the statement of Telangana BJP president Bandi Sanjay asking the people to go ahead with paddy cultivation this Rabi season and that the BJP would bring the chief minister on his knees to see to it that the state government purchases the entire paddy.“It is an irresponsible and mindless statement. It is the responsibility of the Centre to purchase rice from the states to ensure food security to the people. The procurement and storage of rice are under the purview of the Centre. The states have no power to market rice to other countries,” he said.He pointed out that this year the Telangana had produced record quantity of paddy due to copious rainfall and full reservoirs. “There is no clarity from the Centre as to how much quantity of boiled and raw rice it would procure from the state. It gave it in writing that it won’t be able to buy even a single kg of boiled variety rice from the state in the coming Rabi season,” he said.“That is why, we have been requesting the farmers not to go in for paddy cultivation this Rabi season. If the state BJP president has any concern for them, he should prevail upon the Centre to buy entire paddy. In that case, we don’t mind encouraging cultivation of paddy,” he said.KCR said he had been maintaining restraint towards the BJP all these years, only because he did not want to get into confrontation with the Centre in the interest of the state. “But we have lost our patience and we won’t tolerate anymore. Our party leaders and cadre will hit the streets and fight against the anti-people policies of the Centre. If Bandi Sanjay exceeds his limits, I shall slit his tongue and break his neck,” he warned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kcr-urges-centre-to-withdraw-cess-on-fuel-101636310573227.html
08-11-2021||India||Weather conditions, not climate change responsible for Chennai rain: Experts||The average rainfall received in Tamil Nadu and Chennai is more than normal during the northeast monsoon season, which started in October, weather experts said. They added that little has been learnt from 2015 devastating floods that killed more than 400 people across the state.The average rainfall received from the northeast monsoon season is 449 mm and 784 in Tamil Nadu and Chennai, respectively, according to Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) data. In 2020, this was in excess as the city and state received 477mm and 1,040mm respectively.“This year the chances of receiving above-normal rainfall in November is very high,” says independent weather blogger Pradeep John. “We have received 330 mm of rain from the northeast monsoon already, which is almost 75% of average, and we still have 50 days to go.”The rainfall in Chennai and neighbouring districts on Saturday night and Sunday left most of the city underwater, forcing the authorities to rescue over 500 people and keep them in shelters. The rainfall has been the highest Chennai has got since December 2015. IMD on Sunday said that a cyclonic circulation lies over north coastal Tamil Nadu, southeast of the Bay of Bengal and a low-pressure area is likely to form by November 9, which would then move towards the Tamil Nadu coast, bringing more rainfall for at least the next three days.Under its influence, rainfall is likely in northern regions like Chennai, Villupuram, Cuddalore and in delta areas of Mayiladuthurai and Nagapattinam districts besides neighbouring Puducherry and Kariakkal on Monday. “Showers in such regions may be heavy and at isolated places, very heavy and there could be thunderstorm activity as well. Other regions, including southern Madurai, are also expected to receive rainfall,” an official bulletin said.John further said that La Nina is considered unfavourable for the northeast monsoon and brings less rain to Tamil Nadu, but the presence of other favourable conditions such as a phenomenon called Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) and the inter-tropical convergence over the state could be the reason behind Sunday’s downpour.“Even in a La Nina year, if there is a favourable Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), it will give low-pressure systems and monsoons may not end in a deficit,” John said. “But the key is the MJO. We are seeing that it has had a longer presence, so more low pressures will come to Tamil Nadu, and its influence is seen now,” said John. “This year is similar to the pattern of 2005 where one after another low pressure kept coming.” John and weather department officials ruled out the effects of climate change. “These extreme rains have happened several times in the past too. It is not due to any climatic change. The record for the highest rainfall in Chennai on a single day in November is still 1976,” said YEA Raj, meteorological expert and retired deputy director of the RMC. “For the last three years, we have not had such high rainfall in Chennai. But since the northeast monsoon began this year, several parts of Tamil Nadu have received more than 17cm of rainfall, but more flooding happens in Chennai due to more built-up area.” Activists say that no lessons have been learned after the city flooded in 2015 concerning land planning and removal of encroachments such as the infrastructure around rivers, lakes and watercourses.“Unless we fix these systemic problems, Chennai will flood again,” says Pooja Kumar, coordinator, Coastal Resource Centre. “Infrastructure projects that come up on flood plains and wetlands are approved by regulatory authorities. These encroachments drastically alter the water spread, carrying capacity of the river.”Chennai’s wide network of integrated stormwater drains has also not helped in draining water. “These projects are also planned to bring water to the tail end of the river basins which are already encroached. The carrying capacity of a river is also impacted because of dumping of fly ash, not desilting and untreated sewage flowing into the river.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/weather-conditions-not-climate-change-responsible-for-chennai-rainexperts-101636310570590.html
08-11-2021||India||Kerala man’s tryst with exotic fruits||Latin American, Australian to Amazon rainforest fruits, microbiologist Hari Narayanan has them in his small garden in Kottarakara, a town in south Kerala’s Kollam district. He has grown about 880 varieties of fruit-bearing plants from different parts of the world in his orchard, called ‘Green Grama’. Film stars to politicians to common man visit the orchard to taste exotic fruits and get their saplings. But, of course, his first customers are winged guests. “It is their world. They are rightful heir, not me. I take ripened fruits only after my guests have them enough,” said the 42-year-old who was a senior scientist with the Murugappa group. Whether it is Amazon rainforest’s red plum, sweet dark baccaurea, yoruba soft cane and giant araza boi, he has grown them all. And he has also developed on his own a plum cherry that he has named “Green Gama Sweet 17”. How he got a passion for exotic fruits? “I was forced to leave my scientist’s job ten years ago after my mother fell ill. When I came back, I was totally blank and found my small plot of land (60 cents) full of wild grass and also arid due to neglect. One day I came across a fruit chart of my daughter and realised that I have no idea about half of them,” he explained how such a taste blossomed in him. Next two years he started communicating with exotic fruit growers and stockists across the world including Anestor Mezzomo, a Brazilian authority on exotic fruits who died two years ago. Initially nobody noticed him but later some came around after realising his quest and inquisitive nature. It was a challenge he took unmindful of risks and ridicule involved. First he started studying about fruits that can be grown in a climatic condition similar to Kerala. Taking a cue from the input and response he received, Narayanan started a Facebook collective called “Mannum Manasum” (earth and mind) which has now around 100,000 members, he said. He also runs a YouTube channel “Green Grama” which introduces new fruits, their cultivation methods and health benefits that help draw many newcomers into the world of fruits. “Initially it was tough. I travelled to many parts of the country in search of seeds, plants and right information. Slowly people started coming to me,” he said, adding many VIPs call him regularly and what moved him most was a call from his favourite singer K J Yesudas. “That was one of my brightest moments in life. He was my idol since childhood. And both of us are ardent devotees of Lord Ayyappa, presiding deity of Sabarimala hill temple,” he said. Earlier Narayanan used to give everything free of cost, but now he slightly charges for saplings, but fruits remain free. Now he also works as a consultant to set up fruit farms selectively. Adani Group has invited him to set up one at the upcoming Vizinjam Port in Thiruvananthapuram. “I want people to imbibe the spirit of planting and we can inculcate this in students and others. Buds, fresh leaves, fruits and chirping birds around, they instill a lot of positivity and energy. We all can help nature to flourish and we have to realise the earth belongs to all,” he said. His wife K S Vrinda, a gynaecologist, and three children give him accompaniment in his pursuit. “We talk big about carbon neutral these days. The first lesson is to plant enough trees and saplings. Nature is not dependent on man, but the latter is heavily dependent on nature. We have to realise this,” Narayanan said, adding he is happy that many schools and colleges in the state have seed and forest clubs these days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-man-s-tryst-with-exotic-fruits-101636310513144.html
08-11-2021||India||Five years since demonetisation: What has changed?||November 8, 2021 marks five years of demonetisation in India. On this day in 2016, in a televised address at 8 pm, Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared that currency notes of ₹500 and ₹1000 -- these two denominations were 86% of the currency in circulation at the time in terms of value -- would cease to be legal tender. What has changed in the Indian economy in these five years? How many of these changes are linked to demonetisation?The surgical strike on illegal cash that wasn’tWhile demonetisation was subsequently described as a policy boost to promoting digital payments, the original policy had very different stated targets. The biggest promise of demonetisation was that it would purge unaccounted cash in the system, with those hoarding forced to deposit it in the banks.The Prime Minister’s speech announcing the policy said: “Which honest citizen would not be pained by reports of crores worth of currency notes stashed under the beds of government officers? Or by reports of cash found in gunny bags”. The implicit idea was that those who had unaccounted cash with them would be forced to either declare it to the tax authorities or just get rid of it. Many described demonetisation as a sort of surgical strike against corruption.This idea was also supported by some economists, such as Soumya Kanti Ghosh, the chief economic advisor of India’s largest bank, the State Bank of India. In an article published in the Business Standard newspaper on November 14, 2016 Ghosh estimated that “roughly around ₹4.5 lakh crore of (demonetised) money could disappear from the system”. “On the lighter side, we hope too big an amount of such notes are not burnt adding to the Delhi smog”, Ghosh added in that article.Such hopes (and potential fires) were extinguished very soon. In his budget speech after demonetisation on February 2, 2017, then finance minister Arun Jaitley gave the first hints that demonetisation had not led to large scale purge of unaccounted cash deposits. “After the demonetisation, the preliminary analysis of data received in respect of deposits made by people in old currency presents a revealing picture. During the period 8th November to 30th December 2016, deposits between Rs2 lakh and Rs80 lakh were made in about 1.09 crore accounts with an average deposit size of Rs5.03 lakh. Deposits of more than 80 lakh were made in 1.48 lakh accounts with average deposit size of Rs3.31 crores”, the Budget speech said.This author had put these numbers into context in a Mint article published on February 2, 2017. “The total amount which has been deposited under these two categories can be calculated by multiplying the number of accounts with the average deposit figures mentioned by Jaitley. This gives a figure of Rs5.48 lakh crores for deposits worth less than Rs80 lakh and Rs4.89 lakh crore for more than Rs80 lakh. The aggregate deposits under the two categories amount to Rs10.38 lakh crore. This works out to around two-third of the total value of demonetised currency, which was valued at around 15.44 lakh crore. These figures also tell us that around 31% of the total value of demonetised currency has come back in individual deposits of Rs80 lakh or more. These figures show that a large chunk of the demonetised currency which has come back into banks is from the super-rich”, that article said.By the time the Reserve Bank of India came up with final figures about the amount of demonetised currency returned to banks, the figure was more than 99%.Has demonetisation pushed India towards a cashless trajectory?Describing demonetisation as a nudge towards digital payments, which is how the policy is justified by many people today, was an after-thought although the original policy announcement did talk about reducing the amount of cash in circulation in the Indian economy.“The magnitude of cash in circulation is directly linked to the level of corruption. Inflation becomes worse through the deployment of cash earned in corrupt ways. The poor have to bear the brunt of this. It has a direct effect on the purchasing power of the poor and the middle class. You may yourself have experienced when buying land or a house, that apart from the amount paid by cheque, a large amount is demanded in cash. This creates problems for an honest person in buying property. The misuse of cash has led to artificial increase in the cost of goods and services like houses, land, higher education, health care and so on”, the Prime Minister’s speech of November 8, 2016 said.While digital payments have increased significantly since demonetisation (more on this later), whether or not India has become a cashless economy post demonetisation is a different question. The best metric to answer this question is to look at the ratio of currency in circulation (at the end of a fiscal year) and the nominal GDP (in that fiscal year). Currency in circulation was 12.1% of India’s nominal GDP in 2015-16, the year before demonetisation. It plummeted to 8.7% in 2016-17 as the banking system was struggling to put cash back into the system after demonetisation. Since then, this ratio has climbed steadily and it reached 12% in 2019-20. A restoration of currency in circulation to nominal GDP ratio shows that there was no significant impact of demonetisation until 2019-20.This number reached an all-time high of 14.5% in 2020-21. The latest number is more a result of the pandemic’s economic disruption; 2020-21 saw an annual contraction of 3% in India’s nominal GDP, which pushed up the cash-GDP ratio, than a sudden increase in preference of cash in the Indian economy.Did demonetisation lead to a tax-windfall for the state?This is a more difficult question to answer than the cashless economy question. The reason is, demonetisation was not the only policy change which has affected tax collections in India. It was followed by the roll-out of Goods and Services Tax in July 2017. In September 2019, the government announced a significant reduction in Corporation Tax rates, which led to a sharp fall in direct tax collections. Even as economic observers were waiting for the long-term effects of corporation tax cuts, the economy was hit by the pandemic, which led to a sharp fall in GDP and hence tax collections across the board. With these caveats in place, a look at the central government’s gross tax collection vis-a-vis its budgeted targets — they are the best measure of whether the government’s own expectations about tax collection have been fulfilled — does not show much of an improvement after demonetisation.An even bigger question about the long-term gains of demonetisation for the economy comes from the fact that GDP growth rate started declining sharply in the post-demonetisation years. India’s GDP growth rate increased consistently from 5.2% in 2011-12 to 8.3% in 2016-17. This trend reserved itself and the economy started losing growth momentum with the GDP growth reaching just 4% in 2019-20. With the pandemic year witnessing the highest ever GDP contraction of 7.3% in 2020-21 and a strong base effect in GDP numbers for 2021-22 and perhaps even 2022-23, the waters are now far too muddied to make any scientific assessment about demonetisation’s impact.Demonetisation’s impact on digital payments and formalisation of the economyTwo recent developments have rekindled the debate on the long-term gains of demonetisation. The value of transactions through the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) crossed $100 billion in October 2021. UPIs were only introduced in the post demonetisation period in the country and their rapid growth is truly stellar. This is an innovation of global scale and quality.A research note issued by Soumya Kanti Ghosh on November 1 said that the Indian economy had undergone a large-scale formalisation in the post-demonetisation years. The note cites a National Statistical Commission estimate of informal sector share of 52% in 2017-18 and claims that this has come down to at most 20% of the country’s GDP.The note lauds this development. “Formalisation of an economy is always better from a policy perspective”, it says. To be sure, the note also calls for providing relief to the poorer sections of the society. “Hence it is important and ethical that even as we formalise, we must support honest tax paying households, through a better designed tax structure, particularly indirect taxes on items like fuel”, it said.Is a surge in digital payment channels such as UPI and supposedly rapid formalisation of the economy the beginning of realisation of the long-term benefits of the government’s pro-formalisation approach; demonetisation, being the first of these? The answer is more nuanced than what some people might want us to believe.Let us look at the rapid growth of UPIs first. This would not have been possible without the widespread expansion in mobile internet and smartphones in the country, which has allowed consumers and businesses to conduct even small ticket digital transactions without the infrastructure of point of sale (POS) machines. It is also a fact that some of the transactions happening through UPI used to happen through credit or debit cards previously. The value of transactions via credit and debit cards today is significantly lower than it was a couple of years ago. While UPI transactions have grown at the cost of other forms of digital transactions, overall too, there has been a sharp growth in them. The digital transactions space today is far more robust than it was five years ago. Even small-ticket transactions are now carried out digitally, and are far more commonplace than in the period before demonetisation.Let us take the question of policy-driven formalisation now. There is some merit in Ghosh’s argument that a more formal economy is better even from a pro-poor perspective. For example, the current government has brought millions of people under the formal banking sector by opening Jan Dhan Accounts. This infrastructure allowed it to make cash transfers (even if there have been quibbles about the amounts) to such families during the nation-wide lockdown last year. Similarly, the ongoing efforts to build a database of migrant workers will give a better handle for future policy intervention.While these developments are definitely laudable, they are far from sufficient to meet the central challenge of generating quality employment for millions of Indian workers. In some cases, formalisation of the economy can perpetuate, even worsen working conditions in the short-term. Anecdotally, the Goods and Services Tax, introduced in 2017, has also been responsible for formalizing the economy — by forcing more businesses to come into the tax net. But in the process, it has made some small businesses uncompetitive.A research note dated July 15, 2021 by Pranjul Bhandari, chief India economist at HSBC Securities and Capital Markets Research has a useful perspective on the issue of policy-driven formalisation.“But “formalisation” can be a double-edged sword. If it happens at the cost of putting small informal firms out of business, then the disruption in the informal sector can weigh on demand in subsequent periods...It is also possible that formalisation wears off over time. If the ecosystem that promotes formality does not change very much, the informal sector makes a comeback. And in that case, the efficiency gains associated with formalisation wears off...The constructive way to think about this is perhaps to differentiate between ‘forced’ and ‘organic’ formalisation. The formalisation that comes only on the back of external pressure or leads to deep distress in the informal sector, may not be sustainable. In contrast, the formalisation that happens on the back of policy changes which help small and informal firms grow over time into medium or larger formal sector firms, is more sustainable.”Vineet Sachdev contributed to this story||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/five-years-since-demonetisation-what-has-changed-101636310390379.html

Being part of the government, I urge the Chief Minister to recommend the same to the Centre. Puneeth is qualified for it not only as an actor, but also for his service to the society,” the actor-turned- politician said, adding that if the matter comes before the cabinet it will get unanimous consent.Minister for Tourism Anand Singh too in Haveri said, “Puneeth Rajkumar is a person who had a mentality to serve mankind, he had joined us in several campaigns of public good like pulse polio campaign, when I was into social service... I extend my support to the demand seeking Padma Shri to him.” Kannada Actor Prem, too wished that Puneeth Rajkumar be given the Padma Shri award at the earliest.Senior Congress leader and Leader of Opposition in the state, Siddaramaiah had recently urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to award Padma Shri posthumously to Puneeth.“The love and affection Power Star Puneeth Rajkumar has gained is bigger than any title or award. I urge the Prime Minister of India to award Padma Shri posthumously to Puneeth Rajkumar. His acting and contribution to society deserves even more accolades,” he had tweeted.Recently Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, responding to a question by the media on such a demand, said, “There are rules on when and people from which sectors should be recommended for Padma awards, it will be in a way unanimous recommendation for Puneeth Rajkumar. As a government considering everything, we will take a decision.” He said the entire state and the government has love and respect for Puneeth Rajkumar.Padma Shri is one of the highest civilian honours of India announced annually on the eve of Republic Day, for distinguished service.Puneeth, popularly known as ‘Appu’ and ‘Powerstar’, by his fans, made debut on screen when he was just six-months-old and went on to win a national award as a child artist for the film Bettada Hoovu. He then re-emerge as a lead actor in 2002 and went on to star in 29 films, delivering some big hits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/demand-for-padma-award-for-puneeth-rajkumar-grows-101636310334069.html

It all started with an idea of my husband, Abhishek, adding a visit to Srinagar in the previous winters. He wanted to see the frozen Dal Lake,” says Nandish.The couple embarked on their journey to the Kashmir Valley on January 26 and checked into a local hotel.“I had done my homework and had decided to trek 33 lakes during the season as a birthday gift to myself,” Nandish, who turned 33 this year, said here.An HR manager in an information technology company, the work from home facility, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, came in handy for her to reach her goal during the trekking season, which started in mid-June.“Work hard and play hard. On my weekends, I packed my bags and joined a trekking group to achieve my goal which started with Tulian Lake,” she said.Her local trek leader Syed Tahir, who accompanied her to most of the lakes, recalled his meeting with the Bengaluru women.Tourists come here and want to do a long trek of three to four days but here was a woman, who had set a goal for herself, even before the start of the season, Tahir, an expert trekker, said.“When I interacted with her and she told me her dream, I normally asked whether she had any medical condition. Moment she told me about some kind of arthritis problem in her knee, my eyes virtually popped out in surprise but all my apprehensions faded on seeing her determination,” he told PTI. Tahir has been working in the trekking industry for nearly a decade.“Undoubtedly, she will be the first female who has completed 50 lakes in one season as no one has been able to achieve this kind of feat to the best of my memory of covering 50 Alpine Lakes in one season spread across the Kashmir valley,” he said.Mantasha Rashid, a Kashmir Administrative Service officer who runs a trust ‘Women’s Collective said, “Namratha is an inspiration to women. Despite living in a place with mountains and lakes, most Kashmiri women are not much into sports like trekking, mountaineering or swimming.” “At our voluntary women’s initiative, we have been promoting outdoor activities for women and coming across Namratha was such a motivating moment,” Rashid said.Nandish feels nostalgic as she packs her bags for her return journey to her hometown but is happy that she is being referred to by the trekking community as ‘Alpine Girl’.“I have trekked around 460 kms over 31 days during this year’s season and that too when I had a full-time job at hand,” she said.She said she wanted to do only 33 lakes as a birthday gift to herself but then “yeh dil mange more (the heart desires for more), I decided to reach the feat of 50 lakes.” Nandish, who was a hesitant traveller to Kashmir initially, is now reluctant to leave. “The people are so hospitable and warm here that I want to spend more and more time with them. I don’t feel like going as the people here made me feel one among them,” she said.Today Nandish, after performing several solo trips to Alpine lakes, feels that she is a much more confident woman.“During my last visit I suffered Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) as the height was around 13,000 feet at Murgan top. But then my inner strength and support of Tahir and my family made me achieve it.She, however, carries a regret that not many women are involved inthe trekking business in the Kashmir valley and also agreed with the thoughts shared by Mantasha that more and more participation should be encouraged.“Kashmir is a wonderful tourist destination and involving more and more women as guides to trekking groups would definitely increase the number of women visitors into the valley and this can become an alternative business for the local women in the valley,” she opined.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/alpine-girl-from-bengaluru-treks-to-50-high-altitude-lakes-in-kashmir-101636310332948.html

When developing lakes, encroachments should be cleared and green fencing should be used,” the chief minister’s office (CMO) quoted Bommai as saying in a statement.The directions come at a time when several of Bengaluru’s water bodies are increasingly being encroached by land sharks, development projects and other reasons that have led to water logging during heavy rains.Bommai held a meeting with senior officials with regards to Bengaluru Mission 2022, an initiative that aims to improve the crumbling infrastructure in a city known globally for its prowess in technology, startups, research and aerospace among other sectors.Bengaluru, once known as the land of a thousand lakes, now has barely 200 of them which are in pitiable conditions.Though the civic body and the state government earmark hundreds of crores towards rejuvenation of lakes each year, experts said this was mostly to beautify the surroundings of the lake than the ecology which is far more important than the aesthetics of such water bodies.Even the Vrishabhavathi river, once a source of water for Bengaluru, has now become nothing more than a flowing drain with toxic water on account of unplanned civic infrastructure which allows sewage water directly into lakes and other water bodies, contaminating soil, underground water and impacting the overall quality of life in a city which is known world over for its prowess in information technology, startups and aerospace among other sectors.At least 19 lakes out of the remaining 205 (out of earlier estimates of at least 250) under the Bengaluru civic body have been termed as disused lakes due to encroachments according to a February 2021 report by CSIR-National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI).A report by CSIR-National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) indicated that there are around 21 lakes out of the 205 existing on paper in which the water was fit for drinking.This claim has been contested by environmentalists, scientists, citizens among others.A report by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) in 2020 states that there is not even one lake which has water fit for drinking. Some of these encroachments are by big builders who then name these projects “lake view” to attract more interest from potential buyers, HT reported on March 21.During the recent rains, several of Bengaluru’s residential localities had witnessed floods as drains and lakes were overflowing, inundating neighbourhoods and resulting in loss of property and livelihoods.Lakes were a major source of irrigation and the city’s only source of water for centuries until authorities, over the last 20-30 years, have turned a blind eye on encroachments for building residential and commercial infrastructure to accommodate the city’s increasing population.In the recent downpour, it was also seen that heavy rains resulted in water overflowing from drains as well as sewage water entering lakes, polluting the water bodies and its fragile ecosystems.Estimates by the Indian Institute of Science states that Bengaluru receives around 700-850 mm of rains each year which is enough to accumulate around 16 thousand million cubic feet (tmc ft) of water which is almost 70% of its demand of around 19 tmc ft. But the lack of treatment plants and awareness has given rise to a situation where most of the water is let out into drains by most households except large apartment complexes where it is mandatory to have sewage treatment plants.Bommai said he had instructed officials to ensure sewage water does not enter lakes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/green-fencing-can-prevent-lake-encroachments-cm-101636310331849.html
08-11-2021||India||Congress to undertake 100 km padayatra over Mekedatu project||The Congress on Sunday said it would undertake a padayatra in the first or second week of December to pile pressure on the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the state and Centre to start the contentious Mekedatu project at the earliest. “The padayatra will be over 100 km from Mekedatu to Bengaluru,” DK Shivakumar, the president of the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) said on Sunday. “We can start the work here and there is no hurdle from the Supreme Court. We just need one environmental clearance from the centre,” Shivakumar said. The statements come at a time when the project has heightened tensions in the two south Indian states -- Tamil Nadu and Karnataka -- and threatening to reignite passion over the contentious project over River Cauvery. The Siddaramaiah-led Congress government, soon after it came to power in 2013, announced the construction of the project which would cost ₹5,912 crore to help use the excess water to quench the thirst of surrounding districts, including Bengaluru. Then Tamil Nadu chief minister, (now late) J Jayalalitha wrote to the union government not to give the project an environment clearance as it would disrupt the natural flow of water from the upper riparian state. The Basavaraj Bommai-led government too has expressed its intent to move forward with the project but is yet to secure requisite clearances from the union government which Shivakumar said displayed “lack of political will”. Mekedatu, which literally means Goat’s crossing in English, is situated around 100 km from Bengaluru in Karnataka’s Ramanagara district. The Mekedatu issue has evoked emotions on both sides of the border as it is an extension of the century-old Cauvery river water dispute that has defined generations in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, two of India’s most industrious and progressive states. The long-winding legal battles have been used as a political currency in the past as well as an active tool to deflect attention away from other issues both sides of the border and irrespective of the party in power. The Cauvery river basin originates in Karnataka and flows through Tamil Nadu and Puducherry before it enters the Bay of Bengal. Of the total catchment area of 81,155 square kilometers, 34,273 kilometers is in Karnataka, 44,016 square km in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry and about 2,866 sq kms in Kerala. Karnataka has maintained that the Mekedatu balancing reservoir-cum-drinking water project is to generate 400 MW of power and additionally utilise 4.75 tmcft of water for drinking and domestic needs in the state and particularly Bengaluru.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-to-undertake-100-km-padayatra-over-mekedatu-project-101636310278672.html
08-11-2021||India||BJP, Congress, JD(S) gear up for upcoming assembly polls||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Sunday said it will hold the ‘Janaswarajya Yatra’ ahead of the election for the upper house of the state legislature under four teams who would tour around seven districts each to mobilise support in the grass roots.The decision to collectively go in for a tour potentially undercuts former chief minister BS Yediyurappa’s plans to undertake a statewide yatra to mobilise support for the party ahead of the 2023 assembly election.“On the backdrop of the Vidhana Parishad elections on November 19, there will be a Janaswaraj conclave,” Ravi Kumar, BJP state general secretary and MLC said in Bengaluru on Sunday.The statements come at a time when Yediyurappa has put off his state-wide tour missing his own deadlines as the party, people aware of the developments said, was to contain the 78-year-old from continuing to wield his influence over the party and people in the wake of the national leadership’s plan to infuse newer leadership with its core ideology.The BJP also said it was expecting more leaders from other parties into its fold with polls for various bodies around the corner.Kumar said CS Manohar of the Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S) has expressed his interest to join the BJP and has asked to be the candidate for the upcoming elections for the upper house of the state legislature, expected to be held in December or January.The BJP is looking to gain control over the upper house as it plans to introduce more bills, considered contentious, and be passed without too many hurdles.The BJP has 32 members in the upper house while the Congress has 29 and the JD(S) has 12.There is one Independent and one member who serves as the chairman.The Congress too is taking no chances and has announced to initiate its membership drive from Bengaluru on November 14.DK Shivakumar, the president of the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) on Sunday, said the party will begin its membership drive and initiate other activities to bring in more people into the fold.Shivakumar said there will be forms available both online and offline. “All our state leaders have decided to start the membership drive from Bengaluru city on November 14,” Shivakumar said.He said those who have been serving the party will also have to renew their memberships. New members have to pay a fee of ₹5 and to become active members they would have to pay ₹100, he added.He said the Congress would start its ‘Janajagruthi Abhiyaan’ to raise awareness among people about the misdeeds and hardships under the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led BJP government at the centre and Bommai-led administration in the state.He said all leaders would go to each and every grama panchayati and assembly constituency to raise awareness on the hardships like price rise, fuel price hikes and other problems heaped on the population by the BJP government at the centre and state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-congress-jd-s-gear-up-for-upcoming-assembly-polls-101636310277480.html
08-11-2021||India||Kodava Samaj bans cake cutting, opening of champagne to ‘save’ culture||The Kodava Samaj in Ponnampet of Kodagu district, about 225 km from Bengaluru, has banned all cake cutting and opening of champagne among other celebrations as it is not a part of the community’s culture.Other restrictions include that bridegrooms will not be allowed to sport beards and brides will not be allowed if their hair is let loose during the ceremony.“Kodavas have their own distinct culture. We can survive only if our culture survives. Cutting of cakes and sharing of champagne by new couples during marriage ceremonies is not our culture. The decision has been taken in this regard in our annual meeting,” Chotakmada Rajiv Bopaiah, the president of Ponnampet Kodava Samaj, was quoted as saying by IANS on Saturday.The statement adds to the increasing trend of restricting activities by so-called custodians of culture across several regions in the country.The president could not be reached for comment.A message has been circulated on WhatsApp groups, detailing the restrictions.The Kodavas are a small ethnic group mostly found in the coffee growing region of Kodagu and are known for their contributions to the Indian armed forces, sports and various other fields. The community also has a distinct culture from other parts of Karnataka or southern India.Ponnampet is a small town in Kodagu district. Kodagu has several such Kodava Samajas which often represents the people living in the specific region and is restricted to members of the community even though some of these venues are let out for weddings and events of other communities as well.The directions come at a time where self-styled custodians of culture have continued to impose restrictions in the garb of protecting tradition.Considered a progressive community, the restrictions have evoked mixed responses from members of the ethnic group. In October last year, several members of the community were up in arms after photographs from a gay wedding in California.Dr Sharath Ponnappa, a native of Kodagu and practicing in California married his partner Sundeep Dosanjh in September 2020, sporting Kodava wedding attire. The bridegroom and the bride’s attire in Kodava culture is very distinct, with a knife and very specific style of jewellery that sets it apart from others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kodava-samaj-bans-cake-cutting-opening-of-champagne-to-save-culture-101636310275940.html
08-11-2021||India||Reports of JD(S) leaders leaving not new: Kumaraswamy, ahead of polls||Troubles continue to increase for the Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S) with several top leaders of the party helmed by former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda planning to leave it to join either of the two national parties – the BJP and Congress- before various polls in the state in the next few months.The upcoming elections include 25 for the upper house of the state legislature in January next year, zilla and taluk panchayat, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP - the city’s civic body) and the 2023 assembly polls.“Those claiming to leave, it’s not something new. It has already been decided in the last two years. We know what decisions have been taken two years ago itself,” said HD Kumaraswamy, the JD(S) leader and former chief minister.The statement on Saturday came even as leaders like GT Deve Gowda, Srinivas Gowda and Gubbi Srinivas among others have publicly aired their intent to leave the regional outfit before the 2023 assembly election.While the practice of defections before elections is nothing new for political parties, the movement at the top has an impact on grassroot level workers who have often expressed their anger through the ballot box.Siddaramaiah, the Congress leader and former chief minister, on November 2, said the party lost in Sindgi assembly bypolls as workers were not able to combine their efforts as differences persisted.The Congress had fielded Ashok Managuli, the late JD(S) legislator’s son, in the October 30 bypolls that had cost the regional outfit another seat in the lower house of the state legislature. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won this seat while it lost Hanagal in Haveri, the home district of chief minister Basavaraj Bommai.The Congress and JD(S) are no strangers to the effects of grassroot level workers turning against the party, allowing the BJP to capitalise on the discord and expand its footprint across regions where it has minimal presence.The Congress and JD(S) were reduced to just one seat each across all 28 constituencies in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections as worker were unable to overcome historical differences even though the leaders at the top had stitched an uncomfortable alliance to defeat the BJP.Sumalatha, an actress and the wife of Kannada film idol Amabareesh (MH Amarnath), benefited as she became the first ever Independent candidate to win from Karnataka.She was officially backed by the BJP, who did not field a candidate in Mandya, in which she defeated then sitting chief minister Kumaraswamy’s son Nikhil in his debut electoral contest.The BJP too had used the opportunity to expand its presence in the old Mysuru region with Sumalathat and KC Narayana Gowda, who had defected from the JD(S) to the saffron outfit in 2019, giving the former its first ever taste of success in what is widely believed to be a JD(S) stronghold.“All big leaders including the current chief minister (Bommai) and his predecessor (Siddaramaiah) got their training from us and left for individual gains,” TA Sharavana, a leader from the party said on Sunday. He added that there were many leaders willing to leave but many others remain committed to the cause of the regional outfit.Political analysts say the JD(S) continues to thrive despite the onslaught on its organisation from both national outfits and it’s own challenges stemming from the deep-seated rivalry between the two sons of Deve Gowda.“Like those leaving the party, the JD(S) also benefits from discontentment in other parties as leaders who were denied tickets look for established outfits to contest elections,” said A Narayana, a Bengaluru-based political analyst.But this often leads to discord between workers who tend to hold onto rivalries despite the alliance at the leadership.The JD(S) will hold an eight-day meet, starting from Monday, to iron out differences within their grassroots level workers ahead of the local body elections that would help it gauge its support structure before 2023.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/reports-of-jd-s-leaders-leaving-not-new-kumaraswamy-ahead-of-polls-101636310274031.html
08-11-2021||India||SIT of Delhi NCB issues summons to Aryan, others in drugs case||After taking over the six cases being investigated by the Mumbai Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), the special investigation team (SIT) of the Delhi NCB has started probe in the cruise drug raid case. The team has summoned actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan, his friend Arbaaz Merchant, alleged drug peddler Achit Kumar and several others connected to the case. Arbaaz Merchant and Achit Kumar reached the NCB office in south Mumbai on Sunday, and the agency has been recording their statement.The SIT headed by IPS Sanjay Singh said, “We have summoned several people including accused and witnesses connected to the case and we are examining them.”Arbaaz Merchant’s father advocate Aslam Merchant said, “We received the summons on Sunday, the date of issue was mentioned Saturday, hence after getting it we came to the NCB office. We do not have any issue and we are cooperating in the investigation. Good for us that the facts will come out. As per law, the NCB can call any suspects for investigation if they are required to verify certain facts and to maintain transparency in the case.”An NCB source said, “Summons have been sent to Aryan Khan and we will record his statement in the coming days.”Aryan, Merchant and Munmun Dhamecha were detained by the NCB on October 2 after a drug raid on a cruise ship. After questioning several hours, Khan, Merchant and Dhamecha were arrested on October 3. Khan and Merchant were sent to judicial custody at Arthur Road Jail on October 7, while Dhamecha was sent to Byculla Women’s Jail. They got bail from Bombay high court on October 28 and Khan was released from jail on October 30, while Merchant and Dhamecha on October 31.The SIT also visited the cruise ship to verify the facts on Saturday evening. The agency recorded the statement of CISF officials as well as staff members of the cruise ship presented during the raid on October 3. Zonal director Sameer Wankhede was with the team while visiting the cruise ship. “The captain of the cruise ship, nine independent witnesses including Prabhakar Sail as well as other people connected in the case will also be examined,” said Singh.The SIT was formed on November 5 and NCB chief SN Pradhan issued an order transferring the six cases from NCB’s Mumbai zonal unit to the operations branch from its headquarters to conduct a deeper investigation. The SIT team reached Mumbai on Saturday to take over the probe into six cases, which included the drugs-on-cruise case, in which actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan was arrested by Wankhede.Singh said SIT will take help of Wankhede who was supervising the case earlier.The other cases also include the drugs case against Sameer Khan, son-in-law of Maharashtra cabinet minister and Nationalist Congress Party leader Nawab Malik. Khan was arrested by NCB in the first week of January 2021 and was released on bail on September 28.The SIT will also probe the case involving actor Armaan Kohli. An NCB team led by Wankhede had raided Kohli’s Juhu residence on August 28 and recovered a small quantity of cocaine. Kohli was arrested on August 29.The fourth case to be probed by the SIT was registered by the agency’s Mumbai zonal unit on July 25 when it arrested three persons – Sameer Mukhtar Sayyed alias Sam Langda, Zakir Sayyed alias Zakir Takla alias Zakir Chikna and Mohammad Amed Shamsuddin Shaikh and allegedly seized 1.2kg of charas, an intermediate quantity of mephedrone along with ₹17.5 lakh in cash from them. NCB claimed that Sameer Merchant alias Sam Langda was a notorious, organised drug mafia member.The fifth case on the list was registered in September when NCB recovered an intermediate quantity of mephedrone, whereas the sixth case related to the recovery of mephedrone from Dongri area in south Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sit-of-delhi-ncb-issues-summons-to-aryan-others-in-drugs-case-101636310034600.html
08-11-2021||India||600 farmers died but House yet to pass resolution: Meghalaya governor||Amid continuous protests against the Centre’s agricultural laws, Meghalaya governor Satya Pal Malik on Sunday said leaders in Delhi offer condolences “even when a dog dies” but haven’t cared about the deaths’ of farmers.The governor said there hasn’t been an agitation earlier in the country in which “600 people” have died, a reference to the deaths due to various causes of protesters camping on the borders of Delhi against the farm laws since November last year.“Even if a dog dies, a condolence message is sent by Delhi leaders. But I am hurt that 600 farmers have died but no resolution was passed in Parliament,” Malik, who was addressing the Global Jat Summit here, said. Referring to the assassination of former prime minister Indira Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards in 1984, Malik said he had told Prime Minister Narendra Modi not to antagonise Sikhs and Jats - the communities who form a bulk of the protesters.“I met Prime Minister Narendra Modi… and told him not to do two things -- don’t use force on the protesting farmers and don’t send them back empty-handed as they do not forget for 300 years,” he added. The Meghalaya governor, who was earlier posted in Jammu and Kashmir, claimed the Army has felt the impact of the agitation as the farmers’ sons also serve in the military.“Anything can happen. Today, you are in power and are arrogant and do not know what repercussions would follow. When Kargil happens, the sons of these farmers are sent to the hills to fight,” he said.“I do not want the day to come when farmers react… Till date, the farmers have not even thrown a stone,” he added.Reacting to his speech, former Rajasthan minister and Bharatiya Janata Party MLA Vasudev Devnani said the governor should maintain the dignity of the post. “Such statements do not help anyone. If he wants to convey something, then he should speak to the President of India,” he said. State transport minister and Congress leader Pratap Singh Khachariyawas said: “What could be more shameful when a governor appointed by the BJP had to raise the farmer’s issue. The central government should apologise and withdraw the farm laws.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/leaders-in-delhi-condole-a-dog-s-death-not-farmers-meghalaya-governor-101636310030147.html
08-11-2021||India||SIT to quiz Dera chief Ram Rahim over 2015 sacrilege case in Rohtak jail today||A special investigation team (SIT) of Punjab Police on Monday will visit Rohtak’s Sunaria jail to question Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh in connection with a 2015 sacrilege case, people familiar with the matter said. Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh is currently serving a life term in Sunaria jail since his conviction in 2017 for raping two disciples.Following orders of Punjab and Haryana high court, Rohtak district magistrate (DM) Captain Manoj Kumar on Saturday granted permission to the SIT, led by inspector general Surinder Pal Singh Parmar, to probe Ram Rahim in connection with theft of a copy of Guru Granth Sahib from a gurudwara in Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village on June 1, 2015, the people cited above said.As many as seven Dera followers were arrested in connection with the case, all of whom are on bail right now.In its charge sheet, the SIT claimed that it was Ram Rahim who ordered the sacrilege to avenge the insult of sect followers by a Sikh preacher. Three Dera committee members – Harsh Dhuri, Sandeep Bareta and Pardeep Kler – too were booked in this case but are absconding. Permission was granted under section 56 (4) (admission of police officers and interrogation of prisoners by them) of Punjab Jail Manual, and instructions were already issued to Sunaria jail superintendent in this regard. “As per section 56 (5) of Jail Manual, any interview, permitted under an order from the district magistrate, shall take place in the presence of the deputy superintendent or an officer of the jail, who shall maintain such a distance that he may not hear the conversation that takes place,” Kumar told jail authorities.Last month, a Faridkot court had issued a production warrant against Ram Rahim on a plea by the Punjab Police SIT, seeking his custodial interrogation in the case. The Punjab and Haryana high court, however, directed Punjab Police to probe the accused in Rohtak jail itself, if it wanted, and directed jail authorities to make arrangements for the same.On November 2, the SIT chief had requested the Rohtak DM to allow his team to probe the accused on orders of the high court. The team has already prepared a list of questions on the basis of evidence on record for the Dera chief. Parmar said the SIT has completed all the formalities to probe Ram Rahim in the prison.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sit-to-quiz-dera-chief-ram-rahim-over-2015-sacrilege-case-in-rohtak-jail-today-101636309852142.html
08-11-2021||India||India, China harden positions on LAC row||India and China have hardened their stance on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, going by increased military activities on both sides of the boundary, infrastructure development, surveillance and combat manoeuvres by their armies in the midst of the ongoing border standoff in the sensitive sector, China watchers said on Sunday, four weeks after military talks to cool Ladakh tensions reached an impasse.Military talks are unlikely to result in a breakthrough and only higher intervention can show the way to resolving the 18-month-old border crisis, said one of the people cited above. The Indian Army’s activities in the sector are in response to the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) actions and countermeasures have been taken to stay ready for any contingency, said a second official.Despite two rounds of disengagement at friction points on the LAC this year, the two armies still have 50,000 to 60,000 troops each and advanced weaponry deployed in Ladakh. In a report released last week, the US defence department said Beijing was taking “incremental and tactical actions to press its claims” at LAC, despite participating in talks to resolve the crisis.It is quite obvious that positions on both sides have hardened and the statements from India and China after the 13th round of military-level talks are a clear indication that finding common ground is difficult, said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd).“Any breakthrough in the deadlock will now have to come at the political and diplomatic level. However, it is uncertain whether there is a desire in either country to undertake such initiatives at this stage,” he added.PLA did not agree to suggestions made by the Indian Army at the 13th round of talks on October 10. The Indian Army said it made constructive suggestions for resolving the remaining areas but the Chinese side was not agreeable and also could not provide any forward-looking proposals, while China accused India of unreasonable and unrealistic demands in an unusually aggressive statement.PLA carried out tank drills across LAC after the October 10 talks hit an impasse, and the Indian Army launched an airborne exercise in eastern Ladakh last week to validate and showcase its rapid response capabilities.There’s been a visible hardening of attitudes on both sides but talks are still on, said Lieutenant General SL Narasimhan (retd), a China expert and member of the National Security Advisory Board. “The fact that the military dialogue is still on indicates that things could progress, provided there is peace and tranquillity along the border,” Narasimhan said.There is no end in sight to the standoff, with army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane stating on October 9 that if PLA is there to stay in the Ladakh theatre, so is the Indian Army. He was referring to the military buildup and infrastructure development by the neighbouring army across LAC.PLA has taken a hard line on LAC and India is taking countermeasures to defend its interests, said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General BS Jaswal (retd). “We want to retain a position of strength to thwart any designs of the adversary,” Jaswal said.Asked to comment on PLA’s intentions given its aggressive moves in the northern sector, Naravane last month said: “I wish I knew. The most difficult thing is to get into your adversary’s mind. But whatever those reasons may have been, I don’t think they have been able to achieve their aims because of the rapid response by the Indian armed forces.”Highlighting Chinese attempts to continue pressing its claims at LAC, the US defence department report pointed to a large 100-home civilian village China has constructed “inside disputed territory” between Tibet and Arunachal Pradesh.Eastern Army commander Lieutenant General Manoj Pande last month flagged concerns about the “dual use” of villages being set up by China in forward areas, and said the army was factoring in the development in its operational planning.PLA has also intensified patrolling in sensitive areas across LAC in Arunachal Pradesh after the lingering standoff with India began last year in the Ladakh sector. It has ramped up area domination patrols for surveillance and orientation of newly inducted troops with a noticeable increase in visits by senior PLA officers to forward areas to supervise the military activities in the eastern sector, as previously reported by HT.In the Ladakh sector, outstanding problems at Hot Springs and Depsang are yet to be resolved. The Indian Army’s patrolling activity has been affected in Hot Springs (Patrolling Point (PP)-15) and PLA’s forward presence in Depsang has also hindered access of Indian soldiers to routes including the ones leading to PP-10, 11, 11-A, 12 and 13.Even as the border row lingers, the department of military affairs (DMA), headed by chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat, last week asked the three services to expedite their ongoing studies on the creation of threatre commands to best utilise the military’s resources for future wars and operations, and submit comprehensive reports within six months.The deadline for submitting the reports has been advanced from September 2022 to April 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-harden-positions-on-lac-row-101636309309358.html
08-11-2021||India||Tripura violence: Opposition hits out at state govt over UAPA cases||Opposition parties in Tripura on Sunday condemned the police action of booking 102 people, including journalists, under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967, in connection with the recent violence in the state.While the Congress demanded the immediate withdrawal of cases, the CPM termed the police move as an interference by the government. Speaking to news agency PTI, Tripura Pradesh Congress chief Birajit Sinha said “the mosque at Panisagar was attacked by activists of Vishwa Hindu Parishad and houses of minority communities were vandalised by them... they should be arrested first”. “I do not think the lawyers, who visited the state, came with any bad intentions and did not spread any communal hatred. The government should immediately withdraw charges against them,” he said. A mosque, a few houses and shops were reportedly vandalised by VHP activists during their rally on October 26. While four people were arrested in this regard, police later said that no mosque was burnt and photographs showing the same were not from Tripura.As many as four Delhi-based advocates, who visited the state as part of an independent fact-finding team, were booked under section 13 (any unlawful activity will be punishable with maximum seven years imprisonment along with fine) of UAPAand sections of Indian Penal Code. Besides them, 102 social media account holders were booked under UAPA for allegedly spreading misinformation. “Controversial posts on social media that can ignite communal tension are not encouraged. The concerned social media platforms can alert them, but how come the government asks to block social media accounts,”CPM leader Pabitra Kar said.A high-rank police official, on the condition of anonymity, said that “notices have served to social media companies, asking to block 102 social media accounts and provide particulars of the account holders to us”. The Editors Guild of India also criticised the government move, saying the latter cannot use such stringent laws to suppress reporting on communal violence incidents.“The Guild is of the opinion that this is an attempt by the state government to deflect attention away from its own failure to control majoritarian violence, as well as to take action against the perpetrators of this. Governments cannot use stringent laws like UAPA to suppress reporting on such incidents,” it said in a statement. The Guild demanded that the state government conduct a fair probe into the matter and also reiterated their earlier plea to the Supreme Court “to take cognizance of manner in which such laws are unjustifiably used against freedom of speech, and to issue stringent guidelines on charging journalist under them, so that these laws don’t become an easy tool for suppressing press freedom”. On October 29, the state government had alleged that a group from outside with vested interests had hatched a conspiracy against the administration to create unrest in Tripura and malign its image by uploading fake photographs of a burning mosque on social media after the October 26 incident. Last week, the Tripura high court had taken cognisance of the violence and sought a detailed report from the state government by November 10. The report, however, is yet to be submitted, according to people aware of the developments. The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has also sought an action taken report, within four weeks, from the Tripura government on the violence.

08-11-2021||India||BJP’s NEC meet discusses polls, WB violence and Modi’s leadership||At its national executive committee meeting on Sunday, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) passed a political resolution praising the leadership and policies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, discussed the strategy for the upcoming assembly elections in five states and set new targets for the party’s pan-Indian expansion.The resolution also accused the Opposition of “opportunism” and acting with a mindset of “extreme hate”, while predicting a big win for the BJP in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur on the planks of development and the party’s organisational strength.Modi asked BJP members to become a “bridge of faith” between the party and the people and expressed confidence that the BJP will win the trust of people in the upcoming assembly polls in five states. Addressing the valedictory session of the national executive, he stressed that the BJP runs on the values of “Sewa, Sanklap aur Samparan (service, resolution and commitment)” and “does not revolve around a family”, urging its members to work for people, Union minister Bhupender Yadav said, quoting the Prime Minister.Sunday’s meeting, which began with party president JP Nadda’s address and concluded with the PM’s valedictory speech, saw party leaders — some of whom were present virtually — discuss key concerns, including the political violence in West Bengal, the recent bypoll results, and the strategy on the ongoing farmers’ stir, people aware of the developments said.Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath proposed the party’s political resolution.The BJP, which is in power at the Centre and in over a dozen states, has set its eyes on the southern states and set itself the target of setting up booth committees at all 1,040,000 polling stations across India by December 25, getting in place panna pramukhs or voter list page incharges at each of these booths by April 6, 2022, and making provisions for institutionalised broadcast of the PM’s radio show Mann Ki Baat at all booths by May 2022.The BJP isn’t run by a family but by a culture of public service and dedication, Yadav said while quoting Modi.The BJP’s emphasis on expansion comes at a time when the Opposition has been exploring coalitions to take on the BJP at the Centre, and in the face of the party’s inability to take on regional satraps such as the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) in Tamil Nadu, the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) in Odisha and the Trinamool Congress (TMC) in West Bengal. The micromanagement of the electoral process at the grassroots is crucial to retain power in poll-bound states where the party may face anti-incumbency and anger over the deficiencies in key sectors of employment generation and health, people aware of the matter said.“Strengthening the party structure at the lowest levels will be a key step for poll preparation in all the five states, particularly in UP, which is the biggest in size and politically crucial,” said a party functionary.Commenting on the targets set for the expansion of the party, Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan said Nadda turned to his predecessor Amit Shah while exhorting the BJP members to increase the party’s footprint. “In 2014, Shah had set targets, many of which we achieved such as (winning) Assam, Tripura and many other states in the North East. He had said utkarsh aana baki hai (peak is yet to come) and Nadda repeated this,” Pradhan said.Pradhan, who is also incharge of the UP polls, said that even as the party faces challenges in states such as Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, it has shown exponential growth in states such as West Bengal. He was referring to the BJP having increased its vote share in the state where it now has about 70 legislators and 18 MPs.During the brainstorming about the upcoming elections, the chief ministers of four poll-bound states made a presentation on the work done by their government and gave an account of their poll preparedness. UP CM Adityanath spoke about his government’s decision to offer oil, salt and sugar from December to March 2022 in addition to grains and pulses free of charge to households headed by women and to antyodaya card holders.Another leader said the PM exhorted the party functionaries and ministers to “not ignore or overlook” the workers who form the backbone of the party. “He asked them to remain accessible to them and also address their concerns,” the leader said, asking not to be named.Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the 18-point political resolution applauded the achievements of the Modi government on several fronts, including the work done during the pandemic, the vaccination programme, India’s fresh commitments made at COP26, the developments taking place in Jammu and Kashmir following the reading down of Article 370 and on the foreign policy front.The resolution appreciated the Modi government for delivering corruption-free governance with emphasis on digital payments and transparency, Sitharaman said. She said the resolution that was moved by the UP CM and seconded by the president of the Tamil Nadu unit, K Annamalai, appreciated the “methodical way” in which India’s image was shaped abroad and also condemned how the Opposition indulged in politics of opportunism.“The opposition parties were absent during the pandemic but confined themselves to Twitter to spread suspicion (about the vaccine) and spread conspiracies,” she said.Referring to the post-poll violence in West Bengal, Sitharaman said: “The party is committed to stand with every party worker and shall seek justice through the court.”On the issue of the continuing famers agitation in poll-bound Punjab, in parts of UP and Haryana, and the demand to repeal the farm laws passed in Parliament, she said the Union government is ready for discussions with the protesting farmers but they have not been able to explain what their objections are.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjps-nec-meet-discusses-polls-wb-violence-and-modi-s-leadership-101636309011976.html
08-11-2021||India||CBI seeks US help in Sushant Singh Rajput death case||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has approached the United States through a formal channel, seeking assistance in retrieving deleted data from the email and social media accounts of actor Sushant Singh Rajput to understand if anything happened in the past which could be linked to June 14, 2020, the day he was found dead at his apartment in Mumbai, people familiar with the development said.The information has been sought under MLAT (mutual legal assistance treaty) from California-headquartered Google and Facebook, asking them to share details of all deleted chats, emails or posts of the actor so that investigators can analyse the content.India and the US have an MLAT under which both sides can gain access to information in any domestic investigation, which otherwise may not be possible. While the ministry of home affairs (MHA) is the central authority in India for receiving or sharing such information under MLAT, the attorney general’s office processes such information in the US.An officer, who didn’t want to be named, said: “We don’t want to leave any loose ends before we finalise the case. We want to know if there are any particular deleted chats or posts which could be useful in the case.”The development means that finalising the probe in Sushant Singh’s death may take some more time as sharing information through MLATs is a time-consuming process.The premier agency explained last year through a statement that it is probing the case from all angles. Among the angles it is exploring are abetment of suicide charges against Rhea Chakraborty, as alleged by Rajput’s family; and whether the actor took the step under any professional pressure, nepotism in Bollywood, etc. “Sending the request to the US is part of that exercise only as we don’t want to miss out on any aspect,” said a second officer, asking not to be named.Senior advocate Vikas Singh, who represents Sushant Singh’s family, appreciated CBI sending a request to Google and Facebook. He said: “I am not surprised because they (CBI) want to do a thorough investigation before they finalise the case. There is a lot of mystery behind Sushant Singh’s death like there are no eyewitnesses, or camera footage to show what happened and I think that CBI is trying to find a proper lead.”As reported by HT on June 14 this year, the CBI, with the help of experts, is also carrying out a detailed psychiatric evaluation to assess Singh’s state of mind prior to his death. It has also examined the reports shared by the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL).The 34-year-old actor was found dead in his apartment in Mumbai’s Bandra on June 14 last year. Rajput’s father, KK Singh, lodged a complaint with the Patna police against Rhea Chakraborty, her parents and her brother, Showik, on June 25. The CBI took over the probe in August 2020 on orders of the Supreme Court. Two other agencies — the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) — are also investigating different aspects in the case.A medical board of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) had concluded in September 2020, after studying the post-mortem exam and viscera reports, that the actor’s death was a case of suicide. The Mumbai Police, which initially probed the death, had also ruled out any foul play.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-seeks-us-help-in-sushant-singh-rajput-death-case-101636308949965.html
08-11-2021||India||Modi urges BJP workers to ‘connect’ with people||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday urged the Bharatiya Janata Party workers to become a “bridge of faith” between the party and the people and said they must forge ties with the people based on the party’s guiding values of “service, resolve and sacrifice”.In his 50-minute valedictory address at the party’s national executive committee meeting that comes ahead of the assembly elections in a clutch of states next year, the PM said to be able to win the trust of the people, the party workers must come up with a “constructive, humane and holistic” approach of connecting with the masses.“The PM spoke about the need to be in constant contact with the common people, of adopting a humane approach. He also said that the work that was undertaken by the party during the Covid pandemic will show results years from now, and the party will benefit from the exemplary work that was done during this period just as the party is now reaping the benefits of the work that was put in by senior leaders in the past,” said a senior party leader on condition of anonymity.The PM was referring to the work undertaken by the party during the pandemic, under its Seva Hi Sangathan (organisation means service) programme that set targets for distributing food, ration, medicines, and other necessities to people.Underlining the importance of selfless service and pro-people policies, he said the account of work that was presented by the chief ministers of four poll-bound BJP-ruled states is an indicator that they will succeed in winning the trust of the people. The CMs of the four states made a presentation on the accomplishments of their government at the meeting.Addressing the media after the Prime Minister’s address, Union minister Bhupendra Yadav said, “…Based on the presentations made by the CMs of the states that will go to polls in 2022, the Prime Minister expressed confidence that the BJP will get the blessings of the people.”Of the five states that will pick new assemblies, BJP is in power in four —Manipur, Goa, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. The fifth state, Punjab, will see the BJP contest all the seats for the first time on its own after breaking up with its long-term ally, the Shiromani Akali Dal.The PM also took a dig at the Congress and said that, unlike the opposition party that is centred around a dynasty, the BJP has grown based on its values of service, resolution and sacrifice.Quoting the PM, Yadav said, “The Prime Minister in his inspirational speech said that the BJP at the Centre has created a space for itself because of being connected to the common people. It is not a dynastic party but has worked with the values of seva (service), sankalp (resolve) and samarpan (sacrifice).”The PM also urged the workers to seek inspiration from the work done by the party seniors that has been added as a new segment, Kamal Pushp, on the NAMO app. He told the workers that it is incumbent on them to take forward the work done by the seniors to ensure that the party goes from strength to strength.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-urges-bjp-workers-to-connect-with-people-101636308411823.html
