Khursheed said that the Congress was with the aggrieved family in all circumstances and would take the matter to the high court or Supreme Court if required. Khursheed, who met Altaf’s family in Kasganj, said, “The family of Altaf deserves justice and for this an FIR needs to be filed on their behalf. The Congress is with the family and there will be no laxity even if the matter is taken to the high court or Supreme Court. The Congress will do whatever is required.” “The father of Altaf is in poor health while mother is also not fit. Family members are not in a position to state their agonies. The party high command has sent me to communicate with them and assure them that the Congress stands by them,” he said. Earlier, Congress leader Rashid Alvi also visited the family and said that since the matter pertained to a murder, an FIR should be registered against the guilty cops. “The father of Altaf is under pressure of local administration and because of this he was compelled to state that it was case of suicide when in fact it was a case of murder,” said Alvi who added that he was here on the direction of party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and would report back to her. “The father is very frightened. Altaf was the bread earner for the family. The local administration has pressurized his father Chand Mian to give a clean chit to the police. The guilty cops need to be behind the bars,” Alvi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/kasganj-custodial-death-congress-assures-all-support-to-victim-s-family-101636741665459.html
12-11-2021||Gurugram||2 men held for killing property dealer in Faridabad, 2 still on the run||Faridabad police on Thursday arrested two men for allegedly killing a 42-year-old property dealer over a monetary dispute in Jawahar Colony on Wednesday. Police said they were looking for two other suspects who were on the run. Police said the incident took place at about 10.30pm when the victim, Bhagat Singh, was walking to his house after purchasing milk from a nearby grocery store. As he exited a lane near his house, the four suspects allegedly intercepted him and started hitting him with rods and sticks. Narender Kadiyan, deputy commissioner of police (crime), said that Ranjit Singh, Bhagat’s brother, told them Bhagat raised an alarm, following which he rushed out and witnessed four people assaulting him. “They threatened him against interfering. He informed the police and his neighbours, and the suspects fled from the spot,” Kadiyan said. Police said Bhagat suffered injuries on the head and neck, and collapsed on the spot within minutes. His family members took him to a private hospital where doctors declared him dead on arrival, said police. Kadiyan said they formed teams on Wednesday night after the murder, and identified the suspects through technical surveillance and statements recorded by the family members. Two suspects were arrested from Sector 20B of Faridabad on Thursday night and were identified as Gurmeet Singh and Babu aka Nishant (known by his first name only). Kadiyan said during questioning the suspects revealed that Bhagat had allegedly borrowed money from them and was not returning it despite repeated requests. “The suspects had approached his family members also but they refused to help. Bhagat had stopped answering their calls and was avoiding them, following which they planned to attack to threaten him, but he died,” he said. Police said the suspects had threatened him earlier as well, but he assured them he would return the money within a month. However, he then stopped taking calls. The iron rod and sticks used in the crime have been recovered by the police. The suspects were sent to judicial custody on Friday, said police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/2-men-held-for-killing-property-dealer-in-faridabad-2-still-on-the-run-101636741306472.html
12-11-2021||Mumbai||Birth certificate is from BMC record: Nawab Malik to high court in defamation suit||The Bombay high court (HC) on Friday reserved its order on a limited plea by Dnyandev Wankhede, who sought an injunction against Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Nawab Malik from making defamatory posts or comments against him or his family on any form of media.Wankhede filed a defamation suit seeking damages of ₹1.25 crore against Malik last week. He claimed that Malik’s statements made on social media publishing platform, and in various press conferences, “caused harm to him and his family”, which includes son Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) zonal director Sameer Wankhede.Wankhede’s lawyer Arshad Shaikh told the HC that the documents posted by Malik were not public documents, and Malik had violated their right to privacy by posting them in the public domain without duly verifying them.However, Malik’s advocate Atul Damle said that the injunction could only be limited to the allegations made against Dnyandev and not to his family members, who could approach the court for remedy if they so wished. He added that most documents referred to by Malik were either from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) records or from the social media accounts of members of the Wankhede family itself, reasonable verification was done before posting them.  “Verification is of some importance. The verification of an MLA has to be of a different level,” the single-judge bench of justice Madhav Jamdar observed. The court concluded hearing and reserved it for orders. On October 25, Malik tweeted a copy of a birth certificate, purported to be Sameer Wankhede’s, which showed his father’s name as “Dawood K Wankhede” with an asterix mark that pointed to a name scribbled on the side of the certificate, which read “Dnyandev Kachruji Wankhede”. Malik further alleged that Sameer had forged a caste certificate to get a position in the Indian Revenue Service and that his family is Muslim.Both father and son have denied these allegations.Shaikh quoted an apex court order that stated that no one could publish anything pertaining to marriage or divorce without the consent of the concerned person whether it is truth or otherwise. “If he does so he will be violating the right to privacy,” Shaikh said. Shaikh also said that Malik’s allegations of extortion by Sameer Wankhede tarnished the image of the family and thus Malik and his party members should be restrained from posting or commenting on anything pertaining to them on any media. Wankhede’s lawyer argued that Malik’s claims were baseless as all official documents of his son and family members identified him (Dnyandev) as a Hindu who belonged to the Mahar community. The court had asked Shaikh in a previous hearing to file an affidavit to show how Malik’s posts caused harm to him. Shaikh submitted that the affidavit filed by Wankhede consisted of 28 documents which proved that his name was Dnyandev and not ‘Dawood’ as claimed by Malik. The documents included caste certificate, passport, statement of marks, degree certificate and police service records as well. Shaikh submitted that the documents of Sameer’s mother and sister also showed his father’s name as Dnyandev. Even Sameer’s school leaving certificate showed his father’s name as Dnyandev. The court had also asked Malik to file an affidavit stating that he had verified the documents and material pertaining to Sameer Wankhede posted on social media. Malik’s affidavit stated that he had reasonably verified the documents before posting them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/birth-certificate-is-from-bmc-record-nawab-malik-to-high-court-in-defamation-suit-101636741305044.html
12-11-2021||Gurugram||Low wind speed, dip in temperature push Gurugram pollution into ‘severe’ category||A combination of low wind speed, dip in temperature and farm fires led to a steep rise in pollutants on Friday, with Gurugram recording an Air Quality Index (AQI) reading of 448 in the “severe” category. This is a deterioration from an AQI reading of 378 in the “very poor” category a day before, according to official data.In fact, all four air quality monitoring stations in Gurugram recorded “severe” air quality on Friday--the TERI Gram station recorded an AQI reading of 430, the Gwal Pahari station recorded 430, the Vikas Sadan station near mini-secretariat recorded 452, and the Sector 51 station recorded 447.An AQI reading between 0 and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.Gurugram’s air quality plummetted into the “very poor” AQI on Diwali, which was celebrated on November 4, and the day after. For three consecutive days after, Gurugram had a “severe” AQI, which implies that the air quality is hazardous and may cause respiratory effects even to healthy people and serious health impacts to people with lung or heart diseases. Gurugram’s air improved slightly to “very poor” on November 9, and has now deteriorated again into the “severe” category.The Haryana Pollution Control Board said the Commission of Air Quality Management met on Friday to discuss measures to combat the situation and is likely to announce certain measures on Saturday. Officials also said that all steps recommended to combat “severe” air pollution are already in effect and they are keeping a watch on the situation.The Haryana Pollution Control Board said that they have implemented Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) measures and all steps required to meet the “severe” AQI have been put in place. “A meeting on the emerging situation was held on Friday and additional measures to curb pollution are likely to be announced soon,” said S Narayanan, member-secretary, Haryana Pollution Control Board.Even as government officials mulled different strategies to manage the pollution situation, experts on Friday said that people in Delhi-NCR were facing an air emergency and the situation was likely to deteriorate further as pollutants were not going to dissipate soon.“The wind is very calm and the temperature has also dipped, while the number of farm fires has increased this year as compared to last two years. A few days ago, the situation had relatively improved because of a depression in the Bay of Bengal. The wind had caused a dissipation of pollutants. But for the next 15 to 20 days, no change in weather is likely, which will make things worse,” said Dr Anurani Sharma, associate professor, Teri School of Advanced Studies.According to the experts, the low temperature and lack of wind create an inversion layer resulting in the non-dissipation of pollutants, which remain stagnant within the atmospheric boundary layer. “This is what is happening in Delhi-NCR and there is likely to be no let-up in pollution. To improve the situation, the government should work on reducing local-level pollution,” said Dr Sharma.According to the India Meteorological Department, the temperature is likely to dip further as snowy winds from northernmost states like Himachal Pradesh and Jammu Kashmir reach the plains. On Friday, the maximum temperature of Gurugram was 28 degrees Celsius and the minimum temperature was 13.4 degrees Celsius.Air quality experts, meanwhile, said that immediate steps were required to curb vehicular, construction-related, and industrial pollution. “A substantial amount of pollution in Delhi-NCR is caused by vehicles and it is time emergency measures were taken to reduce it. Construction sites must be inspected and all materials covered. Fuels which are not clean should not be allowed to be used by industries,” said Anumita Roy Choudhary, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment.She also called upon people to refrain from waste burning and ensure that they remain indoors and don’t get exposed to pollutants. “The government must take immediate measures in Delhi and other NCR districts,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/low-wind-speed-dip-in-temperature-push-gurugram-pollution-into-severe-category-101636741125056.html
12-11-2021||Mumbai||Police personnel worked 58 more days than other govt employees, should get extra salary: DGP tells state||The director-general of police (DGP) Sanjay Pandey has sent a proposal to the state government requesting them to pay police personnel in the state a month’s additional salary, as throughout the year they have worked on public and government holidays, without leaves. The DGP cited examples of other states that pay their police personnel one month’s additional salary every year as an incentive allowance. Pandey on Wednesday wrote to the additional chief secretary (home), requesting him that the police personnel should get one month’s salary (basic pay+ dearness allowance) as incentive allowance. His letter (of which a copy is with HT) states, “To maintain law and order, the police personnel have to remain present on duty even on government holidays as well as public holidays. As a result, they are not allowed to take public holidays like other government employees. Hence, they must be compensated.” According to police officers, there are in all 137 government leaves allotted to government employees every year. But, the police personnel get only a total of 79 days, including 52 government holidays, 15 days of additional leaves, four days of miscellaneous leaves and others. The additional leaves that the police personnel get are valid only for that particular year. If these leaves are not utilised or encashed, they get lapsed, an officer said. According to the DGP’s proposal, on average an officer works additional 58 days every year, if compared to other government employees. The working hours of police personnel are also longer than those of other government employees and the nature of their work is stressful and exhausting. In Punjab, incentive allowance is given to police personnel for working on public holidays. Similarly, other states like Orissa, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Mizoram and Haryana too give one month’s salary along with additional leaves as incentive allowance, cites the proposal. On the same ground, the policemen in Maharashtra should also get this incentive allowance, Pandey requested in his letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/police-personnel-worked-58-more-days-than-other-govt-employees-should-get-extra-salary-dgp-tells-state-101636741065103.html
12-11-2021||Mumbai||As admissions dip, some Mumbai hospitals want to be fully ‘non-Covid’ facilities again||With Covid-19 cases on a steep decline, some hospitals in Mumbai were hopeful of going back to being fully non-Covid facilities. However, in a joint meeting of private hospitals held last week, though it was decided to reduce the beds meant for Covid-19 patients, the authorities agreed to have a system wherein the entire bed strength can be activated if the cases witness a sudden surge. “A few hospitals were keen on removing the Covid-19 beds completely and convert into fully non-Covid facilities. But it was jointly decided that we simply reduce the bed strength and utilise them for non-Covid patients, if needed. However, the conversion [into a non-Covid facility] should be in such a way that the beds can be reverted for Covid-19, if a surge happens,” said Dr Gautam Bhansali, chief coordinator for private hospitals and the civic body. Dr Bhansali cited an example of Bombay Hospital, where he practices. The hospital had 122 Covid-19 beds, of which only 20 have been kept functional now. “The remaining beds can be activated as soon as the demand arises,” he said. “A majority of the public hospitals have now fully resumed non-Covid work. It is only logical to allow all private hospitals to utilise their bed strength for non-Covid patients,” said Dr Deepak Baid, former president of the Association of Medical Consultants. The civic-run Rajawadi Hospital has reduced its Covid-19 wards from four to one. Other public hospitals have also started using most of their bed strength for non-Covid patients. Of the 15,582 Covid beds in the city, 14,326 were vacant on Friday, according to the civic body dashboard. Mumbai’s daily Covid-19 cases now hover between 200 and 300. The hospital admissions have drastically come down too. “But we have to exercise caution as many other countries are already seeing a spurt. We may also see a similar rise in cases after December,” said Dr Bhansali. Members of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force have also said that a third wave is likely between December and January. In May 2020, the Maharashtra government had invoked five laws to cap the prices of private hospitals owing to the pandemic. The state further extended the cap during the second wave as well. Currently, Mumbai has the 80:20 rule, wherein 80% of Covid-19 patients have to be charged as per the state’s capped prices, while 20% can be charged according to the private rates. “With hardly any admissions, the hospitals are leaving the patients to choose whether they wish to opt for state rates or go for upgraded rooms at private rates. But not all are aware about such a price cap,” said a doctor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/as-admissions-dip-some-mumbai-hospitals-want-to-be-fully-non-covid-facilities-again-101636740826840.html
12-11-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra education dept to refund only 21% of board exam fees||Maharashtra State Board for Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE) will refund only 20.85% of the nearly ₹104 crore collected as exam fees from approximately 2.9 million secondary school certificate (SSC, Class 10) and higher secondary certificate (HSC, Class 12) students for academic year 2020-21. The Bombay high court on July 29 this year directed the state government to consider refunding exam fees after board exams were cancelled on account of the Covid-19 pandemic. SSC students paid ₹315 each as exam fee, of which the board will refund ₹59, or 18.73% of the original fees. Similarly, HSC students paid ₹415 each, but the board plans to return ₹94, or 22.65%. The decision to refund the fees was notified by MSBSHSE on November 11, three and a half months after a July 29 order by Bombay high court asking the state government to consider returning students’ money. A senior state education board official said that while no board exams were conducted in 2021, the state board was asked to prepare for a common entrance test (CET) for all class 10 students aiming for seats in first year junior college (FYJC). “Even though eventually the CET was also scrapped, the state board had already invested in the software as well as paid for exam papers to be set in advance. We had to pay for work already done which was deducted from the exam fees paid by the students. The remaining fund is being disbursed to students,” the senior official said on condition of anonymity as he is not authorised to speak to the media. The notification states, “Both SSC and HSC exams were scrapped this year due to increasing Covid-19 cases. Following the Bombay HC order, the state board has decided to refund exam fee amount to respective students.” It adds that to get the money, students will have to visit mahahsscboard.in and fill in information of individual students on the provided links on the website starting Friday, November 12. In July, a retired school principal from Sangli district filed a petition in the Bombay HC questioning the state board’s decision to not refund exam fees to students. The petitioner had highlighted how like every year, MSBSHSE charged exam fees from 1.575 million SSC and 1.319 million HSC students in the 2020-21 academic year. This amounts to around ₹104 crore, which the petition highlighted should be returned to students as no exam was held. “The exam fee is charged to cover charges for paper setters, invigilators, paper assessment, transportation of question-and-answer booklets, printing costs, etc. No such activity was undertaken in 2021 due to the initial delay and eventual scrapping of exams. Therefore, there is no need for the state board to retain such a large sum of money,” said a Mumbai teacher who is also part of a teaching and non-teaching staff union in the city. Activist and parent Manisha Pawar said, “This is a joke. No exam was conducted, and even the online CET was not confirmed. For the state board to claim they’ve invested money on this cannot be believed. The board should be held for contempt of court for not following the Bombay HC orders in true spirit.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-education-dept-to-refund-only-21-of-board-exam-fees-101636740764999.html

12-11-2021||Delhi||NDMC opens its first toy bank for underprivileged children at Bapu Dham||The New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) opened a toy bank at Bapu Dham creche in Chanakyapuri here on Friday with the aim to provide toys to underprivileged children. Dr Ramesh Kumar, NDMC’s medical officer (health), who inaugurated the toy-bank, said toy banks all over the world work on the principle of ‘recycle toys, recycle smiles’. “All children should have an opportunity to play with toys, since they stimulate mental and emotional intelligence. Since toys are instrumental in mental development of children, this toy bank is for underprivileged children in the area, who cannot afford to buy toys,” he said. Kumar further said the initiative will help bring a smile on children’s faces. “It will also reduce waste generation as the old and unused toys, which otherwise get discarded, will be reused.The bank will also promote reuse of goods and articles and reduce wastage of toys, mostly made up of plastic and fur,” he said. Kumar also said more such banks will be opened in the NDMC area, where people can donate toys. He also urged people to participate in the drive so that they can help in making the environment cleaner. On December 26 last year, the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) also opened a first-of-its-kind toy bank in the Najafgarh zone for children who can’t afford them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ndmc-opens-its-first-toy-bank-for-underprivileged-children-at-bapu-dham-101636740466206.html
12-11-2021||Pune||Pune RTO collects ₹3,386,400 in fines from people without PUC certificates||PUNE The Regional Transport Office (RTO), Pune, has collected ₹3,386,400 in fines from 3,386 vehicle owners in the last three years for not carrying pollution under control (PUC) certificates.One has to pay ₹1,000 if the vehicle does not have a PUC certificate.“After the process of acquiring PUC certificates went online, more people have become active in getting certificates. Even old vehicles (older by more than 15 years) which need re-registration need to have PUC certificates. If one does not have a PUC then one cannot do registration of their vehicle,” said Sanjeev Bhor, deputy regional transport officer.The PUC vans are deputed at petrol pumps and highways which makes easy access for people to get the certificates.“When a person is caught for PUC violation– an online memo is generated and all the documents are checked, whichever document is missing for that fine is collected,” added Bhor.The number of violations has increased in the last six months (April-October) with RTO officials on duty penalising 1,114 people and collecting ₹11,14,000 in fines.“We get three-four people in a day who don’t have or carry the PUC certificate or have not renewed it. Since many colleges have not started offline classes, the numbers of youth coming for getting certificates are less,” said Suraj Gokhale, whose PUC van is placed on Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) circle road.With air quality deterioration being high during the winter season, authorities are making sure vehicles in core areas of the city do not add up to the increase in pollution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-rto-collects-rs-3-386-400-in-fines-from-people-without-puc-certificates-101636739985056.html

12-11-2021||Noida||With AQI at 488, Noida overtakes Ghaziabad to be most polluted city in India||Ghaziabad, Greater Noida and Noida experienced the worst pollution levels this season as the air quality index (AQI) spiked to the higher end of the ‘severe’ category on Friday. According to the AQI bulletin released by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), with an AQI of 488, Noida was the most polluted city in the country on Friday, a spot occupied by Ghaziabad on at least seven days this season. On Friday, the AQI in Ghaziabad was 486, making it the second most polluted city. The pollution levels in Greater Noida were no better with the city recording an AQI of 478. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.It is the second time this season, ever since the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) was implemented on October 15, that Noida has emerged as the most polluted in the country. The last time the city was this polluted was on November 5, a day after Diwali. On the other hand, Ghaziabad was the most polluted in the country on seven days-- October 16, 29, November 1, 2, 6, 10 and 11.  Since November 4--the day Diwali was celebrated, Ghaziabad has been experiencing ‘severe’ air for nine days till Friday (November 12). In comparison, Noida has had eight days of ‘severe’ air, barring November 10, while Greater Noida had five such days. “The entire Ghaziabad/Noida region has seen considerable spike in pollution levels due to the inversion layer, which has come down due to low temperature. As a result, the dispersion of pollutants, including those from external sources as well as local sources, is becoming difficult. This is why there is a spike in pollution levels and this phase may last for a couple of days as the mercury is likely to drop further,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board, Ghaziabad. “The north westerly winds are bringing in the stubble fires from neighbouring states, which was about 35% (on Friday) with no decline in fire counts. On our part, we have asked the local agencies to increase water sprinkling and road sweeping to control dust, which causes spike in PM10 levels,” said Sharma. According to the CPCB records, all the four air quality monitoring stations each in Noida and Ghaziabad, besides the two in Greater Noida, touched the 500-mark for PM2.5 concentrations in past 24 hours ending on Friday. Officials said that the PM2.5 concentrations are this high due to low temperatures at night. The forecast by the System of air quality and weather forecasting and research (Safar) on Friday said that ‘severe’ pollution is likely to be there on Saturday due to increase in stubble related fire counts and increase in transport level wind speed at night. “The effective fire count increased to 4,056 today (Friday). Today’s share of crop residue burning is about 35% in PM2.5. Drop in minimum temperature is likely for the next two days resulting in air quality to be in ‘severe’ to upper end of ‘very poor’ category,” the Safar forecast said on Friday. The sub-committee of the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM), after a meeting on November 12, directed the concerned states and implementing agencies to be ready for implementation of measures listed under the ‘emergency’ category of the Grap. The committee directed that its previous orders of November 8 about measures under the ‘severe’ category of Grap should be followed stringently. It also advised all the government/private and other establishment to reduce vehicle usage by at least 30% by way of encouraging work from home, car-pooling and optimising the field activities. It has also advised people to limit outdoor activities and minimise exposure. Officials of the committee said the air quality exceeded the threshold limit of 500 micrograms per cubic metre (mpcm) for PM10 and 300 mpcm for PM2.5 at 01.00 hours and 03.00 hours on Friday. They also said meteorological conditions for dispersal of pollutants will be highly unfavourable till November 18.The deteriorating air quality in the region is spelling horror for residents who are struggling with a host of respiratory issues. “I developed severe asthma attack early Friday morning. One of my friends rushed me to the hospital, where I was given immediate treatment, including injections. I have been facing difficulty in breathing due to the high pollution levels,” said Anil Kumar, one of the patients in the out-patient department of Sanjay Nagar Combined District Hospital in Ghaziabad. Health experts said people who have asthma problems and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are having respiratory issues due to high level of pollution. “We have to increase the dose of medicine for such patients. There are many others, whose condition is getting worse and need hospitalisation. There are young patients who travel a lot and have developed issues such as bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infections and allergies,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, former president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad chapter). “Since Diwali, there has been a 60-70% increase in the number of patients coming in with respiratory problems and the numbers have not declined. It is advisable for people to wear N-95 mask, which provides better protection against pollutants, or a medical mask in case the N-95 mask is not available. We also advise people, who are immuno-compromised, to take up flu vaccination (yearly) and pneumococcal vaccination which is taken once in every five years,” Dr Agarwal added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/with-aqi-at-488-noida-overtakes-ghaziabad-to-be-most-polluted-city-in-india-101636739685147.html

The team reached the area around 10am on Friday and demolished four rooms, and other structures built to keep fodder for animals, on the land.Pal, however, said that it was his “ancestral land and it belonged to him”. He and his family members resisted the demolition, and soon other local farmers joined them and started shouting slogans against the Noida authority.“This is my ancestral land. It does not belong to the Noida authority. It is trying to acquire my land forcefully,” said Pal.Around 11:30am, farmer leaders from Bhartiya Kisan Parishad (BKP) reached the site in protest.Seeing that the situation was getting heated up, the team left the site, and police filed an FIR against Pal in the local police station.Reacting to this, the angry farmers at the spot started rebuilding the already demolished structures there. “We started reconstructing the house of the farmer, who is the rightful owner of the land and the house. We have reconstructed walls, and the farmer’s house will be reconstructed as before at the earliest... The Noida authority is playing with fire, it is destroying the lives of farmers... We have decided to protest against the authority at Noida Sector 6 from Monday, to protect the rights of the farmers,” said Ashok Chauhan, a BKP leader.BKP has been protesting against the Noida authority since September 1 this year, at a community centre in Harola village near Sector 6, and also disrupting construction work at different sites, led by the Noida authority. “Now, we will start protesting right in front of the gate of the authority’s office... The authority officials are not in the mood to work for the farmers’ welfare,” said Sukhbir Yadav, BKP president.Meanwhile, the Noida authority said on Friday that it will visit the site again and remove the farmer’s illegal structure to free the government land. “We demolished the structure because it is built on government land. It does not belong to Pal. If the structure is being rebuilt, action will be taken against the people concerned, according to the law. We took a lawful action against the famer, and we will continue to do so. We will inquire into Pal’s claims and act accordingly,” said Praveen Mishra, additional chief executive officer of the Noida authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/noida-officials-police-halt-house-demolition-drive-midway-as-farmers-protest-101636739086418.html
12-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi HC dismisses plea against DU considering only Class 12 marks for admissions||New Delhi The Delhi high court on Friday dismissed a plea by the Delhi University Students Union (DUSU) challenging the varsity decision to consider only class 12 marks while admitting students from the Kerala state board. Students in the Kerala board are graded combining the marks of class 11 and 12.A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh dismissed the plea saying it was “highly belated” and was devoid of merit.“They have changed it, so changed it, how can anyone grutch about it… If you don’t want to read the clear writing on the wall, then that is your choice,” the bench said while taking note of an admission bulletin, issued by the university in June, which said that if a candidate’s mark sheet contains both class 11 and 12 marks, (s)he shall be admitted only on the basis of the class 12 marks.DUSU, in its plea, said it was approaching the high court against the “arbitrary, irrational and unfair conduct” of authorities that have violated the fundamental and legal rights of innumerable students.It said that in terms of the consistent policy, certain state boards, including the Directorate of General Education (Higher Secondary Wing), Government of Kerala, gives a consolidated mark sheet of both class 11 and 12 marks. The policy explicitly states that to determine grades of students, combined marks of both 11 and 12 shall be considered, it said.Advocate Ashish Dixit, representing DUSU, said the Delhi University for several years correspondingly incorporated provisions in the admission bulletin stating that in cases where state boards publish marks of both 11th and 12th standards, the merit of students shall be determined based on such consolidated mark sheets.However, the Delhi University has unilaterally and arbitrarily decided in its admission process of 2021-2022 that students would be admitted only on the basis of class 12 marks, he said adding that when the admissions began for the sessions 2021-2022, the colleges raised and conveyed objections concerning mark sheets containing marks of both class 11 and 12.The plea was opposed by Delhi University’s counsel M Rupal who questioned DUSU’s locus standi to file the petition since the union only represented students of Delhi University and not those who are yet to take admissions.He further said the admission bulletin was issued by the varsity in June and the petitioner approached the court in October, which was highly belated.However, Dixit said the issue was first highlighted on October 4, then a representation was made to the vice-chancellor on October 9 but to date, no decision has been taken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hc-dismisses-plea-against-du-considering-only-class-12-marks-for-admissions-101636738905043.html

12-11-2021||Noida||No need for ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ campaign in Gautam Budh Nagar: Health officials||The ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ vaccination campaign launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to accelerate and sustain vaccination momentum will not be taken up extensively in Gautam Budh Nagar as officials here claim to have administered the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine to more beneficiaries than the targeted population. The nationwide campaign was launched on November 3 and a government order dated November 5 from the National Health Mission stated a comprehensive action plan to be followed by all states/Union Territories till November 30. “We have already covered 120% of the targeted population with the first dose of Covid 19 vaccine in the district. The action plan detailed in the government order is for those districts, whose vaccination coverage percentage is lower than the state average. We have already administered the first dose to 18 lakh beneficiaries against a target of inoculating 15 lakh people,” said Dr Neeraj Tyagi, district immunisation officer, Gautam Budh Nagar. The first-dose vaccination has crossed 100% as several people from other districts and a migrating population have also been vaccinated in Gautam Budh Nagar.The action points mentioned in the government order include creation of multiple vaccination teams or ‘vaccination toli’ to ensure 100% vaccination coverage in a targeted geographical area, intra-state competitions to administer maximum number of doses in 24 hours, local ‘bazaar haats’ to create awareness, utilization of social media for same and taking help of local influential personalities to encourage people to take the jab. Apart from this, the order also directs districts to approach the ‘missed-out’ and ‘left-out’ beneficiaries and ensure they are vaccinated. “We have been carrying out cluster sessions of vaccination across the district regularly. The health department’s local Asha and ANM workers mobilize those who have not been vaccinated yet. During these cluster sessions, over 80 government Covid vaccination centres conduct inoculation sessions; no slot booking is required here,” said Tyagi. Though the district has officially vaccinated all of its population with the first dose, there are still many who have been left out of the vaccination programme, admitted Tyagi. “There are still around 15,000 people in the 60+ age group, who have not yet been vaccinated. According to official records, all the beneficiaries in the 45-59 age group have been jabbed with the first dose. The health department is working to ensure the remaining get vaccinated," said Tyagi. District magistrate Suhas L Y said some people have been left out of the vaccination programme because of regular movement of migrants and residents.“Since Gautam Budh Nagar is an urban district, there is a large floating population here. This is why even though we have administered more beneficiaries than the targeted population with the first dose, there are still many in the district who have been left out. Vaccinations have been going on smoothly as we have a target of vaccinating 10,000 beneficiaries each day,” said Suhas. The chief medical officer did not respond to calls and messages for comment. So far, the district has vaccinated total 28,54,110 people, of whom 18,22,525 have received the first dose while 10,31,585 people are fully vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/no-need-for-har-ghar-dastak-campaign-in-gautam-budh-nagar-health-officials-101636738364913.html

Earlier the PWD had estimated that work valued at ₹4.5 crore was pending with regards to fire safety, primarily in the old buildings of the hospital campus. At any given point of time there are hundreds of patients admitted and thousands working to keep the hospital and the BJ Medical college functioning.Dr Vinayak Kale, dean of the BJ Medical college and Sassoon General said, “The revised proposal is being prepared as per the norms of the National Safety Council. The earlier one which we had prepared was as per another agency. The PMRDA has revised estimates as per the norms of the NSC. The new NSC order came in just a month ago and we are now working on the new order.”When asked why the earlier fire safety proposal was not put in place Dr Kale said that while the hospital had sent the earlier proposal it had not been accepted at the time due to certain rectifications that were needed, which were later met. “By the time the proposal could be accepted the central government made it mandatory for all hospitals to work on fire compliance as per the National Safety Council,” Dr Kale said. A senior official from the hospital requesting anonymity said, “There was a review by the commissioner of medical education on Wednesday and additional information has been sent on Thursday. Revised estimates were submitted on Friday. The revision was necessitated to comply with the fire safety audit conducted by the agency appointed by the government, while the earlier one was prepared by the PWD electrical department. The revision is under process to comply with the standards set by this new government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/sassoon-hospital-s-fire-compliance-stuck-due-to-revision-of-norms-estimates-101636738306318.html
12-11-2021||Delhi||What was the offence in housing Tablighi Jamaat attendees, HC asks police||The Delhi high court on Friday rebuked the Delhi Police for registering FIRs against Indian nationals who provided accommodation to foreign attendees of the Tablighi Jamaat congregation at the Markaz Nizamuddin at the start of the Covid-19 lockdown in March 2020, and asked the police to state what offence these individuals had committed in giving shelter at a time when no one could move anywhere.Justice Mukta Gupta’s remarks come while hearing a plea by 60 Delhi residents seeking to quash FIRs registered against them for allowing Tablighi Jamaat attendees to live in mosques or their homes. She said Jamaat attendees sought refuge in homes and mosques before the lockdown came into effect and nobody could go anywhere after it was imposed.“Wherever anybody was residing, the person needed to continue. A person could not even shift if they were with their grandparents, parents… nobody could go out of the house. Wherever you were, you were just suddenly static. So, there was no question of changing the place at that time.When the lockdown was imposed, there was no bar on anybody residing over there,” the court said.It asked the police to state what offence these people had committed by giving shelter to foreigners and those from outside Delhi, and questioned whether there was any notification to throw out such foreigners on to the streets.“Suddenly a lockdown is imposed, where does one go? On the street? He will remain where he is. What is the offence committed? Is there any bar on residents of Madhya Pradesh to come and stay in Delhi or stay in any temple, masjid, gurdwara?” justice Gupta said.“What is the offence? What is the violation? Or was there any notification that everybody will throw out whosoever is staying somewhere,” the judge said.Appearing for the petitioners, their counsel Ashima Mandla told the court that the police had packed the people like sardines in quarantine centres at the beginning of the pandemic in March 2020.She also said three of the 13 FIRs are peculiar because they were against private persons, who were accused of giving refuge in their own homes.In a written reply, the police said Indian nationals “deliberately allowed” foreign nationals to live in mosques or reside in their houses in violation of government notifications which were in effect in March last year.The city police counsel also told the court that the investigating officer of these cases was recently changed and sought time to file a detailed status report.The court granted additional time to file the report and posted the matter for hearing on December 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/what-was-the-offence-in-housing-tablighi-jamaat-attendees-hc-asks-police-101636738304891.html

At least 100 family members, including women, children and elderly people, protested to support the demands made by the workers. “Today, family members of the MSRTC workers staged a protest at the ST colony to show our support to the strike. The state government should understand our condition. Already 36 of our workers died by suicide in last two years due to financial crises and other issues. To resolve these issues making the organisation a state government department is the only answer,” said Swati Bhosale, relative of an MSRTC worker. A Kruti Samiti of unions was formed to have a conversation with the state government, but apparently, the main demand of merging the MSRTC into the state government’s departmental system was compromised. Hence the strike and all 13 depots in the Pune division are closed. So far, 100 workers from the Pune division have been suspended by the MSRTC. Also, restrooms for workers are closed at the Swargate ST stand. “We are going to plan more aggressive protests from next week, if the state government continues not to hear our voices. All 13 depots will remain closed till our demands are fulfilled,” said Santosh Mundhe, a protesting worker. To ease the transport crisis, private tourist bus associations have operated their vehicles from inside theST stands, after government permission.A total of eight private contractor-owned buses were operational from Swargate, Wakdewadi and Pune railway station ST stands offering services to Kolhapur, Aurangabad and Mumbai. “We have started operations of private contractor-operated buses from our ST stands. The number will increase in the coming days and proper police protection is provided to these buses,” said MSRTC Pune divisional controller Ramakant Gaikwad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/families-of-msrtc-workers-join-protests-in-pune-strike-continues-on-day-14-101636737825295.html

Ajay Kumar, station house officer of Surajpur police station, said police registered a case for creating public nuisance against the suspects. “The suspects were released on bail bonds from the police station. They have been told to appear before the court when they get summons,” he said. Greater Noida west residents said police should conduct frequent drives to crack down on people drinking at public places. Sumil Jalota, a resident of La Residentia, said there is a wine shop in Milak Lachi village near Cherry County society where a number of people openly drink in the evening. “It becomes difficult for people, especially women, to go to the market in the evening. We have also found people drinking outside a wine shop near Bisrakh roundabout, about 200 metres away from the police station. Frequent enforcement drive is needed to discipline people,” Jalota said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/40-men-arrested-in-greater-noida-for-drinking-liquor-in-public-101636737587909.html

This time, we will be strict in our approach towards use of combine harvestors by farmers,” said Kumar.He said farmers hiring combine harvestors and those driving it would also have to get prior permission from the districts administration.In Bihar, stubble burning in districts of Kaimur, Rohtas, Bhojpur, Buxar, Nawada and parts of north Bihar has become common over the last few years owing to large-scale use of combine harvestors, the machines that harvest grains in a fast manner, leaving high density of crop residue. Officials say farmers using these machines resort to stubble burning to clean up the crop residue fast so that they can sow their next crop , which leads to high pollution levels and decline in soil quality.Among other steps to be taken to deter farmers from burning stubble are monitoring of farm fires through satellite images on a real-time basis. “ We are procuring satellite images of farm fires on real time basis from the state pollution control board and remote sensing agency, which are being shared with district agricultural officers and DMs,” said another senior official.Sources said the agriculture department is also planning “naming and shaming” of farmers found engaged in stubble burning by putting their names and pictures at the panchayat bhawans, besides stopping their farm incentives through direct benefit transfer( DBT) for three years. Over the last few years, the agriculture department has been pursuing the policy of stopping DBTs to farmers caught in burning stubble. From 2019 to 2021, registration of 2,347 farmers have been blocked for DBT facility in 22 districts, as per latest data of the agricultural department.In Friday’s meeting, DMs were also asked to engage anganwaadi workers, Jeevika volunteers and those associated with rural employment guarantee programme MGNREGA to create awareness on the ill-effects of stubble burning among farmers in the rural areas.

12-11-2021||Patna||JD(U) MLC fuels Jinnah fire in Bihar, RJD, Cong hit back||PATNAThe controversy over Mohammad Ali Jinnah, which started with the statement of Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav, got further fuelled on Friday in Bihar, with ruling Janata Dal (United) legislator Khalid Anwar putting part of the blame for Partition on the Congress as well as Jawahar Lal Nehru.“Jinnah was a great freedom fighter of united India and has great respect in Pakistan. There is no doubt that he was a big leader. He was responsible for the Partition of the country, but no less responsible was the Congress and Pt. Nehru, who became the Prime Minister of India,” Anwar told a TV channel when asked about his views on remarks about Hindutva in Congress leader Salman Khurshid’s book. “I told them that this was the divide and rule politics of the Congress that led to the partition of the country. This is the brand of politics Congress plays and has been playing,” he said.A few days ago, Bihar chief minister had dismissed debates over Jinnah as “irrelevant” . “Did Mahatma Gandhi like Partition? No, he didn’t. It all happened due to the situation that then unfolded. Later, Pakistan also got divided. What is the relevance of discussing about it,” Kumar had said.However, Anwar’s statement triggered immediate reactions. BJP MLC and minister Samrat Choudhary advised those praising Jinnah to shift to Pakistan. “This is a country which prays Mother India and Mahatma Gandhi. Those who want to praise Jinnah should move to Pakistan. There is no place for such elements in India,” he said.Rashtriya Janata Dal leader and Rajya Sabha member Manoj Jha described the debate over Jinnah as “unfortunate” and a reflection of “lack of knowledge about history” just to deviate people’s attention from issues that concern them. “Of late, people who have no sense of history and have not read about freedom movement or how things were shaped, particularly 1945 onwards leading to partition, are trying to pit one great leader against another just to distract people’s attention from core issues. But then, what else you expect when a Padma Shri recipient lady says that the actual freedom India got was in 2014. Another person said India got freedom on 99-year lease. A couple of years ago, a leader described Nathuram Godse as the greatest patriot and she sits in the Parliament. These unfortunate statements tell that we are heading for a disaster “ Jha said.Former Bihar Congress chief Anil Sharma said distorting facts could not change history. “It is established that Jinnah was adamant on Partition, as he wanted a separate Islamic state, while the leadership of the Congress was in the hands of Gandhiji, who had clearly said Partition would happen only over his dead body. Congress cannot be blamed for it by any stretch of imagination. It is just a figment of imagination of some people to take political advantage by distorting historical facts,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/jdu-mlc-fuels-jinnah-fire-in-bihar-rjd-cong-hit-back-101636737465068.html
12-11-2021||Patna||Top Maoist leader held in Jharkhand||PATNATop Maoist leader Prashant Bose alias Kishan Da has been arrested in Jharkhand along with his wife Sheela Marandi, a senior police officer said on Friday.According to the official, Bose and his wife were arrested between Jamshedpur and Saraikela Thursday evening while they were on their way to attend a “secret” meeting.“Bose had suffered paralysis attack and he is unable to move anywhere on his own. His associates were taking him to a safe place but he was nabbed midway,” the officer said, requesting anonymity. Bose, wanted in several criminal cases, is a senior leader of CPI (Maoist)’s central committee and is also the secretary of the outfit’s eastern regional bureau, which includes Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha. The official said Bose has been arrested for the first time and police were trying to work on leads provided by him during interrogation. Police officers, however, are tight-lipped about the prized catch at the moment.While Jamshedpur’s senior superintendent of police (SSP) Dr M Tamil Vanan denied Bose’s arrest in areas under his jurisdiction, Saraikela SP Anand Prakash said on phone said that he would be informed immediately in case Bose is arrested. SM Khopde, additional director general (operations) in Bihar Police, said he came to know of Bose’s arrest from the media but had received no official information from Jharkhand police. In the last five years, no case had been registered against Bose in Bihar, Khopde said, adding that he was collecting information from districts concerned. Bose hails from 24 Parganas district in West Bengal and his wife is also said to be member of the CPI (Maoist)’s central committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/top-maoist-leader-held-in-jharkhand-101636737405279.html
12-11-2021||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh GSDP grows 19.6% in first quarter of 2021-22||Uttar Pradesh’s estimates for the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) show an increase of 19.6% in the first quarter of 2021-22 (April to June 2021) as against the contraction of 22.5% in the corresponding period in 2020-21, according to the State Planning Institute (Economics and Statistics Division), Uttar Pradesh. The GSDP (at constant prices) in the first quarter of 2021-22 is estimated to be ₹2,30,673.02 crore vis-à-vis ₹ 1,92,896.17 crore in the corresponding period in 2020-21. GSDP in the first quarter of 2019-2020 was ₹ 2,57,639.79 crore.The Uttar Pradesh GSDP (at current prices) is estimated to be ₹ 4,05,835 crore in 2021-22. Uttar Pradesh GSDP shrank by nearly 5.9% in 2020-21 following the adverse impact of Covid on the state economy. The estimated increase of 19.6% in the GSDP, therefore, indicates that the Covid-affected economy is recovering in the state but it is yet to reach the pre-pandemic level.“Yes, these estimates show that the state economy has made a sharp recovery in Q1 of 2021-22 after the whopping contraction of 26.2% in GSDP in Q1 and 5.9% in the whole year of FY21. But these estimates have to be seen in the right perspective. Firstly, the high growth of 19.6% in the GSDP is due to “low base effect” as this growth comes over a huge contraction of GSDP in Q1 of 2020-21. Secondly, the loss in GSDP caused by Covid-19 is yet to be fully made up as the GSDP ( ₹ 2,30,673.02 cr) in Q1 of FY 22 is lower by 13.3% compared to the GSDP ( ₹ 2,61,265.50 crore) in the corresponding quarter of pre- pandemic year 2019-20,” said Professor Yashvir Tyagi, former head of the department of economics, Lucknow University. Minister for finance Suresh Khanna, while briefing media persons recently, claimed a consistent increase in the state’s revenue collections and said the UP economy was coming back to near normal. The Gross State Value Added estimates for the period show the highest growth in the secondary sector (40.9%) followed by tertiary (16.3%) and the primary (5.8%) sectors in the first quarter of 2021-22. In 2020-21, the contraction was 4.5% in the primary, 42.9% in the secondary and 22.8% in the tertiary sectors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uttar-pradesh-gsdp-grows-19-6-in-first-quarter-of-202122-101636737344760.html

However, the city also has some Good Samaritans like Sanjay Saran aka Guddu Bhai, a resident of Chatham Lines of Prayagraj, who is providing milk of his over half-a-dozen goats free of cost to around 50 to 70 persons every morning. Prayagraj has so far recorded 891 dengue cases out of which 643 have been reported from urban pockets while the rest 248 are from rural areas. Guddu used to run a tea-shop on the road leading to Iswar Saran Degree College but the pandemic forced him to close the shop and he is barely able to make two ends meet.However, despite facing the challenge, he refrains from charging any money for the milk of his goats. “Earlier, I used to have around 100 goats but now the numbers have come down to just seven but as all of these are yielding milk I thought of donating the same to the needy. Although, I don’t charge for it but there are some who do give some money out of their own free will which I keep to meet the expenses of fodder for my goats,” said 36-year-old Guddu.Guddu has been doing this for the past two months now and as the dengue outbreak is getting worse in the city, more and more people are coming to his house. “I give 100-150 ml of milk to 50-70 people every day as I also want the sick to get well anyhow,” he said. However, medicos of the city do not endorse consuming goat milk for dengue patients.“As far as the standard protocol or the practice goes, in terms of treating dengue patients, there is no scientific proof that goat’s milk has any benefits in increasing the platelet count. Moreover, we never recommend consuming milk without boiling it and people should refrain from doing the same,” said associate professor at MLN Medical College and eminent physician of the city, Dr Manoj Mathur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/prayagrajs-good-samaritan-donates-goat-milk-for-dengue-patients-101636736987662.html

However, the education department has issued guidelines to extend the vacation now till November 22 after the survey is done. Earlier, schools were struggling to get students acquainted with the offline mode. However, now the process is delayed by another week.Before the reopening of schools, teachers are struggling to get the students back on track as offline education begins again.As per the notification issued by the education department late on Thursday evening, Diwali vacations were from October 28 to November 10.Sunanda Wakhare, education officer (secondary), Pune district, said that due to the NAS 2021 two days, November 11 and November 12 the schools will remain functional.“After this, schools are requested to take five more days of leave from November 13 to November 18. After this, on November 19, schools will remain shut due to Guru Nanak Jayanti. And so, all schools will reopen on November 20, which is Saturday,” said Wakhare.As November 21 is Sunday, the schools will reopen from November 22.Harishchandra Gaikwad, president of the Pune district principals’ association, said that the extended leave will not affect the students’ attendance.“On November 11 and November 12, the students barely attended schools in these two days. In the yearly planning, the Diwali vacation is till November 20. Parents and teachers usually plan an outstation stay during this time and so the extension of holidays on the occasion of Diwali is an apt course of action for schools,” said Gaikwad.Medha Sinnarkar, principal of Laxmanrao Apte Prashala, said that this frequent change of schedule is not good for students as it might affect them.“Many students must have gotten back from their village and would be disappointed if they returned earlier. In these two days, the attendance of school was very poor,” said Sinnarkar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/diwali-vacation-extended-schools-in-pune-to-reopen-from-november-22-101636736505939.html

As only 30 students were randomly selected through a lottery system to participate, others also wanted to join them.“The survey went very smoothly. However, the pupil survey for Class 3 had difficult language for students. The language used were too sophisticated for students of that age. They could have used simple language to make the survey easier for students of Class 3. Except for that, the rest of the survey went fairly well,” said Sharma.Kokil said that NAS 2021 was a new type of survey and the purpose of the survey was to design a new curriculum and teacher training programmes.There were a few schools in rural parts of the district wherein social distancing was not followed.However, Kokil denied any such incident. “There was a maximum of 30 students participating in the survey. And every school has a hall big enough to accommodate 30 students. We did not receive any such complaint from any observers. Schools were also asked to maintain all Covid-19 protocols while the survey was conducted,” said Kokil.Due to the state transport strike, many teachers who were involved in the survey as observers and field instructors were forced to use private vehicles.“Many teachers got together and carpooled if their school was in the same area to streamline the process. This has helped many teachers who had to come back to Pune city to submit the test material,” said Kokil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/national-achievement-survey-gets-good-response-in-pune-district-101636736085024.html
12-11-2021||Lucknow||UP govt, govt-aided schools in a fix over class 9 exams on OMR sheets||Principals of government and government-aided secondary schools affiliated to UP Board are in a fix over the board’s decision to conduct half yearly and annual exams of Class 9 partly on optical mark recognition (also called optical mark reading or OMR) sheets.Reason: In accordance with the government order, they are now needed to get the question papers printed, procure answer-sheets for descriptive questions and OMR sheets all within ₹25 that they are allowed to collect from students as exam fee.In such a situation, the principals have already expressed their inability to conduct the examination partly on the OMR sheets to UP Board. State president, Principals’ Council, Brajesh Sharma said though the principals welcome the new system but for implementing it the state government should also provide a specific budget.“Already, the expenses of all online works are being borne by the institutions and it is not possible to incur extra expenditure of OMR sheets also by them,” he claimed.Under the new National Education Policy (NEP)-2020, the UP Board has made it mandatory to conduct a part of half yearly and annual examination of class 9 on OMR sheets from this academic session. This has been done so that the students can be prepared for future competitive examinations.Under this new system, now the class 9 question paper of 70 marks for the written examination has been divided into two parts: The first part of the question paper will have multiple-choice questions of 20 marks which students will have to answer on the OMR sheet while the second part will have descriptive questions of 50 marks which students will have to answer on conventional answer sheets. In these question papers, questions related to higher-order thinking skills will also be included. UP Board secretary Divyakant Shukla has already sent instructions in this regard to all the district inspectors of schools on November 2.According to the annual calendar released by the UP Board on August 14, the half-yearly examinations are to be held in November and the annual examinations are to be held in February 2022. Though UP Board officials are reluctant to comment on the issue as any decision with regard to a budget for government-aided schools in this regard can be taken by the state government only.A delegation of principals of government-aided institutions did meet UP Board secretary on November 9 in this very regard, shared Murarji Tripathi, principal of Sarvarya Inter College, Bahadurganj, who was part of the delegation“The UP Board secretary informed us that the sample of OMR sheet to be used in class 9 examinations from this session has been uploaded on the board’s official website. He made clear that for this no provision has been made by the government for charging of any additional fee,” Tripathi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-govt-govt-aided-schools-in-a-fix-over-class-9-exams-on-omr-sheets-101636735905024.html

12-11-2021||Mumbai||Fourth cycle of genome sequencing: 75% sample from Covid patients test positive for Delta variant||In the fourth cycle of genome sequencing, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has tested 281 samples from Covid-19 positive patients in Mumbai, of which 75% (210 patients) have tested positive for the Delta variant of Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, and 25% (71) have tested positive for Delta derivative of the virus. Genome sequencing is an exercise to study the changes in the structure of the virus over time. A combination of changes in the ribonucleic acid of the virus can give birth to a new variant.Out of 281 patients, four patients have died and all four of them had not taken any dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. They were all also over 60 years of age. None of the vaccinated patients has died. Results have also revealed only eight out of 281 patients, who took the first dose and only 21 people who took both doses, had to be hospitalised. None of them needed oxygen supply or intensive care.Also, among the 281 patients whose samples were collected for genome sequencing, 26 patients (9%) are in the age group of 0 to 20 years. These include 85 patients (30%) in the age group of 21 to 40 years, 96 patients (34%) in the age group of 41 to 60 years, 66 patients (23%) in the age group of 61 to 80 years and eight patients (3%) in the age group of 81 to 100 years.The Delta variant, also known as B.1.617.2 of Sars-Cov-2, was first detected in India in late 2020. As per the Centre for Disease Control (CDC), the Delta variant causes more infections and spreads faster than earlier forms of the virus that causes Covid-19. The civic body has previously conducted three cycles of genome sequencing. The results of the first lot of samples were declared on August 23, the second on September 21, and the third on October 11. According to information from the BMC’s health department, samples for this fourth cycle were collected over the past two-three weeks. A genome sequencing lab has been set up by BMC at Kasturba Hospital. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray inaugurated the lab on August 4, 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/fourth-cycle-of-genome-sequencing-75-sample-from-covid-patients-test-positive-for-delta-variant-101636734528570.html

12-11-2021||Mumbai||Thief seeks blessings before stealing donation box from temple in Thane||The Naupada police in Thane city have arrested a burglar for allegedly stealing a donation box from a Lord Hanuman temple earlier this week. What left even the police amused, however, was that the thief was seen on CCTV footage touching the Lord’s feet before committing the theft.According to the Naupada police, the incident was reported to them on Thursday by Mahant Mahavirdas Maharaj (57), the priest at the Kabirwadi Hanuman Temple near the Khopat Bus Depot, Thane (W). The complainant, in his statement, said that the theft occurred sometime between 8pm and 9.30pm on Tuesday. The priest had stepped out for some work during that time period and returned to see that the donation box in front of the idol was missing, officials said. The priest informed that the amount in the donation box was ₹1,000.The police then examined the CCTV footage inside the temple and saw a young man entering the temple and touching the idol’s feet before picking up the donation box and fleeing the scene. Footage from outside the temple also showed a second accomplice waiting outside the temple and leaving with the first accused.“We started making inquiries with residents of the area around the temple, working on the assumption that a local would be in the best position to know when there would be the least number of people present in the temple. We showed stills from the CCTV footage to a large number of locals and got several leads as to the identity of the suspects,” senior police inspector Sanjay Dhumal, Naupada police station said.Based on these inquiries, the police started rounding up suspects for questioning and picked up Rabodi resident, Kejas Mhasde (18), on Thursday evening.“Inquiries confirmed his involvement in the theft and he also revealed the identity of his accomplice, who was also picked up from Rabodi,” Dhumal said.The accomplice, identified as Suraj Torane (21), was picked up from his residence and both the accused were placed under arrest late on Thursday night. The police have also recovered the donation box and ₹536 cash from the accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/thief-seeks-blessings-before-stealing-donation-box-from-temple-in-thane-101636734346029.html
12-11-2021||Mumbai||Malavika’s Mumbaistan: Mountainous Achievement||“What a delightful and powerful experience it is to read a good book about India.” -Manu Joseph author of ‘Serious Men’. As an erstwhile voracious reader, who in recent times has seldom found a book that ‘reaches the parts that need reaching’, it is hard to describe the thrill and sheer pleasure that reading Saumya Roy’s recently published ‘Mountain Tales’ has afforded me these past few days. Set in the forgotten vertiginous garbage mountains of Deonar – which are said to stretch over 132 hectares, rising to over 164 feet and receive 5,500 metric tonnes of Mumbai’s waste daily – it follows the true story of a small community of rag pickers who live amongst the vast, teetering piles of rotting food, plastic bottles, medical waste, broken glass and twisted metal and make a living out of it. To write a book about what most would consider a dark, desolate subject and yet manage to infuse it with so much tenderness, heroism and humanity, is where Roy’s mastery as a writer lies. With her journalist’s eye and a poet’s turn of phrase, Roy enchants the reader from the get-go, with her introduction to the book’s 17-year-old “tall athletic and fearless” protagonist Farzana Shaikh, born under the mountains’ shadow, whose life over the next eight years – packed with hair raising danger, undaunted daring and gut-wrenching despair – mirrors that of her family and community. Roy’s deeply humane and empathetic portrayal of Farzana’s family, starting with its patriarch Hyder Ali – an embroiderer’s assistant from Bihar who had come to Mumbai as a young man to find work and had ended up entangled in the mountain’s lure (“he had heard of the mountains that never ran out of work-vast dumping grounds at the edge of the city, where the remnants of everything that Mumbai consumed came to die’) – along with that of the Siddiquis, Shaikhs, Kambles and Khans, evokes the writing of some of her favourite authors such as Gabriel Garcia Marquez, John Steinbeck and Naguib Mahfouz. That she has infused some of the most marginalised people on the planet with a larger-than-life quality, making the reader so deeply engaged with their struggles, hopes and dreams, is just one of the reasons that make Mountain Tales an astonishing accomplishment. *****************************************************************************************************************************The other reason is of course that it’s all true. These men and women who we feel for, despair and empathise with, through her writing are not some fictitious characters conjured up by a skilful author to tell a story, but real, living, breathing people, who actually exist and go about their lives to this day in a suburb of Mumbai, perhaps not too far from our own homes and lives. How had Roy managed to delve so deeply into their lives? How had she won their trust? What did they make of the book? “I got to know them over a period of eight years,” says the Mumbai-based former journalist whose initial introduction to Deonar’s community of rag pickers was as a microfinance lender for the foundation she’d begun with her father in 2010 to provide loans to the city’s marginalised micro-entrepreneurs. “I began visiting as a non-profit lender at first, and then with their consent, spent time in their homes, visited schools, clinics, hospitals, graveyard, markets, shrines with them. Over hundreds of hours, they scribbled in my notebook, fed me, laughed and cried as they told me of their lives lived in the shadow of these mountains. There were things they didn’t want to talk about and I respected that. At other, unexpected times, they began to speak of these and other stories….They wanted to speak about their lives, their so-far unspoken trauma.” But the idea of writing a book about the community crystalized in 2016 when mysterious fires began to consume Deonar’s mountains and threaten the already fragile existence of the community around it. Thinking she’d write a couple of articles on the subject, Roy threw herself even deeper in it, and from here she said the idea for the book grew organically.************************************************************************************************************************Immersing herself in her subject, Roy says she walked the mountains alone and with her subjects, attended hundreds of hours of court proceedings of the ongoing 26-year-old legal battle that was to decide Deonar’s fate and sourced archival material on its history through Right to Information (RTIs) queries, becoming something of an authority on the subject. This intense focus forms the larger narrative of the book and provides a fascinating study of overconsumption, the lack of urban planning and the absence of a political will, which has resulted in mountains of garbage growing often 18-storeys-high in India’s celebrated financial capital. Even more compelling is Roy’s portrayal of the people whose lives are inextricably linked to it, the men and women who live under it and daily scour it for anything they can resell to feed their families. What is remarkable is how in spite of their daily existential struggles to surmount extreme poverty, illnesses and accidents, the book affords readers with moments of unexpected hope, tenderness, joy and love, taking us into a world of birthday parties, teenage romances, joy and sunlight under the mountain’s shadow; depicting mothers who heroically subject their bodies to dangerous clinical trials to feed their children; brothers whose undying love for their sisters prevail over tragedies and tribulations, and steadfast paramours undeterred by the vagaries of fate and physical appearances.************************************************************************************************************************Above all, Roy’s book tells the story of Mumbai and its denizens, those who live lives of conspicuous consumption – acquiring insurmountable piles of objects, only to discard them soon– and the people who live off the dregs of this runaway ingestion. Through the heaps of castaway cell phones, high-heel shoes, make-up, clothes, milk and coffee containers, it tells of the apathy that allows a city to exist cheek by jowl with those whose every meal and day is a challenge. Most importantly, it speaks of the need to acknowledge our shared humanity with those we often disregard or ignore. As Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and author Geeta Anand said about Mountain Tales: “Read it for a most delicious story, read it to understand India, read it to know what it is like to grow up in extreme poverty in the shadow of enormous wealth. If you read one book about India, read this one.” Meanwhile, the Deonar mountains still loom as do the court battles to shut them down, along with the people whose fragile lives depend on it. Mumbai’s invisible twin, its lengthening shadow, the elephant in its room…||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/malavikas-mumbaistan-mountainous-achievement-101636734044746.html
12-11-2021||Ranchi||Top Maoist leader Prashant Bose nabbed in Jharkhand||The Jharkhand police late on Thursday night arrested a senior Maoist leader, Prashant Bose alias Kisan Da (81) after specific inputs from intelligence agencies. But, police officials are tight-lipped about the arrest as of nowThe arrest of Bose, also known as Nirbhay, Kajal, Budha and Maneesh, is possibly a big blow to the Maoist movement, as he is alleged to be the head of the Eastern Regional Bureau (ERB), which includes Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha. Bose hails from the 24 Parganas district of West Bengal. People in the intelligence agency familiar with the development said that Bose, along with his wife Sheela Marandi, was arrested between Jamshedpur and Saraikela when they were on their way to Saranda forest to attend a secret meeting. Bose, who has been underground for over three decades, is one of the senior most Maoist leaders and currently held the charge of central committee member, central military commission and politburo member, while his wife is believed to be a member of the central committee. She is a native of Dhanbad. An intelligence official said that Bose had been arrested for the first time and police were trying to work on leads provided by him during his interrogation. The arrest comes in the backdrop of a series of reverses the Maoists have faced in several states, notwithstanding their capabilities to inflict deadly blows on security forces in Jharkhand, Odisha and Bihar. According to the police, Bose was also the former chief of the Maoist Communist Centre of India and was one of the ideologues, who oversaw the reunification of the revolutionary forces, which led to formation of the CPI (Maoist). Bose had suffered paralysis earlier and he is unable to move anywhere on his own. “His associates were taking him to a safe place but he was nabbed midway,” the official said. The arrest of the duo will have an impact on the morale of the Maoist cadre and the revolutionary activity in north India. However, SSP (Jamshedpur) Dr M Tamil Vanan denied that Bose had been arrested in his jurisdiction. Saraikela SP Anand Prakash said over the phone that in case of Bose‘s arrest, he would be informed immediately. ADG (Operation), Bihar, SM Khopde said in the last five years no cases have been registered against Bose, but he was trying to gather details from concerned districts. He, however, said that he had got news about Bose’s arrest from the media and not from his Jharkhand counterparts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/top-maoist-leader-prashant-bose-nabbed-in-jharkhand-101636733204665.html

12-11-2021||Mumbai||800 families in Khadegolavli area of Kalyan getting muddy water for 10 days||Around 800 families residing in Khadegolavli area of Kalyan have been receiving muddy water for the last 10 days. Despite many complaints, the residents have not received any positive response from the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC).Irked by the poor response, they approached the local water department office and were assured that the pipeline repair work would begin next week and that water tankers would be provided for the residents in the meantime.A senior officer from KDMC said, “We have asked the concerned department to provide water tankers in these areas. It has been identified that there is a blockage in the pipelines leading to those areas. We shall be starting repair work on Tuesday to ensure that the smooth flow of clear water resumes.”Nitin Mishra, a 43-year-old resident of Khadegolavli said, “This area consists of lower middle-class population and has a mix of chawls and small residential buildings with four storeys. All through the Diwali week and later as well, we have been receiving muddy water. Most of us ordered mineral water separately for cooking purposes as it was the festive period. Moreover, our repeated complaints have fallen into deaf ears.”A group of residents, on Friday, approached the water department and took support from the local political leaders to complain about the lackadaisical attitude towards them.“We approached the water department and explained the problems we were facing. It has agreed to start the necessary repair work next week. However, we have been spending from our own pockets for almost two weeks now,” said Bharti Gotekar, a resident of Khadegolavli.“This is not a one-off incident. Since the last six months, there have been several instances when we have received muddy water and the situation has improved after we have made complaints to the civic body. There are multiple high rises that have come up in Kalyan that are getting a proper supply of water. Why are we being ignored despite staying here for decades?” said Mishra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/800-families-in-khadegolavli-area-of-kalyan-getting-muddy-water-for-10-days-101636730444673.html

The minister’s suggestion came at an event to establish a cow study and research chair at Dr Harisingh Gour Central University in Sagar.Parshottam Rupala, Union minister of fisheries, animal husbandry and dairying, travelled to the university 150km from state capital Bhopal for an event to seal a memorandum of understanding for the Kamdhenu Study and Research Centre at the university. This is a first of its kind chair in India that will carry out research on cow and cow products. “The university should establish a big centre for the shelter of cows on the lines of hostel for students. Our ministry and I personally are also ready to cooperate in this. It will promote cow protection in the state,” the minister said, recalling that Prime Minister Narendra Modi started similar hostels in Gujarat when he was the state’s chief minister.The National Cow Commission set up in 2019 has also been promoting the concept for cow hostels.“We know from childhood the importance of cows in many aspects including milk production, manure production and various medicinal uses. Unfortunately, with time we have forgotten the importance of indigenous cows,” he added.The university vice-chancellor Neelima Gupta responded to the minister’s suggestion, saying: “We will also take a decision on opening cow hostels in the university”.MP’s Gopalan and Livestock Promotion Board president Mahamandaleshwar Swami Akhileshwaranand Giri said Madhya Pradesh is the state of most cow lovers and cow servants. He said the world’s largest cowshed can be established in Dr Harisingh Gour University in collaboration with Madhya Pradesh Gau Samvardhan Aayog. MP is the first state to have a cow cabinet formed in 2020 for the conservation and security of cows in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/set-up-cow-hostel-minister-tells-mp-university-that-starts-cow-research-centre-101636730024544.html
12-11-2021||Delhi||Stay at home: Delhi-NCR air quality on brink of ‘emergency’||Authorities on Friday advised people to limit outdoor activities and told government and private offices to cut vehicle use by at least 30 per cent as air quality in Delhi-NCR inched towards the emergency level amid a rise in emissions from farm fires and unfavourable meteorological conditions.Over 4,000 farm fires, accounting for 35 per cent of Delhi's pollution on Friday, played a major role in pushing the 24-hour average Air Quality Index (AQI) to 471 by 4 pm, the worst this season so far. It was 411 on Thursday.A sub-committee on Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) said meteorological conditions will be highly unfavourable for dispersion of pollutants till November 18 and agencies concerned must be fully ready to implement measures under 'emergency' category.The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) said the 24-hour average concentration of lung-damaging fine particles known as PM2.5 in Delhi-NCR crossed the 300 mark around midnight and stood at 381 micrograms per cubic metre at 4 pm on Friday, over six times the safe limit of 60 micrograms per cubic metre.The PM10 level was recorded at 577 micrograms per cubic metre, over five times the safe limit of 100 micrograms per cubic metre.According to GRAP, the air quality is considered to be in the 'emergency' category if the PM2.5 and PM10 levels continue to be above 300 micrograms per cubic metre and 500 micrograms per cubic metre respectively for 48 hours or more.After reviewing the situation, the sub-committee on GRAP said, "Government and private offices and other establishments are advised to reduce vehicle usage by at least 30 per cent (by working from home, carpooling, optimising field activities etc). People are advised to limit outdoor activities and minimise their exposure.” "Concerned agencies must be in complete readiness for implementation of measures under 'emergency' category as per GRAP (Graded Response Action Plan)," an order issued by the committee read.The GRAP -- a set of anti-pollution measures followed in Delhi and its vicinity according to the severity of the situation – comes into force in mid-October when air quality levels start worsening.The measures to be followed in the 'emergency' situation include stopping the entry of trucks in Delhi, ban on construction activities and introducing the odd-even car rationing scheme.CPCB Member Secretary Prashant Gargava observed that in view of unfavourable meteorology, stubble burning and poor dispersion resulting in accumulation of pollutants, the coming week is critical regarding Delhi-NCR's air quality.The CPCB said an action-taken report is received daily from Uttar Pradesh and Haryana Pollution Control Boards but these are awaited from Delhi Pollution Control Committee and Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board.According to an analysis by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee, people in Delhi breathe the worst air between November 1 and November 15 every year. The city has recorded severe air quality on six of the last eight days after Diwali.Faridabad (460), Ghaziabad (486), Greater Noida (478), Gurgaon (448) and Noida (488) also recorded severe air quality at 4 pm on Friday.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered "good", 51 and 100 "satisfactory", 101 and 200 "moderate", 201 and 300 "poor", 301 and 400 "very poor", and 401 and 500 "severe".A layer of eye-stinging smog lingering over Delhi-NCR thickened on Friday, giving an orange tint to the sun and lowering visibility to 200 metres at several places in the region.India Meteorological Department officials said moderate fog and low temperatures in the morning -- a low of 12.6 degrees Celsius on Friday -- and calm winds have been trapping pollutants close to the ground."Visibility levels at the Indira Gandhi International Airport and the Safdarjung Airport dropped to 200-500 metres due to moderate fog. It intensified on Friday due to high humidity," an official said.Green think tank Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) has said the ongoing smog episode is a public health emergency and could be the longest in four years. In another report, it said vehicles accounted for more than 50 per cent of Delhi's pollution from October 24 to November 8.According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality forecasting agency SAFAR, stubble burning has accounted for at least 25 per cent of Delhi's PM2.5 pollution for nine days on the trot, starting November 4.Gufran Beig, the founder project director of SAFAR, said stubble burning generally contributes to PM2.5 but this time its coarser particles in PM10 are also becoming a lead pollutant at several locations in Delhi."This is a new feature in the winter. This is mainly because of the particle growth mechanism due to high humidity at night and increased humidity during the day probably due to water sprinkling which increases the holding capacity of the air. Since the flow is regular, many PM2.5 particles are growing towards PM10 (sic)," he said.The share of farm fire in Delhi's pollution had increased to 48 per cent on Sunday, the highest since November 5, 2018, when it was 58 per cent.Last year, the share of stubble burning in Delhi's pollution had peaked at 42 per cent on November 5. In 2019, it accounted for 44 per cent of Delhi's PM2.5 pollution on November 1.Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai on Friday launched the second leg of the campaign to control dust pollution. On Thursday, he had launched a month-long campaign to prevent the open burning of waste and biomass in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/stay-at-home-delhi-ncr-air-quality-on-brink-of-emergency-101636726881756.html
12-11-2021||Other||{Maharaja Ranjit Singh birth anniv today} 24 years after announcement, birthplace Sangrur village awaits Maharaja’s statue||Sangrur Residents of Badrukhan village, believed to be the birthplace of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, in the district have been waiting for the installation of the statue of Maharaja Ranjit Singh for the past 24 years, when the then Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal promised to pay tribute to him in this form. The project has hung fire since. Born on November 13, 1780, Sikh historians say that the Maharaja was born in Badrukhan. This was also the native village of his mother Raj Kaur, and the culture of that time was that the first child was to be delivered at the mother’s native place. Some historians, however, contend that he was born in Gujranwala in Pakistan.In June this year, Punjab public works department (PWD) minister and Sangrur MLA Vijay Inder Singla said the state government had sanctioned ₹99.1 lakh for the development of a park and the installation of a new statue of the Maharaja. The work on the park is in progress, but the statue has not been installed so far.Randeep Singh Mintu, son of a former sarpanch, said, “The SAD-BJP and the Congress, both, ruled for over 10 years after the announcement, but no one worked to install the statue of the Maharaja. The fort where the Maharaja was born in the village should be declared a museum and the state government should take responsibility for its care and maintenance.”Sunam Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA Aman Arora said, “I have raised the issue twice in the state assembly. The SAD, which claimed to provide a regime like that of Maharaja Ranjit Singh failed honour him by the installation of a statue.”The SAD government had observed the birth anniversary of the Maharaja at state-level functions in 1997, 2001 and 2007. The Congress governments have held no such event.“Work on the park and the statue near the Chandigarh-Bathinda national highway in the village is on and will be completed within 20-22 days,” Singla said. Sangrur deputy commissioner Ramvir said the Maharaja will be remembered on his birthday in Badrukhan on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maharaja-ranjit-singh-birth-anniv-today-24-years-after-announcement-birthplace-sangrur-village-awaits-maharaja-s-statue-101636728704325.html
12-11-2021||Mumbai||Ulhasnagar civic body plans to acquire fire fighting bike to enter narrow lanes and avert disaster||The Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation (UMC) plans to introduce a fire-fighting bike with a capacity of 40 litres of water. This will enable UMC to enter smaller lanes in the city to douse fire and avert a major mishap.Leelabai Ashan, UMC mayor, said, “We have suggested to the civic body to make arrangements and plan to purchase a fire-fighting bike that will have access to all parts of the city. The fire brigade officers have also started enquiring about the benefits and usage of these bikes.” According to an officer from the fire rescue team, “The market price for the vehicle is around ₹15 lakh and hence we have planned to go for an assembled piece that will come to around ₹8 or ₹10 lakh. Such a provision will only help provide additional support to the fire brigade team from Ulhasnagar,” said a senior fire officer from UMC.The fire-fighting bike will comprise a water tank with a capacity of 40 litres and a fire bomb that helps douse fire within seconds. Such provisions will help control the fire in case of an emergency and if the fire brigade is unable to reach the disaster spot due to the crammed lanes.Ulhasnagar is a mix of residential areas, small-scale business units and factories along with shops and commercial establishments. As all these function simultaneously amidst narrow lanes that have illegal parking and often cause traffic jams, it makes it difficult for the fire brigade to reach on time during an emergency. A fire-fighting bike can access such locations and reduce the impact of the fire until the fire brigade finds its way.UMC is still working out the budget and will soon make provision to purchase a fire-fighting bike.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ulhasnagar-civic-body-plans-to-acquire-fire-fighting-bike-to-enter-narrow-lanes-and-avert-disaster-101636727864822.html

Around 12,090 people were fined for not wearing helmets during this period. These also included pillion riders without helmets.“The intention was to spread awareness among the two-wheeler riders and pillion riders on the importance of wearing helmets. It is compulsory for the pillion riders too to wear a helmet. During an accident, there is no guarantee as to who will fall and who will have what per cent of injury. Hence, it is always better to be safe than sorry and follow all the traffic rules,” DCP (traffic), Purushottam Karad, said.Of the 12 days, the highest number of cases was reported on October 30 with 2,100 cases and the least number was reported on November 4 with 395 cases.“When it comes to accidents, four-wheelers top the number of accidents followed by two-wheelers. But when it comes to deaths caused due to accidents, bikes top the list followed by four-wheelers. This year, a total of 580 accidents have been reported till October,” Karad added.The traffic department plans to continue with the drive along with signal jumping, triple seat ride on two-wheelers, driving without seat belt and talking on phone while driving. The department also plans to take actions like cancelling the license in case of repeated offences instead of simply levying a fine. The fine for not wearing a helmet is ₹200, which was levied in cash as well as e-challan.“Apart from the highways, internal roads also had the drive as most of the times people tend to take it lightly while riding on internal roads,” police inspector Bapurao Deshmukh from Vashi traffic unit said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/navi-mumbai-traffic-cops-fine-12-090-for-riding-without-helmets-101636727509320.html

12-11-2021||Mumbai||Malawi mangoes enter Navi Mumbai’s APMC market from Africa||Malawi mangoes, known to be replicas to Devgad Alphonso, entered the APMC market on Friday. Ever since the Malawi mangoes started getting imported from Africa, for the first time, the rates have reached as high as ₹1,200 to ₹1,500 per kg.“A total of 270 boxes arrived on Friday and over the period of a month, around 40 tons of mangoes are expected to reach us. The increase in petrol charges, air freight, import duty and other taxes have led to the increase in the price,” Sanjay Pansare, director of fruit market in APMC, said.Besides, the increasing demand in the UK, the Gulf and Malaysia has also led to increase in price, Pansare added.Each box consisting of 3kg mangoes were sold from ₹3,600 to ₹4,500 per box. “Within hours, all the boxes were sold and the buyers were retailers from Colaba, Cuffe Parade and Crawford. From next week, the shipment is expected to be twice a week. As the supply will increase, it will be sold to Ahmednagar, Surat, Balgaum and other places too, wherever Devgad mangoes are in demand,” he added.Around 11 years back, a few Alphonso mango sticks were sent to Malawi in Africa from Ratnagiri. They were grafted and planted across a 26-acre farm, which is now a 600ha farm. These mangoes started being imported to India in 2018. In 2018, 40 tons of mangoes had reached APMC, which then cost ₹1,500 per 3kg box. In 2019, around 70 tons of mangoes reached and in 2020, due to Covid, only 15 tons could be imported at ₹2,500- ₹3,000 per box.The Indian mangoes are not available in October-December, when mangoes are harvested in Malawi. Hence, there is no clash between both the seasons. Indian Aphonsos arrive from January through August from various parts of South and Konkan belt of Maharashtra. This year, Malawis are expected to be in the market till December 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/malawi-mangoes-enter-navi-mumbai-s-apmc-market-from-africa-101636725884624.html

12-11-2021||Dehradun||2 Kashmiri students in Dehradun questioned after tip-off, released: Police||DEHRADUN: Two students from Jammu and Kashmir studying in Uttarakhand capital Dehradun were questioned by the police for hours before being released, a police officer said on Friday. The officer said the decision to question the students at the city’s Premnagar police station was taken after input was received from the J&K police about their possible links to a terror suspect.“Acting on the input from the J&K police, we called the two to the police station for questioning which went for several hours. However, they were later released after police didn’t find anything suspicious from them related to the input,” the officer said. Uttarakhand director general of police Ashok Kumar, however, insisted that the decision to question the two students was part of an ongoing verification exercise.“The students were asked to report to the police station as part of the routine verification process of students and people from other states staying in Uttarakhand,” said Kumar.Nasir Khuehami, national spokesperson of J&K Students Association, said they reached out to authorities back home after the two students were picked up by the police. It appears they did send an input that the two students used to “hang out with a person linked to militancy in Kashmir in their area.” “Upon speaking to the police authorities in Kashmir it was found that they had come to know that the two, hailing from Kupwara district of Kashmir, were seen with some suspected elements in their area. They sent the input to Uttarakhand on the same asking them to find out more on it after which both were summoned by the police for questioning in the matter,” said Khuehami. He added, “Both were released on Friday after 16 hours.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/2-kashmiri-students-in-dehradun-questioned-after-tip-off-released-police-101636724384177.html

12-11-2021||Dehradun||‘Wise men should…’: Harish Rawat’s advice to Salman Khurshid on book row||HALDWANI: Senior Congress leader Harish Rawat on Friday waded into the row over Salman Khurshid’s controversial statement in his book, saying his party colleague should correct his statement in the book that has touched off a political firestorm and should avoid any comparisons that “strengthen venom-spewing forces in society”.“Politicians, or for that matter, wise men should avoid making such statements,” Rawat, a former Uttarakhand chief minister, said in Haldwani in response to questions on Khurshid’s remark in his book “Sunrise over Ayodhya: Nationhood in Our Times”.At one point in the book, Khurshid referred to Sanatan Dharma and classical Hinduism known to sages and saints “being pushed aside by robust version of Hindutva, by all standards a political version similar to the jihadist Islam of groups like ISIS and Boko Haram of recent years.”The Congress has already distanced itself from Khurshid’s comment. Rawat reiterated that this could be Salman Khurshid’s personal view, “but the Congress and we all don’t agree with it.” Senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad has already stressed that comparing Hindutva to Jihadist Islam was an exaggeration.In a tweet earlier, Azad said the Congress may not agree with Hindutva as a political ideology distinct from the composite culture of Hinduism, “but comparing Hindutva with ISIS and Jihadist Islam is factually wrong and an exaggeration.”The BJP has been unsparing in its criticism. On Friday, the Madhya Pradesh government said it is exploring the option of banning Khurshid’s book in the state.MP home minister Narottam Mishra saw the comment as a reflection of the approach of top Congress leaders who leave no opportunity “to attack our faith”.To be sure, Khurshid has underlined that the statement was being misinterpreted. “I have not called these guys terrorists, I have just said they are similar in distorting religion. What Hindutva has done, it has pushed aside Sanatan Dharma and Hinduism and it has taken over a robust, aggressive position similar to Boko Haram and those other guys,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/wise-men-should-harish-rawat-s-advice-to-salman-khurshid-on-book-row-101636719343915.html
12-11-2021||Mumbai||Fire in Navi Mumbai’s Panje wetlands to chase away migratory birds, allege environmentalists||Following a fire at Panje wetlands on Thursday, environmentalists have alleged that the fire to the dry grass was man made apparently to chase away the migratory birds to suit the vested interests of those trying to convert the biodiversity into a concrete jungle.NatConnect Foundation and Shri Ekvira Aai Pratishtan lodged a fresh complaint with CM Uddhav Thackeray and have also drawn the attention of the High Court-appointed Mangrove Protection and Conservation Committee to the fire incident.“These nonstop attempts to sabotage the wetlands are alarming,” said Nandakumar Pawar, head of Shri Ekvira Aai Pratishtan.The wetlands continue to be starved of tidal water flow as the water inlets to the 289ha area continue to be blocked. This, despite the Raigad Collector stating in his affidavit to the National Green Tribunal that the choke points at Panje wetlands have been removed.Earlier, two miscreants had set crackers on fire, making the birds fly helter-skelter. As many as 50 species of birds visit the wetlands during the migratory season from October to May, and they move to other suitable areas during the monsoon.Raigad district collector, Dr Mahendra Kalyankar, messaged NatConnect quoting his team that what was stated in the affidavit to National Greens Tribunal was correct. Kumar said he presented the GPS photographs, which the collector asked his team to crosscheck.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/fire-in-navi-mumbai-s-panje-wetlands-to-chase-away-migratory-birds-allege-environmentalists-101636718455155.html
12-11-2021||Mumbai||Anil Deshmukh sent to ED custody till November 15 in PMLA case||A Special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) Court on Friday sent former Maharashtra home minister and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Anil Deshmukh to Enforcement Directorate (ED) custody till November 15. Additional Sessions Judge HS Satbhai on Friday sent Deshmukh to ED custody.The former home minister was arrested after more than 12 hours of grilling by the agency on November 2 in which the officials said he was evasive while answering them so they could arrest him and demand his custody.Appearing for the agency on Friday, in the third remand application counsel Shriram Shirsath told the court, “That the agency had requested the court for recording the statement of dismissed police inspector Sachin Vaze who is one of the accused in the case. However, its application was rejected by the court as Vaze was presently in the Mumbai Crime branch’s custody till November 13 in an extortion case. However, as Vaze’s custody was ending on November 13 they can record Vaze’s statement after which it will require Deshmukh’s custody to confront with facts/evidence which may occur after recording a fresh statement of Vaze.”The court was told that Vaze collected money from several bar owner’s on Deshmukh’s behest which was allegedly laundered.Shirsath also told the court that in their investigations it further emerged that Deshmukh was involved in the transfer and postings of police officials in Maharashtra and Mumbai and so further statement of Deshmukh is yet to be recorded to unearth the truth.The agency told the court that a private person from Deshmukh’s constituency has been summoned by the agency on November 13 and he was handling certain prestigious projects. The agency after recording the statement of the said person will require Deshmukh’s custody to confront him with the facts that emerge from that as well thereafter.The ED, in its remand application asking for three more days of custody, told the court that Deshmukh has played a very crucial role in the offence of money laundering. He has not provided the required information regarding the laundering of proceeds of crime. The agency told the court that certain key persons have been called for questioning to confront with facts aroused during the recording of statements of Deshmukh and his custody will be required to confront with facts that may arise after ED’s questioning them.Deshmukh, who appeared before the court in a white kurta and pants, told the court that he was in ED custody for the last ten days. “I have been questioned every day for more than eight to ten hours and have answered more than 200 questions put by the agency to me.”Deshmukh even submitted an application before the agency, retracting all his statements given to the agency.Senior counsel Vikram Chaudhri, who argued for Deshmukh along with Aniket Nikam, told the court that this was the third remand application of Deshmukh.“He was questioned for the full day on 1st of November and arrested late night on 2nd of November. A holiday court had given ED custody of Deshmukh till the 6th of November, later, the holiday Sessions court sent Deshmukh to judicial custody. However, the agency appeared before the Bombay High Court and after the consent of both parties, Deshmukh was sent to ED custody till November 12. Now, their application for further custody is not maintainable as with consent and after seeking instructions they had made a statement and demanded the custody before the highest court in the state.”Chaudhri further told the court that Deshmukh had appeared before the agency voluntarily to prove his bonafide without applying for any anticipatory bail application and his petition was pending before the apex court. The agency had told specifically before the Bombay High court that Deshmukh was just a suspect and not an accused and they only needed some explanation from him.The agency has not arrested accused number one Sachin Vaze, though it says he played a key role in the offence. “Only two people arrested in these offences are my personal assistant’s Kundan Shinde and Sanjeev Palande,” he said.“The person who made the allegations, former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh, Where is he?” Chaudhri questioned.He said the applicant who went to their office and was co-operating with the investigations was arrested by the agency.“The country is passing through a phase where there is complete anarchy and chaos. The only saviour is the judiciary. Behind any dark order, there is a sacred order.”Chaudhri asked the court why can’t the agency record statement or confront Deshmukh during judicial custody.After hearing both sides, the court sent Deshmukh to ED custody for three days.Earlier, NCP leader and daughter of NCP Supremo Sharad Pawar, Supriya Sule, came to the Session’s Court and had a detailed discussion with the counsels of Deshmukh. Sule left the court premises after greeting Deshmukh.Meanwhile, the anticipatory bail application (ABA) of Hrishikesh Deshmukh, the younger son of Anil Deshmukh, was adjourned by the court to November 20.In its earlier remand application, the ED alleged, “Deshmukh has emerged an important cog in the wheels.” Deshmukh has emerged as the main beneficiary, he is required to be interrogated in custody. In its application seeking Deshmukh’s remand, the agency said a foreign angle cannot be ruled out.The ED alleged that on Deshmukh’s instructions, Vaze had called a meeting of bar owners from Mumbai and demanded a monthly amount of ₹3 lakh from each of them.In its charge sheet, the agency said that Vaze had collected ₹4.70 crore from various bar owners between December 2020 and February 2021 at Deshmukh’s behest. According to the agency, Vaze handed over the extorted money to Shinde and subsequently, a part of the amount was routed to the charitable trust in Nagpur through various shell companies.The agency claimed that its investigation began after former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh alleged that Deshmukh had directed Vaze to collect ₹100 crore every month from establishments in Mumbai. Singh approached the Bombay high court (HC) and filed a petition in the matter. Based on HC’s order, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) initially conducted a preliminary enquiry and on April 21 registered an offence under provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act, after which ED started its investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/anil-deshmukh-sent-to-ed-custody-till-november-15-in-pmla-case-101636717785451.html

12-11-2021||Mumbai||Flamingo boat rides by Coastal and Marine Biodiversity in Airoli resumes to overwhelming response||The flamingo boat rides conducted by the Coastal and Marine Biodiversity Centre (CMBC) in Airoli have received overwhelming responses ever since it was restarted on October 15 after the second lockdown.According to the officials, more than 750 birdwatchers from across Mumbai, Thane and Navi Mumbai enjoyed the boat rides in the first 25 days. Last year, the rides were restarted on November 1 (after the first lockdown) and the number of visitors in the first month was less than 600.NG Kokare, range forest officer from the centre, said, “We have two types of boats here. The big boats can accommodate 24 birdwatchers and they move at a normal speed. Apart from the driver, such boats have a guide to give information to people on board. The smaller boats, which can accommodate only seven people, are speed boats. Normally the members of a family or a group of friends opt for such boats, and there the driver himself plays the role of a guide.”Depending on the existence of flamingos, the boats go either towards Vikhroli or Vashi, and return to the centre. A ride is completed in an hour.“Usually flamingos come to the creek in October and stay here until the onset of monsoon in June. Visitors can see the birds from close quarters during the rides. We decide the timing of the rides depending on the high tide and low tide of the day. In our centre, we are strictly following the Covid-19 protocols,” Kokare said.CMBC also has a separate information centre and their team explains different aspects of mangroves, birds, crabs among others by showing pictures there. “Entry to that centre is free for people who come for boat rides. But we take a nominal fee from the other people,” another official said. The official said, “Earlier we also had the online booking system. However, the tours and travel agencies would book all the boats beforehand and that would deprive the other people. Also, those agencies would charge their customers anything between ₹1,000 and ₹1,500 for a ride whereas we take only ₹396 from one birdwatcher on a 24-seater boat on weekdays.” Shwetha Shinde, 41, a resident of Ghansoli who took a boat ride, said, “Even as I was born and brought up in Navi Mumbai, I had never seen flamingos so closely until I took the ride. That day we were taken towards the Vashi bridge and it was a unique experience. We could see both Mumbai and Navi Mumbai on either side of the creek. Every nature-lover should enjoy the boat ride at least once.” The birdwatchers can book their boat rides on the CMBC helpline 99876 73737.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/flamingo-boat-rides-by-coastal-and-marine-biodiversity-in-airoli-resumes-to-overwhelming-response-101636714843376.html

12-11-2021||Pune||Global Village Idiot: Self publishing is the write reality check||Can I make money writing books? What does it take to publish a book? Is self-publishing better than going through a publisher?Questions that I used to ask myself many years ago. Questions that many individuals have asked me this past year - as many as a dozen in the past quarter itself.So let me begin with a definitive piece of data my father provided helpfully - several times - in my initial years as a struggling writer. “Most writers live in poverty. Those who don’t, have a job; and many eventually die hungry. If you think you have something to say that others may pay to read, have the courage to back your own book - print it yourself instead of chasing publishers for years and then printing it on your own under their name.”I thought he was very discouraging but I always respected his advice. So, I got a job. In fact, I got several. But I also ‘felt’ that I was special, born to write. I guess every writer thinks their book is great. I sure did. Secretly, I was waiting to be discovered, to have the appreciation of my friends and family turn into the adulation of millions.But I am a restless sort of person, blessed with very little (probably no) patience. So, eventually, I stopped waiting to be discovered and sent out manuscripts to different publishers. My decision making was always based on evidence, and 14 rejections were not just a sign but hard evidence, so I learned from the rejections ... and decided to publish my own book. By that time (20 years after my first rejection), self-publishing had become easy. Really. Easy.You have several options for self-publishing. There are tonnes of companies and startups who will ‘self-publish’ you. Tonnes. Well, at least 40 companies last I checked. Here’s my take now: self-publishing means do-it-yourself. So do it yourself. It won’t cost you anything more than time, effort, and printing-related expenses.There are of course helpful platforms that have been established by very kind people to help you publish stuff yourself very quickly, very easily. You just have to upload your manuscript and click and click, say yes or no to minor details they ask for (fine print may or may not tell you that they will reformat or realign to fit their software) and voila! Your book will be published! You are an author! That’s how I published my first eBook on Apple iBooks and Amazon’s KDP (Kindle Direct Publishing). iBooks was the smoother quality experience since it was integrated with word-processing and production software. KDP has a super-secret process with little control to the author over formatting.Okay so the book did not look or feel as you originally imagined it and if you Google or Bing yourself you may not find yourself and your creation as easily as you thought you would, but that requires some more work. So, I waited and waited and after a few copies were sold, I read the fine print on the various platforms and learned the third big secret about the book business: Writing a Book, Publishing a Book, and Selling a Book are three completely different industries in today’s age. And: most books don’t really sell. Apparently, the average non-fiction book (print) sells 200-300 copies in the first year and maybe around 1,000 copies in its lifetime across years. There are differing numbers for this metric and none reliable for eBook sales since they are not easily tracked or verified. If you think hard about it, a bulk of that first-year sale really comes from an author’s network. So, if you are going to self-publish, do the math first.For the next book, I hired a designer and then an illustrator and then replaced them and … eventually did everything on my own including the cover design. Lesson: In the book business you don’t need a graphic designer, you need someone who understands print and digital publishing.By the time of the third book, I had two very fast learning team members who actually had experience with my subject matter and photo-editing and they picked up the software skills quickly and it turned out to be the best book … till it went to the press (since I wanted hard copy). Long story short, it took four books, considerable effort, time to train and some investment to get the printing and publishing right. Because the second big unwritten secret of publishing books in the digital age is that all the ‘quick and easy and in minutes’ is meant for text-driven books. If you have images or illustrations or even require a set of specific fonts or style of editing, it’s a different timeline and cost. Becoming a publisher is not too difficult if you want it badly enough. You just have to register for ISBN (International Standard Book Number) - that’s where your formal copyright comes from - and it doesn’t take too long: a week or so at most. Printing is on-demand, any small or medium-sized press will print and bind the books for you and it’s best for you to collaborate with them and supervise especially if colour is involved. You can print a copy at a time and price your book accordingly or you can print in bulk if you are optimistic about sales (bulk printing reduces your cost per copy, giving you a better margin per copy sold but your house fills up with unsold copies).It was on the fifth book that I learned the Number 1, the big, the ultimate secret of publishing: You can write as much as you want - and let’s assume it’s pure gold - it has to sell for you to make money.According to an industry estimate, there were 1.7 million self-published books in the US alone in 2018. So, add the millions for the global market and yours would be one of the several million (and counting) out there waiting to be noticed by readers.The biggest benefit of self-publishing is that you can publish on any subject and in any format. The opinion of editors and publishers doesn’t matter since it’s your money that you are spending. Most of the digital publishing companies are mostly tech platforms which means they need you and your network on their platform so that their user numbers (and therefore valuation) increase. They are not magicians, and they are unlikely to guarantee sales. My tip is to get your book on as many platforms as you can because you never know where you could get a sale from. And to invest in promotion and marketing.To succeed as an author, you’ll have to know the way the market works and make difficult informed choices at every step, because: like all good things in life, self-publishing is a great way to build character.Sanjay Mukherjee, author, learning-tech designer and management consultant, is founder of Mountain Walker and chief strategy advisor, Peak Pacific.

12-11-2021||Bangalore||Plug in your earphones please: Karnataka high court bans loud music on public buses||The Karnataka High Court has decided to impose a ban on playing loud music or videos on mobile phones while travelling in state buses. The court order was issued while hearing a writ petition seeking restrictions on “noise disturbance inside buses”.The high court said that if any passenger travelling on a Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) bus refuses to comply with the order, the driver or the bus conductor “can deboard” him or her. The bus may also be halted until they are offloaded, the order read.The rule will be implemented immediately, said KSRTC’s public relations officer Latha TS. “Playing loud music in buses by passengers disturbs other passengers as well as the driver and conductor. Hence, as per the order from the transport department, we are implementing the rule immediately and all drivers and conductors have been made aware of the new rule,” the officer was quoted as saying by the Indian Express.The person asked to deboard can also not claim a refund on the bus fare. The existing Rule 94 of the Karnataka Motor Vehicles Rules (1989) also bars passengers travelling on such vehicles (“stage carriage”) should refrain from “singing or playing any musical instrument or operating a transistor radio”.The Karnataka high court further stated that officials on the bus should first request passengers to not play songs or videos on loud music. The KSRTC said it would create awareness about noise pollution and make announcements about the new rule at bus stations and terminals, as well as their social media handles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/plug-in-your-earphones-please-karnataka-high-court-bans-loud-music-on-public-buses-101636711092288.html

12-11-2021||Mumbai||Former BJP minister grabbed land donated for a temple: Nawab Malik||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and state minister Nawab Malik on Friday alleged that a minister in the previous BJP-led state government in Maharashtra grabbed acres of land that had been donated to a temple. He said that he would disclose the name and other details in the coming days. On Thursday, Malik said that NCP is planning to soon meet Enforcement Directorate (ED) officials in Mumbai demanding to expedite the pending inquiries against some of the political leaders who are in BJP now. Though Malik did not name any of the leaders, he said one of them is a union minister and another a former state minister, indicating at Narayan Rane and Kripashankar Singh. Cases were lodged against them when they were in the Congress a few years ago. Talking about the raids on Wakf related properties by the ED, Malik said on Friday that the ED should support the clean-up drive undertaken by his department for the Waqf properties. “I want to expose all those people who have grabbed lands donated for religious institutions such as masjid, dargah and temples. I want all these people behind bars,” he told reporters. On Thursday, ED conducted raids at seven places in Pune and one place in Aurangabad in connection with the Pune Waqf Board land scam case after an Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) was registered by ED. The FIR stated that the trust, which is registered with the Waqf Board, owns eight hectares in Maan village of Mulshi taluka. The government was scheduled to give compensation of ₹9.64 crore to the trust and accordingly released ₹7.7 crore. The trust later complained to the Waqf – the Muslim charity board – that it had not received any compensation from the state. During an inquiry by the deputy collector (land acquisition), it was revealed that Shaikh and Mulani had submitted fake documents to claim the money. Following a complaint, Shaikh and Mulani were arrested. Meanwhile, BJP leader Haji Arfat Shaikh alleged that Nawab Malik illegally elevated peons in the minority affairs department as officers and leased out Waqf properties illegally. Arfat said that the decision was taken without having a majority in the Waqf Board for such decisions. He also alleged that the minister did the appointments of the officers in the Waqf Board without consulting the chief minister or the state cabinet. Refuting the allegations, Fadnavis accused Malik of buying property from persons linked with the underworld, and an accused in the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/nawab-malik-alleges-former-bjp-minister-grabbed-land-donated-for-a-temple-101636709264255.html

It has equated Hindutva with terrorist groups such as Islamic State, which overran parts of Syria and Iraq before it was routed.The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) espouses Hindutva, or Hinduness, as its ideology that defines Indian culture as per the values of India’s dominant faith - Hinduism.Also Read: ‘Exaggeration’: Ghulam Nabi Azad on comparing Hindutva with jihadist IslamMishra alleged Congress leaders leave no opportunity to “break Hindutva” and to divide Hindus into caste. He accused Rahul Gandhi of patronising this division. “That is the same idea that Salman Khurshid is carrying forward,” he said. “They leave no opportunity to attack our faith and to divide India into castes. About Hindutva, the Supreme Court has said that it is a way of life but they did not leave Hindutva too. Now, Congress president Sonia Gandhi should clarify with whom she stands.”Opposition Congress leader Ajay Yadav said it was the BJP leaders, who were defaming Hindutva. “This statement of the home minister is nothing but a political gimmick as people can buy the book online. But by making such statement, the state government is attacking freedom of speech.”RN Singh, a legal expert in Jabalpur, said, “The state government can ban a book or publication under Section 95 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). The section says the government has the power to ban a book that contains objectionable matter that is intended to promote feelings of enmity and hatred among different communities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/seeking-legal-opinion-to-ban-salman-khurshid-s-book-madhya-pradesh-minister-101636708783271.html

The elephants came in from neighbouring Bankura district, becoming the largest herd in recent times to have damaged crops in East Bardhaman (also called East Burdwan). There were no reports on casualties or injuries. “A huge herd, comprising 40-50 elephants, wreaked havoc in a dozen villages in East Bardhaman since Thursday. This is the largest herd we have ever seen. Earlier, elephants used to enter the district in herds of around 10. They inflicted heavy damage to crops as it is the paddy harvest season,” said Abhedananda Thander, a legislator from Ausgram in East Bardhaman. After the herd entered the district, villagers tried to scare them away using elephant chasers and firecrackers. It resulted in the herd splitting into two smaller ones, both of which later went on separate paths, damaging crops.Also Read: Chhattisgarh SP, wife hurt as they try to escape elephant that charged at themSenior forest officials rushed to the spot to figure out how the tuskers could be given a safe passage back to the forested district of Bankura.“More than 150 forest officials from three forest divisions and at least four ‘hula parties (elephant chasers)’ have been deployed. On Thursday night, we tried to drive the elephants back to Bankura, but some villagers put up fire barricades along that route to protect their crops from damage. So, the elephants went in different directions. We are now trying to unite them and push them back to Bankura. We can’t allow the elephants to stay in East Bardhaman as there are no forests here,” said Debal Roy, West Bengal’s chief wildlife warden. Conservation efforts in recent times have resulted in West Bengal’s elephant population shooting up to 700 from around 175 in 1989.

12-11-2021||Bhopal||Two radio-collared tigers found dead in Madhya Pradesh’s Panna Tiger Reserve||Two of the three tigers who were radio-collared in Madhya Pradesh’s Panna Tiger Reserve and helped understand an unknown aspect of feline behaviour - the brotherhood of inseparable cubs Heera and Panna in July - died this month, officials said on Friday.“One-year-old Heera was killed by villagers in Satna [on November 1] and he was fitted with a radio collar in January this year,” said an official, who did not wish to be named. Another three-year-old tigress was found dead in the reserve’s Rampur buffer zone on Wednesday. The two were part of a study being conducted in collaboration with Dehradun’s Wildlife Institute of India (WII).The state forest department and WII planned to fit radio collars to study the behaviour of 14 tigers living outside the reserve’s core zone of about 15,000 sq km--the Panna landscape. The collars were first fitted on the three tigers.Also Read: Bear found dead in MP’s Panna Tiger Reserve“In the study, aspects such as sharing food and water and spending time with each other came out. The real study of the journey started in July when the tiger moved to the landscape in search of his territory. But before it could reveal more details, his skinned carcass was found at hillock of Satna,” said the official.The official said the study related to the movement of the tiger, the distance the animal covers in a day, how it searches the prey, finds out whether it is a safer place or not, the reason for staying at a particular place for some days and for moving ahead. “All this has gone in vain with the death of the tigers.”The three-year-old tigress was fitted with a radio collar in February as she was moving in the buffer zone already home to two tigresses. “The tigress did not move much in the past 10 months,” the official said.“Losing two tigers is painful and their death has interrupted our study going on for the past 10-11 months to know about how tigers move and the selection of their territories. The study would have provided us insight into their behaviour in areas having the human presence.”Forest officials said the tigress died of some internal injuries. “Prima facie, the cause of death appears to be natural due to an injury near her neck. All the body parts were found intact and there were no injury marks suggesting a territorial fight,” said UK Sharma, field director, Panna Tiger Reserve.Principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife) Alok Kumar said the deaths have affected the study. “But now, the collars will be fitted on other tigers,”Sharma said the Centre and WII choose the reserve for the study after the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) included it in the Man and Biosphere programme.The reserve has undergone substantial ecosystem restoration in the buffer zone. The Unesco included it in the programme for creating a conducive environment to reintroduce tigers and making people aware of them to reduce human-animal conflict.In 2008, the reserve lost all its tigers. The forest department reintroduced a male and a female tiger in 2009. The tiger population in Panna has since increased to over 56, according to forest department officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/two-radio-collared-tigers-found-dead-in-madhya-pradesh-s-panna-tiger-reserve-101636700623123.html

Pradesh Congress Committee working president Chiranjib Biswal, on behalf of the party, assured the court that they will observe a peaceful bandh.In 1997, the SC, in Bharat Kumar K. Palicha and another Vs. State Of Kerala case, said bandhs are unconstitutional. The apex court said there cannot be any doubt that the fundamental rights of the people as a whole cannot be subservient to the claim of the fundamental right of an individual or only a section of the people.Earlier, the Congress party called for a statewide bandh in Odisha on November 12 from 6 am to 12 pm demanding the resignation of Dibya Shankar Mishra over his alleged links with Govind Sahu, the prime accused in the sensational Mamita Meher murder case.A decision in this regard was taken by the Odisha unit of the Congress at the party’s working committee meeting held on November 1. The meeting was attended by party’s Odisha in-charge A Chella Kumar and president, Odisha Pradesh Congress Committee, Niranjan Patnaik. Congress has also demanded the registration of a criminal case against the minister and his arrest.HC lawyer Soumya Mohanty, who appeared for Mishra, said, taking into account the gravity of the matter, the Court took up the petition for hearing. “Everyone would have to shut their business establishments voluntarily or under force had the bandh happened,” said Mohanty.Since last month, the opposition BJP has called bandhs in several western Odisha districts including Bolangir, Kalahandi and Bargarh demanding Mishra’s resignation over his alleged proximity to the main accused in the murder of Mamita Meher, a teacher in a private English medium school of Kalahandi district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/orissa-hc-says-congress-proposed-bandh-is-illegal-101636688443659.html
12-11-2021||Other||CEO of Odisha’s top govt IT agency falls victim to cybercrime||The chief executive officer of Odisha’s e-governance agency on Thursday fell victim to cybercrime when someone hacked into his WhatsApp account and duped his friends of ₹7 lakh faking financial distress.Manoj Kumar Pattnaik, chief executive officer of Odisha computer application centre, that powers several e-governance initiatives of the Odisha government, alleged that five of his contacts sent ₹7 lakh to a bank account since Tuesday afternoon after receiving WhatsApp messages that he needed money for treatment. Assuming the messages as genuine, some of the close contacts of Pattnaik transferred money to the bank and UPI accounts shared by the fraudster.“I received an unknown call on my WhatsApp on Tuesday afternoon. The caller did not utter a word and I hung up after around 30 seconds,” said Patnaik.Hours later, Patnaik realised the hacking of his WhatsApp account when some of his friends told him that they had received a message from him asking for money. Soon, he was flooded with phone calls from his contacts, including his office staff who sent money to the fraudster.The cybercrime wing later registered a complaint on its own with a deputy superintendent of police taking up the investigation of the case. Patnaik said he would lodge a formal complaint with the police on Friday. Some of his contacts, who became victims of the phishing messages, have already lodged complaints with the police.Ishaan Sinha, a renowned cybercrime investigator who has trained police forces of several states to fight cybercrime, said Patnaik may have fallen victim to a cybercrime practice called social engineering in which cybercriminals use cloning software and spoof call software to mimic a person.“These people trawl social media sites to see people with high net worth and use social engineering that involves manipulating people into breaking normal security procedures and best practices to gain unauthorized access to their contact list. They then mimic the person and call or send messages to their contacts making them believe to be coming from a genuine person. The number which the fraudsters call or send messages from can be a different number than that of the victim’s, but to his contacts, it appears to be genuine,” said Sinha.He said such frauds normally operate from Jamtara in Jharkhand, Bharatpur in Rajasthan, Mewat in Haryana, Mathura and Hathras in Uttar Pradesh. “Despite all their practices, these scamsters do get caught,” he said.As per the statistics of the National Crime Records Bureau, last year Odisha saw a 30% jump in cybercrimes compared to 2019 with many unsuspecting people falling victim to such crimes during online payment and UPI transactions. A total of 1,931 incidents of cybercrime were reported in 2020, an increase of 30.03 per cent from 1,485 in the previous year and a staggering 129 per cent hike from 843 in 2018, the NCRB report stated.The rate of cybercrime was 4.2 per lakh population in Odisha, higher than the national rate of 3.7, the NCRB’s ‘Crime in India 2020’ report said. With 220 cases, Odisha recorded the highest incidents of defamation, morphing and indecent representation of women.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ceo-of-odisha-s-top-govt-it-agency-falls-victim-to-cybercrime-101636687243094.html

Data from the Central Pollution Control Board showed that the hourly air quality index (AQI) at 7 am stood at 451. On Thursday, the average 24-hour AQI was 411.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.On Thursday, the Union ministry of earth science’s air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) said, “The AQI today is in the middle range of very Poor category. Winds at transport level (925 mb) have reduced today but no change in wind direction, so the air quality remained in the same category of ‘very poor’. It is likely to be in the ‘upper end of very poor’ to ‘severe’ category for the next two days. The effective fire count reduced to 3914 today.

12-11-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Sadhu with chai||His robe is saffron. His turban is black. His beard is white. His nails are long. But it is his gaze that is the most formidable aspect of his personality. So disconcertingly sharp and penetrating, like a mere touch of a razor which cuts deep into your flesh.“I’m a sadhu,” he says, the tone of his voice is soft and filled with extreme kindness, and at once shatters the earlier uneasiness caused by the directness of his eyes. Manglu, as he introduces himself, is sitting down on a central Delhi pavement, near the Ashram flyover. He is having chai, given to him (for free) by a tea stall owner, nearby. “I have no money… for a very long time I’ve been living without money,” he says. “I go to a dhaba and they offer me dal-chawal without me asking for it. I go to a chai stall and they offer me chai without me asking for it.”Manglu is sitting with his back resting on his two bundles, which are, he says, filled with blankets. His face looks calm, his posture has a languidity that comes after one’s body has grown used to its immediate surroundings. Perhaps he has been familiar with this footpath for long. “I’m new to Delhi,” he mutters, informing that he arrived some days back in a train from UP. Manglu agrees to give a sense of his biography, but does that in a handful of brief sentences. “I’m 70. I have lived most of my life inside and outside of temples, and always in the temples of holy towns. I was in Ayodhya for some years. Before Ayodhya, I was in Vrindavan. Before Vrindavan, I was in Kashi Vishwanath (Benares).”Manglu offers no reason why he has picked Delhi as his new address. After all, he doesn’t have any relative or friend here. “I have no friend or relative anywhere.” He says his parents are dead. “My father was a farmer near Ayodhya.” Manglu never married. He never feels lonely, he says. “I live in the sangat (company) of Gods.”Where will he live in Delhi? Will he try to find a temple for a long-term stay? Manglu becomes motionless. He directs his sharp gaze towards the cup of chai in his hand, as if lost in meditation, perhaps mulling on the query. In the end, following a long silence, as if slowly emerging from a process of careful deliberation, he speaks up—“I will sit here for some time.”Meanwhile, across the road—on the road divider actually—a fakir is sitting, quietly watching the traffic go by.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-sadhu-with-chai-101636671916350.html
12-11-2021||Delhi||New buildings in Delhi may need vector control steps||All new buildings coming up in the national capital may soon be required to obtain an additional “occupancy certificate” (OC) clearing the structures for several anti-mosquito measures on the premises, according to several officials familiar with the matter and documents seen by HT.As per a gazette notification by the Delhi government in October that made dengue, malaria and chikungunya notifiable diseases under the Epidemic Diseases Act, municipal health officers have been designated as the new controlling authority in this regard for all new buildings, both commercial and residential, and have been empowered to issue the occupation certificates.The decision comes at a time when cases of dengue -- a vector-borne disease that impacts the city every year -- are on the rise. Delhi’s dengue tally crossed the 2,000 mark on Monday, and civic bodies have reported a total of 2,708 cases till November 8 this year.The trend puts the 2021 outbreak on course to eclipse the one in 2018, when the city recorded 2,798 cases. The death toll, 9, is now the highest since 2017, when 10 people died of the infection. Delhi reported its worst dengue outbreak in 2015, when 16,000 people were infected and at least 60 died of the disease, according to official records.The new regulations, signed by Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal last month, state: “No person shall occupy a new building (government, semi-government or private) unless an occupation certificate is obtained from the controlling officer of the respective local body regarding the requirement of anti-mosquito systems in such premises.”A senior public health official from the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) said that detailed guidelines for builders and building owners will be issued soon. “There are several such provisions in the regulations issued in Daman and Diu (in 2016) as well as Goa, and they are being studied to formulate the Delhi guidelines,” an official involved in the process said on condition of anonymity.A second official said that regulations such as a prescribed minimum slope level on roofs to prevent water stagnation, and mosquito proofing of water tank covers and drains connecting water sources, among others, will be standardised based in the guidelines in line with the gazette notification issued by the Delhi government.Public health officials said that the developers will have to make the necessary changes in line with the anti-mosquito measures, without which the building cannot be legally occupied.So far, buildings in Delhi must have a “completion certification” -- a mandatory legal document which attests that a new building has been constructed, and completed according to fire safety norms and regulations of the Buildings Act. This certificate is awarded only if the local bodies are satisfied that the building has been constructed according to the approved building plan and unified building by-laws (UBBL) standards have been met.While existing buildings are not covered by the new occupancy certificate, officials said it remains the responsibility of owners or occupiers to ensure that there are no conditions conducive for mosquito breeding in the premises. While the new notification states that “no person shall maintain any collection of water in which mosquitoes breed”, there are existing provisions of issuing challans and legal notices if such conditions are found in the premises.A third SDMC public health official said that the buildings which have a sump well or overhead tank should have a mosquito-proof arrangement.“In many cases, we notice that the covers are inadequate to prevent mosquito breeding, and they are be easily dislodged. Overhead tanks are also an important source of mosquito breeding in vulnerable areas,” the official said.A 2018 analysis by the public health department found that the domestic water storage containers constituted 33% of the mosquito breeding sites detected by the domestic breeding checkers.“The guidelines will also incorporate the minimum slope level to prevent water stagnation and the designs of sunshades or porticos to minimise mosquito breeding sites. There should be a minimum number of drain outlets based on the catchment areas and netting can be mandated in case of water source that is open to sky,” the third official added.The notification also attempts to deal with the problem of residents not allowing the civic officials to check the mosquito breeding sites on their premises. “For the purpose of enforcing provisions of these regulations, the inspecting officer may enquire and inspect... any land or building and the occupier of building shall give all facilities necessary for such entry and inspection,” the notification states.It proscribes the obstruction, and says it can be treated as an offence under section 188 of Indian Penal Code.Meanwhile, builder groups welcomed the move even but said there should be safeguards to ensure it doesn’t become another bureaucratic hurdle.Pankaj Bajaj, the president of Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Association of India (NCR chapter), said that the developers have no in-principal objection.“We would welcome any move that is good for public but the necessary conditions should be incorporated within the existing framework of by-laws so that we don’t need a separate approval step. Enough public consultation should be carried out in this regard,” he said.Sunil Vohra, who heads Delhi Municipal Contractors Association, also said that the new occupancy certificate may become a harassment tool.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/new-buildings-in-city-may-need-vector-control-steps-101636670518704.html
12-11-2021||Delhi||AQI rebounds to severe zone as pollutants linger in Delhi's air||Pollution levels rose sharply on Thursday as winds died down, pushing the air quality index (AQI) back into the severe category after a day of slight respite when it was still very poor.The AQI was at 411 when the Central Pollution Control Board released its 4pm pollution bulletin, and by 10pm, it had risen to 431 with average PM10 and PM2.5 pollutant levels nearing the emergency threshold.The emergency threshold is when PM10 concentrations cross 500ug/m3 and PM2.5 300ug/m3.Weather experts attributed the deterioration to a drop in wind speed, which was caused by unusual circulation patterns over the country: a depression over the Bay of Bengal stretching into southern India and over parts of the eastern coast has blocked winds that sweep in from the northwest, flow over the Indo-Gangetic plains.The north-westerly winds are what bring in the smoke from farm fires in Punjab and Haryana, and as they flow further over the Indo-Gangetic plans, they eventually disperse these pollutants away as well.“South-easterly winds (due to the depression) have reached central India, up to Madhya Pradesh, and are stopping the stubble smoke-carrying north-westerly winds from passing freely. Since the winds are getting trapped over Delhi and adjoining areas, pollution is also concentrated over this region leading to high AQI recordings,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change), Skymet weather services.Such formations are unusual but they occur this time of the year every few years.Weather forecasters said such conditions could persist over the region for the next 24-48 hours.Thursday’s was the sharpest fall in air quality since the day after Diwali, when the AQI shot up to 462 from 382 a day before.The AQI remained in the severe zone for two days after that, relenting only on November 8 briefly when winds picked up.Now, with wind speeds in single digits, local pollutants are being trapped and mixed with emissions from farm fires. The Union ministry of earth science’ air quality early warning system said that the surface wind speed in the city on Thursday was only 4-8kmph, and this further dropped after sundown.The mixing depth—the height above the surface throughout which pollutants can be dispersed—in Delhi was 1,400 metres on Thursday. According to Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune, the ventilation index—a measure of air pollution based on the speed of the wind and the height of the column of air in which smoke or other pollutants mix—was also as low as 6,000m2/s.Experts say a ventilation index lower than 6,000 m2/s, along with an average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for the dispersion of pollutants.“Slow winds during daytime and calm winds during evening/night are extremely unfavourable for dispersion of pollutants. The air quality is likely to remain in the upper end of the very poor category on Friday and further deteriorate from November 15, and may reach the severe category. The predominant pollutant is expected to be PM2.5 (ultrafine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres),” a senior official of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), a central air quality monitoring centre, on Thursday 3,914 fires were reported from Punjab and Haryana, which contributed to 26% in Delhi’s PM 2.5 levels. This was only a notch down from the last two days when the share of stubble smoke in the air was 27%.“Fire pollution plume (carbon monoxide from the last two days of heavy stubble burning in northwest India is now spreading across the Indo-Gangetic Plains and parts of Madhya Pradesh...,” said Sachin Ghude, scientist and project lead at the IITM.This year, farm fires are taking place later than usual due to a delayed withdrawal of the monsoon rains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aqi-rebounds-to-severe-zone-as-pollutants-linger-in-city-air-101636670170838.html

12-11-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Sanitation a major concern in ward 4||Though part of City Beautiful, several localities in ward number 4 lack basic amenities, including access to clean drinking water, paved roads, and a proper garbage collection and disposal system. Prominent among these are Basti Kishangarh, Basti Bhagwanpura, and Shastri Nagar, which had panchayats that were disbanded after these became part of the municipal corporation in 2018. Having had no local authority for several years and set to vote for the first time in municipal corporation elections, residents here now want a councillor who is easily accessible and has the willingness to work for the development of the area.The other three localities—Manimajra (R), Indira Colony and IT Park, however, were earlier part of other wards, and are better in terms of sanitation and infrastructure.So far, no political party has announced its candidates from the ward.The ward has no planned system of garbage collection and disposal. Though in some areas, door-to-door garbage collection, with segregation of wet and dry waste, is done, heaps of garbage can still be seen on the roadsides. Even the forest areas, parks and dried nullahs are all filed with garbage.In Basti Kishangarh and Shastri Nagar, unpaved roads, clogged sewer lines and irregular water supply make life difficult for the residents. “Roads in the area are in a bad shape and carpeting has not been done for the last five years. Even when we had a sarpanch, no developmental works were initiated in the area but the condition worsened in 2018 when our basti was linked with the MC. Despite levying heavy taxes on electricity, water and garbage disposal, MC authorities are not providing the services as expected,” said Mewa Singh, 80, a retired military officer, who lives in Basti Kishangarh. Manoj Lubana, president of Chandigarh Youth Congress and resident of Basti Kishangarh, said “In late evening hours, people can be seen selling illegal liquor in the area. Basic needs such as clean drinking water, parks for children, sanitation, good roads and street lights are missing in the area of Chandigarh. The authorities should ensure development of rural areas and colonies on similar lines of urban sectors.”In Shastri Nagar area, residents have no option but to pay from their own pockets to ensure basic facilities. A 26-year-old resident of Shastri Nagar, Raju Harnarayan, said, “A tubewell got approved for the area but was never installed. Sometimes, the area doesn’t get access to drinking water for over a month. People have to walk to different areas to get buckets filled with water. With such poor conditions, how can we say that we are part of well-planned and beautiful city.”“We had to pay from our own pockets to install streetlights and sewerage system. Though the area is badly affected with dengue, health authorities never came here for fogging,” he added.Though people living in Indira Colony and IT Park have access to basic facilities, the areas lack maintenance and sanitation. Subhash Dhiman, chairman, resident welfare association, Indira Colony, who is also the vice-president of All Manimajra Welfare Association, said, “Residents expect better infrastructure and sanitation in the area. Carpeting of roads and provision of clean drinking water are the key issues which need to be resolved, immediately. In the long run, parks should be beautified and parking facilities should be made available for.” KNOW YOUR WARDLocalities: Manimajra (R), Basti Kishangarh, Basti Bhagwanpura, Indira Colony, IT Park and Shastri NagarSeat: Women reserved ward (general)Voters: Approximately 23,000Key Issues:• Poor infrastructure including roads, sewerage, streetlights• No access to clean drinking water• Garbage dumps on roads; poor sanitation and cleanlinessLOCAL VOICESRoad carpeting has not been done for the past five years.

Hence their pay scales will never match their respective peers in the university.“So, to bring about the parity in this context, the eligibility criteria for T-1, T-1 (flats) and F-type houses for senior assistant professors/senior lecturers of the dental institute should be 12 years of service when the assistant professors working in other teaching departments of Panjab University become eligible for these categories of houses (as they get promotion from assistant professor to associate professor in 12 years through CAS),” the letter states.They have also demanded that the condition of minimum basic pay of ₹40,000 for F-type houses and basic pay of 45,000 for G-type houses should be eliminated as it is not only arbitrary, unjustifiable but also discriminatory.Promotion policy matter pendingThe matter of promotion policy for the dental faculty of Panjab University is still hanging in balance at the university. Two years have already passed since members of the dental faculty of the university’s dental institute raised the issue regarding their promotion policy and approached the high court, the matter still hangs in balance at the university.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-panjab-university-house-allotment-committee-to-take-up-objections-of-dental-faculty-101636666421983.html
12-11-2021||Chandigarh||Jeev Milkha Singh Invitational: Shiv Kapur, Abhijit Chadha share round one lead at Chandigarh Golf Club||Six-time international winner Shiv Kapur and local lad Abhijit Singh Chadha got off to flying starts with brilliant rounds of eight-under 64 to share the first-round lead at the Jeev Milkha Singh Invitational 2021 being played at the Chandigarh Golf Club.While Dubai-based Kapur had a bogey-free day, two-time PGTI winner Chadha, playing at his home course, fired an eagle, seven birdies and a bogey.Delhi’s Rashid Khan produced an impressive error-free seven-under 65 to be placed third.Shiv Kapur, 39, who has had a few starts on the European Tour this year, picked up his first birdie of the day on the fifth hole and didn’t look back thereafter as he collected seven more birdies, including two on the 16th and 17th.Interestingly, Kapur had enjoyed a similar start at the 2018 edition of the event when he had shot the first round of 65 to be the joint leader.Shiv said, “I was solid all the way round. I didn’t birdie two of the short par-5s and left a couple of putts out there, but overall it was a clean card with no bogeys. I also holed my fair share of putts. I hit lots of fairways and all 18 greens in regulation. However, it’s a long way to go and I will look to try and build from here.“I’ve not played enough competitive golf of late, so I was worried about being a little bit rusty. But the good start to the week helped me shake off the rust. This is a great tune-up for me ahead of the restart of the Asian Tour in a couple of weeks from now.”Abhijit Singh Chadha, 30, who began his round from the 10th tee on Thursday, recorded a 64, courtesy his hot putter. After sinking his first birdie on the 13th, tall and lanky Abhijit added an eagle, six more birdies and a bogey to his card. He sank a 45-footer on the fifth and a 30-feet putt on the seventh.Newly-married Abhijit said, “The two 30-ft plus putts were the highlight of the round. It’s been a slow season for me, but I’ve worked a lot on my putting and things are coming together now. Playing in home conditions also always helps.”Chandigarh’s Yuvraj Singh Sandhu, the seasoned Gaurav Ghei of Delhi, Kshitij Naveed Kaul, another Delhi-based player, and Gurugram’s Tapy Ghai were all in tied fourth having shot scores of 67.Aadil Bedi was the third Chandigarh player in the top-10 as he struck a 68 to be tied eighth.Among the marquee names in the field, Jyoti Randhawa, SSP Chawrasia, Udayan Mane and former champion Ajeetesh Sandhu of Chandigarh carded 69s to be tied 12th while Gaganjeet Bhullar and former champion Chikkarangappa were a further shot back in tied 26th place.Chandigarh’s Karandeep Kochhar, the defending champion and PGTI Order of Merit leader, shot a 72 to be tied 50th.Tournament host Jeev Milkha Singh, who had good friends and fellow Chandigarh professionals Amritinder Singh and Gurbaaz Mann as his playing partners, returned a 75 to be placed tied 89th.Jeev said, “I was pleasantly surprised that I turned at even-par despite being so rusty. I managed myself quite well off the tee and kept it in play. On the front-nine, I made three bogeys from the centre of the fairway so that was a little disappointing and just showed that my iron-play was patchy today. I’m looking forward to a better second round.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jeev-milkha-singh-invitational-shiv-kapur-abhijit-chadha-share-round-one-lead-at-chandigarh-golf-club-101636666420925.html

12-11-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab assembly passes resolution against Centre’s 3 farm laws||The Punjab Vidhan Sabha on Thursday passed a resolution against the three contentious farm laws seeking their repeal, saying the Centre had “unlawfully ventured into the state’s domain”. The House also passed the Punjab Agricultural Produce Market (Amendment) Bill, 2021, to “safeguard the interests of farmers” and also annulled a law on contract farming passed by the state assembly in 2013. The House saw five adjournments and naming (barred from attending the session) of all the Akali MLAs during the discussion, as all attempts by speaker Rana KP Singh to diffuse the situation proved futile. In October last year, the Vidhan Sabha had also passed a resolution against the farm laws when Amarinder Singh was the chief minister and also introduced three bills as an attempt to negate the central legislations. But the bills remained with the governor and were never sent to the President for approval. The situation on Thursday got out of control after chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi targeted Akali MLA Bikram Singh Majithia. Angry party legislators led by Majithia walked into the well of the House and had a heated exchange of words with their counterparts on the treasury benches as the former sought an apology from the CM. Channi hurriedly announced to table a “white paper” on power sector, but the SAD members continued to protest, forcing another adjournment. Accepting that the words used against Majithia were “uncalled for”, the speaker ordered five adjournments and expunged Channi’s remarks besides taking the MLAs of the ruling party and that of SAD to his chamber in a bid to pacify them. Following a warning, the speaker ordered the Akali MLAs to go out of the House for the remaining period of the sitting as they refused to stop raising anti-CM slogans and remained adamant on apology. It was second and concluding day of the last session of the Congress government’s current tenure, specially called to pass resolution on the farm laws and table a white paper on power purchase agreements (PPAs) signed during the previous Akali-BJP government. Earlier, agriculture minister Randeep Singh Nabha moved the resolution followed by a debate during which state Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu blamed the SAD for the three laws, claiming that a beginning was made by then CM Parkash Singh Badal by notifying the Contract Farming Act, 2013. “The three laws (by the Centre) are extension of the one passed by the Akalis,” Sidhu said. Leader of opposition and Aam Aadmi Party MLA Harpal Singh Cheema also accused the Akalis of supporting the farm laws. “SAD president Sukhbir Badal, Parkash Singh Badal and then Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal supported the laws and only snapped ties with the BJP when farmers started an agitation,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-assembly-passes-resolution-against-centre-s-3-farm-laws-101636665703034.html
12-11-2021||Chandigarh||J&K: Private schools forcing parents to buy new books, uniforms to be derecognised||With private schools forcing parents to purchase new books and uniforms from the school campus or designated shops, the government has threatened to derecognise schools if they do not desist from the practice.The school session in Kashmir is already over or on its last legs in many private schools have not only changed the books and uniforms but also asked parents to buy books from particular shops or from the campus where stalls have been set up. Many parents have slammed the schools’ move saying it was a new way to make money. “It is a big scam,” said Manzor Ahmad, a government employee, whose son got promoted to next class last week. “The school has also changed the books. This is the pattern after every two years. Either they change half the books or the whole set to force parents to buy new books,” he said. Another parent, Ishfaq Ahmad said schools did this to earn commission and despite government orders the big schools are continuing with the practice. Kashmir director of school education Tasaduq Mir said, “It has again come to the notice of this directorate that recognised private schools are selling books and uniforms on the school premises. Parents are being forced to purchase books from some specific private shops. Besides, the exercise of replacing existing books with the new ones is becoming the norm for recognised unaided private schools. This has been viewed very seriously. The practice is against the instructions already issued on the subject vide series of communications issued earlier.” Meanwhile, defending the decision to change books, the principal of a private school, requesting anonymity, said, “We change books after five or six years when we feel students need new books according to the new curriculum. This is a baseless allegation that schools change books every year. If this is being done then action should be taken against such schools or administrations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jkprivate-schools-forcing-parents-to-buy-new-books-uniforms-to-be-derecognised-101636665640490.html

The Congress government, he said, had become frustrated over the fact that no case could be made out against him in any of the earlier drug cases in which they were trying to frame him. “This is why the CM took the route of levelling false allegations against me. I want to make it clear that I will not be intimidated by such tactics. I only raised the sentiments of the people in the special session and I don’t have any ill will against Channi,” he said.Majithia claimed that when Channi was an MLA he had been taken him along to plead the case of his brother Manmohan Singh before then deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal when Manmohan’s name had cropped up in the Ludhiana City Centre scam.The Akali leaders said that even Congress ministers like Brahm Mohindra, Tript Rajinder Bajwa and Pargat Singh admitted that the CM used derogatory remarks against Majithia in the House. “Some Congress MLAs like Kuldeep Singh Zira even threatened our member Pawan Kumar Tinu,” said the Akali legislators.Earlier, during the House proceedings, the Akali MLAs wore black gowns to register their protest against problems faced by farmers, including the DAP fertiliser shortage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/akali-leader-majithia-dares-punjab-cm-channi-to-give-single-proof-of-wrongdoing-by-him-101636665405153.html
12-11-2021||Chandigarh||Special assembly session: Punjab government tables ‘white paper’ on private thermal plants||The Charanjit Singh Channi-led Congress government on Thursday tabled a ‘white paper’ in the Vidhan Sabha, with a focus on shortcomings in setting up of private thermal plants in the state when the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) was in power. On the second day of the two-day special session for discussion on the power purchase agreements (PPAs), the government in a nine-page document said these thermal plants caused loss to the state exchequer to the tune of crores of rupees besides burdening the consumers. Taking part in a debate, finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal said that these thermal plants put an additional burden of ₹50,000 crore and the power requirement was jacked up from 2,000 megawatt to 4,000 MW to bring in more private players by the then SAD-BJP government, ignoring the estimates given by the Centre. “Initially, a proposal was to set up plants under the build, operate and transfer (BOT) system but were actually executed under the build, operate and own (BOO) mode by the then government, thus benefitting the private players,” he added. The cancellation of PPAs was one of the Congress’ promises ahead of the 2017 polls. The assembly also introduced the Punjab Energy Security Reform, Termination and Re-determination of Power Tariffs Bill, 2021, to provide remedial measure for development of the power sector. The bill has clauses of termination of PPAs and re-determination of tariff. Similarly, the Punjab Renewable Energy Security Reform, Termination and Re-determination of Power Tariff Bill, 2021, was introduced to deal with PPAs from renewable energy sources. The ‘white paper’ mentions that the PPAs do not have a provision to impose penalty in case the plants fails to supply power during the peak paddy season.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/special-assembly-session-punjab-government-tables-white-paper-on-private-thermal-plants-101636665107449.html

Ropar was the least polluted with 161 AQI.Sangrur district registered maximum 566 fresh cases of farm fires in the state and Mohali the lowest at six. A Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) official said the AQI will continue to deteriorate in the coming days as there is no respite from stubble burning cases in the state. “The major bottleneck in the management of paddy stubble is the small window between paddy harvesting and sowing of wheat,” he said.Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ugarahan) leader Manjit Singh said farmers had no alternative but to burn the paddy residue as the government had failed to provide any assistance to curb the problem.“Mere machinery won’t help as a farmer has to spend at least ₹5,000 to dispose of stubble over one acre. How can farmers afford this when they are already in financial distress? We are demanding ₹200 per quintal from the state government to manage stubble,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-records-55-573-farm-fires-so-far-patiala-has-worst-aqi-among-cities-101636664800395.html

Incidentally, the market had been opened just before the byelections last month. “Such a decision soon after losing the election in Fatehpur exposes the malice and anti-farmer policy of the state government,” said HKS state president Kuldeep Singh Tanwar.“It was said that procurement at the Riyali Grain Market was to continue till November 30. However, procurement was stopped much earlier without prior notice,” he said, The name of Riyali Grain Market has also been removed from the government portal. The Food Corporation of India (FCI) has cited the lack of paddy inflow in the Riyali market for the same. However, farmers say a large portion of paddy crop is yet to be harvested in the area. “The FCI is acting on behest of state government,” alleged Talwar, adding that if procurement of paddy in the Riyali market is not resumed, the Mand unit of HKS and the Kisan Samyukta Sangharsh Samiti will launch a stir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/closure-of-riyali-market-reprisal-for-fatehpur-defeat-himachal-farmers-body-101636664680406.html

The accused were not arrested yet, police said. A case was registered against Mann and his driver Gurvinder Singh at the Ferozepur city police station under Sections 307 (attempt to murder) and 279 (rash driving) of the Indian Penal Code and the Arms Act. In his complaint, Harnek Singh Mehma, SKM leader and the district president of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (Dakaunda), said Mann fired three bullets at him and Lovepreet Singh besides firing four rounds in the air to intimidate the farmer protesters in Ferozepur on Wednesday.The complainant said that Mann’s driver Gurvinder tried to hit them with the vehicle. Some people sustained injuries due to the alleged rash driving that was aimed at attacking the SKM activists, it was alleged.Ferozepur senior superintendent of police (SSP) Harmandeep Singh Hans did not respond to repeated phone calls and messages.Ferozepur range deputy inspector general of police (DIG) Inderbir Singh said, “An FIR was lodged on the basis of the complaint filed by the farmer leader. We have to ascertain various charges made against Mann and his driver. The police have not registered an FIR against the farmer activists yet.” The police officials were silent on any evidence in the allegations levelled by SKM and SAD against each other of indiscriminate firing at a crowded place in the city. There was no confirmation either of the police having found bullet shells from the spot.The FIR was registered after the SKM activists started an indefinite dharna outside the Ferozepur police headquarters on Thursday morning. The dharna was lifted after their demand for registration of a criminal case against the Akali leaders was met. Rubbishing the charges levelled against him, Mann accused the police of working under political pressure.He alleged that it was the protesters who fired on his vehicle.The protesters forcibly stopped his SUV and jumped on its bonnet, but the driver drove to save the occupants, including him, from the mob, he alleged. “On Wednesday evening, I submitted a complaint and video and photographic evidence to the police about the attack on us but no action was taken. Several videos are in the public domain where my SUV was seen attacked and damaged by the mob. My official security guard Karamvir Singh was also attacked by the goons after he opened fire in the air to protect me from the violent mob,” Mann claimed.The clash between the SKM and Akali activists took place on Wednesday when Bathinda MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal was in the city to hold political programmes. Harsimrat has accused the Congress leadership of planning an attack on the Akali leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ferozepur-clash-akali-candidate-from-guru-har-sahai-booked-for-murder-bid-on-skm-activists-101636664021016.html

The police cordoned off the area and also covered the shell with sand bags. A bomb disposal team was also called to defuse the shell. According to the locals out on evening walk, a rocket-like structure was lying near the compound wall of the park. On observing closely, they found it to be a live rocket shell, following which the police were alerted. Joint commissioner of police J Elanchezhian said immediately after receiving the information, a team reached the spot and vacated the park. He added that the police have taken all security measures and there was no need to be panicked. However, people have been warned against going near the spot. Elanchezhian said that a technical team was called for defusing it. The police are also in contact with the army, it has been learnt. The police suspect that the shell could have come in the scrap from bay countries. As per them, the importer might have dumped it in the canal and some group of boys searching for coins on Thursday during the Chhath Pooja could have found the shell and left it in the park. However, the police are scanning the footage of CCTV cameras installed in the area to get clues on how it reached the park. Previous similar incidentsOn October 24, some workers had found 200 buried cartridges in a government school while digging the land for making a recharge pit in Pawa village. The Sahnewal police had registered an FIR and initiated investigation.On February 9, 2020, rocket shells, hand grenades, three rocket launchpads and other ammunition were found from a plot in Gill village in Ludhiana while digging.

12-11-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: 224 more farm fires seen this year, official says data misleading||The air Ludhiana residents breathed on Thursday continued to remain in ‘poor’ category with PM 2.5 count reaching 262, a major reason for which is attributed to spike in stubble burning incidents. The data provided by Punjab Remote Sensing Centre shows that Ludhiana has witnessed 224 more cases of farm fires as it did last year during the corresponding period. While 4,330 cases were reported in 2020, 2021 has so far seen 4,554 farm fires. In 2019, the figure was 2,532, while 2,481 incidents were logged in 2018. A year before that, 3,239 cases of stubble burning were registered. Daler Singh, a former agriculture department official, said it has been noticed that fire incidents see a rise during the period preceding the election year. “We had witnessed a spurt in farm fires in 2016 (7,697) and similarly, such incidents are on the rise this year as well. It appears that the authorities have been directed to go soft on farmers and not to penalise them for setting stubble on fire. As the state is due to go to polls early next year, the government does not wish to rattle the farmers, who are also agitating against the three farm laws.”In Punjab, the number of FIRs registered in 2019 was 1,737, which fell to 48 in 2020. This year, the number is zero. An official, requesting anonymity, said even last year, the administration had gone easy on farmers as they had begun protesting against the central government. However, a farm union leader said the stubble management has become completely infeasible due to high input cost. “With the rise in diesel prices and other farm machinery items, the in-situ and ex-situ management of paddy straw has become very expensive. Farmers are already under financial stress. If the government wants farmers to handle straw, they must provide ₹5,000 per acre as incentive,” said Jagtar Singh from BKU (Ugrahan).It was on November 1 that the authorities had claimed 37% dip in the stubble burning cases. But in the next 10 days, a record number of crop residue burning incidents were witnessed in the district. According to chief agricultural officer Narinder Singh Benipal, the data is misleading. “It has been noticed that farmers are not setting entire stubble kept in the field on fire. Instead, they are setting afire a small portion of crop residue, which is also being reflected in the fire incidents data,” he said. Meanwhile, amid the reports of hoarding leading to the shortage of DAP fertiliser, Baldev Singh, joint director, agriculture (inputs), visited Ludhiana and assessed its availability. He said reports of tagging of non-essential products by cooperative societies and private dealers were pouring in and warned of action against those involved in such activities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-224-more-farm-fires-seen-this-year-official-says-data-misleading-101636663724084.html
12-11-2021||Chandigarh||Himachal CM Jai Ram gives PWD the stick over pace of road projects||Underscoring that roads are the lifeline of the hill state, Himachal chief minister Jai Ram Thakur on Thursday asked state public works department officials to expedite construction and maintenance of roads in the state. Presiding over a review meeting of the PWD, the chief minister said, “The state government will take serious note of the delay in achieving financial targets and achievements under NABARD (National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development). “Not only do the delays hamper development, but they also adversely affect funding for the state. The government will take strict action against the erring officers in case of any laxity,” said Thakur.

12-11-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: Industrialists’ protest against increasing rate of raw materials takes ‘unique’ turn||Continuing their protest against the rising prices of raw materials in a ‘unique’ way, industrialists under the banner of Consortium of Industrial Associations sold tea at the protest site outside the office of United Cycle and Parts Manufacturers Association (UCPMA) on Gill Road on Thursday. The protest by different industrial associations entered its tenth day on Thursday. Symbolising how the prices remain in control when the power is in hands of the government, but tend to increase rapidly when the control is shifted to private sector and big corporates, the industrialists fixed the rate of ‘Modi’ tea at ₹2 per cup and ‘Ambani/Adani’ tea at ₹500 per cup. The industry has been demanding formation of a regulatory commission at the central level to control the rising prices of raw material and inflation in the country. Stating that the big corporate houses are “increasing the rates by forming cartels and enjoying monopoly”, the protesting industrialists said that the prices of steel have almost doubled in the last two years. Not only steel, but prices of other raw materials like rubber, aluminium, and nickel have also risen arbitrarily, they added. Representatives of different industrial sectors, including bicycle, hosiery, auto parts and textile, have been participating in the protest. General secretary of FICO Rajeev Jain and general secretary of UCPMA Manjinder Sachdeva said many of the small units were on the verge of collapsing due to the rising prices of steel and other raw materials. “The government should fulfil the demand of the industry and form a regulatory commission, otherwise we will be forced to raise the agitation to the next level and it will be spread across the state,” they added. Send money collected during agitation to DelhiAccusing the Union government of favouring big corporate houses in exchange of kickbacks, the protesters sent a demand draft of ₹3,512 to the Centre along with a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, apprising him of the rising prices of raw material.The amount was collected during the symbolic protest organised by them on Wednesday, wherein they begged from commuters. Sachdeva stated that ₹1,500 was also collected by selling tea during the protest on Thursday and that amount will also be transferred to the PM Modi as a fund, so that the Union government pays heed to their problems||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-industrialists-protest-against-increasing-rate-of-raw-materials-takes-unique-turn-101636663360372.html

The child did not experience any side-effects, officials said.Covovax— a vaccine against Covid-19 for children, which is primarily developed by the US firm Novavax Inc, will be mass produced by Pune-based Serum Institute of India, mainly for the below-18 age group. Covovax is the third Covid-19 vaccine to be tested in children in India, after Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin and Zydus Cadila’s ZyCoV-D.PGIMER is among the 10 institutes conducting the trials, aimed at checking the safety and immune response of the vaccine. The institute aims to immunise around 100 children, with two doses of 0.5 ml each, on Day 1 and Day 22 respectively. “After receiving vaccine vials on Wednesday, we inoculated the first dose to a child. The child was kept under observation for 30 minutes. The child didn’t suffer any side effects post the jab. The vaccine is safe and we have given appointments to other children, who will be administered the vaccine in coming days,” said Dr Madhu Gupta, professor, Community Medicine and School of Public Health, and Principal Investigator of the project.So far, around 100 children, aged between 2 and 17, have registered to volunteer in the trials. “The children will be screened for eligibility and the vaccine will only be inoculated to those with stable health conditions,” said Dr Madhu Gupta, adding that in the initial stages of the trials, the efficacy of Covovax is said to be over 90%. After administering both the doses, children will be screened and the results will be studied for six months. The institute will submit its findings to the SII and Government of India.

Addressing the House after the tabling of the White Paper on power sector (2006-07 to 2020-21), Channi said he was ordering the vigilance department to fix responsibility on those involved in derailing the state’s economy by looting the state exchequer for their vested interests. “These PPAs hit the power sector and resulted in high cost of power in the state. Such was the process adopted for these PPAs that in some cases, rates were negotiated thrice without tenders,” said Channi, reiterating his government’s commitment to nail dishonest leaders of the SAD-BJP government, who amassed ill-gotten wealth through mafias of sand, transport and drugs.Welcoming Channi’s announcement, leader of opposition Harpal Singh Cheema demanded that the vigilance probe needed to be time-bound. Channi, however, chose not to respond. Before this, finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal had said that the PPAs had cost the government ₹50,000 crore. Higher education minister Pargat Singh had said that Punjab never needed the power, as projected in the PPAs.On sacrilege cases, Channi said investigations would be brought to a logical conclusion, so that perpetrators of such heinous crime were given exemplary punishment. Channi adds big sharks involved in drug mafia would not be spared. The CM added he was quite hopeful that sealed reports on drugs menace would be opened on November 18 with the intervention of Punjab and Haryana high court. Training his guns at Majithia, the CM said the Akali leader was trying to intentionally disturb the special session, since its start just to find an excuse to be ousted from the House. “Majithia and his party men didn’t have courage to face the criticism against Akali Dal’s misdeeds of rampant corruption and nepotism during its misrule of over 10 years,” he claimed. Lambasting the AAP for ridiculing the state government for taking pro-people decisions, Channi added that he was from a humble background and was an Aam Aadmi (common man) in the real sense. “I am well-versed with a common man’s concerns and hardships and am working to make life easier for them,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/channi-announces-vigilance-probe-into-ppas-101636660420118.html

She told me that Pawan had misbehaved with her and threatened to kill her if she narrated the incident to anyone,” she added.“Then, coach Pawan pulled out a gun and fired multiple shots at my daughter. She collapsed after receiving bullet wounds. Pawan then fired shots at me and chased my son Suraj, who was running towards the village. I saw them firing several bullets, which hit him and he too died on the spot,” she added.‘Academy has no connection with Olympian wrestler’Kharkhauda assistant superintendent of police Myank Gupta said the academy was named after wrestler Sushil Kumar, but they have found no links with the Olympics wrestler.Relatives of the deceased said she had started wrestling while in school and had won a silver medal in the All India University Inter-Wrestling Tournament in 2018.According to local residents, Pawan had opened the academy in Halalpur village about five years ago and was training around 45 trainees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/two-arrested-in-sonepat-wrestler-brother-murder-case-101636659040141.html

Later, his wife and former councillor Pushpa Lata alleged that Raghunath had been receiving extortion calls from another gangster Virender Pratap aka Kala Rana, Kulbhashan said.“Rana had told Jatheri to kill Raghu for not giving the extortion money. During his two-day remand that ended on Thursday, Jatheri confessed to the STF that he had sent the shooters. He has been sent back to Faridabad jail from where he was brought on production remand,” the DSP said.At least seven suspects, including the shooters, have been arrested in the murder case by the CIA-1 unit that investigated the case for almost a year. During interrogation, one of the suspects revealed the involvement of Jatheri.The gangster had earlier escaped from police custody near Faridabad, due to which the whole judicial complex in Yamunanagar was almost sealed during his court appearance on Tuesday.Investigators said Jatheri, a native of Sonepat in Haryana, was arrested by the special cell of the Delhi Police on July 31 this year from a dhaba near Sarsawa toll plaza on Saharanpur-Yamunanagar highway.Inspector Nirmal Singh of the STF unit said he has been involved in over 25 cases of murder, attempt to murder and extortion-related charges in Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh.“Jathedi also confessed to seeking extortion money from mining contractors in Yamunanagar through a video, along with his accomplice Rana. In the murder case, fresh challan will be presented before the court and will make raids to nab Rana, who is absconding,” inspector Singh said.The said video was reported by the cyber cell of the Yamunanagar police in August last year, where a constable-rank police officer found the video on Kala Rana’s profile on Instagram. Rana is said to have been operating from a foreign land.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/gangster-kala-jatheri-confesses-to-involvement-in-bizman-murder-101636658861066.html

12-11-2021||Delhi||Vehicles biggest contributor to particulate pollution in Delhi: Study||Among the local sources of pollution in Delhi, vehicles have emerged as the biggest contributor to particulate pollution, with their real-time share touching more than 50% during the early phase of winter, between October 24 and November 8, 2021, an analysis released by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) on Thursday showed.The analysis, based on data generated by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, showed that after traffic, household sources, industries and construction were the other leading sources of pollution in the Capital.Particulate matter is the general term for inhalable particles in the air such as aerosols, smoke, fumes, dust, ash and pollen.During the period from October 24 to November 8, which also saw pre-Diwali rush and snarls, the CSE said traffic speeds fell noticeably and congestion touched the pre-pandemic levels. The CSE said it accessed data for every alternate hour, for the period between October 24 and November 8, to arrive at the conclusion that vehicular emissions contributed over 50% to the particulate pollution, followed by household pollution sources, whose share ranged between 12.5-13.5%.This was followed by industries (9.9-13.7%), construction sources (6.7-7.9%), waste burning (4.6-4.9%) and road dust, which contributed between 3.6-4.1% to the total pollution load during the studied period.“Clearly, after the closure of all coal-based power plants, expansion of natural gas usage in industry and controls on dirty fuels, vehicles have emerged as the biggest real-time contributor among all local sources of winter pollution in Delhi this year. Action on transportation has to gather strong momentum. At the same time, action on waste management, clean energy access to households, and dust control must be expedited,” says Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, CSE.The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) data for this period shows while the hourly average PM2.5 concentration touched nearly 2,000 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) on Diwali day, stations prior to Diwali were recording peak pollution levels of 500-600µg/m3 during the day — readings that are 10 times the national-safe limit of 60µg/m3. Data from a station such as the one in RK Puram, an area that sees heavy traffic during the day, showed a spike in pollution between 8am and 9am.However, the biggest spike in pollution during the day occurred after 7pm, as the temperatures dropped. Levels at the station ranged between 200-400 µg/m3 through the day, according to the data.CSE said while the analysis only focuses on internal sources of pollution, the contribution from stubble (biomass) burning was low until November 3 and only picked up significantly from November 5. It found that while contribution from sources of pollution in NCR dominated between November 2 and 6, accounting for a total pollution share as high as 70-80%, its share declined after Diwali and Delhi’s own sources of pollution increased, along with stubble burning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/vehicles-biggest-contributor-to-particulate-pollution-in-delhi-study-101636658799939.html

MCM officials said that these shop owners have encroached upon government land and the road could not be widened because of this. The department has given the violators a week’s time to remove the encroachments.This 44-foot-wide road connects Manesar village to Gurugram and was developed and maintained by Public Works Department (PWD) but now has been transferred to MCM. The corporation wanted to expand the road but, during a survey, found that the road was heavily encroached upon.RS Bhath, district town planner, enforcement, who also has the charge of Municipal Corporation of Manesar, said that they had received complaints regarding illegal encroachments on the revenue road. “When the team conducted a survey, it found that notices had been issued by another civic agency earlier as well, but residents had not removed the violations. We have to widen the road and need to remove encroachments for this purpose. Either the owners must remove the encroachments themselves or they will be demolished by the department,” he said.MCM officials said that not only this road, but all revenue roads under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Corporation of Manesar will be surveyed and a drive will be launched to remove encroachments. “The Municipal Corporation of Manesar is under the development stage and it is important that revenue roads, village roads and municipal land including ponds and common areas are protected from encroachments. These areas play an important role in the future planning of urban infrastructure, amenities and rainwater harvesting,” said Bhath.MCM officials said that if owners of land and violators don’t remove encroachments from public land then government officials will carry out demolitions and register criminal complaints against repeat offenders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/over-100-notices-issued-against-encroachers-in-manesar-101636657841326.html

The police had also arrested an assistant sub-inspector (ASI) of the Delhi Police’s special cell in connection with the theft on October 9. The doctors, Sachinder Jain Nawal and GP Singh, were arrested for allegedly providing details of the cash and its location to gangster Vikas Langharpuria, who allegedly hatched a conspiracy and sent eight of his men to execute the theft.According to police, the theft was committed at the maintenance office of the residential society in Sector 82 on August 4. On August 20, when an employee of the maintenance company went to collect the cash, to deposit it in the bank, he realised that it was missing. After scanning the CCTV footage, the company discovered that the money had been stolen. Varun Dahiya, inspector of the STF, Gurugram unit, said during investigation, they found out about the alleged role of the doctors as the gangster’s close aide was in touch with them. “Someone from the maintenance company of the society where the theft took place was in touch with GP Singhwho shared the details of the money with a close aide of Langharpuria, who is currently in hiding and operating his gang to carry out thefts, robbery, loot and extortions,” he said. Dahiya said they are still conducting searches in several areas and have recovered cash and jewellery and a share of the loot that was allegedly given to the doctors. “The doctors revealed crucial information which can help us arrest more people in this case. It is too early to disclose the information but this is one of the biggest heists planned by the gang,” he said. A case under sections 380 (theft), 381 theft by clerk or servant), 454 (house trespass), 457 (housebreaking) and 120 B (conspiracy) of Indian Penal Code was registered against the two doctors on Wednesday night, said police.

12-11-2021||Lucknow||SP MLA held in Amethi over ‘shramdaan’ for road construction||LUCKNOW Two days after ending his nine-day-long fast to demand construction of a road, Samajwadi Party (SP) MLA from Gauriganj Rakesh Pratap Singh was “arrested” by the Amethi police on Thursday over his “shramdaan” for the construction of the same road.From his detention at Amethi police lines, Singh said: “This government hadn’t been constructing the road, which it had promised to. And now when people got together to construct the road and invited me for ‘shramdaan’ (voluntary work), the police arrested me.”“Rakesh Pratap Singh was detained with some of his supporters for a few hours as a preventive measure to ensure law and order situation. Later, they were released after they agreed to co-operate with local administration in ensuring peace,” said Vinod Kumar Pandey, ASP (Amethi). Singh said after he ended his nine-day-long fast in Lucknow, on the appeal of SP president Akhilesh Yadav, he returned to his constituency. “On Thursday, a large number of people, including some gram pradhans, contractors engaged in infrastructure works, gathered with road rollers, pavers and began constructing the Khadu Nalla road, which is nine km long and had been in bad shape. The people, with the help of machines, had put ballast on a six-kilometre stretch on the road and paved it also. But the police stopped the work and arrested me. At present, I am at the Amethi police lines,” he said.Singh had tendered his resignation from the UP Assembly on October 31, alleging that the state’s BJP government did not keeps its promises and sat on ‘anshan’ (protest fast) at the Mahatma Gandhi statue at the GPO Park here.Accusing the state government of being insensitive, the SP chief directed party MLA and leader of opposition in the UP Assembly Ram Govind Chaudhary to convince Singh to end his agitation.Singh was admitted to the hospital by the police on Saturday on the advice of doctors after being picked up from the GPO Park, but he continued his protest in the hospital. On Tuesday evening, senior SP leaders gave him a glass of juice to end his fast, a party release stated.In his appeal to the MLA, Yadav said it was futile to protest against the government as it was not ready to listen. “It is better to end the fast and get ready to fight the BJP in the upcoming elections,” he said.Uttar Pradesh goes to Assembly polls early next year and SP MLA Rakesh Pratap Singh is looking to re contest the seat on SP ticket.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/sp-mla-held-in-amethi-over-shramdaan-for-road-construction-101636657481360.html
12-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi HC seeks DDA response on plea by street vendors over Master Plan 2021||The Delhi high court on Thursday sought a response from the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) on a plea by the National Hawkers Federation, challenging the Master Plan of 2021.A bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh issued notice to the DDA on the petition which claimed that the Delhi Master Plan 2021 does not take into account the Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Act, 2014.The petitioner, which claimed to be an association of street vendors and 1,188 unions in the country, said the overarching objective of the Street Vendors Act, 2014, is to provide for and promote a supportive environment for the urban street vendors to carry out their vocation while ensuring that vending activities do not lead to overcrowding and unsanitary conditions in public spaces and streets.However, the Master Plan 2021 – which was approved in 2007—“wrongfully retains” provisions that do not reflect the criteria set out for street vendors under the Street Vendors Act, the petitioner said.The plea said street vendors form an integral part of the economy of the state and most of them have been forced to secure their livelihoods by carrying on trade on the streets because the government authorities “miserably failed to secure a decent livelihood for the urban poor”.In the petition, the petitioner has contended that the sections for “informal sector” under the Master Plan are “manifestly arbitrary” and make no mention of the Street Vendors Act which provides for plan for street vending and the formation of town vending committees.The matter would be heard next on January 12.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hc-seeks-dda-response-on-plea-by-street-vendors-over-master-plan-2021-101636657479982.html

12-11-2021||Gurugram||Cousin stalks woman, throws acid on her in Gurugram||A 21-year-old executive working in an e-commerce company suffered serious burn injuries on Wednesday after her cousin allegedly threw acid on her for refusing to marry him. The incident took place in Farrukhnagar outside the woman’s paying guest (PG) accommodation while she was talking to her mother on her mobile phone. The neighbours caught the suspect while he tried to flee the spot and handed him over to the police, said officers investigating the matter. Devender Singh, station house officer of Farrukhnagar police station, said that they received information around 8.30pm that a man had thrown acid on a woman and locals had caught him. “The woman was admitted to a private hospital. Doctors said that she has lost vision in both eyes. She suffered burn injuries in her eyes, face, neck, hands, and stomach,” he said. Her condition is stable, doctors at the hospital said.Police said the suspect initially claimed to be the woman’s husband, a statement the woman later refuted. She said he was her cousin and already married.The suspect, Ravinder Singh alias Ravi, from Hisar, works at a private company in Farrukhnagar and claimed he had been trying to “meet his wife” for over a month. “We informed her family members of the incident. They reached the hospital late Wednesday night,” he said. The woman, in her statement to the police at the hospital, said that Ravi had smeared her forehead with vermillion at a temple a few months ago and, since then, kept pressuring her to get married to him. She had refused him several times, she said. “He was holding a grudge against me for turning down his marriage proposal. On Wednesday, he came to my PG accommodation, caught hold of my hair and threw acid on my face. I shouted for help, after which my colleagues rushed towards me and caught him,” she said.Singh said that Ravi had been following the woman for the last few days and was keeping a close watch on her activities. “He tried to flee the spot but was caught. The woman raised an alarm and started crying in pain and sought help from people. Her friends then rushed out and saw her,” he said. One of the eyewitnesses, Khushi (who goes by her first name), said that she was walking nearby when she witnessed the incident. “Within minutes, she was vomiting and shouting in pain. She could not even see anything,” she said. The woman is from Jind in Haryana and works at an e-commerce company in Farrukhnagar. The police said that the woman had been trying to avoid him and had asked him not to call or meet her but he had disregarded her requests. A case of voluntarily causing grievous hurt by use of acid against Ravi was registered under Section 326A of the India Penal Code at Farrukhnagar police station. Ravi will be produced before the court on Friday, said police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/cousin-stalks-woman-throws-acid-on-her-in-gurugram-101636657360000.html
12-11-2021||Bangalore||Police send 4 laptops of Bitcoin case accused for forensic scan||Bengaluru police on Thursday sought permission from a local court to send hacker Srikrishna Ramesh alias Sriki’s laptops for forensic examination.Even though Karnataka chief minister had denied any scandal in the cryptocurrency hacking case involving Srikrishna, police have sent four of Ramesh’s laptops to Forensic Sciences Lab (FSL) in Bengaluru. According to police, these laptops were seized following Srikrishna’s arrest on Monday from a five star hotel on charges of consumption of drugs. The development comes as the Congress has been accusing the BJP government of trying to cover up the case and on the day chief minister Basavaraj Bommai met Prime Minister Narendra Modi. A day after the Congress levelled allegations on links between hacker Srikrishna Ramesh and BJP leaders in the alleged Bitcoin scandal, senior officers of the Bengaluru police rebutted the claims. Presenting their versions of the investigation, two senior police officers of Bengaluru police said that several claims made by the hacker couldn’t be verified during the investigation, which is being highlighted by the Opposition. The hacker in question, Srikrishna, was arrested by the Central Crime Branch (CCB) police on November 18, 2020, in a drug peddling case. He had bought drugs from international dealers using Bitcoins on the dark web. In the interrogation that followed, CCB found that the software engineer was also involved in a series of online crimes. He confessed to hacking and stealing from three Bitcoin exchanges, 14 company websites, including 10 poker websites, and a government portal. The Opposition had raised several questions about the investigation, especially about police not disclosing information about Srikrishna’s involvement in hacking incidents in the past, one of them being the 2016 hacking of Bitfinex cryptocurrency exchange. During his interrogation, Srikrishna confessed to being part of a group of hackers that broke into a cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex on August 2, 2016. These hackers collectively stole 120,000 Bitcoins, worth around $72 million. This case has caught the attention of the international enforcement agencies and India was flagged about the development as well, police officials said. The Opposition has alleged that the Karnataka government withheld this information from the central agencies. “The hacker had hacked into three Bitcoin exchanges, 14 websites, including 10 poker websites, and exploited malware. The total of which is speculated to be around ₹2,283 crore but it is not disclosed. Why was this not informed to more competent authorities?” questioned Priyank Kharge, Congress legislator and former information technology minister. He went on to add that even though police claimed they had seized Bitcoins from the hacker, they were not produced before the court. “My questions are simple. Where are the Bitcoins seized from the hacker Sriki? Why was the mention of seized 31 Bitcoins of ₹9 crore left out of the charge sheet? Why was a hacker granted bail by police after claiming to have hacked government websites?” asked Kharge. Responding to the allegation, a senior Bengaluru police officer, who didn’t want to be named, said that although Srikrishna had told police about his involvement, it could not be corroborated. “Yes, in his voluntary statement (copy of which is available with HT), Sriki has claimed a lot of things including being part of the Bitfinex hacking. In his statement, he talks about Runscape.com, Bitcointalk.org etc. Bitfinex was one of those companies he mentioned. We were not able to verify this information, so it was not communicated. We were trying to get more evidence,” said the officer. He added that police could only find evidence of his involvement in the hacking of some poker companies and the government portal. Responding to allegations about the ‘missing Bitcoins’, the officer admitted the police department did announce the seizure of the ₹9 crore worth of Bitcoins from Srikrishna. “He had done an evidence collection in the presence of two experts, where Srikrishna showed a Bitcoin account with 31 Bitcoins in it. With the help of experts, he had changed the login details of the account and considered it as seized. However, several days later we realised the seized account didn’t belong to Sriki. We have submitted all these details before the court also. I don’t understand why there is a controversy over this,” said the officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/police-send-4-laptops-of-bitcoin-case-accused-for-forensic-scan-101636657181864.html
12-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi: In a first, compensation scheme in the works for electrical accidents||Victims of electrical accidents in the city may soon get compensation of up to ₹5 lakh from power utilities, with the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) issuing draft regulations on a reparation scheme for such cases on Thursday. DERC officials said that this is the first time that the city will have a mandatory compensation scheme in place.According to the draft regulations, placed in the public domain for a month for comments, the compensation payable for loss of human life or more than 60% disability as a result of an electrical accident will be ₹5,00,000 per person. The compensation will be ₹1,00,000 per person in case of disability between 40% and 60%. Further, subject to production of a government hospital bill, power utilities will need to pay ₹25,000 if a person requires hospitalisation for over a week, and ₹10,000 if the period less than a week. Officials said the compensation slab will become the norm in a month.The draft regulations come nearly five years after the Delhi high court in December 2016 ruled that power utilities have to compensate the kin of victims in electrocution cases if it was established that there were “lapses” on their part in maintaining prescribed safety measures. The petitioners had then alleged that discoms failed to observe strict compliance of public safety legislations, such as the Electricity Act 2003, which had led to loss of life due to electrocution.Explaining the process, the DERC stated that a person who is affected by the occurrence of an electrical accident can inform the generating companies or the discom and/or the electrical inspector of the area. The junior electrical engineer, assistant electrical engineer, executive engineer or their equivalent engineer will have to file a report on the incident and submit it to the higher ups. Once the case is cleared for compensation, the amount shall be paid to the persons entitled to receive the compensation within 15 days from the date of the final orders of the concerned authority.The draft rules also include compensation for loss of cattle or livestock due to electrocution -- ranging from ₹5,000 (sheep/goat/pig etc.) to ₹50,000 (buffalo/cow/camel/yak etc).For draught animals, such as camel, horse and bullock, the compensation will be ₹25,000, while it is ₹15,000 for donkey, pony or mule.For poultry, it will be ₹50 per bird, subject to a ceiling of assistance of ₹1,000 per beneficiary household.The commission clarified that the compensation scheme, which the generation companies or distribution companies (discoms) will be liable to pay on account of any wrongful act, omission, rashness, neglect or default, is irrespective of the insurance or any other scheme entitled to the victim.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiin-a-first-compensation-scheme-in-the-works-for-electrical-accidents-101636657180533.html
12-11-2021||Delhi||Plan for five-star hotel at Delhi's Pragati Maidan delayed||A five-star hotel that is due to be built at the revamped Pragati Maidan complex is likely to be delayed even further after a lukewarm response and “lack of interest” from the hospitality industry, said senior officials on Monday.LC Goyal, the chief managing director of the India Trade Promotion Organisation (ITPO), which manages Pragati Maidan, said the Covid-19 pandemic has left the industry more cautious.“The proposal request documents are ready, and we will wait for the opportune time to invite bids. It may be done in another six months or a maximum of 12 months. Right now, there is no appetite in the hospitality industry to put in money in the project,” Goyal said.He added that private companies currently prefer to invest in brownfield projects rather than green field projects.The union government approved in December 2019 a project to transfer of 3.7 acres of land at Pragati Maidan on a 99-year lease for ₹611 crore for a five-star hotel.The government also at the time said ITPO will redevelop the land into an international exhibition and convention centre and Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated four such exhibition halls under this project last month. These new halls will be utilized to host the 40th annual trade fair between from November 14-27.Goyal said he was hopeful that the market will improve in six months.“Even the existing capacity of hotels is currently not getting utilised optimally,” he said.“The hotel unit will be a completely private sector enterprise in which we will monetise the land. We have a clear proposal in which the land will be monetized and the cost will be paid by the private company over a period of time. They will be able to run the facility for 99 years. The model of providing land for 30-33 years would have run into many problems being witnessed in such models in last few years,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhifivestar-hotel-project-at-revamped-pragati-maidan-to-see-further-delays-101636656939848.html

12-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi saw uptick in crimes in 1st 10 months of this year||New Delhi: The number of crimes registered in the Capital in the first 10 months of this year rose nearly 17% compared to the same period last year, according to data released by the Delhi Police.The total number of crimes increased from 206,978 till October 31 last year to 241,550 in the comparative period this year. Almost all heinous crimes, such as robbery, snatching, attempt to murder, dacoity, crimes against women and vehicle thefts, saw a sharp increase.For example, there were 480 cases of attempted murder until October 31 last year, which increased to 640 during the same period this year.Robbery cases too increased from 1,606 to 1,829, and dacoity from 8 to 20 cases, in the comparative period. Robbery and dacoity cases are filed under different sections -- under the Indian Penal Code, a case of dacoity is filed when there are more than five persons involved in a robbery.Among the major robbery incidents reported in the Capital are a robbery at an ATM kiosk in south Delhi’s CR Park on October 29 where a security guard was assaulted and tied up before the thieves fled with the cash tray; and another in which a family was held hostage by four gunmen inside their house in Uttam Nagar on July 7.Snatching cases have also increased from 6,318 in 2020 to 7,504 this year. Snatching is one of the most common street crimes across the city, and is considered a gateway crime for bigger offences. Recently, a 22-year-old woman was injured when she fell off from a moving cycle rickshaw while trying to fight off two bike-borne men who tried to snatch her phone on a busy road in northeast Delhi’s Dilshad Garden on November 2. Less than week before this incident, two women and the driver of an autorickshaw they were travelling were injured when the vehicle overturned after two bikers attempted to snatch one of the passenger’s cellphone. A 22-year-old electrician was also stabbed to death in central Delhi’s west Patel Nagar by eight men during a snatching bid.Kidnapping for ransom cases increased from 10 to 15. Police registered 1,429 till October 31 last year, which increased to 1,725 cases in the same period this year.On August 1, the alleged rape and murder of a nine-year-old girl by a priest and his three accomplices had led to many citizens coming out on the streets to highlight how the national capital is still unsafe for women. Last week, a 23-year-old woman was left critically injured and fighting for her life after her 26-year-old neighbour allegedly tied up her up and threw acid on her at his home in outer Delhi’s Bawana on the eve of Diwali (November 3).The number of murder and rioting cases, however, decreased this year. Murder cases dropped from 393 until October 31 last year, to 379 this year. Also, in the same comparative period, rioting cases dropped from 688 last year to 58 this year.To be sure, the number of rioting and murders cases was high last year because of the northeast Delhi riots in February 2020 -- at least 53 people died and 775 rioting cases were registered in just northeast Delhi during the riots.A shocking crime that made national headlines in recent months was the murder of top gangster Jitender Gogi inside the Rohini court complex during a court hearing on September 24. He was shot dead by two gunmen who posed as lawyers to gain entry to the courtroom.Deputy commissioner of police Chinmoy Biswal, who is also the Delhi Police spokesperson, said, “The increase in cases does not necessarily mean that crime has increased. It rather shows that Delhi Police believes in free and fair registration of cases. We have launched a big crackdown on street crime. The large number of criminals police arrest every day is a result of the vision given to the police stations that criminals should be off the streets. Through several operations, police have an upper hand over the criminals||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/crimes-in-delhi-up-since-last-year-police-data-shows-101636656879945.html

12-11-2021||Mumbai||MSRTC strike: Transport corporation suffers losses worth ₹126 crore||The cash-strapped Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC), which is one of the largest transport corporations of India, has suffered losses worth ₹126.49 crore owing to the employees’ strike that has been going on for more than two weeks, officials from the transport body has said.As the transport corporation with strength of 96,000 employees is unable to operate buses in Maharashtra, the organisation is suffering a daily average loss between ₹10 crore and ₹25 crore, officials said. Between October 27 and November 10 – the period the employees have been on strike – MSRTC has suffered a loss of ₹111.49 crore. On Thursday alone, MSRTC suffered loss of ₹15 crore.The strike began on October 27, but was later called off. However, a few employees continued the stir, impacting bus operations in the state.“The losses are increasing daily. We are in constant touch with the employees and have requested them to return back to work,” said a senior MSRTC official. The unions called for a strike after salaries were delayed and the deaths of employees by suicide in the past one year. The unions have demanded an increase in salary, merger of MSRTC with Maharashtra government, increase in dearness and house rent allowances. Employees’ unions have been claiming that more than 30 employees have died by suicide owing to the financial crisis that has been caused due to the delay in receiving salaries. On Thursday, state transport minister Anil Parab met MSRTC officials and employee leaders. Parab said several employees want to return to work and they would be provided protection by the government.“I have met the officials and controllers of every division and will be meeting the director general of police. I ensure that complete protection will be provided to the employees who return back to work,” said Parab. Parab also said efforts are being made in order to resume bus operations soon in the entire state to ease commuters’ hassles.The state government on Monday had permitted private buses, school buses, contract carriage and goods carriage buses to ferry passengers owing to the ongoing strike by MSRTC employees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/msrtc-strike-transport-corporation-suffers-losses-worth-126-crore-101636656819952.html

HSVP officials said that 10 permanent shops, vends and temporary hutments constructed on the land were removed by the enforcement team with the help of Gurugram police personnel. Sandeep Lot, junior engineer, said that a demolition exercise was carried out on two plots. The enforcement team reached the first plot around 11.30am. On one 1.25 acre plot, violators had constructed five shops selling retail goods, fruits and vegetables and construction material, he said. “The team demolished these shops with the help of earthmoving machines and cleared the area. This land belongs to HSVP and it was being misused by encroachers,” he said. While five shops were demolished on the second plot too, some other shop owners had obtained a stay order from the court, and officials said that further action will be taken only after the matter is legally resolved. On Wednesday, the enforcement team cleared 1.5 acres of government land from encroachments in the same area. HSVP officials said that 150 tin shed hutments, 40 permanent rooms, 25 rooms for workers and six shops were demolished in the area. The encroachers were also warned that if these structures were constructed again then criminal cases would be registered against them. HSVP officials said that some anti-social elements were taking money from the violators and helping them encroach upon government land.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/encroachments-cleared-from-gurugram-s-dlf-phase-3-in-two-day-drive-101636656759838.html
12-11-2021||Lucknow||Young batter Muskan Malik gives Aligarh reason to smile||Cricketers as well as fans at the Hamza Cricket Academy near Jamalpur in Aligarh were surprised to see a seven-year-old Muskan Malik fielding and catching the ball so quickly in 2009, but today the batter makes her home district proud. Although the girl’s talent was exceptional, many thought it was just “fun”. For young Muskan, though, it was serious business.Twelve years since then, Muskan Malik, now 19, is among the top batters in her category in the country. With 360 runs, including three centuries at an average of 90.00 in just five matches so far, Muskan is among the top run-getters in the ongoing Women’s Senior One-Day Trophy.Captaining Uttar Pradesh for first time after doing well as skipper of the Under-19 side before the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic, Muskan Malik and Co would be playing against Odisha in the pre-quarterfinals in Bangalore on Saturday.“She has always taken cricket seriously. We supported her at every stage of her life,” said her younger brother and mentor Rashid Malik, who took her to the cricket ground for the first time. “Initially, I felt her love for cricket was just a pastime, but he was serious from the very first day and always impressed everyone with her batting and fielding on the ground,” he said.“It wasn’t easy for us to let a girl play cricket in Aligarh, but people soon realised Muskan’s talent. She is now the pride of Aligarh,” he added.In fact, Muskan Malik’s talent started getting attention after she moved to the Abdul Cricket Academy at the Maua Khera Ground under the guidance of one Masood. In her first season with the Under-19 squad at the age of 17, Muskan stroked 350 plus runs and went on scoring 250 plus runs in her first season with the senior side when the season abruptly ended due to Covid-19.The youngest in a family of four brothers and sisters, Muskan Malik always shows her prowess as a batter.“She was quite sure of getting a chance to showcase her talent at the Women’s IPL in Dubai the last time, but couldn’t get a chance to play. But she didn’t lose her confidence and kept reminding herself to make the cut the next time,” her brother said.“Now, I am part of my father’s dairy business. Only because of Muskan’s creditable show in the sport, we are being treated differently in the society. We all wish to see Muskan playing for India in future,” he said.Muskan’s coach Masood, who runs his academy at the Aligarh Cricket School, praised the cricketer’s talent.“From the very first day, she has been performing wonderfully and doesn’t mind facing male bowlers at the nets. She plays matches against male cricketers for our academy and enjoys her game,” said Masood, adding, “Muskan has been a great learner and adapts quite quickly.”“I see a great talent in her. I am sure that if she continues to score runs like this, she will have a chance to make it to the Indian side for the next year’s World Cup,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/young-batter-muskan-malik-gives-aligarh-reason-to-smile-101636656700097.html
12-11-2021||Dehradun||Wary of migrant voters from Delhi, BJP makes plans for 2022 Uttarakhand assembly polls||With only a few months left for the upcoming Uttarakhand assembly elections to be held in early 2022, the ruling BJP has got into election mode with its leaders expressing confidence that they would emerge victorious. But, their confidence seems to waver a bit when it comes to the ‘Delhi’ factor. The BJP on Wednesday, launched its mega voter outreach drive with the slogan ‘Ghar Ghar Bhajpa, Har Ghar Bhajpa’ but if party insiders are to be believed, the leadership fears that the slogan might fail to enter the homes of the migrants living in Delhi. Citing the potential threat for them in the upcoming elections, senior leaders of the BJP said that the migrants living in Delhi may cause a dent in their vote bank, especially in the hilly areas by talking about the free amenities they get in the national capital like water and electricity. This was also evident when a few days ago, party state president Madan Kaushik after attending the national executive committee meeting had said that “BJP is chalking out a special strategy for the migrants of Uttarakhand.” He however, didn’t name any specific state or Union Territory where the migrants probably lived and worked. “The party is very serious about the voters working and living in Delhi and the damage they might do upon returning to their villages during the polls in 2022,” said a senior leader on condition of anonymity. There are over 2.50 lakh migrants from Uttarakhand living in Delhi for their livelihood who come from the hill districts of Tehri Garhwal, Pauri Garhwal, Pithoragarh and Rudraprayag. “The figure is very significant...And the significance increases more with the fact that a majority of them are from the villages in the hilly areas of the state where a margin of a few hundred votes makes the difference between a win and loss,” said the leader. Citing the reason behind the perceived threat from the Delhi-based migrants, he stated that living in Delhi, they get free water and electricity being provided by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government. “And in hilly areas, availability of these services is very vital. During the election, when they will return to the villages to vote, they will talk about these facilities to fellow villagers. That will surely impact their thought before exercising their franchise and they will have the same expectations from the BJP government,” said the leader. “The party leadership is not ignorant about this factor...It is taking it seriously and as a result we are chalking out a strategy for the migrants to deal with the threat they will bring during the elections,” he said. The leader however, also expressed confidence that the party will manage various issues by January. “As of now, the political air is such that, it won’t be a cakewalk for the BJP this time. We too will also not contest the elections with overconfidence and are aware that we are in the danger zone. But having said that, we are confident to manage all the odds by mid-January when we will announce our final list of candidates and win the polls,” the leader said. With the BJP taking the Delhi-based migrants as the biggest threat to them in the elections, political analysts say that it is the “issue-based politics of AAP in Delhi which the BJP here is wary of”. Senior political commentator SMA Kazmi who has been following Uttarakhand politics for over two decades, said, “Over the last few years the way AAP has made governance a major issue during polls, it is now posing a threat to the BJP.” “The AAP government had promised free water and electricity along with improved health and education services which they have actually delivered on the ground. The migrants living there are witness to that. Its Uttarakhand unit is also promising the same here which is the main cause of worry for the ruling BJP,” said Kazmi. “The AAP’s politics on governance issues is worrying the BJP as it knows that it has the ability to nullify their communal politics in Uttarakhand. Among the total migrants in a village, even if a single one returns to his village from Delhi, he may influence 20 voters with his experience in Delhi. This is the reason; BJP is making a separate strategy for them,” he added. Another political analyst and professor of political science MM Semwal in Garhwal Central University in Srinagar, Pauri Garhwal, talking about the migrant threat to BJP said, “It is unlikely that a large number of migrants will return to their villages to vote as the elections are slated in the winter months of January or February.” AAP state spokesperson Naveen Pirshali said, “AAP has always focussed their politics on development issues unlike BJP. Those from Uttarakhand living in Delhi are witness to that. At the same time, they also know what the parties ruling in Uttarakhand have been doing. We are confident that the people of Uttarakhand will give us a chance to serve them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/wary-of-migrant-voters-from-delhi-bjp-makes-plans-for-2022-uttarakhand-assembly-polls-101636656639988.html
12-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi HC asks forest conservator to decide if 60-year-old pipal needs to be cut||The Delhi high court on Thursday asked the deputy conservator of forests (DCF) to examine the condition of a 60-year-old pipal tree in Inderpuri area, while remarking that prima facie, the tree did not show any tilt or damage that it should be cut.“The photographs annexed… prima facie shows that there was no danger of the tree falling down as there is no tilt or sagging of the tree in the photograph. Be that as it may, it is an admitted position that the adjoining building has been constructed and the basement has been fixed up. Prima facie there is no danger of the tree falling down,” the court said.On the last date, the court had stayed the felling of the tree on an urgent mentioning by senior advocate N Hari Haran who contended that the 60-year-old tree in his locality was being cut by the authoritiesJustice Sanjeev Sachdeva on Thursday perused the photographs of the tree also pulled up the DCF for giving permission for the transplanting of the pipal tree. It asked the DCF to ascertain whether the tree is dangerous enough that it should be felled or transplanted.“What was the requirement to even transplant the tree?”, he said when the counsel for North Delhi Municipal Corporation (NrDMC) told the court that the tree was to be removed on account of the adjoining constructions.Appearing for the Delhi government, its additional standing counsel Gautam Narayan told the court that the civic body had sought permission to transplant the tree as it had become “dangerous” on account of digging work around it. He said the permission was granted for a limited period only and it expired on November 4.The counsel for the civic body said due to the construction of a nearby building, the entire basement was dug up and hence the tree was to be transplanted.However, the court said the current photographs showed that the building has already been constructed and there was no need, as such, to shift the tree. It also raised questions as to how such a full grown tree could be removed and taken elsewhere without damaging its roots.Sachdeva asked the authorities to file a report after examining the condition of the tree and posted the matter for further hearing to November 18.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hc-asks-forest-conservator-to-decide-if-60-year-old-pipal-needs-to-be-cut-101636656579914.html
12-11-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram authority likely to penalise those encroaching on green belts||The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) is working on a plan to impose penalties on those encroaching on green belts in the city, said officials on Thursday.Under the GMDA norms, no action can be taken against those encroaching on green belts at present.“If someone encroaches on a green belt in any part of the city, we can only remove those through anti-encroachment drives, or if someone destroys a fence or cuts a tree, we can contact the forest department. But the GMDA does not have any provision to take action against anyone... Such a provision is much needed because we cannot keep developing these places again and again. We are preparing a proposal, which will be sent to the senior authorities for approval,” said Subhash Yadav, head of the urban environment division of GMDA.The official, however, did not give any particular timeline about when the proposal is likely to be tabled.Last month, the GMDA had removed encroachments from a 1.5-km-long green belt near Guru Dronacharya Metro Station. Nearly seven restaurants, nurseries, and a few concrete structures were removed from that area.The GMDA has also decided to develop around 300 kilometres of green belts across Gurugram this year, and plant different species of plants there over the next three years, to increase green spaces in the city.The authority is developing these green belts by planting one particular species of trees on a single stretch, so that every road can be identified with that particular tree. It is also installing fences along the green belts in the city, so that the plants are not destroyed, and are protected from encroachment.The authority has prepared an action plan for the project, which will focus on covering 100 kilometres for this financial year. Officials said that initial works like fencing, digging of soil, and putting in fertilisers among others have started at certain stretches.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-authority-likely-to-penalise-those-encroaching-on-green-belts-101636656339914.html
12-11-2021||Delhi||Stalker held for attacking Delhi woman, had assaulted her earlier this year||A 21-year-old man has been arrested for allegedly stalking his 30-year-old woman neighbour and attacking her with a shaving blade with an intent to kill, in north Delhi’s Timarpur on Tuesday. After attacking her with the blade, he allegedly fled with her cellphone so that she could not inform the police about his crime, senior police officers said on Thursday.The man, who was arrested on Wednesday, was allegedly angry with the woman as for the past few months, she was ignoring his requests to continue their “friendship”. He had allegedly assaulted her in April as well but the woman had not filed any complaint at that time, deputy commissioner of police (north) Sagar Singh Kalsi said.Kalsi said the woman was returning home after dropping her two children to a private tuition centre in an area falling under the jurisdiction of Timarpur police station.A man named Sushil alias Ponta, who lives in the woman’s neighbourhood and had cordial relations with her family, met her on the way. He stopped her and forcibly asked her to sit on his motorcycle, said the DCP, quoting the woman’s statement.“The woman told us that since Sushil had been stalking her since long and had also injured her in April, she did not resist this time and accompanied him out of fear. Sushil took her to a secluded place and slashed her neck with the shaving blade. As she screamed for help, some passersby rushed to her aid while Sushil snatched her cellphone and fled,” said Kalsi.The woman was taken to a nearby hospital, where she was administered medical attention. After her condition was deemed stable, the police recorded her statement in which she identified her attacker and alleged that he had been threatening and stalking her for the past few months.Accordingly, a case of attempt to murder, theft, stalking and criminal intimidation was registered under Indian Penal Code’s Sections 307, 379, 354D and 506.Several teams were formed and tasked to nab the suspect. Through local intelligence and technical investigation, investigators located Sushil’s hideout in Timarpur and arrested him on Wednesday. The shaving blade and the bike that he used in the crime were recovered along with the woman’s phone.“Sushil told us that he was angry because the woman had been ignoring him. In April 2021, he had attacked her with a blade but that made no difference to her approach towards him. Her constant refusal for continue their friendship made him desperate and out of frustration, he assaulted her again on Tuesday with an intent to kill her,” said an investigator.This is the second incident to be reported in the capital within a week. On November 3, a 23-year-old was left critically injured and fighting for her life after her 26-year-old neighbour allegedly tied her up and threw acid on her at his house in outer Delhi’s Bawana. Police said the suspect, identified as Montu, was allegedly stalking her and pestering her for marriage, even though she was already married and living with her husband. He fled to his home town in Bihar’s Buxar after assaulting the woman and he was arrested on November 6. Montu disclosed that he had planned to shoot dead the woman, if her husband proved a hurdle between them.Delhi Police statistics show that the city has witnessed a 21% increase in cases of rape and molestation till October 31 this year when compared to last year’s figures during the same period.A total of 1,725 cases of rape and 2,157 molestations were reported between January 1 and October 31 this year, while in 2020, 1,429 rape and 1,791 molestation cases were registered during the same period, the police data shows.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiman-held-for-stalking-woman-slashing-neck-with-shaving-blade-101636656282321.html
12-11-2021||Noida||Lawyers abstain from work, demand high court bench in West Uttar Pradesh||The lawyers of Surajpur district court and other neighbouring district courts on Thursday abstained from work, demanding the formation of an Allahabad high court (HC) bench in western Uttar Pradesh. This has been a long-standing demand since 1978, they said.Manoj Bhati, president of district bar association, Surajpur, said that the lawyers of Uttar Pradesh West formed a committee -- Kendriya Sangharsh Samiti -- to spearhead a campaign for the formation of a high court bench in western part of the state. “The committee decided on Thursday that the lawyers should abstain from work in protest. Accordingly, we did not work on Thursday and submitted a memorandum to the district administration over the issue,” Bhati said.Mahavir Singh Tyagi, chairman of the committee, said that Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath visited Meerut on Thursday where a three-member delegation of lawyers met him and briefed him about their demands. “The chief minister has assured us that the matter will be considered. Lawyers from different districts of western Uttar Pradesh abstained from work on Thursday, and they are planning to visit Noida to put their demands before the chief minister during his visit to Gautam Budh Nagar on November 25 this year for the foundation ceremony of the Jewar airport, yet again,” Tyagi said.At present, the Allahabad high court has a bench in Lucknow, which caters to 12 neighbouring districts. Western Uttar Pradesh comprises of 22 districts -- Gautam Budh Nagar, Ghaziabad, Meerut, Bulandshahr, Hapur, Baghpat, Aligarh, Hathras, Agra, Mathura, Firozabad, Bareilly, Badaun, Pilibhit, Saharanpur, Muzaffarpur, Shamli, Moradabad, Bijnor, Rampur, Amroha and Sambhal.Tyagi also said that, at present, people from these districts need to visit Allahabad for any work at the high court. “Even for an affidavit -- which can be made here for ₹200 -- people have to spend ₹7,000. The expenses incurred in travelling to Allahabad, staying in guest houses, paying lawyer’s fee, among others. In case of fighting a legal case, people’s struggle gets prolonged,” he added.Tyagi said that there is no specific district for the bench in western Uttar Pradesh. “The government can make the bench in any district in West Uttar Pradesh,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/lawyers-abstain-from-work-demand-high-court-bench-in-west-uttar-pradesh-101636656281278.html

The suspect Rohit lives in the same village and threatened the victim with dire consequences if she spurned his advances, they said. He was also forcing her to withdraw the police complaint against him.The teenager lives with her family in Sainthali village, said police.“Rohit has been harassing me for the past two years. He used to stop me in the middle of the road, and give me his cellphone number to contact him. He also threatened to harm me for refusing his advances,” the student said in her complaint.“My daughter studied at home and completed her Class X over this issue. When my daughter informed us that she was harassed, my wife and my mother visited the suspect’s house and complained about this to his family members. The suspect’s family, however, said that he does not listen to them and they are helpless in this case,” said the father.The victim’s father said that the suspect had sent a 10-year-old child to their house last week and asked his daughter to meet him outside. “My daughter had refused to meet him. However, later he intercepted my daughter in the middle of the road and threatened to shoot her,” he said.The victim’s father also said that as the teenager is preparing for recruitment in the Army, she goes for a run in the morning and evening in the neighbourhood every day. “But because of Rohit she is unable to continue with her running practice,” the father added.A case has been registered against the suspect under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 354 (assault of criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) and 506 (criminal intimidation) at the Jarcha police station on Wednesday, said the station house officer (SHO), Shripal Singh. “We have launched a search for the suspect who is still on the run,” Singh said.Vrinda Shukla, deputy commissioner of police (women safety), said, “There is zero tolerance to such cases...

12-11-2021||Noida||Gautam Budh Nagar authorities to hold employment workshop for farmers’ children||The industrial bodies of Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway have decided to organise a two-day workshop on November 13 and 14th at Noida’s Shilp Haat in Sector 33 A from 10am to 5pm to employ youths looking for jobs in multinational companies. The move comes after farmers, who have given their land for development, demanded employment opportunities for their children in industry bodies and private companies. Since September 1, farmers from around 80 villages in Noida have been protesting against the government at the community centre in Harola village near Noida authority office in Sector 6 demanding better jobs for their children. Even after many rounds of discussions with the top officials of the Noida authority, farmers refused to end their agitation. They have also been disrupting work at the construction sites of the developers and the government projects stating that they will not let the works progress until the authority addressed their demands. Similarly, farmers in Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway are also protesting against the industrial bodies, demanding better compensation for their land and jobs for their children. As a result, all the three authorities are organising the employment workshop so that farmers’ children get jobs as per their qualification. “The applicants can come and submit their documents at the workshop. The staff at the workshop will process applications and help eligible candidates get jobs,” said Ritu Maheshwari, CEO of Noida authority. The authority has requested all the farmers to make the most of the workshop and help their children get jobs. “They candidates should come along with relevant qualification documents so that their applications with regard to the job can be processed and the respective company can hire as per vacancies,” said another Noida authority official. There are around 300 villages in Gautam Budh Nagar, in which Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway industrial bodies are located. In 1976, these three authorities took over agricultural land from farmers for development of urban and industrial areas. Farmers have been demanding reservation in private jobs for a long time but the authorities did not accept this demand. “We can employ a person only if he or she is qualified for a job and we have a vacancy. We will support the move of the authority so that we can give back to farmers, who gave their land for the development of these three industrial cities,” said Vipin Malhan, president of Noida Entrepreneur Association. Farmers also have welcomed the move. “We hope the workshop helps the youth in village. The authorities should organise such workshops regularly,” said Subash Singh, a farmer leader from Nagli Wazidpur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gautam-budh-nagar-authorities-to-hold-employment-workshop-for-farmers-children-101636656101397.html
12-11-2021||Delhi||Govt reply sought on colour-coding of consumer products||The Delhi high court on Thursday sought the Centre’s response on a plea that products -- not just food items -- should be tagged as vegetarian or non-vegetarian on the basis of their ingredients and on the bases of the items used in their manufacturing processes.The petition, filed by the Ram Gau Raksha Dal trust, contended that it is the Fundamental Right of citizens to know whether or not the food they consume, cosmetics they use, and clothes that they wear, either contain or are manufactured by using components or parts derived from the body of an animal.The plea sought to formulate appropriate guidelines and policies for the strict implementation of the existing rules to mandate manufacturers to label their products.A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh, while hearing the matter, said: “There can be no denying the fact that every person has the right to know, which springs from the Right to Freedom of Speech under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. The issues raised herein have a bearing on Right to Life preserved under Article 21 in as much as a person is entitled to profess and follow his beliefs, which is also protected under Article 25 of the Constitution. We, therefore, direct the respondent authorities to seriously examine the issues and respond to the petition within three weeks.”The court said that the order should be communicated to the ministry of consumer affairs and the health ministry. It has also sought to set up an expert committee to examine the feasibility of labelling all consumer items and products as “vegetarian” and “non-vegetarian”.To be sure, packaged food items are tagged with red (non vegetarian) and green (vegetarian) tags based on ingredients, as per to Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodity) Rules issued in 2011.During the hearing, the additional solicitor general (ASG) Chetan Sharma, supported the petition, and said that the petitioner has raised a very important issue. He sought time to file his response.The Centre’s standing counsel Ajay Digpaul accepted notice on behalf of the ministries.The matter will now be heard on December 9.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hc-seeks-centre-reply-on-colour-coding-of-consumer-products-101636656039887.html
12-11-2021||Lucknow||Now Allahabad University to set up museum to showcase life, contributions of its stalwarts||With the aim of discouraging the migration of meritorious students to other cities of the country for pursuing higher education, Allahabad University (AU) officials have decided to establish a museum which would showcase the stalwarts produced by the university, to future students, so that they are encouraged to pursue their studies here at the fourth oldest university of the country. “It pains me to see that many of the young students of the city and neighbouring districts are not at all aware of the ‘glorious past’ of AU or for that matter who all were the great personalities of the country who have been the students and teachers of this great institution,” said AU vice-chancellor Prof Sangita Srivastava. While we are making all efforts to provide the best of the facilities, both in terms of academics and sports to our students, at the same time they should feel ‘self-pride’ while studying at AU and this would come only when they are well-informed about the glorious past that this university has and what great personalities AU has produced, she added. The VC further said, “For making the students, both who are already enrolled on the campus and also those who would become part of AU in coming years, more aware regarding the glorious past of AU and all the world-renowned personalities that AU had produced, this museum has been conceptualized,” said the VC. Stalwarts of AU, ranging from former President of India Shankar Dayal Sharma to former Prime Ministers Chandra Shekhar and VP Singh and the former five-time Prime Minister of Nepal Surya Bahadur Thapa besides noted poets and writers like Firaq Gorakhpuri and Harivansh Rai Bachchan as well as scientists like noted astrophysicist Meghnad Saha among others, would be part of the proposed museum. The museum would be established at one of the halls of the building near the historical Vizayanagram Hall of the science faculty campus of the central varsity. Although the museum would have busts or murals of these stalwarts would be decided in due course of time as AU is yet to rope in funds too for this proposed museum. “We would have to arrange for the needed funds too for establishing the said museum. The funds could come from business houses and companies through corporate social responsibility (CSR),” said Prof Srivastava.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/now-allahabad-university-to-set-up-museum-to-showcase-life-contributions-of-its-stalwarts-101636655919930.html
12-11-2021||Pune||PMC works valued at ₹1 crore carried out with no tender: civic chief to file police complaint||PUNE The Pune municipal corporation (PMC), acting on instructions from municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar, will file a police case alleging that civic work valued at ₹1 crore was carried out without any tender issued for the same.Vikram Kumar said, “This is an economic offence we have moved to file an application with the police. I have spoken with the police commissioner asked him to file the complaint.”The matter came to light after the PMC’s audit department revealed that during the Covid-19 pandemic, the electrical department carried out wiring-related work at the Vaikunth and Amardham crematoriums, without tenders being issued for the same. Following the audit, the municipal commissioner ordered a probe and asked the municipal administrator to file a first information report (FIR) with the police in this matter. Meanwhile, the electrical department has also issued notices to all parties involved with the work.Last week, it was found that the Singhhad ward office also carried out work without issuing a tender. There is also the allegation that in some instances, while a tender was issued for work at one site, the actual work was carried out elsewhere.The municipal commissioner has also asked the administration to conduct a detail inquiry into the matter and take necessary action against the guilty. This is not the first time this has happened in the PMC.A few years ago, in the Bhavani Peth area, a contractor had dug the holes with no pipelines laid. Despite this, the PMC at the time, paid the contractor for the pipelines. Then in Katraj, two tenders were issued for the same road work and bills were issued twice for same job.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-works-valued-at-rs-1-crore-carried-out-with-no-tender-civic-chief-to-file-police-complaint-101636655441542.html
12-11-2021||Noida||Agencies told to curb PM10 level as Ghaziabad air continues to be foul||Ghaziabad continued to hold its record of being the most polluted city across the country on Thursday, with the air quality index (AQI) bulletin released by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) showing that the city recorded an AQI of 461, again in ‘severe’ category. The CPCB index also showed that the air quality of Greater Noida and Noida was also ‘severe’ with an AQI recording of 417 and 434 respectively. An air quality index (AQI) between zero and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’. With ‘severe’ air quality for eight consecutive days since Diwali, that was observed on November 4, Ghaziabad equalled its previous record of being in the ‘severe’ zone for eight days from November 9 to 16 in 2017. Noida too has had seven days of ‘severe’ air since Diwali, barring Wednesday (November 10) when its pollution levels marginally improved and the AQI reached the ‘very poor’ category.Ever since measures listed under the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) came into effect on October 16, Ghaziabad has been most polluted in the country on seven days-- October 16, 29, November 1, 2, 6, 10 and 11. On the other hand, Noida was polluted for only one day on November 5. As the pollution levels continued to remain in the “severe” category for the eighth consecutive day, the district administration on Thursday asked different agencies to intensify efforts to control PM10 levels. Particulate matter is the general term for inhalable particles in the air such as aerosols, smoke, fumes, dust, ash and pollen. Various studies have found that exposure to fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 and PM10) has been associated with hospital admissions and several serious health effects, including premature death.“Following the spike in pollution levels, the district administration held a meeting with different agencies and asked them to intensify mechanised road sweeping and water sprinkling, especially in the pollution hotspots. Agencies, such as the municipal corporation and the Ghaziabad Development Authority, have been asked to intensify action against construction sites violating norms,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UP Pollution Control Board (UPPCB). “The district magistrate has asked agencies to at least control PM10 levels, even though PM2.5 is also high, due to external factors like stubble burning,” said Sharma. In this connection, the state pollution control board on Thursday levied a penalty of ₹25 lakh against Ghaziabad municipal corporation for not taking dust control measures in Sahibabad Site IV Industrial Area. The industrial area is one of the hot spots identified under the city’s ‘winter action plan’ and also figures in the list of hot spots identified by the CPCB last year. “A penalty of ₹25 lakh has been levied as the corporation is not taking up water sprinkling and dust mitigation measures in the industrial area. Further, we have also recommended a fine of ₹50 lakh against a ready mix plant of a private company. The plant was found not taking measures to control dust,” said Sharma. Officials of the municipal corporation said they are taking up dust control measures in the industrial area. “We have a facility of water sprinkling and we are also using anti-smog guns. We will take legal recourse against the penalty levied against us by the UPPCB,” said municipal commissioner MS Tanwar. On November 9, the UPPCB levied a cost of ₹25 lakh against the UP Jal Nigam for not taking up dust control measures at the CISF Road in Indirapuram and granted liberty to the agency to recover the cost from contractor. Environmentalists said the pollution has worsened in the past few years, despite agencies making claims of better pollution abatement measures. “The rise in pollution levels is unprecedented as the city continues to reel under the ‘severe’ category for over a week. The PM2.5 levels can be controlled if there is a check on traffic snarls and residents are encouraged to use public transport. However, state run public transport system is still not there in the city,” said Akash Vashishtha, an environmentalist from Ghaziabad. The forecast by the System of air quality and weather forecasting and research (Safar) said on Thursday that there was no change in wind direction, which is currently flowing in the north-west direction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/agencies-told-to-curb-pm10-level-as-ghaziabad-air-continues-to-be-foul-101636655439907.html
12-11-2021||Delhi||Delhi Bar employee found dead in Tis Hazari court; police say no foul play||A junior employee of the Delhi Bar Association was found dead inside the Tis Hazari court complex on Thursday morning, with investigators saying that they haven’t found anything pointing towards foul play in the 32-year-old’s death.His colleagues told police that the deceased, a resident of Shahadra, contracted tuberculosis and reportedly told his friends that he was feeling unwell on Wednesday afternoon.Deputy commissioner of police (north) Sagar Singh Kalsi said, “He was unwell and had tuberculosis. His friends said that he drank regularly and heavily... Prima facie, it does not look like there is foul play behind his death. There are no external injuries. We are awaiting the post-mortem report.”Police said the chamber was not ransacked and his belongings, such as cell phone and wallet, were intact. There were some blood stains on the dustbin in the room but police suspect that it may be due to the man vomitting inside the room before his death. The deceased, who also cleaned the lawyers’ chamber at the court complex in the morning, often spent the nights at chambers of different advocates within the court complex.Advocate Sanjeev Nasair, president of the Delhi Bar Association, confirmed that the man was a junior employee of the association for over six years, and said that he had been on sick leave for many months. “Officially, he was still on leave. The information we have is he had come to meet someone at the court yesterday. He requested the staff to allow him to sleep in one of the chambers. This is fairly common. Employees work there and stay the night. They help lawyers with the paper work. He had again fallen ill some days ago. It does not look like a murder.”The incident came to light on Thursday morning, when a court staff reached chamber 192 of the eastern wing inside Tis Hazari and found him lying unconscious inside the chamber.On Thursday, as soon as the police control room received information about a man’s body found in one of the chambers of the Tis Hazari complex, senior Delhi police officers visited the spot as a crime team collected forensic evidence.Police are yet to register a case and are awaiting the post-mortem report before proceeding with the investigation. The body has been kept at the Sabzi Mandi mortuary.The courts in the city have been on high alert since the murder of gangster Jitender Maan, alias Gogi, inside the Rohini court complex nearly two months ago. Gogi was shot dead by gunmen on September 24 during a court hearing. The two gunmen had posed as lawyers to gain entry to the court and fired at least 18 bullets, killing Gogi on the spot.After the incident, Delhi police conducted a security audit and handed the court’s security to its security wing, a specialised unit within the force that deals only with security matters. Before the incident, the security of the seven lower courts in Delhi was handled by the local police personnel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-bar-employee-found-dead-in-tis-hazari-court-police-say-no-foul-play-101636655379810.html
12-11-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai coastline crisis: How to save a city: Treat its waste well||Stopping his car a few metres from the Guzdhar Bandh in Santacruz (west), activist Zoru Bathena talks about how the structure was built in the early 1900s to prevent the sea from entering the city. To get to it, we must cross the slum built next to the outlet of the estuary, and piles of garbage. Finally, a large nullah that drains out into the sea comes into view. “This is a storm water drain,” Bathena said, emphasising that a nullah in Mumbai is another term for a storm water drain and not a sewage pipeline. This one is lined with all kinds of garbage, and sewage water flows into it from the houses on its flanks. Bathena pointed to the sluice gates, further down where the nullah drains into the sea, that clap down when the tide is high and when the intensity of rain during the monsoon increases. The sluice gates are supposed to help save the area from flooding. A water treatment plant adjacent to the gates has floating booms that form a barrier and intercept debris and trash preventing them from entering the sea. Of course, when the sluice gates open, the water from the nullah flows out freely. There are no nets here to catch the plastic, because in theory, storm water drains should not be carrying any plastic at all. And this is where the city’s sewage problem lies. Sewage pipes are meant to carry the wastewater from buildings and connect these to a larger network. In Mumbai, all sewage pipes are connected to one of eight sewage treatment plants (STPs). A storm water drain, however, collects run-off water from the streets during rains and drains it into the sea. The storm water drainage system of the city, in fact, comprises a hierarchal network of roadside surface drains, underground drains, and laterals, major and minor nullahs and outfalls which discharge all the surface run-off into the rivers (Mithi, Dahisar, Poisar and Oshiwara and their tributaries) and the Arabian sea.A warren of pipelinesMumbai’s sewage network has had a patchy evolution over the history of the city’s urban development, said historian Shekhar Krishnan, who is an advisor to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) heritage conservation cell. “Up until the start of the 20th century, there was never any adequate sewage disposal system. What existed was skewed towards the rich and elite areas. It was also built to cater to the industrial areas where cotton mills had a good sewage system because the textile industry was water intensive. In fact, Mahatma Gandhi too had commented upon Mumbai’s poor sanitation system during his first visit to the city,” he said. It was in the 1920s, when the flushing technology was added to toilets, increasing water to sewage pipelines that Mumbai had to upgrade its system. This was also improved upon when local self-governance took charge of civic infrastructure in the same decade. Even so, development has only followed population expansion, and our sewage system is constantly playing catch-up. When a storm water drain carries sewage, plastic and other chemical pollutants from human activity, it chokes the life in the water bodies it drains into. “Untreated sewage reduces oxygen in the creeks. It’s a gas chamber for the organisms in the water bodies. The only reason sardines and Bombay duck can still be seen in our waters in because their tolerance to sewage is high. Treating sewage involves aerating it with chemicals and adding natural enzymes to this to breathe life into the sewage,” said Stalin D, the director of Mumbai-based non-profit Vanashakti. As things stand now, the total area under the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) is 454.40 km sq out of which 322.81 km sq falls under what is demarcated as the Development Zone, while the remaining 131.59 km sq comes under what is called the non-development zone, which comprises forests, mangroves, salt pans etc, where no regular development is permitted.Since 2016, the corporation has been expanding the sewerage network. But the problem of raw sewage entering the sea remains.Treating our waste In October 2020, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) ordered the BMC to pay ₹34 crore as environmental compensation for discharging raw sewage into city drains following Vanashakti’s 2017 public interest litigation (PIL). Following the order, the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) drew up a set of compliances that the BMC was required to put into effect from January 1, 2021. The MPCB carried out an audit between December 2020 and June 2021, which revealed that none of the compliances had been adhered to. “The BMC has plans to upgrade their existing STPs [Sewage Treatment Plants], and one new STP will be installed at Dharavi. At present, tendering process for modification and expansion of the existing and new STPs are completed. It will take four to five years for completion of these STPs,” the BMC submitted in a written response to MPCB. Speaking to Hindustan Times at the time, Atul Rao, chief engineer, BMC had attributed the delay to the Covid-19 pandemic. Currently, Mumbai has eight STPs, and the BMC is upgrading them to increase the quantum of sewage that they can treat, but the deadlines are at least five years away. Apart from this, the BMC also plans to build 19 STPs for the four river rejuvenation projects, which includes one that can treat up to 418 Mega Litres (one million) per Day (MLD) in Dharavi. Even so, this isn’t going to be enough.According to data made available by the MCGM to a Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) progress report, the eight treatment plants service 322.81 km sq — which covers the area of the city’s seven sewerage zones — but the accompanying sewerage network is only 269.39 km sq. Simply put, the existing network only covers 83.5% of the area it should service, with most of the shortfall (53.43 km sq) in areas like Malad, Charkop and Ghatkopar. Work on 6.89 km sq of unserviced sewerage area has been ongoing since 2016 (in Colaba and Worli, the existing sewer network of 230mm / 450mm/600 mm diametres is also being upsized to 800mm /1200mm) and it is expected to be completed by 2024.“For the remaining unsewered area (44.06 km sq) (…) and also to prevent discharge of untreated sewage/dry weather flow from storm water drain/nallas directly into water bodies (rivers/creeks/sea) which causes water pollution, MCGM has undertaken major projects which include either diversion of dry weather flow (DWF) to MCGM sewerage system or by providing on-site treatment through decentralized STPs under various package works of Mithi River and other rivers rejuvenation project. MCGM has various proposals of installing various sewerage network/tunnel,” the report stated. A problem of volumeLet’s reassess. A little over 68% of the population in Greater Mumbai has access to a sewerage network. One of the reasons why the rest of the population doesn’t have access could be attributed to a rule that buildings need an occupation certificate before being allowed access to the sewage pipe. This rule immediately excludes the city’s slums. “Buildings that don’t have a connection link their sewage outflow to the storm water drains instead, illegally,” Bathena said. A starting point, said Himanshu Thakkar, coordinator for South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People (SANDRP), would be to conduct surveys at the ward level to understand how much sewage is being generated, what is the capacity of the current system. Treatment plants are advisable not just at the ward level but also within each building complex. In fact, it’s a rule in Mumbai according to an urban development department resolution. “If buildings treat the sewage sufficiently, it would allow for this water to be used locally, for gardening, washing cars or even floor. If treated very well, the water can be used to recharge ground water and local water bodies,” Thakkar said. According to P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner of BMC, “The long term plan is to have localised mini STP’s in the city with the help of our river rejuvenation plans. By this plan say we aim to have 15-20 mini STPs that will handle the problem in a localised manner. But the eight STPs are in a strategic location, and they should solve the problem.” Velrasu said that another major factor that would ease the city’s sewage problem is to turn informal housing into formal housing. “This will help the city in solving its problem related to sewage in the city.”Anuradha Parmar, executive director of the Urban Design Research Institute, provided a bird’s eye view of the issue. The problem, she said, is that often there is inadequate coordination between waste segregation and collection, transportation, and disposal. “The governing body needs to have an eye on the larger picture and ensure these processes don’t work is silos. If we take the issue of slums, while there might be well intentioned CSR projects that build toilets there, their monitoring and impact is often incomplete. Details of how they fit into the larger sewage network and if the trunk has the capacity to handle this inflow is often overlooked,” she said. P. Velrasu , Additional municipal commissioner (Projects)“The long term plan is to have localised mini Sewage Treatment Plants in the city with the help of our river rejuvenation plans. By this plan say we aim to have 15-20 mini STPs at a localised level that will handle the problem in a more localised manner. But the eight STPs are in a strategic location and they should solve the problem. ” With inputs from Mehul Thakkar and Prayag Arora-Desai||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/how-to-save-a-city-treat-its-waste-well-101636654964231.html
12-11-2021||Delhi||Farm fires may pick up soon, experts say||After a slow start to the stubble burning season, largely due to a late withdrawal of the south-west monsoon and on and off showers till the end of October, farm fires events in states neighbouring Delhi are picking up only post-Diwali and with the next crop season fast approaching, environmentalists and weather experts have warned that the fire count could rise fast in the coming days.Experts also cautioned that a smaller window will not necessarily mean fewer fires; in fact, this year’s cumulative fire count could match or even surpass the figures of the past years, an estimation that does not bode well for Delhi, where air quality is already oscillating between severe and very poor since Diwali (November 4).An analysis of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa)’s NRT VIIRS satellite data by think-tank Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) shows the fire count from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh has touched 64,299 between October 1 and November 10 — the third highest cumulative count after those recorded in 2020 and 2016.In 2020, 71,976 fires were recorded during the same period, while 93,076 fires were recorded during the same period in 2016. Experts say if the present trend continues, this year’s tally could match or even surpass the count of last year.CEEW analysis also showed while Punjab has so far recorded 54,834 fires between October 1 and November 10 — the third highest count after those recorded in 2020 (64,958) and 2016 (77,108) — Haryana, where farm fires have shown a declining trend over the past few years, has shown a spike in fires this year.So far, Haryana has recorded 7,197 farm fires, a spike of nearly 40% from last year’s count of 4,371 fires during the same period. In 2019, Haryana recorded 5,254 fires till November 10, while the figure was 6,252 in 2018. Haryana’s numbers were higher only in 2017 and 2016, when it recorded 8,310 and 10,070 fires, respectively.“Between September 1 and November 10, 55,076 and 7,237 farm fires were spotted in Punjab and Haryana, respectively. While the fires recorded so far are fewer when compared to the corresponding period last year, they were higher than those during the same period in 2018 and 2019. We have observed a considerable rise in the number of farm fires in November this year,” said LS Kurinji, programme associate, CEEW.She said while the number of farm fires collectively in Punjab and Haryana were only 20,723 till October 31, this figure has more than tripled, to 62,308 in the last 10 days, indicative of farmers stepping up the count as the crop season is fast approaching.“The slight shift observed in the farm fires trend this year can be attributed to the delayed harvest on account of a delayed monsoon withdrawal. The daily fire count has increased to a range of 3,000-6,000 fires over the past one week and with winds blowing predominantly from the north-west, the smoke from farm fires will move downwind and drive up the pollution levels in the national capital and surrounding areas. Taking cues from historical trends, we can expect a decrease in farm fires in the coming days as we approach the season’s end,” Kurinji said.Hiren Jethva, an aerosol remote sensing scientist at the Universities Space Research Association (USRA), the United States, said fires are at their steepest rise since October 25.“A backlog of stubble burning from October, due to wet and humid weather is likely to have shifted these cases to November, or there could be a systematic delay in the burning season altogether.”Pawan Gupta, a research scientist at the Goddard Earth Sciences Technology and Research (GESTAR), said that based on current trends, farm fires in Punjab could surpass last year’s fire count for the period in the next two or three days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/farm-fires-to-intensify-in-weeks-as-only-short-window-before-winter-sowing-101636654959860.html
12-11-2021||Delhi||‘Won’t act against pvt vendors for not paying license fee’: Delhi govt to HC||The state government on Thursday verbally assured the Delhi high court that it will not take any coercive action against retail liquor vendors for now for not paying the license fees under the New Excise Policy 2021.The court was hearing a plea seeking to postpone till November 17 the collection of licence fee as the petitioners, 16 retail liquor traders, claimed the government has not yet fixed maximum retail prices (MRPs) for liquor brands.Justice Rekha Palli, while hearing the plea challenging the decision of the state government to levy license fees from November 1, 2021, was informed by senior advocate Rahul Mehra that the government and liquor vendors are partners in business, and that the interest of all the stakeholders will be protected by not taking any precipitate action against anyone.Currently, there are 408 liquor vends run by the Delhi government in the city. As per the new excise policy, these will shut down on November 16 as new retail vends will open from November 17 in the Capital.Mehra said that a similar assurance has also been made before another bench of the high court hearing challenges related to excise policy. “...this is not at all adversarial. These are our business partners…and we want success as much as other stakeholders want it to be,” Mehra said.On the last date on Tuesday, the court had asked the government to specify the number of liquor brands for which the MRPs had been fixed.In response, Mehra gave a one-page note to the court on Thursday, mentioning that of the 30 major brands, MRPs of 10 have been fixed and the process for seven more will be complete in two days. He sought more time from the court to file a proper response, after which the court posted the matter for Monday.During the hearing on Thursday, the court expressed unhappiness with the government for filing another 31-page affidavit opposing the pleas by the retail license holders, pointing out that it had only made a limited query on the number of liquor brands for which MRPs have been fixed.In the affidavit, the government said retail vendors were trying to cover up their own delays and avoid payment of the license fee levied in accordance with the provisions of the Delhi Excise Act and rules and also the terms and conditions of the tender. Mehra said that the delay is also due to the fact that the wholesale sellers have not yet approached the government for fixing MRPs.However, senior advocate Maninder Singh, appearing for the petitioners, disputed the government’s stand and said that there was no delay on their part. He contended that brands were being registered till November 8 even as MRPs were not fixed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/no-coercive-action-against-liquor-vendors-for-licence-fee-delhi-govt-to-hc-101636654540247.html
12-11-2021||Chandigarh||Air quality of most Haryana cities fall under severe to poor categories||Air quality of most Haryana cities, especially those located in the national capital region, stood in severe to very poor category with the air quality index (AQI) of most cities measuring between 300 and 450.There is no major change in air quality in the past one week as it deteriorated on Diwali night.As per the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) bulletin on Thursday afternoon, three Haryana cities – Ballabgarh (431), Hisar (422) and Faridabad (412) – reported an AQI above 400 which is categorised as severe by the CPCB.The air quality of 12 other cities – Manesar (399), Charkhi Dadri (389), Bahadurgarh (385), Bhiwani (383), Gurgram (378), Jind (366), Panipat (365), Fatehabad (354), Kaithal (350), Rohtak (344), Dharuhera (334), and Kurukshetra (303) – were categorised as very poor with AQI measuring between 301 and 400.Having the AQI below 300, six cities of the state – Palwal (300), Ambala (299), Karnal (298), Sirsa (295), Narnaul (234), and Yamunanagar (220) – have best air quality in comparison to other cities of the state.Panchkula is the only city in Haryana mentioned in the bulletin which has satisfactory air quality with the AQI remaining below 100.Stubble burning cases reach near 5,000The incidents of crop residue burning are increasing with each passing day as the state has so far reported 4,937 incidents from September 15 to November 10, revealed the data of the Haryana Space Application Centre (HARSAC).Also, 184 incidents of stubble burning were reported on Wednesday. With 1,087 incidents, Kaithal reported most farm fires, followed by 981 in Fatehabad, 860 in Karnal, 520 in Kurukshetra, 528 in Jind, and 277 in Ambala; 86% (4,253 incidents) of total 4,937 were reported in these six districts.On why the authorities have failed to put a check on stubble burning, Karnal deputy director agriculture Aditya Dabas said the officials have been told to take strict action.He said 70 first information reports (FIRs) have been registered against the erring farmers and 443 farmers have been challaned in district. A fine of ₹11.22 lakh was imposed on them for burning the crop waste.Similarly, in Kaithal district, deputy director agriculture Karam Chand said five farmers have been booked and 476 farmers challaned. A fine of ₹8.92 lakh was imposed on farmers so far.However, no FIR was registered against the farmers in Kurukshetra, but the agriculture department has challaned 335 farmers of ₹7.22 lakh, the officials said.Tomar to review crop residue managementMeanwhile, Union agriculture and farmers welfare minister Narendra Tomar is scheduled to review the implementation of the crop residue management scheme in Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh on Friday via video conferencing.According to officials, the agenda of the meeting is to review the updated progress of implementation of the scheme and status of delivery of machines. Also, on agenda is to review the status of implementation of information, education and communication activities.The discussion on proposals of the states for inclusion of some additional machines under the scheme is also on agenda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/air-quality-of-most-haryana-cities-fall-under-severe-to-poor-categories-101636643846489.html
12-11-2021||Lucknow||Kasganj custodial death case: Victim’s father accuses cops of intimidation||The father of a 22-year-old man, who died in police custody in Uttar Pradesh’s Kasganj town, denied on Thursday that he had willingly affixed his thumbprint to a document saying his son was depressed and died by suicide. The 22-year-old, identified as Altaf, was called for interrogation at the Kasganj police station in an abduction case and died on Tuesday evening, with his family members alleging that he was killed by police personnel. But the police claimed that Altaf, who was accused of eloping with a minor Hindu girl, had strangulated himself using a string from his jacket hood in the washroom of the police lock-upLate in the evening, police produced a hand-written note that absolved the police of all blame in the case. The note, written in Hindi, said Altaf was depressed and had the thumbprint of his father, Chand Mian. Kasganj superintendent of police Rohan Pramod Botre also referred to the note to say that the family had no complaints with the police.But Mian said he was threatened by officials that his son’s body will not be handed over to him if he spoke against the police. “I did what I was told to do by the police,” he said.He said he was illiterate and couldn’t read what was written before placing his thumbprint. “I was neither in good health nor in a proper frame of mind when I gave the statement and placed my thumb impression without knowing the content on the paper. Being in an unstable condition, I did what I was asked by the police to do,” he said.Taken aback by Mian’s statements, the Kasganj police avoided comment on it. “Better ask father of deceased as to why he is changing his stand from one statement to another. What can police say about this?” stated ASP Kasganj, AK Singh.Altaf, a resident of Ahroli village of Kasganj district, worked as a tile fixer and was accused on November 8 of abduction and eloping with a minor Hindu girl by her family.A case was registered at the Sadar Kotwali police station of Kasganj under Sections 363 and 366 (kidnapping, abduction) of the Indian Penal Code against Altaf. Police said he was taken in for questioning on Tuesday morning while family said it was on Monday evening.“During interrogation, the accused went to the washroom at the police station, where he hanged himself to death from the tap,” said AK Singh, additional superintendent of police.“The accused was wearing a jacket with a hood and used its string which he tied to the tap in the toilet and hanged himself,” he added.Fatima, Altaf’s mother, appealed to the government for a fair probe.“There should be a Central Bureau of Investigation probe into the case as the suicide theory narrated by the police is baseless. In any case, how can a man commit suicide by hanging himself from a 3-ft-high tap. We do not trust the post-mortem report, which cites ‘hanging’ as the cause of death,” said Fatima. HT has a copy of the postmortem report which says there were no injury marks on the body and asphyxiation as the cause of death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/kasganj-custodial-death-case-deceased-s-father-cries-foul-over-letter-giving-clean-chit-to-cops-101636642587000.html
12-11-2021||Chandigarh||ED arrests former Punjab MLA Sukhpal Khaira in money laundering case||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Thursday arrested former Punjab MLA Sukhpal Singh Khaira in connection with a money laundering case being probed against him and others, officials said. He was produced in a PMLA court in Mohali and sent to ED custody for a day. The court asked the ED to produce him again on Friday.They said Khaira, 56, was taken into custody by the central probe agency in Chandigarh under provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The agency had raided his premises in March this year. The ED has alleged that Khaira is an “associate” of drug case convicts and fake passport racketeers. The politician has denied any wrongdoing and said he is being targeted by central agencies as he has been vocal against the Centre’s three new farm laws. “It is political vendetta. Nothing else,” said Khaira to media while being taken away by ED from their office in sector 18, Chandigarh. He had recently resigned from the state assembly. Khaira won the assembly election in 2017 from the Bholath assembly seat in Kapurthala district on an Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) ticket. He resigned from the primary membership of the Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP in January 2019 and floated his own outfit, the Punjab Ekta Party. He then re-joined the Congress in June this year. After the arrest, Khaira was taken to the Government Multi-Speciality Hospital, Sector 16, Chandigarh, for the medical examination. Later in the evening, he was produced before the duty magistrate in the special PMLA court in Mohali (Punjab).

12-11-2021||Jaipur||Congress high command to decide on state Cabinet reshuffle: Ashok Gehlot||Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Thursday said he has left the decision on the much awaited Cabinet reshuffle in the state to the Congress’ central leadership, which will decide when will it happen.The statement came a day after Gehlot met Congress leaders Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Ajay Maken, who is also the party’s Rajasthan in-charge, and KC Venugopal. Gehlot on Thursday met Congress chief Sonia Gandhi.“The high command will decide when the Cabinet expansion will happen. I have briefed (the high command). Ajay Maken... keeps coming to Rajasthan. He had all the information.”He added that Maken will speak to former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi and others about the decision.“We are providing good governance in Rajasthan and the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) has been being wiped out… it came third and the fourth in the by-polls to two seats,” Gehlot said.The Cabinet reshuffle has been awaited since Gehlot’s former deputy, Sachin Pilot, revoted against him last year. Congress functionaries aware of the matter said Pilot’s associates are likely to get at least four ministerial berths and those close to Gehlot five. There are nine vacancies in the council of ministers.Gehlot said the situation in the country is serious and that democracy and the Constitution are in danger as the judiciary and central agencies are being misused by the Union government.He asked the Centre to further reduce the excise duty on petrol and diesel.The Union government reduced the excise duty on petrol and diesel by ₹5 and ₹10 a litre on Diwali-eve.Folliwng this, many states ruled by the BJP and a few others followed suit. Rajasthan is among the states that hasn’t done so. Gehlot has pointed out that the state levy is anyway an ad valorem one, and that the reduction by the Central government also means a reduction to some quantum in state levies.On Thursday, he said that the share of states in duties on fuel have reduced (many of the central levies are cesses, which are not shared with the states) over the years and said he wants a “further reduction in excise duty on fuel prices. This will automatically reduce VAT.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/congress-high-command-to-decide-on-state-cabinet-reshuffle-ashok-gehlot-101636625124945.html
12-11-2021||Mumbai||Bollywood stars targeted to divert attention from Gujarat drug seizures: Malik||In yet another day of accusations and countercharges, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and state minister Nawab Malik on Thursday raised questions over the large haul of drugs seized from Gujarat in the recent weeks and said that Gujarat’s role in the country’s illegal narcotics supply chain should be investigated by central agencies.Later in the day, Malik’s daughter, Nilofer Khan sent a legal notice to Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Devendra Fadnavis and his wife Amruta, seeking an apology from them for claiming that her husband, Sameer, had possessed drugs. This was soon followed by Amruta Fadnavis sending a legal notice to Malik demanding deletion of tweets pertaining to Fadnavis’ alleged connections with drug dealers, within 48 hours.Since Monday, Fadnavis and Malik have traded accusations of wrongdoing. While Fadnavis accused Malik of buying property from persons linked with the underworld, and an accused in the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts case, Malik accused Fadnavis of protecting a fake currency racket in the aftermath of the 2016 demonetisation, while the latter was chief minister of Maharashtra. On November 1, Malik had also tweeted a photo of Fadnavis and his wife with an accused in a drug peddling case and claimed that the two knew him; the former CM and Amruta have denied this charge.On Thursday, Malik raised questions over the recent seizure of drugs worth ₹313 crore in Devbhumi Dwarka, and asked if “a drug game (racket)” was “being run from Gujarat”. “The Gujarat drug connection needs to be exposed and those involved need to be brought to justice. With another seizure of drug consignment at Dwarka in Gujarat on Wednesday, it has been established that drug consignments come to Gujarat via sea route and are distributed in the country,” Malik said.On Wednesday, the Gujarat police seized 17 kilogrammes of heroin and methamphetamine, cumulatively worth ₹88.25 crore from Devbhumi Dwarka district of Gujarat. They arrested three persons, including a vegetable vendor from Mumbra in Thane district called Sajjad Ghosi, which led to a recovery of 47 more packets of drugs from a residential premise in Salaya, Gujarat, worth ₹225 crore. In all, the haul totals ₹313.25 crore. In September, the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) seized around 3,000 kg of heroin worth around ₹21,000 crore from Mundra port in Kutch district. The case is being investigated by the National Investigation Agency (NIA).Malik drew a connection between independent witnesses in a drug raid conducted by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on a cruise ship in Mumbai and a Gujarat cabinet minister.“All those names such as Manish Bhanushali, Dhaval Bhanushali, KP Gosavi, Sunil Patil that cropped up in the investigation of Aryan Khan case, were operating from Gujarat. They used to stay at five star hotels and appear to be close confidantes of cabinet minister Kiritsinh Rana ji. Two major drug hauls have been seized from Gujarat, which creates a suspicion that a racket is active in the state. The central agencies like National Investigation Agency and NCB should conduct an impartial and thorough probe,” Malik said.Malik has tweeted photos of both Patil and Gosavi with the minister in past weeks.Manish Bhanushali and KP Gosavi are independent witnesses for the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) in a drug raid conducted on a cruise ship docked off the coast of Mumbai on October 2. The cruise raid led to the arrest of 20 persons, including Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son, Aryan (23). Earlier this week, BJP leader Mohit Kamboj claimed that Patil was an NCP party worker who gave the tip-off about the cruise ship party to Bhanushali. Patil has denied both allegations.Gujarat minister Kiritsinh Rana and the ruling BJP on Thursday refuted Malik’s allegations.“I don’t know any of the people (named by Malik). We are catching people (involved in drugs trade) in Gujarat, too. The law is equal for everyone and those who have done anything wrong will be punished,” Rana said. “Malik ji, you should first investigate how the drug mafia Sajjad managed to run this illegal trade without any fear from Mumbai and who was protecting him till now. I am proud of Gujarat police for seizing the drugs” minister of state for Home Harsh Sanghavi said in a tweet.Malik on Thursday said that Bollywood celebrities possessing few grams of drugs were being penalised by central agencies to create a perception that Mumbai is a hub of drugs. This was being done to divert attention from drug seizures in Gujarat and allow the illegal trade without hurdle.Malik’s son-in-law Sameer Khan was arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) in January and was released on bail in September; Malik has alleged that Sameer was wrongly arrested. Fadnavis on November 1 had claimed that drugs were found in Sameer Khan’s possession.Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Thursday said that the haul of drugs from Gujarat’s Devbhumi Dwarka district is a matter of concern, and said that the NCB officials must study the 350-kg drugs that were seized in September.“It is a matter of concern that drugs have been recovered from Dwarka. The officers and zonal directors [of the NCB] who had got international acclaim by seizing a gram or half a gram [of drug], must study this 300-350 kg drugs. Over 3500kg of drugs was found in Gujarat earlier, now again drugs have been recovered worth about ₹100 crore. They must see if the people from Gujarat film industry or children of the rich were involved in this. The country must know what the team of NCB is doing in Gujarat,” Raut said in Delhi.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bollywood-stars-targeted-to-divert-attention-from-gujarat-drug-seizures-malik-101636623084821.html
12-11-2021||Chandigarh||BSF jurisdiction: Punjab assembly unanimously passes resolution against Centre’s move||The Punjab Vidhan Sabha on Thursday passed a resolution against the Centre’s notification that extended the jurisdiction of the Border Security Force (BSF) up to 50km inside the international border even as the opposition parties questioned the delay by the Congress government in moving the Supreme Court against the order. This was the last assembly session during the tenure of the present Congress government. The resolution was adopted unanimously by the state assembly, “rejecting” the Union home ministry’s October 11 order in the absence of the two members of the Bharatiya Janata Party, which is in power at the Centre, from the House. Former chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, who quit the Congress last month and has backed the extension in BSF’s operational remit, also did not attend the proceedings. All other parties, including the opposition Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), supported the official resolution on the concluding day of the two-day special session convened after an all-party meeting resolved to oppose and reject the Union government’s notification. However, both AAP and SAD also questioned the delay in challenging the notification in the apex court. The Centre had amended the BSF Act to authorise the border guarding force to carry out “arrest, search and seizure” within 50km, up from the existing 15km, from the international border in Punjab, West Bengal and Assam. Deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, who holds the home portfolio, moved the resolution demanding the withdrawal of the Centre’s directive. Terming the Centre’s move “an attack on the federal structure”, Randhawa said the state government will challenge the notification in the Punjab and Haryana high court. “As per the Constitution of India, maintaining law and order is the responsibility of the state government, and for this purpose, government of Punjab is fully competent. The decision of extending the jurisdiction of the BSF by the Union government is an expression of distrust towards the police and people of Punjab. This is their insult,” the resolution stated, stressing on prior consultation. Citing a letter written by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2012 to the then UPA government as the Gujarat chief minister against a similar move that separate state was being created within the state, Randhawa suggested that the House members should meet the PM over the issue. As SAD and AAP members rose to speak on the matter, speaker Rana KP Singh and parliamentary affairs minister Brahm Mohindra said there was no need for debate as the matter had already been discussed at length in the all-party meeting. The speaker later allowed the members to give their suggestions. Raising the issue of delay in moving the SC against the notification, SAD member Birkam Singh Majithia said the Congress government in the state should also take a decision that the Punjab police would not give cooperation to the BSF beyond 15km. He then hit out at Randhawa for allowing the BSF into the state by asking for their deployment in jails for security. “What purpose will the resolution serve? There have been 16 resolutions so far, but none has been implemented,” he said. While finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal said he (Majithia) was trying to gain political advantage on this issue, chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi said this was not one person’s fight and they (political parties) were all together in it. Congress member Navjot Singh Sidhu asked why the Akali Dal chief (Sukhbir Singh Badal) did not attend the all-party meeting on such an important issue. Kharar MLA Kanwar Sandhu suggested that the Punjab government should get in touch with other states such as Rajasthan, Gujarat and J&K and together press for an amendment in the BSF Act to incorporate a clause regarding prior consultation with states before any such changes. SAD (Sanyukt) member Parminder Singh Dhindsa and AAP member Aman Arora asked the CM to share the details of his meeting with the PM and Union home minister Amit Shah after which the Centre issued the BSF notification. “We should have acted promptly after the MHA came out with this directive. It has been one month, but we are still discussing what needs to be done. Why it (directive) has not been challenged in SC,” Arora asked. Leader of Opposition Harpal Singh Cheema suggested a resolution against former chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh in the House for repeatedly raising the bogey of security, asking the CM what was his (Channi’s) deal with PM and Amit Shah on the BSF issue. Hitting back, Channi said the SAD always saw everything through the narrow prism of politics, especially the issues of utmost importance to Punjab such as devolution of more powers to states, transfer of Chandigarh to Punjab. “They allowed entry to the BJP and RSS in Punjab. They became the gateway through which the RSS, which has always been inimical to the interests of Punjab, managed to make inroads in the State. When the RSS and its political wing the BJP undermined the federal structure of the country by revoking the Article 370 not only did the Akalis sided with the BJP but SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal spoke in its favour,” he said, On meeting Modi and Shah, Channi said that his meetings with them were a courtesy call. “The Akalis have chosen to forget very conveniently that I wrote letters to the Union Government emphasizing the reopening of the Kartarpur corridor, besides pleading with it repeatedly to roll back the three draconian agricultural farm laws,” he added, categorically stating that he never asked them to increase the jurisdiction of the BSF in the state. However, AAP and SAD members were not satisfied with his reply. They started protesting and entered the well of the House, raising slogans against the state government, before staging symbolic walkouts, separately.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bsf-jurisdiction-punjab-assembly-unanimously-passes-resolution-against-centre-s-move-101636620264583.html
12-11-2021||Mumbai||North to south Mumbai during peak traffic hours is tiring and tedious||In 2016, an Environmental Impact Assessment Report prepared by a consultancy firm at the behest of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) included a section based on traffic surveys that were conducted at 17 locations where major highways met nodal arterial roads. The report was meant to study the feasibility of the coastal road project — an ambitious project that aims to connect south Mumbai to its northern suburb, Kandivli — and found that cars, taxis and jeeps (light fast vehicles) dominated the traffic volume count. At Mumbai Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj international airport — one of the locations selected —nearly 68% of the average daily traffic comprised light fast vehicles. According to Vijay Nighot, chief engineer of the Coastal Road Project, “Travel time will reduce by about 70% due to the Coastal Road. The road will also have a dedicated bus route for plying BEST buses with bus stops.” Opinions on the efficacy of the coastal road to ease the transportation woes is however, divided.We undertook the journey over four different transportation modes to understand the time it takes for the average Mumbaiite to travel between Kandivli and Nariman Point during the peak hours in the morning and the evening. For those travelling by bus, the journey takes up close to 3.30 to 4 hours; it take a quarter of that time to travel by train, though last mile connectivity is still a pain point. For the biker, traffic snarls at most parts of the journey, including a freeway like the Western Express Highway, meant a long uncomfortable ride of close to two hours. And for those who wish to book a cab over an aggregator service, the woes are compounded as the ride, though long, isn’t financially viable according to many cab drivers. Since the publication the EIA, the coastal road project has undergone changes. For one, the BMC is now incharge of constructing only one part of it: a 10.58km-long road that will connect Marine Drive to the Worli end of the Bandra-Worli Sea Link. The Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation is incharge of developing the northern half of the coastal road, from Bandra to Kandivli. According to the BMC, 41% of the work — which includes building under-sea tunnels, elevated roads, roads over stilts, bridges and reclaiming land — is over.Urban planner Rohit Shinkre said, “I recently read statistics that show about 10% of citizens own cars, and about 6% actually use the cars for their daily commute. However, largely the idea of using public transport is associated with discomfort. Now that the Sea Link is in use for so many years, authorities can collate and assess data and actually analyse whether it has helped ease traffic flow, cut fuel cost and cost of commute, and led to decongestion. In my experience, this is not true before you get onto the Sea Link, and once you get off it — those portions are still congested. So the coastal road may ease discomfort of a journey for a partial distance, for a few commuters.”Experts point out that metros should encourage public transport. How will either scenario — encouraging mass transit or building a coastal road — help the average Mumbaiite? Judging by the commutes we undertook, it’s going to take a lot more to ease travel in the city. BUS: NINE HOURS ON THE ROADUrban developers talk about the need to strengthen mass transit modes like buses for a reason: they’re far more effective in transporting a larger number of people for the space they occupy on a road compared to say, a car. But travelling in a bus isn’t the most time-efficient experience for the average Mumbaikar. I undertook two peak-hour journeys across Greater Mumbai — from Nariman Point to Kandivali railway station and vice versa —in buses and found that I spent an average of four hours one way. On the whole, I spent nearly nine hours on the road, hoping across five buses. Let’s start with the return journey. From the bus stop at Nariman Point’s National Centre for Performing Arts (NCPA), I waited 10 minutes to take the 137 to CST railway station. The bus journey took 30 minutes and stopped seven times. I had to cross the road (taking the underpass) toward the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) headquarters, in order to catch the 51-C bus to Santacruz bus depot (the central node for BEST buses in the western suburbs). Most passengers used the bus to make shorter journeys to Nagpada, Byculla, Lalbaug and Dadar. The ride to Santacruz took a little over an hour, making 38 stops. I reached the Santacruz bus depot around 9pm. There, I waited for at least 25 minutes to board route number 202, which goes to Gorai depot over the arterial SV Road and passes through Andheri, Jogeshwari, Goregaon and Malad. This time, I was fortunate to find a seat. The journey took a little over two hours, and I reached Kandivli railway station after 34 stops at 11.10pm — just 20 minutes short of a five-hour journey. By this time, peak hour traffic had dissipated.Travelling from Kandivli to Nariman Point in the morning rush hour traffic took 4 hours and 17 minutes. I took the 202 bus from Kandivli station at 9.30am and we crawled along SV Road. I reached Santacruz bus depot an hour and 40 minutes later. There, I switched to bus number 51-C to CST and encountered traffic jams all the way to Dadar. By 1 pm however, as the bus hit Parel, the rush hour traffic cleared up. The final stretch through Lalbaug, Byculla and Nagpada took a quick 40 minutes, and the 202 bus route from CST to Nariman Point dropped me off at the NCPA bus stop at 1:47 pm exactly.On average nearly 2.4 million passengers travel daily in the 3500 BEST buses in the city. However, for a suburban resident, a long bus ride to the work district in South Mumbai is certainly not the answer to their transportation needs.— Prayag Arora DesaiBIKE: UNDER A BLAZING SUNTwo-wheeler journeys in Mumbai’s humidity and blazing sun are strenuous. In addition to the weather, peak hour traffic snarls and constant honking elevate stress levels of riders. Hindustan Times photographer Satish Bate and I set out for this test drive knowing well that it would be a long ride. It was. We had to travel 39 km but we didn’t have the option to take the Worli Sea-link, as two-wheelers are not allowed on it (the sea link would have cut travel time by several minutes). We left our start point, the Kandivli Station, at 9.30am and hit slow-moving traffic at the very start of the Western Express Highway at Kandivali. At Malad and Jogeshwari, we had to halt for a minute each because of traffic jams. The movement was streamlined as an extra lane was opened from Kandivli onwards on the northbound road for traffic heading south. The journey eased slightly as we crossed Mahim: we were part of a traffic snarl at Tilak Bridge in Dadar and on Pedder Road in south Mumbai. Once we hit the seafront near Wilson College, it was a smooth ride to Nariman Point. The whole ride took an hour and 56 minutes.Narrowed space available on the roads due to construction of the coastal road along Marine Drive made the going slow for four-wheelers en route to Babulnath — not so for Satish and I.. This stretch took us merely 16 minutes as we left Maker Chambers at 6.30 pm, the peak hour of evening traffic. Again, at Jaslok hospital, two-wheelers like ours managed to escape the congestion. The longest halt was in south Mumbai near Worli junction where a lone traffic policeman was trying to manage vehicular movement. Within 45 minutes we had reached Mahim, where once more, pedestrian traffic (towards the Dargah) slowed us.Barring the congestion on joining the Western Express highway at Bandra, the traffic was fairly fast moving towards the western suburbs till we reached Jogeshwari. That’s where the chaos began. Starting at Jogeshwari flyover till we took the turn near the Growel’s Mall in Kandivli, traffic was bumper to bumper. No car had broken down, no barricading justified the jam. The five-km stretch took 35 minutes to negotiate. We reached our end point at 8.40, two hours and 10 minutes later.The share of light vehicles ranged from 88% at Santacruz flyover to 99% at Worli Dairy. In 2015, there were 1.4 million two-wheelers in Greater Mumbai. By 2017-18, the number had crossed 2 million. Even the pandemic hasn’t slowed down sales. The convenience of negotiating traffic snarls is a significant reason to aid the decision to buy a two-wheeler. But the journey certainly doesn’t justify the purchase. — Jyoti Shelar and Satish BateCAB: A COSTLY, UNCOMFORTABLE RIDEWould a Mumbaiite chose a bullock-cart for an over 36-km long commute within Mumbai city to go home at the end of a workday? Sitting in a cab, booked on an aggregator application, felt similar. The ride from Maker Chambers in Nariman Point to Kandivli Station took two hours and 20 minutes, with bumper-to-bumper traffic along most of Western Express highway — a freeway with no traffic signals. The average speed we mustered was 16 km/ hour, travelling after 6.30 pm on a workday evening.Four cab drivers refused the ride which was surprising, because users of cab aggregator services assume that a long ride would be preferable than shorter ones. Turns out, that’s not the case and here’s why. Drivers of aggregate cabs receive a booking via the mobile application, but they can only chose to accept without knowing either destination or fare. For the four who refused to take me to Kandivli, the pre-decided fare was simply not viable for them. Each time, I cancelled the booking on their request, a surcharge was applied and eventually the last booking cost ₹1,500. A black and yellow taxi would have cost ₹611 for the same distance. Since the fare is not calculated in real-time with a meter for an aggregate cab, most cab drivers of aggregator apps prefer not to take long journeys on busy routes. I switched apps, and booked a ride for ₹746. The cab driver who agreed to take me to Kandivli only did so on the condition that I would agree to take the Bandra-Worli sea link, where I paid a toll of ₹85. However, barricades along the Worli promenade all the way up to the Sea Link, slowed down traffic considerably. In fact, the journey between Bandra and Kandivli via the Western Expressway — 60% of the distance — took up 75% of the time.The highway beyond Bandra had bumper to bumper traffic, regardless of traffic signals or bottlenecks. Even flyovers were choked.Commuting on the same route (starting at Kandivli Station) in the morning peak hour — we left Kandivli at 9.30 am — was equally tedious, but less time consuming. In the morning, the Western Express highway up till Bandra was less congested. However, traffic was considerably denser on Marine Drive and around Mantralaya. It took longer to cross the sea face at Haji Ali, and Pedder Road, in comparison to the time it took during the evening peak hour. Luckily, the first cab that I booked agreed to the commute. The journey was completed in one hour and 52 minutes, and cost ₹642. On the whole, the commute is basically unaffordable for any salaried middle class person.— Eeshanpriya MSTRAIN: FASTEST RIDE IN TOWN For the average Mumbaiite, train journeys are the most reliable form of mass transit and are inexpensive — a monthly pass costs a few hundred rupees depending on the destinations — but when it comes to peak hours, it’s always a gamble. Is it better to hop on to a slow train or wait for a fast one? Will the next train have space to accommodate you? In case one lands up in a slow train, does it save time to board a fast train eventually to travel a longer route? And, in the midst of a pandemic, is it safe?The Western Railway transports at least 3.5 million passengers a day — since the pandemic started and the government put restrictions on who can travel by train (only those who are doubly vaccinated, even if they are essential workers), the numbers have fallen.Even so, delays are built in to this mode of transport, as many passengers switch between slow and fast trains at different platforms. In the pandemic, in an effort to prevent crowding at ticket counters, the railway has permitted only monthly passes for double-vaccinated people.For this test drive, I reached Kandivli station at 9.33 am on a Thursday. I had missed a fast train to Churchgate by four minutes and the next train to arrive was a 9.36 slow local for Andheri. I boarded the train that came after that in the hope that it would be less crowded, taking instead the 9.40am Churchgate-bound slow train. Waiting for the next fast train would have meant spending another 13 minutes at the station. Many daily commuters who board trains from slow destinations like Kandivli, Malad or Goregaon prefer switching to a fast train from Andheri to save time. By the time we reached Andheri, it was 10.05 am. Alighting from this train, I walked to another platform to board the 10.12 fast train to Churchgate — it was far more crowded than the slow train I had left. Not everyone had their mask on — many had it pulled under their chin. It took exactly 10 minutes to reach the next station, Bandra, and another seven minutes to reach Dadar. By 10.45 am, I had reached Churchgate.Taxis or buses are the only options for last mile connectivity from the station to Maker Chambers in Nariman Point. Most commuters opt for a shared cab. I did too. The one I sat in left the station at 10.49 am and I reached Maker Chambers at 10.55 am. The six-minute-long ride cost ₹15. The evening journey back to Kandivli was faster because of the fast train available from Churchgate. The train was packed. A slow train would have taken about 20 minutes longer than a fast train but it would likely have been less crowded.— Jyoti Shelar||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/north-to-south-mumbai-during-peak-traffic-hours-is-tiring-and-tedious-101636571187040.html
12-11-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai coastline crisis: Urban flooding is a public health issue||In the past decade, 14-year-old Gausuddin Sayyed has visited the local homeopathic practitioner’s clinic at least five times every year. Each time, his complaints were similar: wheezing, choked nasal passage and cough. The healer would give him medicine for allergic bronchitis. Sayyed would complete the course over three to six days depending on the severity of the bout. He would get better. Then it was time for treatment again. The teenager lives in Cheetah Camp near Chembur with his younger brother, Moinuddin (12), mother, Rehmat (32) and father Farid (40). Their two-room house is located on the edge of the Vashi creek and floods often: not just every monsoon, but even during a particularly high tide. After the water recedes, the walls grow a layer of green fungus or mold which gets darker in colour each passing day. Gausuddin and Moinuddin would wait till the mold thickened before scraping it off their walls. Soon after the cleaning exercise, Sayyed’s bout of respiratory discomfort would flare-up. “The fungus and the dampness triggered his allergies according to the doctor,” said Rehmat, who works as a community volunteer for the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS). From dampness to airFungi needs nutrients like carbohydrates, proteins and lipids to thrive and they find these nutrients easily on plants, walls, and wood among other surfaces. Fungal growth also requires moisture. Add to that improper or poor ventilation — like where Gausuddin lives —and the perennial nature of his ill-health becomes explicable.Molds are a common type of fungi that spread rapidly on damp surfaces and release tiny spores into the air which can be inhaled easily. Dust mites and several fungi produce allergens associated with asthma and many fungi produce toxins and irritants that may affect respiratory health, a document by the World Health Organization (WHO) pointed out. “The indoor concentrations of some of these organisms and agents are known or suspected to be elevated in damp indoor environments and may affect the health of people living or working there. In particular, it has been suggested that dust mites and fungi, both of which favour damp environments, play a major role,” the document on indoor air quality, dampness and mold, stated.“Molds are common in our environment, but it’s the proximity, exposure and sensitivity to the molds that impact people,” said Rahul Phadtare, Gausuddin’s homoeopathic doctor, who advised the Sayyeds to move out of their home. “But where could we go? This has been our home for the past 14 years,” Rehmat said. Living with wetness For the Sayyeds, the problem of mold is connected to a bigger issue: urban flooding. Every monsoon, a large part of the M East ward — home to over 800,000 residents who comprise over 40% of the city’s slum population — gets flooded. The ward is close to Vashi creek, but several homes of the Cheetah Camp settlement, one of the main localities here (and where the Sayyeds stay), have been built over the creek by filling it up with debris. Environmentalists point out that the natural depth of the creek has reduced on account of this. The creek and a warren of nullahs that run through the ward serve an important function by allowing surface run-off of the water during high tide or in the monsoon. However, an ineffective sewage system and an ineffectual garbage disposal and collection mechanism mean that the nullahs are choked with waste. Nowhere to go, the water often spills into homes. “The water level rises above my waist level during heavy rainfall,” Rehmat said. Such flooding events pose a major risk to public health, medical experts said. “When flooding occurs, all sorts of organisms — bacteria, viruses, fungi — enter people’s homes, putting them at the risk of severe infections,” said Dr Nerges Mistry, director of Mumbai-based Foundation for Medical Research (FMR) which conducts advanced laboratory research in the field of neurology, immunology and microbiology. “Children, senior citizens and people with co-morbid conditions are the most vulnerable,” she added. Flooding events in Mumbai are not new. On July 26, 2005, Mumbai experienced a cloudburst with 944 mm of rain in a span of 24 hours. According to an affidavit filed by the BMC in the Bombay high court, 546 people had died during the flood due to drowning and other related accidents. However, many more are believed to have died days after the flood due to flood-related illnesses and diseases. On 29 August 2017, the city experienced another devastating flooding event with 330 mm of rainfall reported within 12 hours killing nearly 20 people. Low-lying areas suffered the worst impact of the flooding, as water entered people’s homes, damaging property.This is only going to keep happening. Changing climatic conditions, pollution and coastal erosion exacerbate these events. A recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has warned that 12 Indian cities close to the coastline, Mumbai included, could be about three feet underwater by the end of this century, due to rising sea levels.The crisis, as we now understand it, is not the event itself or even its repetitiveness. The often invisible and unseen after-effects — like Gausuddin’s allergic bronchitis — are part of the unfolding catastrophe. An observational studyIn 2005, soon after the city was hit by floods, doctors at the civic-run KEM Hospital noticed an increase in the number of women requiring hospitalisation due to worsened asthma. Curious, the hospital’s health survey unit including resident doctors and volunteers visited the patients’ homes to investigate the possible environmental triggers. The KEM researchers used a steel tube to trap air from the patients’ homes and sent it for testing to the microbiology department. The findings showed severe mold infestations in their houses, which were located in areas that were severely affected during the floods. “We found two common types of fungi, aspergillosis and candida, during the onsite monitoring,” said Dr Amita Athavale, head of the pulmonary medicine department, KEM Hospital. Since the women spent more time in their homes, the KEM doctors believe that they had increased exposure to the molds, and that, in turn, caused their asthma to flare. Dr Rakesh Kumar, the former director of the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) said that floods can be linked to many public health hazards. Mold and other fungi are only one category.“Floods expose people to contaminated sewage water leading to gastrointestinal and diarrheal diseases, cause spurt of vector-borne diseases, and put people at the risk of bacterial infections like leptospirosis that is spread through the urine of rats, dogs and other animals,” he said. Since 2015, leptospirosis has killed 70 people under treatment in the civic-run hospitals in Mumbai. This is the highest death toll among monsoon-related diseases. For instance, in the same time period, malaria had killed 38 people, dengue 55 and Hepatitis A and E, 10. (See chart)Phadtare, the homeopathic practitioner who had treated Gausuddin since his childhood initially referred him to bigger civic hospitals assuming that his respiratory illness was triggered by an underlying condition. However, chest scans and other tests were always inconclusive. “He would feel healthier when he stayed with his grandmother in a nearby building. That’s when I could link his bouts to the mold infestation in his house,” he said. In Gausuddin’s case, as his home was perpetually prone to flooding, his allergies were triggered through the year — which explains why he had to visit the local healer so often. Early this year, the Sayyeds borrowed ₹2.5 lakh to increase the height of the flooring of their house and put tiles on half of the walls so that the floodwater does not dampen them. “So far, we have not had any flooding this year. Hopefully, my son’s allergies will reduce now,” said Rehmat. The BMC has undertaken a series of flooding mitigation measures over the past few years which includes de-silting and upgrading the stormwater drains, widening and deepening drains and water channels, hiring de-watering pumps in low-lying areas among other things. But a public health perspective would force us to rethink our approach to urban planning all together. “We need pre-emptive actions. And as we anticipate more such emergencies, we need to strengthen our public health infrastructure to cope,” Mistry of FMR said.“With the climate crisis, the intensity of rainfall is going up each year,” said urban planner and Mumbai-based architect Rahul Kadri. “Where will the water go if we have blocked all the estuaries and narrowed the mouth of rivers? It is going to fill up the city,” he said. Rivers swell during the monsoon and they need space to flow. “The more we block, the more the rivers will swell and cause flooding,” Kadri said.The three things for us to tackleDr Nerges Mistry,, director, Foundation for Medical Research (FMR) “When flooding occurs, all sorts of organisms — bacteria, viruses, fungi — enter people’s homes, putting them at the risk of severe infections. Children, senior citizens and people with co-morbid conditions are the most vulnerable,” Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner (health)“When we look at strengthening existing peripheral hospitals or creating more health care facilities, urban flooding and its threats are discussed vigorously.

12-11-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai coastline crisis: Koliwada residents face loss of livelihood||In Mahim Koliwada, a fishing colony metres from the city’s coastline, the day starts at 3 am for 47-year-old Bhushan Nijai. It started just as early for his father Yeshwant (72), and deceased grandfather Pandav, who have been fishing in the sane waters for the past 90 years. Nijai’s children — three girls aged 6 to 22 years — however, don’t wake up at the crack of dawn like their father. Unlike Nijai, who joined his family’s occupation as a fisher immediately after completing his Class 12, they don’t have anything to do with the trade. The Nijais aren’t the only family in the hamlet whose youngest generation has veered away from the century-old work. Their neighbour, Nitin Vaidya, has two young children, a girl aged 10 years and a boy aged six, neither of whom will be taking up the trade. Most of the fishers — all men — from the 5,000-resident strong Mahim village who take their boats out each morning are above 35. For them, catching, selling and eating fishing is their “astitva” (identity), they say.Nijhai’s oldest, Raksha, who is a commerce graduate, aspires for an office job. “I have seen my parents work very hard. My mother (Smita) also wakes up around 3am and goes to buy fish at Sassoon Docks, which she sells at a fish market in Dadar. They work long hours but our family’s debts have only increased. I know how to clean and buy fish, but if our situation has to improve I can’t continue in this line,” she said. Smita Nijai does not sell the fish that her husband catches; her business — and earnings — are separate. Depending on the day’s catch, Nijai sells the fish to wholesalers or small hotels. Fishing communities that have, by most historical accounts, lived along the Mumbai coastline since the 15th century, are increasingly finding their occupation unviable. More than a trade In 2003, Maharashtra’s department of fisheries estimated that 37,695 people in Greater Mumbai are completely reliant on small-scale fishing activities [or as it is called, artisan fishing, marked by small capital, short fishing trips closer to shore, use of small fishing vessels and local consumption]. In 2010, state-run Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute estimated that there were 40,953 small-scale fishers across the Greater Mumbai region, residing in 30 fishing villages. With an average family size of 4.4, that’s about 9,307 families — in a city of over 20 million — who are dependent on fishing and allied activities that includes everything from cold storage to boat repairs, net making and mending to selling fish.“The number of people, at least within Greater Mumbai, who are opting to fish full time, is only a small portion of our larger community,” said Devendra Tandel (40), who heads the state’s largest fisherfolk society, Akhil Maharashtra Machimaar Kruti Samiti. Tandel now has a full time job in a private bank.“Commercial trawling, overfishing, the cost of fuel and other operating capital is increasing, and there is an influx of migrant workers who now dominate the sale and distribution of fish,” Tandel said listing the issues that the fisherfolk community contends are problems that threaten them. “I have friends from the community who are doing jobs in IT and software and finance. Fishing can always be a backup for us, but it is not first choice.”“I am the last generation of my household that will stick to this occupation. In our line of work, we struggle to make ends meet and I don’t want the same fate for them,” Nijai said. Development storyBut the community is currently dealing with another, more pressing concern. The city’s landscape is undergoing changes and the kolis are on the edge.In 2011, a Joint Technical Committee of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) proposed a radical alteration to the city’s coastline that would connect the city’s southernmost tip to the suburbs of Vasai-Virar 70km away. In its current format, the Mumbai Coastal Road project includes a network of under-sea tunnels, elevated roads and several interchanges, most of which will be created over the sea and partly over reclaimed land. There is also the Mumbai Trans Harbour Link, off the eastern seafront, which promises to be the longest sea-bridge in the country. Add to this a range of beautification projects involving the reclamation of near-shore areas (comprising mangroves and sandy beaches) in Cuffe Parade and Versova. In 2018, the Mumbai Port Trust (MbPT) was appointed the special planning authority (SPA) for beautifying 966.30 hectares along the city’s 28-km eastern seafront. The plan also proposes public parks, plazas, promenades, walking trails and marinas apart from restaurants and cafés. The Union ministry for environment and climate change recently gave its nod to the Coastal Zone Management Plans (CZMPs) for Mumbai city and suburban districts, thus allowing construction up to 50m from the city’s high-tide line. This follows a 2019 amendment to the Coastal Regulatory Zone (CRZ) rules which, up until then, had prevented development up to 500m from the city’s high-tide line. With the easing of this norm, existing coastal properties would be allowed to develop at least two and a half times their existing floor space. Liases Foras, a real estate research firm, estimates that around 10,000 old buildings in Mumbai will benefit from this. And now, the effectWork on the first phase of the Coastal Road project began in 2018 and since then, fishing communities have attempted to direct the attention of the city municipality and the state government to the impact of this project on fishing commons —the shore and intertidal areas that are collectively used by the community without title.At Cleveland Bunder, a fishing port in Worli koliwada (fishing village), two connecting bridges will come up between the coastal road at Worli and the Bandra Worli Sea Link (BWSL) to allow seamless flow of traffic. Fisherfolk said this interchange will severely constrict the only navigational route available to their boats venturing out to the open sea.Since October 30, residents of the village have been staging a protest at sea at the site of this upcoming interchange: fishers in 100 boats have dropped anchors near a construction site in Worli, where an interchange is slated to come up and, which the fisherfolk say, will prevent safe passage to fishing commons. Municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal has agreed to an independent review of their demands for a re-design of the interchange. Other fishers along the South Mumbai coast from Priyadarshini Park to Worli too, have begun to report declining fish stocks — in this particular stretch, land has been reclaimed and a connecting bridge is coming up at Haji Ali — as space for small-scale fishers on non-motorised boats and fisherwomen to pick oysters and shellfish has reduced. This comes at a time when the state’s fish stocks are showing a drastic decline. In 2019-20, fish landings reported their lowest harvest in 45 years, while reports show a decreasing, year-on-year trend since 2017.Fisher communities who stay on the eastern coastline in places like Sewri, Mazagaon, and Wadala fear that beautification projects like the one being planned by MbPT, would recast indigenous land use to a public space for larger citizenry that would eventually nudge them out.Fisherfolk are also caught in the net of other development projects. For instance, in Bandra’s Chimbai village, the fisheries department is building a jetty and construction material now occupies the grounds used by fisherfolk to sort and dry fish. Although the land is owned by the BMC, its own Development Plan 2034 for Mumbai has classified this area as “a fish and net drying yard.” (The civic body can affect a change in the land use, but there is a process for it to do so.) In September, in response to a petition by the Mariyayi Macchimar Sahakari Sanstha Maryadit, a society of fishers in and around Thane creek, the Bombay high court instituted a committee to create a fisherfolk rehabilitation policy for the state that would devise a standard operating procedure to gauge the impact of development projects undertaken by the government that affect fisher communities. Saving a way of lifeOne of the things that fisherfolk are demanding is freehold possession of their commons (land on which they park their boats, or dry fish, for example) because there is no public document available that delineates what land belongs to them, and what can be rightfully used by the state.“All the koliwadas in Mumbai are supposed to be mapped and demarcated in the coastal zone management plan (CZMP). This is a provision of the CRZ 2019 as well. In Mumbai, the koliwadas have been mapped, but the plans have not been released for public scrutiny, revised and accordingly incorporated in the CZMP. It leaves us completely in the dark about which lands around our villages are going to be opened up for development,” Tandel said.The community has tried to adapt, of course, with some assistance from the fisheries department that has provided critical infrastructure like fish landing centres in Mumbai’s koliwadas and diesel subsidies. Others have tried supplementing their traditional livelihoods with more aspirational jobs. Nijhai estimates that in his own lifetime, the income from fishing has shrunk by three quarters. The pandemic only sped up the process. “It is really the poorest of the poor who are left to fend for themselves on fishing. Our practice won’t die out, but the struggle will get harder,” he said.Sanjay Wategaonkar, Assistant commissioner of fisheries department, Mumbai districtWe are committed to helping small scale fishers... We are pushing for starting a credit scheme similar to the Central government’s Kisan Credit Card. As for impact of infra projects, we provide NOCs only if the project proponent commits to not disrupting fisherfolk livelihoods Bhushan Nijai, Fisher, Mahim Koliwada“I am the last generation of my household that will stick to this occupation.

12-11-2021||World||Pakistan to mull transportation of Indian wheat to Afghanistan, says PM Imran Khan||Islamabad will favourably consider a proposal to transport wheat offered by New Delhi as humanitarian aid for the people of Afghanistan through Pakistani territory, Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Friday. Khan conveyed his country’s position on the matter to the Taliban’s acting foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, during a meeting in Islamabad, according to tweets from the official account of the prime minister’s office. The development came a day after India emphasised the urgent need to provide humanitarian aid to the Afghan people and acknowledged, without directly naming Pakistan that efforts in this regard are being held up by the lack of unhindered access. India’s efforts to provide relief materials to the Afghan people in recent weeks, including an offer to supply 50,000 tonnes of wheat, have been held up by Pakistan’s refusal to allow the use of its territory for transporting the aid. “The Prime Minister conveyed that in the current context Pakistan would favourably consider the request by Afghan brothers for transportation of wheat offered by India through Pakistan on exceptional basis for humanitarian purposes and as per modalities to be worked out,” said a tweet from the Pakistani prime minister’s office. Khan told Muttaqi and his delegation that Pakistan had consistently called for the provision of immediate humanitarian relief for Afghanistan. He reiterated “Pakistan’s resolve to stand by the Afghan people by extending all possible support including humanitarian assistance-in-kind to withstand the coming winter season”. Pakistan will provide essential food items, including wheat and rice, emergency medical supplies, and shelter items to Afghanistan, he said. Khan also “underscored the urgent need to release Afghanistan’s frozen assets and facilitation of banking transactions to prevent an economic meltdown”. He conveyed Pakistan’s support to Afghanistan and its people in overcoming the dire challenges faced by the country. He stressed the importance of a “peaceful, stable, sovereign, prosperous and connected Afghanistan for Pakistan and the region”. He said that “continued security and resolute counter-terrorism actions, respect for rights of all Afghans, and inclusivity in governance and politics would further contribute to Afghanistan’s stability”. He also hoped the Taliban setup in Kabul “will continue to constructively engage the international community and will keep on taking positive measures to address the prevailing challenges”. On Thursday, Pakistan hosted a meeting of the “extended troika” that was attended by special envoys of China, Russia and the US to discuss the situation in Afghanistan. The members of the extended troika also met Muttaqi and his delegation on the sidelines of the meeting. According to a joint statement issued after the meeting of the extended troika, the members of the group expressed concern at the severe humanitarian and economic situation in Afghanistan, and called for arrangements for commercial air traffic in order to enable the uninterrupted flow of humanitarian aid. The extended troika also called on the Taliban to take steps to form an inclusive and representative government that respects the rights of all Afghans and provides for equal rights of women and girls. The group agreed to continue “practical engagement” with the Taliban to encourage moderate and prudent policies to achieve a stable and prosperous Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-to-mull-transportation-of-indian-wheat-to-afghanistan-says-pm-imran-khan-101636740766386.html
12-11-2021||World||UK imposes export bar on gold ornament from Tipu Sultan throne||A gold jewelled tiger head, which once belonged to the gold-covered throne of Mysore ruler Tipu Sultan in 18th century India, was on Friday placed under a temporary export bar in an attempt to find a UK buyer for it.The finial, or a crowning ornament, is worth around GBP 1.5 million and the export bar placed by the British government is used to allow time for a UK gallery or institution to acquire the piece of historic value.The finial is one of eight gold tiger heads that adorned the throne of the ruler, famously known as the "Tiger of Mysore".“This fascinating finial illustrates the story of Tipu Sultan’s reign and leads us to examine our imperial history,” said UK Arts Minister Lord Stephen Parkinson.“I hope a UK-based buyer comes forward so that we can all continue to learn more about this important period in our shared history with India,” he said.The finial, made of gold and set with rubies, diamonds and emeralds, is described as a rare example of fully documented 18th century South Indian goldsmiths’ work and its existence was unknown until 2009.Its marble pedestal is unique among the five surviving finials known, and the meaning of its gold inscription is still a mystery.The decision on the export licence application for the finial has been deferred until February 11, 2022, which may be extended until 11 June 2022 if a serious intention to raise funds to purchase it is made at the recommended price of GBP 1.5 million.The minister's decision follows the advice of the Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art and Objects of Cultural Interest (RCEWA), which agreed that it is an important symbolic object in Anglo-Indian history in the last years of the 18th century."Tipu Sultan's golden and bejewelled throne (c.1787-93) was broken up by the British army's Prize Agents after Tipu's defeat and death in defence of his capital, Seringapatam, in 1799. This tiger's head is one of the original eight which were placed on the balustrade of the octagonal throne," said RCEWA Member Christopher Rowell."This tiger's head, one of four throne finials to survive, including a head in the Clive Museum at Powis Castle (NT), should remain in the country together with the other fragments of the throne, and I hope that every effort will be made to achieve this,” he said.Rowell explained that each gold tiger's head from the railing is slightly differently set with gemstones, which makes this example both part of a set and unique in its design.Its quality attests to the expertise of Tipu Sultan's goldsmiths and jewellers, in whose productions he took a close personal interest.The head of the large gold rock crystal tiger which supported the throne, and a bejewelled huma bird which perched on the pinnacle of its canopy, were presented to Britain's George III and Queen Charlotte.“The tiger and its stripes were Tipu Sultan’s personal symbols. ‘Better to live one day as a tiger than 1,000 years as a sheep’ he famously declared. His flirtation with Napoleonic France led to his downfall at British hands,” added Rowell.Tipu Sultan was regarded as the greatest threat to the British East India Company until his defeat and death in 1799.As ruler of Mysore, Tipu identified himself and his personal possessions with tiger imagery and experts believe this finial offers scholars the opportunity to illustrate the vibrant culture of Tipu Sultan’s court and closely examine British imperial history.Three surviving contemporary images of the throne are all in the UK.Tipu's defeat had great historical significance to Britain’s imperial past, leading to a contemporary fascination with Tipu’s story and objects.Following his defeat, many objects from Tipu’s treasury arrived in Britain, where they influenced poetry (John Keats), fiction (Charles Dickens; Wilkie Collins), artists (J.M.W.Turner) and attracted much public interest.The RCEWA made its recommendation to ministers on the grounds that the finial’s departure from the UK would be a “misfortune” because it is so closely connected with UK history and national life and is of outstanding significance for the study of royal propaganda and 18th-century Anglo-Indian history.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-imposes-export-bar-on-gold-ornament-from-tipu-sultan-throne-101636736136186.html
12-11-2021||World||New York welcomes back tourists after 20 months as US reopens travel||New York is welcoming back visitors with open arms after the US ended its 20-month Covid travel restrictions, but it will likely take several years before the number of tourists to the Big Apple reaches pre-pandemic levels.The economic and cultural powerhouse of Manhattan is already feeling busier since the United States lifted its ban on "non-essential" travel on November 8, with Europeans among the early returnees.Eglantine Lasserre, a 40-year-old from Bordeaux, was on the first flight to NYC out of France on Monday."New York has always been a dream of mine, so when I heard about the reopening of the borders I jumped at the opportunity," she told AFP beneath the giant electronic billboards of Times Square.French couple Alexis Maynier, 33 and his wife Camille also decided to make their first trip to New York this week.On a piercing blue-sky fall day, they enjoyed the freedom of meandering around Broadway, 5th Avenue and Central Park."We were under a lot of constraints and now we want to go back to more normal activities," said Maynier, referring to the nearly two years of various pandemic restrictions in France."We want to enjoy and not think too much about these concerns," he added.The ban, first imposed by ex-president Donald Trump in March 2020, impacted foreign visitors from about 30 countries, including those in the European Schengen area, Britain, China, India and Russia.Visitors can now travel to the US provided they are fully vaccinated, a landmark moment in New York's bid to recover economically from the pandemic.The city welcomed almost 67 million tourists in 2019. They brought in $70 billion and more than 400,000 jobs, according to Chris Heywood, executive vice president of NYC & Company, the city's tourism board."Tourism is an economic engine of our city. It's really the lifeblood of this economy," he told AFP.With 8.5 million foreign tourists expected to visit New York in 2022, he recognizes it is "going to take a few years for us to fully be back," in the global tourism competition against Paris, London and Rome.'It feels good'"We're expecting by the end of 2024 to be back to the levels that we were in 2019," said Heywood.The diverse metropolis of 8.5 million people spanning the five boroughs of Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and Staten Island has already come along way.In spring 2020, the city was unrecognizable.Manhattan's normally choked roads and sidewalks were deserted, resembling the science fiction movie "Vanilla Sky," as residents self-confined at home, only venturing out for essential food supplies.Hospital and funeral services were overwhelmed by the crisis that has killed more than 34,000 New Yorkers.Slowly the city has come back to life: Broadway is in full flow again and restaurants and bars are busy. Many workers have yet to return to offices though, leaving business districts still feeling quieter than before Covid-19.New York requires proof of vaccination to enter museums, theatres, cinemas and restaurants, providing a sense of comfort for residents and visitors."We feel completely safe and we even tend to forget everything we've been through, and it feels good," said Lasserre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-welcomes-back-tourists-after-20-months-as-us-reopens-travel-101636736941751.html
12-11-2021||World||Biden, Xi set virtual summit for Monday to discuss tensions||President Joe Biden and China's Xi Jinping will hold their much-anticipated virtual summit on Monday evening as the two sides look to dial back tensions after a rough start to the US-China relationship since Biden took office earlier this year.The White House is setting low expectations for the video call between the leaders.Biden looks to stress that the two nations need to set guardrails in deepening areas of conflict in the increasingly complicated relationship between the two nations. White House officials said that no major announcements are expected to come from the meeting.“The two leaders will discuss ways to responsibly manage the competition between the United States and the PRC, as well as ways to work together where our interests align," White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement announcing the timing of the summit, referring to the People's Republic of China.“Throughout, President Biden will make clear US intentions and priorities and be clear and candid about our concerns."The meeting will be the third engagement between the two leaders since February. It comes after the US and China this week pledged at UN climate talks in Glasgow, Scotland to increase their cooperation and speed up action to rein in climate-damaging emissions.White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan and senior Chinese foreign policy adviser Yang Jiechi came to an agreement on holding the Biden-Xi virtual summit by year's end when they met last month for talks in Zurich but the two sides had not settled on a date.The virtual meeting was proposed after Biden, who spent a substantial amount of time with Xi when the two were vice presidents, mentioned during a September phone call with the Chinese leader that he would like to be able to see Xi again, according to the White House.Xi has not left China during the coronavirus pandemic. White House officials proposed a virtual summit as the best available substitute for the two leaders to have a substantive conversation on a number of issues that have put strains on the U.S.-China relationship.“We hope the U.S. will work together with China to jointly strive to make the leaders' summit a success and bring China-U.S. ties back to the right track of sound and stable development,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said Friday.There has been no shortage of tension in the relationship in recent months as Biden has made clear he sees Beijing's actions on a number of fronts as concerning.The president has criticized China for human rights abuses against ethnic minorities in northwest China, squelching pro-democracy efforts in Hong Kong, and resisting global pressure to cooperate fully with investigations into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic. Tensions have also been exacerbated recently by the Chinese military's flying dozens of sorties near the self-ruled island of Taiwan, which Beijing considers part of its territory.Biden, at the Group of 20 meeting in Rome and again at the U.N. climate gathering, criticized Xi for failing to show up to the summits, where world leaders discussed the way forward on the pandemic and steps to ease the impact of climate change."I think it's been a big mistake, quite frankly, for China ... not showing up, “ Biden said in Glasgow. ”The rest of the world is going to look to China and say, what value added have they provided?"Both leaders took part in Friday's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) virtual meeting, where leaders discussed efforts to end the COVID-19 pandemic and support the global economic recovery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bidenxi-set-virtual-summit-for-monday-to-discuss-tensions-101636737605208.html
12-11-2021||World||1 million Afghan children at risk of dying by year-end amid food crisis: WHO||As conditions in Afghanistan continue to worsen in the aftermath of Taliban recapturing the nation following the pullout of the United States and other foreign forces, the World Health Organisation (WHO) on Friday said that at least one million children in the war-ravaged nation are at the risk of dying by the end of the year as temperatures drop.According to a Reuters report, the United Nations (UN) health agency said that nearly 3.2 million children are likely to suffer from acute malnutrition in Afghanistan by the end of 2021 of whom one million are at the risk of losing their lives.“It’s an uphill battle as starvation grips the country,” WHO spokesperson Margaret Harris said stressing that the international community “must not and cannot afford” to turn its back to Afghanistan.Speaking from Kabul, Harris said temperatures at night have begun dipping below zero degrees Celsius and the young are expected to become susceptible to ailments in colder temperatures.The Reuters report said the WHO spokesperson did not have exact figures on the number of children who have already succumbed to the difficult conditions, but Harris spoke about “wards filled with tiny little children”.Measles cases have been witnessing a spike in Afghanistan, with WHO data showing as many as 24,000 clinical cases had so far been reported.Food crisis has been a major challenge in Afghanistan since the Sunni Pashtun group swept into power on August 15, with a recent report mentioning that Afghans are selling their children to procure food items for survival. Released by the Canada-based think-tank International Forum for Rights and Security (IFFRAS), the report added that 95 per cent of Afghans lack access to adequate food, while half of the country’s population are expected to face acute hunger levels as winter sets in. The prediction by the WHO and IFFRAS come at a time when the Taliban government in Afghanistan is calling for unfreezing its government’s reserves and loans.The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the Global Fund have said they have paid $8million for 23,500 health workers in as many as 31 provinces in Afghanistan over the previous month.“Global Fund took the financial risk; we took the implementation risk to make these payments happen,” UNDP’s regional director for Asia and the Pacific, Kanni Wignaraja said.Last month, the European Union (EU) during its first face-to-face talks with the Sunni Pashtun group, pledged one billion euros ($1.2 billion) in aid for Afghanistan. However, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen clarified that the assistance was “direct support” for Afghans and would be given to international organisations working for the cause on the ground, and not to the ruling Taliban regime.The EU does not recognise the Taliban dispensation in Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/1-million-afghan-children-at-risk-of-dying-by-year-end-amid-food-crisis-who-101636737033919.html
12-11-2021||World||Blinken says Qatar to act as US diplomatic representative in Afghanistan||The United States and Qatar signed an accord on Friday for Qatar to represent US diplomatic interests in Afghanistan, an important signal of possible future direct engagement between Washington and the Taliban after two decades of war.US secretary of state Antony Blinken and his Qatari counterpart, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani, signed the agreement making Qatar the US "protecting power" in Afghanistan at a State Department ceremony after holding talks."Qatar will establish a US interest section within its embassy in Afghanistan to provide certain consular services and monitor the condition and security of US diplomatic facilities in Afghanistan," Blinken said.The move will further strengthen relations between Washington and the small, wealthy Gulf monarchy, which forged close ties with the Taliban by hosting the militants' only official office outside Afghanistan and by playing a key role in the talks that led to the 2020 deal for the US troop pullout this year.The agreement comes as the United States and other Western countries grapple with how to engage with the hardline Islamists after they took over Afghanistan in a lightning advance in August as US-led forces were completing their pullout.The United States and other Western countries shut their embassies and withdrew their diplomats as the Taliban seized Kabul, following which the militants declared an interim government whose top members are under US and UN sanctions.The United States, European countries and others are reluctant to formally recognize the Pashtun-dominated Taliban, accusing them of backtracking on pledges of political and ethnic inclusivity and to uphold the rights of women and minorities.But with winter approaching, many governments realize they need to engage more to prevent the deeply impoverished country from plunging into a humanitarian catastrophe.According to the new agreement, which comes into effect on December 31, Qatar will dedicate certain staff from its embassy in Afghanistan to a US Interests Section and will coordinate closely with US State Department and with US mission in Doha.A senior State Department official said the United States would also continue its engagement with the Taliban's political office in the Qatari capital, Doha.Consular assistance may include accepting passport applications, offering notarial services for documentation, providing information, and helping in emergencies, the US official said on condition of anonymity."The protecting power arrangement envisions that Qatar would facilitate any formal communication between the United States and Afghanistan," the senior US official said.Second AgreementMillions of Afghans face growing hunger amid soaring food prices, a drought and an economy in freefall, fueled by a hard cash shortage, sanctions on Taliban leaders and the suspension of financial aid.The Taliban victory saw the billions of dollars in foreign aid that had kept the economy afloat abruptly switched off, with more than $9 billion in central bank reserves frozen outside the country.In a second agreement with Washington, Qatar will continue to temporarily host up to 8,000 at-risk Afghans who have applied for special immigrant visas (SIV) and their eligible family members, the US official said."SIV applicants will be housed at Camp As Sayliyah and al-Udeid Air Base," the official said.At a press conference after signing the accords, Blinken praised Qatar for aiding ongoing evacuations of American citizens, green cards holders and SIV applicants.Qatar, he said, allowed to transit through Doha roughly half of the 124,000 people evacuated from Afghanistan since August in the hastily arranged and chaotic US evacuation operation.Since then, Qatar has funded at least 15 evacuation flights by Qatar Airways of hundreds of US citizens and others and will continue providing charter flights for SIV holders and other Afghans, he said.Tens of thousands of Afghans potentially at risk of Taliban retribution for aiding the United States and its allies or working for foreign organizations remain in Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/blinken-says-qatar-to-act-as-us-diplomatic-representative-in-afghanistan-101636736165795.html

Assange and Moris, a South Africa-born lawyer, have two young sons: Gabriel, 4, and Max, 2.“I am relieved that reason prevailed, and I hope there will be no further interference with our marriage,” Moris said.In January, a judge refused a US request to extradite Assange, but he remains in prison while a higher court considers the US government's appeal.Assange and Moris made their relationship public in April 2020 and had applied to prison authorities for permission to wed.They threatened legal action against the prison governor and Justice Secretary Dominic Raab, accusing them of trying to prevent the marriage from taking place.“Mr. Assange’s application was received, considered and processed in the usual way by the prison governor, as for any other prisoner,” the Prison Service said Thursday.No date has yet been set for the wedding.US prosecutors have indicted Assange on 17 espionage charges and one charge of computer misuse over WikiLeaks’ publication of thousands of leaked military and diplomatic documents a decade ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/julian-assange-given-permission-to-marry-partner-stella-moris-in-prison-101636718552078.html

A newspaper reader, in a letter to The Straits Times on Wednesday, had combed through the Infectious Diseases (Mass Gathering Testing for Coronavirus Disease 2019) Regulations 2021.A person is considered fully vaccinated 14 days after the second dose.The reader has asked whether this meant that the government intends for all Singapore residents to take booster shots to be considered fully vaccinated after a year, and that when the efficacy of the booster jab diminishes, residents would have to take an additional booster to maintain their fully vaccinated status.Another question was that when the efficacy of the booster vaccine diminishes, would residents have to take another booster to maintain their fully vaccinated status.In its response, the ministry said it regularly reviews the evidence from studies in Singapore and abroad on the protection provided by the Covid-19 vaccines.“As these studies are ongoing, when enacting the regulations earlier, we had in the interim specified a duration of 365 days... to allow persons who have completed the primary series of their vaccinations to be exempted from vaccination-differentiated safe management measures,” TODAY newspaper quoted the ministry as saying.Exemption from these measures mean that fully vaccinated individuals are allowed to dine in at food and beverage establishments and enter malls and large standalone stores, while those who are unvaccinated cannot.As more data becomes available, including on the increase in protection provided by booster doses, the Expert Committee on Covid-19 Vaccination (EC19V) will study the evidence and make its recommendations and the Ministry will review the stipulated time frame.Both (mRNA) Covid-19 vaccines and non-mRna vaccines approved here are subject to the interim 365-day validity date under the law.The ministry said that while two doses of the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) Covid-19 vaccines provide excellent protection against severe disease, there will be “waning protection against infection”.“Hence MOH (the Ministry of Health) recommends all eligible vaccinated persons to receive their booster doses to improve their protection against Covid-19 infection and reduce transmission,” the ministry said.In Singapore, the Covid-19 vaccines were rolled out in late December last year, with healthcare workers being the first to receive them. They were then progressively given to more frontline workers and then to the elderly in January this year, before being offered to other groups.Meanwhile, the Singapore Prison Service (SPS) said 169 inmates across all prison facilities were Covid-19 positive as of November 10.Indian-origin Malaysian drug trafficker Nagaenthran K Dharmalingam, who is facing execution, was granted a stay of his execution by a three-judge Court of Appeal after he tested positive for Covid-19.Also, five lions have tested positive for COVID-19 at the Singapore zoo.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-to-review-time-frame-for-fully-vaccinated-status-against-covid-101636713048696.html
12-11-2021||World||Film festival in Canada honours filmmaker Ali Kazimi with retrospective||An Indo-Canadian filmmaker has been honoured with a retrospective at Canada’s largest film festival dedicated to Asian cinema.Toronto-based Ali Kazimi is being featured as the Canadian Artist Spotlight for the 25th anniversary edition of the Reel Asian International Film Festival, which showcases cinema from Asia and from the Asian diaspora.The 10-day film festival, which began on Thursday, is screening three of Ali Kazimi’s documentaries including Continuous Journey, which focuses upon the infamous Komagata Maru incident when the ship of that name, carrying 376 passengers from India, was denied landing in Vancouver due to a colonial regulation that disallowed those who had not arrived directly from their boarding point. Also part of the package is Shooting Indians, a portrait of self-described urban Iroquois photographer Jeffrey Thomas and Random Acts of Legacy, which documents life of a Chinese family in Chicago between 1936 and 1951 through the lens of race using footage from their home movies.Kazimi said he felt “truly honoured” at being chosen for the retrospective, particularly since he had never had such a special presentation of his films in Canada. And the location of the film festival being Toronto, where he lives, made it a “wonderful” experience. Retrospectives of his films have previously taken place at the Mumbai International Film Festival and the Pacific Film Archives/Berkeley Art Museum. But being in Toronto was special. “It’s important to have a platform to bring my body of work in a cohesive manner,” said Ali Kazimi. His films have also featured at major film festivals including the Toronto International Film Festival and Hot Docs, North America’s largest documentary festival.Ali Kazimi, 60, was born in Hyderabad, grew up in New Delhi, and moved to Canada in 1983. Over the past two decades he has also taught film and mentored filmmakers, as an Associate Professor at the Department of Cinema and Media Arts at York University in Toronto.He also received the Canadian Governor General’s Award for Lifetime Achievement in Visual and Media Arts in 2019.Kazimi’s career has been marked with serendipitous discoveries of footage, some leading to projects. As he said, “My films find me rather than the other way around. It’s never been an easy process, but it’s been very rewarding.” The Reel Asian accolade is just the latest of those rewards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/film-festival-in-canada-honours-filmmaker-ali-kazimi-with-retrospective-101636712563912.html

There are casualties and fatalities," a Taliban official told AFP."So far three killed, 15 wounded," a doctor at the local hospital told AFP.The Afghan branch of the Islamic State group, which first emerged in Nangarhar in 2015, has claimed responsibility for a series of bloody attacks in Afghanistan since the Taliban's return to power.One of the latest, in early November, saw IS fighters raid the Kabul National Military Hospital, killing at least 19 people and injuring more than 50.More than 120 people were killed in IS attacks earlier this year on two mosques popular with the ethnic minority Hazara community.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/blast-at-mosque-in-afghanistan-s-nangarhar-province-taliban-official-101636711703983.html
12-11-2021||World||China’s Communist Party hails Xi Jinping as ‘helmsman’||President Xi Jinping is the country’s “helmsman” whose “core leadership” is of crucial importance for China’s rejuvenation, an official from the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) said on Friday.“By resolutely upholding Xi Jinping’s core position on the Central Committee and in the Party as a whole, the Chinese people now have a backbone and the huge ship named ‘the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation’ has a helmsman,” said Jiang Jinquan, an official from CPC central committee’s policy research office.A key CPC conclave on Thursday adopted a “historical resolution” that highlighted its achievements under Xi’s leadership since 2012 and elevated the Chinese leader’s stature, cementing his power ahead of next year’s once-in-decade party congress.The CPC further explained the importance of the four-day plenum and Xi’s role at a press conference on Friday.By defining the guiding role of ‘Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era’, Jiang said, “the CPC will be able to stick to the right direction and deal with risks and challenges so as to lead the people to continuously strive for the bright prospects of great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation”.The term “helmsman” was once reserved for the founder of modern China, Mao Zedong.However, it is now used to describe Xi, to emphasise his importance in the current Chinese political and social framework.It was used, for example, in 2020, at the end of a similar four-day CPC plenum in Beijing.A communique issued after the 2020 plenum noted, “Experience has repeatedly indicated that with comrade Xi Jinping as the core of the “central party authorities” and with the core of the party being the “navigator and helmsman”. “We can definitely win over various difficulties and impediments on the road ahead,” it said.On Thursday, the central committee of China’s ruling party declared Xi’s ideology the “essence of Chinese culture”, adding it was “of decisive significance” for “the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation”.Xi Jinping is widely expected to pursue a third five-year term as party general secretary at the 2022 party congress.“The resolution is a guiding piece of literature of Marxism, a political declaration the CPC members made to bear in mind the party’s founding mission and uphold and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics, as well as an action guide for achieving the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation,” said Qu Qingshan, head of the institute of party history and literature of the CPC central committee .At Friday’s press conference, the CPC members also took the opportunity to criticise the democracy summit announced by US President Joe Biden for next month, calling it a “farce”. It is undemocratic to measure different political systems in the world using “a single ruler” and to look at mankind’s different political civilisations from “a monotonous perspective”, said Jiang.“The democracy summit to be held by the United States is a farce in the face of the growing pile of democratic issues in some Western countries, Jiang said at the press conference, according to state-run China Daily newspaper. Washington’s attempt to divide the world into two or several groups will not succeed, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-communist-party-hails-xi-jinping-as-helmsman-101636709323390.html
12-11-2021||World||Xi prepares for third term, clock ticks on Taiwan||With the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China passing the historical resolution on Thursday, President Xi Jinping has joined the pantheon of Communist gods along with party founder Mao Zedong and reformer Deng Xiaoping and paves way for his third term as paramount leader next autumn.While the historical resolution sings paean for “Xi Jinping” thought, it glosses over the humongous turmoil, devastation and political upheavals of the 1950s, 60s and 70s during the Mao era. Unlike the 1981 resolution under Deng that pointed to mistakes during Mao’s cultural revolution, the 2021 resolution simply refers to the period as one of socialist revolution and construction. The clout of President Xi is quite evident as he is mentioned 17 times in the historical resolution as compared to Mao, who features seven times and economic reformer Deng mere five times.Albeit the resolution passed during the centennial celebration talks about the Communist Party’s goal of turning China into a “great modern socialist country” by 2049, the centennial of the People’s Republic, it is quite evident that President Xi is in a hurry to consolidate China with Taiwan a priority after integration of Hong Kong. The Peoples’ Liberation Army (PLA), which is headed by President Xi, made its intentions quite clear after nearly 56 Chinese fighters and bombers violated the south-western air defence identification zone of Taiwan on October 4. The PLA is already testing its long-range missiles on mock-up targets of American aircraft carriers and destroyers in the Taklamakan desert and the PLA navy is aggressive in the South China Sea and larger Indo-Pacific with its propaganda machinery working at full steam.Chinese Communist Party watchers believe that Beijing will translate the “One China” policy from mere words to reality sooner than later as it sees an opportunity in perceived weak US leadership, fractured European Union and suppliant ASEAN countries. The perception of weak US leadership has been strengthened by the disastrous withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan with rag-tag black turban and sandal-wearing militia getting a carte blanche from Washington in Doha and once a celebrated US ally, Pakistan, cheering the Taliban capture of Kabul.That the US is not the military power which it used to be was evident when White House officials hurriedly added a caveat of no change in American “One China” policy after President Joe Biden publicly announced that theUS would militarily defend Taiwan against China military action. The Biden leadership will further weaken politically if Democrats lose the Congress to Republicans next year and this seems to be the upcoming reality as poll numbers for the President dive.The argument that the AUKUS pact will act as a deterrence to Chinese aggression does not work as it will take at least a decade for Australia to train its crew on nuclear-powered submarines and another to acquire them and that too on highly optimistic estimates. Just like the PLA Navy has realised how tricky is naval aviation, operating nuclear submarines even with conventional weapons is another dimension, which the Australians will also come to know.While China under President Xi will ratchet pressure on Taiwan in the coming months, it is will tighten its grip on the Af-Pak region for its energy security through client state Pakistan. Already there is a talk of China building a $15 billion oil pipeline from Gwadar to Xinjiang to circumvent the comparatively arduous Malacca Straits with the Middle-East crude oil being refined at the Baluchistan port. With the Chinese also looking at laying an optical fibre network to link Pakistani villages on both sides of the CPEC corridor, Beijing will have a vice-like grip on Islamabad and consequently put more pressure on India. Transportation of oil through Gwadar will not only strengthen Chinese energy security but also reduce the global leverage of Malacca and other ingress routes to the South China Sea.Even as China is committed to implementing Comrade Xi Jinping’s new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics, the world is already experiencing the rise of aggressive China with its neighbours feeling the heat. While Beijing seems to be in relentless pursuit of its 2049 goals, its immediate adversaries like Japan are still mulling over junking its pacifist doctrine with Russia still viewing the world through bygone cold war calculus. The clock is already ticking on Taiwan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-prepares-for-third-term-clock-ticks-on-taiwan-101636693589895.html
12-11-2021||World||Myanmar court sentences US journalist to 11 years in jail||A court in military-ruled Myanmar on Friday sentenced detained US journalist Danny Fenster to 11 years in prison after finding him guilty on several charges including incitement for allegedly spreading false or inflammatory information.Fenster, the managing editor of the online magazine Frontier Myanmar, was also found guilty of contacting illegal organizations and violating visa regulations, lawyer Than Zaw Aung said.Fenster has been detained since May. He still faces two additional charges in a different court for allegedly violating the counterterrorism law and a statute covering treason and sedition.Fenster was detained at Yangon International Airport on May 24 as he was about to board a flight to go to the Detroit area in the United States to see his family.He is the only foreign journalist to be convicted of a serious crime since the army seized power in February, ousting the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi.The military-installed government has cracked down hard on press freedom, shutting virtually all critical outlets and arresting about 100 journalists, roughly 30 of whom remain in jail. Some of the closed outlets have continued operating without a license, publishing online as their staff members dodge arrest.The army takeover was met by widespread peaceful protests that were put down with lethal force. The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners has detailed the deaths of more than 1,200 civilians, in addition to about 10,000 arrests. Armed resistance has since spread, and UN experts and others observers fear the incipient insurgency can slide into civil war.Fenster’s next challenge is the two additional charges that his lawyer said Monday had been filed in a different court in Yangon.Than Zaw Aung said one of the new charges comes under a section of the Counterterrorism Act that is punishable by from 10 years to life in prison. The military-installed government has said it would apply the law harshly in cases involving opposition organizations it has deemed to be “terrorist.”The other charge under the penal code is usually referred to as treason or sedition and carries a penalty of seven to 20 years’ imprisonment.The hearings on the original three charges have been held at the court in Yangon’s Insein Prison, where Fenster is jailed. They were closed to the press and the public. Accounts of the proceedings have come from Fenster’s lawyer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-court-sentences-us-journalist-to-11-years-in-jail-101636696590322.html
12-11-2021||World||Unvaccinated people lead Covid 4th wave in Germany: Report||The exponential surge in Covid-19 cases in Germany is mostly led by unvaccinated people, multiple reports have said as the country is reeling under a new wave of the pandemic. According to a report by the New York Times, Covid-19 patients in Germany have tripled in recent weeks. Out of this, nearly half of them are on ventilators and "every single one of them is unvaccinated," it reported.The country on Thursday saw a jump of more than 50,000 cases in a single day for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic in 2020. Cases surged by a record 50,196 and the seven-day incidence rate per 100,000 people climbed to 249.1, according to the latest daily data from the RKI public-health institute. Deaths rose by 235 to a total of 97,198.For Germany, it is unprecedented as it was one of the few countries that managed to keep the virus under control with its widespread testing and treatment.However, with the country battling a political limbo, a combination of factors including the slow rollout of vaccines have led to the surge in daily Covid cases.While many of the unvaccinated are in age groups that are statistically likely to experience less severe cases of Covid-19, they can pass the virus to older people with weaker immune systems, who can then end up in intensive care even with vaccination.On Thursday, the outgoing chancellor Angela Merkel said, people who are still not vaccinated as the fourth wave of the coronavirus pandemic takes hold in Germany must understand they have a duty to the rest of society to protect others.Olaf Scholz, who aims to succeed Merkel early next month, has meanwhile asked the country to be "winter-proofed" against the disease, and it will be mostly up to state governments to decide which measures and restrictions are needed in their region.She also asserted that "Many fewer vaccinated people are affected by the infection than those who haven’t been inoculated."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unvaccinated-people-lead-covid-4th-wave-in-germany-report-101636690003241.html
12-11-2021||World||Hong Kong jails ‘Captain America’ protester, who wielded the superhero's shield||A Hong Kong pro-democracy activist, who was dubbed ‘Captain America 2.0’ for wielding the superhero's shield at protests, was jailed on Thursday for nearly six years under the country's stringent national security law after a court ruled that he chanted a banned slogan and promoted independence from China. The development comes at a time when Hong Kong authorities are multiplying their crackdown on pro-democracy and anti-China protests using the sweeping security law drafted by Beijing to set stark limits on free speech.Ma Chun-man, 31, known locally as Captain America 2.0 for the Marvel character he’d sometimes dressed as while protesting, was sentenced to five years and nine months in prison for incitement to secession. The district court ruled last month that his use of slogans, including “liberate Hong Kong, the revolution of our times” violated the vaguely worded security law. Chun-man, however, had pleaded not guilty to the charges he faced.The judge, while handing down the sentence on Thursday, said it didn't matter whether the accused, Ma Chun-man, had used violence or attacked law and order officers or not. What matters is that the accused had performed the action (chanting the slogan) with an intention to “incite others to secession”, the judge noted.For context, Hong Kong has banned the “liberate” slogan under the China-imposed national security law, despite the chant being reverberated and displayed on flags by tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of protesters in the city in recent years.The sentence for Ma’s non-violent offense is on par with some of the longest verdicts handed down for rioting during the mass anti-government unrest of 2019. A man who joined a stick-wielding mob that attacked protesters and commuters in one suburb was sentenced in July to seven years in prison, while a construction worker who participated in an airport riot where he assaulted a mainland Chinese journalist was jailed in January for 5.5 years. (With inputs from Bloomberg)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-jails-captain-america-protester-who-wielded-the-superhero-s-shield-101636683260267.html

US to give automatic work authorisation permits||The United States has agreed to provide automatic work authorisation permits to the spouses of H-1B visa holders, a decision which will benefit thousands of Indian-American women. The Americal Immigration Lawyers' Association filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of immigrant spouses in which this settlement has been reached by the Department of Homeland Security, PTI reported. "This (H-4 visa holders) is a group that always met the regulatory test for automatic extension of EADs (employment authorisation documents), but the agency previously prohibited them from that benefit and forced them to wait for reauthorisation. People were suffering. They were losing their high-paying jobs for absolutely no legitimate reason causing harm to them and US businesses," Jon Wasden from the association said. "Although this is a giant achievement, the parties' agreement will further result in a massive change in position for the USCIS, which now recognises that L-2 spouses enjoy automatic work authorisation incident to status, meaning these spouses of executive and managers will no longer have to apply for employment authorisation prior to working in the United States," the association said. What this means for IndiaSpouses of H-1B and L-2 visa holders will no longer have to apply for work authorisation and need an employment authorisation document as proof in order to work in the United States.For H-4 spouses who have lawful status and merely need to renew their employment authorisation, they will now enjoy an automatic extension of their authorisation for 180 days after expiration should the agency fail to process their timely-filed applications, the settlement says. Dependents of H-1B visa holders are issued H-4 visas.The lawsuit sought to remove the bottlenecks in the policies that caused many spouses job loss as it may take two years to process the applications for the spouses.As Forbes reported, one of the original plaintiffs in the suit was Divya Jayaraj who came to America as an international student and returned as the spouse of an H-1B visa holder. She worked in the health care sector. “Concurrent with her spouse’s extension, on August 25, 2020, she filed applications to extend her H-4 status on Form I-539 and EAD on Form I-765,” according to the lawsuit which claimed that Divya lost her job "because of agency inaction."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/good-news-for-spouses-of-h-1b-visa-holders-us-to-give-automatic-work-authorisation-permits-101636686711201.html
12-11-2021||World||US Congress report says Pakistan playing ‘active and disruptive’ role in Afghanistan||A US Congress report on Afghanistan has accused Pakistan of playing ‘active, disruptive and destabilising’ role in Afghan affairs, including through what it described as Pakistan's support to the Taliban. “Many observers see the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan as a substantiative triumph for Pakistan, bolstering its influence in Afghanistan, and advancing its decades-long efforts to limit India’s influence there,” the bipartisan Congressional Research Service (CRS) report, prepared by independent subject area experts, further said, adding that despite some ‘favourable’ comments top Pakistani officials, the regime’s power grab in the neighbouring war-torn nation may present challenges and complications for Islamabad.Also Read | Afghanistan: The path aheadThe CRS report, which does not represent the official view of the US Congress and is prepared for lawmakers to make informed decisions on issues of interest, further warned that the United States could find itself ‘isolated’ if countries such as Pakistan, Russia, China, or Washington’s allies like Qatar, move towards greater acceptance of the Taliban. “This would weaken America’s leverage, and give the Taliban greater opportunities to evade or counter US pressure,” it said.Also Read | Humanitarian aid for Afghanistan being held up by lack of unimpeded access: IndiaThe document also warned of a ‘difficult but familiar’ challenge for US lawmakers in the event of acceptance of the current Afghan dispensation. “A less oppositional approach could allow us access to, and perhaps influence over, the group and events in Afghanistan. Engagement with a Taliban government which acts in support of some US interests and against others could compel policymakers to weigh and prioritise those interests, posing a difficult challenge, as it is a government which is neither governing democratically nor protecting human rights,” the report said.Also Read | Taliban minister Muttaqi in Islamabad for talks as Pak hosts meet on AfghanistanAny ‘punitive’ approach by the Joe Biden administration could further worsen the already dire humanitarian conditions in Afghanistan, in addition to creating ‘uncertain’ implications for the Taliban, it also said.The Taliban seized power in Afghanistan for a second time, on August 15, in the backdrop of the withdrawal of American forces which began on May 1. The pull-out, which ended on August 30, a day before a self-imposed deadline to do so, brought to an end America’s near 20-year-long military presence in that country.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-congress-report-says-pakistan-playing-active-and-disruptive-role-in-afghanistan-101636684790347.html
12-11-2021||World||McDonald's CEO faces growing criticism after gun victim text||The CEO of McDonald's is facing increasing criticism and calls for resignation following text messages he sent to Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot where he seemed to blame the deaths of two Black and Latino children killed in gun violence on their parents.McDonald's President and CEO Chris Kempczinski sent texts to Lightfoot in April after meeting with her and referred to shootings that killed two children earlier this year: 7-year-old Jaslyn Adams, a Black girl who was shot in a McDonald's drive-thru lane and 13-year-old Adam Toledo, a Latino boy who was shot by Chicago police."With both, the parents failed those kids which I know is something you can't say. Even harder to fix," Kempczinski wrote.The exchange was made public on social media late last month following a Freedom of Information Act request from Michael Kessler, an American activist living in Canada, who said he was looking into an Oregon police matter and working with Chicago-based transparency group Lucy Parsons Lab.Chicago organisations have been protesting for days, saying the messages were racist, ignorant and out-of-touch. Jaslyn Adams' mother has demanded an apology from the CEO, who is white. And US Rep. Bobby Rush of Illinois called this week for Kempczinski to be removed."This is a deplorable message, and one that is completely unacceptable for the CEO of a powerful multinational corporation — let alone a corporation that markets aggressively to communities of colour and publicly proclaims that Black lives matter' — to espouse," the Chicago Democrat said in a statement Wednesday.A coalition of community groups amplified their demand for Kempczinski to resign Thursday by protesting outside the McDonald's where Jaslyn Adams was killed. The coalition, which called attention to other racial discrimination complaints the company has faced, called on the fast-food giant to create a USD 200 million fund over four years to improve life in Chicago, among other things. The group included immigrant rights activists, labour groups and churches.Earlier this month, Kempczinski sent a note to McDonald's corporate employees in the US, saying he was thinking through his "lens as a parent and reacted viscerally," according to The Chicago Tribune."But I have not walked in the shoes of Adam's or Jaslyn's family and so many others who are facing a very different reality," he said. "Not taking the time to think about this from their viewpoint was wrong, and lacked the empathy and compassion I feel for these families. This is a lesson that I will carry with me."McDonald's has declined to comment to reporters. A message left Thursday for a spokesperson by the Associated Press was not immediately returned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mcdonalds-ceo-faces-growing-criticism-after-gun-victim-text-101636678644913.html
12-11-2021||World||SpaceX capsule with crew of four docks with International Space Station||A SpaceX capsule carrying four astronauts docked with the International Space Station on Thursday, kicking off a six-month stay on the orbiting outpost.This mission known as Crew-3 is part of Nasa's multibillion-dollar partnership with Elon Musk's space company, signed after the Space Shuttle program ended in 2011 and aimed at restoring US capacity to carry out human spaceflight, rather than depend on Russia for links to the ISS.The ISS had been operating with just one Nasa astronaut in the US segment to welcome the incoming crew after the astronauts of the earlier Crew-2 mission splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico on Sunday.Crew-3's Raja Chari, Kayla Barron and Tom Marshburn of the United States and Matthias Maurer of Germany traveled to space aboard a Crew Dragon capsule fixed to a Falcon 9 rocket from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. They blasted off late Wednesday.The spaceship, called Endurance, docked with the ISS around 7:10 pm Thursday (0010 GMT Friday).The flight was initially postponed from October 31, first for weather, then a "minor medical issue" affecting one of the crew. Nasa did not say who it was but said it was not Covid-related.Chari, a US Air Force colonel, is commanding the mission and making his first trip to space, along with Barron and Maurer.Marshburn, a medical doctor, flew aboard a Space Shuttle in 2009 and a Russian Soyuz spacecraft in a mission from 2012-13.Barron, who along with Chari was selected for the Nasa astronaut corps in 2017, the most recent recruitment, previously served as a submarine warfare officer for the Navy, while Maurer, a materials science engineer, is the 12th German to go into space.The quartet will spend six months on the orbital outpost and conduct research to help inform future deep space exploration and benefit life on Earth.Scientific highlights of the mission include an experiment to grow plants in space without soil or other growth media, and another to build optical fibers in microgravity, which prior research has suggested will be superior in quality to those made on Earth.The Crew-3 astronauts will also conduct spacewalks to complete an upgrade of the station's solar panels and will be present for two tourism missions, including Japanese visitors aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft at the end of the year and the Space-X Axiom crew, set for launch in February 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spacex-capsule-with-crew-of-four-docks-with-international-space-station-101636682246249.html

The House panel was to receive its first batch on Friday.Overall the House has requested more than 770 pages of documents including records from Trump's top aides and memos to his press secretary.Among the records are documents from Trump's former chief of staff Mark Meadows, his former senior advisor Stephen Miller and his former deputy counsel Patrick Philbin.Trump had also hoped to block the release of the White House Daily Diary – a record of his activities, trips, briefings, and phone calls.Another trove of documents Trump does not want Congress to see includes memos to his former press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, a handwritten note on the January 6 events, and a draft text of his speech at the “Save America” rally. Delivered just prior to the attack, Trump in that address urged followers to “fight like hell” in defense of his false claim that the election was stolen from him.Earlier this week, the House committee issued subpoenas to top Trump aides who allegedly plotted to overturn his defeat in a “war room” at a luxury Washington hotel as well as for some of his most senior lieutenants, including McEnany and Miller.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-court-grants-trump-s-request-to-halt-release-of-white-house-documents-101636677497950.html
12-11-2021||World||Students from India face lots of challenges in Canada: Experts||As Canada heads towards a record intake of students from India this year, a leading immigration lawyer and charity groups are warning of the challenges these newcomers face on arrival leading to suicides and even prostitution as they come under pressure in a foreign land.According to data from Immigration Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), 156,171 study permits were given to students from India, almost double the number from 2020, which was at 76,149, a substantial drop due to the Covid-19 pandemic and restrictions on travel. However, the surge this year could lead to a new record high in Indian students reaching Canadian universities and colleges, as it’s on course to eclipse the previous mark of 174,687 in 2019.International students overall make for an industry that adds between 7 billion and 8 billion Canadian dollars each year to the Canadian higher education sector, resulting in serious recruitment activity, particularly in states like Punjab. In a recent report tracking that phenomenon and its extreme downside, the Canadian outlet Globe and Mail noted, “Bringing Indian students to Canada has become a lucrative business spanning two continents.”The dark side of these burgeoning numbers is the mental health problems faced by these students, as families take on enormous debt to send their children abroad. The amount charged by education institutions in Canada are usually four times the approximately 7,000 Canadian dollars figure for domestic students. Adding to the burden are expenses for accommodation and food, among other items.The outlet The Pointer reported that a single funeral home in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) recorded five dead bodies of Indian students each month.Ravi Jain, founder of Canadian Immigration Lawyers’ Association, said, “Consultants in India are painting a rosy picture and then there’s a tragic side”.There’s tremendous pressure on these students to recoup the investments by their parents, and often unable to do so, they turn to drugs, leading to overdoses, suicide, and even prostitution.Kamal Bhardwaj, proprietor of the Lotus Funeral and Cremation Centre in Toronto, is seeing this regularly, as he said they are handling corpses of five to six students each month. They are not privy to the cause of death, but some bodies turn up with ligature marks, indicating possible suicide and others bear signs of overdose. “There’s been an increase in the number of young people dying,” he told the Hindustan Times.In fact, that has led him to partner with two others to found a charity serving these students. Called Sunoh, it offers counselling, including for those contemplating suicide. And it organises webinars before the students leave India so as to provide them with a realistic picture of life in Canada and the hardships it entails. A partner organisation recently had half-a-dozen young girls arrive in distress as they were pregnant. Bhardwaj felt this pointed to possible “human trafficking”.Montreal-based physician Shivendra Dwivedi has a similar initiative, called Sahyog, which also offers webinars and mental health counselling. He said, “These poor students are being exploited. It’s a racket. Recruiters are selling them an impossible dream.”He plans to approach Canada’s new Immigration Minister Sean Fraser for initiating urgently required reforms in the system.Jain, who practices with the Toronto-based firm Green & Spiegel and is also former chair of the Canadian Bar Association’s Immigration unit, said this problem is “widespread” and “it’s become more common. The community doesn’t really come out about it too much because there’s a lot of shame and embarrassment and of course the government doesn’t want to publicise it” because of the billions of dollars in revenue involved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/students-from-india-face-lots-of-challenges-in-canada-experts-101636635626516.html

These districts showed a decline in the prevalence of underweight children under 5-years of age between 2015-16 and 2019-20. Osmanabad, chosen as the aspirational district, led the way with a 12% decline. The percentage of underweight children went down from 44.5% to 32.5% across all districts in Maharashtra.Rubal Agarwal, commissioner, Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) said, “Osmanabad was one of the aspirational districts and due to our extra efforts on the same, as per the rules laid down by the central government for the aspirational district, we focused on that one district and took multiple steps like recruitment of staff, monitoring, nutritional schemes and now eventually, the district has given us some positive results. We are also working on bringing down the number of underweight kids in other districts as well.”As per the report prepared by ICDS as of June 2020, the top 12 districts which are doing well include Sangli, Osmanabad, Pune, Raigad, Buldhana, Nagpur, Kolhapur, Solapur, Akola, Mumbai city, Latur and Washim, while the districts that reported the highest number of underweight children are Nandurbar, Palghar, Yavatmal, Gondia, Gadchiroli, Nanded, Parbhani, Amravati, Mumbai suburban and Wardha.

12-11-2021||India||Right commission takes note of UP custodial death||The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has taken note of the custodial death of a 22-year-old in Kasganj, official familiar with development said on Saturday. The 22-year-old, identified as Altaf, was called for interrogation at the Kasganj police station in an abduction case and died on Tuesday evening, with his family members alleging that he was killed by police personnel. But the police claimed that Altaf, who was accused of eloping with a minor Hindu girl, had strangulated himself using a string from his jacket hood in the washroom of the police lock-up.The latest development comes after an RTI activist from Rampur, Danish Khan, filed a complaint with the NHRC on the matter.“The NHRC will investigate the incident that took place on Tuesday in Sadar Kotwali police station of Kasganj, before issuing notice in regard to a complaint lodged on Wednesday and registered on Thursday by NHRC as per the procedure prescribed,” stated Danish Khan. “The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) registered the case within 18 hours of filing of the complaint and will investigate the case on its merits before choosing to issue notices if deemed fit,” he said. Khan has challenged the police theory that Altaf, accused in a case of kidnapping, had committed suicide by hanging himself from the tap in the toilet of Sadar Kotwali police station of Kasganj on Tuesday. “Altaf was a man with a height of five and a half feet, so how could he commit suicide by hanging himself from a tap which was merely 2 feet above the ground, that too by using string from his jacket hood?” questioned Khan. “The circumstances show that Altaf was taken to the police station on the night of Monday, November 8 and was given third-degree torture by police and allegedly strangulated to death on Tuesday morning,” alleged Danish in his complaint to NHRC. The complaint lodged by Danish Khan with diary no. 18490/IN/2021 was registered on Thursday by NHRC under file No.333810/24/7/2021-AD.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/right-commission-takes-note-of-up-custodial-death-101636740286619.html
12-11-2021||India||Two cops injured in Maharashtra as protest turns violent||Two policemen were injured after incidents of stone-pelting by the mob during protests against recent violence in Tripura were reported in Nashik, Amravati and Nanded districts of Maharashtra on Friday, the police said.In Nanded, stones were pelted at police vans and two police personnel sustained injuries at Deglur Naka and Shivaji Nagar. Protestors were also seen torching shops and police vehicles in Malegaon and Amravati, following which the riot squad was called in to quell the protests. Shambhuraj Desai, minister of state for home, said that the police was directed to take strict action against the people responsible for instigating the violence. “I have spoken to senior police officials and have asked them to take strict action against people behind the violence. We have alerted the police administration against anti-social elements. The situation is under control,” he said.In Malegaon, a communally sensitive town in Nashik district, protestors, many of whom were Muslim, the police said, had gathered to protest against the treatment of the community in Tripura, where on October 26, a mosque, few houses and shops were reportedly vandalised by members of the right-wing group, Vishwa Hindu Parishad, during a rally.In Amravati, over 8,000 people gathered outside the district collector’s office to submit a memorandum demanding that atrocities against the minority community should be stopped, the PTI reported. When people were leaving after submitting the memorandum, stone-pelting took place at three places between Chitra Chowk and Cotton Market, a police official told PTI.In Amravati’s Kotwali police station, First Information Reports (FIR) has been lodged, naming hundreds of protesters. “No permission was given to the protest rally. We are registering a case against the protesters and action would be taken accordingly,” said Vikram Sali, DCP, Amravati.The protests that took place in other parts of the state, including Hingoli and Bhiwandi, stayed peaceful. Religious and political outfits had called for a peaceful bandh — to shut local establishments and shops — on Friday, following which memorandums were to be submitted to the district collectors of the various districts. The call was supported by the Congress, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Samajwadi Party in Bhiwandi.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is in opposition in the state, has demanded strict action. “Banking on the alleged incidents in Tripura, the protests staged in various parts of the state took a violent turn. The state government needs to take immediate steps to keep the situation under control,” the leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-cops-injured-in-maharashtra-as-protest-turns-violent-101636739327990.html
12-11-2021||India||Railways back to pre-Covid fares||Under pressure from passengers over hike in fares, the Railways on Friday issued an order to discontinue the ‘special’ tag for mail and express trains and revert to pre-pandemic ticket prices with immediate effect.Since the coronavirus-triggered lockdown was eased, the Railways has been running only special trains. It started with long-distance trains and now, even short-distance passenger services are being run as special trains with “slightly higher fares” to “discourage people from avoidable travels”.In a letter to the zonal railways on Friday, the Railway Board said trains will now be operated with their regular numbers and fares will revert to normal pre-Covid prices.Ticket prices of special trains and holiday special trains are marginally higher.“In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, all regular mail/express trains were being operated as MSPC (mail/express special) and HSP (holiday special). It has now been decided that the MSPC and HSP train services, included in the Working Time Table, 2021, shall be operated with regular numbers and with fares as applicable for the concerned classes of travel and type of train, as per the extant guidelines.“This issues with the concurrence of Passenger Marketing Directorate of Railway Board,” the order dated November 12 said.The order, however, did not specify when the zonal railways are required to revert to their pre-Covid regular services.“The zonal railways have been instructed. While the order is with immediate effect, the process will take a day or two,” a senior official said.“With this more than 1,700 trains will be restored in the next few days. The first digit will now not be zero as was in the case of special trains,” another official said.Officials, however, said curbs introduced in view of Covid such as temporary restrictions on concessions, bed rolls and meal services would continue to be in effect.With the operation of special trains and no concessions, the Railways’ revenue too has seen a substantial growth.

Much of the Ladakh region, where the town is located, remains snowbound. The winds are freezing. Cell phone connectivity is patchy. But government engineers and contractors have managed to connect 12 of the region’s 60 villages with 24x7 piped water connection in the cold desert under the flagship Jal Jeevan Mission, defying odds that have often left Leh behind in terms of modern infrastructure. The Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) scheme aims to connect every rural household in the country with a functional tapped water connection by 2024. Over 120 million households in India lacked access to clean water near their homes, the highest in the world in absolute numbers, according to a UN Water report in 2014. India has 189 million rural households, according to Census data, and the race to reach piped water to every household is on. As on November 10, nearly 84.7 million households have been provided with a functioning tapped water supply source. This is 44% of total rural households. The expanding network of piped drinking water is critical for health. Poor quality water is the main cause of diseases such as diarrhoea, the third leading cause of childhood mortality in the country, according to researchers Subitha Lakshminarayanan and Ramakrishnan Jayalakshmy, who work at Puduchery’s Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research and Indira Gandhi Medical College, respectively.Some regions such as Leh in the Union territory of Ladakh, stood out for their harsh terrain and geographical hurdles in the national programme to provided piped water. Besides, the region witnesses heightened military watch because of a simmering border dispute with China. In one such remote village called Dipling, ferrying men and equipment to locate a sustainable water source and lay the pipeline network was an arduous task as there was no motorable road, people involved in the project said. “Air sorties were used to move labour, engineers and equipment to this village,” says Bharat Lal, the additional secretary in the ministry of Jal Shakti, which oversees the programme. Along with high density polyethylene pipes, high-tech gadgets to locate water sources were also transported through air. Most villages lacked electricity, without which providing functional piped water supply is impossible since running motor equipment and monitoring sensors require power. Engineers in Leh built solar power units to solve the problem. “Solar power units mean the piped water facilities in the region are zero-carbon infrastructure. This makes it totally green,” district magistrate Skrikant Suse said. Villages along the Line of Actual Control along the India-China border are being covered on a priority, officials said. Of Leh’s 24,767 households, 5,425 households now have tapped water. The Union budget allotted ₹10,001 crore in 2019-20 for the national rural drinking water mission. In 2020-21, ₹11,500 crore was provided. The Union budget 2021-22 took this up to ₹50,000 crore for the mission. Overall, experts say a key challenge for the programme is to maintain sustainability of water supply sources. In previous attempts to provide drinking water supply, villages connected with water sources fell back to “no-water” status after a few years due to non-availability of water. Maintaining sustainability will require work on different aspects altogether. These include groundwater recharge, water conservation and, critically, cutting down the overuse of water in agriculture, which hogs 90% of available supply, mainly because farming isn’t efficient. “India has to bring down its farm water use to optimal levels for greater sustainability of groundwater, the most important source of water for human consumption,” says Alok Nath, a former water specialist at the Indian Council for Agricultural Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jal-jeevan-mission-12-leh-villages-get-tap-water-connection-101636739325381.html

The court’s question came in response to a hearing of petitions seeking quashing of cases against those who hosted Tablighi Jamaat attendees.Justice Mukta Gupta asked the Delhi police what offence was committed by Indian nationals who provided shelter to foreigners following the congregation as no bar was impose on persons residing at any particular place by the government. The court gave time to the Delhi police to respond to its queries when its counsel sought time to file a detailed status report, PTI report said.The judge further said the Jamaat attendees sought refuge before the lockdown was imposed in the wake of the pandemic and there were no allegations of them violating the orders restricting movement.“Suddenly when the lockdown is imposed, where does one go after that? What is the offence committed?... Is there any bar on Madhya Pradesh residents to stay in Delhi in any mosque, temple or gurudwara? They can stay wherever they want. Was there a notice that everybody will throw out whosoever was staying (with them)?” the judge said.“I have brought out the point. You will tell me where is the violation when there is no question of changing places at that time. I can understand they went out, that they violated the (lockdown) notification. When lockdown was imposed, there was no bar on anyone residing,” the court said.While some of the pleas for quashing of FIRs are by individuals who had provided shelter to the foreigners who had attended the event and could not travel owing to the subsequent pandemic-induced lockdown, others are by people like managing committee members or caretakers of different mosques who have been accused of providing housing facilities in masjids.FIRs were registered for the alleged commission of offences under Section 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), Section 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection) and other offences under the Indian Penal Code.Earlier, the court had asked Delhi Police to file a status report indicating the role of each accused and as well as the duration of their stay and whether the housing facility was given after or before the prohibitory orders issued by the authorities in view of the pandemic.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tablighi-jamaat-hc-wants-to-how-providing-refuge-during-lockdown-an-offence-101636735760153.html

During the meeting, officials will discuss a broad range of issues, including boundary disputes, security, and infrastructure-related matters like road, transport, industries, water and power, a statement by the ministry of home affairs (MHA) said on Friday. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has stressed the need to leverage cooperative and competitive federalism to achieve all-round growth. The home minister has given impetus to this vision of cooperative federalism to empower states and promote a better understanding between the Centre and states in policy framework, the statement said. The zonal councils provide a platform to foster such collaboration through a structured mechanism for dialogue and discussion continuously on the issues affecting two or more states or the Centre and states, in the spirit that strong states make a strong nation, it said. Shah has emphasized on using the platform of zonal council for dispute resolving and promoting cooperative federalism. Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy is the vice-chairman and the host. Other chief ministers from the states in the zone along with two ministers each are the members. The zonal councils take up issues involving the Centre and states and one or many states falling in the zone.

The National Testing Agency (NTA), which conducts the NEET exam for admission to undergraduate medical courses, earlier approached the Supreme Court challenging the high court direction to hold re-examination for the two candidates before the announcement of final results.“Due to loss of time, the respondents (candidates) could not answer all questions and we also appreciate the mental state of mind of young students while giving the examination….We feel sorry but we can’t do anything,” the bench said.The NEET-UG examination was conducted on September 12.The two candidates Vaishnavi Vijay Bhopale and Abhishek Shivaji Kapse had approached the high court stating that the invigilator accidentally dropped some test booklets while distribution and this resulted in their OMR sheets not corresponding to the Test booklet code. Under the NEET rules, this amounted to negative marking and the candidates lost precious time of the examination and ended up writing examination under stress.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta appearing for NTA informed the court that the concerns of the candidates were taken care of by the authorities as they were not given any negative marking despite the mismatch between OMR sheets and test booklets. However, he urged the court to set aside high court order as following the high court’s order, another petition was filed by a candidate seeking re-examination.Mehta said, “We have to work through invigilators and in future, there can be mistakes. If there is an order for re-examination, it will be an unending exercise as nearly 16 lakh students attempted this examination this year.”In its appeal before the top court, NTA through advocate Rupesh Kumar accepted the mistake of the invigilators but stated that the high court order restraining them from declaring results will hamper the admission process for undergraduate medical and dental courses.Although the Bombay high court held that its order shall not be treated as a precedent, the NTA apprehended that for future years, similar incidents could lead to cases in courts by students demanding re-examination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-cancels-retest-for-2-neet-aspirants-feels-sorry-over-goof-up-by-invigilator-101636733805097.html

12-11-2021||India||Former UP minister Gayatri Prajapati, 2 others get life term in gang-rape case||A special Lucknow court on Friday awarded life imprisonment to former Uttar Pradesh minister Gayatri Prajapati, and two others, Ashish Shukla and Ashok Tewari, in a gang-rape case, besides imposing a fine of ₹2 lakh each on the three convicted people. Special judge (MP/MLA court) Pawan Kumar Rai had convicted Prajapati, Shukla and Tewari on November 10 on charges of gang-raping a Chitrakoot-based woman and under sections of the POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act for attempting to rape her minor daughter. The court had absolved four others — Vikas Varma, Amrendra Singh “Pintu”, Chandrapal and Rupeshwar “Rupesh” — of all charges due to lack of evidence.All the three accused were present in court on Friday when the quantum of punishment was pronounced. On February 18, 2017, the woman from Chitrakoot in Uttar Pradesh had lodged an FIR against Prajapati and his six associates for allegedly gang-raping her and attempting to rape her 17-year-old daughter at his official residence in Gautampalli, Lucknow, when he was the mining minister and part of the Samajwadi Party government in Uttar Pradesh between 2015 and 2016.It was on the Supreme Court’s order that the Lucknow police had booked the former minister for rape and other serious charges, including sections of the POCSO Act. Prajapati was in jail since March 15, 2017. A Supreme Court bench headed by Justice AK Sikri on February 17, 2017, had ordered the Uttar Pradesh police to conduct an inquiry and submit an action taken report to the court in a sealed cover within eight weeks.The Supreme Court order had come on a petition filed by the survivor.Prajapati was sacked by then chief minister Akhilesh Yadav from his cabinet in 2016 during the family feud in the Samajwadi Party. He was later reinstated. The survivor’s lawyer had alleged in the Supreme Court that the woman was repeatedly raped between October 2014 and July 2016. The woman lodged a complaint only when the minister tried to outrage the modesty of her minor daughter, the survivor’s lawyer said. The survivor had complained that she was also raped when she met the former minister in 2013 for a mining contract. She also stated that Prajapati took obscene photos of her and raped her multiple times for three years by threatening to make the pictures public.When the BJP formed the government in the state, it constituted a SIT in May 2017 to probe the charges against the former minister. Prajapati is also facing a probe for irregularities in his ministry during his tenure as mining minister in the previous Samajwadi Party government. TIMELINE OF THE CASE:2013: The woman met Gayatri Prajapati at Ram Ghat, Chitrakoot, during Ganga Aarti. 2014 to 2016: She was raped multiple times.October 17, 2016: Survivor filed a complaint about gang rape with DGP, Uttar Pradesh Police.After no action was taken on her complaint, the survivor moved the Supreme Court seeking a FIR against the accused.February 17, 2017: Supreme Court orders UP Police to lodge FIR .July 18, 2017: Charges framed against Gayatri Prajapati, Ashok Tewari, Ashish Shukla and others.November 10, 2021: Special judge (MP/MLA) court convicts Gayatri Prajapati, Ashok Tewari and Ashish Shukla.The court acquits Vikas Varma, Amrendra Singh “Pintu”, Chandrapal and Rupeshwar “Rupesh” — of all charges due to lack of evidence.

12-11-2021||India||On Rahul's Hindutva analogy, BJP says ‘pathological hate’||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Sambit Patra on Friday said the Congress leadership had a "pathological hatred" for Hinduism and it was at the behest of senior party MP Rahul Gandhi that other veterans like Salman Khurshid, Shashi Tharoor and P Chidambaram targeted the religion.The BJP spokesperson’s latest attack came hours after Gandhi drew a distinction between Hinduism and Hindutva and spoke about how the latter was being used by the saffron camp, namely the BJP’s ideological founder the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), to spread hate.According to a PTI report, Patra said the former Congress president had a history of making critical comments about Hinduism and its culture. “It is in the character of the Congress and the Gandhi family to attack Hinduism at every opportunity,” he said.Also read | 'Exaggerated to him, not to me': Salman Khurshid on Ghulam Nabi Azad's take on HindutvaThe BJP leader further said that Congress leaders could use terms like ‘Hindu Pakistan’, ‘Hindu Taliban’ and ‘saffron terror’ only at the behest of Gandhi, whom he called the headmaster of the experimental lab."What they say is not a coincidence but an experiment. And the headmaster of this experimental lab is Rahul Gandhi.... There is a pathological hatred for Hinduism among Congress leaders, and they get traction for this from the Gandhi family," he said.Patra's attack came a day after the ruling party slammed the grand old party over Khurshid’s comparison of Hindutva with jihadist Islamis terror groups such as ISIS and Boko Haram in his latest book. He said it was clear that Khurshid also endorsed what Gandhi had been saying, Patra said, adding people of India would never forgive the Congress.Patra said seeking apology from Gandhi would be irrelevant as the latter had violated constitutional tenets with his remarks that spread "hate" in society.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-rahul-s-hindutva-analogy-bjp-says-pathological-hate-101636730561935.html
12-11-2021||India||Delhi riots: Court calls murder calculated attack, says witness hid behind drain||A Delhi court on Friday framed charges of murder, rioting and criminal conspiracy against four accused in the alleged killing of a man during the riots in northeast Delhi last year. The court said it was a “calculated attack”.Additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat further said a key witness in the case hid behind a wall behind a drain and saw the entire murder through the gap in the wall.The four men -- Anwar Hussain, Kasim, Shahrukh, and Khalid Ansari -- have been accused of mercilessly beating a man named Deepak to death near Ambedkar College on February 25, 2020. He died due to hemorrhagic shock, as per the post mortem report.The judge said, “By the manner of their mobilisation and intent as construed from their conduct, the said unlawful assembly can be said to have conducted itself for riots and other offences like murder of deceased Deepak, in prosecution of their common object. The conspiracy is also writ large by the calculated attack on the victim by the unlawful assembly."He said the most important witness in the case was one Sunil Kumar, who gave a complete picture of the incident and how the deceased was killed by the “armed Muslim mob consisting of accused persons”.According to the court, Sunil had seen, “on February 25, one Muslim unlawful assembly coming from Kardampuri Pulia and shouting Allah Ho Akbar was trying to cross the Pulia Gokulpur. The said armed unlawful assembly caught hold of Deepak who was mercilessly beaten.” He told the court that he hid behind a wall behind the drain and saw the entire murder through the gap in the wall. The eyewitness also identified all the four accused persons by their names.“Thus... the prosecution has been able to satisfy the Court that an unlawful assembly, including accused persons in the prosecution of their common object, had committed riots and hit the deceased Deepak with a deadly weapon causing his death,” the court said.The court framed charges under sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 302 (murder), read with sections 149 (unlawful assembly), and 120­B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).Delhi witnessed one of the worst communal clashes in its northeast region in February 2020, as massive violence was unleashed between supporters of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and those protesting against it. The clashes left at least 53 people dead and over 700 injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-riots-court-calls-murder-calculated-attack-says-witness-hid-behind-drain-101636725713307.html

Aur jo azaadi mili hai woh 2014 mai mili hai (That was not freedom, those were alms. We got real freedom in 2014.)”The Narendra Modi-led NDA government came to power at the Centre in 2014.Besides a strong backlash from the Congress and other opposition parties, a number of BJP leaders, including MP Varun Gandhi, have hit out at Kangana.

12-11-2021||India||Army agrees to grant PC to 72 women officers, spared contempt proceedings by top court||The Supreme Court on Friday spared the Army of contempt proceedings after it beat a hasty retreat on its decision to deny permanent commission to 72 women short service commission officers and agreed to grant permanent commission to all the officers who had qualified on merit and had no disciplinary or vigilance clearance pending against them.Out of the 72 women officers, 36 had filed contempt petitions in the top court that were taken up for hearing by a bench of Justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and AS Bopanna. These petitions were filed alleging that the Army was indulging in contempt of SC’s March 25 order by which it was held that all women short service commission officers (WSSCO) who qualify with 60% merit, are medically fit and have disciplinary and vigilance clearance are to be granted PC. 514 WSSCOs qualified on the 60% benchmark of which 442 secured PC while 72 were denied by the Selection Board that met in September 2020. One officer opted for premature release, leaving only 71 officers.On Friday, the Ministry of Defence presented an affidavit filed by Military Secretary to the Court stating that out of 36 officers, 21 had been granted permanent commission (PC) upon review and letters in this regard were issued to them on October 29. The case of one officer was under consideration for PC on a separate ground leaving a remainder of 14 who were under the rejected list. Of these, three were found to be medically unfit while in the case of 11 officers, there were serious objections raised.“If the service records of the relevant period of these 11 officers is to be taken as the basis, it raises question marks on their continuation in the force which is a relevant consideration adopted by Army to deny them,” said Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Sanjay Jain appearing for the Centre. The 11 officers had cleared the benchmark of 60% merit and were medically fit as well, thus being eligible for PC ility laid down in the Supreme Court’s March judgment and were found to be medically fit as well.The Court wished to know if these officers secured disciplinary and vigilance clearance as well to which ASG replied, “As of today, they have those clearances, but there are some weak points against them pertaining to the relevant period.”The Court remarked, “Army may be supreme in its own authority, but the Constitutional court is supreme in its own jurisdiction. We gave you a long rope and put you on guard that if you go beyond our order (of March), you will invite trouble. We are going to record a finding holding Army guilty of contempt.”To prevent this eventuality, ASG Jain along with senior advocate R Balasubramanian appearing for the Army took an hour’s concession from the Court to discuss with top authorities in the Army and Government on this issue. The bench stated, “You cannot get behind our judgment and seek review of our orders. Our directions are very clear. Do not deny these people on some remarks made at some point in the past.”Returning with instructions in the afternoon, ASG Jain told the Court that the 11 officers shall be granted PC within 10 days and all similarly placed WSSCOs who have not approached the Court in contempt petitions will also be given similar consideration. The Court accepted the fair stand of the Army and recorded the statement, granting three weeks’ time to consider grant of PC to the remaining similarly-placed officers.ASG Jain said, “The Army officers are keen to see this matter attains finality today. We will consider them with open heart and open mind.” Balasubramanian, who too played a crucial part in convincing the Army officers to arrive at a consensus, said, “Army is being thrown apart by this litigation. We want to bring an end to these proceedings.” He further pointed out that the Court should state in the order that in peculiar facts of this case as otherwise, it will open a flood of litigations by male short service commission officers who have been denied in the past on similar grounds.The Court disposed the contempt petitions and directed the Army authorities to deal with the complaints of two WSSCOs – Akansha Shrivastava and Himalini Pant – denied PC on medical grounds within a month. The accomplishment of these two officers was mentioned in the March judgment as an ode to the services rendered by the women officers in Army. Senor advocate V Mohana appearing for the two officers said that one officer was shown in low medical category at the relevant period due to her pregnancy while the other officer was being stopped for not producing medical documents of the relevant period.The bench told Centre, “It is not that she is unfit but that she was pregnant.” However, the Court reiterated, “By way of abundant caution, it is clarified, those officers who have disciplinary and vigilance clearance as of present will be eligible for grant of PC subject to other conditions mentioned in paragraph 120 of our judgment.” This paragraph required WSSCOs to be medically fit at the relevant assessment period.The women SSC officers had secured their right to permanent commission and command positions in non-combat streams at par with male officers after a prolonged legal battle culminating in the Supreme Court order on February 17, 2020. Later, the women officers again came to Court complaining against the whimsical standards on merit, medical fitness applied by Selection Board to deny them their due. This resulted in the March judgment. In June, Centre moved an application for clarification of the judgment stating that the 72 officers denied PC faced serious issues of discipline, disobedience of orders, lapses in government procurement, forging medical documents, poor work ethics, lack of professionalism, un-officer like conduct and poor performance in courses. The Court refused to entertain this application in August and directed Army to comply with the March judgment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-agrees-to-grant-pc-to-72-women-officers-spared-contempt-proceedings-by-top-court-101636726664772.html

12-11-2021||India||HT THIS DAY: November 13, 1969 —CWC expels PM Indira Gandhi from Congress, elect new leader, CPP told||New Delhi- The inevitable has happened. The simmering crisis in the Congress Party today (November 12) exploded into an open trial of strength between the two groups as the Congress Working Committee took the drastic and unprecedented step of expelling Prime Minister Indira Gandhi from the primary membership of the organization. After meeting for three hours, 11 of the 21 members of the Working Committee, including party President S. Nijalingappa, called for an immediate meeting of the Congress Parliamentary Party to elect a new leader. Mrs. Gandhi’s group of 10 boycotted the meeting. The expulsion of Mrs. Gandhi, who has been a member of the Congress for nearly three decades just two days before the birth anniversary of her father, Mr. Jawaharlal Nehru, followed rejection by Mr. Niialingappa’s group of the unity proposals evolved by Chief Ministers following a desperate bid to prevent a split in the party. The Prime Minister and her supporters refused to heed the Working Committee’s directive. After a meeting at her house they rejected the resolution as “illegal and invalid” and insisted that Mrs. Gandhi continued to be a member of the party as well as leader of the Congress Parliamentary Party so long as she continued to enjoy the support of the majority of its members.Within hours of the announcement of her expulsion which sent groups of student demonstrators shouting pro-Mrs. Gandhi slogans around the city, hundreds of baton-carrying policemen were posted outside the residences of Mr. Nijalingappa and his supporters in the Working Committee to provide them adequate security. PM backed Reacting with anger to the CWC’s decision - 167 Congress MPs, said to constitute the bulk of the party members now in the Capital, gathered at the rival AICC headquarters and pledged their support to Mrs Gandhi to save “democracy and socialism’ and called upon “democratic and progressive forces” to fight reaction. Two of them Mr M. V. Krishnappa and Mr Randhir Singh Chandhary, gave notice to the Congress Parliamentary Party office seeking the expulsion of Mr Morarji Desai, Mr S. K. Patil, Mr S. N. Mishrg and seven others from the party for contravening the constitution and acting against its declared policies.This will come up at the meeting of the Congress Parliamentary Party convened by Mrs Gandhi tomorrow for securing a vote of confidence. Acting on Congress President’s instructions, Mr S. N. Mishra, deputy leader of the Parliamentary Party from the Rajya Sabha, announced cancellation of the meeting scheduled for tomorrow. Mr Nijalingappa’s supporters among them Mr Kamaraj and Mr Morarji Desai, will boycott tomorrow’s meeting convened by the Prime Minister.The Working Committee itself acknowledged that it was the “saddest moment” in the history of the 84-year old organisation which had spear-headed the movement for independence and ruled at the Centre uninterruptedly since 1947. The charges Another resolution said that the CWC was “regretfully obliged to remove Mrs Gandhi from the party for her “patent and grave” acts of indiscipline.While the ACC general secretary, Mr Sadiq Ali, had claimed that the resolutions were passed unanimously, another source said that there had been no voting and that Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister C. B. Gupta had expressed himself against it. The Working Committee’s action has been criticized by a large number of Congressmen but supported by some.The charges listed by the Working Committee against Mrs Gandhi were (1) Opposing the party nominee for the Presidency.(2) Launching a signature campaign for ousting Congress President Nijalingappa and using pressure tactics to obtain signatures on the requisition. (3) Questioning the authority of the “legally constituted ‘ Working Committee and refusing to abide by its decisions(4) Constantly denigrating the organisation,(5) Sponsoring a rival Working Committee and a rival AlCC in violation of the party constitution.(6) Trying to divide Congressmen among those who, are her supporters and those who are not. (7) Her basic and overriding desire to concentrate all power in her hands, all of which “spell grave danger” to the democratic functioning of the Congress.As regards the Prime Mintster’s contention that there is greater need for harmony between the parliamentary wing .and the Congress organisation, the resolution said the word “harmony is a misnomer for dominance and the desire to capture the Congress machinery first at the top level and then at other levels.”Unhappy eventsBy another resolution, the Committee referred to the continuous chain of unhappy events since the Bangalore AICC causing anxiety and pain to millions of Congressmen. The Working Committee chose “between Mrs Gandhi and everything that the Congress stood for, and it has rightly decided in favour of the latter.It asked Congressmen not to falter and remain loyal to the organisation. This was clearly meant for the Prime Minister’s, supporters, who are organising , a rival AICC meeting. It ended with the declaration: “Le? Act the I future historians say of us that, I in the hour of peril both to the Congress and the nation we wavered and faltered in our loyalty to the great organisation to which we all have the honour to belong.” The first indication of the Working Committee’s decision came from Mr S. K. Patil, who while coming out of the meeting remarked: “It is not suspension. It is expulsion.” The AICC , General Secretary, Mr Sadia Ali, said both the resolutions were passed “unanimously.” Those who attended the meeting besides Mr Nijalingappa were Mr Sadia Alf. Mr P. Venkatasubbiah. Mr Morarji Desai, Mr S. K. Patil, Mr Atulya Ghosh, Mr K. Kamataj. Mr Hitendra Desai, Mr C. B. Gupta, Mr K. C. Abraham and Dr Ram Subagh Singh. The Chif Ministers had already abandoned their unity efforts after a meeting at U.P. Nivas which continued till the small hours of the morning. CM’s FormulaAccording to Mr Sukhadia, the proposal envisage: (1) The general AICC meeting agenda will include a review of the Faridabad Working Committee resolution on organisational elections and a decision by the AICC on the future course of action in this matter. (2) In view of the above, the requisitioned meeting of the AICC will be given up and no step shall be taken either at the organisational level or at the parliamentary level which is likely to adversely affect the unity of the party.(3) Charges against the Prime Minister contained in the letter of Oct. 28. Nov. 2 and Nov. 3 shall be withdrawn.(4) There shall be mutual discussion between the two sides to smoothen out difficulties and remove misunderstanding.Mr Sukhadia said this formula emerged as the most acceptable one even though three of the Chief minister- of Uttar Pradesh, Mysore and Gujarat-had some reservations regarding the third point in the proposal. The formula was put to the Congress President and his colleagues through Mr C. B. Gupta with an earnest appeal that this proposal be accepted by both the sides. “Unfortunately this has been turned down by the Congress President and his colleagues.” Mr Sukhadia added: “Our only satisfaction is that we tried our best to avoid a crisis.” He said the formula emerged after protracted meetings yesterday and fresh constitutions today to resolve the crisis in the party. He drew a parallel between the demand for withdrawal of the ‘ charge-sheet and the exoneration of Mr Nijalingappa of the charges I against him at the Aug. 28 Working Committee meeting which adopted the “unity” resolution. Although Mr C. B. Gupta appreciated the point, he could not persuade his colleagues in the Working Committee to accept it.Mr Nijalingappa, however, explained that the demand, for the withdrawal of the charge-sheet was not part of the Chief Ministers’ formula as originally brought to the Working Committee in the morning. The Committee had already approved of the formula as thought by Mr Hitendra Desai and Mr C. B. Gupta when a telephone call was received asking addition of the demand for withdrawal of the charge-sheet against, Mrs Gandhi and later also, of the Prime Minister’s letter to Mr Nijalingappa in reply. He declined to identify the caller. According to Mr Nijalingappa, instead of having unity on paper the need was for the two sides to have a heart o-heart talk and to remove the various prejudices. If the charge-sheet was withdrawn, there was nothing to discuss although the formula referred to mutual discussions between the two sides.He said the letter did not contain any charges against Mrs Gandhi. But they were only “complaints” listed chronologically about what had happened in the recent months. He parried a question whether the withdrawal of the charges and the counter-charges would not have been in keeping with his assertion of goodwill. He did not think that the CWC decision would affect the stability of the State Governments. “What about stability at the Centre?” Mr Nijalingappa replied: “We shall wait and see.”Mr Gupta and Mr Hitendra Desai came out of the Working Committee meeting and made a dash to U.P. Nivas where some Congress Chief Ministers were in session and apprised them of the Working Committee’s view. The unity efforts were thereupon abandoned. Mr Gupta and Mr Desai returned to the Working Committee meeting to inform the Nijalingappa group that the unity move was finally off. To demonstrate its support for the stand taken by Mr Nijalingappa, the Working Committee made some changes in the draft resolution and said it was “grateful” to the Congress President for his letter to the Prime Minister dated Oct. 28. The ‘ Committee endorsed “what has been said in that letter because it puts the case of the Working Committee in its proper sequence and perspective.“ The hard-liners were tho first to emerge from the meeting. Mr C. B. Gupta, who was involved in the unity efforts, was the last to leave. He looked visibly depressed and was helped out by an aide. Mr K. C. Abraham was standing behind the door as newsmen made a beeline for the AICC Secretary to snatch copies of the resolutions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htthisday-november-13-1969-cwc-expels-pm-indira-gandhi-from-congress-elect-new-leader-cpp-told-101636724984662.html

Norovirus is a highly contagious virus which usually spreads through stale food and water. The main symptoms for the disease are diarrohea, vomiting and stomach pain, medical experts said adding that it is a treatable disease. Veterinary college authorities said the infection was found in 13 students living outside the hostel and their samples had been sent to the NIV centre in Alappuzha which later confirmed the presence of the rare virus in the samples. State health minister Veena George who rushed to the district later chaired a meeting and asked health officials to take strict measures to contain it locally. “Everything is under control now. We have contained it locally. Some students started showing early symptoms ten days back and later more complained and we sent their samples to the NIV lab in Alappuzha,” said the minister adding that no fresh cases were reported after this. District health officials said a large-scale chlorination drive is underway and asked people to take fresh food and maintain proper hygiene. There is no cause for any concern but everyone should be cautious, they said asking people to wash their hands frequently to prevent the food-borne disease. Fruits and vegetables should be rinsed thoroughly and red meat and shellfish should be cooked and then consumed, they advised. The Norovirus infection was detected at a time when Kerala is struggling with mounting Covid-19 cases. For more than six months, the state topped the Covid-19 charts of the country. On Thursday Kerala had reported 7,224 cases and 47 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/13-students-of-veterinary-college-in-kerala-s-wayanad-test-positive-for-norovirus-101636720903868.html

Here’s what you need to know||Kerala health minister Veena George on Friday asked people to be vigilant and issued guidelines after norovirus, a highly contagious stomach bug that causes a range of symptoms, was confirmed in the state’s Wayanad district.Norovirus, an animal-borne disease transmitted through contaminated water and food, was reported in as many as 13 students of a veterinary college in Pookode near Vythiri in Wayanad district two weeks ago."Currently there is no cause for concern but everyone should be vigilant. Activities including super chlorination are underway. Drinking water sources need to be ensured to be hygienic," Veena George said."With proper prevention and treatment, the disease can be cured quickly. Therefore, everyone should be aware of the disease and its means of prevention," she added.What is norovirus?Norovirus causes gastrointestinal illness, including inflammation of the lining of the stomach and intestines, severe vomiting and diarrhoea.Norovirus does not significantly affect healthy people but it can be serious in young children, the elderly and people with comorbidities.Norovirus is easily transmitted through close contact with people who have been infected, or by touching contaminated surfaces. It can also be spread by eating food that has been prepared or handled by someone with the stomach bug. The virus is spread through the excrement and vomit of an infected person.What are the symptoms of norovirus?Diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, a high temperature, headache and body aches are some of the common symptoms of norovirus.Experts say acute vomiting and diarrhoea can lead to dehydration and further complications.What are the guidelines to prevent norovirus?The Kerala health ministry's guidelines say those infected with norovirus should rest at home, drink oral rehydration solutions (ORS) and boiled water.People should wash their hands thoroughly with soap and water before eating and after using the toilet. “Those who interact with animals should pay special attention," the health ministry's guidelines read.The guidelines said that drinking water sources, wells and storage tanks must be chlorinated with bleaching powder.

12-11-2021||India||2018 Kerala floods: CAG report points to flaws in state’s preparedness||A Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report has pointed out flaws, including failure in issuing mandatory alerts when the situation deteriorated, in Kerala’s flood preparedness and dam management during the 2018 deluge that left over 480 people dead. It added that most flaws were yet to be addressed. The findings of the government auditor have prompted demands from the opposition Congress for a probe.The report was tabled in the state assembly on Thursday and said there was a lack of real-time data on rainfall, water levels in important dams, and poor communication. “Communication infrastructure was non-functional in some areas including dam sites and government offices during or subsequent to the 2018 floods,” it said. It added the Kerala Water Policy 2008 was not updated in accordance with the National Water Policy.The report said 7,000-odd works for immediate repair and restoration of damages after the 2018 floods were approved under the State Disaster Response Fund. But it added only 18% of the work was completed even after three years. “The responsible authorities failed to issue mandatory alerts or warning when the rain situation deteriorated in 2018.”Also Read: Chennai deluge: Stories of hardship come flooding backThe report said no flood hazard map was available in the state. It added the flood susceptibility map also was not in conformation with the Central Water Commission criteria. “Siltation studies also found significant levels of siltation in many dams and works were very slow.”The report said that only six rain gauges were in place instead of 32 and highlighted unauthorised construction and mining in hilly terrains. It added no periodic capacity surveys or sedimentation studies were done for dams.The report comes as the state has faced flash floods and landslides for three years. In August 2019, 48 people died after a portion of a hill came down in Malappuram following heavy rains and flash floods. A year later, 74 people were killed in the Idukki district after a landslide followed by a flash flood in August 2020. In October, 42 people died after flash floods and landslides hit Kottayam and Idukki districts.The state government faced criticism over how water was released from dams simultaneously in 2018. E Sreedharan, who has since joined the Bharatiya Janata Party, was among those who moved the high court for a probe into the lapses.Congress sought the probe into the CAG findings saying the government, which is bound to protect lives and property, endangered the lives of people due to its inept handling. V D Satheesan, the leader of the Opposition, said it was a grave error on the part of the government and responsibility should be fixed.“The CAG has pointed out serious errors in flood management policies. The government even failed to constitute a probe after the deaths of many people. Even after the tragedy, the government’s track records show it is least bothered,” he said. He added the state’s floods plains have not been demarcated and flood zoning legislation was not done.M M Mani, who was the power minister in 2018, rejected most of the findings and suspected a political angle to the report. “In 2018, the state received the highest rainfall of the century. Some areas in Idukki received over 300 mm of rainfall in just two days. There is no mention of heavy rainfall in the report. It is easy to blame without understanding the ground situation,” he said. He added the government averted dam failures due to its effective handling. Dam expert James Wilson, who is a former member of the Mullaperiyar Dam Cell, cited changing rain patterns and threats of climate crisis while calling for the need to have experts’ teams for every day dam to monitor the situation. “We need a real-time decision. And we have to expedite dam and river-basin-related works and repairs on war footing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2018-kerala-floods-cag-report-points-to-flaws-in-state-s-preparedness-101636717063682.html

Acting on a tip-off by the locals, forest officials rushed to the spot and recovered the body.“Prima facie, it has been established that it was an accidental death. The tiger appears to have been run over by a speeding goods train. The forest officials of Nandyal range have taken the body to the veterinary hospital for post mortem,” Giddalur divisional forest officer G Sateesh said.A retired forest official of Kurnool district, who preferred anonymity, said the Nandyal-Guntur railway route passing through Nallamala forests has been very dangerous for wild animals.“This is not the first time that a tiger has been run over by a train. In April 2019, too, a tiger came under the wheels of a speeding train. Many other animals including monkeys, panthers and bears met with accidents in the last few years,” he said.Nandyal forest division comprises Gundla Bramheswaram wildlife sanctuary, which is home to tigers. The stretch between Gundla Bramheswaram and Vonitimitta in Kadapa district was identified as a tiger corridor witnessing frequent movement of tigers.“The only way to prevent such accidents on the route is to avoid operating trains during the night and reduce the speed of the trains,” the retired official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tiger-found-dead-on-railway-tracks-near-nallamala-forest-range-in-andhra-s-kurnool-101636716408215.html

The AQI was at 411 at 4 pm on Thursday. By 10 pm, it rose to 431with average PM10 and PM2.5 pollutant levels nearing the emergency threshold.“The capital of the country is not only in the grips speechwriters and advertisements but also in the grips of pollution. The capital of the country is suffocating- responsible for this is the BJP and the advertising campaigner AAP,” Congress said in a tweet. “BJP-AAP should quit making counter-accusations and allegations, and instead should find a solution.”AAP leader and Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai asked the Congress to stop meddling and focus on Punjab that the latter rules and where stubble burning contributes to the pollution in the region. “This (stubble burning) is causing heightened amounts of pollution in Delhi.” He added the Delhi government was taking measures to control pollution through multiple campaigns.BJP spokesman Tom Vadakkan blamed AAP for the pollution. “Pollution is an ongoing issue in Delhi. The problem is that they (AAP) are not a proactive government; they are a pro-publicity government,” Vadakkan said. “AAP only does publicity stunts like giving free water and electricity… They can blame Haryana and Punjab for the pollution, but the truth is that they do not want to take responsibility for their city.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-hits-out-at-bjp-aap-for-incompetence-in-managing-pollution-in-ncr-101636715623829.html

Haugen testified after leaking internal research documents to authorities and The Wall Street Journal. The documents reference to research and findings of Facebook’s researchers. Among those, some related to India, referencing what they said were fear-mongering and dehumanising content promoted by Facebook accounts purportedly believed to be either run by or associated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the ideological fountainhead of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.Gogoi referred to “the recent revelations made by former employees of Facebook” regarding internal policies and action taken relating to the moderation of content. “Considering the pivotal role Facebook plays today in disseminating information and shaping public opinion, such allegations if true are likely to have an adverse public impact,” said the letter, a copy of which HT has seen.Another former Facebook employee Sophie Zhang earlier highlighted the company’s partisan policy in removing inauthentic accounts ahead of the 2020 Delhi elections. She has also expressed willingness to testify before the Indian Parliament.Gogoi, who is also a member of the joint parliamentary committee set up in 2019 to look into the Personal Data Protection Bill that is expected to have implications for social media companies, said Facebook needs to make a “conscious effort to protect its users”.“It is particularly noteworthy that Ms Haugen worked on the company’s election interference team and expressed her displeasure towards the company’s lack of openness regarding the potential harm it was causing in that sphere, in addition to others. This exposes that in events where there is a conflict of interest between the of young individuals along with the failure of the company to address these flaws good of the people and the profitable/favourable outcomes for the company, Facebook has been choosing the latter.” He added they are cognizant that Facebook’s business model does involve the collection of data of its users and its subsequent processing. He asked what action will the company take to rectify the “mistakes”. “Despite Facebook situating itself as a pioneer for transparency and reiterating its mission to tackle misinformation and hate, it is disappointing to witness the company suppress information and key aspects of internal research from the public and its users based on convenience.”There was no immediate response from Mohan or Facebook.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-mp-writes-to-facebook-india-head-over-company-s-partisan-policies-101636710524484.html

India is on the march and you will see that you will be leading these police forces at a time when it will bring India which has got a new place in the international arena," Doval told young Indian Police Service (IPS) officers in Hyderabad.The NSA was speaking at the passing out parade of the 73rd batch of IPS probationers at the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy (SVPNPA).The quintessence of democracy does not lie in the ballot box but it lies in the laws which are made by the people who are elected by or are elected through those ballot boxes, Doval said.“You are the ones who are the enforcers of those laws. Laws are not as good as they are made. Laws are as good as they are executed and implemented and service the people are going to get out of them,” he said.“The implementation of those laws are important. No nation can be built where rule of law has failed. People cannot feel safe and secure where law enforcers are weak, corrupt, partisan," he maintained.Police have to work closely with other organisations for which they require a mental attitude together to serve the nation, he said.Wars have ceased to become an effective instrument giving their political and military objective even as they are unaffordable, uncertain about their outcome, he said, adding it is the civil society that can be subverted, divided and manipulated "to hurt the interest of the nation," Doval said."If internal security fails, no country can be great. If people are not secure, people are not safe, they cannot rise to the potential and probably the country will never grow," he further said.He also said that police forces have a greater role in border management besides maintaining law and order. He said maintaining law and order in every part of the 32 lakh sq km of India is also the responsibility of police forces. Doval said, “India's sovereignty goes as far as the last police station's jurisdiction from the coastal areas to the border areas.”"…Not only the policing about which you have been trained very well. But it will extend. You will be responsible for the border management of this country. Fifteen-thousand km of the border, most of it has got these peculiar problems of its own," he added."There is a border in Pakistan with China or Myanmar or Bangladesh. We have got different types of security-related issues which are manned by the police and the central police organisations which are manning these borders," Doval said.The Hyderabad-based Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy trains officers of the Indian Police Service, selected through the Civil Services Examination conducted by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-is-on-a-march-will-be-one-of-the-leading-nations-when-it-turns-100-doval-101636704913953.html
12-11-2021||India||Ashram 3 controversy: Bajrang Dal leader got bail within 24 hours after arrest||Bajrang Dal leader Sushil Sudele, a murder convict out on bail since 2015, and six others got bail within 24 hours after their arrest for allegedly vandalising the sets of web series Ashram 3 on October 24.Sudele and six others created ruckus on the sets and smeared ink on filmmaker Prakash Jha. They also roughed up crew members while seeking the change of the name of the series. The mob chased the crew. Jha did not file any complaint. But Bhopal Police registered a case on its own and booked seven including Sudele, Jeevan Sharma, Abhijeet, Dilip, Karan, Shrawan Batham, and Sunil Soni under section 147 (rioting), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 336 (act endangering life or personal safety of others) and 427 (mischief causing damage) of the Indian Penal Code. All the sections are bailable.Deputy inspector general Irshad Wali said, “Sudele and six accused got bail on October 26... as per Supreme Court order under which the bail should be given to the accused booked under offences for which prescribed punishment is seven years or less.”Also Read: ‘Stop comedian’s show or we will’: VHP’s ultimatum to Chhattisgarh govtA Bhopal court in 2014 sentenced Sudele to 14-year imprisonment for conspiracy in the murder of travel agency owner Bhagchand. According to the charge sheet, Sudele extorted money and Bhagchand exposed him in 2011. On February 5, 2011, Sudele, another Bajrang Dal leader Rajkumar Chaurasiya and four others attacked Bhagchand with canes and rods. Bhagchand succumbed to his injuries four days later. In September 2015, Sudele and Rajkumar were released on bail.The opposition Congress accused the state government of patronising the goons and criminals. “Why police did not seek cancellation of his bail. Police registered the case under the weaker section. These Bajrang Dal goons have the clear support of home minister Narottam Mishra and police,” said Congress leader JP Dhanopia. “This incident cleared all the doubts.”Mishra supported the attack and said the filmmaker should change the name of the series. He said the government will introduce a law for filmmakers mandating prior permission for scripts on controversial topics.Despite repeated attempts, Mishra could not be contacted for his comments.BJP leader Rajneesh Agrawal said, “It is a matter of law. The efforts of police should be appreciated for taking suo moto action but Congress leaders have now made this a habit to target government and police without any reason.”Sudele said after he got bail in 2015, he was never booked for any other case. “Even on October 24, it was Bajrang Dal activists who lost control after some bouncers misbehaved with them. I was not present at the time when an activist threw ink and vandalised the sets. I went there to give a statement to the media. I did not have any direct connection to this case so there is no reason for cancelling my bail.”Bajrang Dal is the youth wing of Vishwa Hindu Parishad, an affiliate of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the ruling Bharatiya Janata party’s ideological fountainhead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ashram-3-controversy-bajrang-dal-leader-got-bail-within-24-hours-after-arrest-101636704103060.html

The book by the former Union minister on the Ayodhya verdict was released on Wednesday.The BJP has also attacked the author over the same and said that Khurshid has "not only hurt Hindus but also the soul of India." BJP leader Gaurav Bhatia on Thursday also addressed a conference to launch a scathing attack on the Congress veteran.Condemning the purported remarks in the book, Bhatia claimed that the Congress party's "ideology and principle is to spread hatred against the Hindu community and to ill-treat the Hindus." He also alleged that the Congress party is "weaving a web against Hindus."Bhatia further questioned Congress president Sonia Gandhi and party leader Rahul Gandhi over their silence on the issue. "If you remain silent, then it will be clear that your ideology is also against the Hindus," he said.The BJP is now demanding the removal of Khurshid from the Congress party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/salman-khurshid-row-madhya-pradesh-minister-vows-to-get-book-banned-101636703242927.html
12-11-2021||India||'Those who chant Jai Shri Ram are not all saints': Congress leader Rashid Alvi's statement sparks row||Amid controversy over Salman Khurshid's observation on Hindutva in his new book on Ayodhya verdict, a video of Congress leader Rashid Alvi purportedly saying that 'not all people who chant Jai Shri Ram are saints' has gone viral. BJP's Amit Malviya shared the video of the senior Congress leader addressing a gathering and tweeted, "After Salman Khurshid, now Congress leader Rashid Alvi is saying those who chant Jai Shri Ram are demons. How much poison does Congress have towards the devotees of Ram!" सलमान ख़ुर्शीद के बाद अब कांग्रेस के नेता राशिद अल्वी जय श्री राम कहने वालों को निशाचर (राक्षस) बता रहे हैं।राम भक्तों के प्रति कांग्रेस के विचारों में कितना ज़हर घुला हुआ है। pic.twitter.com/kHG3vXSpDWRashid Alvi said when Hanuman went to bring sanjeevani booti for Laxman, a demon in the form of a saint chanted Jai Shri Ram to divert him. It is in this context that the Congress leader warned that not all who chant 'Jai Shri Ram' are saints, some are demons."Laxman's situation was deteriorating.. and it was believed that sanjeevani booti was effective only before the sunrise. Otherwise, it was difficult to save the life. Hanumanji was entrusted with the responsibility of bringing sanjeevani booti from the Himalayas. Ravan sent a demon in the form of a saint to waste Hanumanji's time so that he could not not bring sanjeevani before sunrise..."The rakshas was chanting Jai Shri Ram.. Nowadays, many people chant this. Hanumanji descended because he was a devotee. The demon wanted to waste his time and asked Hanumanji to take a dip in Manasarovar as without taking a bath, no one should chant Jai Shri Ram. Today however people chant Jai Shri Ram without taking bath. A crocodile who was an apsara and turned into a crocodile by some curse then caught Hanumanji's feet. Taking the form of the apsara, she told Hanuman that the 'saint' chanting Jai Shri Ram is actually a rakshas," the Congress leader said."What I want to tell you as I conclude my speech is that today also there are many people chanting Jai Shri Ram. They are not all saints, they are demons. Be wary of them," the Congress leader said.The comment comes at a time when veteran Congress leader Salman Khurshid has compared Hindutva with ISIS and Boko Haram in his new book on Supreme Court's Ayodhya verdict. "Sanatan Dharma and classical Hinduism known to sages and saints were being pushed aside by a robust version of Hindutva, by all standards a political version similar to the jihadist Islam of groups like ISIS and Boko Haram of recent years," the controversial passage reads.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/those-who-chant-jai-shri-ram-are-not-all-saints-congress-leader-rashid-alvi-s-statement-sparks-row-101636701856471.html

12-11-2021||India||'Looks like Kangana Ranaut took heavy dose of...': Nawab Malik on ‘freedom in 2014' row||Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik on Friday condemned Kangana Ranaut's statement that India got real freedom in 2014 and said it seems the Bollywood actor is on a heavy dose of Malana cream, news agency ANI reported. "We strongly condemn actress Kangana Ranaut's statement that India got freedom in 2014. She insulted freedom fighters. The Centre must take back the Padma Shri from Kangana and arrest her," the minister said. "Looks like Kangana Ranaut took a heavy dose of Malana Cream (a particular variety of hashish which grows specifically in HP) before making such a statement," Maharastra Minister Nawab Malik added while reacting to actress' statement that 'India got freedom in 2014'Talking about India's freedom movement, Kangana has recently said that India got its actual freedom in 2014, apparently referring to Narendra Modi becoming the prime minister. Answering a question on Veer Savarkar, Kangana said the Congress is an extension of the British. The actor said the country got 'bheek' in 1947 and the real freedom came in 2014.As the comment stirred a major controversy with politicians, Bollywood celebrities slamming Kangana, the actor defended her statement and said, "Even though I clearly mentioned that 1857 freedom fight was the first revolution that was curbed… which led to more atrocities and cruelties from the British and almost a century was given to us in Gandhi's begging bowl… Jaa aur ro ab (Go cry some more)."Cutting across political parties, Kangana's comment has drawn flak. While the Congress demanded a recall of Kangana's Padma Shri, BJP MP Varun Gandhi exclaimed whether it is madness or treason. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said being a son of a freedom fighter, he found Kangana's comment as the biggest misuse of freedom (of speech).The Aam Aadmi Party has already submitted a complaint to the Mumbai Police asking it to register a case against the Bollywood actor for his seditious remark.The arrest of Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan Khan in a drugs case has become a political controversy with the NCP criticising the role of central agency NCB and the BJP defending the central agency. Earlier, Kangana Ranaut comment on the issue of Aryan Khan as she said, "Now all Mafia Pappu coming to Aaryan Khan’s defence…. We make mistakes but we mustn’t glorify them … I trust this will give him perspective and also make him realise consequences of his actions…. Hopefully, it can evolve him and make him better and bigger. It’s good not to gossip about someone when they vulnerable but it’s criminal to make them feel that they did no wrong."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/looks-like-kangana-ranaut-took-heavy-dose-of-nawab-malik-on-freedom-in-2014-row-101636697531171.html

The two schemes--RBI Retail Direct Scheme and RBI-Integrated Ombudsman Scheme--will further expand the scope of investment for investors in the country, he said.Listing more benefits of the two plans, PM Modi said that these will make access to capital markets easier and more secure for investors. “With the RBI Retail Direct Scheme, small investors now have a medium through which they can safely invest in government securities. The Integrated Ombudsman Scheme has led to the ‘One Nation, One Ombudsman system’ taking shape in the country,” Prime Minister Modi said.Talking about various reforms undertaken by his government since 2014, when he first became Prime Minister, PM Modi said that during this period, emphasis was given to recovery and resolution. He added, “In the last seven years, non-performing assets were recognised with transparency and public sector banks were recapitalised. To further strengthen this sector, co-operative banks were brought under the purview of the RBI.”He then stressed that the needs of the country, and those of the citizens, should always be kept at the forefront. “We should continuously strengthen the faith of the investors. I am fully confident that the RBI will continue to strengthen India's new identity as a sensitive and investor-friendly destination,” PM Modi remarked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/these-will-expand-scope-of-investment-pm-modi-launches-rbi-s-customer-centric-initiatives-101636696381777.html

And those with high fatigue are likely to have higher inflammatory markers during the course of the infection as well as increased blood sugar levels afterwards. They also experience lower handgrip strength, according to a study by researchers from Fortis C-Doc in collaboration with the All India Institute of Medical Sciences and Diabetes Foundation.Fatigue is the most common symptom that patients who have recovered from Covid-19 experience.“Fatigue is a predominant and very debilitating factor, present afterwards in both hospitalized and non-hospitalised Covid patients. Fatigue and associated symptoms decrease quality of life and interfere with normal working capacity. The study shows diabetes complicates the course of Covid-19 and influences long Covid-19,” said Dr Anoop Misra, director of diabetes and endocrinology, Fortis C-DOC.Also Read: Lancet publication marks safety and efficacy of Covaxin, says Bharat Biotech“In addition, diabetes poses challenges in the recovery of patients. It is imperative, therefore, for chronic diabetic patients to follow a healthy lifestyle, adhere to treatment guidelines and go for regular health checks.”Those with high fatigue score of more than four are likely to experience the symptoms and hence their recovery and rehabilitation will need careful attention to nutrition, glycaemic control, and a graduated physical activity protocol, according to the study recently published in the journal Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome: Clinical Research & Reviews.The study compared the level of fatigue among 52 persons with type 2 or adult-onset diabetes, who had a history of Covid-19, and 56 persons with type 2 diabetes but no history of Covid-19.“This new important study re-emphasizes that management of diabetes should be sustained and more stringent during a pandemic. Blood glucose and blood pressure should be optimal and more aggressive glycemic management is required. Special care must be taken regarding nutrition and protein and vitamin supplements should be used as required. Exercise and physiotherapy should be started early after Covid-19 as it may benefit not only fatigue but cardiovascular and pulmonary health and mental well-being of the patient,” said Dr Misra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fatigue-complications-more-likely-in-diabetics-who-get-covid-19-study-101636696362815.html

A similar weather forecast was also issued for coastal Andhra Pradesh, Rayalaseema, south interior Karnataka and Kerala."The depression over north coastal Tamil Nadu weakened into a well-marked low-pressure area and the associated cyclonic circulation extends up to 5.8 km above mean sea level," the IMD said in its weather forecast bulletin."Under its influence, light to moderate rainfall at most places with heavy rainfall at isolated places very likely over Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, coastal Andhra Pradesh, Rayalaseema, south interior Karnataka and Kerala during the next 24 hours," it also said.The warning comes a day after parts of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry witnessed torrential rains leading to extreme waterlogging conditions.In Coimbatore, schools were closed on Wednesday in wake of the red alert issued by the weather department. Authorities suspended arrivals at the Chennai airport due to the heavy rains.However, the situation moved towards normalcy on Friday as shops started reopening and traffic movement resumed in Chennai after Thursday's torrential rains, according to visuals posted by news agency ANI.Meanwhile, 18 self-contained teams of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) have been deployed in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Puducherry to tackle the issues related to rescuing and relief arising out of the situation. Of these 18 teams, 11 are deployed in Tamil Nadu, two in Puducherry and five in Andhra Pradesh.The deployed teams are now working to move people to safety and are also providing help to those affected in coordination with local authorities.

12-11-2021||India||Don't want to rush, says health minister on Covid-19 vaccine for children||Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Thursday said the government does not want to make haste about administering the Covid-19 vaccine to children and any decision in this regard will be taken based on expert opinion.On when vaccination for children could start as Zydus Cadila's Covid-19 vaccine has been granted emergency use authorisation for those 12-year-old and above, he said children were not being inoculated against Covid-19 on a large scale anywhere in the world though it has been initiated in some countries in a limited manner."We do not want to rush this thing. Since this is a matter related to children, the expert group is carrying out further studies," he said at the ‘Times Now Summit 2021’.All the vaccines which have currently received emergency use authorisation will be granted full authorisation only after a detailed study and based on the data of four to five years, he said."It is through data and experience we have learned that even after vaccination Covid can happen. Then again, data emerged stating that after vaccination one does not get severe Covid. The first dose gives 96 per cent protection and both doses give 98.5 per cent protection."About vaccinating the children, we will make a decision based on expert opinion. We have decided to think and evaluate before going ahead with vaccinating children as they are the future of our country and we need to tread with caution in this matter," the minister said.On the probability of administering a booster dose, he said adequate stocks are available and the aim is to complete the vaccination of the target population with two doses. After that, a decision on booster dose would be taken based on expert recommendation, Mandaviya said."The government cannot take a direct decision in such a matter. When the Indian Council of Medical Research and expert team will say that a booster dose should be given, we will consider it then," he said, adding Prime Minister Narendra Modi has always depended on expert opinion, be it vaccine research, manufacturing, or approval.Despite a large population and diverse challenges, nearly 80 per cent of India's adult population have taken at least the first dose. The country's vaccination performance has been remarkable, Mandaviya said.About Covaxin's approval by WHO, the minister said that he had discussed the matter with WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on more than a couple of occasions to understand the requirements a vaccine needed to fulfill to get the clearance."It is a matter of great pride that a vaccine developed and manufactured in India has been given EUA status."Asked if the delay in getting the EUA was because Covaxin is an Indian vaccine  and if there was there any discrimination against India, the Mandaviya replied, "I will not get into this matter."He informed that 97 countries have recognised Covishield and Covaxin.In the coming days, vaccines manufactured in India will be made available around the globe at affordable rates, Mandaviya said and stressed India will play a major role in global Covid vaccination efforts."We will get 31 crore doses in November with more due in December. Another five to six companies are set to come to India to manufacture vaccines here. We will help meet the world's requirement for Covid vaccines by providing USD 18 to 20 vaccines at USD 3 to 4. This is our commitment," he said.The minister said that 16 crore vaccine doses are lying with the states and Union Territories.Referring to the 'Har Ghar Dastak' vaccination at doorstep campaign, he said, "By December 31 we want to complete our target of vaccinating people aged 18 and above. It now depends on people's support."Asked about the possibility of a third wave, Mandaviya said, "Covid is not over. Cases are rising globally. In Russia, China, Hong Kong cases are rising again despite more than 80 per cent vaccination. Vaccination and Covid-appropriate behaviour have to go hand in hand."On preparations for a probable third wave, he said Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission has been launched and ₹65,000 crore will be spent in the next five years to ramp up the health infrastructure across the country.The aim is to form such a level of preparedness that India is ready to fight a pandemic-like exigency if anything like it comes up in the next 50 years, the Union health minister said."The second wave pointed out the shortages in health infrastructure. But, we don't believe in a blame game. PM Modi has linked health with development and the government under his leadership always made efforts to expand and strengthen health facilities," he said.Discussing the Health Infrastructure Mission, Mandaviya said modern laboratories will be set up at the district level which will conduct 115 types of medical tests for the poor citizens free of cost.Critical care units will be set up at the district level equipped with a 100-bed facility that has oxygen and ventilators. Besides, a research centre at the regional level will be set up so that epidemics are recognised on time before they assume pandemic proportions, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-want-to-rush-says-health-minister-on-covid-19-vaccine-for-children-101636694380748.html

The communication of all channels in the tunnel is independent, simultaneous and failure-free. Completion of this work will ensure safe and smooth running of trains inside the tunnels, on undoubtedly, one of the most difficult terrains of Indian Railways," it added.Puneet Chawla, RailTel’s CMD, said RailTel has the expertise to execute it for improving train operations as well as safety."We are already executing similar projects for Panvel-Karjat, Karjat-Lonawala and Kasara-Igatpuri section of Mumbai Division of Central Railway, and Castle Rock-Kulem section (Braganza Ghat) of South Western Railway,” Chawla said.“We are eyeing more similar projects, and generating good revenue from these niche projects will not only help to diversify the work experience of RailTel but will also enable us to contribute towards nation-building," he added.The tunnel communication system project will achieve continuous coverage over the entire length of the tunnel and clear audio throughout with no interference. It will also have reliable system operation under harsh tunnel environmental conditions, trunked radio channels across many bands and ease of system operation and maintenance.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/railtel-to-implement-tunnel-communication-system-in-kashmir-valley-101636694839531.html

12-11-2021||India||Goa minister says his wife will ‘most certainly’ contest state polls from Siolim||Goa minister Michael Lobo has unilaterally announced that his wife, Delilah Lobo, would “most certainly” contest the assembly polls from Siolim amid growing discord within the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ahead of the polls due in the state next year. He has also backed Congress leader Sudhir Kandolkar saying the latter would win irrespective of the ticket he contests on. Lobo did not specify whether he will seek BJP tickets for his wife or Kandolkar but said he would only be backing them.Lobo’s announcement came even as state BJP president Sadanand Shet Tanavade has repeatedly asked ticket aspirants to respect the party’s internal processes. “I have spoken on this issue. There is nothing new to add. I do not wish to comment further.”Tanavade earlier said the ticket distribution process involves a recommendation from the state unit to the national parliamentary board, which takes a final decision. “Until that process is completed, no person can decide for himself that he is contesting on a BJP ticket,” Tanavade said earlier.Also Read: Goa BJP chief hits out at Arvind Kejriwal over temple runFormer BJP lawmaker Dayanand Mandrekar, who lost from Siolim in 2017, is believed to be keen on getting the BJP ticket for the seat for himself or his son.Former chief minister and BJP leader Laxmikant Parsekar, who is hoping to contest from Mandrem constituency, faces a challenge from Dayanand Sopte, who currently represents the seat. Sopte “officially” launched his campaign with BJP flags for his re-election. He contested against Parsekar in 2017 on a Congress ticket. He later resigned, joined the BJP, and was re-elected.Lobo has insisted his wife and Kandolkar will win. “I think that this time 100% the people will get them elected. Delilah will contest from Siolim with the blessings of the people,” Lobo said on Wednesday. On Thursday, Lobo said certain lawmakers have not performed without naming anyone. “People of Goa want good candidates so that their issues are addressed and solved whether it is water or electricity. Today people are fighting for basic necessities. These are good candidates. People across Goa are looking for good candidates.”He added the lawmakers are unavailable to the people. “I am not asking for tickets for anybody. I am saying good candidates should be given tickets; these are our names. Let us see which party later,” Lobo said.Lobo said his wife herself decided to contest from Siolim and that the initial feedback was positive. He added this is what prompted him to decide he would back her irrespective of what the BJP may have to say.Kandolkar, whom Lobo is backing in Mapusa, is a former BJP member. He was close to former deputy chief minister Francis D’Souza, who passed away in 2019. In the by-election necessitated by D’Souza’s death, the BJP fielded his son, Joshua, and prompted Kandolkar to join the Congress and contest from Mapusa. Joshua won with a smaller margin.Kandolkar said he expected a Congress ticket and welcomed Lobo’s support.Congress’s Agnelo Fernandes, who has earlier represented Lobo’s Calangute constituency, said he would “fight the forces out to destroy Goa”. He accused Lobo of being in cahoots with the “builder and casino lobby”.The BJP, which seeks to retain power in the state, has 27 lawmakers in the 39-member House while the Congress has four, Goa Forward three, the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party and Nationalist Congress Party one each. There are three independents in the House.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-minister-says-his-wife-will-most-certainly-contest-state-polls-from-siolim-101636692762446.html

India has neither accepted such illegal occupation of our territory nor has it accepted the unjustified Chinese claims," ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said.Bipin Rawat, on the other hand, said the reports that the Chinese have come into Indian territory is not true. "The present controversy - that has erupted - that the Chinese have come across into our territory and built a new village is not true. But what I wish to come out with is that Chinese are building villages possibly for billeting and locating their civilians or for their military in the future all along the LAC, particularly after the recent face-offs that we have had," Bipin Rawat said."EAM says we will not accept China's illegal occupation! CDS gives 'clean chit' to China? Earlier, PM told an all-party meeting 'no one has entered our territory'. Defence ministry has conducted 13 rounds of talks with China on Depsang-Gogra. Will Modi govt state the truth?" Surjewala tweeted.The statement of the ministry was India's first official response to the Pentagon report that China has built a village in Arunachal Pradesh. "The government is committed to the objective of creating infrastructure along border areas for improvement of livelihood, including in Arunachal Pradesh. The government keeps a constant watch on developments having bearing on India's security and takes all measures to safeguard the sovereignty and territorial integrity," Bagchi said. Rawat's comment was part of Times Now Summit 2021. "Wherever the Chinese have now developed their posts, we have seen some old dilapidated huts that existed in that area," he said."Yes, maybe a couple of them, the villages, have increased in size. What I would probably feel is that these are to billet the Chinese soldiers and subsequently, they may also be planning to facilitate the arrival of their families once in a while... Our civilians going there, our families visiting forward areas, so they are watching all this," Rawat said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-modi-govt-tell-truth-asks-congress-after-bipin-rawat-mea-differ-on-china-101636692288003.html

There has been a 1.18% increase in income from unknown sources.“At present, political parties are not required to reveal the name of individuals or organizations giving less than Rs. 20,000. As a result, a substantial amount of funds cannot be traced and are from ‘unknown’ sources,” the NGO said in the fresh report.ADR found Telangana chief minister K Chandrashekhar Rao’s Telangana Rashtra Samithi declared ₹89.158 crores income from unknown sources, the highest among regional parties in 2019-20. Similarly, Telugu Desam Party, Yuvajana Sramika Rythu Congress Party, Biju Janata Dal, and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam declared ₹81.694 crores, ₹74.75 crores, ₹50.58 crores, and Rs. 45.50 crores.The report said income contribution reports of the Aam Aadmi Party, Indian Union Muslim League, and Lok Jansakhti Party are available but their donations data show discrepancies. ADR found that the total declared contributions of the three parties are less than the total donation declared in their reports by ₹6.105 crores, ₹31.20 lakhs, and ₹4.16 lakhs. “This is an example of disregard of the parties towards the guidelines formulated for transparency and disclosure requirements.”ADR earlier this year said that national parties collected ₹3,377.41 crore or 70.98% of the total from unknown sources in the 2019-20 financial year. It found Bharatiya Janata Party declared ₹2,642.63 crore as income from unknown sources, the highest among the national parties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/25-regional-parties-collected-55-50-of-total-income-from-unknown-sources-in-2019-20-adr-101636689283376.html
12-11-2021||India||77.8% efficacy, robust antibody response: 5 points from Lancet's new study on Covaxin||The Lancet peer-review has now corroborated Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech's efficacy analysis regarding Covaxin, its coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccine, and confirmed that the shot demonstrates 77.8 per cent efficacy against patients symptomatic with the infectious disease.1 . In its new study, The Lancet noted that the Covid-19 vaccine made by Bharat Biotech is ‘highly efficacious’ and presents no safety concern, also inducing a “robust antibody response” two weeks after two doses of the shot are administered.2. The Lancet journal, although it corroborated Bharat Biotech's efficacy analysis for Covaxin, also noted that more research is needed to understand more about Covaxin's long-term safety and effectiveness, as well as protection against hospitalisation.3. Further research is also needed to effectively study Covaxin's effect on deterring Covid-19 deaths, and also its ability to fend off the Delta variant and other variants of concern of the coronavirus.4. Only 684 suspected Covid-19 cases were identified at least 14 days after the second dose, among the total 24,419 participants who received both doses of the vaccine.5. Of the confirmed cases, nine did not meet the case definition, being either seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline or only having one symptom, and thus 130 cases were included in the efficacy analysis. 24 (0.3 per cent) cases occurred among 8471 participants in the vaccine group and 106 (1.2 per cent) among 8502 participants in the placebo group, resulting in an estimated vaccine efficacy of 77.8 per cent.Notably, Covaxin was recently granted the much-coveted emergency use authorisation (EUA) by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the shot has already been cleared for use in as many as 17 nations. With the recent green signal from the global health body, Covaxin has now joined a shortlist of anti-Covid vaccines approved by WHO – which include the shots manufactured by AstraZeneca/Oxford, Johnson&Johnson, Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech, Sinopharm, and Sinovac.While approving Covaxin, WHO noted that this vaccine is “extremely suitable for low- and middle-income countries due to easy storage requirements”.Bharat Biotech had informed back in July that the safety and efficacy analysis data from the Phase-III clinical trials of Covaxin had shown an efficacy rate of 77.8 per cent against mild, moderate, and severe instances of Covid-19. Against severe symptomatic cases of Covid-19, on the other hand, Covaxin was found to be 93.4 per cent effective, the Hyderabad-based pharmaceutical firm had said.The Phase III trials for Covaxin were conducted on 25,798 subjects – aged between 18 to 98 years – across 25 sites in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/778-efficacy-robust-antibody-response-5-points-from-lancet-s-new-study-on-covaxin-101636684611566.html

After Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad said he disagrees with what Khurshid has written in his new book on Ayodhya and that comparing Hindutva with ISIS and Boko Haram is an exaggeration, Khurshid said it varies from person to person. "It may seem exaggerated to him, it does not seem exaggerated to me," Khurshid said.Ghulam Nabi Azad issued a statement and said he does not agree with Khurshid's take on Hindutva and thinks that comparing Hindutva with ISIS and Jihadist Islam is factually wrong and an exaggeration."I don't want to engage him (Azad) in an argument because I think he must have said it in a casual moment when he had nothing serious thoughtful consideration of it. But if he said it, we respect him for what he says, he is a senior person, but it will not make me change my mind," Khurshid said.Defending his viewpoint, Khurshid explained that his point of comparison was on distorting religion. "I have not called these guys terrorists. I have just said they are similar in distorting religion. What Hindutva has done, it has pushed aside Sanatan Dharma' and Hinduism and it has taken over a robust, aggressive position similar to Boko Haram and those other guys," Khurshid told PTI."I could not find anybody else that they could be similar to. I said they are similar to them, that's all, nothing to do with Hinduism. Hindutva, as portrayed by its proponents, is distorting religion," he said.In a chapter titled 'The Saffron Sky' in the newly launched book, Khurshid wrote, "Sanatan Dharma and classical Hinduism known to sages and saints were being pushed aside by a robust version of Hindutva, by all standards a political version similar to the jihadist Islam of groups like ISIS and Boko Haram of recent years."Two advocates have filed complaints against Khurshid's comments while BJP leaders have sought action against Khurshid. Union minister Prahlad Joshi said the Congress should take action against Khurshid. Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi should visit a temple to reveal their ‘gotra’ (clan) and assert that they are Hindus, the minister said.BJP's Amit Malviya said since Ghulam Nabi Azad is a G-23 leader (group of 23 rebel Congress leaders) and Salman Khurshid in close to the Gandhis, it would be "fair to assume" that Khurshid is echoing the Gandhis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/exaggerated-to-him-not-me-salman-khurshid-on-ghulam-nabi-s-take-on-hindutva-101636685699137.html
12-11-2021||India||‘Not true’: CDS refutes reports of China building villages on Indian territory||Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) Bipin Rawat on Thursday refuted all rumours regarding China building its villages on Indian territory and said that there are no transgressions against the Indian “perception” of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) as of yet. Referring to the controversy over Chinese troops crossing into the Indian side for the purpose of constructing a new village, CDS Rawat said that these reports were “not true” and that although the said villages exist, they are well within the Chinese side of the LAC.The Defence chief's remarks assume special importance since they come in the wake of a recent report issued by the US department of defence, in which it said that China had built a large village inside the “disputed territory” between Tibet Autonomous Region and Arunachal Pradesh in the eastern sector of the LAC.Reacting officially to the US report, India's ministry of external affairs had earlier said that it neither accepts China's “illegal occupation of its territory nor any unjustified Chinese claims.”Speaking at a media conclave on Thursday, CDS Rawat outright refuted the reports and said, “as far as we are concerned, no such village development has taken place on our side of the LAC.”“The present controversy that has erupted, that the Chinese have come across into our territory and built a new village is not true,” he added.The Defence chief, however, shed some light on the possible purpose with which the Chinese are building villages close to the LAC. “But what I wish to come out with is that Chinese are building villages possibly for billeting and locating their civilians or for their military in the future all along the LAC,” the CDS added, “…particularly after the recent face-offs that we have had.” Rawat also said both the Indian and Chinese forces have posted troops on their respective side of the LAC. “Wherever the Chinese have now developed their posts, we have seen some old dilapidated huts that existed in that area,” he said. “So, some of those huts have been broken and newer infrastructure was being built up and modern huts are coming up.”“Yes, maybe a couple of them, the villages, have increased in size. What I would probably feel is that these are to billet the Chinese soldiers and subsequently, they may also be planning to facilitate the arrival of their families once in a while... Our civilians going there, our families visiting forward areas, so they are watching all this,” he explained.Noting that Chinese soldiers are isolated, Rawat said, “He (a Chinese soldier) is living thousands of miles away from the mainland. And he sees our people that they are in a much happier state. They get to go home much faster.”The Indian soldiers do get leave to go home from the positions on LAC at least twice a year if not thrice, he said, adding that the Chinese soldiers do not have this luxury.“They are building this infrastructure, this kind of so-called villages, which are well within their side of the LAC. They have not transgressed anywhere on our perception of the LAC,” he said.He said there are different perceptions of the LAC but the Indian armed forces know where the LAC lies because they have been told that this is your alignment of the LAC and this is the territory you are expected to defend.“The Chinese have a perception and in some areas, we know about it, and in some areas, we don't know about it. Because they have never really explained where the LAC lies according to their perception,” he noted.When asked if he thinks such village development is muscle-flexing on their part, he replied: “Certainly not, I won't call it muscle-flexing. With the development of these villages, they are trying to make sure that they reach out to their border areas, and it is something we should also be doing.”India was also concerned about its border area development and the government has released funds for BADP (Border Area Development Programme) projects, he mentioned.“In fact, we are encouraging people to go there and stay back in those villages because a large number of villages along the LAC are being vacated,” he explained. “Why are they being vacated? Because people find job opportunities, education, health infrastructure, more in the inner areas.” (With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-true-cds-refutes-reports-of-china-building-villages-on-indian-territory-101636678673239.html

It was in the reference of Veer Savarkar that Kangana was asked about her opinion on how Congress sees Veer Savarkar. In answer to the question, Kangana slammed the Congress by calling it 'an extension of the British' and that India got real freedom in 2014.

12-11-2021||India||SC asks Future Group to stop sale of retail assets to Reliance||The Supreme Court on Wednesday asked the Future Group to not proceed with a proposed $3.4 billion sale of its retail assets to Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) till its legal wrangle with Amazon.com.Inc is decided conclusively.“We cannot allow you to do anything in the meantime. We are very clear on it. Where is the question of your filing suits and SLPs (special leave petitions), and in the meantime you keep going ahead? What remains then? We hope you don’t proceed,” a bench, headed by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana told lawyers for the Future Group.“If you go on doing everything, what remains to be finally decided? If meetings etc go on, nothing remains. On the other hand, you can buy your own sweet time and go on filing appeals, suits etc,” added the bench, which also comprised justices AS Bopanna and Hima Kohli.The bench recounted that the court on September 9 passed an order by consent of both Amazon and Future, barring the Delhi high court, regulators and other statutory authorities in the country from passing any effective order on the Future-Reliance deal for the following four weeks.“That was an order passed after both of you agreed. We hope you don’t do anything now and will not proceed,” the bench told senior counsel Parag P Tripathi, who appeared for the Future Group.As Tripathi assured that the group would not proceed, the bench further asked him to take an adjournment before the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) where Future Group has pressed for convening meetings of its shareholders and creditors to seek approval on a sale proposal of the retailer’s assets to Reliance.The court fixed the matter for a detailed hearing on November 17 when it will also take up Future Group’s petition against the Delhi high court’s refusal to stay the Singapore arbitration tribunal’s October 21 ruling. The Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) restrained the Future Group from going ahead with its deal with Reliance. The high court on October 29 issued notice on the Future’s petition fixing the case for a hearing on a later date but declined to stay SIAC’s interim order in the meantime.On Wednesday, the bench was hearing Amazon’s plea to restrain all authorities, including NCLT, from allowing any measure that may facilitate the Future-Reliance deal till the matter is finally decided by the top court.Senior advocate Ranjit Kumar, appearing for Amazon, cited the Future Group’s attempt to conduct a meeting of shareholders and creditors for approval to sell its retail assets to Reliance, requesting the bench to issue a restraining order.Tripathi, for Future, argued that the process of meeting etc takes between 35-40 days and there is nothing that is happening just now. The bench, however, retorted that SIAC’s order is binding on the Future Group, as was also held by the Supreme Court’s judgment on August 6, and therefore, the retailer should choose its remedies in terms of this verdict.As Tripathi said that the Delhi high court is reluctant to pass any order in view of the Supreme Court’s interim restraining order on September 9, the bench remarked that it had not prevented the high court from examining the case on merit but the interim order was confined only on the aspect of coercive steps against Future Group’s directors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-asks-future-group-to-stop-sale-of-retail-assets-to-reliance-101636673389819.html
12-11-2021||India||In C’garh’s Cong vs BJP, a new twist over commission to probe deadly Maoist attack||RAIPUR: Five days after a judicial commission headed by former Chhattisgarh high court judge Prashant Kumar Mishra submitted its report on the 2013 Jhiram Ghati Maoist attack which wiped out the then Congress leadership in the state, the Chhattisgarh government on Thursday appointed a new chairman, added another member to the enquiry commission, and added new terms of reference.While the state government said the rationale for the change was that Mishra has become the chief justice of the Andhra Pradesh high court, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said the move was an attempt to obfuscate the findings of the report, which has not yet been tabled in the assembly or its contents released, and was a delaying tactic.The justice Prashant Kumar Mishra-led commission, constituted on May 28, 2013, by the then BJP government, submitted its findings to the Chhattisgarh governor Anusiya Uike on November 6.It is not clear what happens to this report. Asked by HT to clarify the status of this report, Raj Bhavan officials said the report is still with the governor and she will respond after going through it.To be sure, the Congress including chief minister Bhupesh Baghel objected to the commission directly submitting the report to the governor, pointing out that it should have been submitted to the state government. The ruling party also asked why the commission rushed to submit its report when in September it sought more time to complete the report.The commission was set up to probe the May 25, 2013 Maoist attack on a convoy of Congress leaders during the party’s Parivartan Rally’ in the Jhiram valley in Bastar district of Chhattisgarh, killing 29 people including then state Congress chief Nand Kumar Patel, former leader of opposition Mahendra Karma and former Union minister V C Shukla. The new order appoints Justice (retired) Satish K Agnihotri, former chief justice of Sikkim high court, as the new chairman of the commission and justice (retired) G Minhajuddin as a member. Both of them have served tenures as judges in the Chhattisgarh high court.In September, the government said the commission sought further time, and that a fresh report will be issued in six months.“…The state government was in receipt of the last communication made by the secretary of the commission dated September 23, 2021, by which the commission informed that the inquiry is incomplete and sought further time. The state government has decided to appoint two new members, former judges of high court as Justice Prashant Mishra has been transferred. State has further added three new points in the terms of reference (TOR) of the Commission,” Thursday’s notification said.The three terms of reference include that firstly whether sufficient medical aid was provided to the victims of the attack after the incident and secondly what appropriate steps were taken to prevent such incidents have been included in the probe. “The third term of reference will be determined according to circumstances by the commission or the state government,” the notification said.The BJP, however, asked why the report submitted five days ago has not been tabled for discussion.“The commission submitted its report only a while back, which is supposed to be tabled in the assembly and then discussed in the assembly. We don’t understand why there is a rush and disbelief in the submitted report. I don’t think the report will change if it’s submitted to the governor rather than the CM… The government should have waited till it gets tabled and discussed in the assembly. If they still had reservations they could have gone and appointed a new commission or changed its members,” said Dharamlal Kaushik, leader of opposition in the legislative assembly.Chhattisgarh government spokesperson and senior minister Ravindra Chaubey said the term of the single-member judicial commission expired due to administrative exigency after the transfer of justice Prashant Mishra. “The secretary of the aforementioned commission in his communication had informed the state government that the commission would require additional time to complete proceedings, therefore it has been decided to reconstitute the judicial commission by appointing two new members with a mandate to complete the proceedings in next six months,” said Chaubey adding that no new commission has been constituted, only the previously notified judicial commission has been reconstituted owing to administrative exigencies. “The state government has the power to appoint, dissolve or modify any commission or its terms of reference. Since the commission itself asked the state government to extend the time to complete the inquiry in its last communication, the state government has acted on the same,” said Sudeip Shrivastava, a lawyer, who represented state Congress before the commission. Kanak Tiwari, senior lawyer and former advocate general for the Chhattisgarh government said the state government has the jurisdiction to appoint the new members of a commission as per provisions of Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952.“It is an administrative issue. not a legal issue. The appointments were made as per the provisions of the Inquiry Act, which is an administrative Act and has no constitutional sanction. As per the Act, the state government has the jurisdiction to constitute judicial commissions or appoint any number of members for a commission… Irrespective of the fact that there was a report of commission earlier, the state government can make appointments,” Kanak Tiwari, senior lawyer and former advocate general of Chhattisgarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-c-garh-s-cong-vs-bjp-a-new-twist-over-commission-to-probe-deadly-maoist-attack-101636665220414.html
12-11-2021||India||CISF to set up panel at airports for issues relating to the differently-abled||NEW DELHI: The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) will come up with provisions for security checking of persons with disabilities (PWDs) at airports and as the first step, will set up a committee of stakeholders with reference to the issues faced by PWDs, it was decided after an outreach session between disabled groups and top aviation officials including those from the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) and the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA).“The aim of this conference was to discuss standardisation of the processes across all the airports under CISF security cover in dealing with PWDs, and to minimise the problems faced by them during pre-embarkation security checks at the airports,” a statement from CISF said.On interacting with the NGOs, senior officers said that the agency tried to establish communication with the end-users, explaining the security compulsions and the best possible efforts being made by them (at the airports) to address problems of passengers with special needs. Existing security guidelines for frisking differently-abled passengers and their equipment (such as wheelchairs, prosthetics and others) were brought in by BCAS following the 2016 aircraft blast in Somalia where a wheelchair-bound passenger was suspected to have carried out a blast in the aircraft after evading security at Mogadishu airport.Based on the existing guidelines prescribed by BCAS for security checks of PWDs, CISF highlighted what and how the CISF undertakes security checks of such passengers.“There will be an increased focus on training and sensitisation of the personnel handling the issues of the PWDs,” CISF said. This comes as there were some passenger complaints alleging unfriendly behaviour from the security personnel, in the past. “Representatives of NGOs were invited to share their experiences and put forth their expectations from CISF aviation security group. They were also encouraged to give suggestions, which would ease the process of security checks for PWDs. Our aim is to engage with organisations related to PWDs in order to understand their problems and also put forth solutions to issues, permanent dialogues,” said MA Ganapathy, director general, CISFVaishnavi Jayakumar of Disability Rights Alliance, a Chennai based NGO, said, “The guidelines that exist from our end are disabled friendly, but the problem is that there are differences in security protocols which also is leading to confusion as to which guidelines are to be followed.”“Added to this is the lack of awareness in Indians of the disability experience. In airports, there are wheelchair users not only because they are differently-abled but because of other reasons such as age factor. However, people who are conducting security screening may not understand the difference between such passengers and expect all wheelchair-bound passengers to stand during the security check. This however improves with interaction and awareness which we stressed in the interaction. Now, BCAS has to make sure that all the inputs are in line with civil aviation rules, disability law and the recent aviation accessibility standards,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cisf-to-set-up-panel-at-airports-for-issues-relating-to-the-differentlyabled-101636662520194.html
12-11-2021||India||Goa minister ignores BJP diktat, says will support wife, friend’s election bid||PANAJI: Goa minister and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Michael Lobo, who pledged his support to his wife and a friend in the state elections leading to red faces in his party, on Thursday defended his announcement, saying people are looking for good candidates and indicted certain sitting MLAs for non-performance. He did not, however, name anyone.“People of Goa want good candidates so that their issues are addressed and solved whether it is water or electricity. Today people are fighting for basic necessities. These are good candidates. People across Goa are looking for good candidates. Today the MLAs are not performing, they are not available to the people,” Lobo told reporters on Thursday explaining his unusual announcement just a day earlier.On Wednesday, Lobo, a two-time BJP lawmaker, announced that his wife Delilah Lobo will ‘most certainly’ contest from the Siolim constituency (which borders the Calangute constituency he represents) and threw his weight behind Sudhir Kandolkar, a Congressman who he said he will back irrespective of the party Kandolkar contests from. “The candidates who are going to contest are seated here -- Delilah, Sudhir Kandolkar from Mapusa. I think that this time 100% the people will get him elected. Delilah will contest from Siolim with the blessings of the people,” Lobo said at the event.To be sure, Lobo did not say that he expected his two candidates to be given a BJP ticket. but only underlined who will have his support on the two seats, Siolim and Mapusa.On Thurday, he reiterated this point as well.“I am not asking for tickets for anybody. I’m saying good candidates should be given tickets, these are our names. Let’s see which party (they will fight on) later”.Lobo, 45, was made a minister in the Pramod Sawant cabinet after the BJP snapped ties with the Goa Forward Party in 2019 and asked its ministers to step down.Lobo’s comments came as a huge embarrassment for the BJP coming as they do, despite a directive from the Goa BJP president Sadanand Shet Tanavade who has, on more than one occasion, asked party leaders and ticket aspirants to respect the party’s internal process to hand out tickets.After Lobo still went ahead, Tanavade declined to comment, saying “there is nothing new to add” to what he has already said.“I have spoken in the past on this issue... I do not wish to comment further,” Sadanand Shet Tanavade said when asked about Lobo’s announcement.In the past, Tanavade has underscored that the decision to hand out tickets is taken after a due process involving a recommendation from the party’s state unit to the national parliamentary board which takes a final decision. “Until that process is completed, no person can decide for himself that he is contesting on a BJP ticket,” Tanavade said.Lobo’s decision to announce his wife as a candidate for the upcoming polls, irrespective of whether she gets the BJP ticket has ruffled feathers of former BJP MLA Dayanand Mandrekar, who lost his seat to Vinoda Paliencar of the Goa Forward Party in 2017, but is now keen to protect his turf and secure a BJP ticket either for himself or his son.Lobo said his wife decided that she will contest from Siolim and the decision was hers, not his and that the initial feedback she received from the constituency was positive, which is what prompted him to decide to back her. Like Michael Lobo’s Calangute constituency it borders, Siolim constituency is also a tourism centric seat and includes hotspots like Anjuna, Chapora and Siolim itself.In Mapusa, the headquarters of the Bardez taluka, Lobo has vowed to back Sudhir Kandolkar, a former member of the BJP and a close aide of former deputy chief minister Francis D’Souza who died in February 2019. In the bye election that ensued, the BJP gave the party ticket to D’Souza’s son Joshua provoking Kandolkar to switch sides, join the Congress and contest against Joshua. Joshua won by a thousand-odd votes, but the margin was far less than the 10,000 or so votes his father used to win by.Kandolkar, who remains a Congressman, said he was expecting the party’s ticket for the upcoming election has welcomed Lobo’s loud support, saying it was a boost. If there are others willing to back him, they are welcome to do so as well, he added.Michael Lobo’s public announcement has led to ripples in the Congress as well where some leaders hinted they hoped the public declaration isn’t a precursor to Lobo crossing sides. Among them is Lobo’s rival Agnelo Fernandes, a former Calangute MLA who has been looking at another shot at getting back into the assembly.Fernandes stepped up on Wednesday, declaring that he was determined to “fight the forces out to destroy Goa” even as he accused Lobo of being in cahoots with the “builder and casino lobby”.But the BJP’s problems are not limited to Lobo seeking to expand his fief.In Mandrem, a constituency that is home to the beaches of Morjim, Arambol and Tiracol former chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar and member of the Goa BJP executive is up against sitting MLA Dayanand Sopte who has “officially” launched his campaign, complete with BJP flags.Sopte, who was earlier with the BJP, quit and contested against Parsekar on a Congress ticket. He however, resigned his seat won on a Congress ticket, joined the BJP and contested again. He was reelected.To his friends and associates, Parsekar has made it clear that he will not go down without a fight.Parsekar’s determination to give himself a fighting chance is something, one BJP leader acknowledged, that has the party leadership concerned.The BJP holds a clear majority of 27 MLAs in the 39-member house after a Congress MLA resigned to join the TMC reducing the strength of the assembly from 40 to 39. The Congress holds four seats, the Goa Forward three while the MGP and NCP hold one each. Independent canddates hold another three.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-minister-ignores-bjp-diktat-says-will-support-wife-friend-s-election-bid-101636660780213.html
12-11-2021||India||Bihar police arrests 823 engaged in illicit liquor trade after hooch deaths climb to 41||After recent reports of several deaths due to consumption of illicit liquor in dry Bihar and mounting attack from the Opposition on the alleged nexus behind the thriving liquor trade, the Bihar police has launched a coordinated drive against the liquor mafia and raided more than 1300 locations including Muzaffarpur, Samastipur, Gopalganj, West Champaran and East Champaran. Police teams have arrested 823 people in the last 48 hours. Nearly 41 people died due to consumption of spurious liquor in four districts during the festive season. The incidents pushed the death toll due to consumption of suspected spurious liquor in Bihar close to 106 till date. According to a senior IPS official of the state police headquarters (SPH), the liquor mafia have changed their strategy to avoid the risk of smuggling liquor from outside the state and instead have begun manufacturing spurious liquor in Bihar. In Muzaffarpur, police arrested 400 people, including five members of Panchayat Samiti, and unearthed three re-bottling units. Police recovered 8000 empty bottles, seals, cork, wrappers, packing machine and spirits. “We have registered 150 FIRs with 40 police stations and nabbed 400 people who were involved in the spurious liquor trade,” said Muzaffarpur SSP Jayant Kant. He said that the second such incident occurred at Manipur-Narottam panchayat under Kanti police station ahead of the panchayat election scheduled on November 15. A liquor party was organised in the house of a mukhia candidate to lure voters and it went horribly wrong, claiming the lives of six people. Earlier on October 29, six people had died while some others were in serious condition after consuming suspected spurious liquor at Rupauli village under Saraiya police station. Following the incident, police carried out raids at Rupauli and neighbouring Vishhar-patti village and arrested four people including newly elected ward member Amit Kumar. The liquor party was organised by Amit in one of the victim’s houses identified as Dhiresh Kumar alias Gultu. Reports from Gopalganj claim that police have arrested 275 people registered 105 FIRs after the death of 13 people at Mahmadpur police station area and seized 34 vehicles. The police also raided the house of one Karan Kumar at Harpur village under Town police station and recovered new wrappers of UP brand IMFL, polythene, pouches and empty bottles. “After the incident raids have been conducted in several places in the district in which 11 people involved in the hooch tragedy have been arrested,” said Gopalganj SP Anand Kumar, adding that the district administration on Thursday launched an awareness drive among the Chhath Puja devotees and warned them against spurious liquor. In Samastipur, at least seven people including a BSF personnel and an army jawan died, while six minors were in critical condition and two of them lost their vision at Rupauli, the police arrested 65 people and lodged 32 FIRs so far. In East Champaran, police have lodged 83 FIRs after the arrest of 92 people and recovered 11,000 litres of liquor including 8000 litres spirit, said SP Navin Chandra Jha. Change in Modus OperandiPolice officials said the unscrupulous elements engaged in illicit liquor trade have changed their modus operandi by mixing sedative tablets with spirits to prepare spurious liquor, a reason why it is leading to poisoning and other health problems. Another new facet in the illegal liquor trade which has emerged, lately in Bihar, is the mushrooming of localised spurious liquor units as IMFL (Indian Made Foreign Liquor) bottles being smuggled from states like Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, West Bengal and Nepal has been curbed to an extent due to police crackdown on smugglers. As per latest police records, 6,852 smugglers from Punjab, Haryana, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Nepal have been arrested in the last five years since prohibition in Bihar from April, 2016. The cases of arrested people are in different stages of trial with many lodged in different jails in the state, police said. “The liquor mafia has changed their modus operandi, as bringing Indian made foreign liquor (IMFL) from other parts of the state was proving risky following the arrest of around 6,852 outsiders from Punjab, Haryana, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Nepal. They have now set up manufacturing units in Muzaffarpur and Gopalganj,” said the official, adding that ever since the liquor tragedy broke out in four districts, more than 800 people involved in liquor trade have been arrested in connection with 698 cases. A joint team of Bihar police and excise officials recovered 16,230 litres IMFL, 4,510 litres country made liquor, 85 vehicles besides mahua seeds and flowers. The Opposition meanwhile has been attacking the government for its failure to arrest liquor flow in the state due to faulty implementation of the prohibition law, police-mafia nexus and sought its review. Leader of Opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav described the recent hooch tragedies as “organised killings” and asked if it was not true that liquor was being supplied through police stations. “What is the result of thousands of meetings to review the impact of prohibition when this is the ground reality? Under whose patronage is the liquor mafia getting by so emboldened,” he asked through a tweet. Congress MLC and spokesman Premchandra Mishra, too, has been questioning the policy. “It is no more time to review prohibition. The time has come to have a rethink on it, as so many deaths have amply proved that checking smuggling is not this government’s cup of tea,” he added. However, chief minister Nitish Kumar has been trying to refute them by saying that prohibition in the state was imposed after a unanimous decision of the state legislature and that all should work to make it successful. He has also held review meetings to take stock of the situation and warned that those involved will not be spared. The issue is again likely to generate heat during the forthcoming winter session.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-police-arrests-823-engaged-in-illicit-liquor-trade-after-hooch-deaths-climb-to-41-101636659100034.html
12-11-2021||India||Cases under SC/ST act: Dalits continue to face discrimination in Karnataka||It was the first day after his college reopened after the Covid-induced lockdown and 21-year-old Dilip Kumar decided to stop at Sri Anjaneya temple near Doddabalapura on the outskirts of Bengaluru city before heading to his college on October 31. His mobile phone rang as he was offering prayers and the priest asked him to get out of the temple. He obliged, but when he returned after taking a call outside, he saw a temple official, Prakash, using a phone inside the temple. When Kumar questioned Prakash, a barrage of abuse followed, and he was thrashed at the temple office. Muni Anjinappa, a Dalit leader of the Praja Vimochana Chaluvali who has been helping Kumar with the case, said that what followed the abuses was more brutal. “First of all, the abuses were caste-related, and they kept asking who he (Kumar) was to question Prakash. Then seven people dragged this young man to the temple office. They hit him and even gagged him using a piece of cloth. He is still undergoing treatment,” said Anjinappa. So far, two people have been arrested in the case. Anjinappa said that they will continue their protest until all suspects are behind the bar. Police said they were trying to track the remaining five accused in the case. Assault on Kumar was the third reported case in a over month where a Dalit man was punished for entering a temple. On September 14, a 24-year-old Dalit man was forced to offer a feast worth ₹11,000 allegedly as a punishment for entering a temple at a village in north Karnataka’s Koppal district. According to a senior district police officer, after a theft was reported in the village temple a few months ago, the temple’s priests restricted entry only to themselves. The Dalit man had taken a vow to conduct some prayers in the temple. On September 14, he entered the temple for prayers. When the priests came to know about it the next day, they demanded that he make amends by offering a feast. In this case, Karatagi police filed a suo motu case against eight people —the priest, Revanayyaswamy, Shekharappa, Sharanappa, Prashant, Basavaraj, Durgesh, and Kadappa Nayak—under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Act, 2015 and sections 504, 149 of the Indian Penal Code, after protests from a local organisation. All suspects got bail soon after arrests. In another incident on September 4, parents of a Dalit boy were fined ₹23,000 after their 2-year-old son entered a Hanuman temple on his birthday at Miyapura village near Hanumasagar in Koppal district. According to people aware of the incident, Dalits in the village are not allowed inside the temples and they only pray from outside. In this case, however, no complaint was filed as after a mediation meeting held by police, the temple authorities did not pursue the incident following an apology by the Dalit family. “No case was registered,” said a local police officer, who was not willing to be identified as he was not authorised to speak to media. The government is yet to release data on the SC/ST population in the state. However leaked documents from the caste census in the state claims that SC/ST population constitutes the largest community in the state. Dalit activists in the state said that such incidents are being reported in urban and rural areas of Karnataka. “Generally such atrocities are associated in the rural parts of the state. But if you look at the recent cases, they are reported around Bengaluru, the so called IT capital of the country,” said Mohanraj M, a Dalit activist. Activists also say that these are the incidents that have been reported but there are several unreported cases across the state, which show that discrimination against Dalits is rampant in the educationally advanced state of Karnataka. “In this August, a Dalit boy, around 9-year-old, was pushed by a temple trustee and he broke his leg. The incident happened in a village in Devanahalli, not too far from the international airport. His crime was that he went to get prasada (food offering) during a temple festival. The case didn’t come out for weeks because the family was scared. It was only after we interfered an FIR was registered. So, you can imagine, how many more such unreported cases there are,” said Anjinappa. The incidents of atrocities against Dalits in the state are not just limited to temple entry. On June 10, two Dalit men attempted suicide after they were denied haircuts by people from upper castes in Koppal district. Humiliated and assaulted for asking for a haircut, the two Dalit siblings had consumed pesticides, activists said. Both men are out of danger now. But, police have not taken action against the upper castes, who discriminated against them. Sanna Hanumantha, a Dalit activist in the district, said the brothers were humiliated by the villagers twice. “Two days before the attack, they had approached the barbers for a haircut, but they were turned back. The barbers told the brothers that they will not cut the hair of the lower caste people. The villagers also warned the Dalit men against entering the upper-caste area,” said Hanumantha. According to him, the men from the Dalit community used to travel to the town 4 km away for a haircut. “Since there was a lockdown in effect, they were not able to travel. So, they requested the barbers again, but they didn’t budge. The two men felt humiliated after they were abused the second time they went for the hair and consumed pesticide,” he said. Activists in the district said that this was one of the many instances of caste discrimination in Koppal. “If I have to get a haircut, I will have to go to the town because in the village the upper caste won’t let us get the hair cut in the barbershop. Similarly, we are not allowed inside the restaurants. You will find this in every village in Koppal,” said Nilakanda S, a Dalit activist from Koppal. Nilakanda, who is a graduate in computer science, says that for job opportunities to drinking water, the Dalits have to struggle in this rural part of the state. “We have problems in even getting borewells dug or getting water connection,” he alleged. Even the state’s track record in investigating atrocities against SC/STs has been poor. According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), the conviction rate in cases registered under the SC and ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act is just 4.6%. In 2020, including the cases from previous years, only 22 convictions were reported in the state, while the number of acquittals stood at 353. In 2019, the conviction rate was 3.8%. In comparison with the neighbouring states, the conviction rate in cases of atrocities against SC/STs in Karnataka has been poor. While neighbouring Andhra Pradesh recorded a conviction rate of 10% and Tamil Nadu 25.2%, the conviction rate in Karnataka was 4.6%. Karnataka has been reporting over 1,000 cases of Dalit atrocities every year. According to NCRB data, 1,325 cases of atrocities against SC/STs were registered in 2018. In 2019 and 2020, these numbers stood at 1,504 and 1,398. The data also showed that among the states, Karnataka transferred cases related to SC/ST atrocities to another state or agency. The state transferred 41 cases registered under SC/ST Act to different agencies for investigation in 2020. An ADGP rank officer who didn’t want to be named claimed that that out-of-court settlements and false cases are some of the reasons for the low conviction rate. He said that special officers are being designated to investigate the cases of discrimination against Dalits. Reacting to incidents of atrocities against Dalits in the state, the head of SC/ST commission and BJP legislator Nehru Olankar said, “We are aware of these incidents and the police are taking strict action in these cases. In all incidents, police have registered cases and we want to assure people that action will be taken if such discrimination takes place in any part of the state,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cases-under-sc-st-act-dalits-continue-to-face-discrimination-in-karnataka-101636657242456.html

12-11-2021||India||New aerospace, defence policy in state by year-end: Karnataka minister||Large and medium Industries Minister Murugesh Nirani has said that Karnataka will have a new aerospace and defence policy by this year-end.Making a strong pitch for investments in the sector, he said the government is planning to offer enhanced incentives to MSMEs to provide a level playing field and make them competitive as part of the new aerospace and defence policy.Though Karnataka’s aerospace and defence policy is valid until 2023, the state government is pushing for an updated policy.The new policy will be introduced as part of the government’s “proactive approach to update our policy to provide a key push for this important sector,” Nirani was quoted as saying by his office, at the Lockheed Martin’s 8th Annual India Suppliers Conference late on Wednesday.He also said that the government is also in the process of setting up a 1,200-acre Defence and Aerospace park in Devanahalli, which may also be officially announced at the end of December.The new policy would concentrate on drawing original equipment manufacturers (OEM) to the state and the government is looking to create clusters not only in Bengaluru but other parts of the state like Tumkuru, where the helicopter complex under Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) is coming up, Chamarajnagar and even Chitradurga which is turning into an important hub for units of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).Noting that Karnataka is already leading the realm when it comes to a strong industrial base, Nirani said, “Our Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) is approximately ₹17 lakh crore and accounts for the highest total exports among all states in India.” Elaborating further on Karnataka’s predominant position in the Defence and Aerospace sector, the minister said 25 per cent of India’s aircraft and spacecraft industry is based in Karnataka.“More than 67 per cent of all aircraft and helicopters production for Defence services is done in Karnataka and it contributes to 65 per cent of the country’s aerospace related exports. We are home to more than 2000 Small & micro enterprises along with 70 per cent of India’s supplier base which execute subcontracting work for the Defence PSUs,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-aerospace-defence-policy-in-state-by-year-end-karnataka-minister-101636657240004.html
12-11-2021||India||PM asked me not to worry about Bitcoin case, Bommai after meeting Modi||Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai said on Thursday said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had conveyed to him not to worry about the Bitcoin scandal and instead focus on developmental work in the state.“When I tried to speak to him about the issue, he (PM) said don’t break your head over it. You (Bommai) work honestly and with dedication for the people and everything will be alright,” Bommai said, sharing what Modi had told the chief minister.The statements come even as the allegations and counter allegations over the Bitcoin scandal continue to rage on in the southern state where the Bharatiya Janata Party and Congress have locked horns over the alleged irregularities.Bommai had met the PM on Thursday after the chief minister made a surprise visit to the capital on Wednesday afternoon.There have been at least three letters written to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) by various individuals and some anonymously, adding to speculation that the complaints were being made from within the party.However, the letters could not be independently verified.The mode of writing anonymous letters from within the BJP to the party high command is not unusual as former chief minister BS Yediyurappa was at the receiving end of such complaints during his turbulent tenure between 2019 and July 2021.The letter, that has gone viral on social media, has been written by a Sachin Mamane who names Congress MLA, NA Harris, and his two sons, Loganath, an influential businessman from Bengaluru, revenue minister R Ashok and several others who are allegedly part of a huge Bitcoin racket to launder ill-gotten money. The veracity of this letter could not be verified independently.Congress state president DK Shivakumar on Thursday said that if the BJP did not have anything to hide, why is the party not raising the issue that the names of officials and even Congress legislators are mentioned in the letter.“They (BJP and Bommai) are speaking on specific points but are leaving out most of the details,” Shivakumar said.He added that he is not sure of the letter or its contents but the entire episode must be investigated.The BJP has called the Congress ‘fabricators’ misleading the people over the alleged scam.A hacker named Srikrishna or Sriki is at the heart of the entire scandal.Bommai had earlier said that Sriki had been arrested in a drug-related case in 2018 when Siddaramaiah was the chief minister, hinting that the latter was involved in the case and trying to deflect the issue by smearing the name of the former.Siddaramaiah said that he had not mentioned Bommai’s name anywhere but the evasive behaviour of the chief minister was raising suspicion.Narayanswamy of the BJP on Thursday said that Siddaramaiah was trying to build the entire case on lies. “There have been several sessions of the legislature. They do not have the capability to present even a shred of evidence in the house,” Narayanswamy said.Bommai said he met home minister Amit Shah on Thursday. Whether Shah asked about the cryptocurrency case, he said, “I could not discuss much with him as the interaction was brief. The issue of Bitcoin did not come up during the interaction. The home minister has all the central agencies and would have all the information regarding the issue.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pmasked-me-not-to-worry-about-bitcoin-case-bommai-after-meeting-modi-101636656519935.html
12-11-2021||India||TRS, BJP in political slugfest over paddy procurement||The Telangana Rashtra Samithi and the Bharatiya Janata Party are at loggerheads over procurement of paddy from farmers in the state this season, which is snowballing into a major controversy. For the last few days, farmers have been queuing up before the procurement centres set up by the state government to sell their paddy. With Telangana recording 10.6 million tonnes of paddy production this season, heavy loads of the produce have been flooding the market, making it difficult for the authorities to procure the grain at the centres. The authorities are issuing tokens to the farmers to bring their produce to the procurement centres at the prescribed time, instead of waiting there for days together. The Telangana government has been demanding that the Centre procure the entire paddy produced during the season through Food Corporation of India, but the Centre has refused to buy more than the prescribed limit of 6 million tonnes. This has led to a slugfest between the TRS and the BJP in the state. On Thursday, the state BJP organised protest demonstrations before all the district collectorates, demanding that the state government procure the paddy from farmers completely, instead of blaming it on the Centre. “The Centre has made it clear that it would purchase 60 lakh tonnes. It is the responsibility of the state to procure the remaining quantity,” state BJP president Bandi Sanjay. He reminded that it was chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao who had promised the farmers that the state would purchase every grain of paddy through procurement centres. The TRS, too, announced a counter-agitation programme, following a call given by the chief minister on Monday. The party leaders and cadre would stage demonstrations and dharnas all over the state on Friday, demanding that the Centre purchase the entire quantity of paddy produced this season. “The Centre is procuring 100 per cent paddy from Punjab to appease the agitating farmers there. Why is it not doing it in Telangana? Moreover, the Centre has also refused to buy even a single kg of rice from Telangana during the Rabi season and got a written commitment from us to this effect,” KCR pointed out. He demanded that the BJP leaders bring pressure on the Centre to procure all the paddy produced in the state. Rythu Bandhu Samithi president Palla Rajeshwar Reddy said the BJP’s dharnas were meaningless. He said the state government had opened 3,550 procurement centres across the state and would open more in the next few days. “Paddy procurement has been going on at a brisk pace at all the centres and money is being deposited in the accounts of the farmers. So far, the government has spent ₹1,000 crore on paddy procurement,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trs-bjp-in-political-slugfest-over-paddy-procurement-101636656402445.html
12-11-2021||India||Salman Khurshid’s remark on Hindutva in book sparks row||A controversy erupted on Thursday over former Union minister Salman Khurshid’s alleged comparison of Hindutva to Islamic terror with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) criticising the Congress leader.In his book Sunrise over Ayodhya: Nationhood in Our Times, which was released on Wednesday, Khurshid referred to Sanatan Dharma and classical Hinduism known to sages and saints “being pushed aside by robust version of Hindutva, by all standards a political version similar to the jihadist Islam of groups like ISIS and Boko Haram of recent years.”The Congress distanced itself from Khurshid’s comment.Senior party leader Ghulam Nabi Azad tweeted that comparing Hindutva to Jihadist Islam was an exaggeration.“In Mr. Salman Khurshid’s new book, we may not agree with Hindutva as a political ideology distinct from composite culture of Hinduism, but comparing Hindutva with ISIS and Jihadist Islam is factually wrong and an exaggeration,” he said.The BJP lashed out at Khurshid. Union minister Pralhad Joshi said, “Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi are desperately trying to appease Hindus by touring temples. I would like to ask them- when and what action will they take against Salman Khurshid who have insulted the beliefs of Hindus?” Party spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia said the Congress was “weaving a web” against Hindus. “All this happens at the behest of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. Earlier the term Hindu terrorism was invented in the Congress office,” he told reporters.The Shiv Sena, which runs a coalition government with the Congress in Maharashtra, also condemned the book.Khurshid defended himself.“I have not called these guys terrorists, I have just said they are similar in distorting religion. What Hindutva has done, it has pushed aside Sanatan Dharma and Hinduism and it has taken over a robust, aggressive position similar to Boko Haram and those other guys,” he said.On Azad’s remarks, he said, “Exaggeration means it is somewhat like them. That’s what he feels. Distortion is done by Boko Haram and distortion is also done by Hindutva. I said we disagree with Hindutva, and so I think Azad and I are on the same side.” A Delhi-based lawyer also filed a complaint with Delhi Police seeking registration of FIR against Khurshid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/salman-khurshid-s-remark-on-hindutva-in-book-sparks-row-101636656401247.html
12-11-2021||India||‘There can’t be cover up’: Kerala high court to govt in ‘antique dealer’ fraud case||“There cannot be a cover up,” Kerala High Court said to the state government on Thursday with regard to the ongoing investigation into self-styled antique dealer Monson Mavunkal’s activities and his alleged links to senior police officers.“The concern of the court is that there cannot be any cover up. To that extent the court will be watching the investigation. I want a proper investigation. There should be no cover up,” Justice Devan Ramachandran said.The high court said that “prima facie there appears to be something much more than what meets the eye” and though an investigation was going on, the question was whether agencies from outside the state should also be brought in due to the allegations against senior police officials, one of whom according to news reports has been suspended. It directed that the Enforcement Directorate (ED) be made a party in the matter after the state government said it was not opposed to the same.The Director General of Prosecution, appearing for the state and the police, said he has not received any information regarding suspension of any officer, but he saw in news reports that Inspector General of Police (IG) G Lakshman has been suspended for allegedly aiding Mavunkal.The court was hearing a plea by the antiques dealer’s former driver-cum-mechanic alleging harassment by his former employer and some police officers close to him after he made certain disclosures to police in connection with a cheating case against Mavunkal.The court, during the hearing, questioned the state police as to why no action was taken under the Antiquities and Art Treasures Act, 1972 against Mavunkal after former DGP Loknath Behera raised doubts regarding genuineness of the artistic treasures and antiques at the controversial antique dealer’s house subsequent to his visit there.“He (Mavunkal) was allowed to run free all this time and now you have POCSO and rape cases against him. Proper policing would have prevented this,” Justice Devan Ramachandran said to the police.The court said action under the Antiquities Act back in 2019 after Behera’s visit to Mavunkal’s house would have put a stop to his various allegedly illegal activities.The court also noted that no action was taken against Mavunkal even after an intelligence report of January last year said that he was frequently going abroad for dealing in antiquities even though he had no licence for the same.“These things certainly ought to have alerted the police. If it were some ordinary citizen, he would have been jailed long back. But he (Mavunkal) was allowed to run free and he even had access to the office of then State Police Chief (SPC),” the court observed.In response to the court’s query as to who invited Behera and Additional Director General of Police (HQ) Manoj Abraham to the house of Mavunkal, the state said that they were invited there by a woman -- Anitha Pullayil -- who claimed to be the Global Coordinator of the Women’s Wing of Pravasi Malayali Federation, an organisation which purportedly worked for the interests of Indians abroad.The state also said that just because someone claimed to have antiques, action under the Antiquities Act cannot be taken as no one believed Mavunkal’s claims.The court, however, rejected this contention saying a responsible police officer should have taken action when someone was making such claims -- like possessing ‘Tipu’s throne’ or ‘Moses staff’. It listed the matter on November 19, giving time to the petitioner to implead the ED as a party and for filing an additional affidavit.The court had earlier also raised questions related to Mavunkal’s alleged links with senior police officials in the state.State Police Chief Anil Kant had earlier filed an affidavit in court stating that former state police chief Behera’s visit to Mavunkal’s residence in May 2019 was “unscheduled” and purely out of interest to look at the items of historical importance that the latter claimed to possess and not to give him any undue mileage in society.At the time Behera visited Mavunkal’s residence on May 11, 2019, the latter was known in social media and the public as a doctor and philanthropist and there was no intelligence report available about the dubious nature of the articles in his house, the SPC had said in the affidavit.The affidavit was filed in response to the high court’s query to Kant on October 5 as to whether he trusts the police under his command to carry out a proper investigation into the complaints against Mavunkal when allegations are “flying thick and high” against police officers of various ranks in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/there-can-t-be-cover-up-kerala-high-court-to-govt-in-antique-dealer-fraud-case-101636656399941.html
12-11-2021||India||Winter session: Opposition looks to firm strategy||After fiery speeches by various Trinamool Congress leaders against the Congress, and the latter’s barbs aimed at Mamata Banerjee’s party, the two opposition parties now face the task of coordinating their strategies in the coming winter session of Parliament.In the last session, the Congress (which has 52 members in the Lok Sabha and 34 in the Rajya Sabha)), the TMC (22 in the Lok Sabha and 12 in the RS) , and other opposition parties were on the same page on most of the issues and their united protests over farm laws led to a near-washout of the monsoon session.A divided Opposition, in the past, had come handy for the government to pass key bills on Triple Talaq, bifurcation of J&K and scrapping of Article 370 in the Upper House, where the Bharatiya-Janata Party led NDA still doesn’t have the majority.The winter session of Parliament is scheduled from November 29 to December 23.But in the last two months, the exodus from the Congress to the Trinamool and the latter’s public criticism of the former has rattled even the Congress’ central leadership, according to two senior Congress leaders.In September, West Bengal chief minister, in one of her poll rallies, said, “The Congress is scared. They sometimes manage you (BJP) but you cannot manage Mamata Banerjee. TMC will work across the country even as the Congress couldn’t.”A month later, Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala reacted to Banerjee’s visit to Goa, where elections are due early next year, and said, “Politics is not tourism. In a democracy, any party can contest anywhere but are they (TMC) helping BJP in Goa?”“It will not be an easy job to bring all Opposition parties on the same page this time. But we are hopeful that the larger issue of tackling the BJP in parliament might prove to be a key factor,” said a senior Congress leader.A Trinamool floor leader, when asked about floor coordination, quipped, “There’s lots of time left (to work things out).”Top opposition leaders are expected to meet ahead of the session to discuss the floor management plan apart from broader issues.But while Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has already announced that his party wants to debate the Rafale deal and the Pegasus spyware controversy, some opposition parties might not be interested in the Rafale issue.“Rafale is an old issue... We must look now to fresh matters of national importance,” said a senior opposition MP, who doesn’t belong to the Congress.Behind the scenes, communication channels are open and buzzing between the TMC and the Congress, according to according to leaders of both parties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/winter-session-opposition-looks-to-firm-strategy-101636656219183.html
12-11-2021||India||Landslide risk not enough reason to halt Char Dham project: Centre to SC||he risk of landslides cannot deter the army from giving up on the construction of border roads, the Centre told the Supreme Court on Thursday, defending its application to construct all-weather roads with 10 metre width as part of its Char Dham project in Uttarakhand. Some of these roads, the Centre has said, are strategically important ones leading to the Indo-China border.The Court was hearing two applications by separate departments of the Union government, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) and the Ministry of Road, Transport and Highways (MoRTH) for modifying an earlier top court order of September 2020 that did not allow roads with a width higher than 5.5 metre as part of the Char Dham project. That order relied on a 2018 circular of MoRTH providing for roads in hilly regions to be 5.5m wide. However, another MoRTH circular in December 2020 allowed 7m width for feeder roads on the India-China border.Appearing for the Centre in the matter on which orders were reserved by the Court on Thursday, Attorney General KK Venugopal presented the concerns of the Indian Army, the reason why the Centre sought modification of road width, and the steps taken by government to mitigate the risk of landslides in the stretches where the expansion is sought.“Landslides are a reality across the country and we have to live with it. The question is will the army drop its hands and say landslides will take place and so will give up on developing mountain roads. No army in the world will say that. If we have to live with it, we have to use all the technology at our command to mitigate it,” Venugopal said.Parts of Uttarakhand witnessed landslides caused by extreme rainfall last month. With the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change saying in a recent report that instances of extreme weather events will increase as a result of the climate crisis, and with rampant development in the hill state cutting hill sides and removing original vegetation, experts say the risk of landslides has increased.The Centre’s submissions came a day after the Court enquired about steps taken by the Union government to address the risk posed due to landslides in landslide prone zones on the three strategic roads under consideration of the court.Informing the court of the mitigation measures undertaken by the Centre, the country’s top law officer said that on September 15, 2020, a week after the order on maintaining 5.5m width, the government signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Geological Survey of India (GSI) for carrying out geological studies in the region on which work had commenced. He further stated that in January, another MoU was entered with Defence Geo-Informatics Research Establishment, a premier lab of DRDO, for preparing sustainable landslide mitigation measures for the national highways. In addition, the Tehri Hydroelectric Development Corporation (THDC) has been hired as project consultant to cater to needs of slope restoration during the expansion.The bench of Justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, Surya Kant and Vikram Nath found these MoUs to be recent and said, “Your MoUs with GSI, THDC and DRDO are as late as January while the work on the project started much earlier. Perhaps now that the government is undertaking this study to identify vulnerable spots, it should precede construction.”The plea of the Centre was opposed by NGO Citizens for Green Doon on whose plea the road width was restricted to 5.5m. Senior advocate Colin Gonsalves reiterated that the fragile ecosystem of Himalayas cannot tolerate such wide roads and there are consequences that come with such expansion, landslides being one of them.The Court directed Gonsalves to submit suggestions on what precautions are to be observed by Centre, in the event the court agrees to accept the stand of the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/landslide-risk-not-enough-reason-to-halt-char-dham-project-centre-to-sc-101636656041442.html

So, people living in low-lying areas and the farming community have to be cautious,” said chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy, in a video conference with the officials. He instructed that the officials monitor the flood situation from time to time.State disaster management authority (SDMA), who attended an emergency meeting convened by chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy said surface winds with a speed of 60-70 km per hour along with heavy rains wreaked havoc in Nellore, Prakasam, Chittoor and Kadapa districts since Thursday morning.

12-11-2021||India||Legal notices served as Malik, Fadnavis continue to lock horns||In yet another day of accusations and countercharges, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and state minister Nawab Malik on Thursday raised questions over the large haul of drugs seized from Gujarat in the recent weeks and said that Gujarat’s role in the country’s illegal narcotics supply chain should be investigated by central agencies.Later in the day, Malik’s daughter, Nilofer Khan, sent a legal notice to Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Devendra Fadnavis and his wife Amruta, seeking an apology from them for claiming that her husband, Sameer, had possessed drugs. This was soon followed by Amruta Fadnavis sending a legal notice to Malik demanding deletion of tweets pertaining to Fadnavis’ alleged connections with drug dealers, within 48 hours.Since Monday, Fadnavis and Malik have traded accusations of wrongdoing. On Thursday, Malik raised questions over the recent seizure of drugs worth ₹313 crore in Devbhumi Dwarka, and asked if “a drug game (racket)” was “being run from Gujarat”.“The Gujarat drug connection needs to be exposed and those involved need to be brought to justice. With another seizure of drug consignment at Dwarka in Gujarat on Wednesday, it has been established that drug consignments come to Gujarat via sea route and are distributed in the country,” Malik said.Gujarat minister Kiritsinh Rana said: “The law is equal for everyone and those who have done anything wrong will be punished,” Rana said. Meanwhile, the legal notice sent by Malik’s daughter to Fadnavis reads, “The charge sheet filed by the Narcotics Control Bureau does not support even a single allegation levied by you... But from which source you obtained such false, frivolous and baseless report is better known to you.” It adds: “That my client is demanding damages amounting to ₹5 crore on account of mental torture, agony, financial loss and injury inflicted to his reputation and honour due to the statements which you made in the news telecast, viz. ABP News.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/legal-notices-served-as-malik-fadnavis-continue-to-lock-horns-101636655799820.html
12-11-2021||India||Chennai deluge: Stories of hardship come flooding back||Chennai: For five days, M Mahendran’s life has been hell.The 46-year-old entrepreneur and father of two has not seen the outside of his independent home in Madipakkam, one of Chennai’s worst-inundated localities, since torrential showers began on Sunday.On Monday morning, he let out a shriek when he spotted a snake that lay still on the window of the room where his seven-year old son was attending online classes in – the reptile having floated in on the standing water gathering outside on the road.Three days later, the Mahendran family is marooned in one room of their home, the water level only rising. “There is four feet of water outside our home, and it has entered the living room. I only pray it doesn’t enter the one room we are now in,” said Mahendran over the phone. These rain- battered scenes are not unfamiliar to Chennai, particularly after the devastation of the 2015 floods that killed 400 people, and thus Mahendran has been preparing. “I have the habit of stocking up because I have two sons who are five and seven, and I didn’t want to take a chance. So we have been able to manage for now but I don’t know how many days we will have to remain like this.” Across Chennai on Thursday, Mahendran’s plight was echoed by thousands of citizens. Families either trapped inside their homes because the streets outside are waterlogged, or on higher floors or rooftops because the water entered their homes, carrying only their identity cards and a few spare clothes. Trapped inside, across a metropolitan city where the civic infrastructure is collapsing under pressure, many were even seen using ropes to lower buckets from higher floors to the ground, where volunteers in boats passed on essentials like milk, bread packets, cooked food and water cans. On the streets of the metropolis, inflated rescue boats were as visible as wheeled vehicles, deployed across the city in Madhavaram, Madippakkam, Velachery, T Nagar, Peravallur, Perambur and Pattalam. With many just stranded where they were, unable to step out, only 40 of 160 government shelters set up in the city were occupied on Thursday. In areas like Pattalam in central Chennai, the continued rainfall only added to the sheets of water stagnating for the past four days. This, locals said, had affected not only homes but businesses too. B Rama, who runs a grocery shop said, “We shut shop on Sunday and we haven’t been able to go back. All our rice stock has submerged.” Rama said that there had also been no electricity for the past four days, and therefore for any supplies, people were having to step out, braving the weather. “Women here are walking through chest-deep water,” said B Rama who has a rice shop in Pattalam. Power supply to more than 60,000 houses across the city were suspended as a safety measure in Chennai, electricity minister Senthil Balaji told reporters on Thursday. But this also affected water supply in tanks. Ram Mohan, a resident of Madhavaram in north Chennai, where almost every road is submerged, said, “We have been stuck at home since Sunday and now they have cut off power too. The rain water has mixed with sewage and garbage. So not only are we immobile until the waters recede but we don’t know what infections this would lead to,” he said. And yet, even as parts of Chennai struggled to deal with the crisis, some tried to keep the cheer, albeit with a little government help, and when that wasn’t possible, helped each other. With early November being wedding season, vernacular television news showed visuals of the fire department using a boat to take back a wedding couple and their guests from a submerged marriage hall to their home in T Nagar.In Perambur, families living in a high-rise apartment got together to cook meals for their less fortunate neighbours. “Most of them are slums so they have moved to government shelters,” said a resident Narendra Jain. “We have all stocked up when the rains subsided on Monday and Tuesday and we are safe indoors. So starting today we decided to cook for about poor 500 families who live next to us and are really struggling in four feet deep water.” In Velachery, the lessons from 2015 brought a strange sight on Thursday, with rows of vehicles parked atop a flyover. Velachery, residents said, was low lying, and had seen much damage to life and property six years ago. “The 2015 floods are so fresh in everyone’s minds that nobody wants to take a risk. Most of the cars on the flyover will have a registration starting with the same series because that was the series that came out after the 2015 floods when many of these people lost their cars,” said local resident E Sunalini. Sunalini herself was marooned back in 2015 in Jafferkhanpet where she recalled water was 12-feet high. People then were swimming in these localities to warn their neighbours or pass any information. The following year Sunalini moved to Velachery but has been lucky thus far -- her street has not flooded. “The storm water drains built here recently are making a lot of difference but the surrounding areas are still heavily water logged.” Back in Madipakkam, four kilometers away from Velachery, Mahendran has been desperately trying to find a way out. Outside his window, where the snake once was, civic body workers have been using motor pumps to drain the water. “But even when they do, the water returns in half an hour,” said Mahendran. For now, he is waiting, and praying that the worst is over.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chennai-deluge-stories-of-hardship-come-flooding-back-101636655568175.html
12-11-2021||India||COP26: Two new draft texts on climate finance published||Two new draft texts on setting a new collective quantified climate finance goal and long term finance were published on Thursday, which will be of priority to India and other developing countries. There are many bracketed sections and options which are yet to be agreed upon as on Thursday afternoon.The draft on a new quantified goal for post-2025 suggests setting a new collective finance from a floor of $100 billion per year in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency of implementation and taking into account the needs and priorities of developing countries. Alternately, it suggests parties will define an annual mobilisation goal in the form of an ambitious figure, taking into account the needs and priorities of developing countries as expressed in NDCs. On long term finance, there are two sections that could be of importance to developing countries -- coming up with a multilaterally agreed definition on climate finance, and establishing a measurement and tracking platform to be maintained by the secretariat.“The thing to be careful of here is that most of the points are bracketed and are still being debated. So, these are not final and there is a good chance that these will remain provisional even after COP26,” said Arjun Dutt, Programme Lead at Council on Energy, Environment and Water.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cop26two-new-draft-texts-on-climate-finance-published-101636655559823.html
12-11-2021||India||Tripura violence: SC to hear plea challenging UAPA against journalist, lawyers||The Supreme Court on Thursday agreed to hear a petition of a journalist and two advocates against Tripura Police’s decision to book them under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) for an alleged report on the recent violence in the case. The court, however, is yet to give a date for the hearing. In their petition, the journalist and the advocates alleged that the police move was an attempt to “monopolise the flow of information” by the state. “If the quest for truth and reporting thereof itself is criminalised, then the victim in the process is the idea of justice,” they said. Appearing for the petitioners, advocate Prashant Bhushan said that the two lawyers and the scribe who had gone there on a fact finding mission have been proceeded against by the Tripura Police under the UAPA for their social media posts, and an FIR has been lodged and a notice under the CrPC has been issued to them.“Why did they not go to the high court? You go before the high court,” the bench led by Chief Justice of India N V Ramana observed initially and later agreed to consider listing the plea after the lawyer said that besides seeking relief of quashing of the FIR, the plea also challenged the constitutional validity of some UAPA provisions. Meanwhile, the top court said that no political party should be prevented from campaigning and pursuing its electoral rights in the local body polls. The court made the observations while directing the Tripura government to make all arrangements to maintain law and order for unimpeded right of political participation in the municipal elections. A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud, Surya Kant and Vikram Nath also issued notice to the state government on the plea of Trinamool Congress (TMC) party and its Rajya Sabha MP Sushmita Dev seeking security to its workers and representatives alleging wide scale violence on the party workers during the upcoming local body polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tripura-violence-sc-to-hear-plea-challenging-uapa-against-journalist-lawyers-101636655320462.html
12-11-2021||India||Rescue personnel help Chennai stay afloat||At 7am on Thursday, Tamil Nadu Police inspector E Rajeshwari walked into the TP Chatram police station in Chennai, keenly aware that the day ahead was going to be tough. City roads were already marooned by overnight showers and panicked residents in low-lying areas were calling out for help as water levels rose.The first task for the police team was to remove a large tree that had been felled by strong winds and was blocking a road. “We were working on removing the big tree when I received information about a man who had fallen unconscious in a nearby cemetery,” said Rajeshwari.Within minutes, the 53-year-old woman, along with a constable, was speeding to the spot on a two-wheeler, parting swirling sheets of water. When they reached the spot, they found the man lying unconscious on the ground.“His whole body was freezing. He was curled up on the pavement. But when we tried to move him there was a small gasp of breath,” she said. They called the state ambulance service on the 108 helpline, but couldn’t afford to lose time, and hailed an autorickshaw .Rajeshwari hoisted the 30- year old man on her shoulders, and waded through knee-deep water to place him inside the vehicle with two other people. A video of her heroics went viral on social media and was tweeted even by chief minister MK Stalin.The man was Udhaya, a worker at the crematorium, who received treatment at the government Kilpauk Medical College. “I met his mother and the doctor at the hospital. They said that he is doing okay,” said Rajeshwari.She wasn’t the only one.As torrential rain pounded Chennai and Tamil Nadu districts for the fifth day, throwing normal life out of gear and submerging several neighbourhoods, a phalanx of relief and rescue workers kept the city afloat and kept its civic infrastructure from completely collapsing.On Thursday itself, nearly 18,000 personnel cut through fallen trees and used motor boats to reach people whose houses had been flooded in areas like KK Nagar, T Nagar and Velachery.Sanitation workers braved the downpour to declutter drains, collect waste from households, and remove snapped electricity wires.Rajeshwari showered praise on all her fellow workers.“It’s not just me. All police officers are doing relief work on the ground. It’s just that my video was circulated (on social media). We are mostly engaged in removing fallen trees, providing food and blankets to flood-affected people and moving them to shelters,” she said.Chennai police commissioner Shankar Jiwal praised Rajeshwari for going beyond the call of duty. “At this age, to go around with such enthusiasm inspires the younger generation to not hesitate to do anything to save a life,” Jiwal said.“It is, however, in tune with what our officers have been doing. Flooding isn’t new to Chennai so they know how to act,” Jiwal added.Apart from the police, sanitation workers from the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) worked through the day to clear garbage from drains, collect waste from households, and remove trees often wading through knee deep water, braving potholes, and hanging electricity wires.On Thursday, according to the GCC, water had stagnated in 500 locations across the city out of which they were able to clear 26 as till 2pm.Officials said that they used 46 boats to supply essentials. Authorities used motors and robotic excavators to pump out water, de-clog drains and remove trash. As civic, revenue, public works, police and fire personnel slogged to help people, Stalin said he bowed before all government workers involved in relief and rescue operations. “Your selfless services and sacrifice have removed the distress of crores of people,” he tweeted.GCC officials said they supplied 664,950 food packets to 202,000 people since Sunday, when a depression in the Bay of Bengal triggered a deluge across Tamil Nadu.“Low lying areas are still inundated,” said GCC commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi.“We closed subways as a precaution. We have requested people to avoid stepping outside their homes,” he said.Officials of the revenue and disaster management department said that 100,000 volunteers, including snake catchers, were press into service after reports that snakes had entered many flooded homes. The government also appointed an officer for each of the city’s 15 zones to lead relief operations.Minister for Revenue and Disaster Management KSSR Ramachandran said that 14 NDRF teams are on the ground along with 4 SDRF teams to help with relief work across the state. “Since rains have decreased now, efforts to drain out water is being carried out rapidly,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rescue-personnel-help-chennai-stay-afloat-101636655319229.html
12-11-2021||India||Developing countries dig in heels as talks reach final lap||Talks at the 26th edition of the climate change conference (COP26) in Glasgow entered the crucial final stages of negotiations, with a key grouping of developing countries, which includes India and China, raising objections against some segments of the draft proposal, decrying what they said would amount to “carbon colonialism” by rich nations.Like Minded Developing Countries (LMDC) said the draft document on the outcome of the summit – particularly its focus on the 1.5°C target for all countries -- is reinventing the terms of the 2015 Paris Agreement, which made a differentiation in climate action and ambition.“The Paris Agreement has a delicate balance which we cannot rewrite. There should be differentiation in climate action and ambition. There should also be recognition of the pre-2020 ambition gap. If we go ahead with the proposal of net-zero by 2050 for all countries, the developing world will be trapped. We do not have the technological and financial means to achieve such targets. This narrative will allow the developed world to control the world with carbon colonialism. Developing countries will be ethically and financially condemned for not complying,” said Diego Pacheco, lead negotiator of Bolivia on behalf of LMDC.Pacheco added that 60% of the carbon space was occupied by developed countries with only 18% of the world population, and that the historical responsibility of these regions in causing the climate crisis cannot be ignored.They instead proposed to the COP26 presidency that there be recognition of this historical responsibility and the limited carbon space in the final deal, and that developed countries should achieve full decarbonisation with real and immediate reduction of emissions within this decade. Developed countries are classified as Annex I nations. It also states thatIndia, on behalf of BASIC — a bloc of four countries comprising Brazil, South Africa, India and China — said the draft material lacked balance and while the mitigation section – which deals with steps on reducing emissions offered a highly “prescriptive” approach. The proposals are strong on revising the NDCs, or nationally determined contributions, by 2022, in annual ministerial roundtables and updating long-term strategies, but such an approach is not reflected in judging how climate finance is made available.“The announcements here in Glasgow are encouraging but they are far from enough. The emissions gap remains a devastating threat. The finance and adaptation gap represent a glaring injustice for the developing world. We need even more ambition in the future revised NDCs. We need pledges to be implemented. We need commitments to turn concrete. We need actions to be verified. We need to bridge the deep and real credibility gap,” UN secretary general Antonio Guterres said in a statement on Thursday.“We cannot settle for the lowest common denominator. Keeping the 1.5 goal within reach means reducing emissions globally by 45% by 2030. But the present set of NDCs — even if fully implemented — will still increase emissions by 2030,” he added.According to Third World Network, a non-profit international research and advocacy organisation focusing on North-South affairs, the developed countries were happy with the draft text on mitigation which mentioned the goal of 1.5°C.The US did not want any reference to the principle of Common But Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities with regard to the ‘carbon budget’. UK negotiator Archie Young said: “There is no consensus on many critical issues. Time is running out. We are trying to find solutions,” the representative of the COP26 presidency said. He added that new cover decision and other texts will be released overnight. The US did not respond to requests for a comment on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cop26developing-countries-dig-in-heels-as-talks-reach-final-lap-101636655080090.html
12-11-2021||India||UP sacks Kafeel Khan over Gorakhpur hospital deaths||The Uttar Pradesh government has terminated the services of Dr Kafeel Khan, the paediatrician at Gorakhpur’s Baba Raghav Das (BRD) medical college who was controversially suspended in connection with a shocking oxygen supply-related tragedy in which 63 children died in August 2017.Principal secretary (medical education) Alok Kumar said Dr Khan was dismissed from service on the basis of the inquiry report on the death of the children at BRD Medical College four years ago. The state government sent the inquiry report to the Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission (UPPSC), and the commission ordered the termination of Dr Khan’s services, he added. The dismissal order was issued on Thursday by the medical education department, and Kumar said that departmental action will soon be initiated against Dr Khan.Hours later, Dr Khan described the decision as “illegal”. In a tweet on Thursday afternoon, he said that the 63 children died because the government did not make payments to two oxygen suppliers, and not because of any laxity on his part. “63 kids died ‘cos the govt didn’t pay the O2 suppliers. 8 Doctors,employees got suspended -7 reinstated. inspite of getting clean chit on charges of medical negligence & corruption -I got terminated. Parents-Still awaiting Justice. Justice ? Injustice? U decide,” Dr Khan tweeted.He later posted a video in which he said the “the district magistrate, the principal secretary and the court, in its earlier order, had stated that there was no laxity on my part, nor I have indulged in corruption... Yet, I have been terminated while the main accused in the case are moving scot-free,” he further said. He added that he has “faith in the court and [will] continue to fight for justice”, pointing out that hearings in case are going on in court.Soon after news of Dr Khan’s dismissal broke, Congress general secretary and the party’s Uttar Pradesh in charge Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said the move was inked to the BJP’s “hate agenda” against Muslims.“The dismissal of Dr Kafeel Khan by the UP government is motivated by ill-will. Motivated by hate agenda, the government is doing all this to harass them. The Congress party is with Dr Kafeel in his fight for justice,” she said.“The rule of law is followed in UP. If the government has taken a decision, there must be reasons for it. Don’t jump to conclusions,” state BJP spokesman Harish Srivastava said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-sacks-kafeel-khan-over-gorakhpur-hospital-deaths-101636654780041.html
12-11-2021||India||Punjab House resolution hits out at BSF move||The Punjab Vidhan Sabha on Thursday passed a resolution against the Centre’s notification to extend the jurisdiction of the Border Security Force (BSF) up to 50km inside the international border even as opposition parties questioned the delay by the Congress government in moving the Supreme Court against the order.This was the last assembly session during the tenure of the present Congress government. The resolution was adopted unanimously by the state assembly, “rejecting” the Union home ministry’s October 11 order in the absence of the two members of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is in power at the Centre, from the House. Former chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, who quit the Congress last month and has backed the extension in the BSF’s operational remit, also did not attend the proceedings.All other parties, including the opposition Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), supported the official resolution on the concluding day of the two-day special session convened after an all-party meetting resolved to oppose and reject the Union government’s notification. However, both the AAP and the SAD also questioned the delay in challenging the notification in the apex court.The Centre had amended the BSF Act to authorise the border guarding force to carry out “arrest, search and seizure” within 50km, up from the existing 15km, from the international border in Punjab, West Bengal and Assam.Deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, who holds the home portfolio, moved the resolution demanding the withdrawal of the Centre’s directive.Terming the Centre’s move “an attack on the federal structure”, Randhawa said the state government will challenge the notification in the Punjab and Haryana high court.“As per the Constitution of India, maintaining law and order is the responsibility of the state government, and for this purpose, government of Punjab is fully competent. The decision of extending the jurisdiction of the BSF by the Union government is an expression of distrust towards the police and people of Punjab. This is their insult,” the resolution stated, stressing that prior consultation was needed.Citing a letter written by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2012 to the then United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government as the Gujarat chief minister against a similar move that a separate state was being created within the state, Randhawa suggested that the House members should meet the PM over the issue.As the SAD and AAP members rose to speak on the matter, speaker Rana KP Singh and parliamentary affairs minister Brahm Mohindra said there was no need for a debate as the matter had already been discussed at length in the all-party meeting.The speaker later allowed the members to give their suggestions.Raising the issue of a delay in moving the Supreme Court against the notification, SAD member Bikram Singh Majithia said the Congress government in the state should also take a decision that the Punjab Police would not give cooperation to the BSF beyond 15km.He then hit out at Randhawa for allowing the BSF into the state by asking for their deployment in jails for security. “What purpose will the resolution serve? There have been 16 resolutions so far, but none has been implemented,” he said.While finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal said he (Majithia) was trying to gain a political advantage through the issue, chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi said this was not one person’s fight and they (political parties) were all together in it.Congress member Navjot Singh Sidhu asked why the Akali Dal chief (Sukhbir Singh Badal) did not attend the all-party meeting on such an important issue.Kharar MLA Kanwar Sandhu suggested that the Punjab government should get in touch with other states such as Rajasthan, Gujarat and Jammu & Kashmir and together press for an amendment in the BSF Act to incorporate a clause regarding prior consultation with states before any such changes.SAD (Sanyukt) member Parminder Singh Dhindsa and AAP member Aman Arora asked the CM to share the details of his meeting with the PM and Union home minister Amit Shah after which the Centre issued the BSF notification.“We should have acted promptly after the MHA came out with this directive. It has been one month, but we are still discussing what needs to be done. Why has it (directive) not been challenged in the Supreme Court?” Arora asked.Leader of Opposition Harpal Singh Cheema suggested a resolution against former chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh in the House for repeatedly raising the bogey of security, asking the CM what was his (Channi’s) deal with the Prime Minister and Shah on the BSF issue.Hitting back, Channi said the SAD always saw everything through the narrow prism of politics, especially the issues of utmost importance to Punjab such as devolution of more powers to states, and the transfer of Chandigarh to Punjab.“They allowed entry to the BJP and RSS in Punjab. They became the gateway through which the RSS, which has always been inimical to the interests of Punjab, managed to make inroads in the state. When the RSS and its political wing, the BJP, undermined the federal structure of the country by revoking Article 370 not only did the Akalis side with the BJP but SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal spoke in its favour,” he said.On meeting Modi and Shah, Channi said his meetings with them were a courtesy call. “The Akalis have chosen to forget very conveniently that I wrote letters to the Union government emphasising the reopening of the Kartarpur corridor, besides pleading with it repeatedly to roll back the three draconian agricultural farm laws,” he added, saying that he never asked them to increase the jurisdiction of the BSF in the state.However, the AAP and the SAD members were not satisfied with his reply. They started protesting and entered the well of the House, raising slogans against the state government, before staging symbolic walkouts, separately.The House also passed the Punjab Agricultural Produce Market (Amendment) Bill, 2021, to safeguard the interest of farmers and also annulled a law on contract farming passed by the state assembly in 2013. Earlier in October last year, the assembly passed a resolution against the Centre’s farm laws when Capt Amarinder Singh was the chief minister and also introduced three bills as an attempt to negate the Centre’s farm laws.However, the bills remained stuck with the governor as they were never sent to the President for approval.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-house-resolution-hits-out-at-bsf-move-101636654599142.html

12-11-2021||India||Chennai sinking in the rain||Torrential showers for the second time in five days pounded Chennai and gale force winds forced authorities to bar incoming flights for seven hours on Thursday as thousands of residents scrambled for high ground and rescue personnel waded through knee-deep water to rescue citizens.At least 14 people have died in rain fury across Tamil Nadu since Sunday, when Chennai was battered by 210mm of rainfall, the highest single day rainfall for the month of November since 2015.In the last 24 hours, the city received 203.5mm of rain, inundating many iconic neighbourhoods, residential areas and commercial hubs in the southern city.State minister for revenue and disaster management, KKSSR Ramachandran, said two people died on Thursday in Thanjavur and Thiruvarur.The minister said Tamil Nadu received a total of 405mm of rainfall from October 1 to November 11, an excess of 56%. The other affected districts were Kancheepuram, Chengalpattu, Thiruvallur, Villupuram, Cuddalore and Karaikal.By evening, rain had abated in several parts of Chennai and officials were signalling that the worst was behind them. At 5.30pm, the Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) withdrew the red alert for Chennai as the depression in the Bay of Bengal, which triggered the downpour across southern India, finally made landfall.“It will rain intermittently tonight and isolated places can see very heavy rainfall but it will slowly reduce by tomorrow (Friday),” RMC Chennai chief S Balachandran told reporters.Chennai, a city of 11 million, woke up on Thursday to streets, homes, and hospitals flooded. As water levels rose, nearly 18,000 rescue personnel cut through fallen trees and used motor boats to reach people cut off by swirling sheets of water. T Nagar, KK Nagar, West Mambalam and Velachery were submerged, as were low-lying areas near the coast.Sanitation workers braved the downpour to declutter drains, collect waste from households, and remove snapped electricity wires. Corporation officials said water had stagnated in 523 locations in the city, out of which only 68 could be cleared by the end of day. However, they were able to remove 237 out of the 240 trees that had been uprooted on Thursday.Chief minister MK Stalin hailed the rescue workers and tweeted images of them at work. “Let’s all work together to return to normalcy quickly,” he said.Yet, there was no electricity at some places in the city and residents in some areas complained that little had changed since Sunday, when shock rainfall first inundated the city. “For the last two days, civic workers have been pumping out water stagnated around our apartment but it kept coming back in half an hour. Today it’s not possible to do anything because the water is at least four-feet deep,” said V Narayanasamy, a resident of T Nagar, one of the worst affected areas.People living on ground floor in Ashok Nagar shifted out of their homes. Patients from the flooded ground floor of the government hospital in KK Nagar were moved to other blocks, hospital officials said. In some neighbourhoods, people parked their cars on top of flyovers to prevent them from getting submerged.A resident of north Chennai, Ashok Modi, said they had to survive without power for two days. “Every year, we face the same problems during November and December. We are safe for now but our life is completely paralysed until waters recede,” said Modi.Disaster management minister Ramachandran said Tamil Nadu received a total of 405mm of rainfall from October 1 to November 11, an excess of 56%.“Traditionally low lying areas are still inundated,” said Greater Chennai Corporation commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi. “We closed subways as a precaution. We have requested people to avoid stepping outside their homes.”Transport hubs shutThe Airports Authority suspended flights from the city airport between 11.15am and 6pm, though some departures were allowed. The railways said it was working “overtime” to restore services on the local train network and repairing damage caused to interstate tracks because of strong winds gusting 45 kmph, the RMC said. The Madras high court was forced to work virtually after all roads in the area were submerged.Stalin advised people to remain indoors and said free food would be provided through Amma Canteens till the flood situation improved. He claimed that the situation was under control and said officials were appointed for each ward of the Greater Chennai Municipal Corporation area to monitor the situation.The CM also constituted a panel of six ministers to assess the crop damage in delta districts, which were also pulverised by heavy rain. The National Disaster Relief Force (NDRF) in a statement said 11 teams were deployed in Tamil Nadu, two in Puducherry and five in Andhra Pradesh. “We have set up a around the clock control to monitor the situation,” NDRF said.In all, 10,073 people were moved to 185 relief camps across Tamil Nadu and more than 1,000 hutments damaged. Reservoirs in Chembarambakkam, Redhills, Cholavaram, Poondi and Veeranam had reached their maximum capacity and water was being discharged from the reservoirs.Chennai collectorate announced a holiday for all schools and colleges in the city on Friday. Unlike Sunday, when the sudden deluge caught authorities unawares, officials were better prepared on Thursday with over 400 boats deployed in Chennai itself.Rainfall at this time in Tamil Nadu is not unusual but experts have warned that the climate crisis and unchecked development in low lying areas have exacerbated the problem. The climate crisis has rainfall more intense and frequent and the urbanisation of water bodies has resulted in blocking of discharge outlets, say experts.No lessons learntMoreover, the crisis underlined that only temporary patchwork was done after the 2015 tragedy, and no permanent solutions - removing encroachments on flood plains, stopping the dumping of fly ash, municipal waste and industrial effluents on river basins and unclogging decades-old storm water drains – were undertaken.“Normally Chennai receives an average rainfall of 38-40 cm in November and we have exceeded that already,” said former deputy director of the India Meteorological Department YEA Raj. “We still have 19 days to go so we may see record rainfall or not.”Independent weather expert Pradeep John said that the problem of water-logging was more due to unplanned development and blocking of water discharge systems, especially in the low lying areas close to the coast. “Despite building new drains worth crore of rupees, the problem remains and could continue,” he said.He said this November could break the record for the most rainfall received by the city. According to IMD’s data, the record is held by November 1918 with 1088 mm. “If we take cumulatively, many stations from Wednesday has crossed 200 mm rainfall in 24-hours. Only four times 1000mm has been breached by Chennai’s Nungambakkam in an entire month in 200 years,” said John.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chennai-sinking-in-the-rain-101636654239132.html
12-11-2021||India||Lawsuit over workers’ exploitation filed in US||A lawsuit alleging sub-human working conditions and meagre wages for workers from India at a temple built, maintained and run by a prosperous and well-connected Hindu community has spread to four other US states from the first accusations that were levelled against a New Jersey temple in May. Similar wages of $1.20 an hour were paid to workers at this community’s temples in Chino Hills, a Los Angeles suburb in California; Bartlett, a Chicago suburb in Illinois; Stafford, a Houston suburb in Texas; and Lilburn, an Atlanta suburb in Georgia. The initial lawsuit was filed about the temple in Robbinsville, New Jersey, which is said to be the largest Hindu temple in the United States. The expanded lawsuit was filed in October, as first reported by the New York Times. These temples belong to an organisation called the Bochasanwasi Shri Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha, Inc (BAPS), which is run by members of a Hindu community called the Swaminarayan Sampradaya. The sect has 3,850 centres around the world. They have hosted and co-hosted Diwali celebrations on Capitol Hill, home to the US Congress, that have been attended by a large number of lawmakers, White House officials and Congressional aides. The New Jersey temple was raided by the FBI in a “court-authorized action” under the lawsuit filed in May by six workers by name and 200 in all. The lawsuit says that temple officials’ “actions constitute forced labour, trafficking with respect to forced labour, document servitude, conspiracy, and confiscation of immigration documents in the course of and with the intent to engage in fraud in foreign labour contracting”. The lawsuit brings claims under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (“TVPA”) and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (“RICO”), which has been used by US authorities to bust the American Mafia. The expanded lawsuit filed on October 23, alleges workers at the sect’s temples in California, Illinois, Texas and Georgia “also worked long hours for very little pay, suffering violations of their employment and civil rights”. They were paid the same $1.20 an hour, which was the rate in the US way back in 1963 and is now considerably below the federal and state minimum wages. But working hours and conditions were better — they worked eight hours a day, compared to 12 and a half hours put in by those at the New Jersey temple. They were required to work seven days a week, with one day off a month while New Jersey workers worked seven days a week with just a few days off a year. These workers, who were brought to the US on R-1 visas for those offering religious services, are mostly from marginalised communities in India. The lawsuit alleges the temples “intentionally” employed workers from the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes and temple officials “did what they could to remind these marginalised workers of their place in the social hierarchy”. One official named in the lawsuit is alleged to have called the workers “worms”. The temple organisation told US authorities these workers were coming as religious “volunteers”, the lawsuit said, adding, “In reality, however, the Plaintiffs and other R-1 workers performed solely manual — not religious — labour at the temples” and they were not volunteers. “US government officials have authorized the use of R-1 visas for stone artisans for 20 years, and federal, state and local government agencies have regularly visited and inspected all of the construction projects on which those artisans volunteered,” Paul Fishman, an attorney representing BAPS, said in an email to Associated Press. As at the New Jersey temple, workers at California, Illinois, Texas and Georgia “generally slept in a large hall or other buildings in the respective temple compounds”, the lawsuit states. Security guards were posted at the compounds, and the R-1 workers were not allowed to possess their passports. “For a time when working at the Los Angeles temple, the R-1 workers were required to live in a hotel that was walking distance from the temple, and supervisors escorted them between the Los Angeles temple and the hotel.” As in New Jersey, workers at the four additional locations were prohibited from talking to outside visitors and violation of this rule would be punished with cuts in their payment, which were meagre, to begin with, or being sent back to India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lawsuit-over-workers-exploitation-filed-in-us-101636653700168.html
12-11-2021||India||CBI seeks nod to prosecute retired Allahabad HC judge||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has sought prosecution sanction against Justice Shri Narayan Shukla, now retired, of the Allahabad high court in the judicial corruption scandal involving Prasad Institute of Medical Sciences, where bribes were allegedly paid to secure a favourable order by the institute.Shukla, who retired from the service in July 2020, is accused of taking a bribe for passing an order that favoured the Lucknow-based medical college, which was disbarred from admitting students by the regulator in May 2017.People familiar with the development said prosecution sanction has been sought from the Allahabad high court against Shukla so that a charge sheet can be filed soon. “The investigation has been concluded and there is sufficient evidence in the case,” said a CBI officer, requesting anonymity.The central investigative agency, after registering a First Information Report (FIR), raided Shukla’s residence in December 2019 when he was a sitting judge.He was booked under criminal conspiracy, sections of the prevention of corruption act which deal with accepting bribes, and criminal misconduct along with retired Odisha high court judge IM Quddusi, Bhagwan Prasad Yadav, and Palash Yadav of Prasad Education trust, a conduit, Bhawana Pandey and another alleged middleman Sudhir Giri.HT made efforts to reach out to retired justice SN Shukla for his comments but he could not be contacted.It is alleged that Shukla and Quddusi, who was arrested in September 2017 by CBI, conspired to accept bribes from Prasad Education Trust promising relief in their case related to debarment of their college by the Medical Council of India.Justice Quddusi was given a charge sheet by CBI in July 2019. He is currently out on bail. In September 2017 itself, the central agency launched a subsequent preliminary enquiry (PE) against Shukla.Two months later, former Chief Justice of India, Dipak Misra, ordered an investigation against Shukla on a complaint by Uttar Pradesh advocate general Raghvendra Singh alleging judicial malpractice. A three-member committee comprising then Madras high court chief justice Indira Banerjee, then Sikkim high court chief justice SK Agnihotri and Madhya Pradesh high court judge PK Jaiswal, found Shukla guilty of judicial irregularities in January 2018 after which his impeachment was recommended to the President of India.Shukla, who was a sitting judge at the Lucknow bench of Allahabad HC at the time, was debarred from entering the court premises and all the judicial and administrative work was taken away from him.Later, in July 2019, former CJI Ranjan Gogoi gave permission to CBI to file a case in the matter. Gogoi also wrote to the Prime Minister Narendra Modi recommending Shukla’s removal.CBI has alleged that Prasad Institute of Medical Sciences was debarred in May 2017 by MCI from admitting students for academic years 2017-18 and 2018-19 due to substandard facilities and non-fulfillment of required criteria along with 46 other medical colleges which were also debarred on similar grounds. The decision was challenged by Prasad Institute through a writ petition before the apex court.“Subsequently, a conspiracy was hatched and the writ petition was withdrawn with the permission of the court.“Another writ petition was filed before the Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court on August 24, 2017. It was further alleged that the petition was heard on August 25, 2017 by the division bench of the court comprising Justice SN Shukla and a favourable order was passed on the same day,” CBI’s FIR states.It adds that Quddusi and BP Yadav of Prasad Trust met justice Shri Narayan Shukla on the morning of August 25, 2017, at his residence in Lucknow regarding the matter, which is when the bribe is believed to have been exchanged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-seeks-nod-of-allahabad-high-court-to-prosecute-retired-judge-101636652439844.html

12-11-2021||India||‘Illegal occupation’: India’s first response to China village in disputed region||In its first official response to a US report on China constructing a large village in a disputed region, India said on Thursday it has never accepted such “illegal occupation” of its territory and will takes steps to safeguard country’s sovereignty.The Indian side has stepped up the building of infrastructure, including roads and bridges, in border areas in wake of China’s construction activities in regions it has illegally occupied over the decades, external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi told a regular news briefing.Bagchi was responding to a question on a report submitted on November 3 by the US department of defence to the Congress, which said China had built a large 100-home village in disputed territory between the Tibet Autonomous Region and Arunachal Pradesh. The development was first reported by the Indian media in January.Noting that China has undertaken construction activities in the past several years along border areas, including in areas it has “illegally occupied over the decades”, Bagchi said: “India has neither accepted such illegal occupation of our territory nor has it accepted the unjustified Chinese claims.”The Indian government has stepped up the creation of border infrastructure, including roads and bridges, which has provided much-needed connectivity to the population along the frontier, he said. “Government keeps a constant watch on all developments having a bearing on India’s security and takes all the necessary measures to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity,” he added.The government is committed to the objective of creating infrastructure along border areas to improve the livelihood of citizens, including in Arunachal Pradesh, Bagchi said. At the same time, the government has always conveyed its strong protest to China’s activities through diplomatic means and will continue to do so.The US report on military and security developments involving China had extensively focused on the downturn in India-China relations because of the standoff in Ladakh sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC). Tens of thousands of troops from the two sides have been engaged in a face-off since May 2020, and 20 Indian soldiers and at least four Chinese troops died in a brutal clash at Galwan Valley in June last year.The report said that despite ongoing diplomatic and military dialogues to reduce tensions, China has “continued taking incremental and tactical actions to press its claims at the LAC”.In this context, the report added: “Sometime in 2020, the PRC built a large 100-home civilian village inside disputed territory between the PRC’s Tibet Autonomous Region and India’s Arunachal Pradesh state in the eastern sector of the LAC.”The village and other infrastructure development efforts along the border have been a “source of consternation” for the Indian government, the report said. China has also “attempted to blame India for provoking the standoff through India’s increased infrastructure development near the LAC”, the report added.“Asserting that its deployments to the LAC were in response to Indian provocation, Beijing has refused to withdraw any forces until India’s forces have withdrawn behind the PRC’s version of the LAC and ceased infrastructure improvements in the area,” the report further said.The village referred to in the US report is situated on the banks of Tsari Chu river in Upper Subansiri district of Arunachal Pradesh, a region that has long been contested by India and China.After the report was released, people familiar with the matter in India’s security establishment said the village was within territory controlled by China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/illegal-occupation-india-s-first-response-to-china-village-in-disputed-region-101636638989569.html
12-11-2021||India||Delivering piped 24X7 water supply to top of world||The tiny town of Leh, perched in the northern Himalayas at an elevation of 11,562 feet, bordering China, is unforgiving, despite being a tourist haven of soaring mountains, colourful monasteries and eternal poplars. Much of the Ladakh region, where the town is located, remains snow-bound. Winds are freezing. Even cellphone connections are spotty.Government engineers and contractors have connected 12 of the region’s 60 villages with 24X7 piped water connection in the cold desert under the flagship Jal Jeevan Mission, defying odds that have often left Leh behind in terms of modern infrastructure.The Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) scheme aims to connect every rural household in the country with a functional tap water connection by 2024. Over 120 million households in India lacked access to clean water near their homes, the highest in the world, according to a UN Water report of 2014.India has 189 million rural households, according to Census data, and the race to reach piped water to every household is on. As on November 10, nearly 84.7 million households have been provided with a functioning tapped water supply source. This is 44% of total rural households.The expanding network of piped drinking water is critical for the health of Indians. Poor-quality water is the main cause of diseases such as diarrhoea, the third leading cause of childhood mortality in the country, according to researchers Subitha Lakshminarayanan and Ramakrishnan Jayalakshmy, who work at Puducherry’s Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research and Indira Gandhi Medical College, respectively.Some regions like Leh in the northern Union territory of Ladakh, stood out for their harsh terrain and geographical hurdles in the national programme to provided piped water.Besides, the region witnesses heightened military watch because of a simmering border dispute with China.In one such remote village called Dipling, ferrying men and equipment to locate a sustainable water source and lay the pipeline network was the most arduous task as there was no motorable road.“Air sorties were used to move labour, engineers and equipment to this village,” says Bharat Lal, the additional secretary in the ministry of Jal Shakti, which oversees the programme. Along with high density polyethylene piped, high-tech gadgets to locate water sources were also transported through air.Most villages lacked electricity, without which providing functional piped water supply is impossible. Running motor equipment and monitoring sensors require power. Engineers in Leh built solar power units to solve the problem.Villages along the so-called Line of Actual Control along the India-China border are being covered on a priority.“Solar power units mean the piped water facilities in the region are zero-carbon infrastructure. This makes it totally green,” district magistrate Skrikant Suse said.Of Leh’s 24,767 households, 5,425 households now have tapped water.The Union Budget had allotted ₹10,001 crore in 2019-20 for the national rural drinking water mission. In 2020-21, ₹11500 crore was provided. The Union budget 2021-22 allotted ₹50,000 crore for the mission.Overall, experts say a key challenge for the programme is to maintain sustainability of water supply sources. In previous attempts to provide drinking water supply, villages connected with water sources fell back to “no-water” status after a few years due to non-availability of water.Maintaining sustainability will require work on different aspects altogether. These include groundwater recharge, water conservation and, critically, cutting down the overuse of water in agriculture, which hogs 90% of available supply, mainly because farming isn’t efficient.“India has to bring down its farm-water use to optimal levels for greater sustainability of groundwater, the most important source of water for human consumption,” says Alok Nath, a former water specialist at the Indian Council for Agricultural Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/12-ladakh-villages-will-now-get-24x7-piped-water-as-part-of-centre-s-jal-jeevan-mission-101636636406428.html

He added they were unanimous in calling for a chief ministerial candidate from the “historically wronged” group.“Goa was liberated 60 years ago (from the Portuguese). During this time, there have been chief ministers from various communities -- Brahmin, Marathi Gomantak Samaj, Catholic. But, from the Bhandari Samaj, there was only one chief minister -- Ravi Naik for two-and-a-half years,” Sisodia said. He added that, among the OBCs, the Bhandari community are a majority. “.... in Goa’s population, over 30% are from the Bhandari community, and they have contributed greatly towards the state.” He added that the community has never got its rightful place in Goa’s politics.Sisodia said there was a lot of anger and disappointment within the community, and that is why the AAP has decided to have its chief ministerial face from it.While the Bhandari Samaj did not directly welcome the move, association president, Ashok Naik, said they would support any party that gave maximum seats to members of the community. Others within the community, however, decried the move and accused the president of selling out to the AAP.“There is no unanimity among the community over whom to support... Even the community’s leaders are spread across political parties...,” Anil Hoble, a former president and presently a vice-president of the BJP, said. Edwin Fonseca, a former president of Catholic Association of Goa, said: “It’s not as if Goa belongs to one community or another who should be preferred for political reasons. There could be many unintended consequences of such a move.” Political analyst Cleofato Almeida Coutinho said: “They could have announced the CM face without specifying his caste and community.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aaps-cm-candidate-in-goa-will-be-from-bhandari-community-says-manish-sisodia-101636632026327.html
12-11-2021||India||Congress seeks privilege motion against minister||The Congress has sought to move a privilege motion over Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Tarun Vijay’s appointment as the National Monuments Authority (NMA) chairman, saying the appointee does not meet the criteria laid down under a law passed by the Parliament for the post.Congress’s chief whip in Rajya Sabha Jairam Ramesh wrote a letter on Thursday to Venkaiah Naidu, the chairman of Parliament’s Upper House on the privilege motion. He pointed out that Vijay, a former editor of the weekly Panchajanya of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the BJP’s ideological fountainhead, is ineligible for the post. Ramesh said the appointment makes a mockery of the law.Ramesh cited the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (Amendment and Validation) Act’s Section 20F and said that it stipulates that the chairman to be appointed should have proven experience and expertise in archaeology, town planning, architecture, heritage, conservation architecture, or the law. “For the first time, I find that the government of India has appointed a chairperson whose education and professional background does not, in any way whatsoever, meet the requirement of the law as stipulated mandatorily by Parliament,” Ramesh said in the letter, a copy of which HT has seen. Since Ramesh is seeking to move the privilege motion now, it has to be against the current minister. The Congress maintained the details of his appointment came into light later. Culture minister’s office didn’t wish to comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-eyes-privilege-motion-over-bjp-ex-mp-vijay-s-appointment-as-nma-chief-101636615164813.html
