23-11-2021||Editorials||When riparian nations join hands||A two-day meet on the Ganga-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) river basins — jointly organised by the World Meteorological Organisation, ministry of earth sciences and India Meteorological Department — began in New Delhi on Monday. Hydrological experts from India’s Central Water Commission and scientists from Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan and China (a part of the GBM river basin system) are attending the meeting. One of the key aims is developing a hydrological SOS system — one that will share data on reservoirs, rivers, and dam waters round the year — to help mitigate floods, droughts, mudslides, and accelerated erosion. This is important because the areas that fall under the GBM system are flood-prone. Its fragile ecology, varied terrain, and socio-economic-political situation add to the natural challenges.
