South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Lesotho are some of the nations from where passengers’ entry have either been banned or require the mandatory undergoing of additional measures.On Saturday, Japan announced the addition of three more nations – Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia, to its list of countries where travel curbs have been imposed. The restriction has already been announced for people arriving from Botswana, South Africa, Lesotho, Namibia, Eswatini, and Zimbabwe.The WHO has termed the B.1.1.529 variant of Covid-19 as a ‘variant of concern’. The United Nations (UN) health agency’s southeast Asia director Poonam Khetrapal Singh on Saturday urged southeast Asian countries not to lose their guards, and boost surveillance and enhance vaccination in order to combat the new coronavirus variant.Meanwhile, the United Kingdom (UK) on Saturday confirmed its first two cases of omicron Covid-19 variant. The country’s health secretary Sajid Javid said in a statement as reported by AFP that they have moved “rapidly” and the patients are currently self-isolating while contact tracing is underway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-africa-health-minister-says-travel-ban-over-omicron-is-unjustified-101638027768132.html

Reports of the new variant have triggered panic and brought back fresh restrictions across the world. The variant is heavily mutated and is thought to be more transmissible than the previous variants.Here are five things that the White House chief medical advisor said about the Omicron in an interview with CNN. Fauci was asked about the concerns regarding Omcron and whether there is any chance that it has already spread to the United States. 1. There are concerns over more transmissibility and the possibility of the evasion of the immune response. We do not know for sure right now. This is really something in motion.Shouldn’t let guards down’: WHO tells southeast Asian countries over omicron2. The variant seems to be spreading at a reasonably rapid rate in the sense of when they do test positivity, it seems to be a bit more widespread than what was previously thought. It is in a fluid motion.3. Anything is possible. There is no indication that the new variant is present in the United States. There is a lot of travel involved in how the variant spread from South Africa to Hong Kong. And so, we are trying to get the actual molecular make-up of the variant so that we can test for it. And that's something that will take time.WHO avoids Greek alphabet Xi and names new Covid variant Omicron. Here's why4. When you look at a mutation, it is going to give you a hint or prediction that it might evade the immune response. You need to get that particular sequence of the virus, put it in a form in the lab where you can actually test the different antibodies so you can have a prediction that it might evade or you can actually prove it. Right now, we are getting the material together.5. You are talking about sort of like a red flag that it might be an issue but we don't know. Once we test, you can tell for sure whether it does or does not evade the antibodies that we make for example against the virus through a vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-5-things-dr-fauci-says-about-this-new-variant-of-covid19-101638024418061.html

The announcement was made by Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Saturday, who told reporters that his government wants to ensure “border control measures” are strictly in place, according to Nikkei Asia.In the latest additions, travellers from Mozambique, Malawi and Zambia will have to undergo mandatory quarantine at a government-designated accommodation for 10 days. The country has already imposed tighter entry norms for individuals arriving from Botswana, South Africa, Lesotho, Namibia, Eswatini, and Zimbabwe. Passengers from these nations will also have to take Covid-19 tests on their third, sixth and 10th day of mandatory quarantine.This comes after the World Health Organization (WHO) on Saturday urged Southeast Asian countries not to let their “guards down” and increase surveillance, boost health and social measures, and intensify vaccination coverage as the world grapples to combat the omicron Covid-19 variant.In a statement, WHO Southeast Asia director Poonam Khetrapal Singh said that countries in the region must gauge the risk of import of omicron variant via international travel and adopt measures accordingly to tackle it.“The more Covid-19 circulates, the more opportunities the virus will have to change and mutate, and the pandemic will last longer,” she added in the statement.Also Read | Omicron Covid variant: What do we know about risks, symptoms, testsShe stated that till now 31 per cent of the southeast Asian region’s population is fully vaccinated against coronavirus, while 21 per cent has been partially jabbed. “Nearly 48 per cent of about a billion people are yet to receive even a single dose of the Covid-19 vaccine,” Singh noted.Japan is among a host of nations, which have imposed travel restrictions or bans on travellers from African nations owing to fear over the omicron Covid-19 variant. The B.1.1.529 variant has been listed by the WHO under its ‘variant of concern’ category, causing paranoia in the global sphere. Although the global health agency said that studies are still being done on the new Covid-19 variant to understand it, scientists have pointed out that it can undergo nearly 30 mutations in the coronavirus protein that determines its transmissibility among people.As far as India is concerned, Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired a high-level review meeting on Saturday where discussions pertaining to the country’s Covid-19 situation amid the omicron threat were held for two hours. Multiple states, including Maharashtra, Uttarakhand and Delhi, among others, have announced flight bans, mandatory RT-PCR tests and vaccination proof for travellers coming from ‘at-risk’ countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-omicron-scare-japan-imposes-travel-curbs-on-3-more-countries-reports-101638021226631.html

Experts explain“Using this approach, this variant has been detected at faster rates than previous surges in infection, suggesting that this variant may have a growth advantage.”What can countries and individuals do?The WHO said that countries can enhance surveillance and sequencing efforts to better understand circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants. They can submit complete genome sequences and associated metadata to a publicly available database, such as GISAID.They can also report initial cases or clusters associated with the Variant of Concern (VOC) infection to the WHO through the IHR mechanism.Also read | Omicron: Everything about new coronavirus variant, 'most concerning' since deltaCountries can also perform field investigations and laboratory assessments to improve understanding of the potential impacts of the VOC on Covid-19 “epidemiology, severity, the effectiveness of public health and social measures, diagnostic methods, immune responses, antibody neutralization, or other relevant characteristics.”People should continue to follow measures to reduce their risk of Covid-19, including wearing well-fitting masks, following hand hygiene and physical distancing, improving ventilation of indoor spaces, avoiding crowded spaces, and getting vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-covid-variant-what-do-we-know-about-risks-symptoms-tests-101637993949320.html

No cases related to this variant have been detected in Canada as yet.These measures come as Canada experiences an increase in new infections, tracking the progress of the pandemic in Europe. The period between November 18 and 25 marked an increase of 9% in average daily cases, as 2,608. Canada recorded 3,055 new infections on Friday, taking the total to 1,782,171 including 29,618 deaths.The countries that will be impacted by the ban on travel are South Africa, Eswatini, Lesotho, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, and Namibia. “Foreign nationals who have travelled in any of these countries within the previous 14 days will not be permitted entry into Canada,” a statement from the country’s health ministry said.“These new measures are being put in place out of an abundance of caution,” minister of health Jean-Yves Duclos said.Canadian citizens and permanent residents will be allowed to return to the country but will face a stringent testing and quarantine regimen.All travellers arriving by air will be required to remain in a designated quarantine facility while they await results of a test conducted upon them on arrival at a Canadian airport. They will have to undergo a 14-day quarantine regardless of vaccination status and will retake the test on the eighth day after they reach Canada. As there are no direct flights between these southern African nations and Canada, travellers will have to have a negative result of a molecular test done within 72 hours at the last point of departure, the third country, before they are allowed to board an airplane bound for Canada.In a statement, Canada’s chief public health officer Dr Theresa Tam said that “due to the potential for increased transmissibility, and the possibility of increased resistance to vaccine-induced protection, we are concerned about this new variant and closely monitoring the evolving situation”.She added that nationally, “the daily case counts have been slowly creeping up so we need to maintain a high degree of caution to avoid a rapid acceleration”.These developments come as Canadian health authorities started administering doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech paediatric vaccine to children aged between five and 11.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-variant-canada-bans-entry-from-6-southern-african-nations-101637993874795.html

EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen asserted that flights will have to “be suspended until we have a clear understanding about the danger posed by this new variant, and travelers returning from this region should respect strict quarantine rules.”Saudi ArabiaSaudi Arabia also suspended flights to and from South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Lesotho and Eswatini over concerns related to the new coronavirus variant, the state news agency (SPA) reported on Friday.Japan, RussiaThe Japanese government imposed quarantine rules for Japanese nationals arriving from Eswatini, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, South Africa and Lesotho. Such travellers will have to be isolated at government-dedicated accommodations for 10 days and take three COVID-19 tests during that time. Russia also announced travel restrictions effective Sunday.AustraliaAustralia is the latest to ban flights from nine southern African countries on Saturday, tightening its borders again to prevent the entry of the Omicron variant. Non-Australians who visited South Africa, Zimbabwe and several other nations in the past fortnight will also be barred from Australia, Health Minister Greg Hunt announced today. Meanwhile, Australian citizens will have to undergo a supervised 14-day quarantine.IndiaOn the other hand, India has not imposed any travel ban for flights from the affected region.

The order takes effect on December 3 and will be re-assessed based on the latest data on January 15.“We continue to see warning signs of spikes this upcoming winter, and while the new omicron variant has yet to be detected in New York state, it’s coming,” Hochul said. Earlier in the month, Hochul blamed vaccine holdouts for a rise in hospitalizations, saying that a worsening situation was avoidable if people would get the shots. She also discouraged large indoor gatherings for Thanksgiving, saying then that “we are heading into a vulnerable time.”President Joe Biden on Friday imposed fresh travel restrictions on nations in southern Africa, where the omicron variant was first detected, joining efforts by other countries to try and slow the spread of a potentially potent new Covid-19 variant.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said late Friday that no omicron cases have been identified so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-new-york-declares-state-of-emergency-amid-threat-of-new-coronavirus-variant-101637986871209.html

The variant, first discovered in Botswana in southern Africa, is believed to be spreading faster than the delta variant - the world-dominant strain.Also Read | All you need to know about the omicron variantHowever, the scientists are saying that more studies are needed to understand if the omicron (or B.1.1.529) - categorised as 'variant of concern' by the World Health Organization (WHO) - is indeed leading to more hospitalisations and fatalities.Dubbed as 'super strain' by healthcare experts, omicron has more than 30 mutations - more than any other variants and twice as many as delta.What are the concerns around the omicron variant?According to preliminary studies conducted on the new variant, it makes vaccines 40 per cent less effective. This is due to 32 mutations in the spike protein.According to health experts based in the UK, cited by Daily Mail, two of these mutations - R203K and G204R - help the virus replicate faster. Three of these mutations - H655Y, N679K and P681H - help it to sneak into the into the body's cells more easily, they said. The presence of last two mutations together, a rare occurrence, also indicate omicron is more resistant to vaccines.The experts also said that omicron is missing a membrane protein (NSP6) - seen in earlier iterations of the virus - which could make it more infectious.However, scientists has said that more studies are needed before concrete results are established about the omicron variant and its behaviour.Where did omicron originate?The variant originated in southern part of Africa earlier this month, according to WHO, and brought on a fresh surge of infections.Omicron has now been seen in travellers to Belgium, Hong Kong and Israel as well as in southern Africa.The global responseA number of countries, including the United States, have imposed a travel ban on African countries due to emergence of omicron, which has led to 320% surge in infection in the continent.These countries are: South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, the Seychelles, Malawi and Mozambique.Where has the omicron variant spread?Two confirmed cases have been reported in Hong Kong, and one each in Israel and Belgium. Three others are suspected be carrying the strain in Israel.In case of Hong Kong, a man contracted the strain in South Africa and another one who was staying in another room also got it from him. Israel's confirmed case is a man, who recently travelled to Malawi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-why-is-the-new-coronavirus-variant-is-so-deadly-experts-explain-101637984320174.html

The conference will be convened as soon as conditions allow, General Council Chair Dacio Castillo said in a statement.“My priority is the health and safety of all MC12 participants -- ministers, delegates and civil society,” Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said. “It is better to err on the side of caution.”The Swiss government announced a ban on all direct flights from southern Africa after the World Health Organization said new, potentially riskier strain named omicron is a variant of concern. Beginning Friday all people entering Switzerland from southern Africa, Hong Kong, Israel and Belgium must present a negative Covid-19 test and go into quarantine for 10 days, according to a statement from the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health. Countries across Europe halted air travel from southern Africa amid growing concern about the variant. European Union members agreed to rapidly impose restrictions on seven African countries -- Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe -- as scientists scrambled to determine whether the new strain is more dangerous.The sudden change may prevent trade ministers from reaching agreements on critical issues relating to a waiver of the WTO’s intellectual-property rules for vaccines and therapeutics. Approximately 4,000 trade officials were planning to travel to Geneva for the WTO’s 12th ministerial conference, a gathering of the organization’s highest decision-making body.The meeting, which was scheduled to take place from Nov. 30 to Dec. 3, presented a rare opportunity for governments to deliver real outcomes that impact the lives of everyday people.WTO ministerial meetings typically take place every two years but there has not been a ministerial conference since 2017 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/better-to-err-on-side-of-caution-wto-postpones-in-person-ministerial-conference-over-omicron-outbreak-101637979425416.html

The global health body suggested omicron could pose greater risks than delta.The Technical Advisory Group on SARS-CoV-2 Virus Evolution met today to review what is known about the #COVID19 variant B.1.1.529.They advised WHO that it should be designated a Variant of Concern.WHO has named it Omicron, in line with naming protocols https://t.co/bSbVas9yds pic.twitter.com/Gev1zIt1EkHere is everything you need to know about the new omicron variant of coronavirus:Where did omicron originate?The variant is believed to have originated in southern part of Africa (officially declared by WHO on November 24) and brought on a fresh surge of infections. The WHO said that the first known confirmed B.1.1.529 infection was from a specimen collected on November 9.Omicron has now been seen in travellers to Belgium, Hong Kong and Israel as well as in southern Africa.What makes it dangerous?Early evidence suggests an increased risk of reinfection compared with other highly transmissible variants, according to the WHO. That means people who contracted Covid-19 and recovered could be subject to catching it again.Also Read | Omicron variant poses 'high to very high' risk to Europe: EU health agency"We must move quickly and at the earliest possible moment," British Health Secretary Sajid Javid told lawmakers on Friday.What is known about the variant?The researchers spotted the B.1.1.529 in a sample taken from Botswana in Africa. They were surprised to find that it contained more than 30 changes (mutations) to the spike protein.However, the scientists are still studying the variant and its effects further to identify if it causes more severe disease. As with other variants, some infected people display no symptoms, the doctors in South Africa said.Medical experts, including the WHO, warned against any overreaction before the variant was better understood.Dr Anthony Fauci, the US government's top infectious disease expert, said though the omicron variant is thought to be more transmissible and resistant to vaccines than other variants, "we don't know that for sure right now".The global panicThe 27-nation European Union suspended air travel from southern Africa.

27-11-2021||World||Countries restrict travel from southern Africa as ‘Omicron' sparks concern||The United States, Canada, Saudi Arabia and Cyprus became the latest countries Friday to restrict travel from southern Africa, where a new Covid strain labelled a "variant of concern" was discovered.The World Health Organization said the new variant is more infectious than the dominant, highly transmissible Delta strain, and renamed this B.1.1.529 strain of Covid-19 as Omicron.It has reached Europe with one confirmed case in Belgium after being found in South Africa, Botswana and then in Hong Kong.Anxious tourists in Johannesburg rushed to the airport to catch a last flight out as nations across the globe started shutting their doors, while many worried the new variant could be more resistant to vaccines.Markets plunged as news sank in that the new variant could potentially deal a heavy blow to the global recovery.US President Joe Biden said countries should donate more Covid-19 vaccines and give up intellectual property protections to manufacture more doses worldwide to stem the spread of the virus."The news about this new variant should make clearer than ever why this pandemic will not end until we have global vaccinations," he said.Scientists are now racing to determine the threat posed by the heavily mutated strain, and whether the current coronavirus vaccines should be adjusted.The WHO said earlier it could take several weeks to understand the variant and cautioned against imposing travel curbs while scientific evidence was still scant.EU officials holding an emergency meeting agreed to urge all 27 nations in the bloc to restrict travel from southern Africa, even though many members had already announced flight suspensions.'Draconian' travel bans Europe is already struggling with a coronavirus surge, and the Netherlands on Friday became the latest country to ramp up anti-Covid restrictions with the early closure of bars, restaurants and shops."From Sunday, the whole of the Netherlands is effectively closed between 5pm and 5am," Prime Minister Mark Rutte said.Belgium announced the first publicly known case of B.1.1.529 in Europe: an unvaccinated person who returned on November 11 from Egypt via Turkey. The health ministry did not give the individual's nationality, age or gender."It must be repeated that this is a suspect variant -- we don't know if it is a very dangerous variant," Belgian Health Minister Frank Vandenbroucke said.Israel said it has quarantined three people, one having just returned from Malawi.Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, Cyprus and the Netherlands joined Britain Friday in suspending flights from southern Africa.The United States and Canada also restricted travel from the region. The US measures go into force on Monday.Japan said it will require a 10-day quarantine period for travelers from the area.The shock measures included South Africa, as well as many of the following: Botswana, Eswatini (Swaziland), Lesotho, Namibia, Zambia, Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe.South Africa's health ministry called the global rush to impose travel bans "draconian."Germany on Friday used a military plane to transfer intensive-care patients to less afflicted regions, in an unprecedented move as it battles a vicious fourth wave of the pandemic."The last thing we need now is an introduced new variant," Germany's acting health minister Jens Spahn said.The Philippines also suspended flights from southern Africa, while Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan and Morocco announced bans, as well.'Ridiculous'The rush to close off southern Africa comes a day after scientists in Johannesburg said they had detected the new strain with at least 10 mutations, compared with two for the Delta.The variant is of "serious concern" and had been blamed for a surge in infection numbers, authorities in South Africa said.Spooked European markets fell at close by three percent, with airline shares especially hit. Tokyo closed down 2.53 percent.The new variant caused Wall Street to plunge in Friday's holiday shortened session, with the Dow Jones index suffering its worst loss of the year as it plunged 2.5 percent.And next week's World Trade Organization ministerial conference, the global trade body's biggest gathering in four years, was called off at the last minute Friday due to the new variant, a source told AFP.The European Medicines Agency said it was "premature" to talk about modifying current vaccines to target the new variant.Germany's BioNTech and US drugmaker Pfizer said they were studying the variant, with impact data expected "in two weeks at the latest" to say whether their jointly developed vaccine should be adjusted if Omicron spreads globally.Moderna said it will develop a booster specific to the new variant as part of a three-pronged strategy to fight it."It's ridiculous, we will always be having new variants," one disappointed traveler in South Africa said.Tour operators deplored the quick end to the tourist season with safaris and beach holidays canceled by the thousands."This is a knee-jerk reaction but with such a strong snowball effect," said tour organizer Richard de la Rey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/countries-restrict-travel-from-southern-africa-as-omicron-sparks-concern-101637966762009.html
27-11-2021||World||Omicron variant poses 'high to very high' risk to Europe: EU health agency||The new Covid variant, dubbed Omicron and originally detected in South Africa, poses a "high to very high" risk to Europe, the EU health agency warned on Friday.The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) noted in a threat assessment report that there was still "considerable uncertainty related to the transmissibility, vaccine effectiveness, risk for reinfections and other properties of the Omicron variant."However, the overall risk that Omicron posed to the European Union and European Economic Area (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) was "high to very high."Given the possibility that current vaccines may not protect against the variant, and the fact that it may be more transmissible, "we assess the probability of further introduction and community spread in the EU/EEA as high," the Stockholm-based agency said."In a situation where the Delta variant is resurgent in the EU/EEA, the impact of the introduction and possible further spread of Omicron could be very high," it added.Apart from South Africa, Omicron has been detected in Israel in a person coming from Malawi as well as in Botswana, Hong Kong and EU member Belgium.The agency urged countries to conduct genomic sequencing and contact tracing of confirmed cases, and called for people to not travel to affected areas.The World Health Organization on Friday declared the recently-discovered strain to be a variant of concern.The classification puts Omicron into the most-troubling category of Covid-19 variants, along with the globally-dominant Delta, plus its weaker rivals Alpha, Beta and Gamma.Nations rushed to ban flights to slow the spread of Omicron on Friday, while stock markets and oil prices plunged on fears surrounding the variant, potentially dealing a heavy blow to the global economic recovery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-variant-poses-high-to-very-high-risk-to-europe-eu-health-agency-101637966536511.html
27-11-2021||World||Don’t panic, wait and watch: WHO on ‘Omicron’ variant||The World Health Organization (WHO) on Friday classified the new coronavirus variant detected in South Africa as a “variant of concern”, naming it Omicron. The announcement came late on Friday after a closed-door meeting of experts from WHO gathered to assess the variant.Also Read | Omicron: Everything about new coronavirus variant, 'most concerning' since deltaEarlier in the day, WHO had urged countries not to panic and cautioned against “hasty measures”, even as a slew of nations across the world reacted with alarm to the news.Several nations, particularly those in Europe, started banning flights from South Africa and neighbouring nations.A day earlier in India, the Union health ministry had directed states to start rigorous screening and testing of all international travellers coming from or transiting through Botswana, South Africa and Hong Kong – the countries that had till then reported cases of the new variant. As of late Friday night, infections outside of Africa were confirmed in at least three nations – Hong Kong, Israel and Belgium.Global scientists are still trying to determine whether the new variant — also known as the B.1.1.529 — is more transmissible or more lethal than previous ones, but it does have the most mutations of any strain yet identified.Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser to the UK Health Security Agency, told BBC radio the variant has about 30 mutations “that seem relevant” – double the number seen in the highly-transmissible Delta variant.This has raised concerns across the world, with authorities fearing a wave of infections much worse than what was witnessed during the dreaded Delta wave outbreaks.New cases in South Africa, where it was first discovered, have grown more than 320% in the past week.Of particular concern is the situation in Guateng province, where test positivity in a particular region jumped from 1% to over 30% in just three weeks. Sequencing there showed almost all recent samples are of B.1.1.529, out-competing Delta in a way never seen before anywhere in the world.German biotech company BioNTech, which has developed one of the most widely used Covid-19 vaccines with Pfizer, has begun studying the new variant and expects the first data from laboratory tests about how it interacts with its vaccine within two weeks.The WHO said it would take weeks to determine how effective vaccines were against the new variant, but the news nevertheless pummelled global stocks amid fears what new bans would do to the global travel industry and already shaky economies. Markets slid heavily across Asia, Europe and then finally in the US where early trading led to a post-Thanksgiving selloff.In Geneva, the WHO – whose experts gathered on Friday to discuss the variant – cautioned countries not to jump to conclusions and warned against “knee-jerk” travel curbs.“At this point, implementing travel measures is being cautioned against,” WHO spokesperson Christian Lindmeier said. “The WHO recommends that countries continue to apply a risk-based and scientific approach when implementing (curbs).”The Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention agreed and it “strongly discourages the imposition of travel ban for people originating from countries that have reported this variant,” it said in a statement. It added that “over the duration of this pandemic, we have observed that imposing bans on travellers from countries where a new variant is reported has not yielded a meaningful outcome.”All those urgings, however, fell on deaf ears.Early in the day, European Commission president Ursula Von der Leyen proposed to activate an emergency ban for air travel from southern Africa until there’s a clearer understanding of the potential dangers.Minutes later, the UK became the first European country to ban flights from South Africa and five other southern African countries effective noon on Friday.Soon enough, travel bans being enacted by countries across Europe and beyond.Germany said its flight ban could be enacted on Friday night. Spain said airlines coming back from South Africa will only be able to transport citizens home, and travellers will need to go into quarantine for 14 days whether or not they are vaccinated.France suspended all flights arriving from the southern African region for 48 hours. Italy also banned entry of anyone who has been in these southern nations in the past 14 days. The Netherlands and the Czech Republic are planning similar measures.Belgium’s government announced the first publicly known case of B.1.1.529 in Europe: an unvaccinated person who returned on November 11 from Egypt via Turkey.By late Friday night, travel bans of varying degrees had been announced by countries like Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Greece, Morocco, among others.In Washington, top US infectious disease official Anthony Fauci said no decision had been made on a possible travel ban to the United States. There was no indication that the variant was in the US, and it was unclear whether it was resistant to current vaccines, he told CNN.Israel imposed a travel ban covering most of Africa as Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said a few cases of the new strain had been reported there.Local news reported that, according to the health ministry, one of those individuals had received a third shot, or booster, of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine two months ago.“We are currently on the verge of a state of emergency,” Bennett said.The latest threat in a nearly two-year-long battle against Sars-CoV-2 comes just as the latest wave of infections spirals out of control in countries from Germany to Belgium to Austria. Some parts of Europe are already back in lockdown due to a massive spike in cases in recent weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dont-panic-wait-and-watch-who-on-omicron-variant-101637966201335.html

Many Mexicans go on religious pilgrimages as December 12, the day of the Virgin of Guadalupe, approaches.Because they often walk or bike on narrow roads or travel in aging buses, accidents are not uncommon.Mexico State borders Mexico City on three sides, and includes both remote rural villages and crowded suburbs of the capital.Chalma was a site sacred in pre-Hispanic times before the 1521 conquest. After the Spanish came, believers say, a cross miraculously appeared in a cave that had been dedicated to an Aztec god, making Chalma a Christian pilgrimage site.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/19-dead-32-injured-in-mexico-pilgrimage-bus-crash-101637965393731.html

Most non-US citizens who have been in those countries within the prior 14 days will not be allowed into the United States."As a precautionary measure until we have more information, I am ordering additional air travel restrictions from South Africa and seven other countries," Biden said in a statement. "These new restrictions will take effect on November 29. As we move forward, we will continue to be guided by what the science and my medical team advises."Another administration official warned that the United States could add countries to the restriction list if the variant spreads.Delta Air Lines and United Airlines both fly to South Africa and United is set to resume nonstop flights from Newark to Cape Town on Dec. 1. Shares of both airlines closed down more than 8% Friday.Biden on Friday called on nations meeting at the World Trade Organization next week to agree to waive intellectual property protections for COVID-19 vaccines in the wake of the discovery of the new variant."The news about this new variant should make clearer than ever why this pandemic will not end until we have global vaccinations," Biden said in a statement.Some public health experts have said the United States has not done enough to provide vaccines overseas, particularly as it pushed forward with booster shots for its own citizens.Earlier, top US infectious disease official Dr. Anthony Fauci said the United States was rushing to gather data on the new Covid-19 variant.It could take weeks for scientists to fully understand the variant's mutations. Health authorities are seeking to determine if omicron is more transmissible or infectious than other variants and if vaccines are effective against it.The United States only lifted travel restrictions on South Africa on Nov. 8.One administration official said the restrictions are expected to take effect at 12:01 a.m. EST Monday and came after a high-level administration meeting Friday afternoon to discuss the issue.The Biden administration was holding a briefing with US airlines to discuss the restrictions on Friday.In January, Biden imposed a ban on most non-US citizens entering the country who had recently been in South Africa.The United States only lifted the travel curbs on 33 countries including South Africa, China, much of Europe, India, Brazil, Ireland, Britain and Iran on Nov. 8 after blocking the entry of most foreign nationals who had recently been in those countries since beginning in early 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-covid-variant-us-to-curb-travel-from-8-southern-african-countries-101637958589933.html

In October, its data showed a roughly 50% efficacy, based on data from 775 patients.Merck released the data before the US Food and Drug Administration published a set of documents on Friday intended to brief a panel of outside experts who will meet on Tuesday to discuss whether to recommend authorising the pill.England’s R number rises, likely above 1England’s Covid weekly reproduction “R” number has risen and is likely to be above one, with latest estimates showing it between 1.0 and 1.1, the UK Health Security Agency said on Friday.

He will instead focus on talks with European Union ministers, Macron told reporters during a visit to Rome. The French president also criticised Johnson for posting on Twitter a letter he wrote demanding France takes the migrants back.“I am surprised by methods when they are not serious; a leader doesn’t communicate with another by tweets or letter that is made public,” Macron said. France will see about working with the British “if they decide to be serious,” he added.The UK and France have been at loggerheads on issues from defence to trade since Britain’s divorce from the EU. There are personal tensions, too, between Johnson and Macron, evident in the fallout over Australia’s decision in September to ditch a French submarine contract in favour of an agreement with the US and the UK.In another dispute that also derives from the intensifying animosity between the two countries, French fishermen blocked access to ports in northern France to try to heap pressure on the UK over post-Brexit fishing licenses. They also jammed the ramp leading to the Eurotunnel freight terminal between Britain and France near Calais from 2pm - 4pm Police officers said there were no tensions, no violence. At the British end, traffic was flowing freely into the terminal with no reported delays.“This is a warning shot,” Gerard Romiti, head of France’s leading fishing union, said by phone. “I wish we weren’t forced to do this but we are. We need to stand by our fishermen.”Philippe Fait, the mayor of Etaples-sur-mer, a fishing town of 12,000 inhabitants, was among the protesters at the freight terminal. He said there’s been an impact on his community since some haven’t received licenses to fish.“We want the Brexit accord to be delivered” by the year’s end, Fait said, calling Brussels to flex its muscles.The broader rift between the UK and France has hampered efforts to agree a joint approach to tackling the small boats crisis in the Channel. After at least 27 died when their boat capsized on Wednesday, Johnson criticized France for not doing enough to prevent people from making the crossings.France has already repeatedly rejected the idea of joint patrols on sovereignty grounds. The idea of a returns agreement is also politically sensitive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/get-serious-angry-macron-tells-uk-over-migrant-crisis-101637957876076.html

Ajmal Kasab was the only terrorist who was captured alive. He was hanged four years later on November 21, 2012.India and several other countries, including the US, the UK and France, have repeatedly asked Pakistan to bring the perpetrators of the 26/11 attacks to justice, but no such firm initiative has been taken yet by Islamabad.The US tried and punished David Headley, a Pakistan-American, who had visited India to scout the targets hit by the attackers.

It has six docking ports and will allow potential future expansion of the Russian segment of the station.The module has moored to the docking port of the new Russian Nauka (Science) laboratory module.On Wednesday, a Soyuz rocket took off from the Russian launch facility in Baikonur, Kazakhstan, carrying the Progress cargo ship with Prichal attached to it. After entering space, the cargo ship with the module went into orbit.Progress is also delivering 700 kilos of various cargoes to the space station and is expected to undock from the station on Dec. 22.The first Soyuz spacecraft is expected to dock at the new module on March 18, 2022, with a crew of three cosmonauts: Oleg Artemyev, Denis Matveev and Sergei Korsakov.Earlier this week, the Russian crew on the station started training for the module’s arrival, simulating the use of manual controls in case the automatic docking system failed.The space outpost is currently operated by NASA astronauts Raja Chari, Thomas Marshburn, Kayla Barron, and Mark Vande Hei; Russian cosmonauts Anton Shkaplerov and Pyotr Dubrov; and Matthias Maurer of the European Space Agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-russian-module-docks-with-international-space-station-101637943256069.html

She also urged nations to not panic and focus on the vaccination programmes and strengthen public health measures.“The @WHO technical advisory group on #SARSCoV2 virus evolution will meet today to review what's known and plan further studies,” Swaminathan tweeted. “Meanwhile, we need to focus on strengthening vaccination coverage and public health measures. Let's be cautious, listen to scientists & not panic,” she added.The @WHO technical advisory group on #SARSCoV2 virus evolution will meet today to review what's known and plan further studies. Meanwhile, we need to focus on strengthening vaccination coverage and public health measures. Let's be cautious, listen to scientists & not panic. https://t.co/Kvq6oxZWG3The emphasis on listening to scientists from the WHO’s chief scientist came after the UN health agency’s spokesperson Christian Lindmeier cautioned countries against implementing travel measures. “The WHO recommends that countries continue to apply a risk-based and scientific approach when implementing travel measures,” he said, as several countries imposed restrictions on flights arriving from South Africa, where the variant was first detected, and many more countries mulling such measures.Meanwhile, a virtual meeting of the TAG VE began at 1100 hrs GMT (4.30pm IST) to discuss the classification of the variant, according to a report by AFP. Earlier in the day, technical lead of the WHO’s health emergencies program Maria Van Kerkhove too said that the group would meet to discuss the variant.Also read | A word of caution from WHO as countries rush to impose travel ban on southern Africa“I thank researchers from South Africa and Botswana for sharing information with @WHO & the world about B.1.1.529 variant that has been recently detected. We will convene our TAG-VE again today to discuss. Everyone out there: do not discriminate against countries that share their findings openly,” Kerkhove tweeted.Further, on Thursday, she also said, “There are fewer than a 100 whole genome sequences available. We don’t know very much about this yet. What we do know is that this variant has a large number of mutations. And the concern is that when you have so many mutations it can have an impact on how the virus behaves.”Noting that it might take a few weeks for the global body to understand the impact of the new variant, she said “The TAG VE will discuss if it will become a variant of interest or a variant of concern and if that’s the case then we will give it a Greek name but it is something to watch.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lets-listen-to-scientists-and-not-panic-who-s-chief-scientist-soumya-swaminathan-on-new-coronavirus-variant-101637934248911.html
27-11-2021||World||BioNTech expects more data on new Covid variant in 2 weeks for any vaccine 'adjustment'||BioNTech is expecting more laboratory data on the new coronavirus variant detected in South Africa within two weeks in order to determine the efficacy of its vaccine, the German biotechnology company has said. BioNTech, which developed the most widely used Covid-19 vaccine in the West and is in vaccine alliance with Pfizer, said it has started investigations on the new strain B.1.1.529, reported Reuters. The Mainz-based firm added that more data on the virus variant would help determine whether the current shot would have to be reworked."We understand the concern of experts and have immediately initiated investigations on variant B.1.1.529," the company said."We expect more data from the laboratory tests in two weeks at the latest. These data will provide more information about whether B.1.1.529 could be an escape variant that may require an adjustment of our vaccine if the variant spreads globally," it added.Several European and Asian countries on Friday reacted swiftly to announce travel restrictions on southern Africa to prevent the spread of the variant with a high number of spike mutations. The World Health Organization (WHO), however, cautioned against a hasty approach, saying countries should take a "risk-based and scientific approach" when implementing travel measures."At this point, implementing travel measures is being cautioned against," WHO spokesperson Christian Lindmeier told a UN briefing in Geneva. "The WHO recommends that countries continue to apply a risk-based and scientific approach when implementing travel measures."(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biontech-expects-more-data-on-new-covid-variant-in-2-weeks-for-any-vaccine-adjustment-101637930934179.html
27-11-2021||World||Canada: Physicist Sajeev John develops process to boost solar energy generation||An award-winning Indo-Canadian theoretical physicist Sajeev John has developed a process wherein sunlight can be trapped and confined in ultrathin and flexible silicon sheets, offering a far higher efficiency in generating electricity than conventional solar power technology.Applications based on the research conducted by University of Toronto professor of physics Sajeev John are currently in progress.In an interview with the Hindustan Times, Prof John, who was born in Thiruvalla in Kerala, said his design is based on “the invention of photonic crystals”, the novel materials that can trap and guide light on a microscopic scale. Certain photonic crystal architectures can be very effective in capturing sunlight and making it bounce around for a prolonged time in a thin material. As a result, the light can be absorbed almost completely in a flexible film of silicon only one-tenth the thickness of a human hair, for highly efficient electrical power generation.Traditional silicon cells are not ideal at absorbing a broad range of sunlight. While efficient at absorbing shortwave light, they perform poorly with red or near infrared light. In traditional approaches, silicon is made very thick, at 300 microns, thrice the thickness of a human hair, so as to enhance the absorption of sunlight. The problem is that in such thick solar cells, electrons excited by the sunlight need to travel a long distance to metallic contacts and before that, energy dissipates in the form of heat and some of the sunlight doesn’t get converted to electricity.John’s photonic crystal design is aimed at minimising that wastage with a much thinner structure, only 10 microns thick. “When we can do that and absorb most of the sunlight or more than what they were getting with thick silicon, it means that the photo-generated charge carriers can reach their contacts before they get distracted and de-activated by something else.”He said the photonic crystal architecture allows for cells that are 50% more efficient than those currently in use. Photonic crystals are also known as the “semiconductors of light” because they control photons much like electronic semiconductors control electrons.One utility of the invention is that thin silicon solar cells can be encapsulated in flexible sheets to generate power on surfaces like walls, or even in clothing like a winter coat that can provide a charging facility for devices like cellphones.The invention and development of photonic crystals won John Canada’s highest science and engineering prize, the prestigious Gerhard Herzberg Canada Gold Medal, this month. The award citation said John and his team had “recently applied their light-trapping ideas into the design of flexible, lightweight, thin-film silicon solar cells that can be coated on a variety of surfaces, with unprecedented sunlight capture capabilities and power-conversion efficiencies well beyond that of standard solar panels”.Research groups in the USA, Germany, Australia, and India are collaborating with John on this potentially breakthrough technology and he is hopeful that real world results leading to applications may emerge in about a year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-physicist-sajeev-john-develops-process-to-boost-solar-energy-generation-101637930564848.html
