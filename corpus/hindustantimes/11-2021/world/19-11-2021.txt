This is the third mutation of the coronavirus which originated in the island nation, news agency PTI reported. The health officials have named the variant B.1.617.2. AY 104.Sri Lankan health authorities are yet to ascertain the transmissibility of sub-lineage and have sent the sample to laboratories in Hong Kong for further analysis. Researchers at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura were the first to detect the sub-lineage AY-104.The university’s director of molecular and cell biology department, Dr Chandima Jeewadara, said that AY-104 took the total number of variants originating from Sri Lanka to three.“The first one was B.411, which is a lineage of the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus, the second was B.1.617.2. AY 28 and this is the third one (B.1.617.2. AY 104,” he was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.The SARS-CoV-2 Delta (B.1.617.2) variant is highly transmissible and was responsible for the rapid uptick in coronavirus cases across the globe, even in populations with higher rates of vaccination.Jeewadara said the new variant was detected in north, north-central and southern provinces of the state while further adding that other strains were detected in western province and capital Colombo. He further added that 288 samples were confirmed for AY 104 while 479 tested positive for the AY 28 variant. The AY 104 variant was found after tests were conducted on random samples.Sri Lankan health authorities are monitoring fresh Covid-19 clusters in the nation's north central and southern provinces. They have attributed it to people flouting Covid-19 guidelines during social functions. Sri Lanka’s health minister Keheliya Rambukwella said over 75% of the 16 years of age and 61.8% of the total population received both doses of Covid-19 vaccine. Over 160,000 Sri Lankans over 60 years have also received the Pfizer-BioNTech jab as a third or booster dose as of Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sri-lanka-reports-new-sub-lineage-of-covid-19-s-delta-variant-101637342355042.html

A database maintained by the Board on Geographic Names shows there are currently more than 650 federal sites with names that contain the term.The task force will be made up of representatives from federal land management agencies and experts with the Interior Department. Tribal consultation and public feedback will be part of the process.The process for changing US place names can take years and federal officials said there are currently hundreds of proposed name changes pending before the board.Haaland also called for the creation of an advisory committee to solicit, review and recommend changes to other derogatory geographic and federal place names. That panel will be made up of tribal representatives and civil rights, anthropology and history experts.In the 1960s and 1970s, the Board of Geographic Names took action to eliminate the use of derogatory terms for Blacks and Japanese.There is legislation pending in Congress to address derogatory names on geographic features on public lands. States from Oregon to Maine have passed legislation prohibiting the use of the word “squaw” in place names.In 2020, the Phoenix City Council voted unanimously to rename Squaw Peak Drive to Piestewa Peak Drive, in honor of fallen Native American soldier Lori Piestewa, after it was decried as a demeaning and degrading word.The move came after the council approved a measure that would give the city the right to re-name derogatory street names without residents’ consent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/interior-secretary-seeks-to-remove-derogatory-us-place-names-101637338807859.html

Here's why||US vice-president Kamala Harris will be getting presidential powers transferred on to her from President Joe Biden for a brief moment on Friday when the latter goes for a routine colonoscopy exam at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in the suburbs of Washington. Harris, the first woman, person of color, and person of South Asian descent to be vice-president, will be making history during the short time she is serving as acting president. She is scheduled to travel to Ohio later on Friday once Biden resumes his duties.Biden drove early Friday to the medical center in the Washington suburbs for his first routine physical exam as president. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden would be under anesthesia during the procedure and would transfer power to Harris.“As was the case when president George W. Bush had the same procedure in 2002 and 2007, and following the process set out in the Constitution, President Biden will transfer power to the Vice President for the brief period of time when he is under anesthesia,” she said. “The vice-president will work from her office in the West Wing during this time.”Biden, 78, had his last full exam in December 2019, when doctors found the former vice president to be “healthy, vigorous” and “fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency,” according to a doctor’s report at the time.Biden, who turns 79 on Saturday, is the oldest person to serve as president, and interest in his health has been high since he declared his candidacy for the White House in 2019.Dr. Kevin O’Connor, who has been Biden’s primary care physician since 2009, wrote in a three-page note that the then-presidential candidate was in overall good shape.In that report, O’Connor said that since 2003, Biden has had episodes of atrial fibrillation, a type of irregular heartbeat that’s potentially serious but treatable. At the time, O’Connor cited a list of tests that showed Biden’s heart was functioning normally and his only needed care was a blood thinner to prevent the most worrisome risk, blood clots or stroke.Biden had a brush with death in 1988, requiring surgery to repair two brain aneurysms, weak bulges in arteries, one of them leaking. Biden has never had a recurrence, his doctor said, citing a test in 2014 that examined his arteries.On Friday afternoon, Biden is scheduled to take part in the annual pardoning of the national Thanksgiving turkey.When Biden took office he brought O’Connor back to the White House to continue serving as his doctor, and O'Connor was expected to lead a team of experts in conducting Biden's physical exam Friday.Once the Covid-19 pandemic emerged in early 2020, Biden’s team took intense steps to keep the then-candidate and now-president healthy as the virus raged and took a disproportionate toll among older populations. Biden received his first dose of the Covid-19 vaccines in December 2020 and his second dose just two weeks before taking office. He received a booster dose, which regulators say provides more enduring protection, in late September.The White House said Biden would authorise the release of a medical report, as is customary for presidents and presidential candidates. Former President Donald Trump, 75, was sharply criticized for releasing only cursory details on his health while running and serving in the White House, including concealing the seriousness of his Covid-19 illness a month before the 2020 presidential election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-to-get-us-presidential-powers-for-a-brief-moment-here-s-why-101637335927644.html

These countries also tightened restrictions and Austria became the first European nation to impose a nationwide lockdown to curb the recent spread of Covid-19.'Dramatic situation'German vice chancellor Angela Merkel urged citizens to get vaccinated as the German government introduced tighter restrictions to curb the nation’s highest Covid-19 infection levels since the onset of the pandemic. “The situation is extremely dramatic,” Merkel said.German health minister Jens Spahn also said that Germany may have to transfer Covid-19 patients from one region to another or even to neighbouring nations for treatment. “We are getting to a point where we will have to transfer Covid patients not just within the same region, but to other regions within Germany. And quite possibly even to neighbouring countries,” Spahn was quoted as saying by news agency Deutsche Welle.Germany recorded 52,970 daily new infections on Friday. Bavaria, the German state, canceled all of its popular Christmas markets due to the rise in Covid-19 cases.Austria imposes lockdownAustria imposed a national lockdown to curb cases and asked the entire population to get fully vaccinated by February. “We have not succeeded in convincing enough people to get vaccinated. It hurts that such measures still have to be taken,” Austrian chancellor Alexander Schallenberg said.“There are too many among us who haven’t shown solidarity. Raising the vaccination rate is the only way to break this vicious circle,” Schallenberg was quoted as saying by news agency Bloomberg.The nationwide lockdown will begin from Monday. The nation reported 15,609 new cases in the last 24 hours, the highest since the onset of the pandemic.Russia continues to report record Covid-19 deathsRussia continued to report record Covid-19 deaths on Friday as it recorded 1,254 fresh fatalities along with 37,156 new confirmed cases. It reported 1,251 deaths on Thursday and 1,247 deaths on Wednesday.Russian authorities blamed the recent surge in infection levels on lax attitudes among people and low vaccination rates. Out of Russia’s 146 million people only 40% have been fully vaccinated despite the nation launching Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine ahead of the entire world.The recent spike in cases in Europe have also led to fear among investors who feel that measures to curb the cases could delay the economic recovery. Oil prices also fell on Friday to $78 a barrel as European markets struggled due to the recent surge in cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/record-covid-19-infection-levels-lockdowns-mar-festive-cheer-in-europe-101637333497892.html
19-11-2021||World||Pfizer, Moderna Covid-19 booster shots cleared for all US adults. Final hurdle remains||The United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the federal agency responsible for the control and supervision of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccines, on Friday, opened up booster shots manufactured by Pfizer and Moderna to all adults – expanding the government's campaign to shore up protection and get ahead of rising infections that may worsen with the holidays.What the latest decision, taken by the FDA, implies is that either of the Pfizer or Moderna Covid-19 booster shots can now be administered to anyone 18 or older six months after their last dose – regardless of which vaccine they had at first. However, there still remains the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which must yet agree to expand the Pfizer and Moderna boosters to even healthy young adults. A panel of experts who advise the CDC on vaccine policies are expected to review the evidence and make further guidance for administering booster shots at a meeting on Friday afternoon.If the CDC agrees, tens of millions more Americans could have three doses of protection ahead of the new year. Anyone who got the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine can already get a booster.According to the CDC, more than a third of fully vaccinated senior citizens in the US had already received their booster doses as of Thursday, and 17 per cent of fully vaccinated adults overall have had an additional shot of vaccine.Multiple states in the US –  including Arkansas, California, Colorado, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, New Mexico, and even New York City – have already opted to make booster doses broadly available. In many of those areas, cases are climbing after a slowdown in the summer’s delta-variant-fueled surge.All three Covid-19 vaccines used in the US still offer strong protection against severe illness including hospitalisation and death, but protection against infection can wane with time. (With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-moderna-covid-19-booster-shots-cleared-for-all-us-adults-final-hurdle-remains-101637329549242.html

We demand the Lithuanian side immediately correct its mistaken decision,” the statement said.“The Chinese government expresses strong protest over and firm objection to this extremely egregious act, and will take all necessary measures to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Lithuanian side shall be responsible for all the ensuing consequences,” said the spokesperson.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao later warned Lithuania that it would take “all necessary measures” to safeguard national sovereignty.In September, Lithuania had angered China when its defence ministry recommended that consumers avoid buying Chinese mobile phones and advised people to throw away the ones they have now after a government report found the devices had built-in censorship capabilities.Flagship phones sold in Europe by China’s smartphone giant Xiaomi Corp have a built-in ability to detect and censor terms such as “Free Tibet”, “Long live Taiwan independence” or “democracy movement”, Lithuania’s state-run cybersecurity body said on Tuesday, a Reuters report from Vilnius said in September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lithuania-will-pay-for-what-it-did-says-china-after-it-forges-ties-with-taiwan-101637319248445.html
19-11-2021||World||Covid-19: New study says ‘patient zero’ was vendor at seafood market in Wuhan||The first identified Covid-19 case was a vendor at a seafood market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan and not, as thought earlier, an accountant without any link to the market, a new study published in the journal, Science, said on Thursday.The identification of the account as the first patient with Covid-19 symptoms had added to the speculation that the virus could have leaked from a top virus laboratory located across the Yangtze river from the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, the first pandemic epicentre.The new study adds to the voices that have supported an animal-origin theory.The origin of the Sars-CoV-2 virus, which causes Covid-19 remains a mystery, and a major source of tension between China and several western countries led by the United States.Beijing has consistently denied the lab leak theory, calling it a conspiracy, and claiming instead that cases of the viral fever had been diagnosed in other countries before Wuhan.The new report indicates that the World Health Organization (WHO)-China inquiry into the origins had got the initial chronology of the outbreak wrong.As it turns out, according to virologist Michael Worobey, rather than the original patient being a man who had never been to the Wuhan market, the first known case of Covid-19 turns out to be a woman, a vendor at the market.“His (the accountant’s) symptom onset came after multiple cases in workers at Huanan market, making a female seafood vendor there the earliest known case, with illness onset on December 11,” according to the study done by Worobey, who is head of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Arizona.Worobey argues that community transmission of the disease started at the market. “Given the high transmissibility of Sars-CoV-2 and the high rate of asymptomatic spread, many symptomatic cases would inevitably soon lack a direct link to the location of the pandemic’s origin,” he wrote.“That so many of the >100 Covid-19 cases from December with no identified epidemiologic link to Huanan market nonetheless lived in its direct vicinity is notable and provides compelling evidence that community transmission started at the market,” Worobey said.The virologist went through publicly available data including hospital records and interviews of patients to arrive at this conclusion. “The strength of my article is that it draws on firsthand accounts - including audio/video recordings - of doctors, hospital administrators, and patients like Zhang Jixian, Xia Wenguang, Wei Guixian, Chen Honggang, Ai Fen, and Yuan Yufeng,” Worobey tweeted.“There was a tragic failure of China’s much-touted Pneumonia of Unknown Etiology (PUE) system, where doctors are supposed to report cases of unexplained pneumonia rapidly (I believe within hours) to national authorities through an internet-based platform,” Worobey tweeted.“The new study will add to the ongoing research into the origins of the worst global health crisis in several decades.The WHO proposed last month a new expert panel to investigate the source of the coronavirus.Chinese scientist Yungui Yang of the Beijing Institute of Genomics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences has been included in the Scientific Advisory Group on the Origins of Novel Pathogens (SAGO) - the only Chinese expert named in the 25-member panel.China has warned against “political manipulation” of the renewed WHO probe into the origins of the coronavirus while adding that it would support the investigation.Beijing has dismissed accusations of withholding critical data during an earlier WHO probe into the origins in February, alleging that the investigation had been politicised by the US and that the scope of the search should be widened to other countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-new-study-says-patient-zero-was-vendor-at-seafood-market-in-wuhan-101637318411175.html

19-11-2021||World||Over 28,000 of Afghans seek temporary US entry, only few approved||More than 28,000 Afghans have applied for temporary admission into the U.S. for humanitarian reasons since shortly before the Taliban recaptured Afghanistan and sparked a chaotic U.S. withdrawal, but only about 100 of them have been approved, according to federal officials.U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has struggled to keep up with the surge in applicants to a little-used program known as humanitarian parole but promises it's ramping up staff to address the growing backlog.Afghan families in the U.S. and the immigrant groups supporting them say the slow pace of approvals threatens the safety of their loved ones, who face an uncertain future under the hard-line Islamic government because of their ties to the West.“We're worried for their lives,” says Safi, a Massachusetts resident whose family is sponsoring 21 relatives seeking humanitarian parole. “Sometimes, I think there will be a day when I wake up and receive a call saying that they're no more.”The 38-year-old U.S. permanent resident, who asked that her last name not be used for fear of retribution against her relatives, is hoping to bring over her sister, her uncle and their families. She says the families have been in hiding and their house was destroyed in a recent bombing because her uncle had been a prominent local official before the Taliban took over.The slow pace of approvals is frustrating because families have already paid hundreds if not thousands of dollars in processing fees, says Chiara St. Pierre, an attorney at the International Institute of New England in Lowell, Massachusetts, a refugee resettlement agency assisting Safi's family.Each parole application comes with a $575 filing charge, meaning USCIS, which is primarily fee-funded, is sitting on some $11.5 million from Afghans in the last few months alone, she and other advocates complain.“People are desperate to get their families out,” said St. Pierre, whose nonprofit has filed more than 50 parole applications for Afghan nationals. “Do we not owe a duty to the people left behind, especially when they are following our immigration laws and using the options they have?”Victoria Palmer, a USCIS spokesperson, said the agency has trained 44 additional staff to help address the application surge. As of mid-October, the agency had only six staffers detailed to the program.Of the more than 100 approved as of July 1, some are still in Afghanistan and some have made it to third countries, she said, declining to provide details. The program typically receives fewer than 2,000 requests annually from all nationalities, of which USCIS approves an average of about 500, according to Palmer.Part of the challenge is that humanitarian parole requires an in-person interview, meaning those in Afghanistan need to travel to another county with an operating U.S. embassy or consulate after they've cleared the initial screening. U.S. officials warn it could then take months longer, and there's no guarantee parole will be granted, even after the interview.Humanitarian parole doesn’t provide a path to lawful permanent residence or confer U.S. immigration status. It's meant for foreigners who are unable to go through the asylum or other traditional visa processes, but who need to leave their country urgently.The backlog of parole requests comes on top of the more than 73,000 Afghan refugees already evacuated from the country as part of Operations Allies Welcome, which was focused on Afghans who worked for the U.S. government as interpreters and in other jobs.Most have arrived in the country and have been staying on military bases awaiting resettlement in communities across the country, though about 2,000 still remain overseas awaiting clearance to enter the U.S., according to Palmer.But advocates question some of USCIS's recent decisions for Afghan humanitarian parole, such as prioritizing applications from those already living in other countries. They say that approach is at odds with the program's purpose of helping those most at risk.The Biden administration should instead focus on applications from women and girls, LGBTQ people and religious minorities still in the country, said Sunil Varghese, of the New York-based International Refugee Assistance Project.It could also dispense with some of the financial documentation required for applicants and their sponsors, since Congress has passed legislation making Afghan evacuees eligible for refugee benefits, said Lindsay Gray, CEO of Vecina, an Austin, Texas-based group that trains attorneys and volunteers on immigration matters.Palmer didn't directly address the critiques but said the agency, in each case, determines if there's a “distinct, well-documented reason” to approve humanitarian parole and whether other protections are available. USCIS also considers whether the person already has U.S. ties, such as a family member with legal status or prior work for the U.S. government, among other factors.In the meantime, Afghans in the U.S. have little choice but to wait and fret.Bahara, another Afghan living in Massachusetts who asked her last name be withheld over concerns for her family, says she’s been wracked with guilt for her decision to leave her country to attend a local university.The 29-year-old boarded a plane on Aug. 15 just hours before the Taliban swept into the capital of Kabul, leading to one of the largest mass evacuations in U.S. history.“It was my dream, but it changed completely,” said Bahara, referring to enrolling in a U.S. master’s degree program. “I couldn't stop thinking about my family. I couldn't sleep the first few weeks. All I did was cry, but it didn't help.”Bahara said her family is worried because Taliban officials have been paying unannounced visits to people like her father who worked with the U.S. government after the militant group was originally ousted from power by the U.S. following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.An American family is now sponsoring her family for humanitarian parole, giving Bahara hope even as she grieves over her country's current situation.“I cannot believe how everything just collapsed,” said Bahara, who founded a children's literacy program in Afghanistan. “All the achievements and hard work just added up to zero, and now people are suffering.”Baktash Sharifi Baki, a green-card holder who has been living in the U.S. since 2014, was compelled to take more drastic measures as Afghanistan quickly unraveled this summer.The Philadelphia resident, who served as an interpreter for the U.S. government, traveled back in August in the hopes of shepherding his wife, daughter, mother and godson to safety.But the family wasn’t able to board any of the final commercial flights out of Kabul. Baki has appealed to the U.S. government to allow them to board one of the charter flights that have recently resumed.Meanwhile, a friend in Louisiana has offered to serve as the family’s sponsor for a humanitarian parole application, even covering the costly fees himself.Baki and his family are staying for now with relatives in the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif. But he worries his modest cash savings is dwindling just as the region’s harsh winter sets in and Afghanistan's economic crisis is deepening.“We are really facing a bad situation here,” Baki said. “We need to get out.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-28-000-of-afghans-seek-temporary-us-entry-only-few-approved-101637305309168.html
19-11-2021||World||First Wuhan Covid case days later than initially reported: Scientist||The first case of Covid-19 identified in Wuhan, China and presented as such by the World Health Organization was actually days later than previously believed and at an animal market, a top scientist said in the journal Science Thursday.Rather than the original patient being a man who had never been to the Wuhan market where wild and domestic animals were sold, the first known case of Covid-19 turns out to have been a woman who had worked in the market, virologist Michael Worobey wrote.For Worobey, that key piece of information, and his analysis of other early cases of Covid-19 in the city, clearly tip the scales towards the virus having originated in an animal.With no definitive evidence, debate has raged among experts since the start of the pandemic almost two years ago over the origin of the virus.Worobey was one of the 15 or so experts who in mid-May published a column in Science demanding serious consideration of the thesis that the virus had leaked from a laboratory in Wuhan.In this latest article, he argued that his research into the origin of the outbreak "provides strong evidence of a live-animal market origin of the pandemic."One criticism of the market theory was that because health authorities raised the alert about cases of a suspicious disease linked to the market as early as December 30, 2019, that would have introduced a bias that led to the identification of more cases there than elsewhere, since attention had already been drawn to it.To counter that argument, Worobey analyzed cases reported by two hospitals before the alert was raised.Those cases were also largely linked to the market, and those which were not were nevertheless geographically concentrated around it."In this city of 11 million people, half of the early cases are linked to a place that's the size of a soccer field," Worobey told the New York Times."It becomes very difficult to explain that pattern if the outbreak didn't start at the market."Another criticism of the theory was based on the fact that the first case identified was unrelated to the market.But while the WHO report claimed the man originally identified as patient zero had been ill from December 8, he actually was not sick until December 16, according to Worobey.That deduction was based on a video interview he found, from a case described in a scientific article and from a hospital medical record that matched the 41-year-old man.That would mean the first reported case would be the woman who worked in the market, who fell ill on December 11.Peter Daszak, a disease expert who was on the WHO investigation team, said he was convinced by Worobey's analysis."That December 8 date was a mistake," he told the Times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-wuhan-covid-case-days-later-than-initially-reported-scientist-101637292474952.html

The corpses were found in the area of Cuauhtemoc municipality, the state government said in a statement.The killings were likely linked to a dispute between criminal gangs that operate in the area, the official said. An "intense investigation" was ongoing, the local government said.Gang-related violence in some parts of Mexico has intensified recently, including in the popular tourist zones of Quintana Roo state.President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Wednesday that National Guard troops will permanently deploy to Cancun and the surrounding area following an uptick in violent incidents, including the deaths of two tourists in the resort of Tulum who were caught in gang crossfire.As of September, 21,495 people had died from gang-related violence this year, an average of almost 2,400 per month, according to the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/10-bodies-9-hanging-from-overpass-found-in-central-mexico-101637287525302.html
19-11-2021||World||Greece is the latest European country to restrict the unvaccinated||Greece will tighten restrictions on people unvaccinated against the coronavirus as rising cases and hospitalizations strain the nation’s health systems. It joins Germany, Austria and other European countries in attempting to pressure more people into getting their inoculations.  “Even those who are still hesitant can change their minds by listening to what the unvaccinated who get sick have to say,” Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said in a televised national address on Thursday. Almost nine out of every 10 people in Greek ICUs with Covid-19 are unvaccinated, he said. Mitsotakis said that from Monday, unvaccinated people will lose access to indoor venues including cinemas, theaters, gyms and museums. The government banned their entrance to restaurants, bars and cafes in early November.  “It is a direct act of protection and, of course, an indirect urge to be vaccinated,” Mitsotakis said. Unvaccinated people can still attend church with a negative test, he said. Since restrictions made in early November, Greece has reported some 100,000 new Covid-19 cases, more than the total number of cases for October, and almost 1,000 deaths, pushing total casualties since the start of the pandemic to more than 17,000. Greece’s vaccination numbers have also picked up this month after the earlier round of restrictions. Germany Applies Restrictions on Unvaccinated to Stem Covid SurgeMore than 195,000 people have had a first shot since Nov. 2, around the same as total inoculations in October. Greece started booster shots in late September, and from Friday the third vaccine will be available for everyone 18 years and older. About 65% of Greeks have had at least one vaccine dose, and 62% are fully immunized. That’s much lower than Western European countries like Spain and Italy, and similar to neighboring Turkey, where about 60% are fully vaccinated. As hospitalizations rise, the government on Thursday ordered private doctors to also work with the national health system. The premier said that a rotation system will apply to private and public sector workers to avoid crowding in rush hours on mass transportation. He also announced that those above 60 years old will need to do the third shot in order to keep their vaccination certificates current, and that he plans to request to the European Union president that the EU’s digital vaccine certification show whether people have had a third shot or not.   “Get vaccinated, get vaccinated, get vaccinated,” Mitsotakis said in closing his address.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/greece-is-the-latest-european-country-to-restrict-the-unvaccinated-101637281038350.html
19-11-2021||World||Google signs 5-yr deal to pay for news from AFP||Google has agreed to pay news wire Agence France-Presse for the use of its content, its first deal following a fine from the French regulator over its approach to negotiating compensation for news organizations.The Alphabet Inc. division and AFP struck the accord after months of negotiations, the companies said in a statement Wednesday. The amount wasn’t disclosed. The news agency reported that the deal would cover content in all European Union countries for five years.Web platforms like Google and Facebook have long been reluctant to pay media for using content such as news article extracts in their user feeds. The EU’s so-called neighboring rights law passed in 2019 compelled them to strike payment agreements with the region’s publishers. Google and a group of French press titles excluding AFP struck an initial agreement in January. However, the French competition authority fined Google 500 million euros ($593 million) in July for having failed to negotiate “in good faith” with news outlets. Google appealed the fine.“This agreement with Agence France-Presse demonstrates our willingness to find common ground with publishers and press agencies in France on the topic of neighboring rights,” Sébastien Missoffe, managing director of Google France, said in the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-signs-5-yr-deal-to-pay-for-news-from-afp-101637271586591.html
19-11-2021||World||Joe Biden says US ‘considering’ diplomatic boycott of Beijing Olympics||President Joe Biden said he’s weighing a diplomatic boycott of the upcoming Winter Olympics in Beijing, meaning the U.S. would decline to send a delegation of government officials.It’s “something we’re considering,” Biden said in response to a question during a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Thursday.Some U.S. lawmakers have urged a diplomatic boycott to show American disapproval of recent Chinese economic and military actions and the country’s human-rights abuses in Hong Kong and Xinjiang.Biden and Chinese President Xi Jingping didn’t discuss the Olympics during a 3.5-hour-long virtual summit on Monday, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said after Biden’s remark. In response to a question, Psaki said she didn’t have an update on what the U.S. presence would be.“We have serious concerns about the human rights abuses we’ve seen in Xinjiang,” she said. “And certainly there are a range of factors as we look at what our presence would be.”The Beijing games open Feb. 4. Organizers are under scrutiny for their coronavirus-control measures, which include requiring vaccination for athletes and official delegations. The country is battling outbreaks of the virus in nearly two dozen provinces.A Polish luge coach complained earlier this month that the Chinese have focused more intently on preventing virus transmission than on basic safety measures after one of his athletes was severely injured in a practice run.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-says-us-considering-diplomatic-boycott-of-beijing-olympics-101637265433398.html
19-11-2021||World||New clashes rock Sudan but internet returns after deadly day: Report||Street clashes again shook Khartoum as internet services returned to Sudan on Thursday, a day after 15 protesters were killed in the bloodiest violence since the country's October 25 coup.Wednesday's killings were condemned by UN rights chief Michelle Bachelet who said "it is utterly shameful that live ammunition was again used yesterday against protesters."The demonstrations were organised despite a near-total shutdown of internet services and the disruption of telephone lines amid a crackdown on anti-coup protests that has killed dozens.The European Union also condemned the crackdown, saying the "perpetrators of these violations will be held accountable" and that the blackout must "not prevent the world from being informed about these human rights violations".Since Thursday morning, police fired tear gas to disperse dozens of anti-coup protesters who had stayed on the streets of north Khartoum overnight, witnesses said, braving an intensifying crackdown that has drawn international condemnation.Police tore down makeshift barricades but dozens of protesters returned later to rebuild them and police again fired tear gas to disperse them, witnesses said."Protesters responded by hurling stones at the police," one of them said.Later on Thursday, the official news agency SUNA said "internet services are gradually returning through all telecommunication companies."AFP journalists were able to access the internet, including social media networks.'Stop the repression' On October 25, top general Abdel Fattah al-Burhan -- Sudan's de facto leader since the April 2019 ouster of longtime autocrat Omar al-Bashir -- detained the civilian leadership and declared a state of emergency.The move upended Sudan's fragile transition to full civilian rule, drawing international condemnation and a flurry of punitive measures and aid cuts.Burhan insists the military's move "was not a coup" but a step to "rectify the course of the transition" to civilian rule.Thousands took to the streets on Wednesday in Khartoum and other cities but were met by the deadliest crackdown since the coup.At least 15 people were killed, most of them in north Khartoum, doctors said, raising the overall toll since the coup to 39 dead.Police said they had recorded only one death among protesters in north Khartoum. Another 30 had suffered breathing difficulties from tear gas inhalation.They said they had fired no live rounds and used only "minimum force", even as 89 officers were wounded, some of them critically.By Thursday morning, phone lines had been restored before internet services returned.Bridges connecting Khartoum with its neighbouring cities reopened and traffic returned to many of the capital's streets.UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Association Clement Voule said he had "received alarming reports of increased use of lethal force by the military against peaceful protesters".He called on the international community to "put pressure on Sudan to immediately stop the repression against civilians and respect their rights"."We condemn violence towards peaceful protesters and call for the respect and protection of human rights in Sudan," the US State Department's Bureau of African Affairs said on Twitter.Call for 'peaceful protests' Last week, Burhan formed a new Sovereign Council, the highest transitional authority, with himself as chief and military figures and ex-rebel leaders keeping their posts.He replaced members from the Forces for Freedom and Change, Sudan's main civilian bloc, with little-known figures.The FFC is an umbrella alliance that spearheaded the protests which led to the ouster of Bashir in 2019, and its mainstream faction has supported the anti-coup protests of recent weeks.Sudan's largest political faction, the Umma Party, condemned the use of force by the security forces and called for peaceful protests to continue "until the coup is brought down" and those who have committed crimes against the people have been held accountable.Since the coup, Burhan has removed clauses referring to the FFC from the 2019 power-sharing deal between the military and the civilians from the bloc.This week, US Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Molly Phee met with the generals and the ousted civilian government in a bid to broker a way out of the crisis.Phee has called for the reinstatement of ousted Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, who is effectively under house arrest.Burhan has vowed to hold the planned elections in 2023, reiterating to Phee on Tuesday that his actions aimed to "correct the trajectory of the revolution".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-clashes-rock-sudan-but-internet-returns-after-deadly-day-report-101637264484710.html
19-11-2021||World||Pak in damage control mode after Bangladesh reacts strongly to hoisting of flag||Several Bangladeshi cricket fans were angered after the Pakistan cricket team hoisted the Pakistani flag in the Mirpur ground in Dhaka on Tuesday. The Bangladeshi citizens did not like the act and also felt it was a political gesture ahead of the golden jubilee celebrations of Bangladesh's independence.The Pakistani cricket team is currently in Bangladesh where it is scheduled to play three T20 matches and two test matches. Bangladesh is celebrating 50 years of its independence. The southeast Asian nation, a close neighbour of India, freed itself from the rule of Pakistan after a hard-fought battle with help from the Indian Army in 1971.According to people familiar with the development, Bangladesh minister Dr Murad Hasan was unimpressed by the incident. Hasan also said that the team be sent back with the flag. “Pakistan cricketers hoisted their national flag during practice. This is not acceptable under any circumstances. I can't support it in any manner,” Hasan said.During any sporting event, it is common practice to hoist the national flags of the participating countries before a fixture but hoisting it during the practice match by the Pakistan national team stirred controversy.“Father of the nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's daughter and prime minister Sheikh Hasina took Bangladesh cricket to new heights through various initiatives. Pakistan team’s practice of hoisting the national flag in Dhaka is a great blow to our national spirit at a time when Bangladesh is celebrating the golden jubilee of its independence from Pakistan and Mujib Borsho marking birth centenary of Bangabandhu,” Hasan further added.Civil society body Nirmul Committee, which was formed to track down and put killers and collaborators of Pakistan during the 1971 war, also condemned the move and said it was ‘intentionally’ disrespectful towards Bangladesh as it celebrates the golden jubilee of its independence.Pakistan Cricket Board, however, went into damage control mode saying that coach Saqlain Mushtaq began this practice two months earlier. “ Saqlain Mushtaq launched the practice to boost the team's morale,” visiting team manager Ibrahim Badizi told news agency BBC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-in-damage-control-mode-after-bangladesh-reacts-strongly-to-hoisting-of-flag-101637244363678.html
