We expressed firm opposition to this and made solemn representations to the Indian side,” Wu added.“China’s position on the China-India boundary issue is clear and unambiguous: The Chinese border troops are determined to safeguard national sovereignty and security. At the same time, they are committed to maintaining peace and tranquillity in the border area and make great efforts to ease and cool down the situation,” Wu said.“As a neighbouring country, we hope that India and China will meet each other halfway, jointly maintain peace and tranquillity in the border area, and jointly maintain the sound development of bilateral relations,” the spokesperson said.Indian and Chinese militaries have been locked in a border standoff in eastern Ladakh since May, 2020, when a violent clash in Pangong lake area led to both sides gradually deploying tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry along the border.Several rounds of military and diplomatic talks have only resulted in partial disengagement of troops until now.In October, China accused India of “unreasonable and unrealistic demands” in an unusually aggressive statement issued at the end of the 13th round of military talks held to resolve the dragging standoff in the Ladakh area.India has repeatedly and consistently rejected China’s allegations that Indian troops crossed over to the Chinese side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, asserting that New Delhi has always taken a responsible approach towards border management and maintaining peace and tranquillity in the border areas.Russia, India, China foreign ministers to meetThe foreign ministers of Russia, India and China (RIC) will hold their annual meeting via video link on Friday, the Chinese foreign ministry announced on Thursday.Friday’s meeting will be the 18th round of talks between the three countries under the RIC mechanism.Chinese state councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi will attend the RIC foriegn ministers meeting via video link on November 26, foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian announced on Thursday.Wang will join Indian external affairs minister S Jaishankar and Russia foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov in the meeting.Under the RIC framework, the foreign ministers of the three countries meet periodically to discuss bilateral, regional and international issues of their interest. “During the upcoming meeting, China expects to boost communications, strengthen mutual trust and reach a consensus with Russia and India, sending a positive signal to the world,” Zhao said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-lodges-protest-over-cds-rawat-calling-it-india-s-biggest-security-threat-101637847869334.html
25-11-2021||World||WHO discusses new Covid variant possibly evolved in untreated AIDS patient. What we know so far||World Health Organization (WHO) officials on Thursday met to discuss a new coronavirus variant carrying an “unusual constellation of mutations”. The coronavirus variant B.1.1529 has been identified circulating in South Africa and Botswana, triggering fresh concerns of another Covid-19 wave in the region. The identification of the new variant prompted a hastily-called press conference by virologist Tulio de Oliveira."Unfortunately we have detected a new variant which is a reason for concern in South Africa," de Oliveira told the news conference.South Africa was the first country to detect the Beta variant, which was later labelled as a ‘variant of concern’ by the UN health agency due to its transmissibility and ability to evade vaccine-induced immunity. The National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) said in a statement that the South African scientists are working to understand the potential implications of the new variant found in 22 Covid cases following genome sequencing."Although the data are limited, our experts are working overtime with all the established surveillance systems to understand the new variant and what the potential implications could be," the statement quoted the NICD's Professor Adrian Puren as saying.Scientists detect new Covid-19 variant in South Africa: ReportOn Wednesday, Francois Balloux, professor of computational systems biology and director at UCL Genetics Institute, said that the variant likely evolved during chronic infection of an immunocompromised person, given the large number of mutations it has accumulated apparently in a single burst. In a press release by Science Media Centre, Balloux said the immunocompromised person was possibly an untreated HIV/AIDS patient.“It is difficult to know what to make of the carriage of both P681H and N679K. It is a combination we see only exceptionally rarely. I suspect it is generally not ‘stable’, but it might be so, in combination with other mutations/deletions,” the expert said.“I would definitely expect it to be poorly recognised by neutralising antibodies relative to Alpha or Delta. It is difficult to predict how transmissible it may be at this stage,” he added.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-discusses-new-covid-variant-possibly-evolved-in-untreated-aids-patient-what-do-we-know-so-far-101637839602963.html
25-11-2021||World||Amid Europe’s Covid-19 crisis, UK paying deadly price. Here's why||The U.K.’s success at avoiding the latest virus emergency ripping across the European continent has come at a price.Thanks to an aggressive booster campaign for older and vulnerable people, the country has managed to keep hospitalization and death rates relatively steady without imposing fresh restrictions. Meanwhile, lockdowns are being reimposed elsewhere in a bid to damp down another Covid wildfire.However, more U.K. residents have died of Covid per capita than in most other western European countries, despite earlier access to vaccines than in the European Union.  “The U.K. has been ‘running hot’,” said Devi Sridhar, a professor of global public health at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. “We act like Europe is so much worse, but we’ve just accepted a higher death toll and higher infection rates for longer.”The tally of deaths has risen in particular since July, when Prime Minister Boris Johnson scrapped all restrictions, even mandatory masks. Daily numbers are currently running almost five times higher than in the weeks before his much-ballyhooed “Freedom Day.” The varying virus trends across countries have created an intense political debate about the best way to beat back the pandemic’s latest wave. Austria has gone for a full lockdown and threatened to make vaccinations compulsory, while Italy and Germany are toughening measures on the unvaccinated.The U.K. is the poster child of the opposing strategy, instead relying heavily on boosters to keep deaths and hospitalizations to a manageable level. Johnson has warned of a Covid “blizzard from the east” but indicated there’s no plan to change the rules on masks or to adopt vaccine certificates, which many EU countries have imposed. While Britain looks in better shape now, at least relative to some of its neighbors, it’s still unclear how the two models will play out over the Christmas holidays and beyond. During a previous Covid wave last winter, the U.K. initially pushed down virus numbers more quickly than EU countries, only to see cases flare anew later in the new year. That spike was subsequently contained amid a rapid vaccine rollout. But national immunization rates alone don’t tell the whole story. In Germany, only about 86% of the population age 60 and up -- a bracket that accounts for more than 90% of the country’s Covid deaths -- has been vaccinated, meaning 3.4 million highly vulnerable people have yet to receive shots. In the U.K., significantly more than 90% of that age group has been inoculated.One thing that EU countries can learn from the U.K. is the importance of zeroing in on the people who most need shots, said Mike Ryan, head of the World Health Organization’s health emergencies program.“Governments should know exactly who has not been vaccinated and move away from blunt percentages to missed individuals,” he said Wednesday. “The U.K. has really led the world in how to look at data.”Given the stakes for health-care systems and economies, some European health officials say governments don’t have the luxury to pick and choose their policies. In their view, whatever can be done, must be done.The alternative is an “overload in the health system over the next two months,” said Andrea Ammon, director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. “We do not have the choice between either vaccination or non-pharmaceutical interventions. We have to do both.”Meanwhile, politicians are scrambling to get control of the situation in their respective countries. Slovakia, which has had among the world’s worst increases in cases in the past week, on Wednesday announced a new lockdown. France, on the other hand, is following the U.K. and resisting such dramatic moves. With just months to go before President Emmanuel Macron faces elections, the government says it wants to avoid “closures, curfews or lockdowns.”Exactly why the U.K.’s high Covid case numbers have not resulted in more deaths of late is probably due to a complicated mix of factors. The country reported more than 43,000 new infections on Wednesday, among the highest levels in Europe and consistent with daily tallies since July, along with 149 deaths. Boosters may be helping to protect the most vulnerable. Almost 16 million people have received their third shot, versus 6.6 million in Germany.The sluggish vaccine rollout for young people could also be a factor. The spread of infections has been particularly pronounced among school goers, and children are less likely to suffer severe illness or die from Covid.“It’s all about population immunity,” said David Heymann, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “Population immunity in the U.K. is likely very high because the virus has been permitted to circulate in the communities.” AstraZeneca Plc Chief Executive Pascal Soriot claimed this week that the U.K.’s heavy reliance on the company’s vaccine for older people, might be helping to hold down the death rate. The Astra shot, he said, may offer greater long-term effectiveness -- something U.K. scientists have shown is not the case.“The U.K. has more immunity than many places, because of both infections and vaccination,” said Graham Medley, a member of the government’s Covid advisory panel and an LSHTM professor. “If people keep getting vaccinated and getting their boosters, and keep testing to limit transmission, then the U.K. might not have to introduce any more measures to reduce the number of patients in hospital.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-europe-s-covid-19-crisis-uk-paying-deadly-price-here-s-why-101637837810426.html
25-11-2021||World||Canada’s British Columbia feels the effects of climate change||Forty-five-year-old Windy Corduroy, a resident of Chilliwack, drove up to Abbotsford on November 15 for an appointment, a 30-minute drive on an ordinary day. Within hours, it was no longer possible for her to go back because of the extensive flooding on the highway. Corduroy is one the many Canadians who have been affected by landslides and flooding in British Columbia last week brought on by massive rains, which experts say have been made worse by climate change.A weather system known as an “atmospheric river” resulted in huge storm hitting Pacific north-west last week. “Atmospheric rivers are relatively long, narrow regions in the atmosphere – like rivers in the sky – that transport most of the water vapour outside of the tropics”, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration website. They move with the weather, dumping the water vapour that they carry in the form of rain or snow once they make landfall. “The west coast of Canada is accustomed to wet winters, especially during La Nina events like the one we are experiencing. But nothing like this has happened before,” says Dr Simon Donner Professor of Climatology at the University of British Columbia. “Rainfall during this ‘atmospheric river’ event absolutely shattered records.”The highest rainfall was seen along the border between US and Canada. The Canadian province of British Columbia received 150 to 200 mm of rain, with some places receiving more than a months rain in two days. Canadian officials called the resulting deluge a “once-in-a-year” event, meaning that a flood of this size has a 0.2% (1 in 500) chance of occurring in any given year.Also Read: Catch them young: School climate education key for sustainable developmentAt least four deaths have been reported so far and thousands have been displaced. Canada’s third largest city and largest port, Vancouver, was completely cut off after it lost its rail and road links to landslides and destruction caused by the water.After it rained over the weekend, “The water became too much for the ditches, and the ground became too saturated, recounts Lindsay Kay, 31, a resident of the city of Chilliwack. “Our crawlspace began to fill up with water, and we began looking for ways to keep it out. We spent most of the night pumping water out of the crawlspace, but on Monday night we were notified that we were on evacuation alert, and early Tuesday morning we were advised that we would have to leave.”At the moment, Kay, her husband and her 9-month-old son, are staying with friends. They have a short term accommodation covered, and also have someplace to rent long term just in case. But they are holding on hope that they will still be able to go back home.“We know that so many people have been absolutely devastated by this flood. Not only did many lose their homes, but so many lost their businesses, livelihoods and animals as well,” says Kay.The Oryall family own a small hobby farm in Arnold, a small settlement on the western edge of the Sumas Prairie. They used to have more than forty chickens before the flooding, but only twelve of them survived the flooding, says Lindsey. On Tuesday, they began evacuating around 6am in the morning. Their main floor, despite being a few feet above the ground, was completely flooding.Lindsey and her husband, Ben, dropped their two children Charlie, 7, and Oliver, 3, and their dog off at her parents’ house in Chilliwack and then came back to evacuate their animals.“When we went back it was about 9:30, and we left at about 10:15, and in that 45 minutes, the water came up about two and a half feet and we — my husband and I — almost didn’t make it out safely,” she says.The signal from climate change The Oryall family moved into the farm on June 15. Now, just a few months later, they are already wondering if selling might be a good idea. “We have been looking for a farm like this for about eight years. We have been looking for our forever home and we finally found it. We are very happy,” says Lindsay.But her husband, she says, is having second thoughts mainly because of climate change. “If we’re going to have to go through this, even every ten years, with climate change continuing to get worse, how are we going to be able to afford this?”The family lives on floodplain, and like many others on the Sumas prairie, which is a high flood risk are, don’t have flood insurance. “This has been a devastating this for us financially,” she says. “We can see the signal of climate change in the intensity of the rainfall. It follows from basic physics that a warmer planet means heavier rainfall. Research also shows that the winter storm track will move north, bringing more intense rains to British Columbia,” says Dr. Donner, adding, “Whether rainfall turns into flooding, however, is very much about land use planning, and that planning is based on a past climate.”The floods don’t come completely unexpected. According to a Vancouver Sun report, scientists have been warning for at least three decades that British Columbia was facing a threat from climate change. A report from the auditor general in 2018 that warned that the “the province needs to be prepared” for the impact of climate change.“From 1900 to 2013, B.C.’s average temperature has increased faster than the global average. Scientists predict that the province will face increases in extreme weather, rising sea levels, increasing risk of wildfire and flooding, as well as a change in the location of ecosystems and species that live there,” it said, adding, “These events highlight the environmental, economic and social threats that climate change poses to the province.”The province has been forced to declare a climate-related state of emergency twice in the last six months. Over the summer, record-breaking temperatures resulted in a drought and wildfires. On June 29, temperatures reached as high as 49.6 degree Celsius (°C), breaking a previous record of 45.0°C set in July 1937.At least 569 people died between June and August as a result of the heat, and with more than 1,600 fires, the wildfire season this year was the third worst on record for the province, torching nearly 8,700 square kilometres of land. It consumed the village of Lytton, where at least two died.“The summer heat wave was an extremely rare event, but one that will become more likely to happen as the climate continues to warm,” says Dr Donner. “The forensic analysis done by a group of scientists found that the likelihood of such a heat wave may increase more than 100 times with 2 degrees of global warming.”At the moment, a key COP 26 climate conference report has concluded that the world is on track for more than 2°C of global heating. The extremely warm BC summer may also have had hand in why the floods were so particularly devastating. The fires and drought scorched the land in a way leaving it incapable of absorbing water. For now, it is difficult to tell extent of the damage that the region is facing till the flood waters recede.Unfortunately, it may not be any time soon. In another huge blow to the province, heavy rains have been forecasted for the region starting today. “The next storm system is set to arrive on the B.C. south coast tonight bringing heavy rain. The rain will be heaviest on Thursday as the storm moves across the south coast. The heavy rain will ease Thursday night as the system moves out of the region,” according to Environment Canada.“This may worsen recent flooding and impact vulnerable landscapes and infrastructure,” it added.“This year has been very tough on us in BC. From Covid, the intense heat in summer, wildfires, and now the flooding. We’ve gone from one disaster to the next, with no time to recuperate,” rues Corduroy. “Hopefully our government will make the right choices for a better future.”“The core threat is that the climate is changing faster than we are able or willing to adapt,” says Donner. “We need to start planning now for the future climate - we need to consider climate change when we design our communities and build our homes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadas-british-columbia-feels-the-effects-of-climate-change-101637843369219.html
25-11-2021||World||Scientists detect new Covid-19 variant in South Africa: Report||Scientists in South Africa have detected a new variant of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) with multiple mutations, news agency AFP reported on Thursday.

25-11-2021||World||France, UK vow action after deadliest English Channel migrant tragedy||Britain and France were on Thursday looking at new measures to limit migration across the Channel and break people-smuggling networks after at least 27 migrants trying to reach England drowned off the northern French coast.The disaster is the deadliest accident since the Channel in 2018 became a hub for migrants from the Africa, the Middle East and Asia who have been increasingly using small boats to reach England from France.President Emmanuel Macron, after vowing France would not allow the Channel to become a "cemetery", spoke to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson to agree on stepping up efforts to thwart the traffickers blamed for the surge in crossings.Prime Minister Jean Castex also held a crisis meeting on Thursday with ministers to discuss new measures, his office said.Seventeen men, seven women and three minors died when the inflatable boat lost air and took on water off the northern port of Calais on Wednesday, according to public prosecutors in Lille. A manslaughter probe has been opened.The disaster poses a new challenge to cooperation between France and Britain after Brexit. Initial statements from both sides pinning responsibility on the other party to act indicated the tragedy will not be an automatic catalyst for cooperation.Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said a total of five suspected traffickers accused of being directly linked to the doomed crossing had been arrested, the fifth man suspected of buying inflatable boats for the crossing.Darmanin said only two survivors, an Iraqi and Somali, had been found and they were recovering from extreme hypothermia and would eventually be questioned.Calais mayor Natacha Bouchart said a pregnant woman was also one of the victims.Persuading our partnersIn telephone talks, Johnson and Macron agreed on the "urgency of stepping up joint efforts to prevent these deadly crossings" and that "it is vital to keep all options on the table" to break the business model of the smuggling gangs, according to Downing Street.But Johnson told British media London had faced "difficulties persuading some of our partners, particularly the French, to do things in a way that the situation deserves".And in a terse readout of the talks, the Elysee Palace said Macron told Johnson that France and the UK have a "shared responsibility" and added he "expected the British to cooperate fully and refrain from exploiting a dramatic situation for political ends".British officials said Johnson renewed an offer to send police and border forces to France to carry out joint patrols along the Channel coast -- an idea that has been rebuffed by Paris in the past.In a sign of the tensions, Britain's biggest-selling tabloid newspapers all carried a front-page picture of a French police vehicle apparently sitting idly by as migrants entered the waters off northern France.More than 25,700 people have made the cross-Channel journey in small boats this year -- three times the total for the whole of 2020, according to data compiled by Britain's PA news agency.Darmanin insisted that Paris was doing all it could to break the trafficking networks, saying France had arrested 1,500 people smugglers since the start of the year and accusing them of operating like "mafia organisations".He was due to hold new talks with British counterpart Priti Patel later Thursday.No other choiceFrench officials said earlier three helicopters and three boats had searched the area, finding corpses and people unconscious in the water, after a fisherman sounded the alarm.The boat had set off from the coast at Dunkirk before hitting trouble off Calais to the west, a source close to the investigation said.One of the French lifeboat workers, Charles Devos, described seeing "a flat, deflated inflatable boat with the little air that remained helping it float" surrounded by bodies of the drowned.Pierre Roques of the Auberge des Migrants NGO in Calais said the Channel risked becoming as deadly as the Mediterranean, which has seen a much higher toll from migrant crossings."People are dying in the Channel, which is becoming a cemetery. And as England is right opposite, people will continue to cross," he said.A Sudanese man aged 30, Armed, told AFP in Calais after being rescued following a failed attempt to cross that he was aware of the tragedy but it would not stop him trying again."It's terrible, but I'll try it again and again. I have no other choice. I know it is dangerous. I know I'm risking my life. But I have no other choice," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-uk-vow-action-after-deadliest-english-channel-migrant-tragedy-101637838438991.html

Taliban spokesperson for the interior ministry, Qari Saeed Khosty, earlier claimed that the ruling Sunni Pashtun group has finalised a deal with Cpharm for setting up a cannabis processing plant and the work may begin within days.In a series of tweets, Khosty said Taliban officials from the interior ministry’s counter-narcotics department met a representative of a company named Cpharm that wants to set up a cannabis processing plant in Afghanistan. The company needs 30 acres of land to cultivate cannabis and is prepared to invest $430 million in this project to create all cannabis products, he added.“It is worth mentioning that all stages of the contract with the mentioned company have been completed and this project will officially start in the coming days,” Khosty tweeted.The surprise announcement by the Taliban spokesperson left a small Maitland-based company Cpharm inundated with requests for comment. The company clarified that it has nothing to do with the apparent deal with the Taliban, adding that it does not manufacture or supply any products and only provide medical advice to the Australian pharmaceutical industry."We have become aware overnight of numerous media articles stating that Cpharm in Australia has been involved in a deal with the Taliban to be involved in the supply of cannabis in a cream. We have been contacted today by numerous media outlets around the world regarding this," Cpharma said in a statement."We have no connection with cannabis or the Taliban. We have no idea where the Taliban media release has come from and want to assure everyone that it should not be connected to Cpharm Pty Ltd Australia," the company added in a media advisory statement,” the company added.(With inputs from agency)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-signs-deal-with-cpharm-for-cannabis-processing-australian-company-says-no-idea-101637836773317.html

The US stated that these companies were aiding to develop the Chinese military’s quantum computing efforts, according to Reuters.As many as eight China-based technology companies were added in the ‘Entity list’ not only for their alleged role in assisting the Chinese military but also acquiring or attempting to acquire “US-origin items in support of military applications.”In a statement, US commerce secretary Gina Raimondo said the new listings will help prevent the country’s technology from backing the development of Chinese and Russian “military advancement and activities of non-proliferation concern,” including Pakistan's “unsafeguarded nuclear activities or ballistic missile programme.”Also Read | Blacklisted Chinese firms eye lawsuits after Xiaomi win against Trump banChina’s embassy in Washington “firmly” opposed the blacklist move, with spokesperson Liu Pengyu saying that the US uses the “catch-all concept of national security” and “abuses” its power to muzzle and restrain “Chinese enterprises in all possible means.”He added that the US needs to meet China “halfway instead of going further down the wrong path,” the Reuters report revealed.Also Read | US adds Russia, China and 8 others to religious freedom blacklistThis development comes at a time the two nations are at loggerheads with each other over Taiwan’s status and trade issues. Notably, during the recent virtual meeting between US President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, the world leaders discussed trade among several other topics.Meanwhile, the reported eight Chinese companies are not the only ones that have been blacklisted by the US. A total of 27 new entities were added and the list is diverse with inclusions from Pakistan, Japan and Singapore besides China.Names of Chinese firms blacklisted:1.     Hangzhou Zhongke Microelectronics Co Ltd2.     New H3C Semiconductor Technologies Co Ltd3.     Xi'an Aerospace Huaxun Technology4.     Hunan Goke Microelectronics5.     Yunchip Microelectronics6.     Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale7.     QuantumCTek8.     Shanghai QuantumCTeck Co LtdThe US commerce department told Reuters that the blacklist move was aimed at stopping the Chinese military from developing its counter-stealth technology that could include equipment such as advanced radars, and even counter submarine applications like undersea sensors.Suppliers to the firms in the US entity list will require a license before they can sell items, and that is likely to be denied as well.The US has been increasingly and consistently using its ‘Entity list’ to blacklist companies for the sake of foreign policy and national security, and it was started since former President Donald Trump’s administration. In 2019, Chinese telecom firm Huawei was added to the list, cutting them off vital suppliers, thereby making handset production difficult.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/8-chinese-firms-blacklisted-in-us-over-national-security-reasons-101637824312231.html
25-11-2021||World||Libya: Gaddafi's son disqualified from running for president in Dec polls||Libya’s top electoral body on Wednesday disqualified the son and onetime heir apparent of the late dictator Muammar al-Gaddafi from running for president in elections to be held next month, citing his previous convictions.The name of Seif al-Islam Gaddafi appeared on a list of ineligible candidates issued by the country’s High National Elections Committee. He can appeal the decision in court in the coming days.Seif al-Islam had been sentenced to death by a Tripoli court in 2015 for using violence against protesters in a 2011 uprising against his father, but that ruling has since been called into question by Libya’s rival authorities. He is also wanted by the International Criminal Court on charges of crimes against humanity related to the uprising.Libya is set to hold the first round of presidential elections on December 24, after years of UN-led attempts to usher in a more democratic future and end the country’s civil war.Adding to the concerns surrounding the election, the UN’s top envoy for Libya submitted his resignation last week, though he said Wednesday he is prepared to stay on through the vote if needed.Following the 2011 overthrow and killing of Moammar Gaddafi, oil-rich Libya spent most of the last decade split between rival governments — one based in the capital, Tripoli, and the other in the eastern part of the country.Each side in the civil war has also had the support of mercenaries and foreign forces from Turkey, Russia and Syria and other regional powers.The son of Libya’s former dictator submitted his candidacy papers in the southern town of Sabha on November 14.It was the first time in years that the 49-year-old, who earned a PhD at the London School of Economics, appeared in public.He had been captured by fighters in the town of Zintan late in 2011, as the uprising ended his father’s rule after 40 years. Seif al-Islam was released in June 2017.The announcement of his possible candidacy stirred controversy across the divided country, where a number of other high-profile candidates have also emerged in recent weeks. Among them are powerful military commander Khalifa Hifter and the country’s interim prime minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibah.The long-awaited vote still faces challenges, including unresolved issues over laws governing the elections, and occasional infighting among armed groups. Other obstacles include the deep rift that remains between the country’s east and west and the presence of thousands of foreign fighters and troops.Meanwhile, UN envoy Jan Kubis submitted his resignation last week, though it didn’t become public until Tuesday.The Geneva-based diplomat serves as both special envoy for Libya and head of the UN political mission in the country. He told the Security Council on Wednesday that he is leaving to facilitate a change he considers vital: moving the mission chief’s job to Tripoli to be on the ground at a high-stakes moment for Libya.The idea divided the council during discussions in September. Western countries embraced it; Russia rejected it.Kubis added that he was ready to continue as special envoy through the election, though he said the UN had accepted his resignation with a December 10 effective date.Asked about the discrepancy, UN spokesperson Farhan Haq said the organisation would “continue to work with him while we’re seeking a successor.”The job was open for nearly a year before being filled by Kubis, a former Slovak foreign minister and UN official in Iraq and Afghanistan.The Security Council emphasized the importance of the upcoming election Wednesday, urging an “inclusive and consultative electoral process,” warning against violence and disinformation and calling for Libyans to accept the results of the vote.Libyan Ambassador Taher El Sonni said his country appreciates “all international initiatives with genuine intentions,” but he said the council’s members need “to heed us, too” and let Libyans lead their own way out of crisis.“You have a moral responsibility towards the developments in my country over the past 10 years,” he told the group. “Don’t belittle us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/libya-gaddafi-s-son-disqualified-from-running-for-president-in-dec-polls-101637818465633.html

Evie Toombes wants millions in damages from Dr Philip Mitchell.According to Daily Mail, she was born with lipomyelomeningocele (LMM) right after her birth. Also known as spina bifida, the rare condition did not allow her spinal cord did not develop properly in the womb, which caused permanent disability. The showjumping star claims the doctor did not advise her mother Caroline Toombes to take folic acid to avoid the child being 'born in a damaged state', Daily Mail reported.Toombes mother, now 50, became pregnant in 2001 and was advised by Dr Mitchell to take folic acid but was not told of its importance in spina bifida prevention. Caroline said the doctor told her if she was taking a good diet, she would not have to take folic acid.The doctor, however, has denied any liability, claiming he gave Caroline Toombes "reasonable advice".Evie Toombes' lawyer says is Caroline had put off getting pregnant, she would have had a normal, healthy baby.Due to her condition, Evie's mobility is said to be very limited, and she will have to use a wheelchair more and more as she grows older.She now works at Nottingham University and educates children about invisible illnesses. Evie also has her own website.In 2018, she met the Duke of Sussex and Meghan Markle when she won the Inspiration Young Person Award at a charity event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-should-never-have-been-born-woman-with-spina-bifida-sues-doctor-101637816389729.html
25-11-2021||World||Germany's Covid-19 death toll crosses 100,000; infections still spiking||Germany passed the threshold of 100,000 Covid-19 deaths, with the latest wave of the pandemic still pushing new infections higher and hospitals in some hotspots under severe pressure.Since the pandemic took hold at the beginning of last year, 100,119 people have died from the virus, according to the latest data from the RKI public-health institute. The number roughly equals the population of mid-sized German cities like Erlangen or Guetersloh, the home towns of Siemens Healthineers AG and media firm Bertelsmann SE respectively.Germany’s death toll is still lower than in the UK, France or Italy, which each passed 100,000 some time ago. The US has recorded the most deaths with more than 770,000, following by Brazil with over 610,000, according to the Bloomberg Covid-19 Tracker.The number of daily fatalities in Germany is only about a fifth of the level seen last winter, with about 68% of the population fully vaccinated against the disease.Germany’s hospitals are nonetheless becoming increasingly overwhelmed in some regions, and the government’s latest measures have yet to show a tangible effect.Chancellor Angela Merkel and regional leaders agreed last week to restrict access to restaurants, bars and public events for unvaccinated people in hard-hit areas, and the curbs are taking effect across most of the country.With infections climbing further and authorities slow to act amid a change in power, experts warn that another lockdown like in neighboring Austria could become unavoidable, inflicting more damage on Europe’s biggest economy and delaying its recovery.The prospect of tighter restrictions ahead of the Christmas season is “a catastrophe,” according to Marc Tenbieg from lobby group Deutscher Mittelstands-Bund, which represents the small and medium-sized companies that make up the backbone of the German economy.The association backs curbs to fight the pandemic, Tenbieg said, though he criticized political leaders for reacting “far too late.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germanys-covid-19-death-toll-crosses-100-000-infections-still-spiking-101637809565226.html
25-11-2021||World||Pakistan's petroleum dealers to launch nationwide strike today||Petroleum dealers in Pakistan will go on a nationwide strike on Thursday, accusing the Imran Khan-led government of failing to increase the profit margin for the dealers, the Pakistan Petroleum Dealers Association (PPDA) said.Though the PPDA did not mention when the strike will end, the association's chairman Abdul Sami Khan said that it will start at 6am (local time) on Thursday, according to a report by Dawn.Issuing a handout, the PPDA said that a meeting of petroleum dealers was held in Lahore on November 20, where it was pointed out that the Pakistani government would raise the profit margin three years back.The PPDA added that the above promise is still not fulfilled and it has become difficult for dealers to run fuel stations due to growing inflation and an increase in the prices of petroleum products, the Dawn report also said.Previously, the dealers had announced the strike on November 5 but withdrew it after a government delegation held a meeting with them on November 3 to fulfil their demands.The meeting led to the formation of a panel to ensure implementation of the agreement for an increase in profit margin through approval from the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) and the federal cabinet by November 15, Dawn further reported.According to another statement, the government agreed to raise the profit margin by 6% and sought time till November 17 to implement the decision. But the government did not seem serious about this decision, the statement added.Meanwhile, a day before the strike, traffic jams were reported in major cities of Pakistan including Islamabad, Rawalpindi and Karachi. Videos and posts on social media showed long queues at petrol stations in these cities as people hurried to fill fuel in their vehicles.Pakistan's petroleum ministry has assured that vehicle fuel will be available in all major outlets - Pakistan State Oil (PSO), Shell and Total stations across the country. A ministry spokesperson said that a summary to increase the profit margin of petroleum dealers has already been sent to the ECC, the Dawn report said. The ministry is working on increasing the margin and a federal cabinet would take a decision soon.Pakistan's economy is currently grappling with high inflation, current account deficit, historical currency devaluation and dwindling of foreign reserves. Amid the surging economical challenges, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has agreed to revive a stalled $6 billion funding program for Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistans-petroleum-dealers-to-launch-nationwide-strike-today-101637798580806.html
25-11-2021||World||Sweden's first female prime minister resigns hours after appointment||Hours after being tapped as Sweden’s first female prime minister, Magdalena Andersson resigned Wednesday after suffering a budget defeat in parliament and her coalition partner the Greens left the two-party minority government.The government’s own budget proposal was rejected in favor of one presented by the opposition that includes the right-wing populist Sweden Democrats. Sweden’s third-largest party is rooted in a neo-Nazi movement. The vote was 154-143 in favor of the opposition’s budget proposal.Andersson, leader of the Social Democratic party, decided it was best to step down from the post more than seven hours after she made history by becoming the first woman to lead the country.”For me, it is about respect, but I also do not want to lead a government where there may be grounds to question its legitimacy,” Andersson told a news conference.Andersson, who was finance minister before briefly becoming prime minister, informed parliamentary Speaker Andreas Norlen that she is still interested in leading a Social Democratic one-party government.Norlen, the speaker of Sweden’s 349-seat parliament, said he will contact Sweden’s eight party leaders ”to discuss the situation.” On Thursday, he will announce the road ahead.Andersson said that “a coalition government should resign if a party chooses to leave the government. Despite the fact that the parliamentary situation is unchanged, it needs to be tried again."Even though the Green Party pulled its support for her government, it said it is prepared to stand behind Andersson in a new vote to tap a prime minister.But the Greens said it was in the best interests of the party to pull support for her after the budget defeat in parliament.“We have a united party behind us saying we can not sit in government that implements a policy (the Sweden Democrats) negotiated. We must look our voters in the eye and feel pride,” said Marta Stenevi, Green Party spokesperson as the party chose to resign from the government.The other Green Party spokesperson Per Bolund said “that is something we deeply regret.”Earlier in the day, Andersson said she could “govern the country with the opposition’s budget.”The approved budget was based on the government’s own proposal but of the 74 billion kronor ($8.2 billion) that the government wanted to spend on reforms, just over 20 billion kronor ($2.2 billion) will be redistributed next year, Swedish broadcaster SVT said. The approved budget aims at reducing taxes, increased salaries for police officers and more money to different sectors of Sweden’s judiciary system.Andersson's appointment as prime minister had marked a milestone for Sweden, viewed for decades as one of Europe’s most progressive countries when it comes to gender relations, but which had yet to have a woman in the top political post.Andersson had been tapped to replace Stefan Lofven as party leader and prime minister, roles he relinquished earlier this year.Earlier in the day, 117 lawmakers voted yes to Andersson, 174 rejected her appointment while 57 abstained and one lawmaker was absent.Under the Swedish Constitution, prime ministers can be named and govern as long as a parliamentary majority — a minimum of 175 lawmakers — is not against them.Sweden’s next general election is scheduled for Sept. 11.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/swedens-first-female-prime-minister-resings-hours-after-appointment-101637797591070.html
25-11-2021||World||Respite for Biden as US layoff wave ebbs, spending ramps up||Americans are spending their way into the holiday season, while jobless claims have fallen to historic lows, new data showed Wednesday -- offering some respite for President Joe Biden as he steers the recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic amid soaring inflation.The raft of surveys paint a picture of a country where companies are increasingly holding on to staff while workers are channeling their paychecks to businesses across the world's largest economy, all while dealing with the uncertainty posed by rapid price increases.In a landmark for the labor market, new filings for jobless benefits last week dropped below their level before the pandemic struck, plunging to a low not hit since 1969, the government said.Meanwhile, spending and incomes both rose more than expected last month -- though prices also increased five percent compared to October 2020, their biggest jump since November 1990.Biden cheered the employment data, saying in a statement that it signaled a "historic jobs recovery" and that "more Americans are getting back to work, and more Americans have money in their pockets."Spending and incomes have also climbed above pre-pandemic levels thanks in part to massive spending measures enacted in Washington, Gregory Daco of Oxford Economics said."As we look forward to Thanksgiving, there is much to be thankful for in this fiscally-stimulated recovery," he said in a note, referring to the Thursday holiday."Still, the recovery process isn't complete, with spending on services well below its pre-pandemic trend, and the transition from public- to private-driven growth will be delicate."- 'Quirk' behind jobless drop - The US economy has come a long way since March 2020, when the beginning of what would become the world's largest Covid-19 outbreak caused more than 20 million people to lose their jobs.Weekly filings for unemployment benefits shot into the millions before leveling off for much of the year. Their retreat to levels nearer those seen before the pandemic only came in 2021, with the release of Covid-19 vaccines.The latest data from the Labor Department brings the closely watched metric of job market health back below where it was on the week of March 14, 2020 before the layoffs began.But analysts were suspicious. Claims decreased by 71,000 from the week prior and hit a level not seen for generations, which Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics attributed to a "seasonal adjustment quirk" that "will substantially reverse next week.""That said, the trend in claims is clearly falling," he wrote in an analysis.- Spending through inflation - Even as the economy has rebounded, Biden has seen his approval ratings fall in recent months, in part due to the spike in inflation.Personal consumption expenditures (PCE) data released by the Commerce Department outlined the extent of last month's increases, with energy prices up 30.2 percent from October 2020 while food prices were 4.8 percent higher.PCE is the preferred inflation gauge of the Federal Reserve, which has pledged to keep its interest rate at zero for longer to maximize employment as the economy recovers.Minutes from the most recent meeting of their policy-setting committee released Wednesday showed some officials worrying the price increases were accelerating, and urged swifter action to end the central bank's stimulus measures.Despite the inflation wave, the government data showed spending exceeded analysts' forecasts with a 1.3 percent gain, while incomes climbed by a more-than-expected 0.5 percent.The latter was due to increasing wages and gains from assets, the data showed, and undercut by the tapering of government benefit payments, likely due to the expiry of pandemic aid programs.Consumers directed their spending towards both goods and services, the report said.Much of the $123.8 billion increase in goods spending went to motor vehicles and parts, while international travel was a component of the $90.5 billion increase in services spending that was felt across sectors.Rubeela Farooqi of High Frequency Economics said the data were a good omen for overall growth in the last quarter of the year, but warned of "some risk from rising infections and broken supply chains that could be disruptive during the holiday season."The economy's recovery this year was dented in the third quarter by the Delta wave of Covid-19 infections, which again snarled businesses.On Wednesday, the Commerce Department revised its GDP growth forecast up slightly to 2.1 percent, annualized, but that remained well below the pace of 6.7 percent in the quarter before.cs/ia||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/respite-for-biden-as-us-layoff-wave-ebbs-spending-ramps-up-101637794452024.html
25-11-2021||World||'No progress' with Iran in nuclear talks: UN agency||The UN nuclear watchdog said Wednesday there had been "no progress" in talks with Tehran on disputes over the monitoring of Iran's atomic programme, just days before talks restart on reviving the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.Rafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), told a quarterly meeting of the agency's board that talks he held in Tehran on Tuesday were "inconclusive" despite being "constructive".Grossi had sought to tackle constraints put on IAEA inspections earlier this year, outstanding questions over the presence of undeclared nuclear material at sites in Iran, and the treatment of IAEA staff in the country."In terms of the substance... we were not able to make progress," Grossi told reporters, saying that the lack of agreement had come "in spite of my best efforts".Behrouz Kamalvandi, spokesman for the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, told Iranian television his team "tried until the last moment" but there is still work to be done.Among other officials in Tehran, Grossi met Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian.Amir-Abdollahian put a positive gloss on the talks, telling the official Irna agency on Wednesday that a "common declaration" had been reached which would be published "as soon as possible".'Foot-dragging'Grossi's visit came ahead of the scheduled resumption on Monday of negotiations between Tehran and world powers aimed at reviving the 2015 deal that gave Iran sanctions relief in return for curbs on its nuclear programme.The United States said it was "disappointed" by the outcome of Grossi's visit and said it was ready to negotiate in Vienna."But of course Iran's failure to cooperate is a bad sign about their seriousness in a successful conclusion to our negotiations," a State Department spokesperson said.The remaining members of the accord -- France, Germany, the UK, China, Russia and Iran -- will attend with the US taking part indirectly.The deal has been gradually disintegrating since former US President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from the deal in 2018.The following year Iran retaliated by starting to move away from its commitments under the deal, also known as the JCPOA.The US negotiator for the JCPOA talks Rob Malley warned that Washington would not "sit idly" if Iran delayed progress at the talks."If (Iran) continues to do what it appears to be doing now, which is to drag its feet at the nuclear diplomatic table and accelerate its pace when it comes to its nuclear program... we'll have to respond accordingly," Malley told US broadcaster NPR.At the IAEA Board of Governors' meeting, the EU issued a joint statement saying it was "deeply concerned at the inconclusive outcome of the discussions" with Grossi.Russia's representative meanwhile said it supported Grossi's "intent to continue working with the Iranian side and call for Tehran to do the same".'Excessively invasive'One of the steps away from the deal came earlier this year when Iran began restricting some IAEA inspections activity.Iran and the agency currently have a temporary agreement that gives the IAEA access to monitoring equipment at Iran's nuclear facilities.However, the Agency has warned that the agreement is not a durable solution and Grossi said he was "close to... the point where I would not be able to guarantee continuity of knowledge" of Iran's nuclear programme if it continued.Grossi also said he had raised concerns while in Tehran about security checks on IAEA inspectors which the agency has described as "excessively invasive".He noted that the IAEA and Iran had a legal agreement "which is intended to protect inspectors from intimidation, from seizure of their property"."Our Iranian colleagues have instituted a number of measures which are simply incompatible" with this, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-progress-with-iran-in-nuclear-talks-un-agency-101637794192876.html

I couldn't believe it.""I always was interested in space as a little girl," she added. "This is a great opportunity for me to feel alive and to just make the greatest adventure ever."Schahaff won the prize after entering a fundraiser sweepstakes organized by Virgin Galactic on the Omaze platform, which raised $1.7 million.The money will be donated to non-government group Space for Humanity, which works for wider access to space.The amount she donated was not made public, but entry started with a minimum contribution of $10.Schahaff, a health and energy coach who works in particular with women, decided to take a shot at the prize after seeing an advertisement on a Virgin Atlantic flight."I just filled out the application, did what was required... not realizing that I would have actually gotten a response to it," she said."I'm very encouraged to inspire others to also live their dream."The drive attracted nearly 165,000 participants in eight weeks, Virgin Galactic said in a statement.'Equal access to space' Wednesday's announcement aimed to show that space tourism is opening up opportunities for a variety of people, despite prices remaining well beyond the reach of most."Being able to give people of all ages and backgrounds equal access to space, and in turn, the opportunity to lead and inspire others back on Earth, is what Virgin Galactic has been building towards for the past two decades," said Branson.The British septuagenarian flew in his company's test mission to space in July, beating by a matter of days Blue Origin owner Jeff Bezos in their billionaire space race.Schahaff will be among the first of Virgin Galactic's space tourists, but her place in the line has yet to be determined, a company spokesperson said.Virgin Galactic has already pre-sold some 700 space tickets: 600 between 2005 and 2014 for up to $250,000 apiece, and another 100 since August, when they were relisted for a price of $450,000.Their aim is to sell 1,000 in total before the launch of commercial flights, the first of which is to take place in late 2022.The proposed trip offers a few minutes in zero gravity. A giant carrier plane takes off from a traditional runway carrying the space vessel, which looks like a large private jet, and then releases it at a high altitude.The space plane then ignites its own rocket engine until it exceeds 50 miles (80 kilometers) above sea level -- the lower limit of space, according to the US military -- before gliding back to the runway.Amazon founder Bezos's company Blue Origin is also offering suborbital flights, but aboard a rocket that takes off from the more traditional vertical position.Blue Origin's third crewed flight is scheduled for early December.Elon Musk's SpaceX meanwhile sent four tourists on a three-day orbital mission around the Earth in September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mom-daughter-bound-for-space-after-winning-virgin-galactic-prize-101637793882058.html

This comes after the government released a report in June, encompassing 144 observations, which said there was a lack of sufficient data to determine the nature of mysterious flying objects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dart-spacecraft-to-kick-an-asteroid-off-course-101637788530212.html

Sunday, in a televised appearance announcing he’d taken the injected booster, Putin said he would volunteer to participate in the testing of the nasal vaccine, as well.That option provides better protection in the upper respiratory tract against breakthrough infections than injected versions, Denis Logunov, deputy director of the Gamaleya National Research Center, Sputnik’s developer, told Putin.The Russian president, 69, said Logunov gave him the nasal version Monday. Putin told a government meeting that he’s “feeling fine” after the boosters and had exercised today.Russia claimed to be the first to approve a Covid vaccine in the summer of 2020, but officials and scientists began getting the shots even before Sputnik was registered. Putin, however, got his first two-dose inoculation only in March of this year.Vaccines reduce Delta transmission by 40%’Covid vaccines reduce transmission of the dominant Delta variant by about 40%, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday, warning that people were falling into a false sense of security.The WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus urged vaccinated people to continue to take measures to avoid catching Covid-19 and passing on the disease. He noted that last week, more than 60% of all reported cases and deaths from Covid-19 were once again in Europe.Italy on Wednesday said that unvaccinated people will not be able to enter venues such as cinemas, restaurants and sports events starting from December 6, at least until January 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-feeling-fine-after-taking-experimental-nasal-vaccine-101637788182523.html
25-11-2021||World||China undercounted the number of kids born by nearly 12mn||China undercounted the number of children born in 2000 to 2010 by at least 11.6 million - equivalent to Belgium’s current population - partly because of its stringent one-child policy.The latest statistical yearbook released by the government puts the number of children born during that period at 172.5 million, well above the 160.9 million in that age group recorded in the 2010 census.The difference could be the result of some parents failing to register births to avoid punishment if they breached the one-child policy. China only started allowing all couples to have a second child in 2016, meaning some parents wouldn’t officially report a newborn if they were over the quota until the child turned six and needed to register for school, according to independent demographer He Yafu.About 57% of the children later registered were girls, indicating the discrepancy could be partly linked to parents not reporting girls so they could continue to try for a boy.In addition, the 2010 census was conducted on November 1, 2010, so would have missed births in the last two months of the year. Census surveys also typically don’t include people who have died or emigrated in the intervening years.However, with China now effectively abandoning limits on family size, there could be less of a discrepancy in future.Nevertheless, the number of births is expected to continue declining in China, and the total population could start shrinking as early as this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-undercounted-the-number-of-kids-born-by-nearly-12mn-101637786995242.html

That comes as Germany is seeing a surge in cases, and the political transition has somewhat hampered the country’s response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-parties-reach-deal-for-new-govt-scholz-101637786557554.html
25-11-2021||World||At least 31 dead after migrant boat capsizes in English Channel||At least 31 migrants bound for Britain died Wednesday when their boat sank in the English Channel in the “biggest tragedy” involving migration to have taken place on the dangerous crossing to date, according to France's interior minister.Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said 34 people were believed to have been on the boat. Authorities found 31 bodies and two survivors. One person appeared to still be missing.A joint French-British operation to search for survivors was still under way Wednesday evening.While the incident was the deadliest day in the channel to date, Darmanin noted other deadly incidents in the past and lashed out at “criminal traffickers” driving thousands to risk the crossing.The nationalities of the travelers was not released.Britain's prime minister convened a meeting of the government's crisis committee, and France's interior minister rushed to see survivors in a Calais hospital. The two governments have long been at odds over how to prevent the increasingly dangerous migrant crossings, with both sides blaming the other for not doing enough.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was “shocked, appalled and deeply saddened."A French naval boat spotted several bodies in the water around 2 p.m. and retrieved an unknown number of dead and injured, including some who were unconscious, a maritime authority spokesperson said.Three French patrol boats were joined by a French helicopter and a British helicopter in searching the area, according to the French maritime agency for the region.Jean-Marc Puissesseau, head of the ports of Calais and Boulogne, told The Associated Press that he spoke to one of the rescuers who brought some of the bodies to the Calais port.“Traffickers are assassins,” he said. “We were waiting for something like this to happen.”While deaths are occasionally reported on the crossing, such a large number of people losing their lives in one boat is rare.The victims' nationalities were not immediately released. People fleeing conflict in Afghanistan, Iraq, Eritrea and Sudan have been among those gathered along towns in northern France seeking to cross to Britain.“Strong emotion after the drama of numerous dead in the sinking of a boat of migrants in the channel,” Darmanin tweeted. He slammed migrant smuggling networks that organize such journeys.The Dunkirk prosecutor’s office said it opened an investigation for aggravated manslaughter in the wake of the tragedy.The number of migrants using small boats to cross the channel has grown sharply this year, despite the high risks that are worsening in autumn weather. A number of people are also believed to have reached Britain in small boats on Wednesday.More than 25,700 people have made the dangerous journey in small boats this year — three times the total for the whole of 2020.With changeable weather, cold seas and heavy maritime traffic, the crossing is dangerous for the inflatables and other small boats that men, women and children squeeze into.French and British authorities have picked up thousands of migrants off both the French and British coasts in recent weeks in scores of rescue operations.“How many more times must we see people lose their life trying to reach safety in the UK because of the woeful lack of safe means to do so?" said Tom Davies, Amnesty International U.K.’s refugee and migrant rights campaign manager.“We desperately need a new approach to asylum, including genuine Anglo-French efforts to devise safe asylum routes to avoid such tragedies happening again," he added.Johnson said more needed to be done to “break the business model of the gangsters who are sending people to sea in this way."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/migrant-boat-capsizes-in-english-channel-at-least-31-dead-101637782032860.html
25-11-2021||World||Flush with cash, Saudi Prince snubs Biden and sends a message||President Joe Biden sounded deeply frustrated. Inflation was heading toward a 30-year high and Americans, rich and poor, could see the price of gasoline going up almost daily. Politically, oil was toxic for the White House.'The idea that Russia and Saudi Arabia and other major producers are not going to pump more oil so people can have gasoline to get to and from work, for example, is not right,' Biden said in late October.First in private and later more publicly, American envoys had spent weeks trying to convince the Saudis to pump more crude -- and quickly, according to officials on both sides. The diplomatic pressure was ultimately directed at a 36-year-old man who has the capacity to change the price of oil -- and the fortune of politicians in consuming nations -- on a whim: Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.But the kingdom’s day-to-day ruler didn't budge despite the overtures from American diplomats. Prince Mohammed was more worried about oil’s  supply and demand fundamentals than the political needs of Washington.  But if Biden wanted cheaper gasoline, the prince had his own wish list, including something he hasn’t yet got from the current White House -- access.Since taking office, Biden has only spoken with King Salman, Prince Mohammed’s father, and refused to deal directly with the crown prince, who’s still seen as a pariah in the U.S. after the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018.“There’s a lot of Middle Eastern folks who want to talk to me,” Biden said in October, without directly naming Prince Mohammed. “I’m not sure I’m going to talk to them.”Ultimately, Biden didn't get the extra oil he wanted, forcing him to respond on Tuesday by tapping the country's strategic petroleum reserve -- a decision that risks a further escalation from the Saudi-led OPEC cartel.For Prince Mohammed, sitting atop what’s sometimes described as the central bank of oil, soaring crude prices are giving him the confidence to demand the attention of Biden, and everyone else. The influx of cash also helps his plan to make the kingdom a global investment powerhouse through the $450 billion Public Investment Fund, the sovereign wealth fund which he also chairs and wants to grow to $1 trillion by 2025. In early 2020, Saudi Arabia was staring into the abyss. The pandemic led to a crash in oil prices forcing it to hike taxes and boost its borrowing. Now, just over a year later, oil prices and Saudi crude production are booming, helping restore the kingdom’s finances with a wave of petrodollars, replenishing state coffers, and boosting the prince’s standing at home.“Saudi Arabia is in a strong position,” said Jason Bordoff, dean of the Columbia Climate School and a former senior White House energy official under President Barack Obama. “Oil demand is going up, not down; U.S. shale is not what used to be, and for the foreseeable future the world is going to need more Saudi oil.”In interviews with former and current western and Arab government officials, diplomats, consultants, bankers and oil executives, a picture emerges: Riyadh is coming out of the Covid crisis stronger, both politically and economically. The officials agreed to speak only under condition of anonymity to discuss private interchanges.The Saudi resurgence is linked to the world’s thirst for fossil fuels. Despite the fight against climate change, the world economy is as addicted to oil as it was before the pandemic. Global consumption is now back to about 100 million barrels a day, a level last seen in 2019. Despite the release of strategic reserves on Tuesday, Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, has climbed back above $80 a barrel and Saudi oil production will hit 10 million barrels a day next month, well above pre-Covid levels. If oil prices and Saudi output stay at current levels, the kingdom’s gross oil revenues will top $300 billion in 2022, according to Bloomberg News estimates – putting Riyadh on track to enjoy one of its best ever years. It could be even better. The International Energy Agency believes Saudi oil production may average 10.7 million barrels a day in 2022, the highest ever annual average.Higher oil prices have “strengthened Saudi Arabia’s position both financially and politically,” said David Rundell, a former U.S. diplomat with decades of experience in the kingdom. “Mohammed Bin Salman’s position will become even more secure.”Only a few years ago, the situation was very different.The prince rose to power after his father King Salman was enthroned in January 2015. Initially as Deputy Crown Prince, and since 2017 as Crown Prince, he inherited a sclerotic economy in a financial mess.And America was the reason for lots of the Saudi problems. With the support of Wall Street, the U.S. shale boom had transformed oil’s balance of power. Texas, and not Riyadh, was in the driving seat of the energy market.Months before Prince Mohammed rose to power, oil prices crashed under the weight of booming U.S. production. Brent crude plunged from $115 a barrel in June 2014 to $45 a barrel by the time that he’d followed his father into the royal palace in January 2015, and ultimately less than $30 a barrel by early 2016. Saudi Arabia was bleeding money.Prince Mohammed reacted by cutting spending and launching Vision 2030, a program to restructure the Saudi economy. For a while, Saudi fortunes improved as prices recovered in 2017 and 2018. It helped that Prince Mohammed opened up the formerly closeted economy and removed bans on cinemas and women driving, injecting more of the 21st century into Saudi society. But Khashoggi’s death in October 2018 burst the bubble of optimism. A U.S. intelligence report released by the Biden administration concluded that Prince Mohammed probably ordered the killing, a charge Saudi Arabia denies.After being feted by Western leaders and the heads of some of the world’s biggest firms, Prince Mohammed was quickly dropped. Then, oil prices tanked in early 2020 after Covid first struck China and then the world. Saudi Arabia only survived those bad years by running down its stock of petrodollars and borrowing billions to finance widening fiscal deficits. The reserves fell from a peak of nearly $750 billion in mid-2014 to a low of $437 billion earlier this year. Since, it’s recovered to $465 billion.With oil production and prices rising, the outlook has quickly improved. The royal palace planned for a budget deficit of 140 billion riyals ($37 billion) in 2021, but at the end of the third quarter, the shortfall was a mere 5.4 billion riyals, raising the prospect of balancing the books well ahead of a 2023 target. The Finance Ministry declined to comment on whether it expected to balance the budget this year, as some analysts now expect. “Our economic diversification initiatives are continuing and will be expedited with more resources available,” a spokesman said in a statement. Spending targets and taxation rates won’t change, but any surpluses will either repay debt or get transferred to one of the kingdom’s sovereign wealth funds.The influx of petrodollars will help Prince Mohammed to spend at home handsomely. The government and sovereign wealth fund, which the prince also chairs, have outlined trillions of dollars of spending on everything from vast new cities in the desert to upgrading the kingdom’s creaking infrastructure in a bid to make it a finance, trade and logistics hub for the Middle East.“Higher oil prices are good for the economy, but not in the old way,” said Mazen Al Sudairy, head of research at AlRajhi Capital. In the past, higher oil prices helped the Saudi government fund things like hiring sprees of civil servants to keep unemployment down. Now a surplus is less likely to go into “sticky” spending measures and instead focus on enhancing reserves.In a bid to put the kingdom, and himself, at the center of regional politics, over the past year he’s also patched up a dispute with Qatar and made overtures to arch enemy Iran. In addition to seeking recognition from Biden, the Prince also wants more U.S. help ending the long and expensive war in Yemen. He’d also like more military support to defend itself from drone attacks like the one that knocked out half its oil processing capabilities in 2019.For all the improvement, the Saudi economy is still heavily reliant on oil. Vision 2030 has made so far only modest progress, and critics believe that many of Prince Mohammed’s pet projects, including an entirely new city in the desert called Neom, are white elephants that consume billions of dollars but return little. If the oil market takes a turn for the worse, perhaps because new flare ups of coronavirus cases, Riyadh would be in financial trouble again.For the time being, however, Saudi Arabia appears to be safe. Its oil alliance with Russia looks stronger than ever, putting Riyadh firmly in control of the market, in part thanks to the guidance of Prince Mohammed’s half-brother, Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman. “The Saudis feel they are on the driving seat of the oil market,” says said Helima Croft, commodities strategist at RBC Capital Markets LLC and a former CIA analyst.Over the last few months, OPEC has actually increased output as demand recovers. But Riyadh has made sure the cartel boosted production more slowly than demand recovered, in the process draining global inventories, and lifting prices.Inventories of crude and refined oil product in industrialized countries have fallen now below 2.8 billion barrels, hitting their lowest level since early 2015. “The world oil market remains tight by all measures,” the agency said in November.Still, Biden has continued to refuse to speak to the Crown Prince, widely known as MBS, despite his desire for lower oil prices to bring down inflation. The refusal has continued even after Saudi Arabia announced its most ambitious green target ever, saying it will reach net-zero emissions by 2060.“Whatever the U.S. is offering MBS in return, it is just not enough to persuade him to pump more oil,” said Neil Quilliam, associate fellow in the Middle East and North Africa program at the London-based think tank Chatham House. “The U.S. has to offer something big to get the Saudis to change course - and that must include a bilateral meeting between Biden and MBS.”But Prince Mohammed hasn’t just rebuffed its American ally. Riyadh has argued that OPEC is already adding enough crude into the market, in the process rejecting pleas from China, India and Japan for more oil. President Biden and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, discussed the problem in November during a virtual summit, and agreed to work together to stabilize energy markets.The following week the U.S. was joined by Japan, India, South Korea and the U.K. in a coordinated release of reserves. China is expected to follow suit.Saudi officials paint a different version of the energy landscape. While the oil market is tight today, it will loosen significantly from January onward. They argue higher prices are driven by market fundamentals and the biggest shortage is for natural gas and coal. “Oil is not the problem,” Prince Abdulaziz, the energy minister, said after the last OPEC virtual meeting in November. “The problem is the energy complex is going through havoc and hell.”Prince Abdulaziz will chair an OPEC virtual meeting next week, which will deliver the cartel’s response to Biden’s use of the strategic petroleum reserve. A lot will depend on whether oil keeps rising beyond $80 a barrel, but OPEC can counteract the release by delaying further output hikes.In October, the who’s who of global finance gathered at the Ritz Carlton hotel in Riyadh, granting Prince Mohammed a standing ovation. It was the very same hotel that Saudi authorities turned four years ago into a makeshift prison when it launched what it described as an anti corruption drive that ensnared some of the country’s wealthiest people. The investment summit, which promotes the Saudi wealth fund as a global dealmaker, comes at a time when Riyadh is recycling its newly found oil wealth into trophy assets overseas. The PIF, as the fund is known, recently bought Newcastle United, the British Premier League soccer club. The takeover helps to re-brand the kingdom’s austere image as it aims to attract foreign investment and tourists. Earlier this year it took a stake in supercar maker McLaren and secured a deal to bring Formula 1 to the country.“MBS needs to use today’s bonanza to secure Saudi Arabia’s economic future by moving as fast as possible into non-oil economic sectors,” said Jim Krane, research fellow at Rice University’s Baker Institute. “When the oil rents pour in, it’s easy to buy extra political support,” making the investments the kingdom needs to make to get ahead of “a damaging energy transition,” Krane said.Surviving that transition “is going to be the Saudi mantra,” he said. “High oil prices are just the ticket to get this process rolling.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/flush-with-cash-saudi-prince-snubs-biden-and-sends-a-message-101637760596116.html
25-11-2021||World||700,000 more could die in Europe: WHO on Covid-19||Europe remains “in the firm grip” of Covid and the death toll on the continent could top 2.2mn this winter if current trends continue, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday.Some 700,000 could die in the coming months, the WHO said, as cases creep up across Europe, prompting some countries to reimpose tough restrictions.The WHO expects “high or extreme stress in intensive care units (ICUs) in 49 out of 53 countries between now and March 1, 2022”. “Cumulative reported deaths are projected to reach over 2.2mn by spring next year,” it added, up from the current 1.5mn. According to WHO data, Covid-related deaths increased last week to nearly 4,200 a day, doubling from 2,100 deaths a day at the end of September.The WHO also said evidence was growing that vaccine-induced protection against infection and mild disease was declining. “The Covid-19 situation across Europe and Central Asia is very serious. We face a challenging winter ahead,” regional director for WHO Europe, Hans Kluge, said in a statement.He called for a “vaccine plus” approach, consisting of vaccinations, social distancing, the use of face masks and hand washing.Call for more Covid-19 restrictions in GermanyGermany’s health minister called on Tuesday for further restrictions to contain a “dramatic” surge in coronavirus cases as the country’s infection rate hit a record high and the US advised against travel there.The seven-day incidence rate - the number of people per 100,000 to be infected over the last week - hit 399.8 on Tuesday, up from 386.5 on Monday, data from the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases showed.Health minister Jens Spahn called for more public spaces to be restricted to those who were vaccinated or recently recovered from Covid-19 and also had a negative test, in a bid to contain Germany’s fourth wave.Spahn did not rule out lockdowns, although he said this would be decided region by region. Some regions such as the hard-hit Saxony and Bavaria are already taking measures such as cancelling Christmas markets.“The situation is not only serious, in some regions in Germany it is now dramatic,” Spahn told German Radio. “We are having to move patients around as the intensive care units are full and that doesn’t just affect Covid-19 patients.”The surge in cases in Germany, and in neighbouring Denmark, prompted the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Monday to advise against travel to the two countries, raising its travel recommendation to “Level Four: Very High”.The Netherlands on Tuesday started transporting Covid patients across the border to Germany to ease pressure on Dutch hospitals struggling to deal with a surge in coronavirus cases. The number of patients in Dutch hospitals has swelled to its highest level since May in recent weeks .French PM tests positiveFrench Prime Minister Jean Castex tested positive for Covid-19 and will be isolating for 10 days, his office said in a statement.Although France has not put new restrictions in place like Austria and Germany, the latest wave is hitting the country “at a blazing speed”, government spokesman Gabriel Attal said on Sunday.President Emmanuel Macron’s government is reinforcing healthpass checks in enclosed areas and this week will discuss opening up its booster-shot campaign to more adults, he said. In Belgium, Prime Minister Alexander De Croo and several other ministers went into quarantine on Monday after meeting with French PM Castex earlier in the day.The Czech Republic may make Covid-19 vaccines mandatory for people over the age of 60 as well as for some professions including health and social care workers, under plans now being drawn up, Prime Minister Andrej Babis said on Tuesday.Austria on Monday went into a new lockdown while Slovakia’s leaders have proposed a national lockdown as hospitals across the European Union country are hitting their limits amid a record surge of coronavirus infections.The European Medicines Agency said it has received a request from Merck to authorise its coronavirus antiviral, the first pill shown to treat Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/700000-more-could-die-in-europe-who-on-covid19-101637706577111.html

She was 56.Shabazz was found Monday in her home in Brooklyn, a police spokesperson said. Her death appeared to be from natural causes, he said.Malikah and her twin sister, Malaak, were the youngest daughters of Malcolm X, who was assassinated on February 21, 1965. Their mother, Betty Shabazz, was pregnant with the twins when their father was killed.Shabazz and her daughter, Bettih Shabazz, were arrested in Maryland in 2017 on animal cruelty charges after authorities said several injured dogs were found inside a stolen U-Haul truck they were driving.Malikah Shabazz's death comes days after two of the three men who had been convicted of killing Malcolm X were exonerated.A Manhattan judge dismissed the convictions of Muhammad Aziz and the late Khalil Islam after prosecutors and the men's lawyers said a renewed investigation found new evidence that undermined the case against them.Bernice King, a daughter of Martin Luther King Jr., said on Twitter, “I'm deeply saddened by the death of #MalikahShabazz. My heart goes out to her family, the descendants of Dr. Betty Shabazz and Malcolm X.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/malikah-shabazz-a-daughter-of-slain-civil-rights-leader-malcolm-x-dies-at-56-101637677305127.html
25-11-2021||World||Stop ‘politicisation’ of tennis star Peng Shuai’s situation: China||The Chinese foreign ministry on Tuesday said it hoped that “malicious hype” about tennis star Peng Shuai’s whereabouts and well-being would stop and that her case would not be politicised.In its first reaction in the case, ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian said “certain people” should stop the “malicious hype” and “politicisation” of the issue of tennis star Peng, as global scrutiny led by foreign governments and sports and rights organisations continue to raise questions around her well-being.The whereabouts of Peng, a former doubles world number one and one of China’s top tennis icons, have been a matter of international concern since November 2 when she posted a message on social media alleging that China’s former vice-premier Zhang Gaoli had sexually assaulted her. Peng’s post was immediately deleted and her presence scrubbed from China’s strictly censored web.The Chinese foreign ministry had until now refused to comment on the case, saying it wasn’t a diplomatic issue.Zhao on Tuesday responded for the first time, dismissing international concern over Peng’s whereabouts as hype and politics.“I believe everyone has also seen her attend some public events recently as well as the video call with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) President (Thomas) Bach,” Zhao said at the regular ministry briefing on Tuesday.When asked whether the tennis player’s case would negatively affect China’s image, Zhao said, “I think some people should stop the malicious hype and not politicise this issue”.Earlier this week, International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach spoke with Peng via video call, her first direct contact with sports officials outside China since November 2.The Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) and Amnesty International said the call did not alleviate fears around Peng’s safety.“This video does not change our call for a full, fair and transparent investigation, without censorship, into her allegation of sexual assault, which is the issue that gave rise to our initial concern,” the WTA said.“The IOC is entering dangerous waters. They should be extremely careful not to participate in any whitewash of possible human rights violations,” said Amnesty’s China researcher Alkan Akad.“In the past we have seen various similar cases where people had no option but to say what they had been told to,” he said.“The Chinese government has a track record, especially the state run media outlets of fabricating statements or making people give forced and sometimes televised testimonies shortly after people go missing,” said Akad.On Sunday, Chinese state media released a video and photos of Peng at a youth tournament in Beijing.The footage was released by Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of state-run newspaper the Global Times, who said on Twitter that the video was shot on Sunday.Peng was shown standing beside a court and then waving and signing oversize commemorative tennis balls for children.“While it is positive to see her, it remains unclear if she is free and able to make decisions and take actions on her own, without coercion or external interference,” Steve Simon, WTA chief, said in response to the footage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/stop-politicisation-of-tennis-star-peng-shuai-s-situation-china-101637672999495.html

Officials at the prime minister's headquarters did not comment on whether Castex has any virus symptoms.One of Castex's daughters tested positive Monday after her father returned from a meeting with Belgian Prime Minister Alexander de Croo in Brussels, and Castex himself then took two tests that were both positive, his office said.De Croo's office said he will be tested Tuesday and will self-isolate while awaiting the result, according to Belgian state broadcaster RTBF.While 75% of France's population is vaccinated, the number of virus infections has risen quickly in recent weeks. Hospitalizations and deaths linked to the virus are also rising in France, though are so far well below the crisis levels of earlier surges.French President Emmanuel Macron contracted Covid-19 last December, and other government ministers have also had the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-pm-castex-tests-positive-for-covid-19-after-returning-from-belgium-101637625247308.html
25-11-2021||World||BTS become first Asian group to win Artist of the Year at the AMAs||South Korean pop sensation BTS became the first Asian group to win Artist of the Year at the American Music Awards on Sunday, brushing aside challenges from heayweights Taylor Swift, Drake and The Weeknd, as they took home a total of three awards just four years after making their first appearance on the fan-voted show..The seven-member boy band, consisting Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook, also scooped awards for Favorite Pop Duo or Group and Favorite Pop Song for their hit “Butter” at the glitzy ceremony, which aired live from the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles on Sunday night, hosted by rapper Cardi B.The band, known for its positive uplifting music, called the artist of the year win a miracle. “Seven boys from Korea, united by love for music, met the love and support from all the armies all over the world,” said BTS’ RM. “This whole thing is a miracle. Seriously, we would never take this for granted.”BTS closed the show with a performance of “Butter” and earlier joined Coldplay on stage for a rendition of their single “My Universe,” marking a post-pandemic return to live performances for the K-pop band.The show celebrated the best popular music for a second pandemic year with a mix of live and pre-taped performances.

25-11-2021||World||First known Covid case may have been a Wuhan market vendor: Study||The first identified Covid-19 case was a vendor at a seafood market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan and not, as thought earlier, an accountant without any link to the market, a new study published in the journal Science, said on Thursday.The origins of the Sars-CoV-2 virus, which causes Covid-19 remains a mystery, and a major source of tension between China and several western countries.The identification of the accountant as the first patient with Covid-19 symptoms had added to the speculation that the virus could have leaked from a virus laboratory located across the Yangtze river from the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, the first pandemic epicentre.Beijing has consistently denied the lab leak theory, and claiming instead that cases of the viral fever had been diagnosed in other countries before Wuhan. The new study adds to the voices suggesting that the virus may have emerged from an animal. It says that the World Health Organization and China inquiry into the origins had got the initial chronology of the outbreak wrong.According to virologist Michael Worobey, rather than the original patient being a man who had never been to the Wuhan market, the first known case of Covid-19 turns out to be a woman, a vendor at the market.“His (the accountant’s) symptom onset came after multiple cases in workers at Huanan market, making a female seafood vendor there the earliest known case, with illness onset on December 11,” said Worobey, who is head of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Arizona.“Given the high transmissibility of Sars-CoV-2 and the high rate of asymptomatic spread, many symptomatic cases would inevitably soon lack a direct link to the location of the pandemic’s origin,” he wrote. The virologist went through publicly available data including hospital records and interviews of patients to arrive at this conclusion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-known-covid-case-may-have-been-a-wuhan-market-vendor-study-101637357286125.html
25-11-2021||World||Kenosha shootings: Kyle Rittenhouse, teenager who shot 2, cleared of all charges||Kyle Rittenhouse was acquitted of all charges Friday after pleading self-defense in the deadly Kenosha shootings that became a flashpoint in the debate over guns, vigilantism and racial injustice in the U.S.Rittenhouse, 18, began to choke up, fell to the floor and then hugged one of his attorneys upon hearing the verdict.He had been charged with homicide, attempted homicide and reckless endangering after killing two men and wounding a third with an AR-style semi-automatic rifle during a tumultuous night of protests over police violence against Black people in the summer of 2020. The former police youth cadet is white, as were those he shot.The jury, which appeared to be overwhelmingly white, deliberated for close to 3 1/2 days.Rittenhouse could have gotten life in prison if found guilty on the most serious charge, first-degree intentional homicide, or what some other states call first-degree murder.As he dismissed the jurors, Circuit Judge Bruce Schroeder assured them the court would take “every measure” to keep them safe.A sheriff’s deputy immediately whisked Rittenhouse out a back door through the judge’s chambers.In reaction to the verdict, prosecutor Thomas Binger said the jury had spoken.Rittenhouse's mother, sitting several feet away from him on a courtroom bench, gasped in delight and began crying as the clerk read out the string of five not-guilty verdicts, hugging others around her.Wisconsin Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, who is Black and a Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate, denounced the outcome.“Over the last few weeks, many dreaded the outcome we just witnessed," Barnes said. "The presumption of innocence until proven guilty is what we should expect from our judicial system, but that standard is not always applied equally. We have seen so many black and brown youth killed, only to be put on trial posthumously, while the innocence of Kyle Rittenhouse was virtually demanded by the judge.”Political figures on the right, meanwhile, welcomed the verdict and condemned the case brought against Rittenhouse.“All of us who knew what actually happened in Kenosha last year assumed this would be the verdict,” tweeted Republican former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. “Thankfully, the jury thought the same.”As the outcome drew near, Gov. Tony Evers pleaded for calm and said 500 National Guard members would be ready for duty in Kenosha if needed.Rittenhouse was 17 when he went from his home in Antioch, Illinois, to Kenosha after businesses in the city were ransacked and burned over the shooting of a Black man, Jacob Blake, by a white police officer.Carrying a weapon that authorities said was illegally purchased for the underage Rittenhouse, he joined other armed citizens in what he said was an effort to protect property and provide medical aid.Bystander and drone video captured most of the frenzied chain of events that followed: Rittenhouse killed Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, then shot to death protester Anthony Huber, 26, and wounded demonstrator Gaige Grosskreutz, now 28.Prosecutors portrayed Rittenhouse as a “wannabe soldier” who had gone looking for trouble that night and was responsible for creating a dangerous situation in the first place by pointing his rifle at demonstrators.But Rittenhouse testified: “I didn’t do anything wrong. I defended myself.”Breaking into sobs at one point, he told the jury he opened fire after Rosenbaum chased him and made a grab for his gun. He said he was afraid his rifle was going to be wrested away and used to kill him.Huber was then killed after hitting Rittenhouse in the head or neck with a skateboard, and Grosskreutz was shot after pointing a gun of his own at Rittenhouse.The case was part of an extraordinary confluence of trials that reflected the deep divide over race in the United States: In Georgia, three white men are on trial in the killing of Ahmaud Arbery, while in Virginia, a trial is underway in a lawsuit over the deadly white-supremacist rally held in Charlottesville in 2017.The exact racial makeup of the Rittenhouse jury wasn’t clear because jurors were not asked about their race in court.The bloodshed in Kenosha took place during a summer of sometimes-violent protests set off across the U.S. by the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis and other cases involving the police use of force against Black people.While some Americans condemned Rittenhouse as a vigilante, some on the right hailed him as a hero who exercised his Second Amendment gun rights and tried to put a stop to lawlessness.Then-President Donald Trump said it appeared Rittenhouse had been “very violently attacked.” Supporters donated more than $2 million toward his legal defense.Rittenhouse had also been charged with possession of a dangerous weapon by a person under 18, a misdemeanor that had appeared likely to lead to a conviction. But the judge threw out that charge before jury deliberations after the defense argued that the Wisconsin law did not apply to the long-barreled rifle used by Rittenhouse.Schroeder’s handling of the trial drew attention at several points, including when he led applause for military veterans on Veterans Day just before a defense witness who had been in the Army was about to take the stand. The judge also let Rittenhouse himself draw juror numbers from a raffle drum to set the final 12 who deliberated.Video and testimony from some of the prosecution’s own witnesses seemed to buttress Rittenhouse’s claim of self-defense.Witnesses described Rosenbaum as “hyperaggressive” and said that he dared others to shoot him and threatened to kill Rittenhouse earlier that night. A videographer testified Rosenbaum lunged for the rifle just before he was shot, and a pathologist said his injuries appeared to indicate his hand was over the barrel.Also, Rosenbaum’s fiancee disclosed that he was on medication for bipolar disorder and depression. Rittenhouse’s lawyers branded Rosenbaum a “crazy person.”Some civil rights activists saw a racial double standard in the way the white gunman was treated.On the night of the shootings, law enforcement officers saw Rittenhouse and other armed people on the streets despite a curfew and gave them bottles of water, with one officer heard saying over a loudspeaker, “We appreciate you guys.”Later, amid the tumult, Rittenhouse managed to get past a police line with his weapon slung over his shoulder and was not arrested that night.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kenosha-shootings-kyle-rittenhouse-teenager-who-shot-2-cleared-of-all-charges-101637346378259.html
25-11-2021||World||Kamala Harris becomes first female acting president of the US||Vice-President Kamala Harris on Friday became the first female acting president of the United States after President Joe Biden temporarily transferred his presidential powers to her before going for an annual medical check-up, which involves possible sedation.Harris is the first woman to hold presidential powers. Though temporary and notional, this will be yet another first for Harris who already has a bagful of them. She was the first woman vice-president, and as the daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants, she was also the first African American vice-president, first Asian American vice-president, and the first Indian American to hold the country’s second-most powerful position.The White House press office has confirmed that President Joe Biden is using Section 3 of the 25th Amendment to temporarily transfer power.The 25th Amendment, which was enacted in the aftermath of president John F Kennedy’s assassination, lays down the process by which a president or vice-president can be replaced in the event of death, removal, resignation, or incapacitation.“Whenever the President transmits to the President pro-tempore of the Senate (the vice-president) and the Speaker of the House of Representatives his written declaration that he is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, and until he transmits to them a written declaration to the contrary, such powers and duties shall be discharged by the Vice President as Acting President,” the section says.Biden will take back his powers through a similar declaration.US presidents have handed over their powers before, under the 25th Amendment, ahead of a medical procedure such as a colonoscopy, which is conducted for colon cancer screening. Most people feel more comfortable going through the procedure under sedation, which is optional.Former President Donald Trump was an exception. He refused to be sedated for his colonoscopy in 2019, according to a new book by his then press secretary Stephanie Grisham, which means he did not have to transfer his presidential powers to then vice-president Mike Pence.Trump’s procedure was conducted at the Walter Reed military hospital and his visit was kept a secret. Grisham says Trump was embarrassed about the procedure. “I think the president was embarrassed by the procedure, even though President George W Bush had the same one done when he was in office and had been very transparent about it,” she wrote.Bush underwent colonoscopy twice — in 2002 and 2007 — and on both occasions he transferred his powers to then vice--president Dick Cheney for a couple of hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-becomes-first-female-acting-president-of-the-us-101637342951122.html
