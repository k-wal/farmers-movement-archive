The International Court of Justice (Review and Re-consideration) Act of 2021 is on the same lines as an ordinance issued last year by the Pakistan government to facilitate Jadhav’s right to appeal against the death sentence given to him for alleged involvement in espionage and subversive activities. Experts said the law would not make a material difference to the case of Jadhav and was more about meeting legal requirements so that he could mount a proper appeal in Pakistani courts. The law allows a foreign national to file a petition in a Pakistani high court for review and reconsideration of a conviction or sentence given by a military court. It was one of several bills passed during a joint session of Parliament in Islamabad that saw a walk-out by opposition lawmakers. The opposition was particularly angered by amendments to the Election Act of 2017 to allow the use of electronic voting machines and to give voting rights to overseas Pakistanis. The opposition MPs tore up official papers and shouted slogans against Prime Minister Imran Khan and his government. Pakistan’s law minister Farogh Naseem moved the bill to give effect to the International Court of Justice (ICJ)’s 2019 judgement seeking a review and reconsideration of the death sentence given to Jadhav. The government decided to introduce the bill at the joint session of Parliament as it was passed by the National Assembly or lower house in June this year, but was not passed by the Senate or upper house within the mandatory period of 90 days. After India approached the ICJ, the court said in its judgement that “Pakistan is under an obligation to provide, by means of its own choosing, effective review and reconsideration of the conviction and sentence of Mr Jadhav” in view of the violation of his rights under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. Jadhav was arrested in March 2016 in Balochistan on charges of spying and sentenced to death the following year. India rejected the charges levelled against the former navy officer and said he was kidnapped by Pakistani operatives from the Iranian port of Chabahar, where he was running a business. The ICJ stayed Jadhav’s execution in 2018. India also asked Pakistan in June to remove shortcomings in International Court of Justice (Review and Re-consideration) Act, saying it does not create a machinery to facilitate effective review and reconsideration of Jadhav’s case as mandated by the ICJ.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-passes-bill-to-help-kulbhushan-jadhav-appeal-against-death-sentence-101637162336675.html

A Taliban official said security forces were still gathering information.Images posted on social media showed a car destroyed by flames as well as twisted wreckage.The explosions added to a series of blasts to hit Kabul in recent days, with Shi'ite areas in the west of the city targeted several times.There was no claim of responsibility but Islamic State militants have claimed several attacks on Shi'ite targets including mosques.Mohammad Nabi, a resident of Dashti Barchi, said it appeared that the second explosion had also caused casualties but there were no immediate details.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-least-6-injured-as-two-blasts-hit-afghan-capital-kabul-officials-101637153920756.html
17-11-2021||World||Amid border row with India, China says military preparing for ‘next stage’||The Chinese military has conducted “major operations related to border defence” and strengthened training under combat conditions to build a modern armed force, the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) has said in a key resolution released on Tuesday.The resolution, only the third such one to be adopted in 100 years, on the CPC’s “achievements and historical experiences” also admitted that the party’s leadership over the military was “obviously lacking” for a period of time but has “made a fundamental turn for the better”.The resolution was passed at the end of a four-day, closed-door meeting of the CPC’s central committee held in Beijing last week.In what could be interpreted as a message to adversaries, the resolution said: “Devoting intense focus to combat effectiveness as the sole criterion that matters most and to their fundamental purpose of being able to fight and win, the people’s armed forces have strengthened their strategic forces and new-domain forces with new combat capabilities, and they have improved command systems and capacity for joint operations.”Defence mobilisation has been improved and “greater unity” has been cultivated between the military and the government and between the military and civilians, it said.The strong support for the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) transformation in the key document comes in the backdrop of the ongoing standoff with the Indian military along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.The document didn’t mention India but gave an indication of the PLA’s preparation for wars along its land and maritime borders.“They (the military) have conducted major operations related to border defence, protecting China’s maritime rights, countering terrorism and maintaining stability, disaster rescue and relief, fighting Covid-19, peacekeeping and escort services, humanitarian assistance, and international military cooperation,” the document said.“They have worked hard to address ‘peacetime ills’, vigorously strengthened training under combat conditions, and built strong, well-structured, and modern border defence, coastal defence, and air defence systems,” it added.China currently has land border disputes with India and Bhutan and maritime disputes with several neighbours over conflicting claims in the South China Sea and with Japan in the East China Sea.Troop training and battle preparedness have been bolstered across the board, the document said, adding that the military has accelerated efforts to modernise “…military theory, organisation, personnel, and weaponry and equipment and to integrate mechanisation with the application of information and smart technologies within the military”.The CPC under the presidency of Xi Jinping, who is also chairperson of the Central Military Commission (CMC), has reversed the trend of the CPC’s weakening control of China’s vast armed forces, the resolution indicated.“For a period of time, the party’s leadership over the military was obviously lacking. If this problem had not been completely solved, it would not only have diminished the military’s combat capacity, but also undermined the key political principle that the party commands the gun.”The resolution named four top generals - Guo Boxiong, Xu Caihou, Fang Fenghui, and Zhang Yang - who have been punished for corruption during Xi’s ongoing reign.They were “…thoroughly investigated and punished, and their negative influence was completely eliminated. With this, the political environment in the people’s armed forces has made a fundamental turn for the better”.“…the people’s military has been through an all-around revolutionary restructuring under the firm leadership of the party in preparation for the next stage, while our defence capabilities have grown in step with our economic strength.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-border-row-with-india-china-says-military-preparing-for-next-stage-101637147798613.html
17-11-2021||World||Taliban asks US to release Afghan assets; says economic turmoil brewing at home||The Taliban called Wednesday on US Congress members to release Afghan assets frozen after their takeover of the country, warning economic turmoil at home could lead to trouble abroad.In an open letter, Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi said the biggest challenge facing Afghanistan was financial insecurity, "and the roots of this concern lead back to the freezing of assets of our people by the American government".Washington has seized nearly $9.5 billion in assets belonging to the Afghan central bank, and the aid-dependent economy has effectively collapsed -- with civil servants unpaid for months and the treasury unable to pay for imports.Concerned nations have pledged hundreds of millions of dollars in aid, but are reluctant to commit funds unless the Taliban agree to a more inclusive government and to guarantee the rights of women and minorities."I present to you our compliments and would like to share a few thoughts on our bilateral relations," Muttaqi wrote, noting that 2021 was the centenary of Washington recognising Afghanistan's sovereignty.In measured understatement, he added: "Akin to other world countries, our bilateral relations have also experienced ups and downs."'Mass migration' threatMuttaqi said Afghanistan was enjoying stable government for the first time in over 40 years -- a period that started with an invasion by the Soviet Union in 1979 and ended with the withdrawal of the last US troops on August 31.From 1996 to 2001, the Taliban ruled Afghanistan with an iron fist, brutally violating human rights in the name of Islamic law, sparking fears of a return of their abuses.The Taliban have since returning to power gone to great lengths to convince the international community that they intend to do things differently this time -- though no female ministers have been named, and girls are still barred from returning to secondary school."Practical steps have been taken towards good governance, security and transparency," Muttaqi wrote."No threat is posed to the region or world from Afghanistan and a pathway has been paved for positive cooperation."Muttaqi said Afghans "understand the concerns of the international community", but that it was necessary for all sides to take positive steps to build trust.He warned, however, that the economic situation could spark a mass exodus."If the current situation prevails, the Afghan government and people will face problems and will become a cause for mass migration in the region and world which will consequently create further humanitarian and economic issues," he said.Muttaqi said the United States risked further damaging its reputation in the country "and this will serve as the worst memory ingrained in Afghans at the hands of America"."We hope that the members of the American Congress will think thoroughly in this regard," he added."I request... so that doors for future relations are opened, assets of Afghanistan's Central Bank are unfrozen and sanctions on our banks are lifted."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-asks-us-to-release-afghan-assets-says-economic-turmoil-brewing-at-home-101637145730344.html
17-11-2021||World||Coronavirus digest: Unvaccinated banned from some German Christmas markets||Hamburg has introduced tougher restrictions and Munich's Christkindlmarkt has been ditched altogether. Meanwhile, Germany has recorded its highest ever daily caseload. For the first time in two years, Germans will hit the Christmas markets on Wednesday, but millions will have to sit this one out due to a number of cities demanding proof of vaccination if people want to enjoy the festivities to the full.With Germany recording its highest ever daily caseload on Wednesday, the markets, suspended last year due to the pandemic, must now comply with strict safety rules that vary from state to state, with some not accepting a negative COVID test for entrance.Hamburg is among the most prominent to demand visitors demonstrate proof of vaccination against COVID-19, or provide evidence they have recently recovered from the virus, if they wish to enjoy a mulled wine, a hot chocolate or some gingerbread under festive lights in the city's main square.Unvaccinated revelers will still be able to peruse the bottle-green stalls selling handicrafts or jewelry, listen to carols, ride on the merry-go-round or admire the nativity scenes.Germany has one of the lowest vaccination rates in western Europe, with just 67% of the population fully vaccinated, and is currently reporting record caseloads as Europe's largest economy battles a fourth wave of infections.Some are even questioning the wisdom of having any markets at all as intensive care units fill up once more with COVID patients. Munich's Christkindlmarkt has become the biggest market to be canceled so far."The dramatic situation in our clinics and the exponentially rising infection numbers leave me no choice," Munich Mayor Dieter Reiter (SDP) told Bavarian radio.German football is following a similar path to Hamburg's Christmas market, with this weekend's Berlin derby between Union and Hertha set to take place with only those recently recovered from or vaccinated against, COVID-19, in attendance, the German capital's department for sport has declared.Also on Wednesday, Germany recorded its highest caseload since the onset of the pandemic.The Robert Koch Institute of infectious diseases (RKI) registered 52,826 positive tests in its daily update, while 294 people died in connection with the virus.The seven-day incidence rate in Germany now stands at 319.5 cases per 100,000 people, according to the RKI statistics, which is also the highest it has been since the pandemic began.Here are the latest major developments on coronavirus from around the world:EuropeAs of Thursday, Ireland will require bars and nightclubs to close early while ramping its booster vaccine program in a bid to combat a resurgence cases.The Irish government is also asking people to work from home again, as case numbers rise and ICUs fill up nationwide.In a televised broadcast, Prime Minister Micheal Martin said it was increasingly clear the country was experiencing "another surge" of infections and that he had "to act now.""Our advice is that everyone should work from home unless it is absolutely necessary that they attend in person," he said.Asia-PacificNew restrictions come into force in Beijing on Wednesday with visitors to the city requiring negative tests. In addition, the number of domestic flights to the capital has been reduced.With less than 100 days to before the Winter Olympics gets underway, China is bracing itself for a challenge to its zero-COVID strategy when thousands of international athletes descend on the Chinese capital after months of strict border controls.All visitors to Beijing must now show a negative coronavirus test result from the past 48 hours, while flights from higher risk areas within the country of 1.3 billion people will be canceled or limited to one a day at reduced capacity.Domestic borders of New Zealand's largest city Auckland will reopen from December 15 for those who are fully vaccinated and for people with negative test results, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Wednesday."Aucklanders have faced restrictions for an extended period of time to keep the rest of New Zealand safe. But with increased rates of vaccination it's time to open up the ability to travel again," Ardern said.Auckland was cut off from the rest of the country after the outbreak of the Delta variant in August.Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-digest-unvaccinated-banned-from-some-german-christmas-markets-101637132441367.html
17-11-2021||World||Xi Jinping era: China now blames foreign politics for Tiananmen massacre||A rare document updating and revising China’s history released by the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) has come down hard on corruption, “money worship” and extreme individualism, adding that under President Xi Jinping stronger party discipline is needed.The resolution on the party’s “achievements and historical experiences” reiterates that the Tiananmen massacre of 1989 - in which an unknown number of Chinese citizens demanding political freedom were killed by the armed forces - was caused... by “hostile anti-Communist forces”.The release of the resolution, and, separately, an explanation of the resolution by President Xi himself, has cemented his position as one of China’s most powerful leaders ever.The release of the documents - such a resolution published only for the third time in CPC’s 100-year history - strengthens President Xi Jinping’s dominance in the run-up to what is likely to be a precedent-breaking third term to begin late 2022 while enshrining his vision “Xi Jinping Thought” in China’s and CPC’s history.On the Tiananmen massacre, the resolution said: “In the late spring and early summer of 1989, a severe political disturbance took place in China as a result of the international and domestic climates at the time, and was egged on by hostile anti-communist and anti-socialist forces abroad.”“With the people’s backing, the party and the government took a clear stand against the turmoil, defending China’s socialist state power and safeguarding the fundamental interests of the people,” the resolution said.It singled out corruption as a major problem.“The (CPC) central committee has stressed that corruption is the greatest threat to the party’s long-term governance. The fight against corruption is a major political struggle that the party cannot and must not lose. If we let a few hundred corrupt officials slip through the cracks, we would let down all 1.4 billion Chinese people,” the resolution said.The resolution traces a historical overview of China from the “humiliations” of the late Qing empire to the present day, and hopes of a future “great rejuvenation”, emphasising repeatedly that the Communist party is the driver of progress.“Deng launched reforms in 1978 that transformed China from an impoverished backwater into the world’s second-largest economy. His own resolution emphasised the importance of “collective leadership” after the Maoist excesses of the cultural revolution,” a Reuters report on the resolution said.While the new document pledges to continue with “reform and opening” policies, it noted that since their launch, “erroneous trends of thought such as money worship, hedonism and extreme individualism” have emerged.But it is Xi and his influence on China and the CPC, which cuts through the clutter of some 36,000 words, as per Bloomberg, of the resolution.The CPC also saw a weakening of its leadership and corrupt practices in the reform era, it said.Stricter governance, stronger ideological work and more cultural “self-confidence” can help solve these problems, it said, noting that the Xi era had seen many long-term issues resolved.“Party members and officials should be educated and guided to have firm belief in Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era and to practice it faithfully, and they should keep in mind that empty talk harms the country while solid work makes it flourish.”“The central committee calls upon the entire party, the military, and all Chinese people to rally more closely around the central committee with comrade Xi Jinping at its core, to fully implement Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, and to champion the great founding spirit of the Party,” the resolution said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-jinping-era-china-now-blames-foreign-politics-for-tiananmen-massacre-101637124936477.html

It said Syria’s defense systems intercepted one of the incoming missiles. The attack caused no losses, the agency said.Israel carries out raids on Syria mostly during nighttime. Wednesday’s raid occurred shortly after midnight, SANA said.Israel has staged hundreds of strikes on targets inside government-controlled Syria over the years but rarely acknowledges or discusses such operations.Israel has acknowledged, however, that it is targeting bases of Iran-allied militias, such as the powerful Lebanese militant Hezbollah group. It says it is going after posts and arms shipments believed to be bound for the groups. Hezbollah is fighting on the side of Syrian President Bashar Assad’s forces in the decade-old civil war.Israel says Iranian presence on its northern frontier is a red line, justifying its strikes on facilities and weapons inside Syria.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/syria-says-israel-attack-south-of-damascus-no-casualties-reported-101637117447596.html

US, Britain and Nato had said that the debris field in low-Earth orbit generated by the anti-missile test was dangerous for orbiting spacecraft and would pose a hazard to space activities for years."The fragments that formed do not pose any threat to space activities," Shoigu said, as quoted by Russian news agencies.The anti-satellite missile test destroyed Russian spacecraft ‘Tselina-D’ which had been in the orbit since 1982, according to the Russian defence ministry. Shoigu said that the test used a “promising” system that “accurately” hit its target. Russia cited Washington’s move to establish a space force in 2020 as a reason to beef up its defence capabilities in space."The Russian Ministry of Defence successfully conducted a test on Nov. 15 that hit the non-operational Russian spacecraft Tselina-D, which had been in orbit since 1982," the defence ministry said in a statement.Debris from Russian space missile test puts ISS crew in dangerThe test drew ire from the West, with Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg calling it a “reckless” and “concerning” act. At a meeting with EU defence ministers, Stoltenberg said the anti-satellite missile test “demonstrates that Russia is now developing new weapon systems that can shoot down satellites.”France labelled Russia as “space vandals” for producing dangerous amounts of debris.US secretary of state Antony Blinken said that the debris would continue to threaten satellites and activities on the International Space Station which currently has seven crew members on board.The space station has faced frequent issues in recent times, including the smoke alarm incident in the Russian module of the ISS in September. Russia has indicated to leave the space station after 2025 and launch its own orbital station given the frequent issues with the ISS.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-west-criticism-russia-says-anti-satellite-missile-test-poses-no-threat-101637110085510.html

In the meantime, we recommend staying logged in," Snapchat support said earlier in a tweet.Fastly, the cloud company behind a major global internet outage in June, said it was seeing increased errors with origins in a "common cloud provider, unrelated to Fastly's edge cloud platform."Tuesday's brief disruption follows a six-hour widespread outage last month that crippled Meta Platforms Inc, formerly known as Facebook, after faulty configuration changes on the company's routers.Downdetector only tracks outages by collating status reports from a series of sources, including user-submitted errors on its platform. The outage might have affected a larger number of users.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-cloud-snapchat-spotify-back-up-after-brief-outage-101637108567073.html
