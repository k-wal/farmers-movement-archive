The report did not say how many weapons China has today, but a year ago the Pentagon said the number was in the “low 200s” and was likely to double by the end of this decade.The United States, by comparison, has 3,750 nuclear weapons and has no plans to increase. As recently as 2003 the US total was about 10,000. The Biden administration is undertaking a comprehensive review of its nuclear policy and has not said how that might be influenced by its China concerns.The report does not suggest open conflict with China but it fits an emerging U.S. narrative of a People’s Liberation Army, as China calls its military, intent on challenging the United States in all domains of warfare — air, land, sea, space and cyberspace. Against that backdrop, U.S. defense officials have said they are increasingly wary of China’s intentions with regard to the status of Taiwan.“The PLA’s evolving capabilities and concepts continue to strengthen (China’s) ability to ‘fight and win wars’ against a ‘strong enemy’ — a likely euphemism for the United States,” the report said, adding that it makes China more capable of coercing Taiwan, the self-ruled island that China claims as its territory.Wednesday's report is the latest reminder to Congress, already leery of Beijing’s military ambitions, that the Pentagon’s frequent promises to focus more intently on countering China have moved only incrementally beyond the talking stage. The Biden administration is expected to take a new step by following through on its announcement in September of plans to increase the U.S. military presence in Australia, in addition to a controversial decision to help Australia acquire nuclear-powered submarines.China's military modernisation is proceeding on a wide front, but its nuclear advances are especially notable.The Chinese may already have established what is known as a nuclear triad — the combination of land-, sea-, and air-based missiles that the United States and Russia have had for decades, the report said. To its existing land- and sea-based nuclear forces China is adding an air-launched ballistic missile.The Pentagon report was based on information collected through December 2020 and so does not reflect or even mention General Mark Milley’s expression of concern last month about Chinese hypersonic weapon tests last summer that he said came as a troublesome surprise. Wednesday’s report only referred to the widely known fact that China had fielded the DF-17 medium-range ballistic missile, equipped with a hypersonic glide vehicle designed to evade American missile defenses.In remarks shortly before the report's release Wednesday, Milley told the Aspen Security Forum that the hypersonic missile test and other Chinese advances are evidence of what is at stake for the world.“We are witnessing one of the largest shifts in global and geostrategic power that the world has witnessed,” he said.The Pentagon report said China is pursuing a network of overseas bases that “could interfere with” US military operations and could support Chinese military operations against the United States. President Xi Jinping has said China plans to become a global military power by 2049.The Pentagon's wide-ranging assessment of China's military strategy and force development is the latest in an annual series of reports to Congress and in some respects was more detailed than previous versions. For example, it questioned China's compliance with international biological and chemical weapons agreements, citing studies conducted at military medical institutions that discussed identifying, testing and characterizing groups of “potent toxins” that have civilian as well as military uses.The basis of the Pentagon's prediction that China will vastly increase its nuclear arsenal is not spelled out in Wednesday's report. A senior defense official who briefed reporters in advance of the report's public release, and thus spoke on condition of anonymity, said the forecast reflects several known developments, such as China's addition of a nuclear bomber capability, as well as public statements in Chinese official media that have made reference to China needing 1,000 nuclear weapons.The report also asserted that China has begun construction of at least three new missile fields that “cumulatively contain hundreds” of underground silos from which ICBMs could be launched.The report provided no details on the new missile fields, but private nuclear analysts have reported that satellite imagery shows what appear to be vast new missile silo fields under construction in north-central China. In an update published Tuesday, analysts Matt Korda and Hans Kristensen of the Federation of American Scientists said they have seen continued construction progress and have discovered “unique facilities that appear intended to support missile operations once the silo fields become operational.”One of those facilities, they said, is a complex in the mountains surrounded by what appear to be four tunnels into underground facilities. The tunnels are under construction and there are large amounts of excavated soil dumped nearby. This facility’s function is unknown but “could potentially involve missile and/or warhead storage and management,” the analysts said.Other structures under construction may be technical service facilities and launch control centers, they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-expanding-nuclear-force-faster-than-predicted-pentagon-report-101635957331348.html
03-11-2021||World||Diwali Day Act introduced in US Congress to declare festival as federal holiday||Led by Congresswoman Carolyn B Maloney from New York, lawmakers on Wednesday announced that a bill has been introduced in the House of Representatives to declare Diwali, festival of lights, a federal holiday.“I'm very, very happy and excited to be introducing the Deepavali Day Act this week alongside members of the Congressional Indian Caucus, which will enshrine Diwali into law as a federal holiday,” Maloney said at an event at the US Capitol.The historic legislation is co-sponsored by a number of lawmakers including Indian-American Congresswoman Raja Krishnamoorthi,Krishnamoorthi has also introduced a resolution in the US Congress recognising the religious and historical significance of Diwali.Maloney said that Diwali this year symbolises the nation's continuing journey out of the darkness of COVID-19.“I am very proud to celebrate with you the victory of light over darkness, the triumph of good over evil and the pursuit of knowledge over ignorance as we do every day. It is truly appropriate that Diwali this year symbolises our nation's continuing journey out of the darkness of COVID-19 and the terrible effects that Democrat depended on the people of our nation,” she said.“Celebrations like Diwali speak to the core of what we all desire for our nation to be a beacon of happiness, healing, learning and light and uncertain times. My colleagues, Indian-American community leaders and I believe that there is no better time to enshrine Diwali as a federal holiday than in the wake of this terrible dark pandemic,” Maloney said.Powerful Congressman Gregory Meeks, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, supported the legislation.“This is something that should be shared with all of us In American society. It's a good day, because we're talking about light over darkness. And that's what this is about,” Meeks said.The House Foreign Affairs Committee will be supporting this and advocating and moving forward with this great bill, he said.Krishnamoorthi said: “On this holiday of Diwali, we should say, be the light you wish to see in the world. Be the light in your community that is needed to dispel the darkness. Be the light in this community that brings hope to the hopeless. Let us be the light that helps the last, the least and the last.”“That is what Diwali is about. And that is why Diwali needs to be a federal holiday,” Krishnamoorthi said, adding that Diwali is also about celebrating Indian-Americans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/diwali-day-act-introduced-in-us-congress-to-declare-festival-as-federal-holiday-101635960542868.html
03-11-2021||World||Myanmar court denies bail for US journalist Danny Fenster, adds new charge||A court in Myanmar on Wednesday rejected the bail application of Danny Fenster, an American journalist jailed for the past five months, and added a new charge against him, his lawyer said.Fenster had already been charged with incitement for allegedly spreading false or inflammatory information, an offense punishable by up to three years in prison.He is also charged with violating the Unlawful Associations Act for alleged links to illegal opposition groups, which carries a possible two-to-three year prison term.His lawyer, Than Zaw Aung, said a new charge of violating immigration law was added Wednesday, under a catch-all provision that calls for a prison term of six months to five years for violating visa conditions.The court's actions come during a visit to Myanmar by Bill Richardson, a former US ambassador to the United Nations. He said he is on a mission to discuss humanitarian aid to strife-torn Myanmar with leaders of its military-installed government.Myanmar has been mired in violence and civil unrest since the military seized power in February, ousting the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi.Protesters against the takeover who faced beatings, shootings and arrests have turned increasingly to armed resistance, and insurgents are active in many parts of the country.Richardson's visit raised hopes that he might seek Fenster's release because he is known for his past efforts to gain the freedom of Americans detained in countries with which Washington has poor relations, such as North Korea.The United States is highly critical of army rule in Myanmar and has instituted diplomatic and economic sanctions targeting its military leadership.Fenster, managing editor of the online news magazine Frontier Myanmar, was detained at Yangon International Airport on May 24 as he was about to board a flight to go to the Detroit area in the United States to see his family.It is still unclear why he was arrested, though the charges involve his work at his previous employer, another online news service, which he left in the middle of last year.His lawyer said his application for release on bail on the sedition charge was rejected Wednesday by the judge, who said it is not allowed under the law.Than Zaw Aung also said he cross-examined seven prosecution witnesses on Wednesday for the incitement and unlawful association charges, including police and airport security personnel.He did not provide details of their testimony.The hearings at the court at Yangon's Insein Prison, where Fenster is jailed, are closed to the media and the public. The defense has not yet presented its case.The judge ruled Wednesday that the court will hold sessions every weekday starting this Friday in order to expedite the trial, Than Zaw Aung said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-court-denies-bail-for-us-journalist-danny-fenster-adds-new-charge-101635961024292.html
03-11-2021||World||Setback for Joe Biden as GOP wins Virginia gubernatorial polls||Republican Glenn Youngkin beat Democrat Terry McAuliffe for governor in the Democratic-leaning Virginia state on Wednesday. It’s a major setback for US President Joe Biden as this was the first electoral battle fought by the Democratic party under his leadership.In other elections on Tuesday, Aftab Pureval, an Indian-American became the first Asian-American mayor of Cincinnati; Eric Adams, a former police officer, was elected the second African-American mayor of New York City; and Michelle Wu became the first woman and Asian-American mayor of Boston,Youngkin’s victory in Virginia, although by a slim margin, also presented the Republican party a way forward, on how to deal with former president Donald Trump who remains popular in the party but whose divisive politics and legacy had driven away scores of moderate Republicans. Youngkin won Trump’s endorsement and his base but kept him away from campaign and did not mention him even once in his victory speech, as ex-president desperately sought credit for it in multiple statements.The other key race - for New Jersey governor - remains too close to be called. Incumbent Democratic governor Phil Murphy is locked in a close contest with his Republican challenger Jack Ciattarelli. A loss here will be the second for the Democratic party on Biden’s watch.Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial races have traditionally been seen as the first test for a US president as they take place in the first year of their presidency and usually point the way to the mid-term and presidential elections. Virginia specially, as acknowledged by Vice-President Kamala Harris.“What happens in Virginia will in large part determine what happens in 2022, 2024, and on,” Harris said at an election rally in support of McAuliffe in Virginia last week. She was referring to the mid-term Congressional elections in 2022, when Republicans are hoping to wrest control of the House of Representatives and the Senate, and the presidential election in 2024.“This is a horrible result for Democrats, and for the White House,” noted Sabato’s Crystal Ball, a political blog from the University of Virginia. “If Biden’s approval rating is in the low-to-mid 40s next year, as it is now, everything we know about political trends and history suggests that the Democrats’ tiny majorities in the House and Senate are at major risk of becoming minorities.”President Biden campaigned for both McAuliffe and Murphy, but his own waning popularity - at 42% approval rating - may have not brought them much electoral benefit.From high approval ratings for his handling of the Covid-19 epidemic and vaccination, which were both mishandled by Trump, and economic recovery, Biden has seen his popularity dipping, triggered largely by the botched handling of the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan.His ambitious legislative agenda of a massive investment in infrastructure overhaul and expansion of social benefits and climate change measures have become stuck in an internal party fight between the progressive and moderate wings of the Democratic party, casting serious doubts on its ability and willingness to govern.Glenn Youngkin’s victory in Virginia was part of the Republican’s party’s clean sweep of the top statewide posts up for grabs - the Lt Governor and Attorney General, both won by Republicans, who also flipped the House of Delegates (their Vidhan Sabha).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/setback-for-joe-biden-as-gop-wins-virginia-gubernatorial-polls-101635960360356.html
03-11-2021||World||Indian-Tibetan Aftab Pureval elected Mayor of Cincinnati||Aftab Pureval, an Indian-Tibetan has been elected as Mayor of Cincinnati city in the US state of Ohio, making him the first member of the community to be elected for such a position.Pureval, 38, a son of a refugee Tibetan mother and an Indian father, defeated his rival David Mann to win the Mayoral election.“Words can’t express how honoured and excited I am to be the next Mayor of Cincinnati. Tonight, we made history! Let’s get to work!,” Pureval, who unsuccessfully ran for the US House of Representatives last year, said this after his impressive electoral victory.Aftab Karma Singh Pureval is the first Tibetan-American and the first Asian-American Pacific Islanders (AAPI) mayor in the city's history.Pureval, a Democrat, had formerly served as Hamilton County clerk of courts.“Today, AAPI Victory Fund celebrates Aftab Pureval’s historic win as the first Indian-Tibetan American mayor of a major city, who has a bold vision to move Cincinnati forward,” AAPI Victory Fund founder and chairman Shekar Narasimhan said a day after the historic election of Pureval.In March of this year, AAPI Victory Fund had endorsed Aftab as “a necessary progressive voice that has been able to achieve success with Democrats and Republicans alike” in its slate of mayoral candidates.“This is a triumph for not only Aftab Pureval but also for the AAPI community nationwide. Aftab’s victory is a major step forward for AAPI political representation. It is more important than ever to elect diverse leadership across local, state and federal governments, and Aftab will bring his unique experience to lead Cincinnati toward a more equitable, inclusive, and just city,” said Narasimhan.In a previous interview, Pureval had told PTI that his story is improbably American.“I'm the son of a refugee. My mom was born in Tibet and she was forced to flee her home country along with my grandparents,” he said.“My grandparents, my mother picked up and made their way through the Himalayas through Nepal and into India where she grew up as a refugee,” he said.His mother studied in a Mysore school and went to Delhi for college education, where she met his Punjabi father.“My (paternal) grandfather was in the Indian military (Brg. Ajit Singh),” he said.After marriage, his parents moved to the US and settled in Ohio where he was born in 1982. He has travelled to Tibet once as a child, but has been a frequent visitor to India, especially to Delhi to meet his grandparents, who passed away recently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indiantibetan-aftab-pureval-elected-mayor-of-cincinnati-101635958354221.html

Truman was today re-elected President of the United States of America for four years in one of the most sensational upsets in American history. His 46-year-old Republican opponent, Mr Thomas Dewey, Governor of New York, conceded his surprise victory in this photo finish election at 4-15 p.m., G.M.T., (9-45 p.m., I.S.T.)- after the world had been kept waiting for nearly 12 hours. Sixty-four-year-old Democrat, Mr Truman, the "hopeless chance," also swept his party to power in both Houses of Congress in one of the closest election races in U.S. history. Mr. Dewey said Mr. Truman was sure to win an Electoral College majority. From New York Mr. Dewey sent a congratulatory telegram to Mr Truman at Kansas City. The telegram said: "My heartiest congratulations to you on your election and every good wish for a successful administration and urge an Americans to unite behind you in support of every effort to keep our nation strong and free and establish peace in the world." Voting figures had run neck to neck through some 15 hours of counting before Mr. Dewey finally conceded. When Mr. Dewey conceded, Mr. Truman was leading in 28 States, carrying between them 304 electoral votes. Required to win are 266 electoral votes. Mr. Dewey was leading in 16 States with 189 electoral votes.The last Republican hope that Mr. Dewey might nose out the President in the electoral vote, even though he was trailing well behind in popular voting, apparently faded with the late California returns, which put Mr. Truman ahead in that State. The political prophets were completely confounded by the final out-come of the keen contest, though Mr. Truman himself had complete confidence in the result. Congress results were still not final, but latest returns indicated this line-up. Senate:-54 Democrats and 42 Republicans-required majority 49.House of Representatives: 246 Democrats, 188 Republicans and one American Labour-required majority 218. The Republicans had been in the majority in both Houses of Congress since 1946.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ht-this-day-nov-4-1948-truman-elected-u-s-president-101635956739306.html
03-11-2021||World||US 'black lists' Israeli maker of Pegasus spyware||US authorities on Wednesday put the Israeli maker of the Pegasus spyware on a list of restricted companies, taking aim at software central to a scandal over surveillance of journalists and officials.The company, NSO, was engulfed in controversy over reports that tens of thousands of human rights activists, journalists, politicians and business executives worldwide were listed as potential targets of its Pegasus software.Smartphones infected with Pegasus are essentially turned into pocket spying devices, allowing the user to read the target's messages, look through their photos, track their location and even turn on their camera without them knowing."These tools have also enabled foreign governments to conduct transnational repression, which is the practice of authoritarian governments targeting dissidents, journalists and activists outside of their sovereign borders to silence dissent," the US Commerce Department said in a statement.NSO did not immediately reply to a request for comment.Washington also targeted Israeli company Candiru, Singapore-based Computer Security Initiative Consultancy PTE (COSEINC) and Russian firm Positive Technologies.- 'Zero-click' attack -The companies' addition to the so-called "entity list" means that exports to them from US organizations are restricted. For example, it is now far harder for American researchers to sell them information or technology.An international media investigation reported in July that several governments used the Pegasus malware, created by NSO Group, to spy on activists, journalists and politicians."Today's action is a part of the Biden-Harris Administration's efforts to put human rights at the center of US foreign policy, including by working to stem the proliferation of digital tools used for repression," the Commerce statement said.Following the initial concern over Pegasus, a subsequent wave of worries emerged when iPhone maker Apple released a fix in September for a weakness that can let the spyware infect devices without users even clicking on a malicious message or link.The so-called "zero-click" is able to silently corrupt the targeted device, and was identified by researchers at Citizen Lab, a cybersecurity watchdog organization in Canada.UN experts have called for an international moratorium on the sale of surveillance technology until regulations are implemented to protect human rights following an Israeli spyware scandal.Israel's defense establishment has set up a committee to review NSO's business, including the process through which export licenses are granted.NSO has insisted its software is intended for use only in fighting terrorism and other crimes, and says it exports to 45 countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-black-lists-israeli-maker-of-pegasus-spyware-101635953853390.html

Thirty people suspected of posting “lies” have been referred to the judiciary for investigation, the statement said. The Turkish leader’s health became a hot subject on social media after a short video clip purportedly showing him walking with great difficulty went viral on Friday. Another video in July showed Erdogan dozing off for a few seconds during an address to members of his ruling AK Party, unleashing speculation that the 67-year-old president might be ailing. Aides have posted videos of Erdogan playing basketball and other sports to dispel what they say is pure speculation. On Wednesday, spokesman Fahrettin Altun shared a 13-second video on Twitter showing a masked Erdogan taking 19 steps away from a black limousine outside the presidential palace, followed by a military officer in line with protocol. The video title read: “Trust for friends, fear for enemies.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkey-begins-probe-into-twitter-posts-suggesting-president-erdogan-died-101635943956577.html
03-11-2021||World||Tennis star Peng Shuai’s #MeToo claim against retd vice-premier rocks China||A #MeToo allegation against a retired top Communist Party of China (CPC) official has sparked an online firestorm and swift censorship in China. Peng Shuai, 35, a former Chinese world number one in doubles tennis, has accused former vice-premier Zhang Gaoli, 75, of coercing her into having sex and subsequently continuing an on-and-off secret relationship with her for years.Peng’s allegations against Zhang, made in an emotional post on China’s Twitter-like Weibo on Tuesday night, is the first #MeToo allegation against a top CPC leader.Zhang Gaoli, the vice-premier, was among the seven members of the CPC Politburo Standing Committee, the highest decision-making body in China, between 2013 and 2018, under President Xi Jinping.Peng’s post, published at 10pm on Tuesday, was swiftly deleted but not before netizens had taken screenshots and shared it across social media platforms.Any search related to the topic including Peng’s name and the word “tennis” was banned from Weibo late on Tuesday night.The swift censorship indicated the level of sensitivity that the Chinese government attaches to any discussion on the top leadership’s alleged misdemeanours even if it involves retired leaders.Peng’s accusations made in Mandarin could not be corroborated.Neither Peng nor Zhang have made any public comments following the former’s Weibo post.The Chinese foreign ministry declined to comment when asked for a response on Peng’s allegations and the censorship.“I have never heard and this is not a diplomatic question,” foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said on Wednesday.Peng, who has played with and against Indian tennis star, Sania Mirza, has won the women’s doubles at both Wimbledon and French Open.In her post, that goes back and forth in time, Peng said she had sexual relations with Zhang when he was the top party official of Tianjin, a city some 100km from Beijing, between 2007 and 2012.She said he had first assaulted her after inviting her to play tennis with him and his wife.“I never consented that afternoon, crying all the time,” she wrote, not specifying when exactly the assault occurred, according to a translation of the post by the New York Times.Peng wrote that after that he was promoted to the Standing Committee in 2013 and during his tenure as a member of the party leadership, Zhang did not contact her.But after he retired in 2018, he contacted her and their relations resumed though his wife knew about it.Peng was invited by Zhang to his home at a time when his wife was present and was forced into a sexual relationship, the post says. Subsequently, they could often meet in secret and spend time with each other.The post suggests Zhang tried to end the relationship with Peng on Tuesday while saying he was afraid of leaving evidence such as recordings.“I feel like a walking corpse, pretending, pretending every day, which I am the real me? I shouldn’t have come to this world, but I don’t have the courage to die. I really want to live simply, but it backfired,” she wrote.“I know that for someone of your eminence, vice-premier Zhang Gaoli, you’ve said that you’re not afraid,” Peng wrote in her post as per the NYT translation, “but even if it’s just me, like an egg hitting a rock, or a moth to the flame, courting self-destruction, I’ll tell the truth about you.”Lu Pin, the founder of the now-banned Chinese online forum Feminist Voices, wrote on her Twitter handle why Peng’s post was important.“Peng Shuai’s revelation is very important. It allows people to see the real-life of China’s top leaders as never before. Behind the power-wrapped morality, their excessive abuse of power, corruption…” Lu wrote.“First of all, she has a lot of shame and self-blame, and she even talks about ‘love’. After all, everyone is poisoned by patriarchy. But the important thing is that, like other victims, she knows from the bottom that all that is unjust and that she is being bullied, even if there is no ready-made term to define what happened to her,” Lu added.“China’s quickly-stifled #MeToo movement has ensnared academics, journalists, NGO workers…but never had a high-level party official been accused. The burden of proof and the political pressure brought to bear will be huge. And Peng herself admits to having no evidence,” SupChina, a New York-based China-focused website reported.“So quickly are social media posts being censored on Chinese sites about this that people are resorting to using #tennis and #melon (meaning drama) in Chinese to talk about this…both terms are trending on Weibo now,” the SupChina report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tennis-star-peng-shuai-s-metoo-claim-against-retd-vice-premier-rocks-china-101635938998098.html
03-11-2021||World||At COP26, India & UK launch Green Grids Initiative to offer clean power to world||Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his United Kingdom's counterpart Boris Johnson jointly launched a new flagship international initiative late on Tuesday night at the COP26 World Leaders' Summit in Glasgow, backed by over 80 countries, to dramatically accelerate the global transition to clean powered world.Jointly led by India and the United Kingdom, the new initiative, called ‘Green Grids Initiative – One Sun One World One Grid’ (GGI-OSOWOG), is aimed at accelerating the development and deployment of interconnected electricity grids across continents, countries and communities, and improve energy access of the poorest through mini-grids and off-grid solutions.It features as one of the leading initiatives under the Glasgow Breakthroughs also launched at the clean innovation and technology event, part of a new joint plan that will see countries and businesses coordinate and strengthen their climate actions every year in polluting sectors to dramatically scale and speed up the deployment of clean technologies and drive down costs globally.Apart from India and the UK, Australia, France and the United States are also part of the steering committee of the 'Green Grids Initiative'.Modelled on the UK’s recent net-zero strategy, the Glasgow Breakthroughs will see countries and businesses coordinate and strengthen their climate actions every year in each sector to dramatically scale and speed up the deployment of clean technologies and drive down costs. The aim is for clean technologies to become the default choice this decade globally in each polluting sector and to catalyse the growth of a new economy built around new green industries and jobs globally.In launching the GGI-OSOWOG, the two Prime Ministers unveiled the ‘One Sun Declaration’ setting out a shared vision of harnessing the full potential of clean power globally through the much greater interconnection of electricity grids across continents, countries and communities, including mini-grids and off-grid solutions to ensure no one is left without access to energy.To meet the goals of the Paris Agreement and limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the world will need to transition to clean power, increasing the global reliance on renewable energy, like solar and wind power. Transitioning to this clean powered future will require developing an electricity infrastructure that is capable of coping with far greater shares of variable renewable energy, while meeting growing power demands securely, reliably and affordably.Speaking after the launch, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the ‘One Sun One World One Grid’ and ‘Green Grids Initiative’ is “an idea whose time has come." “If the world has to move to a clean and green future, these interconnected transnational grids are going to be critical solutions. I congratulate the International Solar Alliance and the UK COP Presidency for bringing it nearer to implementation,” Modi said.The GGI-OSOWOG will help make this happen, by bringing together a global coalition of energy grid stakeholders, including governments and businesses, to accelerate the expansion of energy grids across regions and continents and create the foundations for universal access to sustainable energy. This will ensure the infrastructure is in place for the whole world to be powered by renewable energy, as part of the global push to realise the clean energy transition. Echoing his Indian counterpart, UK's Prime Minister Boris Johnson said his country is working hand in hand with “friends in India to transform the future of the power sector” and ensure clean and reliable electricity is accessible everywhere by the end of this decade.“It’s fantastic that over 80 countries have backed our newly launched Green Grids Initiative, whose collaboration will not only see greater growth, jobs and investment in our global green future but also make sure no one is left without access to energy," Johnson said.Keeping 1.5 degrees Celsius alive means global emissions will need to be cut in half by 2030. Achieving this will require a dramatic acceleration in innovation and deployment of clean energy solutions, and on a global scale. The International Energy Agency’s recent analysis calls for a tripling in investment in grid expansion and modernisation from $260 billion to $800 billion annually by 2030.The initiative will help to mobilise financial and technical resources to advance grid developments, and also promote the sharing of existing expertise and best practice across the globe. This international collaboration will be key to making the clean energy transition faster, cheaper and easier for all.The new GGI-OSOWOG initiative combines the UK Green Grids Initiative with India’s One Sun One World One Grid programme. This joint programme will create a global coalition of leading actors in the green grids field, to accelerate the expansion of energy grids across regions and continents.As a leading new international initiative, the global GGI-OSOWOG will support the newly launched ‘Breakthrough Agenda’, and specifically the ‘Glasgow Power Breakthrough’, which aims to make ‘clean power the most affordable and reliable option for all countries to meet their power needs efficiently by 2030’.This initiative represents the strong historic bilateral relationship between the UK and India.

The company said that those employees have been put on unpaid leave."Our employees have done their part, with now over 96 per cent fully vaccinated. The employees who are not vaccinated or do not have a medical or other permitted exemption have been put on unpaid leave," ANI quoted the company's deputy chief executive officer, Michael Russo, as saying.This came after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, in October, ordered air, rail and shipping companies to establish vaccination policies for their workers.The vaccination requirement was also made compulsory for airlines as well as concession and hospitality workers.Canada has registered a total of 1,720,355 cases of Coronavirus (Covid-19) disease and 29,056 deaths for the entire period of the pandemic. The daily number of Covid-19 cases is currently decreasing, with 2,283 new cases registered per day. Canada has administered at least 58,756,154 doses of Covid-19 vaccines, which means about 78 per cent of the country's population has been vaccinated.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/air-canada-puts-over-800-unvaccinated-employees-on-unpaid-leave-report-101635926085364.html

It is a major step forward for our nation in our fight to defeat the virus.”The CDC said the vaccination of children could begin “as soon as possible”. Distribution of the paediatric vaccine has already begun and plans afoot to scale up to full capacity starting on November 8, CDC said, adding that vaccines will be available at multiple locations, including paediatric health care provider offices, pharmacies, Federally Qualified Health Centers (HRSA).“Together, with science leading the charge, we have taken another important step forward in our nation’s fight against the virus that causes Covid-19,” said CDC head Rochelle Walensky. “As a mom, I encourage parents with questions to talk to their paediatrician, school nurse or local pharmacist to learn more about the vaccine and the importance of getting their children vaccinated.”Pfizer’s paediatric vaccine was nearly 91% effective in preventing Covid-19 among children aged 5-11 years in clinical trials, same as for the vaccine fro adults and adolescents. Vaccine side effects were mild, self-limiting, and similar to those seen in adults and with other vaccines recommended for children, CDC said. The most common side effect was a sore arm. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had cleared the paediatric vaccine earlier. It’s the same Pfizer vaccine but the dosage is a third of what is administered to adults and teens. It will be administered in same regimen: two shots three weeks apart, but using a smaller needle.Covid-19 cases among children are known to result in hospitalizations, deaths, MIS-C (inflammatory syndromes) and long-term complications, such as “long Covid,” in which symptoms can linger for months, the CDC has said. The spread of the more transmissible Delta variant during past summer led to a surge in in Covid-19 cases in children. The CDC said that during a six-week period in late June to mid-August, Covid-19 cases among children spiked five fold.With the CDC clearance, the US becomes one of the few countries to be inoculating children. Among countries using other Covid-19 vaccines in children under 12 is China, which just began vaccinations for 3-year-olds, according to Associated Press news agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/major-step-forward-us-gives-final-approval-of-pfizer-s-covid-vaccine-for-children-aged-511-101635925076698.html

Taking to Twitter, Trump Jr. said that the Democrats had collapsed under President Biden.Also Read | US Election Day 2021: All you need to know“When Biden wakes up tomorrow afternoon, somebody's gonna have to tell him he is officially presiding over the collapse of the Democrat Party,” the 43-year-old businessman tweeted, as exit polls projected victory for Glenn Youngkin in Virginia and Jack Ciattarelli in New Jersey over Terry McAuliffe and Phil Murphy, respectively. When Biden wakes up tomorrow afternoon, somebody’s gonna have to tell him he’s now officially presiding over the collapse of the Democrat partyWhile Youngkin is projected to comfortably defeat former Virginia governor McAuliffe, the race between Ciattarelli and incumbent Phil Murphy in New Jersey is expected to be close, with a slight edge to the former.Trump Jr., meanwhile, also shared a statement from his father in which the former President congratulated Youngkin. “I would like to thank by BASE for coming out in force and voting for Glenn Youngkin. Without you, he would not have been close to winning. The Make America Great Again (MAGA) move is bigger and stronger than ever before. Glenn will be a great governor,” the statement read. Congrats to @GlennYoungkin!!! https://t.co/VfX2GIsOr5The New Jersey and Virginia gubernatorial elections, which, along with several other polls, constituted November 2's ‘Election Day,’ were held in the backdrop of the United States' chaotic military exit from Afghanistan, with American forces leaving the war-torn nation on August 30, nearly 20 years after arriving on the Afghan soil in 2001. Biden faced severe flak for the execution of the pullout, though he said there was "never a good time to withdraw US forces."The American exit from Afghanistan paved the way for the Taliban to seize power in that country for a second time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/when-biden-wakes-up-tomorrow-trump-jr-mocks-us-president-over-election-day-results-101635916818476.html
03-11-2021||World||In blow for Biden, Republican wins tight election in Virginia||The Republican candidate pulled off a stunning upset to win the governor's mansion in the US state of Virginia Wednesday, US television networks projected, in a race seen as an early verdict on President Joe Biden's first year in office.Newcomer Glenn Youngkin was 2.7 points ahead of Democrat Terry McAuliffe in the neck-and-neck tussle shortly after midnight, with more than 95 percent of the vote counted, prompting NBC, CNN and ABC to call the election for the Republican.A harbinger of the parties' prospects in next year's midterm elections, the race was initially expected to be a comfortable Democratic win but instead became a toss-up in the closing days of the campaign.A private equity multi-millionaire who has never run for office defeating a former popular Democratic governor will be seen as a disaster for Biden going into the all-important 2022 races that will determine who controls Congress."All right Virginia -- we won this thing! How much fun!" Youngkin, who poured at least $20 million of his own fortune into the race, told cheering fans after dancing onstage to Norman Greenbaum's 1969 hit "Spirit in the Sky."Calling his victory a "defining moment," he told the crowd: "Together, we will change the trajectory of this commonwealth. And friends, we are going to start that transformation on day one."The election, a neck-and-neck tussle for weeks, resonated nationwide as a proxy war between Biden and former president Donald Trump, who gave Youngkin his early backing.Youngkin's campaign will now likely become a blueprint for Republicans across the country as they strategize on how to leverage Trump's base while avoiding becoming tainted by his toxic brand among moderates in the midterms.Difficult yearThe Democratic faithful had badly wanted the race to be a referendum on Trump but in reality he had little to do with the campaign and was never likely to prove the galvanizing nemesis they had hoped for.Early in the campaign, Youngkin accepted Trump's endorsement and steered clear of criticizing the twice-impeached former president.But he also pointedly avoided standing next to the Republican leader, who is seen as beyond the pale among independents in much of Virginia, or presenting himself as a Trump acolyte.McAuliffe's loss will also almost certainly spook moderates on Capitol Hill and drive some away from supporting Biden's stalled $3 trillion vision for remaking the economy.The long delays on passing promised social welfare and infrastructure packages are an echo of 2009-10, when the Democrats suffered big losses amid gridlock in Washington.Elections were also being held in multiple other states, with voters overwhelmingly backing Democrat Eric Adams for mayor of New York and Democratic New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy just behind in a surprisingly close reelection battle he was nevertheless expected to win.But Virginia is where the battle lines had been most visibly drawn.Culture warMcAuliffe faced significant headwinds as he tried to mount a return to an office he held four years ago, with the majority party in Washington usually incurring losses during a president's first term.Youngkin had to perform his own high-wire act, as the vast majority of Republicans believe Trump's false claims that the presidency was stolen in a fraudulent election, making acknowledging the truth politically risky.He turned the conversation instead to local "culture war" issues like abortion, mask mandates and the teaching of America's racial history.McAuliffe took an early lead in the race but his seven-point cushion evaporated in the final days, with a polling average by political analysis website FiveThirtyEight showing Youngkin ahead by one point on election day.Leaning into his image as the establishment candidate, the 64-year-old McAuliffe sold himself as a former incumbent who brought back jobs after the worldwide financial crisis of 2008, and pledged to repeat the trick for the pandemic.But nine months after Democrats added the US Senate to their victory in the White House, Virginians sought a fresh start, handing Youngkin 51 percent of the vote and the Republican Party its first statewide office in the so-called Old Dominion in over a decade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-blow-for-biden-republican-wins-tight-election-in-bellwether-virginia-101635918030840.html

The group has been protesting against the Pakistan government for months, demanding the release of its party chief Saad Rizvi who was arrested in April this year.TLP is the same group that spearheaded the major anti-France protests after President Emmanuel Macron defended the right of a satirical magazine to republish cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed.“Some 860 TLP workers were freed on Tuesday. They were detained under section 3 of MPO (maintenance of public order). No case was registered against them,” the Punjab Home Department said in a statement, according to news agency PTI. Other detainees from the protest who have first information reports (FIRs) registered against them would have to obtain bail from courts, the report further said.Last week, thousands of TLP supporters began a march from the eastern city of Lahore to capital Islamabad. The protesters reached about one-third of the way before they called it off. However, the protests are still continuing with protesters staging a sit-in at parks in the city of Wazirabad. The demonstrators say that they will not withdraw their agitation until the Pakistan government fulfills 50 per cent of the terms of their agreement."In case any further arrests of the party’s workers or leaders are made, the agreement with the government will stand cancelled," said Tehreek-e-Labbaik's Mufti Muneeb Rehman, warning the Pakistan government, PTI reported. “If the government appears non-serious with regard to the agreement, it will have to face a more forceful protest movement,” Muneeb also said.Details regarding the deal between the group and the Pakistan government are not known yet.

The next one was about the Quetta attack on lawyers in which we also lost journalists. Here, the PFF did most of the work, which was also not easy as it required sensitivity," Dawn quoted Haque as saying."I don't usually do the writing and edits for our website but for this particular site, I personally sat down to do all that. The data, the stories of each fallen journalist is horrifying, it affects you," he said.According to senior journalist Ghazala Fasih, the figures shared by PPF show that 76 journalists have been murdered since 2002, Dawn reported.A report of the Freedom Network launched on the eve of the International Day to End Impunity for Crimes against Journalists, said that nearly two dozen journalists in Pakistan were charged in the last two years and most of them were prosecuted under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA), as per The News International.Despite being a democratic state, Pakistan continues to suppress free speech in digital spaces, stopping its citizens from participating in the working of the state by depriving them of a resourceful channel for vocalising their concerns.Report 2020 by Media Matters for Democracy (MMfD) says that the country performed poorly in all the indicators that determine free speech and that the Covid-19 pandemic further exacerbated the digital censorship in Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/website-launched-in-pakistan-to-highlight-govt-s-crackdown-against-media-101635913094086.html

The highly-infectious delta variant is hurtling across the country in latest round of spike despite the increasingly aggressive measures that local officials have enacted in a bid to thwart it.On Wednesday, China recorded 93 fresh cases of Covid-19, setting another daily record. Local infections have been found in 19 of 31 provinces. Eleven asymptomatic infections were also reported, according to National Health Commission, which are not added to the official tally.This is up from 54 a day earlier and the highest daily count since August 9 at the peak of China's last major outbreak. Beijing reported nine new local infections, the most since January 19.Three more provinces detected cases - central Chongqing, Henan and Jiangsu on the eastern coast.The fresh outbreak has so far been concentrated mostly in northern China. With the latest daily caseload, China has recorded 631 cases of Covid-19 between October 17 and November 2.Meanwhile, officials in China said they are committed to maintaining the zero-tolerance Covid policy despite the flare-ups that are coming faster, spreading further and evading many of the measures that previously controlled it.Temperature screening has been set up at entrances of shopping malls, supermarkets, hotels, cinemas and subway stations in Beijing, while a legion of personnel on the ground check the health codes of visiting individuals on their mobile phones.More than 33,000 visitors inside Shanghai's Disneyland were allowed to leave on Sunday only after their Covid test results came negative as one confirmed patient had visited the resort on Saturday.As of November 2, mainland China had 97,423 confirmed cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/93-cases-in-24-hours-how-covid-19-is-rearing-its-head-again-in-china-101635912858501.html

Siblings JJ Altobelli and Alexis Altobelli, whose mother, father and sister were killed, will share another $1.25 million.Bryant's widow Vanessa has also sued Los Angeles County, alleging that she and her family suffered emotional distress over the pictures. That lawsuit continues.An investigation into the crash found the pilot had probably become disorientated after flying the Sikorsky S-76 into clouds.Bryant is widely recognized as one of the greatest basketball players ever, a figure who became the face of his sport during a glittering two decades with the Lakers.He was a five-time NBA champion in a career that began in 1996 straight out of high school and lasted until his retirement in 2016.He was also a two-time Olympic gold medalist, helping spark the US squad of NBA stars to titles in 2008 in Beijing and 2012 in London.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kobe-bryant-chopper-crash-victim-families-win-2-5-million-over-photos-101635912019852.html
03-11-2021||World||'Unprecedented nuclear buildup': Concerns as China missile silos show progress||China has made significant progress at three sites, suspected to be missile silo fields, which have western experts concerned. The three sites are located near Yumen, Hami and Ordos in north-central China.Their progress is being monitored by Federation of American Scientists (FAS), a US-based non-partisan policy think tank. They have studied the progress at the three missile sites through commercial satellite images provided by Planet Labs and Maxar Technologies.These images offer the most detailed pictures yet of the three sites, where FAS believes China is constructing 300 new missile silos.The FAS researchers believe that the pace of construction gives them confidence that they are related to Chinese military's modernisation programme. The progress has been reported almost on a weekly basis, said FAS."For China, this is an unprecedented nuclear buildup," Matt Korda and Hans M Kristensen, the authors of FAS report said on Tuesday, adding that is raises questions and uncertainty about China's minimum nuclear deterrent and policies.The authors, however, added, "The apparent missile silo fields are still many years away from becoming fully operational and it remains to be seen how China will arm and operate them."Both Korda and Kristensen fear the rapid pace at which the silos are being constructed could increase nuclear competition and fuel worst-case planning in other nuclear weapon states.The first silo field was discovered in June this year. Another report a second field was discovered in July, prompting the US Strategic Command to tweet about "the growing threat the world faces and the veil of secrecy that surrounds it".FAS had then said that these sites signify "the most significant expansion of the Chinese nuclear arsenal ever". It added that this is the most extensive silo construction since the US and Soviet missile silo construction during the Cold War.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unprecedented-nuclear-buildup-concerns-as-china-missile-silos-show-progress-101635911023445.html
03-11-2021||World||Eric Adams wins in NYC, capping ascent from cop to mayor-elect||Eric Leroy Adams was elected the 110th mayor of New York City Tuesday, following a campaign in which he won the support of New Yorkers across class and racial lines with promises to restore the pandemic-ravaged city to its former glory.The Associated Press declared the 61-year-old Democratic Brooklyn borough president the winner over Republican anti-crime activist Curtis Sliwa. Adams had 67% of the vote with 65% of precincts reporting, according to the AP, which called the race 11 minutes after polls closed.“I’m perfectly imperfect, and the city is made up of perfectly imperfect people,” Adams said at an Election Night party at the Marriott hotel in Downtown Brooklyn. “That’s the combination that will allow us to create a perfect city where no one is left behind.”Flanked by family and supporters, Adams used his victory speech to highlight the resolve of blue-collar New Yorkers who helped propel him to City Hall. He also called for unity in a “divided” city, pledging to bring firefighters, police officers and other civil servants into the fold.The mayor-elect also targeted business leaders as partners in the city’s future growth, seeking to deviate from Mayor Bill de Blasio’s anti-business rhetoric. “We have to get this out of our head that the CEOs in this city don’t want to participate in uplifting our city,” he said. “It’s time to build bridges we’ve destroyed in the past. We need each other.” In another contrast with de Blasio, who clashed with former Governor Andrew Cuomo, Adams also used the moment to showcase his determination to work alongside Governor Kathy Hochul. Taking center stage in the middle of Adams’s Tuesday night speech, Hochul called her relationship with Adams the beginning of a “new era of cooperation.”Following the speech, Adams’s campaign said he was headed to an after-party at the members-only club Zero Bond in Manhattan, where billionaire Mike Novogratz and Wendi Deng were already in attendance. Adams’s election to what’s known as the “second-toughest job in America” catapults him to a national political figure at the center of some of the nation’s most intractable debates. He’s a reform-minded but tough-on-crime former police officer at a time of rising worries about crime and frayed police-community relations. He’s a moderate Democrat in an increasingly progressive party. And he’s proclaimed an end to “anti-business” rhetoric while demanding the city’s businesses better address income inequality and other social ills.Tuesday’s victory over Sliwa, founder of the Guardian Angels anti-crime patrol, was preordained in a city where Democrats outnumber Republicans by roughly 7-to-1. Sliwa tried to capture the city’s attention with TikTok videos and publicity stunts centered around a platform of public safety, tax reform and animal rights. Adams dismissed his challenger’s campaign as “buffoonery.”In a new era for city government, Democrat Alvin Bragg was elected Manhattan’s first Black district attorney and Democrat Brad Lander was elected city comptroller.De Facto Mayor-ElectAdams has conducted himself as the de facto mayor-elect since July, when a lengthy ballot-counting process ended with Adams atop a 13-candidate Democratic field. Primary election results showed that Adams won on the strength of Black, Hispanic and low-income voters in the city’s outer boroughs. After his victory, he was quick to proclaim himself the “face of the new Democratic party” and weigh in on vaccine mandates, school programs and other decisions made by outgoing Mayor Bill de Blasio.When Adams is sworn in Jan. 1, he will replace the term-limited de Blasio, whose eight-year mayoralty was defined by the coronavirus crisis, clashes over policing and an ill-fated run for president.“The policies I ran on, they were clear,” he said outside a polling site in Brooklyn Tuesday. “It’s about being safe. It’s about working on behalf of blue-collar people.”Incoming New York mayors have faced challenges before. Ed Koch inherited a crime-ridden city on the verge of bankruptcy in 1978. Former Mayor Michael Bloomberg was nominated in a primary election scheduled on Sept. 11, 2001 and had to rebuild a city devastated by the terrorist attacks. Bloomberg, founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP, has endorsed Adams.Adams will inherit his own set of problems plaguing New York: Race relations, violent crime, budget headaches, an exodus of work-from-home professionals and a series of union contracts up for negotiation. And Adams’s penchant for trying to be all things to all people -- coupled with vague or even conflicting solutions to some of those problems -- has left business leaders wondering how Adams will act once he shifts from campaigning to governing.Blue-Collar MayorThe second Black mayor in the city’s history, Adams calls himself New York City’s first blue-collar mayor. He was born in Brooklyn in 1960, and his family moved to Queens when he was 8. Adams often recounts how he joined a gang at 14, and was arrested and beat by police at 15. And at 24 -- inspired both to serve and reform the New York Police Department -- he joined the force.Over 22 years of law enforcement experience, Adams led groups of Black officers and rose to the rank of captain -- giving him a unique and often complicated perspective on policing. He was criticized during the Democratic primary for supporting stop-and-frisk policies, albeit a modified version.He first started plotting a run for mayor as early as the 1990s, and briefly registered with the Republican party before running for the New York Senate as a Democrat in 2006. He served four terms in the Senate and two as Brooklyn borough president, where he was all but unopposed.Borough presidents have limited powers, but Adams often used the position to fast-track residential development in Brooklyn while also railing against gentrification. In an interview with Bloomberg News, Adams said he would reverse the “uninviting spirit” that businesses found in the city over the last eight years -- but that begins with an emphasis on safety.“The prerequisite to prosperity is public safety and justice. If the city is not safe, if we don’t bring down gun violence, gang violence, if we don’t bring down those crimes, then our tourism will be impacted,” he said. “Businesses would be impacted. We can’t get employees back into the office spaces because people are afraid to ride the subways.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eric-adams-wins-in-nyc-capping-ascent-from-cop-to-mayorelect-101635911023196.html

Youngkin is ahead in the race, CNN has reported.(3.) In New Jersey, incumbent Phil Murphy from the Democrats is pitted against Republican Jack Ciattarelli. Various polls have given an edge to Murphy.(4.) Cities which are witnessing mayoral contests are New York City, Boston, Atlanta, Buffalo, Minneapolis and Miami. In New York City, Democrat Eric Adams, a former officer in its police department, will defeat Curtis Silwa from the Republicans, CNN projected.(5.) If victorious, Adams will be the second African-American mayor of New York City. He will succeed Bill de Blasio.(6.) Minneapolis, meanwhile, will witness its first polls since the George Floyd incident in May last year. Voters in the city will not only decide the fate of incumbent Jacob Frey, who held the post at the time of Floyd's killing by the police, but they will also vote to decide if the police department should be replaced by a Department of Public Safety.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-election-day-2021-all-you-need-to-know-101635901725144.html

His dining-account purchasing power less so, at least until a recent study released by the National Bureau of Economic Research.“He dined often and very well,” as revealed in the series of novels and short stories launched by Ian Fleming and continued by a number of successors, economists Lee A. Craig, Julianne Treme and Thomas J. Weiss wrote in an NBER working paper.The economists constructed data sets for both Bond’s estimated salary and the cost of meals at French restaurants that he went to. Analysis shows that the British secret agent’s purchasing power depreciated over time -- especially since the 1999 introduction of the euro, which has climbed versus the pound.“As measured by a luxury basket of goods that included a weekly dinner and wine for two at a French restaurant, Bond, early on in his career, i.e. during the Fleming era of the 1950s and 1960s, would have spent 18% (using current exchange rates) of his salary,” the economists said.During the euro era, that share would have climbed to 26% on average. By about 2019, Bond “would have needed a third of his salary to dine well regularly in France,” they wrote.To compile the estimates, the economists scoured the Bond books for names of restaurants -- 23 of which were in France, and all but two of those were included in the Michelin Guide. They then used Michelin Guide prices to cost out Bond’s meals.The sample includes a variety of restaurant types, ranging from two of the most highly rated restaurants in France -- Oustau de Baumaniere, located in Les Baux de Provence, and Grand Vefourn in Paris, both of which had 3 stars -- to bistros like Le Galion in Menton, Chez Andre and Terminus Nord in Paris, and La Rotonde de Montparnasse as well as La Rotonde in Nice.The authors said it was possible to chart the price of a typical meal for a sample of some 18 of the French restaurants going back to 1953.As for Bond’s salary, Fleming revealed in “Moonraker” in 1955 that he earned 1,500 pounds a year, nearly 3.5 times the average annual earnings in the U.K. at the time. A subsequent salary was estimated “based on that of someone in the same Civil Service grade as Bond,” which would have risen 6.3% annually on average through 2019 -- roughly keeping pace with meal prices, the working paper showed.A second series was estimated under the scenario that Bond might have earned a “risk premium,” or extra increases for his years in service.“Even at that higher salary, he would still have had to spend 21% of his income at current exchange rates on dinner for two in the 2002-19 period,” the authors wrote.” “While that may seem a little too steep for many of us, perhaps not for a bon vivant like Bond, who, after all, was not saving for his children’s orthodontia or education.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/james-bond-s-salary-hasn-t-kept-up-with-french-restaurant-costs-shows-study-101635902520943.html

A lot has been achieved in the fight against the disease, with many countries launching their own vaccines to counter the infection.However, the number of cases around the globe has crossed 240 million and the disease has claimed more than five million lives. But, the pace of the spread has slowed down in recent weeks.India, for example, recorded 10,423 new cases on Tuesday, the lowest in 259 days. The active cases too declined to 1,53,776, the lowest in 250 days. The daily rise in new coronavirus infections in India has been below 20,000 for 25 straight days and less than 50,000 daily new cases have been reported for 128 consecutive days now.And there are some countries which have been able to control the infection more effectively. The World Health Organization (WHO) hosts a list of all the countries and keeps updating it based on the number of Covid-19 cases recorded in last 24 hours.Some of these countries recorded zero Covid-19 cases in the last 24 hours, according to WHO dashboard. They are:• Canada• Argentina• Spain• Bangladesh• Belgium• Costa Rica• Sri Lanka• Ecuador• Myanmar• Honduras• Ghana• El Salvador• Cameroon• Maldives• LuxembourgThere are many other countries which have been able to stave off the pandemic, since these are islands in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. Some strict travel policies are also responsible for negligible spread of the infection in some geographies.For example, Switzerland recorded just three new cases of Covid-19 in the last 24 hours, according to WHO data. Similarly, Oman recorded eight new cases and Zambia five. Others to record 10 or less new Covid cases are Mozambique, Kosovo, Senegal, Malawi, Eswatini, Burundi and Madagascar.However, for countries which report zero or very less number of Covid-19 cases, health experts have in the past expressed concerns that some cases may fly under the radar. Accurate and updated data can be difficult to obtain from countries like North Korea and Turkmenistan, which drew international skpeticism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-spread-countries-which-reported-zero-cases-in-last-24-hours-101635902583163.html
03-11-2021||World||Islamic State claims responsibility as 19 die in Kabul hospital attack||At least 19 people were killed and 50 more wounded in an attack on a military hospital in Kabul on Tuesday, the latest atrocity to rock Afghanistan since the Taliban seized power.The Taliban's rivals, the Islamic State group, claimed responsibility for the gun and bomb assault in the centre of the capital.Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K) said in a statement on its Telegram channels that "five Islamic State group fighters carried out simultaneous coordinated attacks" on the sprawling site."The IS insurgents wanted to target civilians, doctors and patients in the hospital," Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said, claiming that Taliban forces had repulsed the attack within 15 minutes.As part of the response, he said, Taliban "special forces" were dropped onto the roof of the hospital from one of the helicopters that the group seized from Afghanistan's former US-backed government.The attack got under way when a suicide bomber detonated his explosives near the facility's entrance. Gunmen then broke into the hospital grounds, firing their weapons."Nineteen dead bodies and about 50 wounded people have been taken to hospitals in Kabul," a health ministry official who asked not to be named told AFP.Mujahid played down the death toll, but confirmed that two Taliban fighters, two women and a child had been killed outside the hospital.One woman who had been trapped in the hospital when the attack began told AFP how she and her friend "felt we were going to die, that our lives were ending"."There was a blast at the door," Rowana Dawari, a poet and lecturer, told AFP."Daesh came and started firing, we were stuck. We heard firing, glass breaking. We locked ourselves in a bathroom," she said, referring to IS by its local name."Later, Taliban came and we saw they were with our doctors, so we knew it was OK."Amanudhin, a 28-year-old cleaner at the hospital, pushed an elderly, frail and partially sighted patient, Mariam, away from the scene in a wheelchair."The explosion happened and after a while people started screaming 'Daesh is here'," he told AFP. "We heard a lot of firing."We were in the 7th floor and locked ourselves in a room. There were injured people everywhere. Broken glass."They hid until Taliban fighters came to rescue them: "They were special forces, professionals, they broke the door and got inside."Going 'room to room' The Taliban spent 20 years waging an insurgency against the ousted US-backed government.Now they face the struggle of bringing stability to Afghanistan, which has been hit in recent weeks by a series of bloody assaults claimed by the Islamic State group's local chapter."All the attackers are dead. The attack was initiated by a suicide bomber on a motorcycle who blew himself up at the entrance of the hospital," a Taliban official from the government media team said.Two explosions targeted the hospital area, he had earlier said in a statement.AFP staff in the city heard a second explosion some 30 minutes after the first was reported."I heard a big explosion coming from the first checkpoint. We were told to go to safe rooms. I also hear guns firing," a doctor at the Sardar Mohammad Daud Khan hospital told AFP while the attack was being carried out."I can still hear gun firing inside the hospital building. I think the attackers are going from room to room... like the first time it was attacked," the doctor added.Ambulances speeding through KabulThe hospital, which treats wounded soldiers from both the Taliban and former Afghan security forces, was previously attacked in 2017, when gunmen disguised as medical personnel killed at least 30 people in an hours-long siege.Although both IS and the Taliban are hardline Sunni Islamist militants, they differ on details of religion and strategy.IS have claimed four mass casualty attacks since the Taliban takeover on August 15, including suicide bomb blasts targeting Shiite Muslim mosques. The group regards Shiite Muslims as heretics.The 2017 attack was also claimed by the Islamic State group, and the Taliban denied responsibility.Pictures shared on social media on Tuesday showed black smoke billowing into the air after the explosions, the first of which went off at around 1:00 pm (0830 GMT).Roads close to the heavily fortified "Green Zone" where the buildings of several former Western embassies were located were closed off to traffic and Taliban guards scaled up searches.The US State Department condemned the attack, spokesman Ned Price said in a tweet Tuesday evening."We mourn those killed and offer our condolences to their loved ones," he said. "Targeting medical professionals and patients is abhorrent and has no justification."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/islamic-state-claims-responsibility-as-19-die-in-kabul-hospital-attack-101635902260741.html

03-11-2021||World||WHO urges vaccine against bacteria killing 150,000 babies each year||The World Health Organization on Wednesday called for the urgent development of a vaccine against a bacterial infection responsible for nearly 150,000 stillbirths and infant deaths each year.A fresh report by the UN health agency and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine found that the impact of Group B Streptococcus infection (GBS), which is estimated to live harmlessly in the intestinal tracts of up to a third of all adults, is a far bigger cause of preterm births and disability than previously thought.The report confirmed a previous devastating finding from 2017 that the bacterium causes almost 100,000 newborn deaths and close to 50,000 stillbirths each year, although it pointed to significant data gaps suggesting the true figures could be higher.And for the first time it quantified the impact on preterm births, finding that GBS is behind more than half a million early deliveries each year, leading to significant long-term disability.In light of such staggering numbers, the report authors lamented that more progress had not been made towards developing a vaccine."This new research shows that Group B strep is a major and underappreciated threat to newborn survival and wellbeing, bringing devastating impacts for so many families globally," Phillipp Lambach of WHO's immunisation department said in a statement."WHO joins partners in calling for urgent development of a maternal GBS vaccine, which would have profound benefits in countries worldwide."Professor Joy Lawn, who heads LSHTM's maternal adolescent, reproductive and child health centre, agreed."Maternal vaccination could save the lives of hundreds of thousands of babies in the years to come," she said, decrying the lack of progress since the idea of developing a jab against GBS was first raised three decades ago.On average, 15 percent of pregnant women worldwide, or nearly 20 million annually, carry the GBS bacterium in their vagina.But even though most of these cases show no symptoms, an infected pregnant woman can pass GBS to her foetus via the amniotic fluid, or during birth as the infant passes through the vaginal canal.Babies and foetuses are particularly vulnerable because their immune systems are not strong enough to fight the multiplying bacteria.If untreated, GBS can lead to meningitis and septicaemia, which can be deadly. Babies that survive may develop cerebral palsy, or permanent sight and hearing problems.Wednesday's report showed that the bacterium leaves some 40,000 infants each year with neurological impairments.Currently, women with GBS are given antibiotics during labour to reduce the chance of it passing to their baby.But this approach poses problems in places where screening and antibiotic administration during labour are less accessible.Tellingly, the highest rates of maternal GBS are found in sub-Saharan Africa -- which alone accounts for around half of the global burden -- and Eastern and South-Eastern Asia, the study showed.It suggested that a GBS vaccine that could be administered to pregnant women during routine pregnancy checkups and that reached over 70 percent of pregnant women could avert 50,000 infant and foetus deaths each year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-urges-vaccine-against-bacteria-killing-150-000-babies-each-year-101635900550693.html
03-11-2021||World||US gives final nod to Pfizer Covid-19 shots for kids aged 5 to 11||U.S. health officials on Tuesday gave the final signoff to Pfizer’s kid-size Covid-19 shot, a major expansion of the nation’s vaccination campaign.The Food and Drug Administration already authorized the shots for children ages 5 to 11 — doses just a third of the amount given to teens and adults. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends who should receive FDA-cleared vaccines.The announcement by CDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky came only hours after an advisory panel unanimously decided Pfizer’s shots should be opened to the 28 million youngsters in that age group.Millions of shots made by Pfizer and its partner BioNTech have already been shipped to states, doctors’ offices and pharmacies, to be ready for CDC's decision.An influential advisory panel on Tuesday recommended kid-size doses of Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine for all children ages 5 to 11, putting the U.S. on the brink of a major expansion of vaccinations. A final decision was expected within hours.The Food and Drug Administration already authorized the shots for the younger age group — doses just a third of the amount given to teens and adults. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention formally recommends who should receive FDA-cleared vaccines — and its advisers unanimously decided Pfizer’s shots should be opened to 28 million youngsters.If the CDC’s director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, signs off as expected, it will mark the first opportunity for Americans under 12 to get the powerful protection of any Covid-19 vaccine.“Today is a monumental day in the course of this pandemic,” Walensky told the advisory panel as it began its deliberations earlier Tuesday.She said while the risk of severe disease and death is lower in young children than adults, it is real — and that Covid-19 has had a profound social, mental health and educational impact on youngsters, including widening disparities in learning.“There are children in the second grade who have never experienced a normal school year,” Walensky said. “Pediatric vaccination has the power to help us change all of that.”Millions of shots made by Pfizer and its partner BioNTech have already been shipped to states, doctors' offices and pharmacies — in orange caps, to avoid mix-ups with purple-capped vials of adult vaccine.The American Academy of Pediatrics welcomed the vote as its members get ready to start the first injections into little arms as soon as they're given the final OK. The 5- to 11-year-olds will receive two shots, three weeks apart, the same schedule as everyone else -- but using a smaller needle.“Sharing this life-saving vaccine with our children is a huge step forward and provides us all with more confidence and optimism about the future,” said Dr. Lee Savio Beers, academy president.Many parents have clamored for vaccine protection for youngsters so they can resume normal childhood activities without risking their own health — or fear bringing the virus home to a more vulnerable family member. But CDC's advisers said they recognize many parents also have questions, and may be fearful of the vaccine because of rampant misinformation.The panelists said they want parents to ask their pediatrician about the shots — and to understand that they're far better than gambling that their child will escape a serious coronavirus infection. As for safety, more than 106 million Americans have safely gotten two doses of Pfizer’s full-strength shots — including more than 7 million 12- to 15-year-olds.“I have vaccinated my kids,” said CDC adviser Dr. Helen Keipp Talbot of Vanderbilt University, saying she wouldn’t recommend something for other families unless she was comfortable with it for her own. “We have seen the devastation of this disease.”In the U.S., there have been more than 8,300 hospitalizations of kids ages 5 to 11, about a third requiring intensive care, according to government data. The CDC has recorded at least 94 deaths in that age group, with additional reports under investigation.And while the U.S. has seen a recent downturn in Covid-19 cases, experts are worried about another uptick with holiday travel and as winter sends more activity indoors where it’s easier for the coronavirus to spread.Pfizer's study of 2,268 youngsters found the kid-size vaccine is nearly 91% effective at preventing symptomatic Covid-19 -- based on 16 diagnoses among kids given dummy shots compared to just three who got the real vaccination.The FDA examined more children, a total of 3,100 who were vaccinated, in concluding the shots are safe. The younger children experienced similar or fewer reactions -- such as sore arms, fever or achiness -- than teens or young adults get after larger doses.That study wasn’t large enough to detect any extremely rare side effects, such as the heart inflammation that occasionally occurs after the second full-strength dose, mostly in young men and teen boys. Regulators ultimately decided the benefits from vaccination outweigh the potential that younger kids getting a smaller dose also might experience that rare risk.Some of CDC's advisers said for some parents, deciding to get their children vaccinated may hinge on that small but scary risk.“The risk of some sort of bad heart involvement is much higher if you get Covid-19 than if you get this vaccine,” Dr. Matthew Oster, a pediatric cardiologist at Emory University, told the panel. “COVID is much riskier to the heart.”Last week, FDA’s advisers struggled with whether every young child needed a vaccine. Youngsters hospitalized with Covid-19 are more likely to have high-risk conditions such as obesity or diabetes. But otherwise healthy children can get seriously ill, too, and the CDC’s advisers ultimately recommended the shots for all of them — even children who’ve already recovered from a bout of Covid-19.CDC officials calculated that for every 500,000 youngsters vaccinated, between 18,000 and 58,000 Covid-19 cases — and between 80 and 226 hospitalizations — in that age group would be prevented, depending on the pandemic's trajectory. And CDC officials noted that Covid-19 has caused more deaths in this age group than some other diseases, such as chickenpox, did before children were routinely vaccinated against them.What about younger children? Pfizer is testing shots for babies and preschoolers and expects data around the end of the year. The similarly made Moderna vaccine also is being studied with young children. But the FDA still hasn't cleared its use in teens, and the company is delaying its application for younger children pending that review.A few countries have begun using other Covid-19 vaccines in children under 12, including China, which just began vaccinations for 3-year-olds. But many that use the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine are watching the U.S. decision, and European regulators just began considering the companies’ kid-size doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-gives-final-nod-to-pfizer-covid-19-shots-for-kids-aged-5-to-11-years-101635898353289.html
