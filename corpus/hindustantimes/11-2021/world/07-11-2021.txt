This was a much-awaited decision as the US authorities have been buying time to finally open the country for foreign travellers. The restrictions stopped many Indians living in the US from coming to India as they would have been stuck in India with the US not allowing Indian travellers so far.The restriction was imposed by then President Donald Trump in early 2020 when the pandemic just started and is finally being withdrawn after the world valiantly fought multiple waves of the pandemic.Here is all you need to know1. Only fully vaccinated travellers will be allowed to travel to the United States.2. Still, the travellers will have to carry proof of negative coronavirus test before boarding the flight.3. Passengers will need to show their vaccination status to the airlines which will match the name and the date of birth to confirm that no one can carry someone else's vaccination certificate.4. All FDA- and WHO-approved vaccines are recognised by the US authorities. And this includes India's indigenous vaccine Covaxin as the vaccine has been given emergency use approval by the WHO.5. The US will also reopen its land borders with Canada and Mexico for vaccinated people.6. Allowing only fully vaccinated travellers are almost like issuing a vaccine passport and the condition will leave out people of many countries. The government said it will consider passengers from those countries if there is a humanitarian or emergency reason.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-allow-vaccinated-foreign-travellers-from-november-8-covaxin-allowed-101636304700351.html

The CIA revelations show the lengths some agencies are willing to go to in their persecution of Julian," Moris was quoted as saying by the daily.Assange and Moris have been engaged for five years and have two children together. They have asked for assistance in arranging the marriage in May, when the whistleblower was already in jail awaiting extradition appeal trial, the newspaper said. However, the process stalled and Assange applied for official permission directly with the Belmarsh chief on October 7, to no effect. The couple's lawyers also reportedly failed to get a response from the prison authorities.The lawsuit accuses Raab and Belmarsh Governor Jenny Louis of abusing their power over Assange, behaving irrationally and unfairly, and denying the couple and their children their human rights, the Daily Mail said.The accused have until November 12 to respond.Assange was arrested in London on April 11, 2019, and sentenced to 50 weeks in prison for jumping bail in 2012. He took refuge inside the Ecuadorean embassy in the UK capital to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he was facing sexual assault charges that were later dropped by a Swedish court.Assange is wanted by the United States on espionage charges after WikiLeaks published thousands of classified documents that shed light on war crimes committed by American troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. If put on trial and convicted in the US, the whistleblower faces up to 175 years in prison.In September, it was revealed that senior US officials and the CIA were allegedly discussing the possibility of kidnapping and killing Assange in 2017 while he was hiding in the Ecuadorian embassy in London.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/julian-assange-fiancee-file-lawsuit-against-uk-minister-prison-for-preventing-their-marriage-101636301611895.html

By the mid-year mark, nearly half of the population – some 18.4 million people – were already in need of humanitarian and protection assistance in 2021,” the report further noted.Also read | From November 8, Afghanistan to begin nationwide polio vaccination campaignMeanwhile, the spokesperson for UN secretary-general pointed to reports that showed isolated clashes and violence affecting civilians and resulting in casualties continued across the war-torn country this week, according to a report by news agency ANI.Further, the report also said that issues related to food security were driven largely due to drought and even after the harvest, as much as 57% of the households did not have food reserves to last for three months.Also, the situation is expected to deteriorate in 10 out of the 11 most populated urban areas, the report said. “In urban areas, income loss (driven by economic shocks) has contributed to the rapid deterioration in food insecurity,” the report showed.“No population group had a net positive income in 2021. Assessments show that more households have higher than average debt this year. This is increasingly concerning as food basket costs are steadily rising, constituting more than 82 per cent of the average HH income,” it further said.Earlier in October, a report released by the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the UN World Food Programme (WFP) echoed similar alarming forecasts for the country.“The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) report has found that more than one in two Afghans will be facing crisis (IPC Phase 3) or emergency (IPC Phase 4) levels of acute food insecurity through the November 2021 to March 2022 lean season, requiring urgent humanitarian interventions to meet basic food needs, protect livelihoods and prevent a humanitarian catastrophe,” the FAO had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nearly-55-of-afghan-population-expected-to-face-food-insecurity-from-nov-2021-to-mar-2022-says-un-report-101636297874910.html

07-11-2021||World||Sudan security fires tear gas on anti-coup protesters||Sudanese security forces on Sunday fired tear gas at an anti-coup rally by teachers at the start of a two-day civil disobedience call against last month's military takeover.Dozens of teachers carried banners reading "no, no to military rule" and demanded a transition to "full civilian rule" at a rally outside the education ministry in the capital Khartoum.Nationwide anti-coup protests -- including by tens of thousands on October 30 -- have occurred since the October 25 coup but have been met by a deadly crackdown. At least 14 demonstrators have been killed and about 300 wounded, according to the independent Central Committee of Sudan's Doctors."We organised a silent stand against the decisions by Burhan outside the ministry of education," said Mohamed al-Amin, a geography teacher who took part in that protest against the country's top general, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan."Police later came and fired tear gas at us though we were simply standing on the streets and carrying banners," he said.There were no confirmed reports of casualties but about 87 teachers have been detained, according to the Sudanese Professionals Association, an umbrella of unions which called for the Sunday-Monday civil disobedience.The teachers' rally came after the military leadership which carried out the coup replaced heads of department at the education ministry, as part of sweeping changes it made in multiple sectors."The protest rejects the return of remnants of the old regime" linked to ousted president Omar al-Bashir, the teachers' union said in a Facebook post.Sunday's rally followed calls for civil disobedience made by SPA, an umbrella of unions which were instrumental in the 2018-2019 protests which led to the ouster of longtime strongman Bashir in April 2019."The Sudanese people have rejected the military coup," the SPA said on Twitter, vowing "no negotiation, no partnership, no legitimacy"."We will start by barricading the main streets to prepare for the mass civil disobedience on Sunday and Monday," it said, urging protesters to avoid confrontation with the security forces.In the overnight darkness into Sunday protesters were seen piling up bricks and large slabs to block streets in Khartoum and neighbouring cities, according to witnesses and AFP correspondents.Text messagesThe SPA circulated its latest appeals via text messages to bypass internet outages since the putsch."Movement on the streets is less than usual but there is not full blockage of streets or closure of shops" after the civil disobedience call, said a witness from Omdurman who declined to give his name fearing reprisals.On Sunday there appeared to be mixed compliance with the call among retailers. Some shops were still open but others were shuttered in Khartoum and its twin cities of Omdurman and Khartoum-North, according to witnesses.The latest resistance effort came almost two weeks after Burhan dissolved the government as well as the ruling joint military-civilian Sovereign Council that was supposed to lead the country toward full civilian rule.Burhan also declared a state of emergency and detained Sudan's civilian leadership.Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok was briefly detained but later placed under effective house arrest.On Thursday, the military released four civilian members of his government. Others are still held and, on that same day, security forces arrested other civilian leaders near a United Nations building in Khartoum following their meeting with UN Special Representative for Sudan Volker Perthes."We call upon the military leadership to cease arresting politicians and activists and to stop committing human rights violations," Perthes said in a statement on Friday.The military takeover sparked international condemnation, including punitive aid cuts and demands for a swift return to civilian rule.Burhan insists it "was not a coup" but a move to "rectify the course of the transition."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sudan-security-fires-tear-gas-on-anti-coup-protesters-101636291699862.html

The Lahore high court set aside their conviction on Saturday and acquitted all six men, with an unnamed court official telling PTI news agency that the prosecution had failed to prove the charge against the men beyond any reasonable doubt. The court also observed that the statement of the prosecution’s star witness was not reliable as “there is no corroboratory evidence”.In a statement issued at the conclusion of its plenary meeting, FATF had called on Pakistan to address as soon as possible the sole remaining item in its 27-point action plan to counter terror financing by “continuing to demonstrate that [terror financing] investigations and prosecutions target senior leaders and commanders of UN-designated terrorist groups”.FATF president Marcus Pleyer had also said Pakistan has taken several important steps but still needs to demonstrate that probes and prosecutions are being pursued against the senior leadership of UN-designated terror groups. Zafar Iqbal, a senior leader and co-founder of LeT, was designated by the UN Security Council in 2012 for being in-charge of the terror group’s finance department. The listing said Iqbal had travelled to Saudi Arabia with Saeed in 1989-1990 to request financial support from slain al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden.Yahya Mujahid, a spokesperson for JuD, was listed by the UN Security Council in 2009 for his links with al-Qaeda, bin Laden and the Taliban, and for his role in financing, planning and facilitating the activities of LeT. Abdul Rahman Makki has been listed as a “specially designated national” by the US treasury department for his role as the second in command of LeT. The US has also offered a $2-million bounty for Makki.People familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity that Pakistan often arrests and charges leaders of terror groups such as LeT ahead of meetings of FATF to create the impression that it is cracking down on terror. Often, investigations in such cases are not thorough and cases are rushed through the lower courts, the people said.Pakistan was added to FATF’s grey list in mid-2018 and given the 27-point action plan to control money laundering and terror financing. In June this year, FATF asked Pakistan to implement another seven-point action plan to address serious deficiencies related to money laundering.Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said, “Basically, Pakistan has done this sort of thing time and again. In the aftermath of the 2008 Mumbai attacks that were carried out by LeT, the initial dossier compiled by Pakistan’s Federal Investigation Agency showed the lackadaisical attitude towards investigations and collection of evidence.”He added, “Pakistan indicted only LeT operations commander Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi but not the other key players in the Mumbai attacks. After every terror attack that comes in for global scrutiny, they engage in the facade of arresting some suspects, and once the pressure eases, it’s back to business as usual.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-court-acquits-let-jud-leaders-despite-fatf-s-call-for-targeting-terror-groups-101636292270895.html

Sydney also saw hundreds of protesters marching with slogans like “Your Body Your Choice”, another news outlet Sydney Morning Herald reported.The protests were aimed at Australian state Victoria’s premier Daniel Andrews who also introduced the Pandemic Management Bill which will allow the premier of the state to declare a pandemic and extend it in three-month blocks. The bill also allows the Australian health minister to enforce public health orders with much freedom.Protesters in Australia carried placards with phrases like "free Victoria" and "sack Dan Andrews" in Melbourne as they marched towards the Parliament House expressing their opposition to the mandatory vaccination rule as well as the bill. A report from Sky Australia said that Andrews said that citizens of Victoria who remain uninoculated will be subject to Covid-19 restrictions in 2022 as well.The polls conducted by media outlets however show that anti-vaxxers in Australia are much smaller compared to the people who would get vaccinated.Where else in the world are people protesting vaccine mandates?Several Western nations have seen protests against mandatory Covid-19 vaccinations with the US seeing large scale protests among others as the Biden administration recently asked large companies to mandate that their workers get vaccinated against Covid-19 or submit to regular testing.The Republican attorney generals in Texas, Florida, Missouri and 23 other states have sued to block the rule proposed by the Biden administration.France, which has a Covid pass rule, managed to extend the rule which allows the government to make use of the pass till July next year. The system is one of the strictest in Europe, reports news agency AFP, but the protests against the rule which were a weekly occurrence until recently have diminished recently.(with inputs from ANI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccine-mandate-protesters-in-australia-s-major-cities-take-to-the-streets-101636290301356.html

The vaccination campaign in the war-ravaged country was announced by the United Nations in October.“Without any doubt polio is a disease that without treatment will either kill our children or cause them with permanent disability, so in this case the only way is to implement the vaccination,” Dr Qalandar Ebad, the Taliban's acting health minister said, according to the Associated Press.Before taking over Afghanistan in August, the Taliban for the last three years had banned the UN for carrying out polio eradication drives in parts of the country that were under their control.The Taliban were suspicious that members of the vaccination teams could be spies for the previous governments or the West, the Associated Press further reported.Meanwhile, in other areas in Afghanistan, the vaccination campaign was out of the question due to infighting between previous government and insurgents along with fears of roadside bombs and kidnappings.Since 2018, around 3.3 million children have not been vaccinated against polio because of the Taliban's ban."To eliminate polio completely, every child in every household across Afghanistan must be vaccinated, and with our partners, this is what we are setting out to do," Hervé Ludovic De Lys, Unicef Representative in Afghanistan, said in a statement last month.The target population for the four-day vaccination campaign in Afghanistan is 10 million children below the age of five, which also includes the above 3.3 million who did not receive the jab.Polio, a life-threatening disease which is transmitted through contaminated water or food, or in contact with an infected person, has been virtually eradicated globally except for Afghanistan and some parts of Pakistan.Dr Nek Wali Shah Momin, a health ministry official in the polio eradication department, told the Associated Press that the vaccination drive in Afghanistan is a gigantic task and urged for the support of all lined departments.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/from-november-8-afghanistan-to-begin-nationwide-polio-vaccination-campaign-101636285566792.html

07-11-2021||World||Canada: National Hockey League team dons Diwali-themed jerseys||In a first, players from a major North American sports franchise donned Diwali-themed jerseys designed by an Indo-Canadian artist.The commemorative jerseys were commissioned by the Vancouver Canucks of the National Hockey League (NHL) from artist Jagandeep ‘Jag’ Nagra, who is based in the town of Pitt Meadows in British Columbia. They were worn during warmups prior to their game against the Nashville Predators on Friday night.Nagra was elated at Diwali being marked at such a platform, as she said the “atmosphere (at the arena) was amazing”. The jerseys could not be worn during the game itself due to NHL rules for standard uniforms. But an auction following the game, saw one being snapped up for as much as almost 5,000 Canadian dollars ( ₹3 lakh).And the initiative captured eyeballs worldwide. Reacting to a report, actor-director Seth Rogen tweeted, “Will trade a vase for one of these!” and exchange direct messages with Nagra on Twitter. As it was later featured on ESPN’s SportsCenter, singer-songwriter Nick Jonas tweeted, “So cool.” Cabinet minister Harjit Sajjan also thanked Nagra.Nagra, who was born in Surrey in BC, and has roots in the Jalandhar area in Punjab, was thrilled as she watched her design on the rink: “Honestly, I was holding back tears the whole time. This was the biggest sense of pride I had felt. It was really an amazing moment,” she told the Hindustan Times.For the design of the crests for the jerseys, Nagra used motifs associated with Diwali, like mustard oil, often used for traditional lamps, as well as diyas, a lotus, and stars, to create a sense of twinkling lights at dusk. And, of course, an ice hockey stick. In a release, the team said the design for these custom-made jerseys “honours elements of both Diwali and the Vancouver Canucks brand”.As she said, “I wanted to include icons that to me represented Diwali.”They also featured Diwali-coloured name bars in Hindi and Punjabi.Of course, the jerseys matched the occasion as this was also the fifth ‘Diwali night’ being celebrated by the Vancouver Canucks.The team may have lost the game on Friday night, but the project came out a winner, with partial proceeds from the sale of the jerseys going towards rejuvenation of the iconic Punjabi Market in Vancouver, which is over 50-years-old, but has become run down in recent years. That pleased Nagra even more as she also serves as the creative director of the Punjabi Market Regeneration Collective.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-national-hockey-league-team-dons-diwali-themed-jerseys-101636283566797.html

The Taliban also reportedly want to bolster inventory and skillset among its ranks, said the report further."We are trying to use the previous government's air force - the professionals that they had - and make sure they all return. The best policy for us is - whatever department is needed; we are going to have it," ANI quoted a spokesperson for the Taliban's Ministry of the Interior, Qari Saeed Khosty, as saying. "No doubt, a full air force will be built soon - once the regime is fully established. It is not fully established yet," another person familiar with the development was quoted as saying by ANI.Recently, three Taliban-piloted helicopters including a US Black Hawk deployed a quick reaction force at Kubal's main military hospital Sardar Dawood Khan during a suspected ISIS-K attack.Before the Taliban seized Kabul, the Afghan Air force had more than 200 aircraft that included 167 planes, according to the June 2021 assessment by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction.However, it is still unclear that how much of the equipment that the Taliban captured from the Afghan Air Force is operable. An insider said that the main focus of the Taliban is to use the aircraft only in urgent situations and not "not to waste resources", said the ANI report, citing knewz.The Taliban had captured nine major airbases across the country including the strategic provinces of Khost, Kunduz, Mazar-e-Sharif, and Herat.According to the ANI report, the Taliban top leadership said that they are determined to become a "self-sufficient" force in view of the economic crisis gripping the country after the international community freezed the financial aid to the war-torn country.The spokesperson for the Ministry of Defense, Enayatullah Khwaraizmi, also highlighted that it is vital for the new Afghan military to be "fully independent" and said that the external cooperation policies will still be determined by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said the ANI report further, citing knewz.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-express-their-intention-to-build-their-own-air-force-in-afghanistan-101636276230161.html

The apex court also ordered the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provincial government in October 2021 to recover ₹33 million (USD 1,94,161) from the culprits involved in vandalising the century-old shrine.In December last year, over 1,000 people led by some local clerics belonging to the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam Fazl (JUI-F) instigated the villagers to demolish the temple and as a result, people led by local seminary students attacked the temple.The Supreme Court was informed that 109 people involved in the incident had been arrested.Earlier in 1997, the shrine was first attacked and severely damaged, and the PHC head Vankwani had approached the apex court in 2015 seeking help to restore the holy place and restart the annual pilgrimage to the place.“At that time, local clerics were creating hurdles to holding a religious congregation for the Hindus, while the followers of Shri Paramhans Ji tried to build the temple at the place but it was not allowed,” Vankwani had told Dawn.After the Supreme Court issued directives to the provincial government to restore and preserve the Teri temple, the Pakistan Hindu Council started holding the annual fair in 2015.Since the temple is being managed by the local Hindu families, it comes administratively under the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province government and not under the ETPB control, according to the report.Hindus form the biggest minority community in Pakistan.According to official estimates, 75 lakh Hindus live in Pakistan. However, according to the community, over 90 lakh Hindus are living in the country.The majority of Pakistan's Hindu population is settled in Sindh province where they share culture, traditions and language with Muslim residents. They often complain of harassment by the extremists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-hindu-council-to-celebrate-diwali-at-teri-temple-which-was-attacked-in-2020-101636276871289.html

Amirabdollahian told Wang that Iran is committed to the talks on reviving nuclear agreement and is willing to step up coordination with China on the matter.Iran last week announced the resumption of multi-party nuclear talks that have been stalled for months. The negotiations are aimed at restoring the beleaguered 2015 atomic deal that former US President Donald Trump exited more than three years ago. The nuclear agreement, which the Trump administration quit in 2018 to reimpose sanctions, gave international monitors unprecedented access to Iranian nuclear facilities. However, many of those powers have been suspended since February, eroding international oversight on the program. Iran denies its nuclear program has a military component, but distrust of that claim led world powers to seek the 2015 deal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/united-states-should-rectify-its-nuclear-moves-china-tells-iran-101636274903344.html

There were 2,928 infections from the local community and 102 from dormitories for migrant workers as well as five infections who arrived from abroad, according to a report by the Channel News Asia.As of Saturday, Singapore has reported 215,780 COVID-19 cases since the start of the pandemic and 480 deaths.In its efforts to boost hospital capacities, Singapore has converted the F1 Pit Building used for Grand Prix races into a 721-bed COVID-19 treatment facility, the Channel reported.Starting Tuesday, the facility will only take in elderly patients, those who are unvaccinated and above 70 years old or vaccinated and above 80 years old.Patients will be admitted after being assessed by hospitals and they will be monitored by medical staff round the clock. They will have to be generally well and should also be independent.To be discharged from the facility, vaccinated patients will have to clear a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) swab test on Day 6 from when they were confirmed to have COVID-19. Unvaccinated patients will need to test negative on Day 10.If they test positive, vaccinated and unvaccinated patients will be discharged on Day 10 and Day 14 respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-records-3-035-covid-cases-reports-rare-virus-mis-c-among-children-101636274639842.html
07-11-2021||World||The Pakistan factor: Why India, China ties remain challenging since 1971||China is marking its 50th year at the United Nations amid much fanfare with President Xi Jinping saying the decision to “recognise the representatives of the government of the People’s Republic of China (PRC as the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations ... was a victory for the Chinese people and a victory for people of the world”.India, as it turns out, was among the first countries to congratulate China when it became a UN member on October 25, 1971, even calling the absence of the east Asian country from the international body a “perverse mistake”.After Beijing’s UN entry, India and China, however, almost immediately fell out at the global forum over the India-Pakistan war and the formation of Bangladesh in 1971.Barely five weeks into the UN, in its first intervention at the UN Security Council, China lashed out at India for sending troops into then east Pakistan, literally calling it a “gangster” and “fascist” for doing so.China also strongly criticised the USSR for supporting India, and this might be difficult to believe now, said “…the Soviet government is the boss behind the Indian aggressors”.Beijing’s full-fledged support for Pakistan, now established “iron brothers”, at the UN was indicative of rapidly maturing bilateral ties.On October 27, two days after the PRC’s return to the UN was announced, former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, wrote a warm letter to Premier Zhou Enlai.“On behalf of the Government and the people of India may I convey to your Excellency and the Government and the people of China our felicitations on the restoration of the legitimate right of representation of China by your Government in the United Nations,” she wrote.“This will make the United Nations more representative in character and will give greater weight to Asia’s participation in the deliberations of any decisions of this organisation.”“We look forward to the PRC playing its rightful role in the United Nations and working in close cooperation with your delegation in the interest of peace and progress in Asia and throughout the world,” she added.Two weeks later, India’s permanent representative to the UN, Samer Sen, followed up Gandhi’s letter with a speech welcoming Beijing’s inclusion.“In 1949, the PRC came to power in the great and ancient land of China after a long and sustained revolution. In 1950, India was the first country to propose that, as a result of this change in China, the Chinese seat in the United Nations should be occupied by the representatives of the PRC,” Sen said.“In spite of consistent efforts by India and an increasingly larger number of states, it has taken the United Nations 21 years to correct a perverse mistake. The fact that we find that today China is fully restored to its lawful rights in the United Nations is therefore a matter of great satisfaction to India,” Sen added in his speech.That satisfaction could have been short-lived as Beijing came out all diplomatic guns blazing in favour of Islamabad.“The question of East Pakistan is purely the internal affairs of Pakistan, in which no one has any right to interfere. It is impermissible for the Indian government to commit armed aggression against Pakistan by using the question of East Pakistan as a pretext. 2. The Indian government asserts that it has sent troops to East Pakistan for the purpose of ‘self-defence’. This is sheer gangster logic,” China’s UN representative Huang Hua said in a speech on December 4, 1971.Three days later, another Chinese representative, Chiao Kuan-hua said in a statement: “Supported by a certain big power, the Indian government has become most arrogant and rampant. It openly clamours that since Pakistan is a neighbour of India, the existence of Pakistan troops in East Pakistan constitutes in itself a threat to India. This is sheer fascist nonsense”.In fact, in August, 1972, China also used its first UN Security Council veto to bar the newly formed Bangladesh from entering the UN.China finally recognised Bangladesh in the middle of 1975, months after Pakistan did.China and Bangladesh at present enjoy warm ties with Beijing describing the relation as a “strategic partnership of cooperation”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/the-pakistan-factor-why-india-china-ties-remain-challenging-since-1971-101636274746003.html

The jets entered the ADIZ off Taiwan's southwestern coast, following a path similar to previous incursions.What is Taiwan's ADIZ?The ADIZ extends hundreds of kilometers from Taiwan's coast and even includes parts of mainland China. It is much larger than Taiwan's sovereign air space, which only extends 12 nautical miles from the coast.The ADIZ is airspace designated for national security purposes but is not delineated in international treaties. Taiwanese authorities reserve the right to order aircraft entering the ADIZ to identify themselves and their purpose.Although China has flown regular incursions with smaller numbers of aircraft into the ADIZ over the past several weeks, the warplanes have not entered Taiwan's sovereign airspace.EU delegates visit TaiwanThe Chinese flights into the ADIZ on Saturday came a day after a European Parliament delegation wrapped up a three-day visit to Taipei.The seven lawmakers on the parliament's committee on foreign interference in democratic processes visited last week, following up on a resolution last month calling for the body to “intensify EU-Taiwan political relations.”EU parliamentarians said the visit was not aimed at provoking China, which considers self-governing Taiwan as part of its territory and usually considers any attempt at building bilateral ties between Western nations and the government in Taipei as a provocation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-says-16-chinese-warplanes-enter-air-defense-zone-101636272235961.html
07-11-2021||World||Explainer: The difference between 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming||Over and over at the UN climate summit in Glasgow, world leaders have stressed the need to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.The 2015 Paris Agreement commits countries to limit the global average temperature rise to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, and to aim for 1.5°C.Scientists have said crossing the 1.5°C threshold risks unleashing far more severe climate change effects on people, wildlife, and ecosystems.Preventing it requires almost halving global CO2 emissions by 2030 from 2010 levels and cutting them to net-zero by 2050 -- an ambitious task that scientists, financiers, negotiators, and activists at COP26 are debating how to achieve and pay for.But what is the difference between 1.5°C and 2°C of warming? We asked several scientists to explain:Where are we now?Already, the world has heated to around 1.1°C above pre-industrial levels. Each of the last four decades was hotter than any decade since 1850."We never had such a global warming in only a few decades", said climate scientist Daniela Jacob at the Climate Service Center Germany. "Half a degree means much more extreme weather, and it can be more often, more intense, or extended in duration."Just this year, torrential rains flooded China and Western Europe, killing hundreds of people. Hundreds more died when temperatures in the Pacific Northwest hit record highs. Greenland saw massive melting events, wildfires ravaged the Mediterranean and Siberia, and record drought-hit parts of Brazil."Climate change is already affecting every inhabited region across the globe," said climate scientist Rachel Warren at the University of East Anglia.Heat, rain, droughtMore warming to 1.5°C and beyond will worsen such impacts."For every increment of global warming, changes in extremes become larger," said climate scientist Sonia Seneviratne at ETH Zurich.For example, heatwaves would become both more frequent and more severe.An extreme heat event that occurred once per decade in a climate without human influence, would happen 4.1 times a decade at 1.5°C of warming, and 5.6 times at 2°C, according to the U.N. climate science panel (IPCC).Let warming spiral to 4°C, and such an event could occur 9.4 times per decade.A warmer atmosphere can also hold more moisture, resulting in more extreme rainfall that raises flood risks. It also increases evaporation, leading to more intense droughts.Ice, seas, coral reefsThe difference between 1.5°C and 2°C is critical for Earth's oceans and frozen regions."At 1.5°C, there’s a good chance we can prevent most of Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheet from collapsing," said climate scientist Michael Mann at Pennsylvania State University.That would help limit sea-level rise to a few feet by the end of the century - still, a big change that would erode coastlines and inundate some small island states and coastal cities.But blow past 2°C and the ice sheets could collapse, Mann said, with sea levels rising up to 10 meters (30 feet)- though how quickly that could happen is uncertain.Warming of 1.5°C would destroy at least 70% of coral reefs, but at 2°C more than 99% would be lost. That would destroy fish habitats and communities that rely on reefs for their food and livelihoods.Food, forests, diseaseWarming of 2°C, versus 1.5°C, would also increase the impact on food production."If you have crop failures in a couple of the breadbaskets of the world at the same time, then you could see extreme food price spikes and hunger and famine across wide swathes of the world," said climate scientist Simon Lewis at University College London.A warmer world could see the mosquitoes that carry diseases such as malaria and dengue fever expand across a wider range. But 2°C would also see a bigger share of insects and animals lose most of their habitat range, compared with 1.5°C, and increase the risk of forest fires - another risk to wildlife.“Tipping points”As the world heats up, the risk increases that the planet will reach "tipping points", where Earth’s systems cross a threshold that triggers irreversible or cascading impacts. Exactly when those points would be reached is uncertain.Droughts, reduced rainfall, and continued destruction of the Amazon through deforestation, for example, could see the rainforest system collapse, releasing CO2 into the atmosphere rather than storing it. Or warming Arctic permafrost could cause long-frozen biomass to decompose, releasing a vast amount of carbon emissions."That's why it's so risky to keep emitting from fossil fuels ... because we're increasing the likelihood that we go over one of those tipping points," Lewis said.Beyond 2°CSo far, the climate pledges that countries have submitted to the United Nations' registry of pledges put the world on track for 2.7°C of warming. The International Energy Agency said Thursday https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/net-zero-methane-pledges-push-world-near-paris-climate-goal-iea-2021-11-04 that new promises announced at the COP26 summit - if implemented - could hold warming to below 1.8°C, although some experts challenged that calculation. It remains to be seen whether those promises will translate into real-world action.Warming of 2.7°C would deliver "unliveable heat" for parts of the year across areas of the tropics and subtropics. Biodiversity would be enormously depleted, food security would drop, and extreme weather would exceed most urban infrastructure's capacity to cope, scientists said."If we can keep warming below 3°C we likely remain within our adaptive capacity as a civilization, but at 2.7°C warmings we would experience great hardship," said Mann.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explainer-the-difference-between-1-5-c-and-2-c-of-global-warming-101636265839638.html
07-11-2021||World||Canadian firm snaps ties with supplier from China over use of North Korean labour||A major Canadian apparel company has cancelled a contract with a Chinese supplier and removed products from that source after a media expose showed that it was using forced North Korean labour.The story was broken by broadcaster CBC, which, through undercover investigations, showed that the Dandong Huayang Textiles and Garment Co, was using North Korean “guest” workers, who worked under distressing conditions, potentially under a pilot project approved by Beijing in 2014.The Canadian company, Reitmans, which has over 400 outlets in the country under multiple brands, issued a statement saying that it decided to “proactively stop issuing new business purchase orders with this supplier” at the end of 2020 and also decided to “pull all remaining inventory” of the styles originating from this supplier.It added, “We are shaken by these new allegations about the presence of North Korean guest workers in what appears to be Dandong Huayang Textiles and Garments Ltd factories.”The factory in question has refuted the allegation it was using “illegal workers”, according to CBC, in a televised report. The outlet also quoted experts as saying that using such labour was common practice in the city of Dandong, which lies close to the China-North Korea border.It also said that using such labour could be in violation of a United Nations Security Council sanctions from 2017 that banned employing North Korean migrant labour and ordered their repatriation over concerns their earnings were helping to “to support” Pyongyang’s “prohibited nuclear and ballistic missile programmes”.Reitmans, which is headquartered in Montreal, announced it will donate the unused clothing from the Chinese supplier to local charities.This isn’t the first time that use of forced labour in Chinese factories has become an issue for a Canadian company as there has been criticism and condemnation of goods sourced from Xinjiang, where China has been accused of running alleged concentration camp-like facilities for the ethnic Uighur population.Such reports led to the Canadian government announcing a policy this January “advancing measures to address the risk of forced labour from any country from entering Canadian and global supply chains and to protect Canadian businesses from becoming unknowingly complicit”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-firm-snaps-ties-with-chinese-supplier-over-use-of-north-korean-labour-101636263163912.html

The country’s leader, Kim Jong Un, didn’t watch the drill, although Pak Jong Chon, a member of the Presidium of the Political Bureau, inspected the fire competition, the state media reported. Much of North Korea’s artillery forces are deployed along the border with South Korea and are aimed at the South’s capital, home of about 10 million people and located about 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the border. The US and South Korea conducted a five-day joint air defense exercise from Monday that involved some 200 aircraft, South Korea’s Yonhap news agency reported. North Korea has claimed that the international community has a double standard, and only criticizes Pyongyang’s military drills.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-s-mechanised-troops-conduct-artillery-fire-drill-101636252996929.html

What we know so far||Iraq's Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi survived an assassination attempt early on Sunday when his residence in Baghdad was hit in an apparent drone attack, the country's officials said, adding that al-Kadhimi was unharmed in the strike and is believed to be in good health. It was the military that described the strike as an “assassination attempt” and, in an official statement released moments later, said the security forces are taking all necessary measures in connection with this “failed attempt”.What we know so farThe attack on the Iraqi prime minister's residence was carried out by an armed drone laden with explosives, according to the statement from the country's military.Two Iraqi officials told the Associated Press, on the condition of anonymity (since they were not authorised to give out official statements) that seven of prime minister al-Kadhimi's guards were injured in the attack. The officials said the drone strike actually took place in the Green Zone, a heavily fortified region in Baghdad.The Iraqi government statement, released by the state-run media moments after news of the drone strike broke, also confirmed that the failed assassination attempt was with “an explosives-laden drone” that tried to target al-Kadhimi's residence in the Green Zone.As far as the residents of Baghdad are concerned, no reports of injuries have arrived so far. The Associated Press stated that residents of the city heard the sound of an explosion, followed by gunfire, from the general direction of the Green Zone on early Sunday morning, shortly before news of the drone strike broke. Western diplomats based in the Green Zone, which houses government buildings and foreign embassies, also told the Reuters news agency that they heard explosions and gunfire in the area.Who is behind the attack?It is not immediately clear who is behind the attack on the residence, nor has any group claimed responsibility yet.The drone strike, however, comes amid a stand-off between security forces and heavily armed Shia militias aligned with Iran. In recent weeks, these pro-Iran groups have staged demonstrations near the Green Zone, protesting against the results of a general election last month which dealt a blow to their parliamentary power.One of these protests on Friday had even turned deadly when the demonstrators, having already rejected the results of the elections in which they were the biggest losers, marched toward the Green Zone and exchanged fire with security forces posted there. One of the protesters died in the resulting crossfire, news agencies reported, adding that dozens of security forces were also injured. Following the clashes, al-Kadhimi had ordered an investigation to determine which side initiated the conflict and who violated orders not to open fire.Why are the election results being contested?Although the United States and the UN Security Council (UNSC) have praised the October 10 election, which was mostly violence-free and without major technical glitches, unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud have cast a shadow over the vote.The election, which was held months ahead of schedule in response to mass protests in late 2019, saw the biggest gains made by influential Shia cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, who won the largest number of parliament seats – 73 out of 329. While he maintains good relations with Iran, al-Sadr publicly opposes external interference in Iraq's affairs.However, pro-Iran militia supporters claim mass voter fraud took place in the elections, an assertion that has not yet been substantiated with verifiable evidence. The standoff with the militia supporters has also increased tensions among rival Shia factions that could reflect on the street and threaten Iraq's newfound relative stability. These factions have also protested against the heavy-handed interference of neighbouring Iran in Iraq's affairs through Iran-backed militias.The militias lost some popularity since the 2018 vote when they made big election gains. Many hold them responsible for suppressing the 2019 protests and for challenging the state's authority. The protests appeared to be aimed at pressuring al-Sadr to ensure that Iran-aligned factions are part of the next cabinet. As the winner, al-Sadr's bloc will seek coalition partners and name the prime minister. (With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iraq-pm-mustafa-al-kadhimi-survives-drone-attack-at-residence-what-we-know-so-far-101636249667560.html

07-11-2021||World||Brazil: 21 scientists reject prestigious medals in row with Bolsonaro||Twenty-one scientists awarded one of Brazil's highest honors, the National Order of Scientific Merit, rejected their medals Saturday after President Jair Bolsonaro withdrew two colleagues whose work apparently discomfited his government from the list of honorees.The far-right president named 25 people Wednesday to receive the honor, which Brazil created in 1992 to recognize the most important contributions to science and technology.However, two days later, he withdrew the names of two prominent scientists from the list.One was Dr. Marcus Lacerda, who published one of the first studies finding the drug chloroquine is ineffective against Covid-19 -- rebutting Bolsonaro's pet strategy for fighting the pandemic.The other was Dr. Adele Benzaken, who was fired as director of the Brazilian health ministry's HIV/AIDS department when Bolsonaro took office in 2019 after her department published a pamphlet aimed at transgender men.In protest, all 20 of the other scientists and one of the three "national personalities" named by Bolsonaro to receive the honor rejected their medals in an open letter."This is yet another clear demonstration of the persecution of scientists and the latest step in the current government's systematic attack on science and technology," they said."This act of protest, which saddens us, expresses our indignation at the destruction of Brazil's university system and of science and technology in general."Bolsonaro has faced sharp criticism from the scientific community over budget cuts for research and technology, as well as his frequent rejection of scientific findings and history of spreading misinformation, particularly on Covid-19.The president long touted chloroquine as a treatment for Covid-19 despite evidence it was ineffective, and flouted health experts' advice on face masks and stay-at-home measures to contain the pandemic.Benzaken, the director of leading public health institute Fiocruz in the Amazon region, said she was "extremely honored" by her colleagues' decision to reject their medals over what she called the government's "inelegant" treatment of her and Lacerda."That was the greatest honor of all," she told AFP, criticizing the Bolsonaro government's attitude toward science."There have been heavy cuts to funding for science in Brazil, a total disregard for statements based on scientific evidence, little value attributed to science," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-21-scientists-reject-prestigious-medals-in-row-with-bolsonaro-101636248993315.html

Minutes later the chaos was declared a "mass casualty incident.""It happened all at once. It seemed like it just happened... over the course of just a few minutes," said Houston Police Executive Assistant Chief Larry Satterwhite, who was at the front of the event when the situation began.Satterwhite said he immediately met with promoters and they agreed to halt the show. Officials said the concert was brought to an end by 10:10 p.m.Finner said that among the "narratives" under review by police were reports suggesting "some individual was injecting other people with drugs."One report involved a security officer "who felt a prick in his neck" as he was trying to restrain or grab someone and then fell unconscious, only to be revived with a dose of the opioid antidote naloxone, Finner said, citing an account from medical personnel who treated the officer.Finner said the medical staff also noticed what appeared to be a needle mark on the officer's neck.It was not clear whether authorities suspected such an episode played a role in the crowd surge, but Finner said, "we're going to get down to the bottom of it."Police were awaiting autopsies to determine the causes of death, but said some victims were trampled.City Fire Chief Samuel Peña said it appeared the venue had ample exit routes for fans and that none was obstructed.Twenty-five people were taken to hospitals by ambulance after the crush began, some of them in cardiac arrest, with 13 still hospitalized on Saturday - five under age 18 - following the discharge of four patients, Mayor Sylvester Turner told reporters. Eight people died. Most ranged in age from 14 to 27, though one victim's age was not immediately known, Turner said.'It felt like a riot'After mobbing entrance gates and merchandise booths early in the day, the crowd grew increasingly unruly as performers took the stage, according to 19-year-old festivalgoer Hamad Al Barrak."There were just too many people,' said Al Barrak, who described chaos as he tried to buy festival gear. "We were all pressed together. You felt like you couldn't breathe."Albert Merza, 43, part of a group of eight people from Detroit attending the festival, recounted seeing "a lot of drinking and crazy behavior.""It felt like a riot," he said, adding that it appeared about half the crowd were under age 21. "There were people throwing out stuff, objects flying everywhere."Nick Johnson, 17, said he witnessed a steady rise of disruptive behavior before the stampede."It was going on for over two hours, and it just got worse and worse," he said.An incident earlier in the day in which fans started "rushing" the festival gates was brought under control relatively quickly, said Finner, the police chief, adding it appeared unrelated to the deadly stampede.Finner said police had 528 officers assigned to the festival on Friday, along with 755 private security personnel.Throughout the day, 25 arrests were made - one each for marijuana possession and public intoxication and the rest for trespassing, Finner said. Three-hundred people were treated at an on-site medical clinic for various injuries and illnesses, including several apparent drug overdoses, according to Peña.The venue could have held up to 200,000, but organizers limited the crowd to 50,000, based on ticket sales, Peña said.'Absolutely devastated'Houston-born Scott said he was "absolutely devastated" and vowed to support the police as they investigate.""My prayers go out to the families and all those impacted," Scott wrote on Twitter.Peña described how the crush of fans quickly overwhelmed the private medical personnel for the festival, a two-day affair that was scheduled to culminate on Saturday https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/deadly-texas-concert-crush-who-is-travis-scott-what-is-astroworld-2021-11-06, but was canceled after Friday night's tragedy.Videos posted to social media showed pandemonium as fans and staff tried to bring attention to injured concertgoers. One video showed fans attempting to make camera operators aware of the dangerous situation. Another video showed people waving toward the stage and chanting "Stop the show!"The investigation is likely to focus on security and safety protocols. Two weeks ago, another Houston concert was canceled after fans pushed into a Playboi Carti show being held within the same NRG Park complex.Jennifer Ortega, 22, who arrived at Friday's event at about 1 p.m. said access was orderly at that time. But by 4 p.m. the crowd at the smaller of the festival's two stages "got pretty reckless," with people throwing water bottles. She said she saw about three people leaving the area with bloody noses and missing teeth.Organizers said they were cooperating with police."We are focused on supporting local officials however we can," Astroworld Fest, an event organized by Live Nation Entertainment, said on Twitter.Scott stopped multiple times during his 75-minute performance when he spotted fans in distress and asked security to ensure their safety, video posted online showed. Emergency vehicles, lights and alarms flashing, cut through the audience several times."We need somebody to help. Somebody passed out right here," Scott said, according to video of his set, which included a guest appearance by Canadian rapper Drake. "Security, somebody, jump in here real quick."Another video clip showed police performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation on several people even as music blared in the background.The tragedy harkens back to a 1979 concert by British rock band The Who in which 11 people were killed when fans stampeded into the Riverfront Coliseum in Cincinnati before the event.Scott, who came to fame in the early 2010s for his unique vocal style has a daughter with Kylie Jenner from the famed Kardashian family. Astroworld is also the name of his third studio album released in 2018 to critical acclaim.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/criminal-probe-launched-into-stampede-at-astroworld-concert-that-left-8-dead-101636244829150.html

The wooden chest held metal and fabric objects that seem to be part of the harnesses of the chariot horses, and a chariot shaft was found resting on one of the beds.Pompeii was buried in ash when Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79 AD, killing those who hadn’t managed to leave the city in time. They were either crushed by collapsing buildings or killed by thermal shock.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pompeii-dig-yields-rare-window-into-daily-life-of-enslaved-101636238762332.html

A burnt human body and the blackened shells of several cars and motorbikes dotted the road in the eastern Freetown suburb of Wellington, where hundreds had gathered.The manager of the central state morgue in Freetown said it had received 91 bodies following the blast. More than 100 casualties have been admitted to hospitals and clinics across the capital, deputy health minister Amara Jambai told Reuters.The country’s vice-president said earlier on Saturday that at least 92 people were killed in the massive explosion.“We have received a report this morning that 92 people have died,” Mohamed Juldeh Jalloh said from the scene in an official confirmation of the toll, adding that 88 more were in hospital being treated for severe burns.“We’ve got so many casualties, burnt corpses,” said Brima Bureh Sesay, head of the national disaster management agency, in a video from the scene shared online. “It’s a terrible, terrible accident.”Videos shared online shortly after the explosion showed people running through clouds of thick smoke as large fires lit up the night sky. Reuters was not able immediately to verify the images.According to witnesses, the blast happened when a vehicle caught fire at a petrol station after a road accident. The flames then spread, burning people in cars and on roads nearby.The majority of the victims were street vendors and motorcyclists, many of whom were caught in the blaze while trying to retrieve fuel, according to volunteer worker Jusu Jacka Yorma who was at the scene.Hundreds of people gathered on Saturday morning, many searching for missing relatives under the eye of security forces.Video footage showed a burnt-out tanker and a truck, and the surrounding area littered with husks of vehicles, some still smouldering.“Deeply disturbed by the tragic fires and the horrendous loss of life,” President Julius Maada Bio wrote on Twitter.“My profound sympathies with families who have lost loved ones and those who have been maimed as a result. My government will do everything to support affected families.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dozens-killed-in-sierra-leone-fuel-tanker-blast-101636238065368.html

The stock, which surged 74% this year to a record on Thursday, closed 0.6% lower at $1,222.09 on Friday.The number of shares Musk could be set to offload based on the Twitter poll is equivalent to 80% of the average daily trading volume for Tesla in the past three months. As of 5:09 p.m. in New York, more than 55% of the 846,378 users who had voted supported Musk selling his shares. The poll will end around 3 p.m. on Sunday. Musk, the world’s richest person known for his tongue-in-cheek tweets, cited recent discussion of the wealthy hoarding unrealized gains to avoid paying taxes.The amount of Tesla stock Musk may potentially sell would be even greater if his options are included. “We are witnessing the Twitter masses deciding the outcome of a $25B coin flip,” venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya said in response to Musk’s tweet. Saturday’s tweet marks the second time within a week that Musk has discussed selling Tesla shares. On Sunday, he challenged a United Nations official who said just a small percentage of the billionaire’s wealth could help solve world hunger. He wrote that he would sell Tesla stock if the World Food Programme could describe the accounting on his Twitter thread. “Looking forward to the day when the richest person in the world paying some tax does not depend on a Twitter poll,” University of California at Berkeley economist Gabriel Zucman said in a tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/should-i-sell-10-of-my-tesla-stock-musk-takes-twitter-poll-101636235338975.html

Wu did not name neighbouring India, but health officials have said all the recent outbreaks in China have been caused by the Delta variant of Covid, which was first detected in India earlier this year.The strict policy will continue despite China having fully vaccinated nearly 76% of its 1.4 billion population against Covid. It has administered 1.072 billion vaccines until Friday, the NHC said.A total of 37.97 million people in China have also received a third booster dose of the vaccine as of Friday, Wu said, adding that 2.3 billion doses of Covid vaccines had been administered by day’s end on Friday, an increase of about 8.9 million from the previous day.China is currently scrambling to control the latest Covid-19 outbreak, which has spread to 44 cities in 20 provinces and resulted in 918 confirmed infections since October 17. The outbreak is driven by the more transmissible Delta variant.Since the initial epidemic in the central Chinese city of Wuhan last year, at least 30 smaller outbreaks have been recorded.The numbers of infections are small but China has responded to the outbreaks with strict lockdowns, mass nucleic acid testing and intra-provincial travel restrictions.“Real-world practices have shown that our disease control strategy fits the condition of the country and is science-based. The strategy has also balanced disease control requests and development of society and economy,” top health official Wu said.The Chinese mainland on Friday reported 40 new locally transmitted Covid-19 cases, the NHC said in its daily report on Saturday. Of the new local cases, 16 were reported in Heilongjiang; nine in Hebei; three each in Liaoning, Henan and Sichuan; two each in Yunnan and Gansu; and one each in Inner Mongolia and Jiangxi.Mainland China has reported 97,660 coronavirus cases so far, with 4,636 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-continue-covid-19-curbs-amid-overseas-outbreaks-top-health-official-101636200804840.html
