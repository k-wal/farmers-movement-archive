This is called revaccination," Putin said at a meeting with the deputy director of the Gamaleya Research Centre for Epidemiology and Microbiology, which developed both vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-revaccinated-against-covid-19-report-101637513814477.html
21-11-2021||World||Iran's Mahan Air says hit by cyberattack||Iran's second-largest airline, Mahan Air, said it had been hit by a cyberattack Sunday, the latest of several targeting the company."Mahan Air's computer system has suffered a new attack," the company said in a statement."It has already been the target on several occasions due to its important position in the country's aviation industry."All of its flights were on schedule, the statement added, but the company's website was down."Our internet security team is thwarting the cyberattack," spokesman Amir-Hossein Zolanvari told state television.According to Mehr news agency, some Mahan customers had received text messages that said: "Cyberattack against Mahan for complicity in the crimes committed by the terrorist Guardians Corps" -- a reference to Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards.Mahan Air is Iran's main private airline and the second biggest after the national carrier Iran Air.It has been on the blacklist of Iranian companies targeted by US sanctions since 2011.In addition to a domestic network, it also serves destinations in Europe and Asia.Iran last month accused Israel and the US of a cyberattack on its petrol distribution system that caused havoc at fuel pumps nationwide.Israel's internet infrastructure has meanwhile been hit by cyberattacks by the Black Shadow hacking group, including against the largest Israeli LGBTQ dating site and an insurance firm.The hacking group has not acknowledged any link to Iran, but the attacks are widely seen as part of a years-long covert war between Israel and Iran including physical attacks on ships and offensive cyber moves online.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/irans-mahan-air-says-hit-by-cyberattack-101637508727784.html
21-11-2021||World||Covid-19 highlights a geographic split in Germany||Analysis of Germany's latest Covid-19 figures shows that infections are soaring where the vaccination rate is lower than the national average. Many of the districts with the highest infection rates are in the eastern states of Saxony and Thuringia, and more recently Brandenburg.But even in Bavaria — where the vaccination rate is only slightly lower than the national average — there are hot spots. Bordering Austria, which was affected by the pandemic earlier than Germany, Bavaria dealt with higher than average numbers at the beginning of the pandemic, and that is still the case.Vaccination roll-out has been most successful in the northern city-state of Bremen, where nearly 80% of the population has been vaccinated thanks to coordinated efforts to reach out to citizens.Limited education, right-wing inclinationCan a lack of willingness to be vaccinated be put down to a lack of education or to a certain political ideology? Heike Klüver, of the Institute for Social Sciences at the Humboldt University in Berlin, published a study into Germans' willingness of Germans to be vaccinated, based on a representative group of 20,500 people surveyed in March 2021. Some 67% of those asked were already vaccinated or willing to be, 17% were undecided and 16% rejected being vaccinated altogether."We see a significant correlation between education and rejection of vaccination. The lower the level of education, the higher the rejection," Klüver told DW. "The people who reject vaccination are more likely to be voters for the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party and more likely to have held right-wing positions. In addition, these are people who have low trust in politics, the government, the media, and the health-care system as a whole."Previously against immigration, now against vaccinationMany people who oppose vaccination against the coronavirus appear to share political views on other matters too. "We see relatively clear skepticism when it comes to migration," says Klüver. "As early as March, we could see that these anti-vaxxers did not adhere to mask or social distancing rules." The lack of social distancing also contributed to driving up infections in the AfD's strongholds in the eastern states.The group opposing vaccination has long had a common spirit, according to Josef Holnburger of the CeMAS research group. CeMAS, short for Center for Monitoring, Analysis, and Strategy, conducts research primarily on radical right-wing issues and conspiracy narratives online and is funded by the Alfred Landecker Foundation, among others."If it becomes known that someone in this scene has been vaccinated, then that leads to indignation from others," Holnburger said. "Because it means someone is seen to have given in." He added that vaccine skepticism was being deliberately instrumentalized by right-wing groups, especially in the east. "That's surprising insofar as these are states that traditionally had a particularly high vaccination rate, for example against measles or tetanus." This was a kind of late legacy of the communist German Democratic Republic, where numerous vaccinations were mandatory, unlike in West Germany.Holnburger, like Klüver, sees a direct connection between state-rejecting, right-wing slogans and vaccination refusal. "There are people who have a closed ideological worldview, who have a different view on reality and cannot be convinced with arguments," he said. "We see that with other issues, too, with measures against climate change, for example."In Saxony and Thuringia, there is a growing number of reports that people who want to be vaccinated and doctors who administer vaccinations have become targets of verbal attacks and threats of violence. Critics of anti-coronavirus measures are also strong in Germany's south, in Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg.Most scientists and physicians agree that politicians should not let the radical opponents of vaccination stop them from taking drastic measures against the pandemic."There could be further polarization, but trust in existing institutions was already very low," says Klüver. On the other hand, a clear majority of Germans are still willing to be vaccinated and stand by most of the coronavirus measures, even the painful ones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-highlights-a-geographic-split-in-germany-101637505505489.html
21-11-2021||World||Chileans vote in fourth presidential election in 18 months||Chileans began voting Sunday in their fourth election in 18 months, this time to choose a new president among seven candidates, with the winner overseeing the drafting of the country's first post-dictatorship constitution.The election marks the most wide open contest since the 1990s, and may well buck Chile's traditional political cycle, with the two favorites not among the established coalitions that have governed for the past three decades.Following a campaign scarred by two years of intense social protests, outgoing President Sebastian Pinera was the first public figure to cast his ballot, at a school in the affluent Santiago neighborhood of Las Condes."All opinions matter. Come and vote," he said before television cameras. "We are capable of resolving our differences in a peaceful way, by voting."The poll comes with many Chileans in revolt against deep-rooted inequality, and it follows recent elections for a body that will write the new constitution -- a key demand of the protesters.That ballot, in May, saw voters massively reject traditional political parties in charge since democracy replaced the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet 31 years ago.On Sunday, seven hopefuls vie to replace the unpopular Pinera, covering the entire political spectrum.The favorites are Gabriel Boric, 35, of the leftist Approve Dignity alliance which includes the Communist Party, and far right candidate Jose Antonio Kast, 55, of the Republican Party -- each with about a quarter of stated voter intention.Both are from minority parties not in government.Centrists, including the candidate from Pinera's party, proved the least popular in opinion polls that also revealed half of the 15 million eligible voters to be undecided."I'm going to vote but I am pretty disappointed," said Danilo Panes. The 26-year-old took part in 2019 protests and feels none of the candidates have put forward "alternatives in line with what the people demanded" when they took to the streets.High inequalityThe demonstrators denounced low salaries and pensions, poor public health care and education, and in the words of a recent OECD report, "persistently high inequality" between rich and poor.This situation was largely blamed on the Pinochet-era constitution, which pundits say has made the country rich through its promotion of private enterprise in all spheres, but at the expense of the poor and working classes.Dozens of people died in weeks of protests in 2019 that marked Chile's worst social crisis in decades.The government finally agreed to a referendum, which one year later saw about 80 percent of voters give the go-ahead for a new constitution to be drawn up by an elected body.Voters in May elected a majority of independent candidates, mainly left-leaning, to that body, which has already started drafting the document.Chileans also vote to replace the 155-member Chamber of Deputies and almost two-thirds of Senators for a new-look Congress that will be in place when the country decides in a mandatory referendum next year whether to adopt the new constitution.It is not known how, or if, a changed constitution could impact on the terms or powers of the president.But the fact that Kast and Boric, a former student leader, are the favorites signals an upending of political norms."It can be argued that these are the last elections of the old cycle, since they may end with a different result to the ones that came before," University of Santiago political scientist Raul Elgueta told AFP.Also competing are Christian Democrat senator Yasna Provoste, the only candidate who has served in the center-left coalition that ruled for 20 years after the dictatorship; far-left professor Eduardo Artes; and filmmaker and progressive politician Marco Enriquez-Ominami.'A difficult period'With his second, non-consecutive term beset by economic and social upheaval, billionaire Pinera approaches the end of his mandate with record-low approval.The country's economic woes have worsened with the coronavirus epidemic, with unemployment up, inflation at six percent and foreign debt skyrocketing as the demand for social aid and subsidies exploded.One thing is clear: a large proportion of Chileans want a more interventionist and socially-minded government, better access to public health care and education and changes to the pension system, which is privately administered.Analysts have also observed a recent rightward swing blamed partly on sometimes violent and arsonist actions by protesters, but also on growing concerns about immigration and crime.To win in the first round, a candidate must garner 50 percent of votes cast, but analysts believe the election will likely go to a runoff round between the top two contenders on December 19.Polls remain open until 6:00 pm (2100 GMT), with results expected late Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chileans-vote-in-fourth-presidential-election-in-18-months-101637504632009.html
21-11-2021||World||28 detained in Netherlands as protests against Covid norms enter second night: Report||As protests against Covid-19-induced restrictions entered a second night on Sunday, at least five cops were injured and 28 people detained across the Netherlands, reported Reuters.According to the report, the Dutch authorities also resorted to using water cannons, dogs and deployed police to stop the youths from rioting. The protests are being touted as one of the worst disturbances since a full lockdown led to widespread disorder and more than 500 arrests in January.The unrest began on Friday after police opened fire on a crowd during a protest in Rotterdam. At least three people were believed to be hit by police bullets and were later admitted to a hospital.What sparked the protests?The protests were sparked by opposition to government plans to restrict use of a national corona pass to people who have either recovered from Covid-19 or have been vaccinated, excluding those with a negative test result.The protests are also being held against the reimposition of lockdown in the Netherlands in an effort to slow a resurgence of the virus.Also read | Rotterdam police open fire as protest over Covid curbs turns violentBesides, the ban on a New Year's Eve firework to avoid added pressure on hospitals also angered the youths.On Saturday night, at least five officers were injured in The Hague, police statement said.About Saturday protestPolice carried out charges on horseback and arrested 19 people, one of them for throwing a rock through the window of a passing ambulance. Further, two Eredivisie league soccer matches, which have been closed to the public under the tougher Covid-19 restrictions, were briefly disrupted on Saturday night as small groups of fans forced their way into the stadiums and threw fireworks.Another 13 arrests were reported by police in two towns in the southern province of Limburg, while disturbances were also reported in the northern province of Flevoland on Saturday. Eight people were detained in the town of Urk, where a Covid-19 testing station was torched earlier this year.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/28-detained-in-netherlands-as-protests-against-covid-norms-enter-second-night-report-101637501072332.html
21-11-2021||World||Sudan's military agrees to reinstate ousted PM Abdalla Hamdok: Report||A deal was reached between Sudan's military and civilian leaders to reinstate Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, who was deposed in a coup last month, military and government officials said Sunday.They also said that government officials and politicians arrested since the Oct. 25 coup will be released as part of the deal between the military and political parties, including the largest Umma Party. However, the party later issued a statement implying that it did not sign off on the deal.Hamdok will lead an independent technocratic Cabinet, the officials said. They said the U.N., the U.S. and others played “crucial roles” in crafting the agreement. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the deal before the official announcement.The coup, more than two years after a popular uprising forced the removal of longtime autocrat Omar al-Bashir and his Islamist government, has drawn international criticism. The United States, its allies and the United Nations have condemned the use of excessive force against anti-coup protesters.Sudanese have been taking to the streets in masses since the military takeover, which upended the country’s fragile transition to democracy. The agreement comes just days after doctors said at least 15 people were killed by live fire during anti-coup demonstrations.The military has tightened its grip on power, appointing a new, military-run Sovereign Council. The council is chaired by coup leader Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan.The Sovereign Council will meet later Sunday before announcing the deal, the officials said.A national initiative formed after the coup that includes political parties and public figures said in a statement that Hamdok would be reinstated and will form a technocratic Cabinet. It said the deal would be signed later Sunday along with a political declaration. It did not elaborate.However, the Umma Party released a statement stressing its opposition to any deal that fails to “meet the aspirations of all revolutionaries and the Sudanese people.”“The party expresses its faith in the victorious and rebellious resistance and reaffirms that it shall always stand by the people to protect justice,” it said.Also, the Forces for the Declaration of Freedom and Change, the group that spearheaded the uprising that culminated in al-Bashir's ouster, objected to any deals with the military.In a statement Sunday, the group reiterated its opposition to any new political partnership with the military, insisting the perpetrators of the coup should be brought to justice.“We are not concerned with any agreements with this brute junta and we are employing all peaceful and creative methods to bring it down,” the statement said.Meanwhile, thousands took to the streets in the capital of Khartoum on Sunday to denounce the coup and demand the immediate transfer of power to civilians. Protesters waved the Sudanese flag and chanted “Power is to the people! The military are to stay in the barracks.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sudans-military-agrees-to-reinstate-ousted-pm-abdalla-hamdok-report-101637497810307.html
21-11-2021||World||Singapore, India to resume daily flights under Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL)||Singapore said on Sunday it has reached an agreement with India on resuming commercial flights under the Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) facility that will commence with six daily flights from Chennai, Delhi and Mumbai on November 29. The city state began discussions with Indian authorities last week for a temporary arrangement for partial resumption of commercial flights between the two sides following the launch of VTL for quarantine-free travel for fully vaccinated travellers. Singapore high commissioner Simon Wong tweeted that joint efforts by the lead agencies of both sides resulted in the resumption of commercial flights. Travellers from India can apply for a Vaccinated Travel Pass (VTP) from November 22, he said. VTL travellers must be fully vaccinated and present a digital proof of vaccination. They must also take two Covid-19 tests – a pre-departure test within two days before departing for Singapore, and an on-arrival test at Changi airport, following which they have to remain self-isolated until the result is confirmed to be negative. External affairs minister S Jaishankar, who was in Singapore last week, had tweeted on November 17 that he had discussed enhancing travel arrangements between the two countries at a meeting with Singapore’s transport minister S Iswaran. The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) said in a statement it “reached an agreement with the Ministry of Civil Aviation of India on the resumption of scheduled commercial passenger flights”. “This will facilitate quarantine-free travel on the Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) from India to Singapore, which will start from 29 November 2021 with six designated VTL flights daily from Chennai, Delhi and Mumbai,” it said. Airlines can also operate non-VTL flights between India and Singapore, and travellers on these flights will be subject to certain public health requirements, including a Covid-19 test two days before departure and serving a seven-day “Stay-Home Notice (SHN)” at the place of residence, a hotel or a serviced apartment. The airlines will announce the schedules for VTL and non-VTL flights when ready. People familiar with developments said the arrangement with Singapore will be on the lines of an air bubble. India currently has air bubble arrangements with 30 countries. According to the CAAS statement, short-term visitors and long-term pass holders will need to apply for a Vaccinated Travel Pass (VTP) to enter Singapore under the VTL. Applications for VTP for both categories of visitors from India, Malaysia, Indonesia, Finland and Sweden will open on November 22. “CAAS understands that travellers are looking forward to the launch of the VTL and would like to assure travellers that there is no need to rush to apply for the VTP,” the statement said. VTPs will initially be issued to those who intend to travel to Singapore from November 29, 2021 to January 21, 2022. Those who intend to enter Singapore after December 1 were encouraged to apply after November 24. Short-term visitors were advised to obtain a visa after receiving VTP approval. They must also purchase travel insurance, with a minimum coverage of S$30,000 for Covid-19-related medical treatment and hospitalisation costs. In Singapore, these visitors must also use the Trace Together app to facilitate contact tracing. Currently, the only flights from Singapore allowed to carry passengers to India are flights under the Vande Bharat Mission (VBM). Since these are chartered repatriation flights, they could not be designated as VTL flights. Singapore started the VTL mechanism on September 8 with two countries – Brunei and Germany. It now has VTL arrangements with 13 countries, including Australia, the UK and the US. VTLs for India, Finland, Indonesia, Malaysia and Sweden will become operational from November 29, and similar arrangements for Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) will begin from December 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-india-to-resume-daily-flights-under-vaccinated-travel-lane-vtl-101637497957862.html
21-11-2021||World||Singapore to operate 6 daily flights from India from November 29 under Vaccinated Travel Lane programme||Singapore is set to resume scheduled commercial passenger flights from India under its Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) starting November 29, after both the countries reached an agreement.The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), in a statement on Sunday, said that it will facilitate quarantine-free travel from India, with at least six designated flights daily from Chennai, Delhi and Mumbai.“Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) has reached an agreement with India's Ministry of Civil Aviation on the resumption of scheduled commercial passenger flights between Singapore and India,” news agency ANI quoted the Singapore's civil aviation authority as saying.“It'll facilitate quarantine-free travel on Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) from India to Singapore, which will start from November 29, 2021, with six designated VTL flights daily from Chennai, Delhi and Mumbai. Airlines can also operate non-VTL flights between India and Singapore,” the aviation regulator added.Applications for Vaccinated Travel Passes (VTP) for short-term visitors and long-term pass holders from India will start on November 22 at 6pm Singapore time, ANI reported. "All short-term visitors and long-term pass holders who meet the requirements of the VTL will receive a VTP," the agency further said.Airlines can also operate non-VTL flights between India and Singapore, although passengers on non-VTL flights will be subject to the prevailing public health requirements, the CAAS further informed."CAAS understands that travellers are looking forward to the launch of the VTL and would like to assure travellers that there is no need to rush to apply for the VTP," the authority said.The authority also urged short-term visitors and long-term pass holders to apply for a VTP to enter Singapore under the VTL, ANI reported, citing CNA.To facilitate the application process, VTP applicants should have their passport and digital proof of vaccination ready. They should also know the address of the place they intend to self-isolate themselves while waiting for the results of their on-arrival COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, the CAAS release said.Travellers who require a visa for travel to Singapore should apply for it separately and only after their VTP is approved, CAAS said."They must also purchase travel insurance, with a minimum coverage of Singapore USD 30,000 for Covid-19-related medical treatment and hospitalisation costs, prior to travel to Singapore. In Singapore, these visitors must also use the TraceTogether app to facilitate contact tracing," the authority added.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/6-daily-commercial-flights-from-india-to-singapore-from-november-29-101637487130085.html
21-11-2021||World||Palestinian kills 1 Israeli, injures 4 others near Jerusalem: Report||A Palestinian assailant killed one Israeli and wounded four others before being fatally shot by Israeli police near the entrance to a flashpoint Jerusalem holy site Sunday, police said.Police said the violence took place near an entrance to a contested flashpoint shrine known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary. Violence surrounding the site, which is considered holy by both faiths, has triggered previous rounds of fighting between Israel and the Palestinians, most recently in May.Paramedics said one person suffered critical injuries, two suffered serious wounds, and two others were lightly injured. Jerusalem’s Hadassah hospital later said one of the injured died. The paramedics said the Palestinian attacker was confirmed dead at the scene.Police published pictures of an improvised firearm and a knife from the scene.The Hamas militant group praised the attack in a statement but stopped short of claiming responsibility, calling the incident a “heroic operation.”“Our people’s resistance will continue to be legitimate by all means and tools against the Zionist occupier until our desired goals are achieved and the occupation is expelled from our holy sites and all of our lands,” spokesman Abdel Latif al-Qanou said.Sunday’s incident was the second of its kind in Jerusalem’s historic Old City in recent days, but shootings are relatively rare. On Wednesday, a Palestinian teen was fatally shot after stabbing two Israeli border police.In that incident, the two officers were hospitalized and the teen, identified by police as a 16-year-old from east Jerusalem, was pronounced dead at the scene.Palestinians have carried out dozens of stabbing, shooting and car-ramming attacks targeting Israeli civilians and security personnel in recent years. Palestinians and rights groups contend some of the alleged car-rammings were accidents and accuse Israel of using excessive force.Israel captured east Jerusalem, including the Old City and its Christian, Muslim and Jewish holy sites, along with the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war. It later annexed east Jerusalem in a move unrecognized by most of the international community.The Palestinians seek the occupied West Bank and Gaza for a future independent state, with east Jerusalem as its capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/palestinian-kills-1-israeli-injures-4-others-near-jerusalem-report-101637484546859.html
21-11-2021||World||Relatives of Covid-19 victims question Japanese govt's 'stay-at-home policy'||Yoshihiko Takeuchi, who ran a small restaurant on the island of Okinawa, told only a few friends he had the coronavirus. When he didn't answer phone calls from public health workers for three days, police went to his home and found him dead in his bed.He was among hundreds of people who have died while subject to “jitaku ryoyo,” or a policy of having some Covid-19 patients “recuperate at home."In many countries, those with the virus stay home to isolate and recover, but critics say that in Japan, a country with one of the most affordable and accessible health care systems, people have been denied hospital care, and the policy amounted to “jitaku hochi,” or “abandonment at home.”Takeuchi's sister and a daughter of another man who died at home of Covid-19 have started an online support group for grieving relatives of such victims.Japan has seen caseloads fall dramatically in the past two months and the government has drawn up a road map to improve its pandemic response. A plan adopted Nov. 12 aims to have beds for up to 37,000 patients nationwide by the end of November, up from 28,000.That compares with more than 231,000 coronavirus patients needing hospitalization in late August, according to government data. Many had to recuperate at home.Prime Minister Fumio Kishida also promised to have health care workers routinely visit Covid-19 patients with mild symptoms at home.Public anger over inadequate treatment in the country with the world’s largest number of beds per capita is a factor driving such changes. Kishida’s predecessor, Yoshihide Suga, resigned after only a year in office, mainly because of widespread dissatisfaction with the government’s pandemic response.Speaking up takes courage in a conformist society like Japan, and class action lawsuits are rare. But Kaori Takada, Takeuchi's sister, and others in her group believe their loved ones were denied the medical care they deserved.“I had to raise my voice,” she said.She is not sure what she will do. Thousands are following the group's Twitter account and others have come forward with similar painful stories.Takada, who lives in Osaka and runs a small nursery in her home, was Takeuchi's only remaining relative. They spoke on the phone right before he was diagnosed, but he did not tell her he was sick alone at home. Given widespread phobias in Japan about Covid-19, he didn't want word to get out.Takada said he was a gentle man and much loved.“We are coming together, trying to heal, sharing how people have been treated so cruelly, and perhaps helping each other take that first step forward,” she said in a telephone interview.Japan's local public health bureaus, responsible for arranging for the care of Covid-19 patients, struggled to find hospitals that would admit them. In some cases, ambulances were shunted from one hospital to the next.A few makeshift facilities provided treatment and supplemental oxygen, but calls to set up big field hospitals went unheeded.In New York, for instance, hospitals were quickly converted, adding thousands of extra beds and ICUs for virus patients. A Navy medical ship and other facilities were turned into makeshift hospitals. At the outbreak's peak in April 2020, there were more than 1,600 new hospitalizations a day citywide.In August of this year, when infections in Japan surged with the spread of the delta variant, Japan's hospital systems were quickly declared “stretched thin,” even though it has had far fewer Covid-19 cases than the US, Europe and some other Asian and South American countries. In early September, more than 134,000 people were sick with the virus at home, according to Health Ministry records.About 18,000 Japanese have died of Covid-19-related deaths in a population of 126 million. No one knows exactly how many died at home, though the National Police Agency, which tracks deaths, said 951 people have died at home since March 2020, with 250 of them in August 2021 alone.Shigeru Omi, a top government adviser on the coronavirus and head of the Japan Community Health Care Organization, or JCHO, has urged the government to set up emergency field hospitals, specifically to avoid deaths from “jitaku ryoyo.”Japan's health care system is dominated by small, private hospitals and clinics, and few inpatient facilities are equipped to handle infectious diseases. Many beds are occupied by psychiatric patients and by the chronically ill and elderly, and there are relatively few doctors, intensive care specialists and nurses.In some places, local authorities arranged for such hospitals to accept patients who were no longer infectious and rehabilitating from serious illness after they were treated at larger hospitals. But overall, caseloads vastly outnumbered the beds available for critical care.The JCHO runs 57 of Japan's biggest hospitals. All are heavily subsidized by taxpayer money. The Health Ministry said it provided up to 100,000 yen ($900) per bed for Covid-19 patients.In October, JCHO said it had prepared 972 beds nationwide for virus patients, or fewer than 7% of its more than 14,000 overall beds, though in August it temporarily made room for about 1,800 patients.JCHO declined to comment on Kishida's call for providing thousands more beds.Dr. Takanori Yamamoto, a critical care physician at Nagoya University, believes hospital care needs to be restructured to focus on seriously ill patients in designated facilities, instead of spreading them across small hospitals that each have a handful of ICU beds.Resources were improperly managed, including widespread hospitalizations of people who didn't need it, he said. Public health bureaus are designed for research and are ill-suited to be “gatekeepers” for doling out Covid-19 care, he added.The problems are deeply rooted in a decades-old system, and Yamamoto worries that even if Japan manages to ride out this pandemic, it will be unprepared for the next one.“No other nation turned away patients like this, even countries that had far more cases. The idea of doctors not seeing patients should be out of the question. If you are a doctor, you have to take care of the sick," Yamamoto said.“Japan has done nothing. There has been no leadership," he said.The time to act is now, before another wave of coronavirus infections hits, said Dr. Kenji Shibuya, research director at the Tokyo Foundation for Policy Research, an independent think tank.“They didn’t act before, even though they knew it’s coming,” said Shibuya, who has experience working in Britain. “It is about a lack of commitment, lack of will, lack of passion to make a change at a time of crisis,” he said.Back in August, Yuko Nishizato, co-founder of Takada's group, pleaded with hospitals for her 73-year-old father to be admitted. But he died after testing positive for Covid-19 without ever getting treatment, apart from medication for a fever.Phone records show he repeatedly called the local public health center right up to his death. It breaks her heart to know all he got were recordings.“I wanted him to live to see his grandchildren. I wanted him to see a more grown-up me,” Nishizato said. “There are so many who have suffered the same way, and I don’t understand why.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/relatives-of-covid-19-victims-question-japanese-govt-s-stay-at-home-policy-101637478435325.html

They don't tell us anything," he said.Bernard Vidick, a Belgian judicial officer, said he had been refused a connecting flight in Paris because the plane bringing stranded passengers from Dublin had also been delayed."This means we are blocked in Paris whereas we should be in New York. We are wasting two of the few vacation days we have," he told Reuters.Carriers serving the United States are bracing for congestion and delays next week as the Thanksgiving holiday overlaps with airline labour shortages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/it-was-crazy-engine-failure-forces-emergency-landing-of-us-bound-flight-passengers-stranded-in-europe-101637471803031.html
21-11-2021||World||China downgrades its diplomatic ties with Lithuania over Taiwan embassy issue||China has downgraded its diplomatic relations with Lithuania after the tiny Baltic nation allowed Taiwan to open a de facto embassy in its capital earlier this week. The Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement that Beijing expressed “strong dissatisfaction” over Lithuania's move allowing the self-governed island to set up a representative office in Vilnius.Taiwan considers itself as a sovereign but Beijing claims the island under its ‘one China’ policy and has been pushing to implement the Hong Kong system there. Only a handful of countries have direct diplomatic ties with Taiwan, which Beijing calls a violation of the ‘one China’ policy.On Friday, China warned that Lithuania will “pay for what it did”.“Lithuania only has itself to blame, it will have to pay for what it did,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian told a regular news conference.Lithuania will ‘pay for what it did’, says China after it forges ties with TaiwanWhile most of the countries try to walk a diplomatic tightrope on the Taiwan issue, the United States has become increasingly vocal about the island's greater participation on international forums, especially after the beginning of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.China, meanwhile, is working to introduce legislation that would make people criminally liable for life for supporting the independence of Taiwan. China’s Taiwan Affairs Office spokesperson Zhu Fenglian said in a statement earlier this month that people named in a list of supporters of Taiwan’s independence will face sanctions.Opting for draconian measures to muzzle dissenting voices is not new for Beijing. It imposed the controversial national security law on Hong Kong last year aimed at curbing greater autonomy of the global financial hub, triggering criticism from the West.Taiwan's Premier Su Tseng-chang, parliament Speaker You Si-kun and foreign minister Joseph Wu have been named in the list drawn up by China for being "stubbornly pro-Taiwan independence."(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-downgrades-its-diplomatic-ties-with-lithuania-over-taiwan-embassy-issue-101637467776871.html

A nearly 20-minute long video shot by an activist Guan Guan shows the brutal reality of how the Xi Jinping led-government continues its atrocities on Uyghurs. The video was uploaded on YouTube in early October.Also Read| Liver on sale for $160k: Uyghur organs ‘harvested’ in China's black markets"Due to the Chinese government's restrictions, foreign journalists can hardly gain access to Xinjiang to conduct interviews," Guan said. At the start of the video, he said that the Chinese government has set up concentration camps in Xinjiang province where local ethnic minorities and dissidents are imprisoned without a trial, according to a report by Radio Free Asia.During his trip to Xinjiang, Guan travelled in a total of eight cities and discovered 18 such concentration camps, according to a report by the Daily Mail. Despite many of these camps being unmarked on maps, the activist was able to film barbed wires, guard towers, military vehicles and signs and walkways inside prison walls, the report added.In Hami in eastern Xinjiang, Guan travelled to the Hami Compulsory Isolated Drug Rehabilitation Center, which he suspects is a concentration camp. On the other hand, In Urumqi, he came across a road that had several buildings with watchtowers and high fences topped with barbed wire, the Radio Free Asia's report also said.Also Read| No food, bottlecaps to moisten lips: Ex-Chinese cop on Uyghur travel woes & moreFor years, China has denied any wrongdoing against the Uyghur community and said that the concentration camps, which the government calls re-education camps, have been set up to fight against Islamist militancy in Xinjiang. However, several human rights groups have claimed that China has been sending Uyghurs to mass detention camps, interfering in their religious practices, sterilising women from the community etc.This year, the United States became the first-ever country across the globe to declare China's actions in Xinjiang as "genocide".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/video-shot-by-activist-fresh-proof-of-china-s-atrocities-against-uyghurs-101637463192692.html

21-11-2021||World||UK to probe 'systematic bias' in development of medical devices||Britain's health secretary announced Sunday he has launched an independent review to examine if "systematic bias" exists in the development of medical devices, after Covid-19 brought the issue "to the fore".Sajid Javid said he would also work with his counterpart in the United States, Xavier Becerra, and other like-minded nations around the world "so we can shape what sits behind these valuable technologies".Writing in the Sunday Times newspaper, Javid cited research showing that oximeters -- which monitor oxygen levels and have been used during the pandemic -- are less accurate on people with darker skin as highlighting the potential problem."One of the founding principles of our NHS is equality, and the possibility that a bias -- even an inadvertent one -- could lead to a poorer health outcome is totally unacceptable," he wrote, referring to Britain's National Health Service."We urgently need to know more about the bias in these devices, and what impact it is having on the front line."So I have commissioned an independent review, looking at whether systematic bias exists within current devices, and if so, how we can address it."Javid, the son of Pakistani immigrants and the first person from an ethnic minority to hold the role of UK health secretary, said it would assess all medical devices, and other common biases aside from racial bias, such as gender.He noted his interest in focusing on this issue came in part from seeing health disparities during the height of the coronavirus crisis last winter.Then, black, Asian and other minority ethnic groups made up 28 percent of critical-care admissions in England -- about double their representation in the population as a whole.On international collaboration to tackle the issue, Javid said he had already discussed it with Becerra."I want to work with him and other like-minded nations around the world so we can shape what sits behind these valuable technologies," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-probe-systematic-bias-in-development-of-medical-devices-101637460073683.html

His father was a poultry dealer and a music teacher. In the initial years, Dédé started learning the clarinet but soon made a switch over to the violin.Many prominent musicians and composers taught Dédé how to compose his music. This lasted till the end of the Mexican–American War in 1848, when Edmond Dédé left the United States and moved to Mexico to look for work, according to the 9TO5Google report.He came back to the US in 1851 and started working to save money to move to Europe. During the same year, Dédé published “Mon Pauvre Cœur,” which was his earliest surviving work of sheet music.Move to EuropeEdmond Dédé moved to Europe in the late 1850s and studied at the Conservatoire de Paris- a music school in Paris, France.

He also worked at the Théâtre l’Alcazar.Edmond Dédé married frenchwoman Sylvie Leflet in 1864 and the couple moved to Bordeaux. They had a son Eugène who went on to become a music hall conductor.The only visit homeAfter he settled in Bordeaux, Edmond Dédé only visited New Orleans once in 1893. The 9TO5Google’s report said that during the voyage to the US, Dédé’s vessel was shipwrecked.All passengers were rescued but Dédé's favourite violin was lost. However, he was able to obtain a suitable replacement ahead of his solo performance in New Orleans, the report added.Dédé died on January 5, 1903, in Paris.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-doodle-celebrates-194th-birthday-of-black-creole-composer-edmond-dd-101637456084396.html

Nationwide, TSA officers have stopped 4,495 airline passengers from carrying firearms onto their flights, surpassing the 4,432 firearms caught throughout 2019. In Atlanta alone, there were 450 firearms detected at airport checkpoints in 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chaos-at-atlanta-airport-as-convicted-felon-s-gun-goes-off-3-hurt-police-101637456989789.html

21-11-2021||World||Flooding in western Canada: 1 person still missing as death toll reaches 4||The death toll from record flooding in western Canada has risen to four, with a fifth person still missing, local authorities there said Saturday.Torrential rains hit southwestern British Columbia last Sunday and Monday causing widespread flooding and landslides that damaged or destroyed roads and bridges.The body of a woman was found on Monday, near a large section of highway that had been swept away by a mudslide.That highway, which links Vancouver to remote northern parts of the province, was reopened Saturday for "essential travel only," the authorities said.The Royal Canadian Mounted Police confirmed Saturday that the bodies of three men listed earlier as missing have now been found near Duffey Lake, northeast of Vancouver."We have been continuing the search for one more man, however search efforts have been hampered by weather and site conditions," Sergeant Janelle Shoihet of the RCMP said in a statement.The authorities have had to ration fuel as the area struggles with storm-related supply difficulties.Individuals are being limited to purchases of no more than 30 liters (eight gallons) of fuel at the pump -- a measure that might remain in place for 10 days, according to Mike Farnworth, the province's minister of public security.The Trans Mountain pipeline, a crucial link carrying oil from the huge petroleum industry in Alberta Province to the west coast, was temporarily closed by flood damage.Farms have struggled to obtain needed supplies. In Abbotsford, where the army was deployed to deal with severe flooding, four tons of feed were delivered to a pig farm by helicopter on Saturday, the authorities said.More heavy rain is expected in the coming week in the region, which was hammered earlier in the year by a record heat wave and then devastating wildfires.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/flooding-in-western-canada-1-person-still-missing-as-death-toll-reaches-4-101637446250759.html
