Its use against journalists, rights activists and political dissidents from Mexico to Saudi Arabia has been documented since 2015.A successful Pegasus infection surreptitiously gives intruders access to everything a person stores and does on their phone, including real-time communications.It's not clear who placed the NSO spyware on the activists’ phones, said the researcher who first detected it, Mohammed al-Maskati of the nonprofit Frontline Defenders.Shortly after the first two intrusions were identified in mid-October, Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz declared six Palestinian civil society groups to be terrorist organizations. Ireland-based Frontline Defenders and at least two of the victims say they consider Israel the main suspect and believe the designation may have been timed to try to overshadow the hacks’ discovery, though they have provided no evidence to substantiate those assertions.Israel has provided little evidence publicly to support the terrorism designation, which the Palestinian groups say aims to dry up their funding and muzzle opposition to Israeli military rule. Three of the hacked Palestinians work for the civil society groups. The others do not, and wish to remain anonymous, Frontline Defenders says.The forensic findings, independently confirmed by security researchers from Amnesty International and the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab in a joint technical report, come as NSO Group faces growing condemnation over the abuse of its spyware and Israel takes heat for lax oversight of its digital surveillance industry.Last week, the Biden administration blacklisted the NSO Group and a lesser-known Israeli competitor, Candiru, barring them from U.S. technology.Asked about the allegations its software was used against the Palestinian activists, NSO Group said in a statement that it does not identify its customers for contractual and national security reasons, is not privy to whom they hack and sells only to government agencies for use against “serious crime and terror.”An Israeli defense official said in a brief statement that the designation of the six organizations was based on solid evidence and that any claim it is related to the use of NSO software is unfounded. The statement had no other details, and officials declined requests for further comment. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss security matters.Israel’s Defense Ministry approves the export of spyware produced by NSO Group and other private Israeli companies that recruit from the country’s top cyber-capable military units. Critics say the process is opaque.It's not known precisely when or how the phones were violated, the security researchers said. But four of the six hacked iPhones exclusively used SIM cards issued by Israeli telecom companies with Israeli 972 area code numbers, said the Citizen Lab and Amnesty researchers. That led them to question claims by NSO Group that exported versions of Pegasus cannot be used to hack Israeli phone numbers. NSO Group has also said it doesn’t target U.S. numbers.Among those hacked was Ubai Aboudi, a 37-year-old economist and U.S. citizen. He runs the seven-person Bisan Center for Research and Development in Ramallah, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, one of the six groups Gantz slapped with terrorist designations on Oct. 22.The other two hacked Palestinians who agreed to be named are researcher Ghassan Halaika of the Al-Haq rights group and attorney Salah Hammouri of Addameer, also a human rights organization. The other three designated groups are Defense for Children International-Palestine, the Union of Palestinian Women’s Committees and the Union of Agricultural Work Committees.Aboudi said he lost “any sense of safety” through the “dehumanizing” hack of a phone that is at his side day and night and holds photos of his three children. He said his wife, the first three nights after learning of the hack, “didn’t sleep from the idea of having such deep intrusions into our privacy.”He was especially concerned about eavesdroppers being privy to his communications with foreign diplomats. The researchers' examination of Aboudi’s phone determined it was infected by Pegasus in February.Aboudi accused Israel of “sticking the terrorist logo” on the groups after failing to persuade European governments and others to cut off financial support.Israel says the groups are linked to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a leftist political faction with an armed wing that has killed Israelis. Israel and Western governments consider the PFLP a terror group. Aboudi served a 12-month sentence last year after being convicted of charges of involvement in the PFLP but denies ever belonging to the group.Tehilla Shwartz Altshuler, a legal expert at the Israel Democracy Institute, called the findings “really disturbing,” especially if it is proven that Israel's security agencies, who are largely exempt from the country's privacy laws, have been using NSO Group's commercial spyware.“This actually complicates the relationship of the government with NSO," said Altshuler, if the government is indeed both a client and regulator in a relationship conducted under secrecy.The executive director of Frontline Defenders, Andrew Anderson, said the NSO Group cannot be trusted to ensure its spyware is not used illegally by its customers and says Israel should face international reproach if it does not bring the company to heel.“If the Israeli government refuses to take action then this should have consequences in terms of the regulation of trade with Israel,” he said via email.Al-Maskati, the researcher who discovered the hacks, said he was first alerted on Oct. 16 by Halaika, whose phone was determined to have been hacked in July 2020. Al-Haq engages in sensitive communications with the International Criminal Court, among others, involving alleged human rights abuses.“As human rights defenders living under occupation, we expect it was the (Israeli) occupation,” Halaika said when asked who he believed was behind the hack.The phone of the third named hacking victim, Hammouri, was apparently compromised in April, the researchers said. A dual French national living in Jerusalem, Hammouri previously served a seven-year sentence for security offenses, and Israel considers him a PFLP operative, allegations he denies.Hammouri declined to speculate who was behind the hack, saying “we have to determine who had the ability and who had the motive.”After Halaika alerted him, Al-Maskati said he scanned 75 phones of Palestinian activists, finding the six infections. He could not determine how the phones were hacked, he said, though the timeline of evidence encountered indicated the use of a so-called “iMessage zero-click” exploit NSO Group used on iPhones. The exploit is highly effective, requiring no user intervention, as phishing attempts typically do.Facebook has sued NSO Group over the use of a somewhat similar exploit that allegedly intruded via its globally popular encrypted WhatsApp messaging app.A snowballing of new revelations about the hacking of public figures — including Hungarian investigative journalists, the fiancée of slain Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi and an ex-wife of the ruler of Dubai — has occurred since a consortium of international news organizations reported in July on a list of possible NSO Group surveillance targets. The list was obtained from an unnamed source by Amnesty International and the Paris-based journalism nonprofit Forbidden Stories. Among those listed was an Associated Press journalist.From that list of 50,000 phone numbers, reporters from various news organizations were able to confirm at least 47 additional successful hacks, the Washington Post has reported.NSO Group denied ever maintaining such a list.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/6-palestinian-rights-activists-hacked-by-nso-spyware-report-101636367104509.html

Vaccines, testing, and enhancement of handling people recuperating at home and hotels from the discovery of infection to treatment, we are going to strengthen our steps and the holistic plan will be revealed [in] the first half of this month," Yoshihiko told a press conference when asked whether the government will introduce free PCR tests and antigen tests for all willing.The package of measures, which will also include more hospital beds for coronavirus patients, and an opportunity for people with mild symptoms to undergo quarantine in specially designated facilities, including hotels, is aimed to identify positive Covid-19 cases at the early stage.The new plan is expected to help the government prevent a repeat of the scenario of the fifth wave this summer, when the surging numbers of infections led to overloading of medical facilities and shortage of hospital beds.On Sunday, Japan registered no coronavirus-related fatalities over the past 24 hours for the first time in about 15 months as the country's vaccination campaign is progressing. About 73% of the country's population have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-mulls-making-covid-19-testing-free-for-more-people-101636361078665.html

But they must be fully vaccinated to gain entry.All non-American and non-immigrant travellers will be required to show proof of vaccination before airlines will let them to board US-bound flights.Children under 18, participants in clinical trials, people with certain contraindications to the vaccine and those in need to travel in emergency or for humanitarian reason, which will have to be certified by the US government, will be exempted, according to a protocol released by the US government in October. They will still have to test for Covid-19, however, except children under-2.Airlines have been made responsible for enforcing the new travel. “We’re taking an important step forward in operationalising this new system as it relates to international air travel by releasing a series of documents that will help airlines and travellers get ready for November 8 and ensure a smooth transition to the new system,” a senior Biden administration official said to reporters previewing the regulation.As reported by this newspaper earlier under the new protocol, airlines will require travellers to furnish proof of vaccination issued by an official source - for example, a public health agency, government agency - in the country where the vaccine was given.All travellers - US citizens, non-citizens, immigrants and non-immigrants - will also be required to produce a negative test for Covid-19, done in the past 24 hours of travel date.Under the new protocol the airlines will only accept WHO approved vaccines. “Individuals can be considered fully vaccinated ≥2 weeks (more than two weeks) after receipt of the last dose if they have received any single dose of an FDA approved/authorised or WHO EUL (emergency use listing) approved single-dose series (i.e., Janssen), or any combination of two doses of an FDA approved/authorised or WHO emergency use listed Covid-19 two-dose series (i.e. mixing and matching),” the White House had said then.WHO recognises 10 vaccines. One of them is the Serum Institute of India’s Covidshield, which is the widely administered Indian version of AstraZeneca’s vaccine that the US has not approved but pre-ordered millions of does for its stockpile.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-foreign-travellers-welcome-again-in-the-us-from-today-101636345916748.html
08-11-2021||World||World Radiography Day 2021: All you need to know||November 8 is observed annually as World Radiography Day to commemorate the discovery of X-radiation, or X-rays, on November 8, 1895, by German scientist Wilhelm Conrad Rontgen, who, in 1901, became the inaugural winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics for this achievement. The objective behind observing such a day is to raise public awareness of radiographic imaging and therapy, which plays a significant role in the diagnosis and treatment of patients. The occasion also sees radiographers from across the globe promote radiography as a career, as well as a vital contributor to modern healthcare. The first World Radiography Day was celebrated in 2012, with the European Society of Radiology (ESR), Radiological Society of North America (RSNA), and American College of Radiology (ACR) coming together for the initiative. A predecessor for this event was the European Day of Radiology, which was organised by the ESR on February 10, 2011 to coincide with the death anniversary of Wilhem Rontgen, who passed away on February 10, 1923.However, the World Radiography Day celebrations replaced the European Day of Radiology, with November 8, the anniversary of X-ray discovery by Rontgen, being chosen for annual celebrations.Globally, various organisations celebrate this day, including the UK's Society of Radiographers (SoR) and the Association of Radiographers in Nigeria, among others. In India, the Radiographers Association of Madhya Pradesh has been observing this day since 1996, when it was proposed by Shivakant Vajpai, the secretary of the organisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-radiography-day-2021-history-and-significance-of-international-day-of-radiology-101636334483194.html

The traditionally conservative court ordered the government to reply to the motion for a permanent injunction by 5pm on Monday.Singapore reports rare MIS-C virus among kidsSingapore has reported emerging cases of a rare virus-linked paediatric Multi-System Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C) amidst rising number of Covid-19 cases as it tries to arrest the spread of the contagion.The country reported 3,035 new Covid-19 cases on Saturday and 12 deaths due to complications linked to the coronavirus.Four infections are among over 8,000 paediatric Covid-19 cases that are “considered rare” and are emerging since the start of the pandemic, the health ministry said.Britain will start to roll out Merck’s molnupiravir Covid-19 antiviral pill through a drug trial later this month, Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser at the UK health security agency said on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-us-to-finally-reopen-land-air-borders-after-20-months-101636329644191.html
08-11-2021||World||Climate finance key for developing nations||Mohini, who is in her 50s, migrated to Haryana from Shahjahanpur, in search of employment, earlier this year. She couldn’t work as an agricultural labourer back at home, because, she said, the extended rain had made it hard for landowners. When I met her, she was removing water hyacinth from acres of mud flats. The owner mentioned the rains had flooded his fields, turning them into shallow ponds. He lost a season of farming plus spent money to clear the land when it dried. Hundreds of thousands of climate impacted landowners and workers exist. Who will pay for their loss and damage? Who will pay for them to adapt to a new era?India has asked for climate finance to meet its own goals. We lose money every time we are hit by a climate event. By some estimates, Cyclone Amphan cost India 14 billion dollars. But step back into history. India suffered enormous economic losses during colonialism, as both its resources and bullion was taken away to build other empires. The lifestyles and growth these spawned beyond our shores precipitated climate change as we see it today. Today, India is rebuilding itself, after being leached. The finance it needs is not finance but reparations -- a return of its own wealth so it can save its own people. While we shift to renewable energy and adapt to climate change in multiple ways, it is important that India’s history – and that of many other colonized countries -- be part of the battle against climate change.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/climate-finance-key-for-developing-nations-101636326059932.html

But the attack marked a substantial escalation in the country's post-election turmoil.The prime minister's office described the attack as a "failed assassination attempt," while Iraqi President Barham Salih called the strike, which was not immediately claimed by any group, an attempted "coup against the constitutional system."Biden said that "the perpetrators of this terrorist attack on the Iraqi state must be held accountable," as he condemned "in the strongest terms those using violence to undermine Iraq's democratic process."The US leader said he instructed his national security team "to offer all appropriate assistance to Iraq's security forces as they investigate this attack and identify those responsible."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-strongly-condemns-terrorist-attack-at-iraqi-pm-s-residence-101636317254833.html
08-11-2021||World||China: Communist party meet to cement Xi Jinping’s rule||A key three-day Communist Party of China (CPC) meeting to be held in Beijing from Monday is set to cement President Xi Jinping’s authority and pave the way for him to retain power for an unprecedented third time in 2022.The sixth plenary session of the 19th CPC Central Committee will review - and almost certainly pass - a key resolution on the “major achievements and historical experience of the Party’s 100 years of struggles”.The historical document is only the third of its kind since the CPC was founded in 1921 with the first two issued under China’s iconic leaders Mao Zedong in 1945 and the second by Deng Xiaoping in 1981.This year’s plenum will be conducted by the current 19th Central Committee, which was elected in 2017 and will remain until late 2022 when the next party Congress will be held.More than 300 members of CPC’s Central Committee are expected to take part in the closed-door meeting in Beijing.Monday’s meeting has been preceded by China’s Xinhua news agency, publishing an essay, paying glowing tributes to Xi Jinping, describing him as a tireless, selfless and scholarly servant of the people.Xi is “a man of determination and action, a man of profound thoughts and feelings, a man who inherited a legacy and dares to innovate, and a man who has forward-looking vision and is committed to working tirelessly”, Xinhua said.It spoke about how on the “…eve of Lunar New Year 2020, with the Covid-19 epidemic clouding festivities, Xi had a sleepless night”.Headlined, “Xi Jinping, the man who leads CPC (Communist Party of China) on a new journey”, the essay portrayed him as a man with “little time for himself”, for whom “happiness is achieved through hard work”.A political science expert told state media that the meeting will “…re-enhance the Four Consciousnesses and re-affirm the Four Matters of Confidence to ensure the party will move forward in unison”.Quoting Yang Xuedong, a political science professor at Tsinghua University, told Global Times said the “Four Consciousnesses” refers to “consciousnesses of the ideology, the whole, the core and the line”.“When he took power in 2012, Xi spelt out two ‘centenary goals’: to make China a “moderately prosperous” society by 2021, 100 years since the party was founded, and a “great modern socialist country” by 2049, 100 years since Mao declared the establishment of the People’s Republic of China”, the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported.Xi announced that the first goal had been achieved at the party’s centennial this year, and the resolution is likely to chart a path to achieve the second goal, the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-communist-party-meet-to-cement-xi-jinping-s-rule-101636292747986.html
