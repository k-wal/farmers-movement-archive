The TTP have fought for years to overthrow the government in Islamabad and rule the South Asian nation of 220 million with their own brand of Islamic Sharia law.There have been numerous failed attempts to reach peace agreements in the past. The latest talks were opened following the victory of the Afghan Taliban. The two sides have been meeting across the border in Afghanistan, with the aid of Afghan Taliban leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/5-security-personnel-killed-in-separate-attacks-in-pakistan-near-afghanistan-border-101636822547544.html
13-11-2021||World||China, Sri Lanka in rare diplomatic tussle over fertiliser consignment||China and Sri Lanka have been involved in a rare diplomatic tussle over a shipment of organic fertiliser that Colombo refused to accept citing quality issues. In an attempt to turn Sri Lanka into the world's first completely organic farming nation, Colombo struck a deal with Qingdao Seawin Bio-tech group, a Chinese enterprise specialising in seaweed-based fertiliser. But Sri Lanka’s decision to turn down the first consignment of 20,000 tonnes of organic fertiliser has led to diplomatic tension between the two countries.National Plant Quarantine Service, a Sri Lankan government agency, rejected the shipment saying a sample from the cargo had pathogens that can cause crop failure. Dr Ajantha De Silva, director-general, Sri Lankan Department of Agriculture, said that the tests on the cargo samples showed that the fertiliser was not “sterile”, reported BBC."We have identified bacteria which are harmful to plants like carrots and potatoes," BBC quoted De Silva as saying.As the shipment was not allowed to unload in Sri Lanka, a state-run fertiliser company got a court order to stop the state-owned People's Bank from paying $9 million for the cargo. While it’s not clear whether the contract terms allowed the buyer to stop payment, the Chinese embassy in Colombo retaliated by blacklisting the bank for not honouring the payment.In October-end, the official Twitter handle of the Chinese embassy posted a timeline of the events while announcing the blacklisting of the state-run Sri Lankan bank.Timeline:Seawin won open bid, signed contracts, passed tests of China and Int'l agency designated by Ceylon Fertilizer, shipped before due.NPQ SL disagreed in halfway, called toxic/harmful.Ship refused. Third party test refused. L/C payment obligation refused.PBSL blacklisted pic.twitter.com/mMbzqxdwJiThe embassy, however, didn’t provide details on the quality of the fertiliser and the terms of the contract. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said that the cargo had already passed third-party testing, adding that “China has always attached great importance to the quality of exports.”Qingdao Seawin issued a statement accusing Sri Lankan media of using derogatory words to "slander the image of the Chinese enterprises and the Chinese government". It also demanded compensation of $8 million from the NPQ for the loss of reputation it has suffered following the controversy."The unscientific detection method and conclusion of National Plant Quarantine Service (NPQ) in Sri Lanka obviously do not comply with international animal and plant quarantine convention," the company said.While experts are unsure of how long Colombo can resist pressure from Beijing due to its “debt trap” diplomacy, a BBC report citing Sri Lankan officials suggest that “no organic fertiliser that violates current regulations will be allowed into the country" despite China's financial muscle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-sri-lanka-in-rare-diplomatic-tussle-over-fertiliser-consignment-101636815747623.html
13-11-2021||World||Pope Francis thanks journalists for helping uncover Church sexual abuse scandals||Pope Francis on Saturday thanked journalists for helping uncover the clerical sexual abuse scandals that the Roman Catholic Church initially tried to cover up.The pope praised what he called the "mission" of journalism and said it was vital for reporters to get out of their newsrooms and discover what was happening in the outside world to counter misinformation often found online."(I) thank you for what you tell us about what is wrong in the Church, for helping us not to sweep it under the carpet, and for the voice you have given to the abuse victims," the pope said.Francis was speaking at a ceremony to honour two veteran correspondents -- Philip Pullella of Reuters and Valentina Alazraki of Mexico's Noticieros Televisa -- for their long careers spent covering the Vatican.The sexual abuse scandals hit the headlines in 2002, when US daily The Boston Globe wrote a series of articles exposing a pattern of abuse of minors by clerics and a widespread culture of concealment within the Church.Since then, scandals have rocked the Church in myriad countries, most recently France where a major investigation found in October that French clerics had sexually abused more than 200,000 children over the past 70 years.Critics accused Francis of responding too slowly to the scandals after he became Pontiff in 2013 and of believing the word of his fellow clergy over that of the abuse victims.But in 2018 he tried to address past mistakes, publicly admitting he was wrong about a case in Chile and vowing that the Church would never again seek to cover up such wrongdoing. In 2019 he called for an "all-out battle" against a crime that should be "erased from the face of the earth".Francis on Saturday said journalists had a mission "to explain the world, to make it less obscure, to make those who live in it less fear it".To do that, he said reporters needed to "escape the tyranny" of always being online. "Not everything can be told through email, the phone, or a screen," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-francis-thanks-journalists-for-helping-uncover-church-sexual-abuse-scandals-101636814456174.html
13-11-2021||World||‘Future of entire generation at stake’: UN official on increasing child marriage among girls in Afghanistan||A top UN official expressed concerns about increasing child marriages in Afghanistan and said there have been reports about families offering daughters only 20-days old for future marriages in return for a dowry.The executive director of the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Henrietta Fore in a statement said that estimates showed 28% of Afghan women between 15 and 49 years of age were married before turning 18.“I am deeply concerned by reports that child marriage in Afghanistan is on the rise. We have received credible reports of families offering daughters as young as 20 days old up for future marriage in return for a dowry,” Fore said in a statement.“Even before the latest political instability, UNICEF’s partners registered 183 child marriages and 10 cases of selling of children over 2018 and 2019 in Herat and Baghdis provinces alone. The children were between 6 months and 17 years of age,” she added. “UNICEF estimates that 28 per cent of Afghan women aged 15–49 years were married before the age of 18,” she further said.Also read | Nearly 55% of Afghans expected to face food insecurity soon, UN report saysThe UNICEF head also noted that the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, food crisis in the country and the onset of winter have worsened the situation for many families, highlighting that almost 50% of Afghan families lacked basic nutrition or clean water in 2020. “The extremely dire economic situation in Afghanistan is pushing more families deeper into poverty and forcing them to make desperate choices, such as putting children to work and marrying girls off at a young age,” she said.Further, she said that most teenage girls in the country were not allowed to go back to school and thus increasing the risk of child marriage. “Education is often the best protection against negative coping mechanisms such as child marriage and child labour,” she added.Notably, Taliban foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi on Friday claimed that 75% of the girls in the country had resumed their education.UNICEF also called on the “de facto authorities” in Afghanistan to prioritise reopening of schools for secondary school girls and allowing female teachers to resume their work. The UN body also said that it is working to raise awareness about child marriage for girls. “Child marriage can lead to a lifetime of suffering. Girls who marry before they turn 18 are less likely to remain in school and more likely to experience domestic violence, discrimination, abuse and poor mental health. They are also more vulnerable to complications in pregnancy and childbirth,” Fore said.“We have started a cash assistance programme to help offset the risk of hunger, child labour and child marriage among the most vulnerable families. We plan to scale up this and other social services programmes in the months to come,” she added. She also said that UNICEF would work with religious leaders to ensure that they were not involved in the marriage of young girls. However, she said that the measures were not enough. “The future of an entire generation is at stake,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/future-of-entire-generation-at-stake-un-official-on-increasing-child-marriage-among-girls-in-afghanistan-101636813142634.html
13-11-2021||World||3rd draft Glasgow cover decision continues to be weak on finance, loss and adaptation||After night long negotiations on several elements of the Glasgow cover decision, the COP 26 Presidency released another draft text on Saturday morning. Though the third draft text reaffirms the Paris Agreement goal, it has struck a compromise on several fronts and is rather weak on climate finance, adaptation and loss and damage.Climate negotiation experts are disappointed that after a big build up to COP 26 and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) spelling out the urgency of climate crisis, the negotiations failed to capture certain important elements which are critical for implementation of climate change mitigation in developing countries. Following an informal plenary by COP 26 President, Alok Sharma later today, the draft is likely to be considered for adoption. Developing and vulnerable countries are expected to express their views at the plenary. For the first time, the draft cover decision has mentioned the need for phase out of coal and fossil fuel subsidies. But, after several developing countries dissented, the language has been cushioned to say we need to transition towards low emission energy systems, including by rapidly scaling up the deployment of clean power generation and energy efficiency measures “including accelerating efforts towards the phase-out of unabated coal power and inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, recognizing the need for support towards a just transition.”Developing countries like India and the Like-Minded Developing Countries (LMDC—a group of 22 countries) had also sought the mention of historical responsibility in the global average temperature rise of 1.1 degree C till now. The text does not mention that but states: “also noting the importance for some of the concept of ‘climate justice’, when taking action to address climate change.”Climate Finance:One of the main asks for India has been a multilaterally agreed definition of climate finance, delivery of the promised USD 100 billion by developed countries (in 2009) and for a structured process that will deliver the new quantified climate finance goal for climate finance well before 2025. The agreement expresses “deep regret” that the goal of developed country parties to mobilize jointly USD 100 billion per year by 2020 in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation has not yet been met.” The draft agreement urges developed countries to fully deliver on the USD 100 billion goal urgently and through to 2025 and emphasizes the importance of transparency in the implementation of their pledges. It only re-emphasizes the need for scaled-up financial resources to consider the needs of countries particularly vulnerable to climate change and welcomes the initiation of deliberations on a new collective quantified goal on climate finance.“There is nothing much. There is no real commitment on part of developed countries to move ahead with serious and urgent domestic action let alone in terms of global collaboration and truly significant climate finance for tackling climate change,” said Manjeev Singh Puri, former negotiator and ambassador responding to the draft.Loss and Damage:The new draft instead of specifying how finance and compensation will be delivered for Loss and Damage (compensation for impacts of extreme climate change events and slow onset events like sea level rise) talks of setting up “dialogue between parties, relevant organizations, and stakeholders” to discuss the arrangements for the funding of activities to avert, minimise and address loss and damage. Delegates, activists from developing and vulnerable countries were fuming after reading the text. The G77+China had proposed for a Glasgow Facility on loss and damage. The draft only urges developed countries, the operating entities of the Financial Mechanism, United Nations entities and intergovernmental organizations and other bilateral and multilateral institutions, including non-governmental organizations and private sources, to provide enhanced and additional support for activities addressing loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change.“Draft political #COP26 decisions circulated grossly fail any credibility tests:phase out of fossil fuels references are now so weakened down that it is mind-blowing on #LossAndDamage: outcome proposed here is basically more blablabla these drafts CANNOT be accepted,” tweeted Sébastien Duyck, senior attorney working towards climate justice.India had also sought serious decisions at COP26 on compensating loss and damage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/3rd-draft-glasgow-cover-decision-continues-to-be-weak-on-finance-loss-and-adaptation-101636801309058.html
13-11-2021||World||China warns US on Taiwan ahead of Xi-Biden meet||China on Saturday warned the US not to send wrong signals to or support “Taiwan independence” hours after Beijing announced that President Xi Jinping will meet his US counterpart Joe Biden via video link on Tuesday morning.“Chinese President Xi Jinping will meet with US President Joe Biden via video link on the morning of November 16 (Beijing Time),” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said on Saturday.Soon after the announcement of the Xi-Biden meeting, senior Chinese diplomat Wang Yi told US secretary of state, Anthony Blinken that “…any connivance of and support for the ‘Taiwan independence’ forces undermines peace across the Taiwan Strait and would only boomerang in the end”.Wang made the remarks in a phone conversation with Blinken ahead of the two top leaders’ Tuesday summit.According to a readout of the phone conversation released by the Chinese foreign minister, Wang, who is both state councillor and foreign minister, said if the US truly wants to safeguard peace across the Taiwan Strait, then it should clearly and resolutely oppose any “Taiwan independence” moves.The US should abide by the solemn commitments it made in the “..three China-US joint communiques and put the one-China policy into action and stop sending wrong signals to the Taiwan independence forces,” Wang said.Ties between US and Taiwan is one of the major bilateral problems between Beijing and Washington with the former consistently criticising the latter’s ties with Taipei, which the mainland sees as a breakaway region to be unified by force if required.The statement from the Chinese foreign ministry said Wang and Blinken also exchanged views on issues including energy security, climate change and the Iranian nuclear issue, and agreed to maintain dialogue on responding to all kinds of global challenges.On the upcoming meeting, Wang said it will be keenly followed by the whole world as it is of great significance not just for China-US relations, but also for international relations.“The helmsmanship of the two heads of state plays a key role in steering bilateral relations,” he said.Blinken was quoted as saying that both sides have made full preparation and are making progress. “The US side looks forward to sharing views on bilateral ties with the Chinese side during the meeting in the spirit of mutual respect and jointly send a strong message to the world,” Blinken told Wang Yi.Besides fraught ties over a range of issues from trade ties to human rights and transparency over the origins of Covid-19 pandemic, Tuesday’s Xi-Biden meeting will take place in the backdrop of rapid developments in Afghanistan.In September, Xi had told Biden during a phone conversation that the US’ China policy has resulted in serious difficulties in bilateral ties and runs counter to the fundamental interests of the two countries and the common interests of the world.The conversation ended a seven-month gap in direct communication between the leaders of the world’s two largest economies but gave an indication of the existing problems in ties.The only time the two had spoken before September was on February 12, which, incidentally, was also the first time they had spoken after Biden became the US President in January this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-warns-us-on-taiwan-ahead-of-xi-biden-meet-101636796268608.html
13-11-2021||World||Taliban claim 75% of girl students back in Afghanistan schools||The Taliban-ruled government in Afghanistan has said that 75 per cent of girl students have resumed their classes in schools across the country.Speaking at the Centre for Afghanistan, the Middle East and Africa (CAMEA) in Pakistan's Islamabad on Friday, the Taliban's acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi made the remarks while replying to a question about the situation of girls' education in Afghanistan, according to a report by Dawn.After taking control of the war-ravaged country in August this year, the Taliban closed schools for both boys and girls. From September 18, the Taliban allowed boys from classes 6-12 to and male teachers to attend schools.Some schools reopened for girls up to class 6 and women were also allowed to visit universities. But high schools are shut for girls and the Islamic emirate claimed in September that they will be allowed to resume classes for all girls at the earliest.The Taliban has received sharp criticism from the global community for restricting education for girls.Also Read| Afghan girls will be allowed to return to school 'as soon as possible': TalibanOn Friday, foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi also said that it was the global community's duplicity to emphasise women’s education rather than focus on the salary of teachers as salary disbursement becoming difficult due to Afghanistan's assets frozen by the West, the Dawn report said.Muttaqi added as many as 500,000 civil servants in Afghanistan were being paid and no one was fired because of differences in political views. No woman has been sacked, the acting foreign minister also claimed, according to the report.However, several media reports have suggested that women are still not being allowed to go to work and several of them have protested to demand the rights to employment and education.On the other hand, a majority of girl students in Afghanistan who depend on the public education system, also remain at home."Amendments will be made based on our new laws. Islamic scholars will make the decisions," Abdul Hakeim, the chief of staff for the minister of education, said in November."We want an Islamic perspective, and this means separate classes and transport. Once this is sorted out, girls can continue education for a lifetime," Hakeim added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-claim-75-of-girl-students-back-in-afghanistan-schools-101636784083717.html
13-11-2021||World||Canada: Alleged member of proscribed ISYF may be deported to India||A Canadian court has dismissed an application by a person alleged to be the former president of the proscribed International Sikh Youth Federation (ISYF), potentially paving the way for his deportation to India.The ruling was delivered against an application by Ranjit Singh Khalsa by justice Glennys McVeigh of the federal court in Ottawa in late October. Khalsa, who resides in the Metro Vancouver region, had, through his lawyers, contested a decision by a member of the immigration division (ID) of the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB), which found him to be “inadmissible to Canada” under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act “for having been a member” of the ISYF, which became a listed terrorist entity in Canada on June 18, 2003.Stewart Bell, senior journalist with the Canadian outlet Global News, tweeted in this regard, “Federal court upholds deportation order against ISYF member.”In fact, Khalsa is also alleged to have been the president of the ISYF.Khalsa remains an Indian citizen. He came to Canada in 1988 and filed a refugee claim and became a permanent resident in 1992. However, his subsequent application for citizenship finally led to the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) finding him inadmissible because of the alleged ties to the ISYF.The immigration division of the IRB found him inadmissible in a decision dated February 25, 2021, and also issued a deportation order.In her ruling, delivered on October 28, justice McVeigh noted, “In sum, I find the decision - which is long, detailed, and grapples with the major issues - to be reasonable. The ID member dealt reasonably with the evidence before them, and demonstrated a logical chain of analysis that was justified in light of the facts and law before them.”A report from the national broadcaster CBC from August 30, 1999, described Khalsa as “the president of the International Sikh Youth Federation” while quoting him in an article.Hindustan Times reached out to the Vancouver-based law firm Edelmann & Company, which represented Khalsa, for comment on the ruling and whether they were planning to pursue the matter further, but has not received a response so far.Public Safety Canada has ISYF in its listing of terrorist entities. Its description reads: “Since 1984, its members have been engaged in terrorist attacks, assassinations and bombings primarily against Indian political figures, but also against moderate members of the Sikh community.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-proscribed-isyf-member-may-be-deported-to-india-101636787088134.html
13-11-2021||World||US: Former Donald Trump adviser faces jail over Jan 6 insurrection||Steve Bannon, a one-time senior adviser to former President Donald Trump, was on Friday charged with contempt of US congress for defying a subpoena issued to him by a select committee of the House of Representatives that is investigating the January 6 insurrection.Bannon will turn himself in to authorities on Monday. If convicted on the two counts on which he was indicted by a grand jury - one for refusal to appear before the committee and the other for refusing to turn over documents - he faces up to two years in prison and $2,000 in fine.The House committee had summoned him on September 23 but Bannon refused claiming protection of Trump’s presidential executive privilege, which immunises the American president (and former presidents) and his aides from legal challenges for actions taken while in office.The indictment was brought by the US attorney for Washington DC (District of Columbia) after it was cleared by attorney general Merrick Garland in a much anticipated move that presages similar outcomes for many other members of the Trump orbit who have either already claimed executive privilege to defy the committee’s subpoena - such as former chief of staff Mark Meadows - or plan to.“Since my first day in office, I have promised justice department employees that together we would show the American people by word and deed that the department adheres to the rule of law, follows the facts and the law and pursues equal justice under the law,” Garland said, adding, “Today’s charges reflect the department’s steadfast commitment to these principles.”The committee had summoned Steve Bannon saying it had reason to believe he had information pertaining to the January 6 insurrection. “You have been identified as present at the Willard Hotel (which is just a block from the White House and has been a popular hotel for Indian prime ministers and officials on official visit to DC) on January 5, 2021, during an effort to persuade members of congress to block the certification of the election the next day, and in relation to other activities on January 6.... Moreover, you are quoted as stating, on January 5,2021, that ‘(a)ll hell is going to break loose tomorrow’,” the subpoena said.A mob of hundreds of Donald Trump supporters had stormed a joint session of US congress on January 6 to prevent the certification of Joe Biden as president. The insurrection - as the incident has been called officially - was incited by Trump’s false claims of election fraud behind his defeat in the November polls.The committee has issued subpoenas to at least 20 aides of the former president, who include Meadows and former senior adviser Stephen Miller and former White House spokesperson Kayleigh McEnany, who were working with President Trump at the time in the White House.Unlike them, however, Steve Bannon was not working in the White House then. Trump had fired him way back in 2017, but kept him on his speed dial as an adviser. Bannon played a big role in amplifying Trump’s lies about election fraud, as did the former president’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jan-6-insurrection-in-us-former-donald-trump-adviser-faces-jail-101636782287949.html

He has been sentenced to 11 years in jail by a military court in Yangon city for violating visa regulations, association with an illegal group and dissent against the military.Having been in detention since May this year, the American journalist is also facing two additional charges in a different court for violating Myanmar's counterterrorism law and a statute covering treason and sedition.Michelle Bachelet, the United Nations commissioner for human rights, said the sentencing of Fenster was emblematic of a wider plight of journalists in Myanmar who have faced constant repression in the wake of the February coup.Also Read| Myanmar court sentences US journalist to 11 years in jailAccording to the news agency Associated Press, Fenster is the only foreign journalist to be convicted of a serious crime in Myanmar after the fall of Aung San Suu Kyi's government."Journalists have been under attack since 1 February, with the military leadership clearly attempting to suppress their attempts to report on the serious human rights violations being perpetrated across Myanmar as well as the extent of opposition to the regime", Bachelet said, according to an official statement.She said that at least 126 journalists, media officials or publishers had been detained since the coup and 47 of them continue to be in detention.Also Read| Those detained being systematically tortured in Myanmar: ReportThe UN rights chief also pointed out that licenses of as many as nine media outlets had been revoked, while 20 other media houses suspended their operations, the official statement added.Meanwhile, the United States called Danny Fenster's sentencing a conviction of an innocent person and said that it is working towards his immediate release."We are closely monitoring Danny's situation and will continue to work for his immediate release.

13-11-2021||World||Australia, South Korea beyond India & China in per capita coal emissions||India is the world's second-largest consumer of coal-based power, however, its per capita emission is far less than the global average, a fraction of what some of the world's richest countries – such as the United States and Australia – emit, revealed a new analysis by Ember, an independent climate and energy think tank focused on accelerating the global electricity transition. According to research conducted by the organisation, the average person in India emits only half of what the average Canadian would do through coal power and eight times less than the average Australian.The data shows that countries such as Australia, South Korea, South Africa, and the United States are among the worst coal power emitters when the emission figures are adjusted for population size. While Australia has the highest per capita coal emissions in the world (the average Australian emits five times as much carbon dioxide from coal power than the average person globally), South Korea and the United States emit almost four times and three times the global average, respectively.Some pertinent highlights from the Ember analysis:1 . Australia has the highest per capita coal emissions in the entire world; the country emits 5.34 tonnes of carbon dioxide every year. The average Australian emits five times as much carbon dioxide from coal as the average person globally, and almost twice as much as the average person in China.2 . South Korea has the second-highest per-capita coal emissions, among all the G20 countries, at 3.81 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year. The average Korean emits almost four times as much carbon dioxide from coal as the global average.3. The United States has the fourth-highest per capita coal emissions in the G20 at 3.08 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year. The average American emits almost thrice as much carbon dioxide from coal as the global average.4. China was found to be the world's largest coal power consumer and also the fifth in the per capital coal emissions ranking. The country emits 2.71 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year; an average citizen emits 2.5 times as much carbon dioxide from coal as the global average.Notably, according to the International Energy Agency's Net Zero Roadmap, countries within the OECD such as Australia, South Korea, the United States, Germany, and Japan have pledged to end coal power by 2030 to align with a 1.5-degree pathway. However, the recent report sends alarming signals about the global coal emission situation, as these are the very countries found to be among the worst performers on coal power when the data is adjusted for population size.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-south-korea-beyond-india-china-in-per-capita-coal-emissions-101636776615172.html
13-11-2021||World||Former Trump aide Steve Bannon indicted for contempt of Congress||Steve Bannon, a longtime ally of former US president Donald Trump, was indicted Friday on two counts of criminal contempt of Congress after he defied a subpoena from the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection at the US Capitol.The justice department said Bannon, 67, was indicted on one count for refusing to appear for a deposition last month and the other for refusing to provide documents in response to the committee’s subpoena. He is expected to surrender to authorities on Monday and will appear in court that afternoon, a law enforcement official told the AP. The person was granted anonymity to discuss the case.The indictment comes after a parade of Trump administration officials — including Bannon — have defied requests and demands from Congress over the past five years with little consequence, including during Democrats' impeachment inquiry. President Barack Obama's administration also declined to charge two of its officials who defied congressional demands.Attorney General Merrick Garland said Bannon’s indictment reflects the Justice Department’s “steadfast commitment” to the rule of law. Each count carries a minimum of 30 days of jail and as long as a year behind bars.The indictment came as a second expected witness, former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, defied his own subpoena from the committee on Friday and as Trump has escalated his legal battles to withhold documents and testimony about the insurrection.If the House votes to hold Meadows in contempt, that recommendation would also be sent to the Justice Department for a possible indictment.Officials in both Democratic and Republican administrations have been held in contempt by Congress, but criminal indictments for contempt are exceedingly rare. The most recent notable examples of criminal penalties for not testifying before Congress date to the 1970s, including when President Richard Nixon’s aide G. Gordon Liddy was convicted of misdemeanor charges for refusing to answer questions about his role in the Watergate scandal.Democrats who voted to hold Bannon in contempt praised the Justice Department's decision, saying the charges reinforce the authority of Congress to investigate the executive branch and signal potential consequences for those who refuse to cooperate.“The days of defying subpoenas with impunity are over,” tweeted House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, who sits on the Jan. 6 panel and also led Trump's first impeachment inquiry. “We will expose those responsible for Jan 6. No one is above the law.”The chairman of the Jan. 6 panel, Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson, told reporters at an event in his home state of Mississippi on Friday that he will recommend contempt charges against Meadows next week.Thompson and the vice chairwoman of the panel, Republican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, said in a statement: “Mr. Meadows, Mr. Bannon, and others who go down this path won’t prevail in stopping the Select Committee’s effort getting answers for the American people about January 6th, making legislative recommendations to help protect our democracy, and helping ensure nothing like that day ever happens again."Meadows and Bannon are key witnesses for the panel, as they both were in close touch with Trump around the time of the insurrection.Meadows was Trump’s top aide at the end of his presidency and was one of several people who pressured state officials to try and overturn the results. Bannon promoted the Jan. 6 protests on his podcast and predicted there would be unrest. On Jan. 5, he predicted that “all hell is going to break loose.”The indictment says Bannon didn’t communicate with the committee in any way from the time he received the subpoena on Sept. 24 until Oct. 7 when his lawyer sent a letter, seven hours after the documents were due.Bannon, who worked at the White House at the beginning of the Trump administration and currently serves as host of the conspiracy-minded “War Room” podcast, is a private citizen who “refused to appear to give testimony as required by a subpoena,” the indictment says.When Bannon declined to appear for his deposition in October, his attorney said the former Trump adviser had been directed by a lawyer for Trump citing executive privilege not to answer questions. The attorney did not respond to a message seeking comment on Friday.This is not the first time the longtime Trump ally has faced legal peril. In August of last year, Bannon was pulled from a luxury yacht and arrested on allegations that he and three associates ripped off donors trying to fund a southern border wall. Trump later pardoned Bannon in the final hours of his presidency.Meadows, a former congressman from North Carolina, defied his subpoena on Friday after weeks of discussions with the committee. His lawyer said that Meadows has a “sharp legal dispute” with the panel as Trump has claimed executive privilege over the former chief of staff's testimony, as he had with Bannon's.The White House said in a letter Thursday that President Joe Biden would waive any privilege that would prevent Meadows from cooperating with the committee, prompting Meadows' lawyer to say he wouldn't comply.“Legal disputes are appropriately resolved by courts,” said the lawyer, George Terwilliger. “It would be irresponsible for Mr. Meadows to prematurely resolve that dispute by voluntarily waiving privileges that are at the heart of those legal issues.”As the sitting president, Biden has so far waived most of Trump's assertions of privilege over documents and interviews, citing the interest of the public in knowing what happened on Jan. 6. Trump sued the committee and the National Archives to stop the release of documents, and U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan has repeatedly backed Biden's position, noting in one ruling this week that “Presidents are not kings, and Plaintiff is not President.”The panel's proceedings and attempts to gather information have been delayed as Trump has appealed Chutkan's rulings. On Thursday, a federal appeals court temporarily blocked the release of some of the White House records the panel is seeking, giving that court time to consider Trump's arguments.Still, the House panel is continuing its work, and members have already interviewed more than 150 witnesses in an attempt to build a comprehensive record of how a violent mob of Trump's supporters broke into the Capitol and temporarily halted the certification of Biden's victory.The committee has subpoenaed almost three dozen people, including former White House staffers, Trump allies who strategized about how to overturn his defeat and people who organized a giant rally near the White House on the morning of Jan. 6. While some, like Meadows and Bannon, have balked, others have spoken to the panel and provided documents.___Emily Wagster Pettus reported from Mississippi.

Its ruling comes ahead of a Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation lottery to determine which federal appeals court will be assigned to adjudicate the many legal challenges to the measure now pending across the country. The lottery is slated for November 16.In a 22-page opinion, the court had harsh words for the vaccine mandate. The mandate “threatens to substantially burden the liberty interests of reluctant individual recipients put to a choice between their job(s) and their jab(s),” the court said.“Likewise, the companies seeking a stay, in this case, will also be irreparably harmed in the absence of a stay, whether by the business and financial effects or a lost or suspended employee, compliance and monitoring costs associated with the Mandate, the diversion of resources necessitated by the Mandate, or by OSHA’s plan to impose stiff financial penalties on companies that refuse to punish or test unwilling employees,” the court said.The US had asked the court to set aside its prior order to allow that process to play out.OSHA’s rule requires qualifying businesses to ensure that all employees are fully vaccinated by January 4 or subjected to testing for Covid-19 at least weekly.Barring a long-lasting injunction, employers will have to comply with other parts of the rule by December 5, including developing a compliance plan, offering paid time off for vaccinations, and requiring unvaccinated workers to wear masks.The Fifth Circuit is considering challenges filed by Texas, joined by Louisiana, Mississippi, Utah, South Carolina, and companies that claim they’re adversely affected by the rule. The plaintiffs contend the emergency temporary standard, formally published Nov. 5, exceeds OSHA’s statutory authority and that the requisite “grave danger” the safety agency cited as justification for the expedited rulemaking doesn’t actually exist outside of the healthcare industry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-court-extends-order-pausing-biden-s-shot-or-test-mandate-for-businesses-101636770807878.html

Here's what experts say||Cases of “mysterious viral fever” are being witnessed in Pakistan's Karachi that behave exactly like dengue fever as it reduces platelets and white blood cells of the patients, local media reported citing field experts.The News International citing clinicians and pathologists on Thursday reported that when the viral fever was tested for dengue, the result comes out to be negative."For a couple of weeks, we are seeing cases of viral fever, in which platelets and white blood cells are dropping while other clinical symptoms are also similar to the dengue fever. But when NS1 antigen of these patients is performed, their tests come out to be negative," Professor Saeed Khan, the head of molecular pathology at the Dow University of Health Sciences, said, according to the publication.Other experts, including physicians and hemato-pathologists from different hospitals of the city, have also confirmed that a dengue virus-like pathogen is circulating in Karachi, causing a disease that is acting similar to dengue fever and requires the same treatment protocols but it is not dengue fever.A molecular scientist, Dr Muhammad Zohaib, who is associated with the Children's Hospital in Gulshan-e-Iqbal, also confirmed that cases of viral fever, which was not dengue but had dengue-like symptoms, had been witnessed by them as well as several other pathologists in the city."Owing to this mysterious viral disease in addition to growing number of dengue fever cases, there is an extreme shortage of mega units of platelets as well as random units in the city. People are moving from pillar to post for mega units and random platelets units for their loved ones," he said.As many as 45 new dengue fever cases have been reported in Pakistan's capital city Islamabad on Friday, ARY News reported citing the district health officer (DHO) said.According to Pakistani media, a total of 4,292 mosquito-borne viral disease cases have been reported in the federal capital in the current season.According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection that is common in warm, tropical climates and often peaks during rainy seasons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mysterious-viral-fever-reported-in-pakistan-s-karachi-here-s-what-experts-say-101636769723127.html

These animals had mild symptoms, although some had a cough and nasal discharge.Apart from them, none of the other 12,000 animals in the St. Louis Zoo have tested positive, the local newspaper reported. The staff has not traced the source of the infection among the cats.The zoo has been vaccinating its animals with an animal-specific vaccine for more than a month against the disease that has wreaked havoc on the global human population, The Hill reported.In September, six big cats tested positive for the coronavirus at the Smithsonian National Zoo.According to the CDC, the risk of animals spreading the coronavirus to humans is low, but people have been documented spreading the virus to animals across the world, according to The Hill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eight-big-cats-test-covid-19-positive-in-us-zoo-report-101636766079842.html
13-11-2021||World||Chinese embassy pushes US businesses to oppose anti-China bills: Report||China has been pushing US executives, companies and business groups in recent weeks to fight against China-related bills in the US Congress, four sources familiar with the initiative told Reuters, in letters to and meetings with a wide range of actors in the business community.Letters from China's embassy in Washington have pressed executives to urge members of Congress to alter or drop specific bills that seek to enhance US competitiveness, according to the sources and the text of a letter sent by the embassy's economic and commercial office seen by Reuters.Chinese officials warned companies they would risk losing market share or revenue in China if the legislation becomes law, according to the text of the letter.The Chinese embassy and the head of its economic and commercial office did not return separate requests for comment.The sources said China's request also left some individuals who received a letter concerned that they could be seen as violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) if they lobbied lawmakers on similar issues in the future.As a result, none of the sources wanted to be identified as having received or seen the letter.Sweeping legislation to boost US competition with China and fund much-needed semiconductor production, known as the US Innovation and Competition Act (USICA), passed the Senate with bipartisan support in June. A related bill in the House of Representatives called the Eagle Act, which is more strictly policy focused, has stalled as Congress has been preoccupied with other domestic initiatives.The language in the letters, which Reuters determined were sent separately to a wide number of people, explicitly asks companies to oppose USICA and the Eagle Act.Beijing sees the measures, which take a hard line toward China on human rights and trade issues, as part of a US effort to counter the country's growing economic and geopolitical might."We sincerely hope you... will play a positive role in urging members of Congress to abandon the zero-sum mindset and ideological prejudice, stop touting negative China-related bills, delete negative provisions, so as to create favorable conditions for bilateral economic and trade cooperation before it is too late," the Chinese embassy said in one letter sent in early November.Reuters confirmed the shared language of the letter with the four sources."The result of those China-related bills with negative impacts will not be that the interests of US companies will be protected while those of Chinese companies will suffer. It is only going to hurt everyone," it said."Promoting a China-free supply chain will inevitably result in a decline in China's demand for US products and American companies loss of market share and revenue in China," it said.Two of the sources said similar messages were conveyed in meetings with staff of China's embassy."It's an outright ask by a foreign government," one of the sources said, highlighting the implications for FARA, which requires persons acting on behalf of a foreign power or political party to disclose those relations to the Department of Justice.A second source said the approach appeared geared at getting companies to delay the legislative process rather than block the bills entirely.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-embassy-pushes-us-businesses-to-oppose-anti-china-bills-report-101636756442726.html

Fischer, 54, of Hopatcong, were aboard the single-engine Cessna 172 that went down Thursday.De Vries was an instrument-rated private pilot, and Fischer owned a flight school. Authorities have not said who was piloting the small plane.The plane had left Essex County Airport in Caldwell, on the edge of the New York City area, and was headed to Sussex Airport, in rural northwestern New Jersey, when the Federal Aviation Administration alerted public safety agencies to look for the missing plane around 3 p.m.Emergency crews found the wreckage in Hampton Township around 4 p.m., the FAA said.De Vries, co-founder of a tech company, took a 10-minute flight to the edge of space Oct. 13 aboard Blue Origin’s New Shepard spacecraft with Shatner and two others.“It’s going to take me a while to be able to describe it. It was incredible,” de Vries said as he got his Blue Origin “astronaut wings” pinned onto his blue flight suit by Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos."We are devastated to hear of the sudden passing of Glen de Vries," Blue Origin tweeted Friday. “He brought so much life and energy to the entire Blue Origin team and to his fellow crewmates. His passion for aviation, his charitable work, and his dedication to his craft will long be revered and admired.”De Vries co-founded Medidata Solutions, a software company specializing in clinical research, and was the vice chair of life sciences and health care at Dassault Systemes, which acquired Medidata in 2019. He had taken part in an auction for a seat on the first flight and bought a seat on the second trip.De Vries also served on the board of Carnegie Mellon University.Fischer owned the flight school Fischer Aviation and was its chief instructor, according to the company's website.The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vries-who-went-to-space-with-shatner-aboard-blue-origin-dies-in-plane-crash-101636756162328.html

13-11-2021||World||As time runs out, COP26 tries to reach compromise between equity and ambition||A new cover decision draft text was released by the Glasgow climate change conference (COP 26) Presidency on Friday morning after there was no consensus on the previous one released on Wednesday. The new draft text changed the language on some fronts to strike a compromise with dissenting parties. One of those is weakening the language on the phaseout of coal and fossil fuel subsidies. Both coal and fossil fuel phaseout are being explicitly mentioned for the first time in decision texts.Text on coal and fossil fuels weakenedThe previous draft on Wednesday called upon parties to “accelerate the phasing-out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels” which has now been reworded to “adoption of policies for the transition towards low-emission energy systems, including by rapidly scaling up clean power generation and accelerating the phaseout of unabated coal power and of inefficient subsidies for fossil fuels.” Saudi Arabia and a few other developing countries had objected to the clause on fossil fuels while some countries like China and India had also raised concerns with phasing out of coal.The new draft reaffirms the Paris Agreement temperature goal of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels. Instead of “urging” parties to revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets in their nationally determined contributions (NDCs), as necessary to align with the Paris Agreement temperature goal by the end of 2022, the new draft “requests” parties to revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets. Some experts said, “requests” can be considered stronger language than “urges” in United Nations parlance. The Like Minded Developing Countries (LMDC), including India and China, had objected to this timeline for revisiting the targets.There are no major changes to the rest of the text. In summary: the draft continues to recognise the 1.5 degrees global warming goal; it also recognizes that limiting global warming to 1.5 °C requires rapid, deep and sustained reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions, including reducing global carbon dioxide emissions by 45% by 2030 relative to the 2010 level and to net-zero around mid-century, as well as deep reductions in non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gases.No improvement on climate financeThe language on finance is slightly stronger but still weak overall without clear timelines. It “notes with deep regret that the goal of developed country parties to mobilize jointly USD 100 billion per year by 2020 in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation has not yet been met.”The draft urges developed country parties to fully deliver on the USD 100 billion goal urgently and through to 2025 and emphasizes the importance of transparency in the implementation of their pledges; urges the operating entities of the Financial Mechanism, multilateral development banks and other financial institutions to further scale up investments in climate action and calls for a continued increase in the scale and effectiveness of climate finance from all sources globally, including grants and other highly concessional forms of finance.Progress in adaptation and loss and damageBut there are two redeeming features—on adaptation, the draft urges developed countries to at least double their collective provision of climate finance for adaptation to developing countries from the current level by 2025 as a step towards achieving a balance between mitigation and adaptation. But it still doesn’t say 50-50% break-up of finance for adaptation and mitigation which developing countries had been asking for. Loss and damage (mechanism to compensate vulnerable countries for loss due to extreme climate events and slow onset events) has its own section. It recognises the importance of compensating loss and damage the Santiago network on Loss and Damage will be supported by a technical assistance facility to provide financial support for technical assistance for the implementation of relevant approaches to avert, minimize, and address loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change. It also “urges” developed country parties to provide funds for the technical facility and for the operation of the Santiago network but experts said the text still falls short of starting a finance stream on loss and damage.Carbon market in the makingDraft texts on various aspects of carbon markets or Article 6 were also out on Friday morning. Though most of it remained bracketed, there was some progress, experts said. For India, the issue of carbon markets has been of priority. The environmental integrity of the market mechanism is of the highest concern, experts said. “The issue of the corresponding adjustment (applying adjustments will help avoid double counting of emissions reductions) is at the heart of the Article 6 discussions along with carryover and methodologies. The newly presented distinct options of Paris Agreement Adjusted Units and Paris Agreement Support Units can potentially help address the double claiming issue that is widely debated,” said Chirag Gajjar, Head Subnational Climate Action, World Resources Institute, India. Double counting refers to a situation where two parties (buyer and seller) claim emission reduction.“The text fails to deliver on strong climate action. Only 'inefficient' fossil fuel subsidies need to go out, other subsidies can continue. Coal power need not be phased out, only 'unabated' coal power needs to be phased out. Basically, the updated text is about 'we want everyone to be happy' rather than 'we want everyone to be ambitious.’ On finance, the only thing developing countries have got is a more aggressive 'tone' in the text, rather than anything meaningful. So, it is 'deeply regretted' that the USD 100 billion target is not achieved, and developed parties are 'urged' to meet this by 2025. There has been no upping of financial commitments, something that India's PM Modi emphasized on the first day,” said Vaibhav Chaturvedi, fellow, Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW). “The financial facility for loss and damage is very useful. But if progress on it is at the same pace as that of the larger finance debate, the delivery will leave much to be desired,” Chaturvedi added."The latest draft has diluted language on coal and fossil fuels, to only address unabated coal power and inefficient subsidies for fossil fuels. It does mention a new "technical assistance facility" for loss and damage in addition to the Santiago Network. However, overall language on climate finance and loss and damage are still extremely vague and weak, with no mention of specific additional finance,” said Avantika Goswami, climate-policy specialist at Centre for Science and Environment.“Rich countries like the USA, European Union and Australia push back on starting a new stream of finance under the UN Climate Change that is urgently needed to help vulnerable communities facing losses and damages. The biggest historical emitters continue to look the other way as millions suffer from crop failures, devastating floods, ravaging wildfires and are being displaced and forced to migrate to survive,” said Harjeet Singh, senior advisor, Climate Action Network International adding that “they do recognise the need to increase finance to address loss and damage but fall short of starting a new stream.”People against ‘carbon colonialism’A fully packed People’s Plenary took place at COP 26 on Friday a few hours after the draft text was released. Various constituencies representing indigenous people, gender rights etc compared climate change to colonialism. Ta’kaiya Blaney, indigenous youth activist and a member of Tla’amin First Nation from Salish Sea in British Columbia said, “My lands, waters are under the genocidal legal occupation of the Canadian government… climate change bleeds us of our birthright. Climate change is a symbol of colonialism. Nature-based solutions and carbon markets are false solutions and only lead to the commodification of nature. Tasneem Essop, executive director of Climate Action Network International compared climate crisis to apartheid. “Let’s say no to vaccine apartheid; no to climate apartheid those leaders inside are busy signing off and deleting human rights, gender rights from the text…they are not willing to provide financial support which is their obligation. Climate justice now!”Women and gender constituency activists called for environmental integrity, health justice, climate justice, racial justice. “Leaders keep failing us and they will keep failing us because they just don’t have what it needs to get it done. Let’s fight back harder and unite stronger and smash the patriarchy,” one of the activists said during the plenary. Activists and delegates also walked out of COP26 in solidarity with the cause of climate justice.Negotiations may extend to Saturday“This is our collective moment in history. It is our chance to forge a clean, prosperous world. We must rise to the occasion,” said Alok Sharma, COP 26 President during a stocktaking plenary on Friday afternoon. He said many texts are not totally clean, brackets continue despite extensive discussions with ministers and delegates on Thursday night. He hoped that these issues are resolved by late Friday evening. During stocktaking, developed countries like Canada, Norway, the EU, among others, said they prefer stronger language on mitigation particularly on the 1.5 degrees C goal.European Commission in-charge of the European Green Deal, Frans Timmermans, said, there is better compromise on Article 6 in Glasgow than in Madrid (COP25) indicating that the markets rulebook may be closed in Glasgow. Saudi Arabia negotiator said during the plenary that the draft text is attempting to rewrite the Paris Agreement by focusing only on certain aspects of it. “1.5 degrees C goal is a no brainer. Nobody in this room has disagreed. But how and on what grounds? Where are the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities? Without technology, finance this ambition is not equitable.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cop26-draft-text-makes-certain-compromises-continues-to-recognise-1-5-degree-goal-101636713945170.html
13-11-2021||World||Canada set to welcome record number of permanent residents from India this year||More than five months of a ban on direct flights from India does not appear to have dampened the enthusiasm of Indians seeking to settle in Canada, with new data showing that Indian immigration expected to set a new record this year. The Covid-19 pandemic led to a steep decline in Indians attaining permanent resident (PR) status in Canada last year, but there has been a surge in those numbers in 2021 with 69,014 Indian nationals becoming permanent residents by the end of August this year.By comparison, the figure for all of 2020 was 37,125. And the trend for 2021 indicates that the intake numbers for the year will be higher than the previous all-time high of 84,114, which was set in 2019.One of the reason is that the government has been pushing for proving a pathway to permanent residence for those already in Canada since May this year, when Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) announced three streams to enable that process. Under that process, IRCC said it would accept 20,000 applications for temporary workers in the healthcare sector, 30,000 applications for temporary workers in other selected essential occupations, and 40,000 applications for international students who graduated from a Canadian institution.The 2021 numbers support trend of burgeoning immigration of Indians to Canada in recent years. Indian immigrants accounted for one-fourth of the total permanent residencies granted in 2019, setting a new record at the time. India has been the biggest source country for permanent residents since 2017, when it overtook China, but the numbers have jumped in recent years, with an increase of over 20% between 2018 and 2019.Toronto-based lawyer Ravi Jain, founder of the Canadian Immigration Lawyers’ Association, said part of the reason for the ongoing surge was the impact of the restrictions in the United States under the administration of former president Donald Trump, as well as other magnet countries like Australia closing their borders during the pandemic for a protracted period.“Canada is just seen as a very welcoming country for a lot of families,” he said.In 2020, Canada also set more ambitious immigration targets. The 2021‒2023 Immigration Levels Plan announced then was intended to compensate for the projected shortfall in 2020 due to the travel and other restrictions as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.While the previous plan set targets of 351,000 PRs for 2021 and 361,000 for 2022, these were increased to 401,000 and 411,000. The figure for 2023 is even higher at 421,000. The majority of the admissions, 60%, will be in the economic class, which has been dominated by Indians in recent years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-set-to-welcome-record-number-of-permanent-residents-from-india-101636708363196.html
13-11-2021||World||Chinese President Xi Jinping warns against 'Cold War' in Asia-Pacific||Chinese President Xi Jinping warned Thursday against letting tensions in the Asia-Pacific region cause a relapse into a Cold War mentality.His remarks on the sidelines of the annual summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum came weeks after the U.S., Britain and Australia announced a new security alliance in the region which would see Australia build nuclear submarines. China has harshly criticized the deal.And in a separate illustration of strains within APEC, one Southeast Asian delegate told The Associated Press that the group had so far failed to reach agreement on a U.S. bid to host the 2023 summit due to unmet demands from Russia.Xi spoke in a pre-recorded video to a CEO Summit at APEC, which is being hosted by New Zealand in a virtual format. Xi is scheduled to participate in an online meeting with other Pacific Rim leaders including U.S. President Joe Biden on Saturday.In his speech, Xi said attempts to draw boundaries in the region along ideological or geopolitical lines would fail. His reference to the Cold War echoes Beijing's oft-stated position that the U.S. should abandon that way of thinking in dealing with China.“The Asia-Pacific region cannot and should not relapse into the confrontation and division of the Cold War era,” Xi said.Xi also said the region should make sure to keep supply lines functioning and to continue liberalizing trade and investment.“China will remain firm in advancing reform and opening up so as to add impetus to economic development,” he said.The most pressing task in the region is to make an all-out effort to fight the pandemic and to emerge from its shadow as soon as possible, he said.Meanwhile, the Southeast Asian delegate, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to publicly discuss the issue, said Russia had refused to support the U.S. bid unless some of its diplomats were removed from a U.S. blacklist or allowed to enter the U.S. to participate in the APEC meetings.The delegate said the U.S. is unlikely to agree to Russia’s demands because issues involving America’s security are considered “non-negotiable.” The delegate added that China had stayed silent on the U.S. offer.If the 21 APEC leaders fail to reach a consensus on the U.S. bid by Friday, the delegate said, a paragraph in a draft of the summit communique welcoming the U.S. offer would have to be deleted.New Zealand’s Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahuta said earlier this week that APEC was founded on consensus and that there was not yet a confirmed host for 2023.Human rights lawyer Amal Clooney also spoke at the CEO summit, saying she believed that liberal democracies could improve global human rights by pressuring autocratic nations. She said businesses also needed to play a role.“If you can't battle evil, you can at least try to tackle apathy,” Clooney said. “And if you can't rely on liberal governments to solve global issues, you have to try and inspire the private sector to step in."In all, APEC members account for nearly 3 billion people and about 60% of the world’s GDP. But deep tensions run through the unlikely group of 21 nations and territories that include the U.S., China, Taiwan, Russia, and Australia.Many of the countries in Asia endeavor to balance Chinese and U.S. influences on the economic and geopolitical fronts.China claims vast parts of the South China Sea and other areas and has moved to establish a military presence, building islands in some disputed areas as it asserts its historic claims.Both Taiwan and China have applied to join a Pacific Rim trade pact, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, with Beijing saying it will block Taiwan’s bid on the basis that the democratically governed island refuses to accept that it’s part of communist-ruled China.Officials say they have made significant progress during some 340 preliminary meetings leading up to this week's leaders' meeting.

During an interview with the TF1 television, the French minister confirmed that his country is now at the beginning of the fifth wave of the pandemic, much like “several [other] neighbouring countries”, adding that the circulation of the virus was accelerating.“Several neighbouring countries are already in a fifth wave of the Covid epidemic, what we are experiencing in France clearly looks like the beginning of a fifth wave,” Veran was quoted as saying by the Reuters news agency in the TF1 interview.France's health ministry registered as many as 11,883 new Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, the second day in a row that the new case tally has remained over 10,000. New coronavirus cases have also seen double-digit percentage increases week-on-week since around mid-October.Warning that Covid-19 infection rates are climbing again in the country, French president Emmanuel Macron said earlier this week that those aged 65 and above in the country will need to show proof of a Covid-19 booster jab to be able to visit restaurants, attend cultural events, and take intercity trains. “From December 15, you [over 65s] will need to provide proof of a booster jab to extend the validity of your health pass,” Macron was quoted as saying by the AFP news agency during an address to the nation.Macron also urged the six million people eligible for the vaccine in France who have not yet even received the first dose to come forward and get the jab. “This is an appeal to responsibility – get vaccinated,” he said. Warning that the pandemic isn't over yet, the French president said that all barrier gestures that protect people from both Covid-19 and other contagious winter diseases should be given more attention at this time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-has-entered-the-5th-wave-of-covid-19-warns-minister-101636599102429.html
