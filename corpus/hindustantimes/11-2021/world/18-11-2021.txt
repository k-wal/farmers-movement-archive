In past years when a U.S. president hasn’t attended, the delegation has included senior officials who work on economic issues and trade.White House spokespeople did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Biden’s decision to skip the meetings marks a departure from former President Donald Trump’s approach. Trump went twice while in office, in 2018 and 2020, breaking a long-running string of absences by U.S. presidents. He’d planned to go in 2019 but canceled that trip due to a partial U.S. government shutdown.Barack Obama, George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush never attended during their presidencies. Bill Clinton went once as president, in 2000, to mark the 30th anniversary of the gathering, though he’s attended regularly since leaving office. The in-person event is scheduled for Jan. 17-21 and is intended “to address economic, environmental, political and social fault lines exacerbated by the pandemic,” the organizers have said. A Davos meeting was held virtually earlier this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-plans-to-skip-january-s-world-economic-forum-in-davos-report-101637259822272.html
18-11-2021||World||France bans wild circus animals and mink farms||The French parliament voted Thursday to end wild animals being used in live circus shows and outlawed mink farming, in new animal-rights legislation hailed as a step forward by campaigners.Performances of wild animals such as lions, tigers or bears will be prohibited in two years, and owning them outlawed in seven years, under the wide-ranging law that has been under debate since 2020.The new regulations, once signed into law by President Emmanuel Macron, will also ban live dolphin shows and mink farming, meaning the country's last mink producer will close.Macron's centrist Republic on the Move (LREM) party called the legislation "a historic step in the animal rights combat," while former actress and animal rights activist Brigitte Bardot welcomed "a major advance".Circus owners denounced it, however, while some campaigners said it did not go far enough.As well as the measures targeting circuses, the new law will raise the maximum penality for mistreating animals to up to five years in prison and a fine of 75,000 euros ($85,000), and will tighten restrictions on the sale of pets.Loic Dombreval, the LREM co-sponsor of the law, conceded that other controversial issues had not been included within the scope of the legislation, which won cross-party support in both houses of parliament."There will inevitably come a day when... we will debate sensitive issues such as hunting, such as bull-fighting, or some animal-rearing practices," said the lawmaker, who is also a veterinarian.Broad supportPolls show that a vast majority of French people support the ban on wild circus animals, and dozens of cities and towns around the country already bar them.Public opinion in Europe has moved decisively against animal circuses, once a popular form of family entertainment, following revelations about cruel treatment and campaigning from rights groups.Several events in France in recent years have added momentum for the ban, including the death of a sickly performing bear called Mischa in 2019 that had been rescued from animal trainers, as well as the shooting of an escaped tiger in Paris in 2017.The tigress, named Mevy, escaped from her enclosure at the Cirque Bormann-Moreno and began roaming the streets of the French capital before being gunned down by her owner in the name of public safety.France lags behind around 20 European countries that have either banned or heavily restricted the use of animals for entertainment already.Arbitrary lawEnvironmentalists and more radical animal rights groups had wanted the new law to improve the conditions inside industrial animal farms.The group L214, which had sought protections for the "more than a billion intensely farmed animals" in France, welcomed the legislation but said it "lacked courage".The group has made a name for itself in France by sending its activists undercover into abattoirs and then publishing videos of the often shocking scenes of animals being mistreated or cut up while still alive.Farms that make foie gras pate in France -- which force-feed birds such as geese and ducks to artificially bloat their livers -- have also long been targeted by campaigners, but their operations will not be changed by the new law.Hunting is staunchly defended by supporters as a traditional rural pastime that is essential to keep animal populations under control, while bull-fighting remains part of local culture in some southern French towns.The 120 circus owners in France are likely to protest against the new restrictions and have warned that some animals might end up abandoned."It's an arbitrary law because there are not mistreated animals in our circuses," William Kerwich, head of the circus animal trainers' union, told AFP.He said there would be a reaction from his members on Monday, and a legal appeal.The new legislation also bans the use of wild animals in television shows, nightclubs and private parties.The French fur industry has fought a dogged rearguard action in recent years against the ban on mink farms and luxury fashion houses going fur-free.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-bans-wild-circus-animals-and-mink-farms-101637257337645.html
18-11-2021||World||US’ ‘country of particular concern’ list: Pak terms inclusion ‘arbitrary’||Pakistan rejected the US’ designation of the nation as ‘country of particular concern’ on Thursday and termed the assessment ‘arbitrary’. Pakistan foreign ministry spokesperson Asim Iftikhar Ahmed said that the assessment was completely against the ‘realities on the ground’.The United States on Wednesday designated Pakistan, China, Iran, North Korea and Myanmar as nations of particular concern for violating religious freedom. “I am designating Burma (Myanmar), the People’s Republic of China, Eritrea, Iran, the DPRK, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan as Countries of Particular Concern for having engaged in or tolerated systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of religious freedom,” US secretary of state Antony Blinken said on Wednesday.It also designated the Taliban as ‘Entity of Particular Concern’ along with al-Shabab, Boko Haram, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the Houthis, ISIS, ISIS-Greater Sahara, ISIS-West Africa, Jamaat Nasr al-Islam wal-Muslimin.Pakistan said that Blinken’s statement raised issues on the credibility of the assessment. “Such subjective designations do not contribute towards promoting the cause of religious freedom worldwide,” Asim Iftikhar Ahmed said.Ahmed stressed that the Pakistani society was ‘multi-religious and pluralistic with a rich tradition of inter-faith harmony’. “Religious freedom and the protection of the rights of minorities are guaranteed by the constitution and ensured through a range of legislative, policy and administrative measures,” he was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.“We believe the redressal of the rising trend of intolerance, discrimination, xenophobia and Islamophobia requires global efforts based on the principles of cooperation and mutual understanding,” he further added.Pakistan faced criticism from several quarters over its treatment of minorities as well its actions on stopping the financing of terror operations from its soil. The nation also remained on the watchdog Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) grey list for not being able to address issues related to terror financing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-country-of-particular-concern-list-pak-terms-inclusion-arbitrary-101637253111046.html

IBM is developing automated order taking for McDonald's Corp drive-throughs.US restaurant staffing levels broadly are still at least 10% lower than before the pandemic, helping boost margins, said Rabobank analyst Tom Bailey."You'd see some of the digital automation tools deployed to cover that 10% gap as they grow," he said.The pandemic pushed people to place more orders online for carry out, delivery and drive-through. To keep up, Starbucks shifted its development strategy to new store formats, adding pickup-only locations in urban areas, as well as traditional cafes and suburban drive-throughs.Starbucks and Amazon plan to open at least two more US locations together in 2022, said Kathryn Young, Starbucks' senior vice president of global growth and development.Starbucks baristas will make drinks and the rest of the chain's menu at the new location in New York City, which will have the same staffing level as any other Starbucks, she said.Customers can order through the Starbucks app and grab coffee to go from a counter near the door. Or they can use a credit card, Amazon app or Amazon One palm reader to enter the rest of the space, take snacks from shelves, or sit at tables.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/starbucks-links-with-amazon-go-for-first-cashier-less-cafe-101637245432124.html
18-11-2021||World||China: President Xi Jinping’s works now available in Hindi||The first volume of President Xi Jinping’s “Governance in China”, which the state media claims has sold millions of copies globally, is now available in Hindi for the first time.It is rare to find the written works of Chinese leaders in Hindi except Mao Zedong’s, some of whose works including the “Little Red Book” had been translated into the language and widely read by far-left supporters in India.An event organised by the Communist Party of China (CPC), marking the publishing of Xi’s works in the languages of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) member states and dialogue partners, was held at the multilateral group’s secretariat in Beijing on Wednesday.Among the books that were unveiled were the first volume of “Xi Jinping: The Governance of China” in Hindi, Pashto, Dari, Sinhalese and Uzbek.The book is described by the Chinese government as a “collection of his major work and wisdom on experiences, policies and perspective of the entire Communist Party’s leadership, as well as vision for the future of the world’s most populous country, over the first two years in office.”The book has two more volumes. India is among the member countries of the SCO, having joined the group in 2017.The high-profile event was jointly supported by the CPC central committee’s publicity department and the state-run China International Publishing Group.Xi’s book comes in three separate volumes and has been translated into dozens of foreign languages and made available across the world.It’s part of the ruling party’s sustained efforts to build Xi’s personality globally even as he has fully cemented his power within China, becoming one of its most powerful leaders ever.The CPC wrapped up a key meeting last week, adopting a rare resolution on the party’s history, strengthening Xi’s stature, legacy and future as he looks to secure a precedent-breaking third-term as the country’s leader in late 2022.The use of the SCO Secretariat platform to release the book in multiple languages also gives the CPC’s driven propaganda machinery a chance to gradually access people in 21 countries including its members, three observer countries and nine - including three new - dialogue partners. Iran is transitioning from an observer to full member status.“The works by Xi, general secretary of the CPC central committee, open a window for the SCO countries to understand the CPC and China in the new era,” Xu Lin, deputy head of the CPC central committee’s publicity department and director of the State Council Information Office (SCIO) said at the function, according to a report in the news agency, Xinhua.SCO secretary-general Vladimir Norov and diplomats from Russia, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Sri Lanka, among others, attended the event, the Xinhua report said.According to SCIO, which is the information office of the State Council, China’s cabinet, said in a report that the first volume had sold over 500,000 copies overseas since the foreign language versions were launched in September 2014.“Overall, the book has circulated 6.42mn copies in 24 versions and 21 languages across 160 countries and regions in the world. It is the most popular book by a Chinese leader since the reform and opening up in 1978,” the SCIO said in a report in 2017, probably careful in not comparing it to Mao’s works.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-president-xi-jinping-s-works-now-available-in-hindi-101637244542210.html
18-11-2021||World||Taiwan deploys first advanced F-16V fighter squadron||Taiwan held a ceremony on Thursday to commission the first squadron of its most advanced F-16 fighter, a US-made jet that will strengthen the island's defences against threats by China.President Tsai Ing-wen oversaw the ceremony at an air base in the southern city of Chiayi alongside Sandra Oudkirk, Washington's de facto ambassador to Taiwan."This represents the steadfast promise of the Taiwan-US partnership," Tsai said. "I trust that in holding fast to democratic values, there will definitely be more countries with similar values who will stand with us on this front."The F-16V is an upgraded and much more sophisticated version of Taiwan's other ageing F-16 fighters which date back to the 1990s. The island also has French-made Mirage jets and its own indigenous warplane.A fourth-generation multi-role fighter, the F-16V boasts more advanced radar systems as well as more sophisticated weaponry, navigation and electronic warfare systems.It is however less advanced than fifth-generation fighters like China's J-20, Russia's Su-57 as well as the US-made F-22 and F-35 warplanes.Taiwan is in the middle of upgrading 141 older F-16s to make them the V version and has also ordered 66 new F-16Vs.The deployment of the first squadron comes at a time of soaring tensions between Beijing and Washington over Taiwan's fate.The self-ruled democracy of 23 million is claimed by Beijing which has vowed to one day take the island, by force if needs.The ceremony prompted a fiery response from Beijing at a press briefing, with an official saying "China opposes any official contact between the US and Taiwan".Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian urged the United States not to send "wrong signals to separatist forces", adding that those supporting Taiwan's independence "have spared no effort to split the motherland and collude with foreign forces"."Their actions are akin to throwing an egg against a rock," he said.Chinese sabre-rattling has reached new heights under President Xi Jinping with Beijing sending record numbers of warplanes routinely crossing into Taiwan's air defence zone and state media regularly publicising invasion drills.In the last decade, China has built up its military to the point where Taiwanese and US military officials have publicly voiced fears it could soon pull off an invasion. Washington diplomatically recognises Beijing over Taiwan.But it opposes any attempt to change Taiwan's status by force and is bound by an act of Congress to help the island maintain its own defences.The F-16V deal was approved by the administration of Donald Trump as he feuded with China on a host of issues but his successor Joe Biden has maintained similar support for Taipei.Maintaining Taiwan's defences has become a rare bipartisan issue in Washington. China has lambasted military sales to Taiwan and imposed sanctions on US arms giants such as Boeing, Raytheon and Lockheed Martin in response.jta-bys/axnBOEINGLOCKHEED MARTINRAYTHEON||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-deploys-first-advanced-f-16v-fighter-squadron-101637241886532.html

18-11-2021||World||Europe should not blame Russia for 'all problems': Kremlin||The Kremlin said Thursday that Europe should not blame Russia for "all problems", as tensions with the West simmer over Ukraine and the migrant crisis on the Belarus-Poland border."Russia has an interest in everybody in Europe finally coming to their senses and stopping considering Russia the culprit of all problems," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.He added that Europe should instead "address the primary sources of the problems that are currently suffocating Europe".His remarks come after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday warned Russia against any "military adventurism" on the borders of Ukraine and EU member Poland."Recently there have been a lot of hysterical publications in Britain," Peskov said."Russia is not waging any hybrid wars," he added.Later on Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to address a foreign ministry meeting with "detailed" remarks, Peskov said.NATO and Western governments have denounced a build-up of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine, which has been fighting a war with pro-Russia separatists in its east since 2014.Russia had carried out large-scale drills near the Ukraine border and in annexed Crimea in the spring, sparking concerns of a possible invasion.Kiev, which in recent weeks downplayed the scale of Russia's presence at its borders, said Thursday it was seeking more military aid from the West.Videos circulated recently on social media have shown Russia moving troops, tanks and missiles towards the Ukrainian border."Russia's aggressiveness, both diplomatic and military, has increased considerably in recent weeks," Ukraine's foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba told a press briefing.Ukraine seeks more Western armsThe minister said that after his visits to Washington and Brussels "work is underway to develop a comprehensive package for the containment of Russia".He added that Kiev is in negotiations with the West for "the supply of additional defence weapons for our army".Moscow, in turn, has accused Kiev and the West of warmongering.In a call with French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday, Putin said US-led exercises in the Black Sea were "provocative" and were "increasing tensions" between Moscow and NATO.According to the Elysee, Macron told Putin that France was ready to defend Ukraine's territorial integrity.Some Western governments have also accused Moscow of helping orchestrate the migrant crisis on the Belarus-Poland border.Several thousand migrants -- mostly from the Middle East -- have been staying in makeshift camps on the border in hopes of entering the EU.Brussels has accused Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko of luring the migrants to the border as revenge for sanctions against his regime over last year's crackdown on protests.Lukashenko and the Kremlin have rejected the accusations and criticised the EU for not taking in the migrants.The Belarusian strongman has twice spoken by telephone this week with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in his first direct contacts with a Western leader since last year's disputed presidential election.The Kremlin -- Lukashenko's main political and financial backer -- has welcomed "direct" contacts between Belarus and EU officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-should-not-blame-russia-for-all-problems-kremlin-101637241574569.html
18-11-2021||World||Israel defence minister's cleaner charged with spying for Iran||A man employed in the home of Israeli Defence Minister Benny Gantz was charged Thursday with attempting to spy for the Black Shadow hackers, who are purportedly linked to Iran.According to the indictment published by Israel's justice ministry, Omri Goren Gorochovsky, a 37-year-old resident of the central city of Lod, was arrested on November 4.An arrest warrant for Gorochovsky said he had an extensive criminal history, including five convictions and prison time served for various offences including bank robbery, raising questions as to how he was hired to work in the home of one of Israel's top security officials.In a separate statement, the Shin Bet domestic security agency said Gorochovsky never gained access to "classified materials" and therefore did not successfully share state secrets.Gorochovsky and his partner worked as cleaners in Gantz's home in Rosh Haayin outside Tel Aviv, the indictment says.Late last month, the Black Shadow hackers claimed a cyberattack targeting an Israeli internet service provider which attracted widespread media attention.In Gorochovsky's charge sheet, Black Shadow is described as "affiliated to Iran".Following the high-profile cyberattack, Gorochovsky allegedly contacted Black Shadow via Telegram on or about October 31 with an offer to pass information from Gantz's home.Using a false name, Israel says the suspect "identified himself as someone working in the home of the Israeli minister of defence, and noted his ability to assist the group in various ways".According to the charge sheet, Gorochovsky told a Black Shadow representative that for a "monetary sum" he would convey information via malware that he proposed implanting with a USB device.Family photosTo prove his credibility, the indictment says, Gorochovsky sent photographs of various items in the minister's house.Those included Gantz's work desk, a package with a sticker that contained an IP address, mementoes from Gantz's previous role as Israel's armed forces chief of staff, family photos and a property tax payment receipt.The Shin Bet said the espionage attempt was quickly thwarted, with Gorochovsky arrested just days after he reached out to Black Shadow.The hacking group, which has not acknowledged any link to Israel's arch foe Iran, has been blamed for multiple attacks on Israel's internet infrastructure.In the most recent case, it obtained the database of the largest Israeli LGBTQ dating site and released sensitive personal data, including HIV status, about as many as a million users.The group has also penetrated an Israeli insurance firm, stealing a trove of data and leaking it when its demand for a ransom was not met.Black Shadow hacks are part of a years-long covert war between Israel and Iran including physical attacks on ships and offensive cyber moves online.The Shin Bet said it had also launched an investigation "in order to reduce the chances of recurrence of these kinds of incidents in the future".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-defence-minister-s-cleaner-charged-with-spying-for-iran-101637240656445.html

18-11-2021||World||UK to hold public inquiry into woman's Novichok poisoning||Britain said on Thursday it would hold a public inquiry into the death of a woman who was killed by the Novichok nerve agent following the attempted murder of former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal three years ago.Dawn Sturgess died from exposure to Novichok in July 2018 after her partner found a counterfeit perfume bottle which police believe had been used by Russian intelligence operatives to smuggle the poison into the country.Skripal, who sold Russian secrets to Britain, and his daughter Yulia were found slumped unconscious on a public bench in the southern English city of Salisbury four months earlier.They and a police officer who went to Skripal's house were left critically ill in hospital from exposure to the military-grade nerve agent.While British prosecutors have charged three Russians, who they say are GRU military intelligence officers, in absentia over the attack on Skripal and his daughter, no formal case has been brought against them over the death of Sturgess, 44."This is an important step in ensuring that the family of Dawn Sturgess get the answers they need," Home Secretary (interior minister) Priti Patel said in a statement announcing the public inquiry, to be led by Heather Hallett, a retired senior judge."The government is establishing an inquiry after careful consideration of advice from Baroness Hallett that this is necessary to permit all relevant evidence to be heard," Patel said.Britain says the attempt on Skripal's life was ordered by figures high up in the Russian state, and the incident caused the biggest East-West diplomatic expulsions since the Cold War.Russia has denied any involvement, casting the accusations as anti-Russian propaganda.In September, British police charged the third suspect Sergey Fedotov with conspiracy to murder Skripal, a former GRU officer himself, and attempting to kill him, his daughter Yulia and the police officer.Two other Russians, Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, were charged with the same offences three years ago.In 2016, another British public inquiry concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin had probably approved a Russian intelligence operation to murder ex-KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko with radioactive polonium-210.Two Russians, acting on orders probably directed by Russia’s Federal Security Service, poisoned Litvinenko, an outspoken critic of Putin who fled Russia for Britain, with green tea laced with the radioactive isotope at a plush London hotel, that inquiry concluded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-hold-public-inquiry-into-woman-s-novichok-poisoning-101637239628419.html
18-11-2021||World||Air pollution may lead to increased risk of developing Covid-19: Study||Long-term exposure to air pollution may lead to an increased risk of developing the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) among people who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes Covid-19, according to a recent study. Though the research was conducted in Spain, its results have been published at a time when several cities in India are in the grip of severe air pollution.For the exercise, the researchers tested 9605 participants, of whom 481 (or 5 per cent) were Covid-19 positive. The participants were measured for a series of virus-specific antibodies, with information already available to the researchers on the long-term exposure of such individuals to air pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2), small particulate matter (PM2.5), black carbon and ozone.For a number of volunteers within the total study population, the team was able to establish an association between higher exposure to NO2/PM2.5 and the viral illness, particularly for severe cases that resulted in the patient being hospitalised and, in some cases, being sent to intensive care.In particular, the association with PM2.5 was found to be stronger among men aged 60 and above, as well as people living in socio-economically deprived areas, the researchers said.Speaking on the study, Manolis Kogevinas, its lead author, said, “These results are in line with the association between air pollution and hospitalisation described for other respiratory diseases, including pneumonia and influenza. We have provided the strongest evidence globally on the association of ambient air pollution and Covid-19.”The results of the study were published in the journal Environment Health Perspectives on Wednesday. These provide further evidence on the health benefits of reducing air pollution, and highlight the influence of environmental factors on infectious diseases, the researchers said.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/air-pollution-may-lead-to-increased-risk-of-developing-covid-19-study-101637237275517.html
18-11-2021||World||India, China agree to ease military standoff in eastern Ladakh||India and China agreed on Thursday to ease the ongoing military standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh by shifting from emergency response to “normalised control” of the disputed boundary, a statement from the Chinese foreign ministry said.The two sides have agreed to “consolidate” the results in the areas where troop disengagement has taken place and prepare for and hold the 14th round of military talks soon, the ministry said.The statement was issued after the 23rd round of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs held via video link on Thursday.There was no mention in the Chinese statement of disengagement of troops from the remaining areas of friction such as Depsang and Hot Springs. The two sides have been locked in a military standoff for more than 18 months with bilateral ties plummeting to its worst in decades.“The two sides expressed that in accordance with the consensus spirit of the Dushanbe meeting between the two foreign ministers, they will continue to work hard to further ease the border situation and strive to shift from emergency response to normalised control as soon as possible,” the Chinese foreign ministry statement said.The shift from “emergency response” to “normalised control” was a repeat of what state councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi had told external affairs minister, S Jaishankar during a meeting in Dushanbe in September. “The two sides had a candid and in-depth exchange of views on the recent situation in the China-India border area, and agreed to consolidate the existing disengagement results, strictly abide by the agreements and consensus reached between the two sides, and avoid recurrences in the current situation,” the statement said.“The two sides agreed to maintain dialogue and communication through diplomatic and military channels, actively prepare for the 14th round of military commander-level talks, and make efforts to resolve the remaining issues in the western section of the China-India border,” the Chinese statement added.The last round of military talks between India and China in October had stalled after Beijing said New Delhi had made “unreasonable and unrealistic demands”.The meeting between India’s Ladakh corps commander and China’s South Xinjiang military district commander had taken place on the Chinese side of the Moldo-Chushul border meeting point.A brief statement issued by China’s western theatre command (WTC) and published by several state-run media outlets gave little details of the talks but struck a critical note.India has repeatedly and consistently rejected China’s allegations that Indian troops crossed over to the Chinese side of the LAC in eastern Ladakh, asserting that New Delhi has always taken a responsible approach towards border management and maintaining peace and tranquility in the border areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-china-agree-to-ease-military-standoff-in-eastern-ladakh-101637236923349.html

The UK submarines are scrambling to recover the next-generation F35 jet from the bottom of the sea before Russia could find it, the report said.Britain's ministry of defence earlier said that the jet crashed in an undisclosed location in the Mediterranean Sea, with the pilot safely ejecting and returning to the aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth. Without providing further details, the ministry said that an official probe was launched into the incident."A British F35 pilot from HMS Queen Elizabeth ejected during routine flying operations in the Mediterranean this morning," a spokesperson for the defence ministry said."The pilot has been safely returned to the ship and an investigation has begun, so it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time."The report suggests that the operation involving divers and miniature submarines to recover the jet in shrouded in secrecy as the radar of F35s is hugely sensitive which allows the jet to fly "unseen" in hostile territory and could be valuable for Russia.The multi-role fighter is capable of evading the enemy by flying undetected and entering contested airspace. It can provide close air support, carry out intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions due to its advanced electronic warfare system. The stealth jets also serve as an information and communications gateway, sharing their operational picture with the ground, sea and air assets, according to Lockheed Martin.The F35s, onboard the 3 billion-pound HMS Queen Elizabeth, previously participated in strikes against the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria, according to news agencies.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-submarines-divers-in-race-against-russia-to-find-crashed-f35-fighter-jet-report-101637219803224.html
18-11-2021||World||#MeToo: WTA casts doubt over email attributed to tennis star Peng||The Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) said it has doubts about the authenticity of the email released by Chinese state media attributed to tennis player Peng Shuai, who has not been seen or heard in public since making a sexual assault allegation against a top former Communist Party of China (CPC) official. China’s official broadcaster CCTV’s English channel, CGTN, early on Thursday tweeted an email allegedly from Peng, in which the sports star says she is well and safe. She also goes on to deny the allegations of against former CPC politburo standing committee member, Zhang Gaoli.“Hello, everyone this is Peng Shuai. Regarding the recent news released on the official website of the WTA, the content has not been confirmed or verified by myself and it was released without my consent,” the email says.“The news in that release, including the allegation of sexual assault, is not true. I’m not missing, nor am I unsafe. I’ve just been resting at home and everything is fine. Thank you again for caring about me. If the WTA publishes any more news about me, please verify it with me, and release it with my consent.“As a professional tennis player, I thank you all for your companionship and consideration. I hope to promote Chinese tennis with you all if I have the chance in the future. I hope Chinese tennis will become better and better. Once again, thank you for your consideration,” Peng writes in the email.Earlier this month, Peng, 35, a former Chinese world number one in doubles tennis, had accused former vice-premier Zhang Gaoli, 75, of coercing her into having sex and subsequently continuing an on-and-off secret relationship with her for years.Peng’s allegations against Zhang, made in an emotional post on China’s Twitter-like Weibo, was the first #MeToo allegation against a top CPC leader. The vice-premier was among the seven members of the CPC Politburo Standing Committee, the highest decision-making body in China, between 2013 and 2018, under President Xi Jinping.Peng’s post was swiftly deleted and there’s been no news about her from the time.Reacting to Peng’s letter published by CGTN, Steve Simon, chairman of the WTA, said in a statement he had a “hard time believing” the email was written by Peng.“The statement released today by Chinese state media concerning Peng Shuai only raises my concerns as to her safety and whereabouts,” Smith said in a statement. “I have a hard time believing that Peng Shuai actually wrote the email we received or believes what is being attributed to her.”“Peng Shuai displayed incredible courage in describing an allegation of sexual assault against a former top official in the Chinese government. The WTA and the rest of the world need independent and verifiable proof that she is safe. I have repeatedly tried to reach her via numerous forms of communication, to no avail,” he added.“Peng Shuai must be allowed to speak freely, without coercion or intimidation from any source. Her allegation of sexual assault must be respected, investigated with full transparency and without censorship,” the WTA chief wrote.“The voices of women need to be heard and respected, not censored nor dictated to,” Smith said.Besides the WTA, tennis stars like Naomi Osaka have voiced concerns about Peng’s whereabouts and well-being.“I was recently informed of a fellow tennis player that has gone missing shortly after revealing that she has been sexually abused,” Ms Osaka tweeted with the hashtag #WhereisPengShuai.“I hope Peng Shuai and her family are safe and ok. I’m in shock at the current situation and I’m sending love and light her way,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/metoo-wta-casts-doubt-over-email-attributed-to-tennis-star-peng-101637220540977.html

The two always said they were innocent and offered alibis. No physical evidence linked them to the crime.Malcolm X gained national prominence as the voice of the Nation of Islam, speaking about the importance of Black people claiming their civil rights “by any means necessary" in his highly visible role with the Black Muslim organization.But he later split with the group and, after a trip to Mecca, started speaking about the potential for racial unity. It earned him the ire of some in the Nation of Islam, who saw him as a traitor.Aziz was released in 1985. Islam was released two years later and died in 2009. Both continued to press to clear their names.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-men-convicted-in-malcom-x-s-assassination-to-be-exonerated-today-101637219719372.html

The next full Moon, known as the Beaver, Frost/Frosty, or Snow Moon, is celebrated in many countries as Kartik Purnima, Karthikai Vilakkidu, Thrikarthika, Loi Krathong, Bon Om Touk, and Tazaungdaing.The lunar eclipse will occur on Friday for much of the Earth, except Alaska's time zone westward to the International Date Line in the Pacific Ocean where it will take place on Thursday night. According to Nasa, it will be the longest partial lunar eclipse of the century as the Moon will slip into Earth's shadow for a couple of hours.The duration of the partial lunar eclipse will be about 3 hours and 28 minutes.Lunar Eclipse 2021: Date, time and all that you need to knowNasa executive Gordon Johnston said in a blog post that slight dimming of the Moon will not be noticeable until the Earth’s full shadow begins falling on the upper part of the Moon at 2.18am EST. The near-total eclipse will reach its peak at around 4.03am when over 97% of the Moon will be in full shadow. Johnston added that only a small sliver of the left side of the Moon will shine in the partial shadow of the Earth.In India, the lunar eclipse, or the Chandra Grahan, will start at 12.48pm IST and end at 4.17pm IST. The eclipse will reach its peak around 2.24pm. People in the northeastern part of India will be able to watch this eclipse and won't be visible from the other parts of the country.The full shadow of the Earth is not black due to the planet’s atmosphere."This should be a good month for skywatching, with Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn in the evening sky, a potentially visible comet, and one of the best meteor showers of the year!"

Health officials warned that the number is likely double or triple that.Germany broke its own record again on Thursday as it registered 65,000 new coronavirus infections in 24 hours. This is the first time since the pandemic began that the number has been upward of 60,000 in a single day.At the same time, the head of the country's infectious disease agency the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), Lothar Wieler, warned that number could in fact be much higher."The under-reporting of the true numbers is increasing," Wieler said during an online discussion with Michael Kretschmer, the state premier of Saxony, which is now the epicenter of the pandemic in Germany.ALSO READ: Covid-19: When and where is the infection risk high?Wieler said he believes there were "twice or three times as many" cases a day than were actually being reported."We are in an emergency. Whoever refuses to see that is making a big mistake."Merkel to meet with state premiersWieler's words came as Chancellor Angela Merkelwas preparing to meet with all 16 state premiers on Thursday to discuss implementing nationwide measures in an attempt to avoid the uneven restrictions that have been implemented by state and municipal governments throughout the country.Germany's state of emergency, which has given the federal government tighter control over public health issues, is set to lapse on November 25. The likely future ruling coalition of the Social Democrats (SPD), Green party, and Free Democrats (FDP), had indicated that they would let it expire, despite pleas from state premiers not to do so."If we're really going to be successful in breaking this wave, we're not going to be able to do it by just addressing the unvaccinated group," Kretschmer said ahead of the meeting.Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-germany-shatters-another-record-as-merkel-state-leaders-to-meet-101637214070523.html
18-11-2021||World||Islamic State expanding to nearly all Afghan provinces, Taliban unable to control, warns UN envoy||The UN envoy to Afghanistan on Wednesday said that the regional affiliate of the Islamic State group now appears present in nearly all Afghan provinces and “increasingly active”. Briefing on the Afghanistan situation following the Taliban’s takeover, Deborah Lyons, UN special representative for Afghanistan, told the UN Security Council that the Taliban “appears to rely heavily on extra-judicial detentions and killings” in its response against suspected Islamic State-Khorasan members.“Another major negative development has been the Taliban’s inability to stem the expansion of the Islamic State in Iraq and in Levant Khorasan Province. Once limited to a few provinces and Kabul, ISILKP now seems to be present in nearly all provinces and increasingly active,” Lyons told the Council.IS-K, a sworn enemy of the Taliban, has been responsible for a suicide bombing outside Kabul airport in August and recent multiple bombings in Shia mosques.The UN envoy said the Taliban’s “genuine effort” to present itself as a government are partly constrained by the “lack of resources and capacity”, as well as a “political ideology that clashes with contemporary international norms of governance.” She also highlighted “serious internal division” in the Taliban set-up as an impediment to establishing full trust with much of the Afghan population and convincing them of their capacity to govern.The Taliban’s broader acceptance among the Afghan population has been a cause of concern as the all-male cabinet is largely made of Sunni Pashtuns. The international community has been repeatedly calling for a more inclusive government where women and ethnic minorities get enough representation.“Ultimately, however, the Taliban must decide on whether to govern according to the needs and the rights of the diverse Afghan population, or whether to rule on the basis of a narrow ideology and an even narrower ethnic base,” Lyons added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/islamic-state-expanding-to-nearly-all-afghan-provinces-warns-un-envoy-101637199809017.html

18-11-2021||World||State of emergency in British Columbia; more deaths expected||The Canadian Pacific coast province of British Columbia declared a state of emergency Wednesday following floods and mudslides caused by extremely heavy rainfall, and officials said they expected to find more dead.Every major route between the Lower Mainland of British Columbia, where Canada's third largest city of Vancouver is, and the interior of the province has been cut by washouts, flooding or landslides following record-breaking rain across southern British Columbia between Saturday and Monday. The body of a woman was recovered from one of the mudslides late Monday.“Torrential rains have led to terrible flooding that has disrupted the lives and taken lives of people across B.C. I want people to know that the federal government has been engaging with the local authorities,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in Washington. “We're sending resources like the Canadian Armed Forces to support people but also we'll be there for the cleanup and the rebuilding after impacts of these extreme weather events.”The federal government said it is sending the air force to assist with evacuations and to support supply lines.Military helicopters already helped evacuate about 300 people from one highway where people were trapped in their cars Sunday night following a mudslide,“We expect to confirm even more fatalities in the coming days,” British Columbia Premier John Horgan said.Horgan called it a once in a 500 year event. He said the state of emergency will include travel restrictions so the transport of essential goods medical and emergency services will reach the communities that need them. He asked people not to hoard goods.“These are very challenging times. I've been at this dais for two years now talking about challenging times we have faced — unprecedented challenges with public health, wildfires, heat domes and now debilitating floods that we have never seen before,” Horgan said.Horgan said over the past six months there have been drought conditions in Merritt, where the river was at its lowest point in living memory and where people had to be evacuated because of wildfires in temperatures that were unprecedented. And now, he said, much of the community is under water.The weather events are all connected and can be attributed to climate change, said John Clague, a professor in the Earth Sciences Department at Simon Fraser University.“Scientists are now saying these particular events, they’re becoming more frequent, exacerbated or ramped up by climate change,” he said.The record temperatures in the summer set the stage for the wildfires, said Clague. The fires burned the ground in a way that prevents water from seeping into the soil. He said that resulted in the water from the torrential rains pouring more quickly into steams and rivers, causing floods.The total number of people and vehicles unaccounted for had not yet been confirmed near the town of Lillooet. Investigators had received reports of two other people who were missing but added that other motorists might have been buried in a slide on Highway 99.Elsewhere in the province, Abbotsford Mayor Henry Braun said residents of the low-lying Sumas Prairie area south of the city face a significant risk to life and must get out immediately.An evacuation order was issued for about 1,000 properties Tuesday as flooding linked to a severe weekend rainstorm pushed up water levels in the area which is home to many large dairy farms and other agricultural and livestock operations.Braun said in a news briefing Wednesday that conditions were dire overnight because a key pumping station was in danger of being overwhelmed. The station was the only thing keeping water from the nearby Fraser River from engulfing most of the Sumas Prairie flats, he said.“Right now, things are holding steady,” Braun said of the situation at the Barrowtown Pump Station. Crews spent Tuesday night sandbagging around the station.“I’m feeling much better today than last night,” he said, although he cautioned the danger has not passed and river levels, which have dropped two meters since the storm ended, must drop further before flood gates can be opened to allow even more water to escape.Abbotsford Fire Chief Darren Lee said about 180 rescues were completed Tuesday and early Wednesday as trapped residents asked for help to leave their flooded properties.“Overnight we actually brought in additional helicopters when we realized the flooding was worsening in the east Prairie area,” he said. Three helicopters carried people to safety overnight, said Lee, while 11 teams in boats also brought out trapped residents.No one was unaccounted for, Abbotsford Police Chief Mike Serr said.About 80 callers were still awaiting help by daylight and responders planned to “work through the queue” through the morning, he said.Agriculture Minister Lana Popham said thousands of animals had died and the province was rushing to get veterinarians to other animals that are in danger.``I can also tell you that many farmers attempted to move animals and then had to walk away because the roads were disappearing beneath them,″ she said.A trade expert said the loss of major transportation routes will hurt the movement of goods both in and out Canada’s largest port in Vancouver.“Vancouver really has an outsized role to play in our Pacific trade,” said Werner Antweiler, an associate professor at the UBC Sauder School of Business. “Commodities will be impacted in a much more significant way because it’s coming by rail or coming by big trucks.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/state-of-emergency-in-british-columbia-more-deaths-expected-101637191729011.html
18-11-2021||World||Twenty-five civilians killed in Niger's lawless west||Suspected jihadists killed 25 civilians in Niger in a lawless desert region near the border with Mali, local officials said on Wednesday.Niger, the world's poorest country by the benchmark of the UN's Human Development Index, faces jihadist insurgencies both on its western flank abutting Mali and Burkina Faso and in the southeast on the border with Nigeria.An interior ministry statement said the attack on Tuesday in the town of Bakorat in the vast Tahoua desert region bordering Mali had killed 25 people, wounded one more, and scorched two vehicles.In another attack on Temaram in the same region, "unidentified armed individuals" also ransacked the town hall and a health centre, and plundered two money transfer shops, the ministry added.It said a security sweep was ongoing in those areas.Two officials earlier said 10 civilians were killed in the clash in Bakorat, which one of them said pitted the gunmen against a self-defence militia in Bakorat.The Air Info newspaper cited a survivor as saying, "The assailants arrived... aboard six 4x4s preceded by several motorbikes."Tuesday's deadly attack was just the latest in the area, where self-defence militias have sprung up in recent weeks.On November 5, 11 soldiers were killed and nine were reported missing following a jihadist attack on an army position in Dagne, in the vast Tillaberi region.The soldiers targeted had been deployed to ensure the safety of the thousands of villagers who had returned to their communities after yet more killings just three days earlier.That assault on the village of Adab-Dab, also in Tillaberi region, killed at least 69 people, including a local mayor.'Innocent people' The insurgency in the west of the country of 25 million people began in 2015, escalating in 2017 with massacres carried out by groups affiliated to Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group.Human Rights Watch estimated in August that more than 420 civilians had been killed since the start of the year in western Niger.On January 2, 100 people were killed in attacks on two villages.The massacre, one of the worst in the history of the former French colony, occurred between two rounds of the country's presidential election.In March, 141 members of the Tuareg community were massacred in Tahoua.In September, President Mohamed Bazoum, making his first visit to the region since being elected in February, said the attacks on "unarmed innocent people" were a sign the jihadists were losing ground against the army.But on October 20, 11 members of the National Guard and a gendarme were killed in an ambush on a regional prefect's motorcade in the Bankilare district.In early October the UN warned that the Tillaberi region was facing a "major food crisis", with almost 600,000 people exposed to food insecurity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twentyfive-civilians-killed-in-niger-s-lawless-west-101637185375461.html
18-11-2021||World||15 shot dead in crackdown on Sudan anti-coup protests||Sudanese security forces shot dead at least 15 anti-coup protesters and wounded dozens more on Wednesday, medics said, in the bloodiest day since the military's October 25 takeover.The fatalities -- all in Khartoum, especially its northern districts -- raised to 39 the death toll from unrest since the military seized power, a pro-democracy doctors' union said. Hundreds more have been wounded."The day's massacre reinforces our slogans: no negotiations, no partnership, no compromise" with the military, said protest organisers from the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA).Demonstrators had taken to the streets across the capital even though telephone lines and internet services had been disrupted since the military took over, AFP journalists reported."The people choose civilian rule," demonstrators chanted, also shouting slogans against Sudan's ruler, top general Abdel Fattah al-Burhan.The demonstrators, mostly young men and women, clapped hands and ululated before the scene turned violent.As clashes broke out, the security forces also fired tear gas, injuring several more protesters, witnesses said.Police have denied using live ammunition and state television announced an investigation into the deaths.The doctors' union said most of the casualties had suffered gunshot wounds to "the head, neck or torso", but added that the demonstrators, undeterred and behind makeshift barricades, kept up their protests.Demonstrations also erupted in Port Sudan, an AFP journalist said, against the coup which halted a democratic transition that followed the 2019 toppling of longtime dictator Omar al-Bashir."It was a very bad day for the protesters," Soha, a 42-year-old protester, told AFP. "I saw a person with gunshot wounds behind me and there were a lot of arrests" in Khartoum.Demonstrations after nightfall Hundreds remained on the streets after nightfall, especially in northern Khartoum where tear gas fire reached inside hospitals, doctors said. Rallies in other cities dispersed.Efforts to stem the protests have seen hundreds arrested, including activists, passers-by and journalists. Qatari network Al Jazeera's bureau chief was arrested Sunday and released Tuesday.The Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors has said security forces have also arrested injured people inside Khartoum hospitals.The SPA, an umbrella of unions instrumental in the 2019 protests, denounced "immense crimes against humanity" and accused the security forces of "premeditated killings".US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Sudan's military the country stood to regain badly needed international aid if it restored the "legitimacy" of civilian government.Washington has suspended some $700 million in assistance to Sudan since the coup."If the military puts this train back on its tracks and does what's necessary, I think the support that has been very strong from the international community can resume," said Blinken.Prior to 2019, Sudan had been under some form of military dictatorship for much of its modern history.US shuttle diplomacy Burhan has declared a state of emergency, ousted the government and detained the civilian leadership, derailing a transition to full civilian rule and drawing international condemnation.He insists the military's move "was not a coup".US Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Molly Phee has been shuttling between the generals and the ousted civilian government in a bid to broker a way out of the crisis.Phee has called for the reinstatement of ousted Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, who is effectively under house arrest.The few remaining free members of his cabinet continue to describe themselves as the "legitimate" government and refuse to negotiate with the military leaders.While some of the civilian leaders have been freed since the power grab, new ones have been arrested.Burhan last week announced a new Sovereign Council, the highest transitional authority, with himself as chief and all nine military members keeping their posts.Its four civilian members were replaced.Burhan has also removed a clause in the transitional constitutional declaration that mentions the Forces for Freedom and Change, the key group behind the protests that toppled Bashir.He has continued to promise elections will go ahead as planned in 2023, reiterating to Phee on Tuesday that his actions aimed to "correct the trajectory of the revolution".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/15-shot-dead-in-crackdown-on-sudan-anti-coup-protests-101637183323702.html
18-11-2021||World||Canada sends military to flood-ravaged Pacific coast||Canada is sending the military to help evacuate and support communities hit by "extreme flooding" after record rainfall on the Pacific coast, the government said Wednesday.Downpours in British Columbia this week trapped motorists in mudslides that left at least one dead and two missing, forced thousands to flee their homes, and cut off Vancouver and its port."In response to extreme flooding across Southern BC, we have approved the deployment of @CanadianForces air support personnel to assist with evacuation efforts, support supply chain routes, and protect residents against floods and landslides," Public Safety Minister Bill Blair said on Twitter.A spokesperson told AFP the military was still sorting out the details of the deployment.In Washington, ahead of a meeting with his US and Mexican counterparts, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the rains caused "historical and terrible flooding that has disrupted the lives and taken lives of people across B.C."He pledged federal support, saying: "We'll be there for the cleanup and the rebuilding after the impacts of these extreme weather events."Airlifted to safetyThe torrential rains had let up by Tuesday afternoon. An estimated 300 motorists trapped on highways by mudslides have been airlifted to safety and a few of a dozen evacuation orders have been rescinded.Meanwhile, searches continue for more possible victims, after police announced late Tuesday the recovery of a woman's body from a mudslide near Lillooet, 250 kilometers (155 miles) north of Vancouver.Television images showed several towns east of the Vancouver covered in mud and partially inundated, with residents now scrambling for food, heat and water -- as the first snow flurries of the season started to fall.On the outskirts of Vancouver, a large fire broke out at an RV dealership in the flooded Sumas Prairie, and farmers scrambled to pull livestock from the water.Abbotsford Mayor Henry Braun and emergency officials told a news conference almost 200 people had been airlifted overnight to safety, after the city of 162,000 warned a pump station was at risk of being overwhelmed due to the Nooksack River carrying a surge of water north from the United States.Most of the area is farmland created by draining Sumas Lake in the 1920s.The pump station, Braun said, "was never intended or designed to take on water from another country."Some highways, meanwhile, remain closed. As a result, motorists wanting to travel to or from Vancouver have to travel south to the United States and back up into Canada.Landslides also cut off rail traffic to and from Vancouver -- one of Canada's busiest freight sea ports.Across the province, people are reportedly finding grocery store shelves empty.Environment Canada said up to 250 millimetres (almost 10 inches) of rain -- what the region normally gets in a month -- fell Sunday and Monday in and around Vancouver, which was also hit last week by a rare tornado.The extreme weather comes after British Columbia suffered record-high temperatures over the summer that killed more than 500 people, as well as wildfires that destroyed a town.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-sends-military-to-flood-ravaged-pacific-coast-101637174703559.html

Pakistan, Iran and UAE are among the other nations that have provided Afghanistan with food and medical supplies. More than half of the country’s nearly 40 million people are likely to face acute food shortage and nine million are already on brink of starvation, according to a recent World Food Program report. Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan had said that his country would “favorably consider the request by Afghan brothers for transportation of wheat offered by India through Pakistan on exceptional basis,” in a statement after a Nov. 12 meeting with Afghanistan’s Acting Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi. There was no immediate comment from Pakistan officials Monday.Last month Pakistan had denied India’s request to send the wheat because of the fractious relationship between the two South Asian nations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-allows-india-to-send-wheat-to-afghanistan-as-starvation-crisis-grows-101637156700610.html
18-11-2021||World||Maldives rejects ‘India Out’ campaign, describes India as ‘closest ally’||The Maldives government on Wednesday rejected what it said were attempts to spread “false information” through social media using the “India Out” slogan, and described India as the country’s “closest ally and trusted neighbour”.The government in Male issued a statement in response to a fresh campaign in the media and social media that alleged cooperation between the governments of the two countries is undermining the national security and sovereignty of the Maldives.The statement said the strong relationship between the Maldives and India is based on shared historical and cultural ties and matched by dynamic people-to-people contacts. “India has always been the Maldives’ closest ally and trusted neighbour, extending constant and consistent support to the people of Maldives on all fronts,” it said.Though the statement did not name anybody, it is believed opposition parties and a section of the media in the Maldives have been engaged in renewed efforts to whip up anti-India sentiments. The “India Out” slogan was first used on social media platforms last year.Recent media reports, especially in Dhiyares and its sister newspaper The Maldives Journal, have sought to create an impression that India is seeking to establish a military presence in the Maldives through ongoing security cooperation.The Maldives government’s statement coincided with the new Indian high commissioner, Munu Mahawar, presenting his credentials to President Ibrahim Solih at an official ceremony. Solih “highlighted that the Maldives and India share a special relationship and that no third nation can take India’s place”, according to a readout from the president’s office.Solih and the Indian envoy spoke about strengthening bilateral relations, especially in security cooperation, socio-economic development and climate change.The Maldives government’s statement said cooperation and support provided by India, specifically on issues of maritime security, is “aimed at strengthening the strategic partnership between the two countries and to ensure the safety and stability of the Indian Ocean region”.It added: “Support provided by India, on areas such as search and rescue capabilities, casualty evacuation, coastal surveillance, and maritime reconnaissance, directly benefit the Maldivian people. The Government of Maldives has also established partnerships with other countries in similar areas of cooperation, to enhance technical and strategic capacities.”Maldives defence minister Mariya Didi recently told Raajje TV that none of the Indian military personnel present on Maldivian soil “carry weapons” and their presence poses no risk to national sovereignty.The statement further noted that no country could tackle threats such as trans-border terrorism, piracy and narco-trafficking and non-traditional challenges such as climate change, cyber security and human trafficking without the support and cooperation of regional and international partners.The Maldives government also reiterated its gratitude for the assistance provided by India over the years, including during the 1988 mercenary attack on the country, the 2004 Asian tsunami, the 2015 Male water crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic.Describing the false allegations regarding ties with India as misguided and unsubstantiated, the Maldives government these were the views of a “small group of individuals with the objective of tarnishing the country’s long-standing cordial ties with India”.
