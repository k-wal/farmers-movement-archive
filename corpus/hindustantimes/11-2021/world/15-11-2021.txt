15-11-2021||World||Attendance of girls dip after final exams cancelled in Afghanistan's Herat||The attendance of girl students has dropped as Herat provincial school teachers' council decided to cancel annual examinations and promote them to the next grade without appearing for end-term examinations.Educational officials in Herat province of Afghanistan said school teachers' council's decision to waive off annual examinations and promote students to the next scheduled grade was the reason for the reluctance of girl students to attend schools, reported Afghanistan's TOLOnews."The student of grade seven will be directly promoted to grade eight. The students of grade 12 will be graduated from school. And therefore some disorder is resulting at schools," TOLOnews quoted Mohammad Sabir Mashal, head of the council as saying.The government had last week permitted girl students from grades 7th to 12th in the Herat province to attend schools. Out of 34 provinces in Afghanistan, education of girls from grades 7th to 12th is not allowed in 27 provinces.Some of the students requested educational officials to incorporate annual examinations and mentioned that the revocation of exams would hamper their studies, reported TOLONews.A girl student of class 12 said, "The students of grade 12 have their university entrance ahead and they should have full preparation for entrance. When the private institutions are closed and they also don't take our examinations, it really affects our future," reported TOLOnews.The Taliban, after taking control of the country in mid-August, had closed the schools with thousands of girl students confined to their homes, attracting criticism by the international community. The Islamic Emirate which banned girl schools for grades 7 to 12 in many provinces, claimed earlier that they are working to provide a safe environment for female students in Afghanistan.A teacher, stressing the significance of examinations said, "If there is no education, there is no hope for the next year among the students. The motivation that the students have recently found will be lost again," reported TOLOnews.After months of discussions regarding girl education among the council, officials of the girls' schools and the Taliban's local officials in Herat, they were permitted to attend school.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/attendance-of-girls-dip-after-final-exams-cancelled-in-afghanistan-s-herat-101636997529013.html
15-11-2021||World||US-China summit: Biden to tell Xi to ‘play by the rules of the road’||US President Joe Biden plans to tell Chinese President Xi Jinping in their first face-to-face virtual meeting on Monday that he must “play by the rules of the road” as responsible nations do on everything from technology to trade to international institutions and international waterways.The American leader will also make clear to his Chinese counterpart that he intends to “build commonsense guardrails” to avoid miscalculation or misunderstanding about the relationship between the two countries, a senior Biden administration said previewing the meeting on condition of anonymity.The two nations, the official said starkly describing the current state of relationship, are in a “fundamentally different place with each other than we have been in the past”.The Monday evening meeting will be the first face-to-face meeting - virtually - between the two leaders who have had extensive telephone conversations on two occasions before, the most recent of which was on September 9.The official sought to tamp down expectations from the meeting, which is expected to last some hours, saying, “this meeting is about our ongoing efforts to responsibly manage the competition not about agreeing to a specific deliverable or outcome” and setting the terms of the competition will be an ongoing effort and this meeting between the two leaders is one step in that.President Biden has sought to define the relationship with China as one of intense competition between the world’s two largest economies in which the United States will seek to force China to play by the rules, working with allies and partners, and keep thorny issues of human rights in Xinjiang, democracy in Hong Kong and Taiwan on the table.The delusional goal of changing China through engagement as pursued by past administrations - not so much by the previous dispensation led by President Donald Trump - has no purchase from Biden. “Unlike previous approaches to your policy with respect to China, the Biden administration is not trying to change China through bilateral engagement. We don’t think that’s realistic,” the official said.The US is going into the meeting with a three-point agenda. One, Biden will emphasise the need for “commonsense guardrails” and keeping communication lines open. Two, the US president will raise areas of concern about “threats we see to the rules based international order, unfair economic behaviour, such as China’s extraordinary supportive of industry and its practice of economic coercion, its human rights practices” and its “provocative behaviour” with respect to Taiwan. Three, the two leaders will also seek to further cooperation in areas of mutual agreement such as climate change and health.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uschina-summit-biden-to-tell-xi-to-play-by-the-rules-of-the-road-101636981402135.html
15-11-2021||World||In his book, Ban ki-Moon talks about his time as ex-UN secy general; mentions Tharoor||In an upcoming book on his days as the United Nations secretary-general, Ban ki-Moon reveals some behind the scenes details of his competition with Congress Member of Parliament Shashi Tharoor for the top job and how a spat with the Indian envoy to the UN led to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh sending a top aide to make amends with him.The book ‘Resolved’ published by Harper Collins will be out by the end of the week and tells the story of the 10 years that Ban ki-Moon spent doing what is often described as the “most impossible job in the world.’’ A career diplomat, he reveals his special relationship with India where he not only got his first posting but also where his son was born while his youngest daughter is married to an Indian. “Even now, nearly fifty years later, I tell the Indian people that half of my heart belongs in their country,’’ Moon writes in the book.In the 376-page-long book, he contradicts the perception that the Manmohan Singh government backed Tharoor’s candidacy for the top job at the UN. At the time, Tharoor was already a long-serving diplomat at the UN, having served there for more than two decades. In the run-up to the race in 2006, Tharoor met Prime Minister Singh and was confident about his chances. “Obviously we will not be in the race if we didn’t believe there were reasonable prospects for success,” he told reporters after his meeting. However, in the book, Moon reveals that a different impression prevailed in the UN.“It was rumoured that Shashi Tharoor did not enjoy the Indian government’s support, but the fact that he received ten votes made me anxious,’’ he writes in his book. To win, the claimants needed to get a majority of the Security Council 15-members on their side and Tharoor lagged behind Moon by two votes before finally overcoming a veto from France. In the end, Ban ki-Moon won with 14 votes and Tharoor left the UN in 2007, before successfully campaigning and winning the Lok Sabha election from ThiruvananthapuramHindustan Times reached out to Tharoor to comment on Moon’s statement but didn’t receive any response.Tharoor isn’t the only high profile diplomat to figure in Moon’s memoir. The book also mentions his run-in with India’s envoy to the UN about restructuring peacekeeping forces. “Indian Ambassador Nirupam Sen even criticized me publicly, telling a New York Times journalist, “the secretary-general is not the king and the member states are not the subjects of the king. Upon my complaint, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh later sent his senior advisor to apologize, and he recalled Ambassador Sen soon afterwards,’’ he writes without naming the messenger despatched by PM Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-his-book-ban-ki-moon-s-talks-about-his-time-as-ex-un-secy-general-mentions-tharoor-101636979002269.html
15-11-2021||World||China, US gear up for first Xi-Biden virtual summit as Taiwan looms||China’s position and concerns over US policies on Taiwan will likely top the discussion agenda when Chinese President Xi Jinping meets US counterpart Joe Biden during a virtual summit on Tuesday.Chinese state-controlled media said on Monday that Beijing will ask Washington to “step back” on its policies and statements on the self-ruled and democratic island, which China claims as a breakaway region.The situation in Afghanistan, bilateral trade, nuclear proliferation and cybersecurity are likely to be discussed during the talks.The meeting will be the first one-on-one meeting between Xi and Biden via video link, the first since Biden took office in January. The two leaders have had two phone conversations, in February and September.On Saturday, state councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi told US secretary of state, Anthony Blinken that “…any connivance of and support for the ‘Taiwan independence’ forces undermines peace across the Taiwan Strait and would only boomerang in the end”.The Chinese foreign ministry on Monday said China “…firmly opposed the wrong words of US secretary of state Antony Blinken about the Taiwan region, which are against the consensus reached between China and the US when the two countries established diplomatic ties”.“The US should abide by the One-China principle and the three China-US joint communiques, the important consensus and political foundation of the two countries,” ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian said.Zhao said currently “…Sino-US relations are at a critical crossroads. This video meeting is a major event in Sino-US relations as well as in international relations”.Zhao said Xi and Biden will have a candid and in-depth exchange of views on strategic issues related to the future of China-US relations and important issues of mutual concern.For China, however, the issue of Taiwan is likely to top the talks’ agenda. “The Taiwan question is the ultimate red line of China…In order to reduce the risk of a strategic collision between China and the US, the latter must take a step back from the Taiwan question and show its restraint,” the Global Times wrote in an editorial on Monday.“However, the two sides are unlikely to reach any consensus on this question as there is still strong motivation inside the US government to continue playing the Taiwan card, which is seen as one of Washington’s most useful leverages,” Xin Qiang from the Centre for American Studies at Shanghai’s Fudan University told the Global Times.It is likely that Xi would impress upon Biden that Beijing is resolved to “realise national reunification in the foreseeable future no matter the cost”, another editorial in state-run China Daily newspaper said.Reuters quoted experts saying China’s emphasis on Taiwan amid other friction points reflects its reluctance to be drawn into armed conflict with the US unnecessarily, despite its recent words and actions, including sending an unprecedented number of planes into Taiwan’s air defence zone.“Chinese leaders are aware that China has not completed its modernisation and still faces many challenges in its domestic economy,” Li Mingjiang from the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore told Reuters.Besides fraught ties over a range of issues from trade ties to human rights and transparency over the origins of Covid-19 pandemic, Tuesday’s Xi-Biden meeting will take place in the backdrop of rapid developments in Afghanistan.In September, Xi had told Biden during a phone conversation that the US’ China policy has resulted in serious difficulties in bilateral ties and runs counter to the fundamental interests of the two countries and the common interests of the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-us-gear-up-for-first-xi-biden-virtual-summit-as-taiwan-looms-101636974501644.html

It is smaller than many outbreaks in other countries but authorities in China are anxious to block the transmission under the government's zero-tolerance guidance.A dozen province-level regions contained their flare-ups within weeks, thanks to quick implementation of a complex set of curbs, including rigorous contact tracing, multiple rounds of testing of people in at risk areas, the closure of entertainment and cultural venues and restrictions on tourism and public transport.However, the northeastern city of Dalian is locked in a struggle with the virus, Wu Liangyou, an official at the National Health Commission, told a Saturday news briefing.Since Dalian's first local symptomatic patients from the latest outbreak was reported on Nov. 4, the city of 7.5 million people has detected an average of about 24 new local cases a day, more than any other Chinese cities, according to Reuters calculation.A few cities near Dalian, including Dandong, Anshan and Shenyang, have said that people arriving from Dalian had to be quarantined at centralised facilities for 14 days before they can move freely.As of Nov. 14, mainland China had reported 98,315 confirmed coronavirus cases with symptoms, including domestically transmitted infections and those from overseas. There have been 4,636 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-battles-biggest-delta-outbreak-as-infections-grow-in-northeastern-city-101636958474694.html
15-11-2021||World||'Second chance': Family of Indian-origin man on death row in Singapore pleads||The sister of a Malaysian man facing imminent execution despite concerns he is mentally disabled has pleaded with Singapore to give him a "second chance".Nagaenthran K. Dharmalingam, sentenced to death in 2010 for trafficking a small amount of heroin into Singapore, was originally set to be hanged last week after losing a series of appeals.The execution in the city-state, which has some of the world's toughest drugs laws, was postponed after the 33-year-old contracted the coronavirus, but campaigners fear the delay will be short.His family are not giving up, however, with his sister Sarmila Dharmalingam urging the city-state to "give him a second chance"."We hope the Singapore government will spare his life," the 35-year-old told AFP in an interview Sunday from the family home in Tanjung Rambutan, in the northern Malaysian state of Perak."He is suffering from an intellectual disability."Nagaenthran's case has sparked a storm of criticism, with the European Union and United Nations rights experts speaking out against it, and a clemency petition getting around 85,000 signatures.A last-ditch court challenge is being mounted and while chances of success look slim, Sarmila and her family are holding out hope."All our family members are holding prayers for his life to be spared," said the housewife, who is ethnic Indian and a member of the Hindu minority in mostly Muslim Malaysia."I believe in miracles... With God's grace, a miracle will happen."Last-ditch challengeNagaenthran was arrested aged 21 as he tried to enter Singapore from neighbouring Malaysia with a bundle of heroin weighing about 43 grams -- equivalent to about three tablespoons -- strapped to his thigh.Campaigners say he has an IQ of just 69, a level recognised as an intellectual disability, was coerced into transporting the drugs, and was struggling with an alcohol problem at the time.But Singapore, which insists the death penalty is an effective deterrent against crime, has shown little sign of heeding calls for clemency.The home affairs ministry said earlier this month that psychiatrists had stated during previous court proceedings that Nagaenthran was not intellectually disabled.Legal rulings also concluded that he "clearly understood the nature of his acts", which were aimed at paying off debts, it said in a statement.A written appeal from Malaysia's Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob was also brushed off, with his Singapore counterpart Lee Hsien Loong responding that Nagaenthran had been given "full due process under the law".'He wants to come home'Sarmila -- one of Nagaenthran's three siblings -- recalled the shock when her family received a letter from Singapore authorities on October 26 informing them her brother would be hanged on November 10.Preparations for the Hindu festival of Diwali were halted so the family could figure out how his mother, who works as a cleaner, and other relatives could travel to Singapore to see him before the execution.Naganethran's eldest sister, Sarmila struggles to accept her brother is a convicted drug smuggler and still has fond memories of playing childhood games with him.He was a "lovable person. He was very caring", she said.During more than a decade behind bars, Nagaenthran developed a passion for arts and crafts, making cards for his family back home to mark occasions such as Mother's Day.His sister believes he was coerced into drug smuggling, as he was "timid and easily influenced by others".Rights groups, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, say the planned execution would breach international laws against capital punishment for people with mental disabilities.If it goes ahead, it would be the first hanging in Singapore since 2019.During recent prison visits, relatives have found Nagaenthran "erratic and depressed", according to Sarmila."He knows he is going to be hanged but... he says he wants to come home and take care of his mother," she said.Fighting back tears as she clutched a photo of Nagaenthran as a child, she pleaded: "I want my brother to come home."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/second-chance-family-of-indian-origin-man-on-death-row-in-singapore-pleads-101636954947919.html

The scene grew out of control as fans surged toward the stage."The Blount family tonight is grieving the incomprehensible loss of their precious young son," said attorney Ben Crump. "This should not have been the outcome of taking their son to a concert."Crump has said that any one of several concert officials could have prevented deaths and injuries by stopping the show and turning on the house lights when the chaos in the crowd became apparent.Crump and other attorneys for those hurt at the festival have filed scores of lawsuits against Scott and the organizers, alleging negligence in crowd control, failure to provide proper medical attention and a lack of emergency preparations, among other issues.Scott on Thursday asked victims and their families to reach out to him, saying he "desperately wishes to share his condolences and provide aid," according to a statement. The rapper earlier offered to pay for funeral costs and mental health counseling.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/houston-concert-stampede-9-year-old-succumbs-toll-climbs-to-10-101636951607683.html

When their lawyers moved the higher court for suspension of the conviction, the case was adjourned till last week of July.Rana M Shamim, the former chief judge of supreme appellate court of Gilgit Baltistan, said, “Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz Sharif must remain in jail until the general elections are over. On assurances from the other side, he (Saqib Nisar) became calm and happily demanded another cup of tea.” He said the directions were given to a judge of another court who was not named in the affidavit.An article published in Pakistani daily The News International said Shamim gave his statement under oath before the oath commissioner on November 10, 2021. The notarised affidavit contained Shamim’s signature and an image of his national identity card (NIC).According to the article, the former chief justice has categorically denied the allegations and stated that he never issued any direction to any of his subordinates regarding judicial proceedings related to Sharif or anyone else.Shamim said he was witness to the incident that happened at the guest house of Gilgit Baltistan court when Nisar came on a vacation with his family members. Shamim added that when he asked the former chief justice why he conveyed such a message to the other judge, he said, “Rana Sahib you will never understand. You must treat it as if you never heard anything”.When he further said that Sharif had been falsely implicated, Nisar said, “Rana Sahib the chemistry of Punjab is different from Gilgit Baltistan.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-pak-cji-didn-t-want-nawaz-sharif-maryam-to-be-free-before-2018-polls-101636945983756.html

Many soldiers carried American made-M4 assault rifles.Most of the weapons and equipment the Taliban forces are now using are those supplied by Washington to the American-backed government in Kabul in a bid to construct an Afghan national force capable of fighting the Taliban.Those forces melted away with the fleeing of Afghan President Ashraf Ghani from Afghanistan - leaving the Taliban to take over major military assets.Taliban officials have said that pilots, mechanics and other specialists from the former Afghan National Army would be integrated into a new force, which has also started wearing conventional military uniforms in place of the traditional Afghan clothing normally worn by their fighters.According to a report late last year by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (Sigar), the US government transferred to the Afghan government more than $28 billion worth of defence articles and services, including weapons, ammunition, vehicles, night-vision devices, aircraft, and surveillance systems, from 2002 to 2017.Some of the aircraft were flown into neighbouring Central Asian Countries by fleeing Afghan forces, but the Taliban have inherited other aircraft. It remains unclear how many are operational.As the U.S. troops departed, they destroyed more than 70 aircraft, dozens of armoured vehicles and disabled air defences before flying out of Kabul's Hamid Karzai International Airport following a chaotic evacuation operation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-show-of-strength-taliban-hold-military-parade-with-us-made-weapons-in-kabul-101636941220016.html

She spent three days that way, until she finally died.The eruption was considered the worst natural disaster in Colombian history and one of the deadliest volcanic eruptions of the 20th century.Now, Nevado del Ruiz has been in "a period of instability for more than 11 years," the geological service said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/volcano-that-wiped-out-entire-town-in-colombia-is-active-again-101636922188659.html
