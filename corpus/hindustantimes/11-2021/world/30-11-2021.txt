In addition, they can adversely impact global health efforts during a pandemic by disincentivising countries to report and share epidemiological and sequencing data," the WHO said in a travel advice statement on Omicron.It added that people vulnerable to developing severe Covid-19 disease, including the over-60s, should be advised to postpone travel."Persons who are unwell or at risk of developing severe Covid-19 disease and dying, including people 60 years of age or older or those with co-morbidities (e.g. heart disease, cancer and diabetes), should be advised to postpone travel," the WHO said in a travel advice statement on Omicron.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/blanket-travel-bans-will-not-prevent-omicron-spread-says-who-101638294842066.html
30-11-2021||World||Germany moves toward mandatory Covid-19 shots as Europe clamps down||Germany took a step closer toward making Covid-19 vaccinations compulsory as the incoming chancellor threw his support behind the move, part of a tougher line by European leaders as the pandemic spirals out of control.Olaf Scholz called for a parliamentary vote on the step before the end of the year, saying on Tuesday that he would allow lawmakers to make the decision.“My recommendation is that we don’t do this as a government, because it’s an issue of conscience,” he said on Tuesday in an online interview with the Bild newspaper.Scholz and outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel met with state premiers to discuss the country’s outbreak. While the measure wasn’t approved at the talks, there’s a growing consensus across the political spectrum that shots will have to be required.“Almost all are in agreement that we’re moving forward on the issue of general mandatory vaccination,” Markus Soeder, the conservative premier of Bavaria, said after a meeting with Merkel, Scholz and other state leaders. A vaccine mandate would be a major departure for the new administration after German leaders vowed for months that it would let citizens to decide if they wanted to take up the government’s offer to get inoculated. The soft tone may have contributed to the country’s relatively low vaccination rate of less than 70%.Scholz, Merkel and the heads of Germany’s 16 states discussed a number of proposals to impose new curbs, including restrictions on unvaccinated people, limiting fans at soccer games and closing bars and nightclubs in hard-hit areas. They will meet again on Thursday to make final decisions. “There is agreement that the fourth wave of the pandemic has led to an extremely serious -- and in some regions dramatic -- situation in our health system,” Steffen Seibert, Merkel’s chief spokesman, said in an emailed statement. “The federal and state governments will respond together and in resolute fashion.” The latest surge in infections appears to have caught German authorities by surprise, and the transition to a new administration under Social Democrat Scholz has complicated pandemic coordination in Europe’s largest economy. States led by Merkel’s conservative bloc, which is moving into opposition, also called for the new government to prepare for mandatory vaccinations, as well as hard contact restrictions for unvaccinated people, reduced capacity for large events and the shuttering of clubs, according to a document seen by Bloomberg.Pressure has been growing ahead of the change in power and the gathering allowed the politicians to address a Constitutional Court ruling on Tuesday, which rejected challenges to measures such as nighttime curfews and closing schools. The decision could give leaders additional legal backing for a new round of tougher restrictions, but they’re unlikely to impose a widespread lockdown.Alongside possible new measures in Germany, Norway extended quarantine rules for people testing positive for Covid, while Greece made Covid vaccines compulsory for people above 60, including a monthly fine of 100 euros ($114) a month for those who don’t comply. Switzerland and Finland also are considering tighter curbs to clamp down on public contact. France is also bracing for a worsening outbreak. The country reported 47,000 new infections in the last 24 hours, the highest daily level since April. Health Minister Olivier Veran said during government questions in the National Assembly that by the end of this week daily cases could exceed the peak of the third wave of the virus eight months ago.Authorities have been on high alert as the omicron variant spreads. The Dutch national health service confirmed that the strain, first identified in South Africa, was in the Netherlands a earlier than first thought after detecting two cases in test samples taken a week ago. The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control has compiled reports of 44 cases of omicron in 11 European countries. So far, those cases have all been recorded with minor symptoms or they’re asymptomatic.The European Medicines Agency said it would use expedited procedures to approve new versions of Covid vaccines to address omicron if the current ones provide insufficient protection. That would mean regulatory approval could be completed in three to four months after companies move forward.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-moves-toward-mandatory-covid-19-shots-as-europe-clamps-down-101638289948723.html

Previously they had been able to take a lateral flow test and there was no requirement to isolate.The reintroduction of mandatory face masks brings England closer in line with the rest of the UK — Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland — which had not relaxed coronavirus restrictions as much as England had done since the summer.About 14 cases of the omicron variant have so far been identified across the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the new measures will “buy us time in the face” of the new variant.Johnson’s government announced Monday it is expanding its booster vaccine program, with a booster dose to be offered to all those over 18 years old three months after people had their second jab.Up until now, only people 40 years old or over and those deemed clinically vulnerable were eligible for the booster shot.The change in advice means around 13 million more people will be eligible for the vaccine. So far, the UK has given around 17.8 million booster shots.Johnson is expected to encourage more to take up the booster shots in a press conference later Tuesday.Jenny Harries, who heads the UK Health Security Agency, said that while there was still uncertainty in understanding the omicron variant, officials hope that the expansion of the booster shot rollout will “to some extent counter the potential drop in vaccine effectiveness we might find with this variant.”She also urged people to be cautious and reduce socializing over the festive season if possible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/face-masks-again-mandatory-in-england-amid-omicron-variant-spread-101638279648528.html
30-11-2021||World||Taliban executed, forcibly disappeared over 100 ex-security personnel: Report||NEW DELHI: The Taliban have summarily executed or forcibly disappeared more than 100 former police and intelligence officers in just four of Afghanistan’s 34 provinces since taking over the country on August 15, according to a report released by Human Rights Watch (HRW) on Tuesday. Rezaul H LaskarThe Taliban, through their intelligence operations and access to records left behind by the Ashraf Ghani government, have also identified new targets for arrest and execution despite proclaiming an amnesty, the report said.The Taliban leadership directed members of surrendering Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) units to register with them to receive a letter guaranteeing their safety. Individuals who registered were screened for ties to military, police, militia and special forces units or to commanders or former provincial authorities. The report said these screenings were used by the Taliban to detain and summarily execute or disappear individuals within days of registration.The 25-page report, “No forgiveness for people like you – Executions and enforced disappearances in Afghanistan under the Taliban,” provided evidence of the killing or disappearance of 47 former members of ANSF who surrendered or were apprehended by the Taliban between August 15 and October 31.HRW said it gathered credible information on more than 100 killings from Ghazni, Helmand, Kandahar and Kunduz – four of the 34 provinces of Afghanistan. The executions have generated fear among former officials and others who believed the Taliban takeover would lead to an end to “revenge attacks”.“The Taliban leadership’s promised amnesty has not stopped local commanders from summarily executing or disappearing former Afghan security force members,” said Patricia Gossman, associate Asia director at HRW. “The burden is on the Taliban to prevent further killings, hold those responsible to account, and compensate the victims’ families.”In just one example in the southern city of Kandahar in late September, Taliban forces went to the home of Baz Muhammad, who was employed by the National Directorate of Security (NDS), the former spy agency, and arrested him. Relatives later found his body.HRW said the Taliban carried out “abusive search operations, including night raids, to apprehend and, at times, forcibly disappear suspected former officials”.“Taliban night raids are terrifying,” an unnamed civil society activist from Helmand province told HRW. “They are conducted on the pretext of disarming ex-security forces who have not surrendered weapons. Those that ‘disappear’ are [victims] of night raids...The families can’t even ask where [the person has been taken].”During such searches, the Taliban threaten and abuse family members to make them reveal whereabouts of those in hiding. Some of those eventually apprehended were executed or taken into custody without acknowledgment that they are being held.In Nangarhar province, the Taliban targeted people they accuse of supporting the Islamic State of Khorasan Province (ISKP). As the UN has reported, Taliban operations against ISKP “rely heavily on extra-judicial detentions and killings”. Many of those killed were targeted because of Salafist views or tribal affiliations.HRW’s findings are largely in line with reports from journalists and former government officials in recent months. Several former officials, both from the security forces and civilian administration, have spoken of Taliban fighters visiting their homes and carrying out searches. In several instances confirmed by people familiar with the matter, the Taliban have threatened or coerced parents and relatives of the former officials to ascertain their whereabouts.On September 21, the Taliban announced the establishment of a commission to investigate reports of human rights abuses, corruption and other crimes. The commission has not announced any investigation into the reported killings, though it reported action against several Taliban members for stealing and corruption.In a response to HRW on November 21, the Taliban said it dismissed those responsible for abuses but provided no information to corroborate this claim.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-executed-forcibly-disappeared-over-100-ex-security-personnel-report-101638278553293.html

I am amazed by his survival skills," a coastguard official told AFP, declining to be identified.Dramatic footage released by the coastguard showed a team approaching him by boat calling out: "We are coming! Just a little bit longer!

Matsuno did not identify his nationality, citing privacy reasons.A genome analysis at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases confirmed Tuesday that he was infected with the new variant, which was first identified in South Africa.His travel companions and passengers in nearby seats have been identified and have been reported to Japanese health authorities for follow up. Japanese media said two of the patient’s relatives tested negative and have been quarantined in a government facility near Narita airport.Matsuno said the government will maintain strict border controls and will step up its capacity to conduct genome analyses of the new variant.Japan announced on Monday that it will ban all foreign visitors beginning Tuesday as an emergency precaution against the variant, tentatively through the end of the year. The government is also requiring Japanese nationals and foreigners with resident permits to quarantine 14 days following entry.The World Health Organization warned Monday that the global risk from the omicron variant is “very high” based on the early evidence, saying it could lead to surges with “severe consequences.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-confirms-first-case-of-omicron-variant-patient-hospitalised-govt-101638260927914.html

I just don't know how much because we need to wait for the data. But all the scientists I've talked to . . . are like 'this is not going to be good'," Bancel said.Moderna did not reply to a Reuters' request for comment on the interview and on when it expects to have data on the effectiveness of its vaccine against Omicron, which the World Health Organization (WHO) says carries a "very high" risk of infection surges.Bancel had earlier said on CNBC  that there should be more clarity on the efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines against Omicron in about two weeks, and that it could take months to begin shipping a vaccine that work against the new variant.The WHO and scientists have also said it could take days to several weeks to understand the level of severity of the variant and its potential to escape protection against immunity induced by vaccines."Vaccination will likely still keep you out of the hospital," said John Wherry, director of the Penn Institute for Immunology in Philadelphia.The uncertainty about the new variant has triggered global alarm, with border closures casting a shadow over a nascent economic recovery from a two-year pandemic.News of its emergence wiped roughly $2 trillion off the value of global stocks on Friday, but some calm was restored this week as investors waited for more data on Omicron.Remarks by President Joe Biden that the United States would not reinstate lockdowns had also helped soothe markets before comments from the Moderna CEO spooked investors.Biden has called for wider vaccination, while the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has urged everyone aged 18 years and older to get a booster shot. Britain too has expanded its Covid-19 booster programme amid Omicron fears.First reported on Nov. 24 from South Africa, Omicron has since spread to over a dozen countries. Japan, the world's third-largest economy, has confirmed its first case.HONG KONG EXPANDS CURBSCountries around the world have moved quickly to tighten border controls to prevent a recurrence of last year's strict lockdowns and steep economic downturns.Hong Kong has expanded a ban on entry for non-residents from several countries. It said non-residents from Angola, Ethiopia, Nigeria and Zambia would not be allowed to enter as of Nov. 30.Additionally, it said non-residents who have been to Austria, Australia, Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Israel and Italy in the past 21 days would not be allowed to enter the city from Dec. 2.The global financial hub, among the last places pursuing a zero-Covid strategy, has already banned non-residents arriving from South Africa, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia and Zimbabwe.In Australia, five travellers tested positive for Omicron.Singapore's health ministry said two travellers from Johannesburg who tested positive for the variant in Sydney had transited through its Changi airport.Australian authorities have also identified a sixth traveller who was most likely infected with the variant and had spent time in the community.Canberra delayed on Monday the reopening of the nation's borders for international students and skilled migrants, less than 36 hours before they were due to be allowed back in."We're doing this out of an abundance of caution but our overwhelming view is that whilst (Omicron) is an emerging variant, it is a manageable variant," Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt said.The global curbs on travellers from southern Africa also raised concerns about vaccine inequality."The people of Africa cannot be blamed for the immorally low level of vaccinations available in Africa – and they should not be penalized for identifying and sharing crucial science and health information with the world," UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement.India, home to the world's largest vaccine maker, has approved supplies of Covid-19 vaccines to many African countries and said it stands ready to "expeditiously" send more. China too has pledged 1 billion doses to the continent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccines-less-effective-against-omicron-variant-moderna-ceo-101638259402208.html

So far, of the vaccines used in India, only Covishield, the version of the Astra Zeneca vaccine manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII) had been approved for travel purposes.Health Canada said on Monday that the country will “expand its list of accepted vaccines for the purposes of entry into Canada and exemption from some testing and quarantine requirements. The list will include Sinopharm, Sinovac and COVAXIN, matching the World Health Organization (WHO) Emergency Use Listing (EUL).”Even as this measure comes into effect, India and Canada continue discussions over reciprocal recognition of vaccine certificates. Indian officials have also expressed their continued concern over the “bottleneck” created by restrictive testing measures imposed by Canada, where only a negative RT-PCR result from a test conducted at a single laboratory at Delhi airport within 18 hours of boarding the flight is accepted for travel to the country.Those considered fully vaccinated will also be able to avail of other exemptions including not being subject to testing on arrival, a mandatory 14-day quarantine period including another Covid-19 test on the eighth day.To be considered fully vaccinates, the individual must have had their second dose of the vaccine series at least 14 days prior to entry into Canada.These relaxed measures go into place even as countries including Canada reassess their travel regimen due to concerns over the Omicron variant of the coronavirus. Canada has already imposed a ban on foreign national from seven southern African nations from entering the country, with exemptions for Canadian citizens and permanent residents.As for Covaxin, provinces like Ontario, Canada’s most populous, are also issuing the standardised vaccine certificate, if those who have received two doses of the jab take a third dose of an mRNA vaccine in Canada.Health Canada is also examining an emergency use authorization for Covaxin, though a decision in that regard isn’t imminent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-begins-entry-for-travellers-vaccinated-with-covaxin-101638257852094.html

But Agrawal has shut those targeting him, including some Republicans in the United States.Also Read | Who is Parag Agrawal, the new CEO of Twitter?The tweet at the centre of the controversy was posted by Agrawal in 2010, when he was not even an employee of Twitter. It quoted a comedian mocking racism and Islamophobia in America.“If they are not gonna make a distinction between Muslims and extremists, then why should I distinguish between white people and racists,” Agrawal said in the tweet posted on October 26, 2010."If they are not gonna make a distinction between muslims and extremists, then why should I distinguish between white people and racists."Picking up on this, Ken Buck, a Republican who represents Colorado’s fourth Congressional district, questioned how users can trust the new CEO of Twitter to treat everyone equally given his views.Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee chipped in: “This is Parag Agrawal, Twitter’s new CEO and the person who’s going to be deciding what kind of speech is allowed on Twitter.”Agrawal had, however, clarified to a user shortly after posting the tweet that he was quoting comedian Aasif Mandvi from The Daily Show.@Joylita I was quoting Asif Mandvi from The Daily Show. The article you are reading seems too deep for my current mental state.“I am amused by people that pass judgement on people for passing judgement. I was attempting to do the same to amuse myself,” he had said in a subsequent tweet.The latest row started after a right-wing website Breitbart picked up the tweet on Monday and inferred that Agrawal supported racism. It also reproduced an old interview given by the new Twitter CEO to MIT Technology Review, and claimed that free speech was not the focus of the company.However, other users have defended Agrawal, including Andrew Kaczynski, a reporter with CNN. He posted the original clip of Mandvi’s interview which shows the comedian indeed made those remarks.This tweet which is currently going viral among the right from Twitter's new CEO is him quoting a Daily Show segment that aired that night about stereotypes.It's a joke about absurd stereotypes, not a factual statement. https://t.co/hhIdXTSiOHhttps://t.co/9bFtGrfExWThe 37-year-old was named the CEO of Twitter by Jack Dorsey, who stepped down after 16 years at the company that he co-founded and helmed.

We have a lot of tools at our disposal and we will act and react according to when the data and the science come in and we will make our appropriate moves according to that,” the top US immunologist said referring to Biden’s address to his country.Biden urged Americans to not panic about the variant and reiterated that full vaccination and boosters were the “best protection” against the disease. He especially insisted on the booster doses.Also read | US company says its Covid test accurately detects omicron variant. Here’s how“Most Americans are fully vaccinated but not yet boosted. If you are 18 years or over and got fully vaccinated before June the 1st, go get the booster shot today. A fully vaccinated boosted person is the most protected against Covid.”Stressing this point, Fauci also said that boosters bolstered the protection offered by the vaccines against “any variant” of the disease. “The president encouraged people to get vaccinated and those who are vaccinated to get their booster shot because that will bring up the level of protection against any variant, the way we have seen, just the way it did with Delta,” he added.Biden also assured that the US government would accelerate the development and deployment of updated vaccines or boosters for the omicron variant, in the event it is needed. He also urged the people to continue wearing masks when indoors or in public settings.“I want to reiterate: Dr Fauci believes that the current vaccines provide at least some protection against the new variant and the boosters strengthen that protection significantly,” he said during his address.Also, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC), the country’s public health agency, has now recommended a booster for all adults (people above 18 years of age). Earlier, it approved boosters for all adults but recommended it only for those above 50 years of age, but has now expanded its advisory in view of the new variant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-us-immunologist-anthony-fauci-echoes-joe-biden-on-boosters-panic-around-omicron-variant-101638243176644.html

30-11-2021||World||Singapore says 2 travellers to Sydney with Omicron transited at Changi airport||Singapore's health ministry said two travellers from Johannesburg who tested positive for the Omicron coronavirus variant in Sydney, had transited through Changi airport.The two individuals left Johannesburg on Nov. 27 on a Singapore Airlines flight and arrived at Changi on the same day for their transit flight, the ministry said in a statement. Both had tested negative for Covid-19 prior to departure, it added.The ministry said most of the travellers had remained in the transit area at Changi Airport. Of the seven who disembarked, six had been placed on a 10-day stay at home notice, while the seventh, a close contact of an infected individual on the flight, had been quarantined."Contact tracing is ongoing for airport staff who may have come into transient contact with the cases," the ministry said.Australian authorities said on Sunday that the two passengers who tested positive on arrival in Sydney were fully vaccinated and had been placed in isolation.Omicron has prompted countries across the globe including the United States to limit travel from southern Africa, where the virus was first detected. The World Health Organization said it carries a very high risk of infection surges, but said no deaths have yet been linked to the new variant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-says-2-travellers-to-sydney-with-omicron-transited-at-changi-airport-101638239804637.html
30-11-2021||World||US company says its Covid test accurately detects omicron variant. Here’s how||A US company has said its Covid-19 diagnostic tests can accurately detect omicron, the new coronavirus variant, that has prompted several countries to impose travel bans and shut their borders.Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc said in a statement on Monday its TaqPath Covid-19 assays can report accurate results even in the case where one of the gene targets is impacted by a mutation."This assay can be used not only to successfully detect Covid-19 but… it can also be used as a proxy for the variant," Mark Stevenson, chief operating officer at Thermo Fisher Scientific, said in an interview, according to Reuters.This is the only Covid-19 test that is both authorised by the US Food and Drug Administration and can be used to indicate if a case is caused by the omicron variant, Stevenson said.Also read | From Pfizer to Moderna: What vaccine makers are saying about omicron jabsStevenson said test samples must still be sent to a lab for sequencing to confirm that the case was caused by omicron and not another variant with similar features, such as alpha.He added that Thermo is prepared to increase its production of tests to meet demand from countries in Africa and elsewhere as they work to track the spread of the new variant.Also read | No fatalities linked to new variant but WHO cautiousOnly Thermo Fisher has so far confirmed that its test can be used to help identify the omicron variant. Other Covid-19 tests, including from Roche Holding AG and Abbott Laboratories, can also be used to diagnose positive cases caused by the variant.The World Health Organization (WHO) classified the omicron variant, which was first detected in southern Africa, as a SARS-CoV-2 "variant of concern" last week and said it may spread more quickly than other forms.Omicron has now been confirmed in Australia, Belgium, Botswana, Britain, Denmark, Germany, Hong Kong, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, France, South Africa and Canada.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-company-says-its-covid-test-accurately-detects-omicron-variant-here-s-how-101638234998877.html
30-11-2021||World||From Pfizer to Moderna: What vaccine makers are saying about omicron jabs||Omicron poses a "very high" risk globally, the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned even as the new variant of the coronavirus has raised concerns around the world, with countries implementing travel bans and researchers racing to study whether it will evade vaccines. As omicron cases are being reported throughout the world, vaccine makers have said they are working on jabs that could tackle the new strain.PfizerThe US drugmaker's CEO Albert Bourla has said Pfizer has already started working on a version of its Covid-19 vaccine specifically targeting the new Omicron variant in case the current inoculation is not effective against the latest strain.Bourla told CNBC that his company on Friday began testing the current vaccine against the Omicron variant, which was first reported in South Africa and has reignited fears of a global wave of Covid-19 infections.Also read | US CDC says all adults should get Covid-19 booster shots"I don't think the result will be the vaccines don't protect," Bourla said. But the testing could show that existing shots "protect less," which would mean "that we need to create a new vaccine," Bourla said.Bourla said he was also "very confident" that Pfizer's recently unveiled antiviral pill would work as a treatment for infections caused by the mutations, including Omicron.ModernaModerna Inc, another leading Covid-19 vaccine maker, has said it was developing a booster shot against the new variant.Also read | No fatalities linked to new variant but WHO cautiousModerna chief medical officer Paul Burton said on Sunday on the BBC’s “Andrew Marr Show” that vaccinated people should still be protected, depending on how long ago they got their shots, and for now the best advice is to take one of the current Covid vaccines.Johnson & JohnsonJohnson & Johnson also said Monday that it is "pursuing an Omicron-specific variant vaccine and will progress it as needed."AstraZenecaThe Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical company has said it is examining the impact of omicron on its vaccine and its antibody cocktail and that it was hopeful its combination drug would retain efficacy."As with any new emerging variants, we are looking into B.1.1.529 to understand more about it and the impact on the vaccine," AstraZeneca said in a statement.Also read | Covid clusters in Maharashtra, Karnataka under watch for new variantAstraZeneca said that it had developed a vaccine platform to respond quickly to new variants with Oxford University, where the vaccine was created."We are also testing our long-acting antibody combination AZD7442 against this new variant and are hopeful AZD7442 will retain efficacy since it comprises two potent antibodies with different and complementary activities against the virus," it said.Sputnik VThe Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which backs Covid-19 vaccine Sputnik V's development by the state-run Gamaleya Center, the jab is effective against omicron but they were also developing an adapted booster.RDIF said that the centre "has already begun developing the new version of Sputnik vaccine adapted to Omicron."

30-11-2021||World||US CDC says all adults should get Covid-19 booster shots||The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Monday everyone aged 18 years and older should get a booster shot, as it looks to tackle a new and highly infectious strain of the coronavirus that is quickly spreading across the globe.The update comes after President Joe Biden on Monday called for wider vaccination to curb the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant, which was first detected in southern Africa.The U.S. health regulators last week expanded the eligibility for booster shots of COVID-19 vaccines to all adults aged 18 and older either six months after their initial Pfizer or Moderna vaccine doses or two months after their Johnson & Johnson shot.The CDC had, however, stopped short of saying all adults aged 18 to 49 should get the additional shots.The agency is taking a more cautious stance as Omicron's emergence further emphasizes the importance of vaccination and boosters, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said in a statement on Monday.Amid the renewed emphasis, Pfizer and partner BioNTech are expected to ask the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in the coming days to authorize their booster shots for those aged 16 and 17 years, the Washington Post reported on Monday, citing sources.Pfizer and BioNTech did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.Omicron, which the World Health Organization said carried a very high risk for fueling infection surges, has now been confirmed in several countries including Germany, Hong Kong, South Africa and Canada.Scientists in the United States and around the world are urgently examining vaccine effectiveness related to this variant, the CDC said.The agency also said the 47 million adults who are not yet vaccinated are encouraged to get vaccinated as soon as possible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-cdc-says-all-adults-should-get-covid-19-booster-shots-101638230791928.html
30-11-2021||World||‘China started work on border villages long before LAC standoff began’||A year before China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) attempted to unilaterally alter the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh sector, Chinese authorities were putting in place measures to use border villages to buttress their territorial claims and keep an eye on the Indian side.This trend was picked up by a group of Tibetan researchers who worked for the past two years on putting together a handbook aimed at helping the world to decipher China’s policies that are often vaguely worded and open to different interpretations.As they put together material for the handbook titled “Decoding Chinese Communist Party”, to be released on December 2, the researchers came across several reports on the Chinese side’s focus on using border villages as a means to project force along the frontier.One such report in Tibetan from August 2019, circulated on Chinese instant messaging apps and websites, was on border patrols and propaganda activities at Geru village in Shigatse prefecture, bordering India’s Sikkim state.The report quoted Phurbu Sonam, deployed as the first party secretary in Geru, which is described as a “border defence village”, as saying, “These days, Geru residents have a strong consciousness that everyone is a spy and every household is a spy house.”“The bond between the soldiers and the local residents is as deep as the fish and water,” Sonam added. Every Monday, permanent Chinese cadres stationed in Geru organised a ceremony at the border pillar to hoist the Chinese flag and sing the national anthem. To assist border defences forces, about 100 people from the village conducted regular border patrols on motorcycles.Tsering Tsomo, executive director of the Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy, which put together the handbook, said the five researchers who worked on the project picked up more such reports that pointed to China’s intentions along the LAC.The Chinese side is not only attempting to recruit Tibetans but also trying to ensure the loyalty of their communities. “This requires social engineering on a large scale, giving border communities top priority for employment and finance for enterprises, and creating villages intended to create abiding dependence and loyalty,” she said.“This handbook is a tool to help people assess the intentions of the Chinese side. Many countries haven’t devoted adequate resources to understanding China. The handbook unpacks the meanings and connotations of Chinese slogans and popular phrases. For example, ‘Xi Jinping Thought’ is several volumes long and open to interpretation,” Tsomo added.For instance, the Tibetan researchers contend that India is the clear concern of China’s new land border law enacted in October. The law, which takes effect in January, will consolidate the securitisation of China’s land borders, the researchers said.While China has land borders with 14 countries, it has unsettled boundaries only with India and Bhutan. The standoff in Ladakh that began in May 2020 has taken bilateral ties to an all-time low and India and China have been unable to disengage frontline troops despite several rounds of talks.The law has strong punitive clauses forbidding activities such as flying drones near the border, mandating military exclusion zones and authorising security agencies to open fire at anyone believed to have committed a crime. Article 53 of the law, the researchers contend, is aimed at authorising a Chinese security presence in countries in the neighbourhood.Article 11, they said, is aimed at pushing Tibetan nomads into villages in border districts and making key border prefectures, such as Shigatse and Lhoka, into zones where loyalty to China is required.Other articles establish a very different kind of long-term securitisation, which requires inhabitants of border prefectures to undertake profound culture change. This is aimed at pushing local communities such as Tibetans to drop their own identity and identify first and foremost as Chinese, the researchers believe.Tsomo said Chinese ethnic policy has “abandoned the fiction that China comprises 56 nationalities, many with territories within which regional ethnic autonomy is legally guaranteed”, and this has been replaced with efforts aimed at cultural assimilation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-started-work-on-border-villages-long-before-lac-standoff-began-researchers-101638203129489.html
30-11-2021||World||Merriam-Webster chooses vaccine as word of the year for 2021||With an expanded definition to reflect the times, Merriam-Webster has declared an omnipresent truth as its 2021 word of the year: vaccine.“This was a word that was extremely high in our data every single day in 2021,” Peter Sokolowski, Merriam-Webster's editor-at-large, told The Associated Press ahead of Monday's announcement.“It really represents two different stories. One is the science story, which is this remarkable speed with which the vaccines were developed. But there's also the debates regarding policy, politics and political affiliation. It's one word that carries these two huge stories,” he said.The selection follows “vax” as word of the year from the folks who publish the Oxford English Dictionary. And it comes after Merriam-Webster chose “pandemic” as tops in lookups last year on its online site.Also Read | Pandemic: Merriam-Webster’s word of the year not a shocker“The pandemic was the gun going off and now we have the aftereffects,” Sokolowski said.At Merriam-Webster, lookups for “vaccine” increased 601 per cent over 2020, when the first US shot was administered in New York in December after quick development, and months of speculation and discussion over efficacy. The world's first jab occurred earlier that month in the UK.Compared to 2019, when there was little urgency or chatter about vaccines, Merriam-Webster logged an increase of 1,048 per cent in lookups this year. Debates over inequitable distribution, vaccine mandates and boosters kept interest high, Sokolowski said. So did vaccine hesitancy and friction over vaccine passports.The word “vaccine” wasn't birthed in a day, or due to a single pandemic. The first known use stretches back to 1882 but references pop up earlier related to fluid from cowpox pustules used in inoculations, Sokolowski said.It was borrowed from the New Latin “vaccina,” which goes back to Latin's feminine “vaccinus,” meaning “of or from a cow.” The Latin for cow is “vacca,” a word that might be akin to the Sanskrit “vasa," according to Merriam-Webster.Inoculation, on the other hand, dates to 1714, in one sense referring to the act of injecting an “inoculum.”Earlier this year, Merriam-Webster added to its online entry for “vaccine” to cover all the talk of mRNA vaccines, or messenger vaccines such as those for Covid-19 developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.While other dictionary companies choose words of the year by committee, Merriam-Webster bases its selection on lookup data, paying close attention to spikes and, more recently, year-over-year increases in searches after weeding out evergreens. The company has been declaring a word of the year since 2008. Among its runners-up in the word biography of 2021:INSURRECTION: Interest was driven by the deadly Jan. 6 siege on the U.S. Capitol. Arrests continue, as do congressional hearings over the attack by supporters of President Donald Trump. Some of Trump's allies have resisted subpoenas, including Steve Bannon.Searches for the word increased by 61,000% over 2020, Sokolowksi said.INFRASTRUCTURE: President Joe Biden was able to deliver what Trump often spoke of but never achieved: A bipartisan infrastructure bill signed into law. When Biden proposed help with broadband access, eldercare and preschool, conversation changed from not only roads and bridges but “figurative infrastructure,” Sokolowski said.“Many people asked, what is infrastructure if it's not made out of steel or concrete? Infrastructure, in Latin, means underneath the structure,” he said.PERSEVERANCE: It's the name of NASA's latest Mars rover. It landed Feb. 18, 2021. “Perseverance is the most sophisticated rover NASA has ever sent to the Red Planet, with a name that embodies NASA's passion, and our nation's capability, to take on and overcome challenges,” the space agency said.The name was thought up by Alexander Mather, a 14-year-old seventh-grader at Lake Braddock Secondary School in Burke, Virginia. He participated in an essay contest organized by NASA. He was one of 28,000 K-12 students to submit entries.NOMAD: The word had its moment with the 2020 release of the film “Nomadland.” It went on to win three Oscars in April 2021, including best picture, director (Chloé Zhao) and actress (Frances McDormand). Zhao became the first woman of color to win best director.The AP's film writer Jake Coyle called the indie success “a plain-spoken meditation on solitude, grief and grit. He wrote that it “struck a chord in a pandemic-ravaged year. It made for an unlikely Oscar champ: A film about people who gravitate to the margins took center stage."Other words in Merriam-Webster's Top 10: Cicada (we had an invasion), guardian (the Cleveland Indians became the Cleveland Guardians), meta (the lofty new name of Facebook's parent company), cisgender (a gender identity that corresponds to one's sex assigned at birth), woke (charged with politics and political correctness) and murraya (a tropical tree and the word that won the 2021 Scripps National Spelling Bee for 14-year-old Zaila Avant-garde).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/merriamwebsters-chooses-vaccine-as-word-of-the-year-for-2021-101638169808957.html
