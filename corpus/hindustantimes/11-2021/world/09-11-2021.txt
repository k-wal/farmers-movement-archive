Yago Riedijk, the 29-year-old convicted terrorist from the Netherlands, said he “can’t really comment” when pushed to condemn the Islamic States’ brutal methods of punishment, reported Daily Mail.Riedijk is currently lodged in Kurdish-run al-Roj prison in northern Syria.According to the report, the ISIS terrorist is still hopeful of the group’s revival and establishment of a caliphate that adheres to “Islamic traditions”. While Riedijk said he didn’t agree with the terror attacks in Europe, he had no comments to offer about attacks on other Muslims and Yazidis.“Personally, I don't agree with these attacks for a couple of reasons. The prohibition of killing innocent people in Islam, women and children,” Daily Mail quoted the ISIS terrorist as saying.“I see these attacks as not being Islamicly responsible [sic]” he added.

The Afghans, for their part, did not get it done either. It is simply very regrettable," she further said.Talking about the evacuation process in the country, Merkel said that Germany not only evacuated a large amount of staff from Afghanistan but also helped many Afghans who did not work with Germany but were active advocates of freedom and democracy in the war-torn Asian country, according to TOLOnews.Meanwhile, the Human Rights Watch feared that there would be an increase in child marriage across the country due to the lack of education and rising poverty, reported TOLOnews."Access to education is another issue. As you know, the vast majority of girls' secondary schools are still closed, and even primary schools that are open seem very low attended by girls and by boys as well--so a huge proportion of the children in Afghanistan are being denied the right to education at the moment. And this leads to another problem which is child marriage. We know that the combination of poverty and lack of access to education is driving up child marriage and we have also seen the incredibly disturbing reports about families selling their children--almost always girls--to pay for food," TOLOnews quoted Heather Barr at Human Rights Watch as saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/situation-in-afghanistan-very-regrettable-says-german-chancellor-merkel-101636457068631.html

There's a chance she will be reformed, and I couldn't help but to hesitate over choosing a death sentence," the judge said.Court officials were unavailable for comment on Tuesday afternoon.Japan, where more than 100 inmates await execution, is one of the few developed nations that still have the death penalty.Prosecutors had demanded a death sentence for Kuboki but the nurse's lawyers reportedly argued that she suffered depression due to stress over the deaths of her patients, and had diminished capacity.Kuboki had told the court she did not want to be blamed by family members when something wrong happened to her patients when she was on her shift, and felt "relieved" when one of the victims died, NHK said.The son of one of the victims said he was not happy with the ruling, according to the broadcaster."She killed innocent people with selfish motives and she's not sentenced to death. It's wrong," he said.Public support for capital punishment in Japan remains high despite international criticism, including from rights groups.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nurse-who-murdered-patients-gets-life-sentence-in-japan-101636453908148.html

Meanwhile, after announcing the government in Afghanistan, the Taliban regime has failed to get recognition. Aside from China, Pakistan and a handful of other countries, the rest of the world is taking a wait and watch policy while keeping an eye on the conduct of the outfit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/irans-special-envoy-to-afghanistan-to-visit-kabul-soon-report-101636448811269.html

It is the first time those with covert infections outnumbered those with symptoms during the broadest outbreak that China has experienced since the virus first emerged in Wuhan in late 2019. Of the 31 provinces on the Chinese mainland, 20 have reported infections caused by the delta variant, including the capital Beijing.China remains the only country in the world bent on weeding out every infection within its borders, defying a global trend of learning to live with Covid after more infectious variants rendered restrictions less effective and made eliminating it markedly more difficult. Mass vaccination and the rollout of booster shots have significantly reduced the burden of the disease, with the majority of fully vaccinated people developing mild or no symptoms if they contract a breakthrough infection.“It’s different now than a year ago because the consequences of infection, particularly if you’re vaccinated, are less marked than they were a year ago,” said Peter Collignon, an infectious disease physician and professor at the Australian National University Medical School in Canberra.While China has seen severe disease among elderly patients with underlying medical conditions, the country hasn’t reported a single death related to Covid for nearly 10 months. With more than 75% of the population fully vaccinated, most patients experience only mild symptoms. The country has reported at least a dozen asymptomatic infections every day for the past week. Many of the stealthy infections were found only after authorities were alerted to the potential for community transmission following a case that emerged during routine testing of workers and residents. In some extreme cases, close contacts tested positive after they emerged from prolonged quarantine periods.“The reality is that it’s more difficult to control now,” Collignon said. “But equally, the consequences -- providing you get high levels of vaccination -- are much, much less than they were a year ago.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-covid-zero-turns-more-elusive-as-symptom-free-cases-grow-101636441777841.html

The bizarre incident came to light last month, leading to an apology from Osaka University researcher and hospital's vice president Kazuhiko Nakatani.According to Japanese news outlet, the hospital is situated in Osaka University. The clinic building is attached to the faculty of medicine.Shockingly, the well water was flowing to 120 faucets, which were used for drinking water, washing hands and even gargling. The fault happened because of an error in connecting pipes when the hospital was constructed in 1993.The report in Japanese media outlet said that no one flagged or even noticed the issue until the hospital management started construction of a new treatment plant. The problem of unsafe water was discovered during an inspection of the new building.The university is investigating the matter; it said that though the water quality is being checked, no health hazard has been confirmed.The records are available since 2014 about the water being inspected for colour, taste and odour every week. There has been, however, no issues since then.Nakatani issued an apology at a press conference recently for causing anxiety. "I am very sorry that the university hospital that provides advanced medical care has caused anxiety," he was quoted as saying by the publication.Yomiuri Shimbun reported that there are more than 100 other buildings in the campus that use the simply treated well water. The hospital authorities said they will check the piping and get the error rectified, according to the publication.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-hospital-used-water-meant-for-toilet-as-drinking-water-for-30-yrs-report-101636441719888.html

The latest violence took place on Nov 2, when gunmen stormed a military hospital in the capital, killing about 20 people including a senior Taliban commander. No claimed responsibility for the attack but the Taliban has blamed the rival group.Targeted killings of former government officials, including police and prosecutors, have also been reported. Four civil society activists and four members of the earlier Afghan police force were recently found dead in northern Mazar-e-Sharif city. Locals blamed the Taliban for their deaths.Soon after the Taliban swept into power, there were reports many armed members of the group went door-to-door to find and kill opponents or those who worked with the previous government or US forces over the past two decades. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahed would not comment on those reports but had vowed the militant group would investigate them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-carries-out-background-checks-within-ranks-to-identify-is-infiltrators-101636437097623.html

The complex has been constructed in Taklamakan desert in Southwest Xinjiang province, the news outlet further reported based on the photos provided by satellite imagery company Maxar.Two Arleigh Burke-class destroyers are also part of the target range, according to USNI News. It is near a former target range China used to test early versions of its DF-21D (called carrier killer) and DF 26-R (also called Guam killer) ballistic missiles.It added that the new facility shows signs of a sophisticated instrumented target range.However, the targets do not have intricate details of the carrier, such as lifts and weapons sensors. The replicas of aircraft carriers also do not have the metaling, but the outline which appears in Maxar's images clearly depict the target as a naval ship.One of the recent images, taken by Maxar on October 9, shows a 75-metre-long target with extensive instrumentation.The facility also has an extensive rail system, according to USNI News.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at a daily briefing on Monday that he had no information about the images, saying, "I'm not aware of the situation you mentioned."Asked about the mock-ups, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said that the US continues to be concerned by China's "increasingly coercive behaviour" in the Indo-Pacific region.China-US ties have been quietly improving in recent months, but the two nations are sparring over Taiwan and alarm has been growing in Washington over Beijing’s nuclear arsenal. In a sign of how heated the rhetoric over Taiwan has become, Chinese state media last week had to tame online speculation over a possible war.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-bares-its-teeth-in-us-ship-targets-on-taiwan-101636434876261.html
09-11-2021||World||Canada may appoint Cameron Mackay as envoy to India||In an effort to boost relations with India through stronger economic ties, the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is looking at appointing a veteran trade expert Cameron Mackay as its high commissioner to New Delhi.He is currently Canada’s Ambassador to Indonesia, but has an established track record in trade negotiations.Mackay served as the director general of Global Affairs Canada’s Trade Negotiations Bureau, where he coordinated and supported Canada’s bilateral, regional and multilateral trade negotiations.While discussions on a free trade agreement between the two nations have been revived, Hindustan Times has learnt that Ottawa is almost certain to appoint to trade negotiator to be the country’s top diplomat in India after the post fell vacant when Nadir Patel returned to Canada in June this year after serving for over six years as high commissioner there.However, the decision on naming the new high commissioner will lie with Canada’s new foreign minister Melanie Joly, after she replaced her predecessor Marc Garneau when Justin Trudeau announced his new cabinet late last month.India and Canada took forward discussions over a trade deal to the ministerial level at the G20 Trade and Investment Ministerial Meeting in Sorrento, Italy in October, when Indian commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal met Canada’s international trade minister Mary Ng.Piyush Goyal had then tweeted that talks were on “for a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA), with energy, new technologies, manufactured goods & services, being key areas for future cooperation”.After languishing for nearly four years, Indian and Canadian negotiators resumed discussions in June towards a possible trade pact between the two countries.Those discussions, held virtually, were undertaken by officials of India’s commerce ministry and those from Canada’s international trade department. They had revisited the stalled CEPA, which has been under consideration for a full decade after talks were initiated under then Indian PM Dr Manmohan Singh and then Canadian PM Stephen Harper.The last round of negotiations was held in August 2017. While Canadian officials wanted to clinch a Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement (FIPA) prior to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s visit to India in February 2018, New Delhi was more interested in concluding CEPA first. However, with relations declining following that disastrous visit, fresh talks were not scheduled outside of routine stocktaking.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-may-appoint-cameron-mackay-as-envoy-to-india-101636434965072.html
09-11-2021||World||Eye on India: China builds, delivers biggest stealth warship to Pakistan||China on Monday delivered to Pakistan the largest and most advanced warship, a frigate with stealth capabilities, it has ever manufactured as Beijing and Islamabad continue to strengthen their military capabilities against regional rival, India.Chinese state media reported the commissioning of the warship, quoting local and Pakistani officials, listing the vessel’s advanced capabilities, and noting that the delivery highlights Sino-Pakistan “all-weather strategic cooperative partnership”.The PNS Tughril is the first of the four Type 054 frigates being constructed for the Pakistan Navy, the state-run tabloid, Global Times reported, saying that the “…ship is a technologically advanced and highly capable platform with enormous surface-to-surface, surface-to-air and underwater firepower, besides extensive surveillance potentials”.Designed and built by China State Shipbuilding Corporation Limited (CSSC), the frigate was delivered to the Pakistan Navy in a commissioning ceremony in Shanghai, the tabloid reported, quoting a CSSC statement, issued on Monday.Compared to previous Chinese frigates, the new ship has better air defence capability, as it is equipped with an improved radar system and a larger amount of missiles with a longer range, Zhang Junshe, a senior research fellow at the PLA Naval Research Academy, told the Global Times in a previous interview.Zhang said Type 054A, on which the Type 054A/P is based, is China’s most advanced frigate, adding it also has world-class stealth capability.“The completion and the delivery of the vessel is another major achievement of China-Pakistan friendship, and will further enhance the all-weather strategic cooperative partnership between the two countries,” the CSSC said.Speaking to Chinese state media earlier this year, Pakistan navy chief Admiral M Amjad Khan Niazi, had listed the warship procurement from China.“…naval collaboration between the two countries has been strengthened with the procurement of F-22P frigates, fast attack craft (missile), helicopters and state-of-the-art survey ship. The Pakistan Navy has also contracted construction of eight Hangor-class submarines, four Type 054A/P ships (one of which was delivered on Monday) and medium-altitude long-endurance unmanned combat aerial vehicles from China,” Niazi had said.“The delivery of the frigate also serves as a milestone in expanding the influence of Chinese vessels as products and boosting their competitiveness in the international market,” CSSC said.China and Pakistan have also upgraded their jointly developed JF-17 fighter jet, it emerged last year. “The development and production of the JF-17 Block 3 are under way,” Yang Wei, a Chinese legislator and chief designer of the China-Pakistan co-developed fighter jet, was quoted as saying by the state media in 2020.The JF-17, or the FC-1, is a single-engine multi-role light fighter jet jointly developed by China and Pakistan for export, according to the website of the Aviation Industry Corporation of China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eye-on-india-china-builds-delivers-biggest-stealth-warship-to-pakistan-101636432684895.html
09-11-2021||World||SpaceX capsule with 4 ISS astronauts returns to earth, ending 200-day flight||Four astronauts returned to Earth on Monday, riding home with SpaceX to end a 200-day space station mission that began last spring.Their capsule parachuted into the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Pensacola, Florida, in darkness. Recovery boats quickly moved in with spotlights.Their homecoming — coming just eight hours after leaving the International Space Station — paved the way for SpaceX's launch of their four replacements as early as Wednesday night.The newcomers were scheduled to launch first, but NASA switched the order because of bad weather and an astronaut's undisclosed medical condition. The welcoming duties will now fall to the lone American and two Russians left behind at the space station.Before Monday afternoon’s undocking, German astronaut Matthias Maurer, who’s waiting to launch at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center, tweeted it was a shame the two crews wouldn’t overlap at the space station but “we trust you’ll leave everything nice and tidy.” His will be SpaceX's fourth crew flight for NASA in just 1 1/2 years.NASA astronauts Shane Kimbrough and Megan McArthur, Japan's Akihiko Hoshide and France's Thomas Pesquet should have been back Monday morning, but high wind in the recovery zone delayed their return.“One more night with this magical view. Who could complain? I’ll miss our spaceship!” Pesquet tweeted alongside a brief video showing the space station illuminated against the blackness of space and the twinkling city lights on the nighttime side of Earth.From the space station, NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei -- midway through a one-year flight -- bid farewell to each of his departing friends, telling McArthur "I’ll miss hearing your laughter in adjacent modules.”Before leaving the neighborhood, the four took a spin around the space station, taking pictures. This was a first for SpaceX; NASA's shuttles used to do it all the time before their retirement a decade ago. The last Russian capsule fly-around was three years ago.It wasn't the most comfortable ride back. The toilet in their capsule was broken, and so the astronauts needed to rely on diapers for the eight-hour trip home. They shrugged it off late last week as just one more challenge in their mission.The first issue arose shortly after their April liftoff; Mission Control warned a piece of space junk was threatening to collide with their capsule. It turned out to be a false alarm. Then in July, thrusters on a newly arrived Russian lab inadvertently fired and sent the station into a spin. The four astronauts took shelter in their docked SpaceX capsule, ready to make a hasty departure if necessary.Among the upbeat milestones: four spacewalks to enhance the station's solar power, a movie-making visit by a Russian film crew and the first-ever space harvest of chile peppers.The next crew will also spend six months up there, welcoming back-to-back groups of tourists. A Japanese tycoon and his personal assistant will get a lift from the Russian Space Agency in December, followed by three businessmen arriving via SpaceX in February. SpaceX's first privately chartered flight, in September, bypassed the space station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spacex-capsule-with-4-iss-astronauts-returns-to-earth-ending-200-day-flight-101636429511665.html

Some, however, have continued to experience symptoms weeks or even months later.The figures are based on daily reports provided by health authorities in each country.A significant proportion of the less severe or asymptomatic cases remain undetected despite increased screening in many countries since the start of the pandemic. In addition, testing policies differ from country to country.Europe is the region with the highest number of infections, registering more than 76 million Covid-19 cases since the start of the outbreak in China in December 2019.Asia is the second most affected with 56,201,653 cases, followed by the United States and Canada (48,290,522 infections) and Latin America and the Caribbean (46,107,131).The number of new cases around the world has been slowly increasing over the past few weeks.Nearly 449,000 new daily infections have been recorded on average over the past seven days, against just over 400,000 in mid-October.Of the new infections recorded worldwide, more than 60 percent are in Europe, which has seen an average of 279,000 cases a day over the past seven days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-covid-19-tally-crosses-250-million-report-101636426537803.html

But traffic advanced steadily.In the Mexican city of Ciudad Juarez opposite El Paso, Texas, about 20 people lined up early on Monday before crossing and embracing family on the other side of the border."We thought they were going to tell us again they had decided not to open it," said Lorena Hernandez, stroking her grown-up daughter's hair and smiling broadly after they were reunited in El Paso for the first time since March 2020. "I said, 'If they don't reopen, I'm going to take a plane.'"Mexico's foreign ministry said late on Monday that the first day of the border reopening was carried out "without incident.""The border flow is expected to increase over the weekend and progressively as the holidays approach and starting with Black Friday," the ministry said.Still, differing rules over coronavirus vaccines threaten to hold up some family reunions, while the prospect of some curbs easing has also encouraged migrants to try their luck seeking US asylum, posing a new test for the Biden administration.Some inoculated Mexicans will be prevented from entering the United States immediately if they received vaccines in Mexico that have not been approved by the World Health Organization, such as China's CanSino and Russia's Sputnik V."I never imagined that because I got the CanSino vaccine I wouldn't be able to cross," lamented Donato Suarez, a driver at a private university in Tijuana who had hoped to visit relatives in the United States he has not seen for nearly two years."We even had plans to do something when the border reopened," he added, noting around 300 people where he works are in the same predicament. "We'll have to wait."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/usmexico-border-reopens-after-20-months-of-covid-shutdown-101636421626546.html

Wang and her colleague Zhai Zhigang stepped out of the module on Sunday night - waving to the camera while tethered to the outside of the station - and installed a suspension device and transfer connectors.The third member of the crew, Ye Guangfu, assisted from inside the station, China Manned Space (CMS) agency said.“This marks the first extravehicular activity of the Shenzhou-13 crew, and it is also the first in China’s space history involving the participation of a woman astronaut,” said CMS.“The whole process was smooth and successful,” the agency added.Tiangong is expected to operate for at least 10 years, and the three astronauts are the second group to stay there. Wang is the first woman to visit.Sunday’s operation came just weeks after Wang, Zhai and third team member Ye Guangfu blasted off from the Jiuquan launch centre in northwestern China’s Gobi desert. The team is expected to spend six months at the station.Soviet cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya was the first woman to walk in space in 1984. Kathryn Sullivan became the first American woman to do so later the same year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-woman-walks-in-space-scripts-history-101636420144660.html
09-11-2021||World||SpaceX crew homecoming today after 6 months aloft||A SpaceX capsule carrying four astronauts left the International Space Station bound for Earth on Monday after spending six busy months aboard the orbital outpost.Since arriving on April 24, the crew of two Americans, a Frenchman and one Japanese astronaut conducted hundreds of experiments and helped upgrade the station's solar panels.They boarded their SpaceX Dragon dubbed "Endeavour" and undocked from the ISS at 2:05 pm US Eastern Time (1905 GMT), NASA announced.Endeavour will now loop around the ISS for around an hour-and-a-half to take photographs, the first such mission since a Russian Soyuz spaceship performed a similar maneuver in 2018.The Dragon, which is flying mostly autonomously, has a small circular window at the top of its forward hatch through which the astronauts can point their cameras.Splashdown is scheduled for 10:33 pm (0333 GMT Tuesday) off the coast of Florida, marking the end of the "Crew-2" mission. NASA is running a livestream."Proud to have represented France once again in space! Next stop, the Moon?" tweeted Thomas Pesquet, representing the European Space Agency (ESA).Their activities have included documenting the planet's surface to record human-caused changes and natural events, growing Hatch chile peppers and studying worms to better understand human health changes in space.Crew-2's departure was delayed a day by high winds.Bad weather and what NASA called a "minor medical issue" have also pushed back the launch of the next set of astronauts, on the Crew-3 mission, which is now set to launch Wednesday.Until then, the ISS will be inhabited by only three astronauts -- two Russians and one American.SpaceX began providing astronauts a taxi service to the ISS in 2020, ending nine years of US reliance on Russian rockets for the journey following the end of the Space Shuttle program.Broken toiletThe crew will face a final challenge on their journey home -- they will have to wear diapers after a problem was detected with the capsule's waste management system, forcing it to remain offline.They will have no access to a toilet from the time the hatch closes at 12:40 pm (1740 GMT) until after splashdown -- around 10 hours."Of course that's sub-optimal, but we're prepared to manage," NASA astronaut Megan McArthur said at a press conference."Space flight is full of lots of little challenges, this is just one more that we'll encounter and take care of in our mission."A SpaceX all-tourist crew encountered a similar waste-related problem during a September flight, which triggered an alarm system.NASA later said a tube had come unglued, sending urine to the capsule's fan system instead of a storage tank.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spacex-crew-homecoming-today-after-6-months-aloft-101636419275368.html
09-11-2021||World||Pakistan Taliban agree to ‘complete ceasefire’||Pakistan and local Taliban militants have agreed to a “complete ceasefire”, information minister Fawad Chaudhry said on Monday, after talks which the Taliban government in neighbouring Afghanistan helped to arrange.The Pakistani Taliban aim to overthrow the government and govern the South Asian nation of 220 million by enforcing their own brand of harsh Islamic law.The militants, also known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, are separate from the Afghan Taliban.“The ceasefire will keep on extending with the progress in the negotiations,” Chaudhry said in a statement. “The government of Pakistan and banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan have agreed on a complete ceasefire.”Separately, Pakistan said on Monday it has lifted a ban on a radical Islamist party behind a violent anti-France protest last month that triggered clashes with police, leaving six officers and four demonstrators dead.The development follows an agreement reached last week between the government of Prime Minister Imran Khan and Tehreek-e-Labiak Pakistan that the party would halt its march to Islamabad. The march was called to demand the closure of the French embassy in the Pakistani capital.The interior ministry lifted the ban late on Sunday, saying the move was in the “national interest”.. In response, the party on Monday afternoon ended its two-week protest along a highway in the city of Wazirabad, telling demonstrators that TLP’s leader Saad Rizvi would soon be released from jail and urging them to return to the city of Lahore to await his release.The party has waged an anti-France campaign after Paris-based satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo republished cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed - act deemed blasphemous by many Muslims.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-taliban-agree-to-complete-ceasefire-101636419598873.html
09-11-2021||World||Pressure on countries to act as UN talks enter final week||Developing nations accused richer countries of bargaining with the lives of billions of people on the climate crisis frontline on Monday, blasting insufficient commitments as COP26 talks enter their final week with trust in short supply.Countries remain starkly divided on key issues at the UN meeting, including how rapidly the world curbs carbon emissions and how to ramp up support for countries already battered by storms, floods and drought intensified by global heating.After a week of headline announcements from host Britain on ending deforestation and phasing out coal, experts say the underlying COP26 negotiations have progressed little.Countries are in Glasgow to work out how to implement the Paris Agreement’s goals of limiting temperature rises to between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius. And while recent announcements mean they have inched closer, many disputes remain unresolved.These include pushing for more ambitious national carbon reduction plans, providing a long-promised $100 billion annually to developing nations and rules governing carbon markets.“As the group least responsible for the climate crisis, but suffering most from its impact, we came to Glasgow with high expectations,” said Sonam Phuntsho Wangdi of Bhutan, who heads the Least Developed Nations negotiating bloc.He urged “strong commitments” from delegates at the UN talks, calling for faster emissions cuts. “Any compromise on limiting temperature rise in line to 1.5C in this decade will mean negotiating the lives of billions in the most vulnerable countries like ours.”With scientists warning that countries have until the end of the decade to slash emissions almost in half, former US President Barack Obama attended the summit to tell delegates “time really is running out”. He said the Paris Agreement of 2015 had made important progress, but stressed that the deal was just the beginning.“Most nations have failed to be as ambitious as they need to be,” he said, echoing current President Joe Biden in saying it was “disturbing” that neither the leaders of China or Russia had travelled to Glasgow.Earlier, COP26 President Alok Sharma said the first week of technical negotiations had “already concluded some important issues that will drive accelerated climate action”.But he said any preliminary conference decision text - over which ministers will haggle when they arrive in Glasgow later this week - had not yet materialised. “We have a lot of work to do across all issues that remain,” said Britain’s chief negotiator Archie Young.A senior diplomatic source told AFP that there was so much yet to be agreed that draft texts as they currently stood would be “illegible” for ministers.Dozens of nations have signed up to a COP26 initiative to end their use of coal - the most polluting fossil fuel -- within decades, including major users South Korea and Vietnam.But missing from the pact were the top consumers China, India and the United States.Major exporter Australia, which also declined to join the initiative, said Monday it would continue to sell coal for “decades into the future”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pressure-on-countries-to-act-as-un-talks-enter-final-week-101636419092764.html
09-11-2021||World||Developed nations trying to renegotiate climate finance||India flagged that developed countries are trying to renegotiate who or which countries will provide resources for climate change mitigation, and how often nationally determined contributions (NDCs) will be updated, violating principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities (CBDR, under which countries take climate action as per their respective capabilities) .During an informal stock taking of negotiations by Glasgow climate change conference (COP 26) President, Alok Sharma on Monday, India’s lead negotiator, Richa Sharma on behalf of BASIC (Brazil, South Africa, India, and China) countries said these issues are already specified in the Paris Agreement and should not be renegotiated.The Paris Agreement specifies that climate finance and technology support should flow from developed to developing countries. HT reported on Sunday that there are talks of including some developing countries particularly China, Saudi Arabia, even India as donors for the post 2025 new climate finance goal. India has also flagged the erosion of trust due to developed countries’ failure to deliver the $100 billion-a-year fund.“It’s been over a decade that the $100 billion was promised and the world is still waiting which is why trust in multilateralism at stake. There should be a structured process for a new higher finance goal which is a simple ask from developing countries”, she said. If not resolved this will jeopardise net zero commitments of parties and NDCs, Sharma added. India expects credible carbon markets and not cheap offsets, she pointed out.“Trust in multilateralism and credibility of the process is at stake. Post-2020 mitigation ambition and net zero pledges require significantly enhanced climate finance...BASIC would like to warn that lack of a serious approach to climate finance will jeopardize the enhanced mitigation and adaptation ambition as well as net zero pledges of parties,” she added.India’s view is seconded by many developing countries.Bolivia’s lead negotiator, Diego Pacheco, on behalf of Like Minded Developing Countries said: “ Let’s be honest they don’t want to define finance, talk about loss and damage, new finance goal. How can finance be achieved like this? The history of broken promises and unfulfilled commitments has a strong bearing of where we are today.” According to him, the principles of equity and CBDR are non-negotiable.Developed nations are resisting demands for a new finance goal for the post 2025 period, financial compensation for loss and damage, and an independent review of the promised $100 billion-a-year financing.“The stakes could not be higher for countries, communities and peoples on the front lines of the climate crisis... This is a race that we cannot afford to lose. It’s remarkable that [after] close to 30 years of international climate negotiations, adaptation finance represents a mere 25 %of total climate finance, despite what we know and what we’re seeing and experiencing all over the world,” said Selwin Hart, Special Adviser to the UN Secretary-General on Climate Action during his address at COP26However, Frans Timmermans, executive vice-president of the European Commission in-charge of the European Green Deal during a press conference by EU at COP 26 said: “We are very serious about the delivery of the USD 100 billion. Once delivered there can be some serious discussion on the post 2025 new finance goal.”Meanwhile climate economist, Nicholas Stern said on Monday that India had made among the “most important” NDC announcements.Former US President, Barak Obama attended the talks on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/developed-nations-trying-to-renegotiate-climate-finance-101636416690348.html
09-11-2021||World||US charges Ukrainian, Russian over cyberattack; seizes $6 million in ransom||The U.S. Justice Department has charged a suspect from Ukraine and a Russian national over a July ransomware attack on an American company, according to indictments made in court filings on Monday, and has seized $6 million in ransom payments.Yaroslav Vasinskyi, a Ukrainian national arrested in Poland last month, will face U.S. charges for deploying ransomware known as REvil, which has been used in hacks that have cost U.S. firms millions of dollars, the court filing showed.Vasinskyi conducted a ransomware attack over the July 4 weekend on Florida-based software firm Kaseya that infected up to 1,500 businesses around the world, according to the charges filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas.Vasinskyi and another alleged REvil operative, Russian national Yevgeniy Polyanin, were charged by the United States with conspiracy to commit fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering, among other charges.The Treasury Department also said the two operatives face sanctions for their role in ransomware incidents in the United States, as well as a virtual currency exchange called Chatex "for facilitating financial transactions for ransomware actors."Vasinskyi was responsible for the July 2021 ransomware activity against Kaseya, "which caused significant disruptions to the computer networks of Kaseya’s customer base," the Treasury said.One of the most widespread ransomware attacks came with the corruption of a widely used software tool made by Kaseya. Many Kaseya customers were infected at once with REvil encryption. Some paid ransoms, though a master decryption key was eventually recovered by authorities and distributed weeks later.The Treasury said more than $200 million in ransom payments were paid in Bitcoin and Monero. It added that Latvian and Estonian government agencies were vital to the investigation.Vasinskyi, 22, was being held in Poland pending U.S. extradition proceedings, while Polyanin, 28, remained at large.Up to 1,500 businesses around the world have been affected by ransomware attacks centered on Kaseya, which provides software tools to IT outsourcing shops. Such companies typically handle back-office work for companies too small or modestly resourced to have their own tech departments.The U.S. indictment of the Ukrainian hacker said he and other conspirators started deploying hacking software around April 2019 and "regularly" updated and refined it. The indictment also accused the hacker of laundering money obtained through a hacking extortion scheme.Europol said earlier on Monday that Romanian authorities on Nov. 4 arrested two individuals suspected of cyber-attacks deploying the REvil ransomware. Since February, law enforcement authorities have arrested three other affiliates of REvil, Europol added.Twelve suspects believed to have mounted ransomware attacks against companies or infrastructure in 71 countries were "targeted" in raids in Ukraine and Switzerland, Europol said on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-charges-ukrainian-russian-over-cyberattack-seizes-6-million-in-ransom-101636409407492.html
09-11-2021||World||India’s pledge among most substantive: Climate expert||India’s pledge was among the most substantive contributions at Glasgow climate change conference, Nicholas Stern, one of the world’s pre-eminent climate economists and Chair of the Grantham Research Institute at London School of Economics said on Monday during a meeting with journalists.“PM Modi’s panchamrit (nectar distilled from five ingredients; in this case, the five promises) was among the most substantive at COP26. Institutional reform will be needed to implement those which has already begun,” he said.India is focused on solar, green hydrogen and decarbonising the Railways by 2030 on all of which it will see tremendous returns, Stern explained -- but it will also need financial investments running into hundreds of billions of dollars. Some of this will come from public finance, some from external finance, and it will also come, increasingly, from companies looking for clean investment opportunities to meet their own pledges. India has to make itself an attractive destination for these companies, Stern said.He things COP26 will help to some extent. “I look at it like this: before Paris we were headed for 4 degree warming, after Paris it was 3 degree warming, after Glasgow it could be 2 degree warming.”He also thinks the ongoing summit was “unusual” because “PMs and Presidents came before the negotiations and declared their vision” an also because the “private sector is here in large numbers”. The first indicates intent and the second means companies “are looking for opportunities to invest”.And he thinks Indian PM Narendra Modi’s pledge was “among the most important”. “There has been progress on decarbonising steel sector, green hydrogen and electric vehicles in all of which India can play a major role.,” he said.Stern and Amar Bhattacharya, visiting professor in practice at Grantham Research Institute at LSE released a policy paper titled “Beyond the $100 billion: financing a sustainable and resilient future” which said developed countries’ commitment to mobilise $100 billion a year by 2020 to support developing countries on climate action is both an intensely important symbol of trust and foundational to progress on climate action by developing countries. Donors collectively fell short of the goal in 2020, but there is an opportunity to step up and deliver in 2022, it added. The paper also said that donors must double bilateral climate finance to $60 billion by 2025 from its 2018 level, and multilateral development banks (MDBs), triple their level of financing by 2025 from their 2018 levels.India will meet 50% of its energy needs from renewable energy sources and transition to net zero emissions by 2070, PM Narendra Modi said in his national statement during the World Leaders Summit last week in Glasgow.During his address to over 120 heads of countries, PM Modi said India will increase its non-fossil fuel energy capacity to 500 GW by 2030; fulfil 50% of its energy requirements from renewable energy sources by 2030; reduce its total projected carbon emissions by 1 billion tonnes between now and 2020; reduce the carbon intensity of its economy by 45% by 2030; and achieve the target of net zero emissions by 2070.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indias-pledge-among-most-substantive-climate-expert-101636406598856.html

These dignitaries include the Prime Minister of Qatar Sheikh Khalid bin Khalifa bin Abdulaziz Al Thani and the President of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan.The Dawn report said that the federal government has sent this list to the Sindh government, which approved it during a meeting of the provincial cabinet two weeks back. Prior to 2016-17, the special permits were directly granted by the federal government to Arab dignitaries, the report also said.The Qatari Prime Minister is allowed to hunt for the Houbara bustard in Jacobabad district while UAE President Al Nahyan is allowed to hunt for the bird in Sukkur, Ghotki, Sanghar, Nawabshah and Khairpur districts, it added.Other dignitaries include King of Bahrain Hammad bin Isa bin Salman Al-Khalifa, the deputy chairman of Dubai Police etc.Houbara bustard is an endangered bird species that is internationally protected. It migrates southwards every year to spend its winters in a relatively warmer environment in Pakistan. The Pakistani government specially invites Arab hunters for hunting the bird. Last year, special permits were issued to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and two other members of the royal family.However, this year, Pakistan is facing heat over the killing of a journalist who posted videos of hunting Houbara bustard by Arab dignitaries. Nazim Jokhio, a resident of Karachi, was killed on Wednesday after he posted a video, saying that he was being threatened over clips he posted on hunting trips by Arab dignitaries in Pakistan.“I am not scared. I am getting threats and will not apologise,” Jokhio said in the video.An international media watchdog has demanded an independent investigation into the journalist's killing and said that culprits must be identified and brought to justice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-allows-14-arab-dignitaries-to-hunt-for-houbara-bustard-in-sindh-101636386945707.html
09-11-2021||World||US warns of winter hurdles for Afghans to leave||Afghanistan's harsh winter will create new difficulties for people wishing to leave with the Kabul airport still in disrepair, a US official warned Monday.Thomas West, the US pointman on Afghanistan, said that the Taliban still has largely made good on promises to let US citizens and US long-term residents leave if they so choose after the insurgents' overthrow of the Western-backed government."I think the real challenge we face," West told reporters, "is potentially logistical especially as we head into the winter months.""Many runway lights are damaged and not functioning and the airport's ability to operate in the winter months is in question," he said.West voiced hope that the Taliban would work with partners on fixing up the airport, which is primarily accommodating costly and limited charter flights.Turkey and Qatar have both previously voiced a willingness to work on the airport.The US military took over the airport in August in the last days of its 20-year war in Afghanistan, evacuating tens of thousands of foreigners and Afghans who feared the return of the Taliban.Safe passage has been a key condition for the United States as it decides whether it can work with the Taliban.West, however, said it was too early to think about reopening the US Embassy in Kabul."When it comes to reopening our embassy in Kabul, I have to tell you candidly that we are not seriously thinking about taking that step at this time," he said."I think what we want to see is the establishment of a record of responsible conduct by the Taliban, of predictable conduct."No nation has recognized the Taliban although some nations, notably the insurgents' historic ally Pakistan, have pushed for greater engagement.The United States has previously said it will also watch to see whether the Taliban distances itself from Al-Qaeda and allows education of girls, two key concerns from the militants' 1996-2001 regime which imposed a draconian interpretation of Islam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-warns-of-winter-hurdles-for-afghans-to-leave-101636390645283.html

At present, people can only book an appointment for booster shots six months after their second vaccine dose."We're starting to see too many elderly people getting into hospital. Sadly, the Covid-19 jabs do wane," Johnson said on Monday, adding that the booster is very effective against Covid-19."It's (booster) a wonderful thing. People get 95% more protection... if you've gone over five months, you can go online and book your booster," he further said.The Prime Minister is heavily relying on booster shots as a major plank of his government's plan to avoid lockdown during winters. According to news agency Reuters on Saturday, around three in five eligible people over the age of 50 have received the shots and more than nine million people have received them so far in the UK.Daily Covid-19 cases are still above the 30,000-mark and the UK accounts for almost a tenth of the new infections recorded globally.Despite vaccination leading to a massive reduction in virus-related deaths, doctors have warned that hospitals in the country are facing pressure, Reuters further reported.Over 1,000 patients are being hospitalised daily. Speaking to Reuters, Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, said last week that the National Health Service (NHS) will be overwhelmed again."Even though Covid isn't responsible for as many of the ICU places as it has been in the past, it's still around a third of them, and that's going up.

09-11-2021||World||Afghans sell children to survive as food crisis deepens under Taliban: Report||With each passing day, the situation in Afghanistan is worsening under the new Taliban regime which does not have funds to procure food items and other essentials.Severe lack of funds and an unprecedented surge in food prices have left scores of Afghans hungry and some people are forced to sell their children to survive, according to the Canada-based think tank International Forum for Rights and Security (IFFRAS)."There are reports that 95 per cent of Afghans do not have enough food to eat while half of the population is expected to face acute levels of hunger as winter sets in early November," IFFRAS said.More than half the population of Afghanistan - a record 22.8 million people - will face acute food insecurity from November, a UN aid organisation said on Monday.This data regarding acute hunger was revealed in a new report issued by Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) by the Food Security and Agriculture Cluster of Afghanistan, co-led by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN and the UN World Food Programme (WFP).A WFP release stated that the combined impacts of drought, conflict, Covid-19, and the economic crisis, have severely affected lives, livelihoods, and people's access to food.The report's findings come as Afghanistan's harsh winter looms, threatening to cut off areas of the country where families desperately depend on humanitarian assistance to survive the freezing winter months.The IPC report has found that more than one in two Afghans will be facing crisis or emergency levels of acute food insecurity through November 2021 to March 2022 lean season, requiring urgent humanitarian interventions to meet basic food needs, protect livelihoods and prevent a humanitarian catastrophe.The report also notes that this is the highest number of acutely food insecure people ever recorded in the ten years the UN has been conducting IPC analyses in Afghanistan. Globally, Afghanistan is home to one of the largest number of people in acute food insecurity in both absolute and relative terms"It is urgent that we act efficiently and effectively to speed up and scale up our delivery in Afghanistan before winter cuts off a large part of the country, with millions of people - including farmers, women, young children and the elderly - going hungry in the freezing winter. It is a matter of life or death. We cannot wait and see humanitarian disasters unfolding in front of us - it is unacceptable!" said QU Dongyu, FAO Director-General."Afghanistan is now among the world's worst humanitarian crises - if not the worst - and food security has all but collapsed. This winter, millions of Afghans will be forced to choose between migration and starvation unless we can step up our life-saving assistance, and unless the economy can be resuscitated. We are on a countdown to catastrophe and if we don't act now, we will have a total disaster on our hands," said David Beasley, WFP Executive Director."Hunger is rising and children are dying. We can't feed people on promises - funding commitments must turn into hard cash, and the international community must come together to address this crisis, which is fast spinning out of control," Beasley warned.The IPC report reflects a 37 per cent increase in the number of Afghans facing acute hunger since the last assessment issued in April 2021, WFP said.Among those at risk are 3.2 million children under five who are expected to suffer from acute malnutrition by the end of the year. In October, WFP and UNICEF warned that one million children were at risk of dying from severe acute malnutrition without immediate life-saving treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghans-sell-children-to-survive-as-food-crisis-deepens-under-taliban-report-101636381713035.html
09-11-2021||World||China: Xi Jinping looks to secure another term as Communist party meet begins||A summit of the Communist Party of China (CPC) elite opened behind closed doors in Beijing on Monday as President Xi Jinping looks to secure both his legacy and future as China’s leader for a third term in 2022.The detailed agenda of the four-day meeting is secret but what is known is that on Monday Xi delivered a work report on behalf of CPC Central Committee’s powerful Politburo and explained a “…draft resolution on the major achievements and historical experience of the CPC’s 100 years of endeavours”.Interestingly, at a similar plenum in 2016, a year ahead of the once-in-five-year CPC congress, the party had anointed Xi Jinping as the “core” putting him at par with Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping, two of Communist China’s iconic leaders.“Chinese people who had suffered subjugation and bullying since the advent of modern times had stood up. The Chinese nation is advancing toward modernisation on all fronts and socialism has blazed a successful trail in the world’s most populous country,” an October statement by politburo had said, giving context to the ongoing meeting.The resolution - only the third such document in CPC’s history -- document is set to look back at key events in the party’s 100-year history, “…reinforce unity among the party and strengthen the authority and leadership of the CPC central committee with Xi at its core, as well as determine the party’s direction for the next few decades”, Chinese political analysts told official media.Cutting through CPC jargon and clutter, at the end of the four-day meeting on Thursday, Xi is expected to emerge as a leader at par with Mao and Deng.“At the 6th plenum, opening today in Beijing, the Chinese Communist Party will pass its third resolution on history. But all of the verbiage in the important document to be released this week will boil down to a simple political fact: XI Jinping will lead the party for years to come,” David Bandurski, editor at the University of Hong Kong’s China Media Project wrote.“The “resolution” will be unveiled in full to the world, so that we can all pick apart its finer points - beyond, that is, Xi Jinping’s blunt claim to power,” Bandurski wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/communist-party-meet-begins-in-china-xi-jinping-looks-to-secure-another-term-101636378078687.html
