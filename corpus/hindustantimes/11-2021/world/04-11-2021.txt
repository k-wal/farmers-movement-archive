However, it is yet to become clear how many of these employees are unvaccinated.For another 17 million people working in nursing homes, hospitals and other facilities that receive money from Medicare and Medicaid, there is no option for testing, but mandatory vaccination.Workers will need to receive either two doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine or one dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine by January 4. Unvaccinated employees would have to submit a verified negative test to the company at least once a week and wear face masks on the job. Employees who test positive would have to be removed from the workplace.Agency reports said workers will be able to ask for exemptions on medical or religious grounds.Biden Admn announcing details of 2 policies to fight COVID.

The requirements for masks and paid time off for shots will take effect from December 5.As the vaccines are free, the companies do not have to provide or pay for tests.The administration will face an immediate challenge from Republican state officials who are eager to fight Biden in court. More than two dozen Republicans serving as state attorneys general have indicated they plan to sue, arguing that only Congress can enact such sweeping requirements under emergency authority.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-admin-mandates-compulsory-covid-jabs-or-tests-for-private-firm-workers-101636031911599.html

Last week, Europe and Central Asia accounted for almost half of the world’s reported deaths from Covid-19. The outbreak has accelerating in Europe over the last four weeks as colder temperatures lead to more socializing indoors, while many countries have eased restrictions. The WHO has repeatedly said that the pandemic is not yet over, and that governments should keep public-health measures such as mask-wearing along with vaccinations.“According to one reliable projection, if we stay on this trajectory, we could see another half a million Covid-19 deaths in Europe and Central Asia by Feb. 1 next year,” Hans Kluge, the World Health Organization’s regional director for Europe, said at a media briefing on Thursday. He also said many countries will face stress on hospital beds at some point during that period. More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-says-europe-covid-epicentre-once-again-could-see-half-million-deaths-by-feb-101636026900175.html
04-11-2021||World||Germany reports record number of new Covid-19 cases||Germany's disease control agency on Thursday reported the highest number of new coronavirus infections since the outbreak of the pandemic.The Robert Koch Institute, or RKI, said 33,949 new cases had been registered in the last 24 hours, up from 28,037 daily cases a week ago. The previous record was 33,777 new cases on Dec. 18, 2020.The all-time high comes as the country's federal Health Minister Jens Spahn is set to meet with the 16 state health ministers to discuss how to limit the spread of the virus in the winter as intensive care units in the hospitals are starting to fill up again and infections among children are skyrocketing.On Thursday, the RKI reported 165 deaths, up from 126 a week ago. The overall number of people who have died from a COVID-19 infection in Germany has risen to to 96,192.Senior health officials have repeatedly appealed to German residents who haven't yet been vaccinated at all to get their shots, though Spahn acknowledged Wednesday that many of the holdouts can't be convinced.Official figures show that about two-thirds of Germany's population of 83 million has completed its first round of vaccination. Around 16.2 million people age 12 or above remain unvaccinated — including 3.2 million over-60s.Although officials agreed in August to make booster shots available to over-60s and nursing home residents and staff, only just over 2 million have been administered so far.Germany hasn't made coronavirus vaccinations obligatory for any professional groups, unlike some of its European counterparts. But regional governments have limited access to some indoor events and facilities to people who have been vaccinated, have recently recovered or been tested, and some are tightening those rules.Pressure has been growing to implement mandatory tests in nursing homes after several outbreaks were reported in senior citizen homes in recent days that have led to more than a dozen residents dying.The head of the association of family doctors, Ulrich Weigeldt, went even further on Thursday demanding mandatory coronavirus vaccinations for all employees working in nursing homes or hospitals.“No unvaccinated person should have contact with such a vulnerable group, either professionally or as a visitor," Weigeldt told daily tabloid Bild. "This applies to senior citizen homes and nursing homes as well as to intensive care units.” (AP) CPS||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-reports-record-number-of-new-covid-19-cases-101636017441915.html

The Environmental Working Group, in its report claimed that toxic contaminants have been discovered in the tap water, which is consumed by Americans on a daily basis.In the report, researchers discovered 56 new contaminants, including pesticides and radioactive materials, in tap water. The problem is mainly caused by the decaying infrastructure and the pollution from toxic "forever chemicals", that can be found in water, air, food or even in shampoo or makeup, according to the report.The researchers studied nearly 50,000 water systems over the past two years from across the US to arrive at conclusion.There are several thousand types of Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS), but their common characteristic is that they disintegrate extremely slowly, earning them the nickname "forever chemicals".Once ingested, these chemicals accumulate in the body. According to some studies, exposure to PFAS can lead to problems with fertility, developmental delays in children, increased risks of obesity or certain cancers (prostate, kidney and testicular). It can also increase cholesterol levels or even a decrease in the immune response to certain infections or after a vaccine.The PFAS can notably be found in things like food packaging, such as pizza boxes. It is also found in certain cleaning products, paints, varnishes or coatings. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of the US, due to the widespread use of products with PFAS, it makes it "challenging to study and assess the extent of potential human health and environmental risks." "Many PFAS are found in the blood of people and animals all over the world and are present at low levels in a variety of food products and in the environment," the EPA informed on its official website.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/toxic-forever-chemicals-contaminating-us-tap-water-claims-report-101636009169423.html

He said he thought it was possible that someone purposely placed real bullets, which look similar to dummies, in the box."We're afraid that could have been what happened here, that somebody intended to sabotage this set with a live round intentionally placed in a box of dummies," Bowles said on ABC television's "Good Morning America.""We're not saying anybody had any intent there was going to be a tragedy of homicide," he added, "but they wanted to do something to cause a safety incident on set. That's what we believe happened."A spokeswoman for producers Rust Movie Productions had no comment on Bowles' remarks. The company has said it is investigating the incident and had received no official complaints about safety on the set in Santa Fe, New Mexico.Authorities are investigating the matter and no charges have been filed against anyone involved."Never in a million years did Hannah think that live rounds could have been in the 'dummy' round box," Bowles said in a statement later on Wednesday.Cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was killed on Oct. 21 when a gun Baldwin was holding released a live bullet, police said. Baldwin had been told by assistant director Dave Halls that the gun was "cold", an industry term meaning it is safe to use.Bowles said Gutierrez had checked the gun before giving it to Halls. She spun the cylinder and showed Halls each of the rounds, which she believed were six dummy rounds, he said. Halls then took the gun into the church where Baldwin was rehearsing a scene.He said that Gutierrez took her job seriously, had given Baldwin and other actors on the film firearms training, and "did everything in her power to ensure a safe set."Before the shooting, camera operators had quit the film to protest against what they said were long hours and other objectionable working conditions, authorities in Santa Fe have said.Asked who would intentionally place live ammunition with dummy rounds, Bowles said on NBC's "Today" show that he believed it could be a person who wanted "to prove a point, to say that they're disgruntled, they're unhappy"."And we know that people had already walked off the set the day before," he said.Baldwin, who was also a producer on the film, has said he is heartbroken and is cooperating with authorities. On Tuesday, he shared a message on social media from a crew member who disputed reports of chaos and a lax attitude toward safety on the set.An attorney for Halls did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/somebody-intended-to-sabotage-lawyer-on-tragedy-on-baldwin-movie-set-101636007469478.html

Faiz Siddiqui had said in his plea before a court in the United Kingdom (UK) that his human rights were violated.But the Court of Appeal dismissed his petition, saying he is not entitled even to a penny, the Daily Mail report said. It also rejected the claims made by Siddiqui that his rights had been breached, it added.Oxford-educated Siddiqui, who also trained as a lawyer, practiced at top law firms and also worked at Ernst & Young as a tax advisor. He is a qualified solicitor but has been jobless since 2011. Siddiqui has been living rent free for 20 years in a £1 million home near Hyde Park in London, which is owned by his parents Rakshanda, 69, and Javed, 71.They have also been giving Siddiqui £400 every week for his expenses and paying his bills and other expenses. That support was reduced after a family dispute.He demanded the money be increased and the support from “enormously wealthy” parents to continue for life, reported Daily Mail.But the judge said in the order, "Parents should be under no legal duty to support their adult children, however grave their need," according to Daily Mail.The lawyers of Rakshanda and Javed, who live in Dubai, described Faiz as "difficult and demanding" and said that his parents were "long-suffering".This was first of its kind test case in the UK and Faiz Siddiqui was backed by a human rights lawyer.He had earlier sued Oxford University for £1,000,000 in 2018 over his failure to get first-class honours, claiming what he was taught was inadequate. He lost that case too.The judge hearing his case had said that Siddiqui's "inadequate preparation" and "lack of academic discipline" were the reasons he under performed in his exams.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jobless-man-41-who-sued-parents-seeking-maintenance-for-life-loses-appeal-101636006454206.html
04-11-2021||World||China rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal; intends to 'produce over 1,000 warheads by 2030': Pentagon||The People's Republic China (PRC) is rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal and "intends to produce over 1,000 warheads by 2030", a new report by the Pentagon has revealed. In a report titled "Military and Security Developments Involving the People's Republic of China (PRC) 2021", the headquarters of the United States Department of Defense said that the accelerating pace of the PRC's nuclear expansion may enable the country "to have up to 700 deliverable nuclear warheads by 2027"."The PRC likely intends to have at least 1,000 warheads by 2030," the report also stated, adding that it will significantly outpace Pentagon estimates from last year. In 2020, the US Defense Department had projected that China would have 400 nuclear warheads by 2030.The report also said that China is heavily investing in and expanding the number of its land, sea and air-base nuclear delivery platforms and constructing the infrastructure necessary to support the expansion."The PRC has possibly already established a nascent 'nuclear triad' with the development of a nuclear capable air-launched ballistic missile (ALBM) and improvement of its ground and sea-based nuclear capabilities," Pentagon stated in the report.It also informed that the country is supporting its nuclear expansion by "increasing its capacity to produce and separate plutonium by constructing fast breeder reactors and reprocessing facilities.""New developments in 2020 further suggest that the PRC intends to increase the peacetime readiness of its nuclear forces by moving to a launch-on-warning (LOW) posture with an expanded silo-based force," the Pentagon also stated in the report that was released on Wednesday.This comes in the backdrop of rising tension between the United States and China over Taiwan, where it had flown a record number of military flights, sparking concerns of a potential conflict. According to reports, China sent over 200 aircraft to Taiwan for exercises in the month of October, to exert pressure on the self-ruled island.The United States, which backed the democratic government in Taiwan, has been trading warnings with China over the same. China claims the island as part of its own territory and views any foreign intervention over Taiwan as interference in its domestic affairs.Meanwhile, the report also mentioned that China is seeking to establish a more robust overseas logistics and basing infrastructure to allow China's People's Liberation Army "to project and sustain military power at greater distances". "Beyond its base in Djibouti, the PRC is pursuing additional military facilities to support naval, air, ground, cyber, and space power projection," the Pentagon said in the report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-rapidly-expanding-its-nuclear-arsenal-intends-to-produce-over-1-000-warheads-by-2030-pentagon-101635998650705.html
04-11-2021||World||Pentagon issues detailed report on China. From nuclear woes to defence plans, here are key points||The Pentagon, the headquarters of the United States Department of Defense, released on Wednesday its comprehensive report on China, in which it detailed a host of things – including the missions and tasks with which Beijing is equipping armed forces in the “new era” and all-inclusive data on China's defense contracts, its resources and technology for modernisation, and the Dragon's growing global influence under president Xi Jinping. It also contains a host of elaborate data on the Taiwan crisis, the India-China border standoff, as well as the underlying pattern in the multilateral exercises conducted by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) last year.China sought to prevent India from deepening ties with USThe Pentagon said in its report that despite ongoing diplomatic and military dialogues to reduce border tensions, China has continued “taking incremental and tactical actions” to press its claims at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with India and has unsuccessfully sought to prevent New Delhi from deepening its relationship with the United States.The Pentagon regularly reports to the Congress on the Indo-Chinese military standoff in eastern Ladakh. The Department of Defense has categorically said China is indulging in aggressive and coercive behaviour with its neighbours, India in particular. In addition, a substantial reserve force from the Tibet and Xinjiang Military Districts were deployed to the interior of Western China to provide a rapid response to the border situation, the report said.Border standoff: China reluctant to back off from LACThe Pentagon confirmed that in 2020, China built a large 100-home civilian village in a piece of “disputed territory” between the Chinese Tibet Autonomous Region and India's Arunachal Pradesh state in the eastern sector of the LAC.At the height of the border standoff between China and India in 2020, the Chinese Army even installed a fiber-optic network in the remote areas of the western Himalayas to provide faster communications and increased protection from foreign interception, the report said. It added that the PLA field commanders view near-real-time intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, and situational data as well as redundant and reliable communications as essential to streamlining decision-making processes and shortening response timelines.Meanwhile, China’s state-controlled media continues to forcefully assert Beijing's intent to refuse any territorial concessions demanded by India. It has continued to blame India for provoking the standoff through India's increased infrastructure development near the LAC and using this as justification, China refused to withdraw forces till India's forces have withdrawn behind the Chinese version of the LAC and ceased infrastructure improvements in the area.China boosting its nuclear arsenal much faster than expectedChina is expanding its nuclear arsenal much more quickly than anticipated, narrowing the gap with the United States, the Pentagon said in its latest report, pointing out that Beijing could have as many as 700 deliverable nuclear warheads by 2027, and could top 1,000 by 2030 – an arsenal two-and-a-half times the size of what the Pentagon predicted only a year ago.The report said that China is actively investing in, and expanding its land, sea, and air-based means to deploy nuclear weapons, building the infrastructure necessary to support this major expansion of its nuclear forces, not unlike the other two leading nuclear powers – the United States and Russia.The Pentagon, however, said that it is unlikely that China is seeking a capability to launch an unprovoked nuclear strike on a nuclear-armed adversary – primarily the United States – but this current expansion is aimed at deterring attacks from others by maintaining a credible threat of nuclear retaliation.Potential customers of Chinese weapons consider PRC arms to be of lower qualityPotential customers consider arms made by China to be of lower quality and reliability, however, some countries still buy them as they are less expensive, the Pentagon said in its recent report.Arms transfers are a key component in China's foreign policy, used in conjunction with other types of assistance to complement initiatives undertaken as part of China's ‘One Belt, One Road’ strategy.Beijing sells major systems such as UAVs, submarines, and fighter aircraft to customers like Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Pakistan. The PRC has supplied its strike-capable Caihong or Wing Loongfamilies of armed Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to at least Pakistan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE, Algeria, Serbia, and Kazakhstan.Beijing also supplies naval vessels, highlighted by Pakistan's purchase of eight Yuan-class submarines for more than $3 billion, according to the report.China conducts ‘influence operations’ to target media and cultural institutions in other countriesChina conducts influence operations, which target cultural institutions, media organisations, business, academic, and policy communities in the US, other countries, and international institutions, to achieve outcomes favourable to its strategic objectives, the Pentagon said.The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) seeks to condition domestic, foreign, and multilateral political establishments and public opinion to accept Beijing's narratives and remove obstacles preventing the attainment of goals. CCP leaders probably consider open democracies, including the US, as more susceptible to influence operations than other types of governments.The PLA has emphasised the development of its “Three Warfares” concept – comprised of psychological warfare, public opinion warfare, and legal warfare – in its operational planning since at least 2003, the US Defence Department said. The PLA will also likely continue to develop its digital influence capabilities by incorporating advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) to improve the quality and deniability of its messaging. (With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pentagon-issues-detailed-report-on-china-from-nuclear-woes-to-defence-plans-here-are-key-points-101635992976765.html

There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but the attack bore the hallmarks of previous IS strikes against the Taliban.The two groups are bitter rivals, and IS has stepped up attacks since the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in August.Wednesday’s bomb went off in the city of Jalalabad, the capital of Nangarhar province.A Taliban district commander in the city confirmed the blast and said four Taliban fighters were wounded. The commander, who identified himself as Mubariz did not provide details about those killed in the attack, saying the investigation continues.The Jalalabad attack came a day after IS attackers set off an explosion at the gate of a 400-bed military hospital in the capital of Kabul, killing three women, a child and three Taliban guards. Five assailants were also killed in the attack. Initial reports said 25 were killed in the attack.Taliban ban US dollarsThe Taliban government has banned the use of foreign currencies in Afghanistan in a surprise move that could weigh on an economy struggling with a cash crunch and further isolate the country.The militant group’s spokesman Zabihullah Mujahed said the Afghans should use the local currency in view of the economic situation. Much of Afghanistan’s local trade is done in US dollars.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bomb-targets-taliban-kills-two-in-is-k-hub-101635988286982.html

It is a major step forward for our nation in our fight to defeat the virus.”The CDC said the vaccination of children could begin “as soon as possible”.Distribution of the paediatric vaccine has already begun and plans afoot to scale up to full capacity starting on November 8, CDC said, adding that vaccines will be available at multiple locations, including paediatric health care provider offices, pharmacies and Federally Qualified Health Centers (HRSA).Meanwhile, daily cases and deaths in Russia remained at their highest numbers of the pandemic on Wednesday as more regions announced extending existing restrictions in an effort to tame the surge.Russia’s state coronavirus task force reported 40,443 new confirmed cases from a day earlier.

"China's actions in response to climate change are real."He also made a jibe at Washington by adding that the United States pulling out of the Paris Agreement under Biden's predecessor Donald Trump had harmed global climate governance and the implementation of the accord.Biden has apologised for Trump's decision.COP26 has been billed as vital for the continued viability of the 2015 Paris Agreement under which nations promised to limit global temperature rises to "well below" 2C and to work for a safer 1.5C cap.At the summit on Tuesday, nearly one hundred nations joined the US and European Union initiative to cut emissions of methane -- a potent greenhouse gas -- by at least 30 percent this decade, with China among notable absentees.Experts say the initiative could have a powerful short-term impact on global heating."It just is a gigantic issue and they walked away. How do you do that and claim to be able to have any leadership?" Biden told journalists before flying out of Glasgow. “It's been a big mistake, quite frankly, for China not showing up. The rest of the world looked at China and said: ‘What value are they providing?’”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/need-actions-not-words-china-hits-back-after-us-pans-xi-s-cop26-noshow-101635985762016.html
