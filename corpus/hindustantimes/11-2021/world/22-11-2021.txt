22-11-2021||World||2019 Lanka Easter Sunday terror attack: Ex-police chief indicted charged with criminal negligence||Sri Lanka's former police chief Pujith Jayasundera was on Monday indicted with 855 charges of criminal negligence for failing to act despite receiving prior intelligence warnings in the 2019 Easter Sunday terror attack that killed nearly 270 people, including 11 Indians.The Attorney General read out the charges when the case was taken up before a three-judge High Court bench comprising Justices Namal Balalle, Aditya Patabendige and Mohamed Irshadeen on Monday.A total of 855 charges of criminal negligence were levelled against Jayasundera, who pleaded not guilty.Jayasundera was present in the courtroom when the charges were read out against him in the case, which has over 1,200 witnesses, lawyers said.His lawyers insisted that the former Inspector General was not guilty of ignoring prior intelligence.Former defence secretary Hemasiri Fernando, who was a key member in the defence ministry when the attack took place in April 2019, also faces similar charges.Jayasundera and Fernando were suspended from service and arrested in connection with the case.However, they were later released on bail.Both were accused by the then President Maithripala Sirisena for negligence over alleged inaction to prevent attacks despite the availability of prior intelligence on the attacks.Police have filed over 23,000 charges against suspects for conspiring, aiding and abetting the attacks.Nine suicide bombers belonging to local Islamist extremist group National Thawheed Jamaat (NTJ) linked to ISIS carried out a series of devastating blasts that tore through three churches and as many luxury hotels on April 21, 2019, killing nearly 270 people, and injuring over 500.The attack stirred a political storm as the then government headed by President Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was blamed for its inability to prevent the attacks despite prior intelligence being made available.During his tenure, Sirisena formed a presidential panel to probe the attacks.The special presidential probe found Sirisena himself along with a host of other top defence officials, including Fernando and Jayasundera, guilty of ignoring prior intelligence.The panel report had recommended criminal action against them.The Catholic Church in Sri Lanka had repeatedly expressed dissatisfaction over the Easter Sunday terror attack investigations undertaken by the government.It has demanded action against those named in the report for their negligence to stop the attacks despite having prior intelligence.On a day when Jayasundera and Fernando had a torrent of charges levelled against them, leading Catholic priest Rev Father Cyril Gamini visited the Criminal Investigation Department to record his statement.He visited the CID for the third day as he was summoned to appear before them.Earlier this month, Gamini had filed a fundamental rights application fearing a possible arrest for questioning the involvement of the Sri Lankan state intelligence operatives in the Easter attack.On Sunday, members of the Catholic community held protests in remembrance of the people who had lost their lives in the attack .They appealed to the Sri Lankan government to ensure speedy justice and allow trials to be conducted with undue political interference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2019-lanka-easter-sunday-terror-attack-ex-police-chief-indicted-charged-with-criminal-negligence-101637598813585.html

The meeting was also attended by foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Pakistan Army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa and National Security Adviser Moeed Yousaf. Khan “announced Pakistan’s decision to allow the 50,000 MT of wheat India has offered to provide Afghanistan as humanitarian assistance to go through Pakistan as soon as modalities are finalized with the Indian side,” according to an official statement issued after the meeting.“Pakistan will also facilitate the return of Afghan patients who had gone to India for medical treatment and are stuck there, the Prime Minister announced,” the statement added.Hundreds of Afghan nationals, including patients seeking medical treatment and their relatives or attendants, have been stuck in India for months following the Taliban takeover in Afghanistan in mid-August.In recent weeks, some of them made their way back to Afghanistan via Iran on a handful of specially arranged flights. However, the fare for this route was $850 and out of the reach of many of the stranded Afghans.India offered to supply the 50,000 tonnes of wheat as humanitarian aid via the Wagah land border crossing with Pakistan several weeks ago. However, Pakistan did not respond positively to the move, Indian officials have said.Even a Taliban delegation that recently visited Islamabad had raised the issue of allowing the shipment of the wheat with the top Pakistani leadership.During the meeting in Islamabad, Khan instructed all Pakistani ministries to “facilitate Afghans to the maximum”. He ordered the immediate shipment of in-kind humanitarian assistance worth Pakistani ₹5 billion, including 50,000 tonnes of wheat, emergency medical supplies, winter shelters and other items. He also approved in-principle tariff and sales tax reduction on key Afghan exports to Pakistan.Khan also ordered authorities to continue providing free Covid-19 vaccination for all Afghans entering Pakistan from land borders. Pakistan started free vaccination of Afghans on November 13. NSA Moeed Yusuf, who is also the convener of the cell, made a presentation on the current economic situation in Afghanistan and the progress made by the cell in coordinating Pakistani efforts for humanitarian assistance and border facilitation for Afghans.Khan instructed Yusuf to visit Afghanistan to “hold delegation-level talks and agree on specific areas where immediate capacity-building support shall be provided to Afghans”, the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/khan-allows-indian-aid-to-afghanistan-to-pass-through-pak-once-modalities-are-finalised-101637593307976.html
22-11-2021||World||Was SUV driver in Wisconsin parade crash fleeing a crime?||Investigators are looking into whether the SUV driver who plowed through a Christmas parade in suburban Milwaukee, killing at least five people and injuring more than 40, was fleeing from a crime, a law enforcement official told The Associated Press.The joyous scene of marching bands and children dancing in Santa hats and waving pompoms turned deadly in an instant on Sunday, as the SUV sped through barricades and struck dancers, musicians and others.One video showed a woman screaming, “Oh my God!” repeatedly as a group of young dancers was struck. A father talked of going “from one crumpled body to the other” in search of his daughter. Members of a “Dancing Grannies” club were among those killed.One person was taken into custody after a Waukesha police officer opened fire to try to stop the vehicle, authorities said.Investigators were questioning the person about an earlier crime, which the official described to AP as an argument involving a knife. The official, who cautioned the investigation was still in the early stages, was not authorized to discuss the case publicly and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.Waukesha Police Chief Dan Thompson gave no immediate details about the person in custody or any possible motive.Thompson said that he did not know if the driver was hit by the officer’s bullets but that no bystanders were wounded.On its social media account, the city of Waukesha put the number of dead at at least five.The horror was recorded by the city’s livestream and onlookers' cellphones. One video shows the moment the SUV broke through the barricades and the sound of what apparently were several gunshots.Another video shows a young child dancing in the street as the SUV speeds by, just a few feet from her, before it hurtles into parade participants a few hundred feet ahead. One video, of dancers with pompoms, ends with a group of people tending to a girl on the ground.“There were pompoms and shoes and spilled hot chocolate everywhere. I had to go from one crumpled body to the other to find my daughter,” Corey Montiho, a Waukesha school district board member, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. “My wife and two daughters were almost hit. Please pray for everybody. Please pray.”The Milwaukee Dancing Grannies posted on its Facebook page that some of its members were among the dead. The organization describes itself as a “group of grannies that meet once a week to practice routines for summer and winter parades.”“Our group was doing what they loved, performing in front of crowds in a parade putting smiles on faces of all ages, filling them with joy and happiness,” the post said.“Those who died were extremely passionate Grannies. Their eyes gleamed ... joy of being a Grannie. They were the glue ... held us together.”A Roman Catholic priest, parishioners and Waukesha Catholic schoolchildren were among those injured, the Archdiocese of Milwaukee said.Chris Germain, co-owner of the Aspire Dance Center studio, had about 70 people in the parade, including children as young as 2 being pulled in wagons and participants up to 18 years old.Germain, whose 3-year-old daughter was in the parade, said he was driving at the head of their entry when he saw a maroon SUV that “just blazed right past us.” A police officer ran past in chase. Germain said he jumped out of his own SUV and gathered the girls who were with him to safety.Then he walked forward to see the damage.“There were small children laying all over the road. There were police officers and EMTs doing CPR on multiple members of the parade,” he said.Angelito Tenorio, a West Allis alderman who is running for Wisconsin state treasurer, said he was watching the parade with his family when they saw the SUV come speeding into the area.“Then we heard a loud bang,” Tenorio said. “And after that, we just heard deafening cries and screams from the crowd, from the people at the parade. And people started rushing, running away with tears in their eyes, crying.”The Waukesha school district canceled classes Monday and said extra counselors would be on hand for students and staff. The parade’s list of participants included cheer, dance and band entries associated with district schools.Gov. Tony Evers said he and his wife were “praying for Waukesha tonight and all the kids, families, and community members affected by this senseless act.”The parade, held each year on the Sunday before Thanksgiving, is sponsored by the city’s Chamber of Commerce. This year’s event, the 59th, had the theme of “comfort and joy.”Waukesha is a western suburb of Milwaukee, and about 55 miles (90 kilometers) north of Kenosha, where Kyle Rittenhouse was acquitted Friday of charges stemming from the fatal shooting of two men and the wounding of a third during unrest in that city in August 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/was-suv-driver-in-wisconsin-parade-crash-fleeing-a-crime-101637592023356.html

This does not speak well of the relations between our nations,” Duterte said.Duterte was referring to the actions of three Chinese coast guard vessels that is said to have blocked and used water cannon on resupply boats headed towards a Philippine-occupied atoll in the sea.The United States called the Chinese actions “dangerous, provocative and unjustified” and warned that an armed attack on Philippine vessels would invoke US mutual defence commitments, a Reuters report said.Speaking at the summit, Xi said: “We need to pursue dialogue instead of confrontation, build partnerships instead of alliances. China firmly opposes hegemonism and power politics. China will never seek hegemony, still less bully smaller countries.”China’s sweeping claims of sovereignty over the SCS has set it against Asean members Vietnam and the Philippines while Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan, which Beijing claims as a breakaway region, are also part of the ongoing dispute.Announcing the “comprehensive strategic partnership”, Xi Jinping said it was “...a new milestone in the history of our relations and will inject new impetus into peace, stability, prosperity and development of our region and the world”.“China supports Asean’s efforts to build a nuclear weapons-free zone and is prepared to sign the Protocol to the Treaty on the Southeast Asia Nuclear Weapon-Free Zone as soon as possible,” Xi said.China is ready to provide with another $1.5 billion in development assistance in the next three years to support Asean countries’ fight against Covid-19 and economic recovery, Xi said.The summit was held without a representative from Myanmar, reports said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-not-a-bully-does-not-seek-hegemony-xi-jinping-tells-asean-leaders-101637578666225.html

Others thought it was a countermeasure that could hurt the ability of missile defense systems to knock out the hypersonic weapon, which can carry a nuclear warhead, in a battle.The Financial Times reported last month that China conducted hypersonic weapons tests on July 27 and again on Aug. 13, raising concern in Washington about Beijing’s advancing military capabilities. China’s Foreign Ministry said in October the nation had tested “a routine spacecraft” to see if it was reusable, an assertion ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian repeated Monday at a regular press briefing in Beijing.In an apparent effort to dismiss the idea the spacecraft launched anything, Zhao added: “After separating from the spacecraft before its return, the supporting devices will burn up when they are falling in the atmosphere.”If China’s tests of hypersonic weapons are confirmed, it would suggest that President Xi Jinping may be exploring orbital strikes as a way to counter American advancements in shooting down ballistic missiles before they can threaten the US homeland. Last year, the US Navy successfully intercepted a mock intercontinental ballistic missile.“I certainly can’t think of any technical precedent to a hypersonic glide vehicle releasing some sort of payload -- implied to be a missile by the FT story,” said Ankit Panda, the Stanton senior fellow in the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “I do wonder, however, if this ‘missile’ may have been some other sort of payload, perhaps a countermeasure or some other sort of support mechanism,” he said. Panda added there are questions about the military utility of such a demonstration, and the international community shouldn’t assume China intends to deploy such a weapon in the field.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-hypersonic-missile-shows-xi-s-interest-in-launching-orbital-strikes-101637572515610.html

The protesters also demanded the restoration of Hong Kong’s greater autonomy curbed by China’s implementation of the draconian national security law in the global financial hub. They held banners which read ‘Free Hong Kong’, ‘Fight for freedom’, ‘Stand with HK’.The organisers said the protest was a great success as people in large numbers gathered at the venue.China has long been accused of violating human rights and stifling dissenting voices. It is also facing allegations of trying to hide the early data related to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. Former US secretary of state Mike Pompeo also joined growing calls for a boycott of the Beijing Winter Olympics next year."The CCP has disappeared reporters writing about Wuhan virus, docs telling the truth about CCP labs, a prof tennis player, Uighurs, Hong Kongers & the head of Interpol. Let's disappear the Olympics from them and hold it in a place the world can be proud of. #BoycottBeijingOlympics," Pompeo tweeted.The call for a boycott has gained momentum after US President Joe Biden recently said his administration was considering a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. Biden was asked about the possibility of a boycott during his meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The US president indicated that the boycott could be on the card as he said it was “something we are considering.”A diplomatic boycott means the White House won’t be sending a delegation for the opening and closing ceremonies. The athletes, however, would attend the event.Reports suggest that the United Kingdom is also actively discussing the possibility of not sending officials to the Beijing Winter Olympics.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/friends-of-canada-india-protest-against-beijing-winter-olympics-in-vancouver-101637562974810.html

Auckland, which is the epicentre of the outbreak, will start at red.Ardern said about 83% of eligible New Zealanders are fully vaccinated now and if all those people who are due for their second shot get it, that number would rise to 88%.The government previously said the country would drop lockdown measures and move into the new traffic-light system to manage outbreaks after 90% of the eligible population was fully vaccinated.New Zealand enforced some of the tightest pandemic restrictions among OECD nations that has helped limit the spread of Covid-19 so far and helped the economy bounce back faster than many of its peers.The country has so far reported about 7,000 cases in all and 39 deaths. Its international borders still remain shut to the rest of the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-to-end-tough-covid-curbs-adopt-new-virus-fighting-system-from-dec-101637557607984.html
22-11-2021||World||Australia to reopen to fully vaccinated foreign visa holders from December 1||Australia will allow foreign visa holders to enter the country from the start of December, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Monday, the latest step to restart international travel and support its economy.Australia shut its international border in May 2020 and allowed only restricted numbers of citizens and permanent residents to enter in a bid to curtail the spread of Covid-19.The rules were relaxed in recent weeks to allow foreign family members of citizens to enter, and Morrison said this will be scaled up from Dec. 1 to allow vaccinated students, business visa holders and refugees to arrive."The return of skilled workers and students to Australia is a major milestone in our pathway back," Morrison told reporters in Canberra. Australia will also allow in vaccinated tourists from South Korea and Japan from Dec 1, he said.The return of foreign students, who are worth about A$35 billion ($25 billion) a year to the Australian economy, will be a major boost for the education sector.More than 235,000 foreigners, including about 160,000 students, held visas for Australia at the end of October, government data showed.Many Australian universities have come to rely on foreign students, who make up about 21% of total enrolments, and the border closure led higher education facilities to lay off hundreds of staff.Many students locked out of Australia have said they would switch to alternative universities if they were unable to begin face-to-face learning in 2022.The relaxation of the border rules is also expected to ease labour shortages, which threaten to stymie an economic rebound."This will be critical relief for businesses who are struggling to find workers just to keep their doors open and for those who need highly specialised skills to unlock big projects," said Jennifer Westacott, chief executive of the industry body, the Business Council.Border rules, swift lockdowns and tough social distancing rules helped Australia to keep its coronavirus numbers far lower than many other comparable countries, with around 200,000 cases and 1,948 deaths.Most new infections are being reported in Victoria state, which logged 1,029 cases on Monday. New South Wales, home to Sydney, reported 180 cases. Other states and territories are Covid-free or have very few cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-to-reopen-to-fully-vaccinated-foreign-visa-holders-from-december-1-101637555429350.html

The fishermen were not able to earn their livelihood as big trawlers were allowed for fishing at Makran Coast,” he said at a public meeting last month.Rehman said despite building the Gwadar Deep Sea Port, the people of the city were still jobless and the government has done nothing about it."It is an insult for the sons of soil when they are stopped at checkpoints and inquired about their whereabouts," he was quoted as saying by The Express Tribune.The protests are part of growing discontent with China’s presence in Gwadar, whose port is an integral part of the USD 60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor project (CPEC), the flagship project of China's multi-billion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).India has protested to China over the CPEC as it traverses through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). The massive infrastructure project connects China's Xinjiang province with Gwadar port in Pakistan's Balochistan province.Gwadar port has long been portrayed as the jewel in the CPEC crown, but in the process, the city has become the very embodiment of a security state.The authorities’ priorities are geared towards securing the port and its ancillary interests; the welfare of those for whom the area is home counts for little. Far from the port being a harbinger of an economic boom, the opposite has happened, The Dawn newspaper reported on Friday.Existing privations have deepened; people’s mobility is restricted by security forces and there is unwarranted questioning of their activities. Many say they are made to feel like strangers in their own land, it said.Adding to the miseries of a large number of fishermen among the populace, the government, they complain, has issued licences to Chinese trawlers to fish in the waters off the coast. Their small boats cannot possibly compete, as a result of which their livelihoods are being squeezed. This is the petri dish of discontent from which have sprung the recent protests, it added.Balochistan is home to a long-running violent insurgency, and China’s presence in Gwadar has been the cause of much social unrest and led to anti-Chinese sentiment.It has also given a fillip to Baloch militant insurgent groups, who have carried out terrorist attacks in protest at CPEC projects.This year in August, a suicide bomber attacked a motorcade carrying Chinese personnel on the Gwadar East Bay Expressway project in which one Chinese was injured and two local children were killed.The Chinese embassy after the incident asked the Pakistan government to beef up security for the CPEC projects and the Chinese personnel working on them.In October last year, gunmen killed at least 14 people near Ormara on the coastal highway after ambushing a convoy of vehicles travelling from Gwadar to Karachi and in 2019 five people, including a Pakistani Navy soldier, were killed in an attack on the luxury Pearl Continental hotel in Gwadar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/protests-erupt-in-pakistan-s-gwadar-amid-growing-backlash-against-cpec-101637551638498.html

Some of the individuals were children and there are some fatalities as a result of this incident," Thompson told reporters.Asked about the fatalities, Thompson said: "I don't have an exact number at this time."It was not known whether the incident was related to terrorism, but an earlier shelter-in-place order in the town of around 72,000 had been lifted, he added.A video posted online showed a red SUV plowing through the parade, appearing to run over more than a dozen people before crowds ran from sidewalks to offer assistance. Moment the vehicle entered the crowd at the Christmas parade in Waukesha Wisconsin. pic.twitter.com/aOx2165XYmIn another video, police appeared to open fire on the vehicle as it crashed through street barriers.Thompson said an officer fired shots at the vehicle and no bystanders were injured.Belen Santamaria, her husband, and their three-year old daughter were planning to join the late afternoon parade with their Catholic Church. But Santamaria, a 39-year old Mexican factory worker, woke up on Sunday with a backache, so the family watched the procession from the sidewalk instead."The SUV came by at full speed," said Santamaria. "Then I started to hear people screaming."She hid in a restaurant with their daughter while her husband, 39-year old delivery worker Jesus Ochoa, ran ahead to try to help injured people. He said he heard through other members of their church that roughly 10 members, mostly Latinos and both adults and children, are injured."I was going to be there, walking," Santamaria said. "The SUV would have hit us too."DANCE GROUPS HITA woman told Milwaukee's Fox6 TV station that the SUV hit a dance team of girls between 9 and 15 years old. She said the immediate reaction was silence, followed by screaming, running and checking on those injured, Fox6 reported. Video on social media showed small groups surrounding injured girls with white pompoms scattered around.One witness said the driver also hit a group of "Dancing Grannies" and at least one person flipped over the hood of the SUV, according to Milwaukee's WISN-TV, an ABC affiliate."Members of the group and volunteers were impacted and we are waiting for word on their conditions," the Milwaukee Dancing Grannies said on their Facebook page. "Please keep the Grannies, all those injured, and all those who witnessed this horrible event in your thoughts and prayers."The local CBS affiliate later showed a picture on Twitter of what appeared to be the red SUV involved with its hood crumpled and front fender hanging off, parked in a driveway.Another witness estimated the SUV was going about 40 mph (64 kph) when it hit the crowd parading down the street, the TV station said."As we were walking back in between the buildings ... we saw an SUV cross over, just put the pedal to the metal and just zooming full speed along the parade route. And then we heard a loud bang, and just deafening cries and screams from people who are struck by the vehicle," Angelito Tenorio, an alderman in nearby West Allis, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.Photos and videos of Waukesha circulating on Twitter showed police cars and ambulances crowding a street decked out with Christmas lights in the aftermath of the incident, which occurred around 4:39 p.m. (2239 GMT). People bundled up against the cold huddled on sidewalks as dusk fell.Some of the injured were taken to the hospital by ambulance, others by police and still more by family and friends, Thompson said.The Children's Wisconsin hospital said on Twitter it had received 15 patients as of 8 p.m., with no reported fatalities at that time.Schools would remain closed on Monday for grades 4K-12 and additional counselors would be available for students who may need support services, the district superintendent of schools said.In 2015, four people were killed and 46 injured in Stillwater, Oklahoma when a woman drove into a crowd watching the homecoming parade for a football team.A truck was deliberately driven into a Christmas market in Berlin, Germany in 2016, killing 12 people in an attack linked to Islamic State.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-least-20-injured-after-suv-plows-into-wisconsin-christmas-parade-101637545103182.html
22-11-2021||World||Taliban, in new 'religious guideline', asks TV channels to stop airing shows with women actors||Afghanistan's Taliban authorities on Sunday issued a new ''religious guideline'' that called on the country's television channels to stop showing dramas and soap operas featuring women actors.In the first such directive to Afghan media issued by the Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, the Taliban also called on women television journalists to wear Islamic hijabs while presenting their reports.And the ministry asked the channels not to air films or programmes in which the Prophet Mohammed or other revered figures are shown.It called for banning films or programmes that were against Islamic and Afghan values.''These are not rules but a religious guideline'," ministry spokesman Hakif Mohajir told AFP.The new directive was widely circulated late Sunday on social media networks.Despite insisting they will rule more moderately this time around, the Taliban have already introduced rules for what women can wear at university, and beaten and harassed several Afghan journalists despite promising to uphold press freedoms.The Taliban's guideline for TV networks comes after two decades of explosive growth for independent Afghan media under the Western-backed governments that ruled the country until August 15, when the Islamists regained power.Dozens of television channels and radio stations were set up with Western assistance and private investment soon after the Taliban were toppled in 2001.During the past 20 years, Afghan television channels offered a wide range of programmes -- from an ''American Idol'' style singing competition to music videos, along with several Turkish and Indian soap operas.When the Islamists previously ruled from 1996 to 2001, there was no Afghan media to speak of -- they banned television, movies and most other forms of entertainment, deeming it immoral.People caught watching television faced punishment, including having their set smashed. Ownership of a video player could lead to a public lashing.There was only one radio station, Voice of Sharia, that broadcast propaganda and Islamic programming.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-in-new-religious-guideline-asks-tv-channels-to-stop-airing-shows-with-women-actors-101637541964058.html

The crown prince denies any involvement."Do not sing for the murderers of my beloved Jamal," Cengiz wrote. "Please speak out and condemn his killer, Mohammed bin Salman. Your voice will be heard by millions."Bieber, who is Canadian, is among a group of artists scheduled to perform as Saudi Arabia hosts the Formula One Saudi Arabian Grand Prix in Jeddah."If you refuse to be a pawn of MBS, your message will be loud and clear: I do not perform for dictators. I choose justice and freedom over money," Cengiz wrote, using the crown prince's initials.Human rights groups have urged the performers to speak out against human rights issues in the kingdom."Saudi Arabia has a history of using celebrities and major international events to deflect scrutiny from its pervasive abuses," Human Rights Watch said on Wednesday.The advocacy group urged the performers, who also include rapper A$AP Rocky, DJs David Guetta and Tiesto and singer Jason Derulo, "to speak out publicly on rights issues or, when reputation-laundering is the primary purpose, not participate."Khashoggi, a Saudi-born U.S. resident who wrote opinion columns for the Washington Post critical of the Saudi crown prince, was killed and dismembered by a team of operatives linked to the prince in the kingdom's consulate in Istanbul. (Reporting by Kanishka Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Will Dunham)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dont-sing-for-murderers-jamal-khashoggi-s-fiancee-urges-justin-bieber-to-cancel-saudi-performance-101637541057147.html

22-11-2021||World||Ousted PM reinstated in Sudan||Sudan’s deposed prime minister signed a deal with the military on Sunday that will see him reinstated, almost a month after a military coup put him under house arrest. A key pro-democracy group that has mobilised dozens of protests had dismissed the deal as “a form of betrayal”.The country’s top general, Abdel Fattah Burhan, said in televised statements that Abdalla Hamdok will lead an independent technocratic Cabinet until elections can be held.It remains unclear how much power the government would hold. It would still remain under military oversight.It also remains unclear whether any political parties or pro-democracy groups have signed off on the agreement. The deal expects the military to release government officials and politicians arrested since the October 25 coup.Meanwhile, a 16-year-old boy was shot in the head and fatally wounded in the Sudanese capital on Sunday in a crackdown by security forces on anti-coup protests, medics said.The death raised to 41 the number of people killed since the October 25 coup, and it came hours after Hamdok was reinstated in a breakthrough deal to reverse the military takeover. “The signing of this deal opens the door wide enough to address all the challenges of the transitional period,” said Hamdok, speaking at the signing ceremony broadcast on state TV.The agreement comes just days after doctors said at least 15 people were killed by live fire during anti-coup demonstrations. Hamdok was held under house arrest by military leaders for weeks. The deal also stipulates that an investigation shall be conducted to identify those responsible for the killing and injuring of civilians and troops that marred protests following the coup.Hamdok thanked Sudan’s “regional and global friends” who helped in reaching this agreement but he did not name the countries.The 14-clause deal also stressed that power should be handed over to an elected civilian government after the end of the transitional period.“By signing this declaration, we could lay a genuine foundation to the transitional period,” said Burhan.The Sudanese Professionals’ Association, a group that played a key role in the uprising against Bashir, voiced their vehement opposition to the agreement, accusing Hamdok of committing “political suicide”.“This agreement only concerns its signatories and it is an unjust attempt to bestow legitimacy on the latest coup and the military council,” tweeted the group shortly after the deal was signed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ousted-pm-reinstated-in-sudan-101637531754658.html
22-11-2021||World||US lawmakers urge Katherine Tai to look for a deal during India visit||A bipartisan group of 75 US lawmakers have urged US Trade Representative (USTR) Katherine Tai to work towards a framework deal during her talks in New Delhi to quickly reinstate India’s benefits under an American preferential trade programme that allows tariff-free entry for imports from selective countries.But only if, they added, progress is made at the upcoming meeting of the Trade Policy Forum (TPF), the high platform for trade talks between the two sides, on the longstanding US demand for more access to Indian markets.The scheme - Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) - lapsed in December 2020; a replacement legislation to reform and modernise it is currently working its way through US Congress.But India’s benefits were suspended by the Trump administration much before in June 2019 after failing to get India grant US businesses to its markets.“If progress can be made at the TPF to address the market access issues that led to India’s termination as a GSP beneficiary, we strongly encourage you to create a framework for a deal that could be implemented soon after Congress reauthorises the GSP programme,” the lawmakers said in a joint letter to Katherine Tai.The letter was initiated by House of Representatives members Suzan DelBene, a Democrat, and Brad Westrup, a Republican. A total of more than 40 Democrats and 30 Republicans signed the letter.Tai meets her Indian counterpart union minister for commerce and industry Piyush Goyal on November 23. The TPF is meeting for the first time in four years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-lawmakers-urge-katherine-tai-to-look-for-a-deal-during-india-visit-101637519501127.html
22-11-2021||World||China downgrades diplomatic ties with Lithuania over Taiwan office opening||China on Sunday downgraded its diplomatic ties with Lithuania, expressing strong dissatisfaction with the Baltic state after Taiwan, which Beijing claims as a breakaway region, opened a de facto embassy in capital Vilnius.The Chinese foreign ministry also issued a “stern warning” to Taiwan, saying it is “never a country”.China views Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy, as its territory and opposes any kind diplomatic ties with a third country.On November 18, Lithuania, a nation of around 2.8 million people, brushed aside China’s protests, to allow Taipei to set up a “Taiwanese Representative Office in Lithuania” in Vilnius.“The Chinese side expresses its strong indignation and protest against this move, and decides to downgrade its diplomatic relations with Lithuania to the chargé d’affaires level,” the Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement on Sunday.“It has allowed the establishment in Lithuania of the “Representative Office” bearing the name of Taiwan, thus creating an egregious precedent in the world,” the statement added.Lithuania, according to agency reports from Vilnius, expressed regret over China’s move but defended its right to expand cooperation with Taiwan while respecting Beijing’s “One China” policy.The Chinese foreign ministry, meanwhile, also warned Taiwan, saying it belongs to China. “We also have this stern warning for the Taiwan authorities: Taiwan is never a country. No matter how “Taiwan independence” forces try to misrepresent facts and confound black and white, the historical fact that the mainland and Taiwan belong to one and the same China cannot be changed.”“Attempts to seek foreign support for political manipulation will prove a dead end,” the Chinese statement said.The downgrade is believed to be a deterrent to some other European countries, warning them not to try to provoke China on key issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-downgrades-diplomatic-ties-with-lithuania-over-taiwan-office-opening-101637502998533.html
22-11-2021||World||Upcoming India-US trade meet will set agenda for FTA: Nisha Biswal||Nisha Biswal, a former top US diplomat for India and head of the US-India Business Council, says that the upcoming meeting of the India-US Trade Policy Forum will set the framework for trade discussions on key areas of cooperation and alignment could create a path towards a Free Trade Agreement (FTA).Nisha Biswal also welcomed India’s willingness to negotiate an FTA. “Let me just welcome the much more positive and forward leaning stance that the Indian government has brought on the issue of free trade as someone who has been talking about the roadmap to an FTA for over a decade,” Biswal said in an interview. “There has never been in the past much of an appetite in India for an FTA certainly not with the United States, there was always a feeling that an FTA was going to disadvantage Indian companies and open up the Indian market too much to the US.”The trade policy forum, which is the top platform for India-US trade talks, will meet for the first time in four years this week when US trade representative (USTR) Katherine Tai is in New Delhi to meet commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal and other officials.Excerpts from the interview:So what’s going to happen now with Ambassador Tai in India next week?I believe that this will be the first trade policy forum in about four years. I think there was perhaps one at the very beginning of the Trump administration and then you know, we didn’t have one to do that. So, part of her focus from what I have been told in my conversations with USTR, really is to restart this process and to deepen kind of the institutional relationships and, you know, the frequency and the focus of these gatherings. And that’s a good thing.Where I would, perhaps challenge both governments and challenge trade representative Tai and minister Goyal is that process is important insofar as it advances goals and outcomes. And so, you’ve got also set some ambitious goals for where you want to go. What are the priority sectors? The Indian government has conveyed that it is open to the desirous of, you know, embarking on a (path) towards a Free Trade Agreement, which I think is a laudable goal and a worthy goal and unnecessary goal.You don’t appear too optimistic about deliverables and outcomes from this meeting.I don’t have an expectation. Do I think that both sides could have some important areas of an agreement that they could announce? I think that they could. I think a lot of work has been done over the years to try to come to some set of agreements around price controls on medical devices. A lot of work has been done on certain kinds of ICT (information and communications) tariffs. There are issues that the Indian government has raised that could be discussed, you know, I think, on GSP (Generalized System of Preferences), and, you know, I know that we don’t have an ability to reinstate GSP until Congress actually acts on it. Nonetheless, you know, there can be some conversations had there that would allow for certain understandings. So, I don’t preclude that there could be some things coming out of it. And we would welcome and encourage that. But what I’m saying is I don’t know that this is what either government wants to focus on. I think that what they want to do is get the framework right for how they’re going to take it forward.But why is a mini-deal not possible now? Can they not just pick up from where the Trump administration left off?I don’t think that there’s anything that precludes them from being able to get some kind of an outcome, right. A big chunk of the mini-deal hinged upon the restoration of GSP (President Donald Trump terminated India’s GSP benefits in 2019). GSP right now has lapsed as an entire programme has lapsed, right. So, it needs to be reauthorised by Congress. I think minus GSP it probably limits how much or what India is willing to put on the table in terms of what it gets back. So, the parameters of the mini-deal that existed are not currently in existence.But the more important thing will be for them to say, here are four areas that we know are priorities for our two governments to get right to harmonise and align our approaches and to create some opportunity. I think the digital economy is critically important. How are we going to address kind of the governance elements of a digital economy that is going to become more and more important for both countries. How are we dealing with emerging technology, whether it’s on 5G, whether it’s on AI, on semiconductors? How are we making sure that we are creating collaborative and aligned approaches to some of these areas that are going to shape the future economy for both of our countries and are going to be strategically important in the life sciences space. We have seen that US and India have been critically important to the world, you know, resolution of the Covid-19 pandemic, and India’s ability to create a vaccine supply chain is going to be really important to how the rest of the world survives and overcomes the pandemic. So, what do we need to address to facilitate that? Right. I think that there are a few areas that the two governments need to come together and say, “This is critically important, and we want to create a process for achieving greater harmonisation, alignment and convergence in these areas. And in so doing, it will create a much clearer path towards an FTA because we will have figured out what it takes for both sides to be able to achieve a more aligned approach that benefits both economies, both industries and workers in both countries.”You spoke about an FTA. That’s the new thing in the US trade relationship. And apparently, India’s very keen on it. You think it will come up at the meeting?Well, first of all, let me just welcome the much more positive and forward leaning stance that the Indian government has brought on the issue of free trade as someone who has been talking about the roadmap to an FTA for over a decade. There has never been in the past much of an appetite in India for an FTA certainly not with the United States, there was always a feeling that an FTA was going to disadvantage Indian companies and open up the Indian market too much to the US. Now, what I think India has understood is if it wants to be globally competitive, strategically and economically. It cannot exist as a silo. You cannot attract supply chains into India to manufacture for the world if you don’t have FTAs with most of the world, because you won’t be able to compete with producers in other countries that have huge FTAs. India does not have trade agreements with most of the major economies in the world. So, if you make in India, where are you exporting to?I just have one last question. And it is not trade related. It’s about s 400. What do you think is going to happen? You think the Biden’s administration could slap sanctions on India?I’m not privy to the thinking inside the administration. But I can tell you that we have been very clear and unequivocal that we think imposition of sanctions against one of our closest and most important partners would be counterproductive, would be not in our own national interest, and would get in the way of building and deepening the partnership between our two countries which is more important today than ever. So, we have said that we read that the deployment of the S-400 poses challenges and creates some concerns particularly around advanced US defence technology. And those concerns need to be addressed. But we also think that the US and India should be working behind doors to address those concerns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/upcoming-india-us-trade-meet-will-set-agenda-for-fta-nisha-biswal-101637478335587.html
