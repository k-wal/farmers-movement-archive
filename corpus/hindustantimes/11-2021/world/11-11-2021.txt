A High Court judge ruled in her favor in February, saying publication of the letter Meghan wrote to her father, Thomas Markle, was “manifestly excessive and hence unlawful.”Publisher Associated Newspapers is trying to overturn that decision at the Court of Appeal. The publisher argues that Meghan wrote the letter knowing it might be published, and made private information public by cooperating with Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand, authors of “Finding Freedom.”The duchess’ lawyers have previously denied that she or Harry collaborated with the authors. But the couple’s former communications director, Jason Knauf, said in evidence to the court that he gave the writers information, and discussed it with Harry and Meghan.In a witness statement, Knauf said the book was “discussed directly with the duchess multiple times in person and over email.” Emails released as part of Knauf’s statement showed he also emailed Harry to discuss the book and to say he would meet the authors.Knauf said Harry replied: “I totally agree that we have to be able to say we didn’t have anything to do with it. Equally, you giving the right context and background to them would help get some truths out there.”In a witness statement made public on Wednesday, Meghan accepted “that Mr. Knauf did provide some information to the authors for the book and that he did so with my knowledge, for a meeting that he planned for with the authors in his capacity as communications secretary.” She added that “the extent of the information he shared is unknown to me.”The duchess said she did not remember the discussions with Knauf when she gave evidence earlier in the case, “and I apologize to the court for the fact that I had not remembered these exchanges at the time.”“I had absolutely no wish or intention to mislead the defendant or the court,” she said.Associated Newspapers says Knauf’s evidence also undermines Meghan’s claim that she did not intend the letter to be seen by anyone but her father.In his witness statement, Knauf said the duchess “asked me to review the text of the letter, saying ‘obviously everything I have drafted is with the understanding that it could be leaked.’”Knauf said Meghan asked whether she should address her father in the letter as “Daddy,” adding that “in the unfortunate event that it leaked, it would pull at the heartstrings.”In her own written evidence, Meghan, 40, said she had not believed that her father “would sell or leak the letter, primarily because it would not put him in a good light.”“To be clear, I did not want any of it to be published, and wanted to ensure that the risk of it being manipulated or misleadingly edited was minimized, were it to be exploited,” she said.Lawyers for Meghan told the Court of Appeal Thursday that if she had wanted to put the letter to her father in the public domain, the “Finding Freedom” book would have been the “perfect opportunity” to do so.The appeal continues Thursday before three senior judges. A ruling is expected at a later date.Meghan, a former star of the American TV legal drama “Suits,” married Harry at Windsor Castle in May 2018.Meghan and Harry announced in early 2020 that they were quitting royal duties and moving to North America, citing what they said were the unbearable intrusions and racist attitudes of the British media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/meghan-markle-apologises-to-court-for-forgetting-book-discussions-says-no-intention-to-mislead-101636650013206.html

Sethi, founder of wearable devices brand Pavlok, hired a woman named Kara, for $8 an hour, to watch his screen and slap him if he went on the social media platform.Sethi’s peculiar act was advertised in Craigslist back in 2012 and has started doing the rounds on social media nine years later after Tesla CEO Elon Musk reacted to it using two ‘fire’ emojis, injecting new life into the stunt.“When I am wasting time, you’ll have to yell at me or if need be, slap me,” Sethi had written in the 2012 ad.Sethi reacted to Musk’s response with doubt, wondering if the ‘fire’ emojis symbolised his ‘Icarus flying too close to the sun moment. “I'm the guy in this picture. Is @elonmusk giving me two emojis the highest I'll ever reach? Is this my icarus flying too close to the sun moment? Was that implied by the fire symbols elon posted? Time will tell,” he tweeted on Wednesday.

This is the Marxism of contemporary China and of the 21st century. It embodies the best of Chinese culture and ethos in our times and represents a new breakthrough in adapting Marxism to the Chinese context.”The adoption of the resolution on Thursday coincided with Xi’s speech at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum where he spoke against forming cliques.In a recorded video to the forum, Xi urged Asian nations to resist forming “small circles on geopolitical grounds”, a reference to efforts by US President Joe Biden to counter China.“The Asia-Pacific region cannot and should not relapse into the antagonism and division of the Cold War era,” Xi said.Experts say that Xi is rewriting history to strengthen his grip on power. “He is using the resolution on history, which will be published at the end of the 6th plenum, to shape the narrative of the party’s history. Likely he will highlight the role of his father, an important figure of the Northwestern revolutionary base area, as well as his own role in realising an economically prosperous and geopolitically assertive China,” Victor Shih, expert on Chinese politics at University of California, San Diego, said.“For someone who grew up in the bosom of the party, telling the story according to his vision is important,” Shih said.The plenum heard and discussed a work report Xi delivered on behalf of the political bureau of the CPC central committee. He also explained the draft of the resolution to the session.It also reviewed and passed a resolution on convening the 20th National Congress of the CPC in the second half of 2022 in Beijing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-with-signature-cpc-resolution-xi-jinping-tightens-grip-on-power-101636632506691.html

11-11-2021||World||Uber sued in US for charging 'wait time fees' to people with disabilities||The United States Justice Department on Wednesday filed a lawsuit against the ride-hailing app Uber over allegations of overcharging passengers with disabilities. According to the statement published on the department's website, Uber Technologies charged "wait time" fees to passengers who needed more time to enter the car due to their disability. It has also asked the company to comply with the anti-discrimination law of America.In April 2016, Uber began charging passengers wait time fees in a number of cities, the department of justice stated in the lawsuit. Eventually, the company expanded the policy nationwide, it also said.The department said that the wait time policy of Uber violates the Americans with Disabilities Act, saying blind people or users of wheelchairs or walkers need more than two minutes to get into a car. "People with disabilities deserve equal access to all areas of community life, including the private transportation services provided by companies like Uber," Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke, who is representing the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, said in a statement.The lawsuit seeks to bring the company into compliance with the mandate of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), "while sending a powerful message that Uber cannot penalise passengers with disabilities simply because they need more time to get into a car," it also said.The department further asked Uber and other similar companies to ensure equal access for all people, "including those with disabilities". "People with disabilities deserve equal access to all areas of community life, including the private transportation services provided by companies like Uber," Clarke also said.The lawsuit is filed at US District Court in San Francisco and seeks an order to Uber to modify its wait time fee policy and pay monetary damages for any illegal fees that have been charged so far. Wait time fees start two minutes after the Uber car arrives at the pickup location and is charged until the car begins its trip.Meanwhile, the company has called the lawsuit "surprising and disappointing". "Wait time fees are charged to all riders to compensate drivers after two minutes of waiting, but were never intended for riders who are ready at their designated pickup location, but need more time to get into the car," it said in a statement, according to a report by Reuters.It also clarified that the company has issued refunds whenever disabled riders alerted about the charges on the app.In April, Uber was ordered to pay $1.1m to a blind woman who was refused rides on 14 occasions. In the lawsuit, it was alleged that Uber's drivers had illegally discriminated against her due to her condition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uber-sued-in-us-for-charging-wait-time-fees-to-people-with-disabilities-101636612230142.html

The framework agreement was announced by US climate envoy John Kerry and his Chinese counterpart Xie Zhenhua at the Glasgow UN climate conference (COP26). The world’s two biggest greenhouse gas emitters said they would take “enhanced climate actions” to meet the central goals of the 2015 Paris climate accord - limiting warming to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius beyond pre-industrial levels, and if possible, not to exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius.The agreement is titled he China-US Joint Glasgow Declaration on Enhancing Climate Action in the 2020s. “The two sides said they appreciated the work done so far and pledged to continue working together with all parties to strengthen the implementation of the Paris Agreement,” the Xinhua news agency reported on Thursday.“On the basis of the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities as well as taking into account national conditions, enhanced climate action will be taken to effectively address the climate crisis,” the Xinhua report said.UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres on Wednesday welcomed a China-US joint declaration on enhancing climate action at the Glasgow conference. “I welcome today’s agreement between China and the USA to work together to take more ambitious #ClimateAction in this decade,” Guterres tweeted. “Tackling the climate crisis requires international collaboration and solidarity, and this is an important step in the right direction.”Beijing and Washington have agreed to establish a working group on enhancing climate action in the 2020s to promote cooperation on climate change between the two countries and the multilateral processes.Chinese President Xi Jinping did not attend the UN meeting in person, delivering instead a written statement to the opening section of the summit when leaders usually give speeches.In it, he offered no additional pledges, while urging countries to keep their promises and “strengthen mutual trust and cooperation”.Xi pledged at the UN General Assembly in September that China would achieve carbon neutrality before 2060.Interestingly, the US and China had signed a climate deal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions during former president Barack Obama’s visit to China exactly seven years ago in November, 2014.US officials, according to Reuters, had then said the commitments by the world’s two biggest carbon polluters came after months of backroom negotiations and would set the stage for a global climate control pact, but experts said the limits did not break significant new ground.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cop26-us-china-unveil-surprise-deal-to-cooperate-more-on-climate-crisis-101636609404093.html
11-11-2021||World||SpaceX launch marks 600 space travelers in 60 years||A SpaceX rocket carried four astronauts into orbit Wednesday night, including the 600th person to reach space in 60 years.The repeatedly delayed flight occurred just two days after SpaceX brought four other astronauts home from the International Space Station. They should have been up there to welcome the newcomers, but Nasa and SpaceX decided to switch the order based on Monday’s ideal recovery weather in the Gulf of Mexico.“It was a great ride, better than we imagined,” mission commander Raja Chari said shortly after the spacecraft reached orbit.The launch was just as riveting for spectators at Nasa's Kennedy Space Center, as well as along the East Coast, as the Falcon rocket thundered through clouds on its way to space, turning night into day.Germany’s Matthias Maurer claimed the No 600 position, according to Nasa, based on his mission assignment. He and his three Nasa crewmates should arrive at the space station in under 24 hours, well over a week late.One of the astronauts — Nasa isn’t saying which one — was sidelined last week by an undisclosed medical issue. The crew member is fully recovered, according to Nasa. Officials won’t say whether it was an illness or injury but noted it wasn’t Covid-19.Bad weather also contributed to their flight delays. Chari said trying to launch on Halloween left them with "a trick instead of a treat.” It was also drizzling Wednesday night when the four astronauts said goodbye to their families for six months but it cleared up by launch time.“Enjoy your holidays among the stars. We’ll be waving as you fly by," SpaceX launch director Mark Soltys radioed to the crew.The list of 600 travelers ranges from those who have barely scratched space — like actor William Shatner last month — to US and Russian astronauts who have spent a year or more in orbit. This year’s surge in space tourists helped push the tally over the 600 mark.That averages out to 10 people per year since Yuri Gagarin’s pioneering flight in 1961, Maurer noted.“But I think in a very few years, we will see an exponential rise of that one because now we’re entering the era of commercial spaceflight,” he said after arriving at Kennedy Space Center two weeks ago.The crew launch marked SpaceX’s fourth for Nasa in 1 1/2 years and the company’s fifth passenger flight overall — including a September charter flight for four that skipped the space station. The Dragon capsule’s toilet leaked during their three days in orbit, necessitating a quick redesign of the flushing system in the newest capsule, named Endurance by its crew.A balky parachute during Monday's descent had SpaceX engineers poring over the data, before giving the go-ahead for Wednesday’s launch. One of the four chutes opened more than a minute late, a problem seen in testing and well within safety limits, SpaceX officials said.Mauer is one of three newbies on the crew. The 51-year-old was a finalist when he first applied to be an astronaut with the European Space Agency. Encouraged, he left his research job at a medical company and joined the space agency as an engineer, and made the astronaut cut in 2015.Chari, 44, is an Air Force colonel and the first space rookie in decades to lead a mission to orbit for Nasa. A test pilot from Cedar Falls, Iowa, Chari accumulated more than 2,500 hours in fighter jets, including combat missions in Iraq.Also on board:— Dr. Thomas Marshburn, 61, will be the oldest person to live aboard the space station and perform a spacewalk. Born in Statesville, North Carolina, he pursued a career in emergency medicine, then joined Nasa in 1994 as a flight surgeon. This is his third trip to the space station.— Kayla Barron, 34, a Navy lieutenant commander from Richland, Washington. She was among the first women to serve as submarine warfare officers. Added to the flight in May, she’s No. 601 in space.During their station stay, they will welcome two groups of tourists. A Russian film crew recently spent two weeks at the station, making a movie.The new crew will be joining three station residents — two Russians and Nasa's Mark Vande Hei, who celebrated his 55th birthday on Wednesday.“Nasa and @SpaceX are lighting a big candle in the sky for you tonight,” Nasa tweeted before the launch.That candle — the first-stage booster — landed upright on an ocean barge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spacex-launch-marks-600-space-travelers-in-60-years-101636606038906.html
11-11-2021||World||Taliban must cut off umbilical cord with Pak for Afghanistan to survive||After a day-long deliberations on Afghanistan by National Security Advisors (NSAs) of eight neighboring countries here on Wednesday, it has become quite evident that the Taliban will continue to hold the reins of power in Kabul. It has also become clear that apart from Afghan people themselves or any rival Sunni Salafists like the Islamic State of Khorasan Province (ISKP) or al Qaida, no one can remove the Taliban from power as global powers neither have the intentions, energy nor the mind space to tackle humongous problems of Afghanistan.Now that the global community has mentally accepted the Taliban regime in Kabul, it is time that the Sunni Pashtun force came out of the shadows and started governing the Islamic Emirates of Afghanistan in the earnest and not wait for acceptance in UN. Since the Taliban occupied Kabul on August 15, its Supreme leader Mullah Haibatullah Akundzada has only been heard not seen, giving rise to the very physical existence of the cleric. According to Kabul watchers, none could confirm the physical presence of the Emir-ul-Momim when he was said to have made his first public appearance in Kandahar on October 31. He was perhaps last seen at the Pakistan Army cantonment in Karachi earlier this year.While secrecy surround Mullah Akhundzada in Afghanistan, there are reports that Pakistan deep state backed Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani frequently moves to and fro on Durand Line even as he contests with Defence Minister Mullah Yaqoob, son of first Emir-ul-Momin Mullah Omar, for political power in Kabul. The Taliban may be good in wielding the gun and asymmetric warfare, but governance is definitely not their forte as the country moves towards virtual ventilator state.If the Taliban have real desire to provide governance even under the Islamic Sharia law to Afghanistan, then the answer lies within the country and not across in the ISI Headquarters in Rawalpindi. With Taliban’s acting Foreign Minister Mullah Amir Khan Muttaqi in Islamabad today for first bilateral talks with Pakistan after seizing power and the ISI chief making frequent trips to Kabul as it was just another intelligence station, the beginning is surely not good but on expected lines.Even though Pakistan ISI is gloating over its success in making the mighty US run away empty-handed from Kabul, it is only a matter of time that the chaos spill across the Durand Line. It is said that Taliban Deputy Prime Minister Mullah Baradar told the ISI chief Gen Faiz Hameed that if Islamic Emirates is good for Afghanistan, the same holds good for Pakistan. The threat in Barader’s statement is understood by Pakistan Army but not by the civilian leadership in Islamabad. For a country where retail sugar is more costly than petrol, the chances of sustaining a neighboring perpetually strife torn country are simply non-existent. It is only a matter of time when Pakistan gets dragged down by its own creation.Rather than let Pakistan practice its dark arts in Kabul, the Taliban should cut the umbilical cord from Rawalpindi and seek legitimacy from the Loya Jirga (Tribal Council) and the Ulema Council (Religious Council) of Afghanistan for internal peace in the country. Legitimacy from the people of Afghanistan will not only bring stability to the nation that has not seen peace in many a decade but also respect and acceptance from the international community. Taliban must make a transition from a terrorist group to a political ruler if Afghanistan has to survive. Or else a weak vulnerable state with actual reins of power across the Durand Line will give way to opportunistic Islamic jihadist groups, which are present on an industrial scale in Pakistan. Given their Islamic duty to spread jihad in non-Muslim lands, these Islamist Takfiri (who have no qualms in killing fellow Muslims) groups in a matter of time will start targeting a third country in the west with or without the knowledge of the Taliban, leading to another cycle of occupation, total chaos and violence. The tragedy is that Taliban leadership can always take shelter across the Khyber and Spin Boldak passes as in the past, but the hapless people of Afghanistan have nowhere to go.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-must-cut-of-umbilical-cord-with-pak-for-afghanistan-to-survive-101636603944269.html

They are in the prisons,” Hamraz added.Also Read| Taliban minister Muttaqi in Islamabad for talks as Pak hosts meet on AfghanistanSince the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan in August this year, the Islamic State has claimed responsibility for a series of attacks in the war-ravaged country.The latest attack by the terror outfit was on November 2 when its fighters attacked a military hospital in the capital city of Kabul, killing 25 people and injuring over 50.

11-11-2021||World||Brazilian Prez Jair Bolsonaro to join centrist party, eyeing 2022 reelection bid||After two years without a political party, Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro sealed an agreement with the centrist Liberal Party to back his 2022 reelection bid, according to a party statement released Wednesday.The decision followed a meeting between Bolsonaro and Liberal Party leader Valdemar Costa Neto in the capital Brasilia, the statement said. The president's formal enrollment to the party's ranks will take place Nov. 22.Bolsonaro intends for the alliance to aid him in battling his nemesis, former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. “Lula,” as da Silva is known universally, holds a handsome lead over Bolsonaro in early polls. Joining one of the parties that forms part of the so-called Centrao group also signals Bolsonaro shifting course from his 2018 campaign strategy, when he sharply criticized their old-school political practices.“It is very symbolic how Bolsonaro has started to play the traditional game of Brazilian politics," said Maurício Santoro, a political science professor at the State University of Rio de Janeiro. “The PL is helping Bolsonaro survive.”The Liberal Party - known by its Portuguese initials PL - and other Centrao parties are notorious for their ideological malleability and swapping support for government appointments and earmarks. Bolsonaro was affiliated with such parties during most of his seven terms as a federal lawmaker, but cast himself as a political outsider during his 2018 presidential campaign. He vowed not to embrace the horse trading that benefited entrenched actors and enabled corruption.Instead, he ran under the banner of the Social Liberal Party, which he left one year after his election victory amid disagreements with party leadership over funding and regional nominations. He set out to forge his own party, but failed to garner enough signatures and has been without a political home since.Two of Bolsonaro’s ministers told The Associated Press the president’s decision to join the PL was influenced by his three politician sons, who believe the party will grant their father sufficient autonomy to pick allies as candidates for gubernatorial and congressional positions in next year’s election. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly.The presidential press office didn't respond to a request for comment from the AP confirming the PL's statement, nor the president's justification for the decision. Earlier Wednesday, Bolsonaro said in a radio interview there was a “99.9% chance” he would join the PL.Reports that Bolsonaro was seeking a Centrao party to sponsor his reelection bid had already generated commentary from analysts that he was fully departing from his prior anti-establishment stance. As rumors of his agreement with the PL intensified this week, a series of comments criticizing party leader Costa Neto were deleted from the social media profiles of Bolsonaro family members.Bolsonaro himself has said Costa Neto was corrupt and a convict, noted Carlos Melo, a political analyst and professor at Insper University in Sao Paulo. In 2012, Costa Neto, then a lawmaker, was convicted for corruption and money laundering in a vast vote-buying scandal that almost brought down da Silva’s administration. He served time in prison.“Bolsonaro was always affiliated with a Centrao party, his whole congressional career," Melo said. “He got elected criticizing the Centrao, the Workers' Party, the Brazilian Social Democracy Party, saying he was an outsider. It was a strategy for that election.”Bolsonaro joining the PL will mark the continuation of his cozying up to the Centrao over the past year. The far-right president has turned to the Centrao for political shelter from increasing pressure on his administration, including more than 100 impeachment requests, a Senate investigation into his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic and plunging popularity.

Intermittent rain and clouds over the Cape earlier in the day had cast doubt on launch prospects, but the weather cleared sufficiently by flight time, Nasa said.Live Nasa video footage showed the four crew members strapped into the pressurized cabin of their gleaming white SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, wearing their helmeted white and black flight suits in the final minutes before launch.The three American astronauts and their European Space Agency crewmate were due to arrive at the space station, orbiting some 250 miles (400km) above the Earth, on Thursday evening following a flight of about 22 hours.The flight marks the third “operational” space station crew sent to orbit aboard a Dragon capsule since Nasa and SpaceX teamed up to resume space launches from American soil last year, following a nine-year hiatus at the end of the US space shuttle program in 2011.“Crew 3” includes two members of Nasa's latest graduating class of astronauts - Raja Chari, 44, a US Air Force combat jet and test pilot serving as mission commander, and mission specialist Kayla Barron, 34, a US Navy submarine officer and nuclear engineer.The team's designated pilot and second-in-command is veteran astronaut Tom Marshburn, 61, a medical doctor and former Nasa flight surgeon who has logged two previous spaceflights to the space station and four spacewalks. Rounding out the crew is European Space Agency (ESA) astronaut Matthias Maurer, 51, of Germany, a materials science engineer.Chari, Barron, and Maurer were making their debut spaceflights with Wednesday's launch, becoming the 599th, 600th, and 601st humans in space.Both Chari and Barron also are among the first group of 18 astronauts selected for NASA's upcoming Artemis missions, aimed at returning humans to the moon later this decade, over a half-century after the Apollo lunar program ended.Nasa-SpaceX partnershipIt is the fourth crewed flight overall in 17 months under Nasa's public-private partnership with SpaceX, the rocket company founded in 2002 by Musk, the billionaire chief executive of electric car maker Tesla IncThe first was a two-astronaut trial run to the space station in May 2020, followed by the maiden Nasa-SpaceX operational “Crew 1” in November of that year.“Crew 2” was launched to the space station in April of this year, and just returned safely to Earth on Monday night with a splashdown capping a record 199 days in orbit.The latest mission also follows a flurry of recent high-profile astro-tourism flights, including the SpaceX launch in September of “Inspiration 4”, the first all-civilian crew sent to orbit without a professional astronaut on board.Earlier this month, 90-year-old actor William Shatner, famed for playing Captain James T Kirk on the original 1960s “Star Trek” TV series, made headlines riding aboard a rocketship launched by billionaire Jeff Bezos's company Blue Origin to become the oldest person to fly in space.The “Crew 3” team, on arriving at the space station, will be welcomed aboard the orbiting laboratory by its three current occupants – two cosmonauts from Russia and Belarus and a US astronaut who shared a Soyuz flight to orbit with them earlier this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasa-spacex-launch-crew-3-astronauts-on-flight-to-international-space-station-101636596425066.html

A date has not been announced for the Xi-Biden meeting but a person briefed on the matter said it was expected to be as soon as next week.Stakes for the meeting are high - Washington and Beijing have been sparring on issues from the origins of the pandemic to China’s expanding nuclear arsenal - but Biden’s team has so far set low expectations for specific outcomes.This came even as China reacted with fury on Wednesday to a visit by a delegation of US lawmakers to Taiwan.China claims self-ruled Taiwan as its territory. Taiwan’s foreign ministry confirmed the visit was arranged by the American Institute in Taiwan - Washington’s de facto embassy on the island - and said it would provide “necessary administrative assistance”.Beijing responded by saying the “risky and provocative actions” are “doomed to end in failure”. “Colluding with Taiwan independence forces is a dangerous game and playing with fire will result in burning themselves,” said foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin at a press briefing, calling the visit a “clumsy performance”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-ready-to-work-with-us-to-manage-differences-101636592112346.html

This is the fist visit of Afghan officials to Pakistan since the Sunni Pashtun group swept to power in Kabul.The Pakistan foreign ministry said that during the three-day visit, the focus will be on bilateral ties, with discussions to be held on enhancing trade, cross-border movement, land and aviation links, people-to-people contacts and regional connectivity. Muttaqi will also hold talks with Pakistani counterpart Shah Mahmood Qureshi.The visit is taking place as a follow-up to Qureshi's visit to Kabul on October 21.It comes at a time when Pakistan is holding the Troika Plus meeting on Afghanistan with special representatives from China, Russia and the United States. The meeting is scheduled to be held on Thursday and Muttaqi is expected to meet the special representatives of these nations.The 20-member delegation being led by Muttaqi includes minister for finance Hidayatullah Badri, minister for industries and trade Nooruddin Aziz and senior officials from the aviation ministry.Pakistan has been trying to convince the world to diplomatically engage with the Taliban since they seized power in Afghanistan on August 15. However, no country has officially recognised the government in Afghanistan.At a meeting of top security officials held in India on Wednesday, discussions were held on the evolving situation in Afghanistan, especially the security situation and its regional and its global ramifications. The meeting was chaired by National Securoty Advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval and attended by NSAs and secretaries of security councils of seven countries - Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan besides Russia and Iran.They later released a consensus statement, which emphasised on maintaining the territorial integrity of Afghanistan and was against interference from outside powers - a clear message to Pakistan - and called for a collective cooperation against the menace of radicalisation and extremism in the region. The NSAs also suggested to the Taliban that Afghanistan should have an independent and an inclusive regime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-minister-muttaqi-in-islamabad-for-talks-as-pak-hosts-meet-on-afghanistan-101636589607792.html
11-11-2021||World||Astronauts suit up for planned SpaceX mission to International Space Station||The latest team of astronauts bound for the International Space Station, three from Nasa and a German crewmate, suited up for a planned liftoff atop a SpaceX rocket on Wednesday, despite rain and clouds at the Florida launch site that forecasters predicted would clear in time.The SpaceX-built launch vehicle, consisting of a Crew Dragon capsule perched atop a two-stage Falcon 9 rocket, was set for liftoff at 9:03pm. (0200 GMT on Thursday) from Nasa's Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral in Florida.LIVE: Four astronauts are launching to the @Space_Station on @SpaceX's Crew Dragon!Our #Crew3 mission is scheduled to lift off from @NASAKennedy at 9:03pm ET (02:03 UTC Nov. 11). Watch with us and send your #askNASA questions: https://t.co/KZST234MYEIf all goes smoothly, the three US astronauts and a European Space Agency (ESA) astronaut will arrive about 22 hours later and dock with the space station 250 miles (400 km) above the Earth to begin a six-month science mission aboard the orbiting laboratory.Intermittent showers and heavy clouds over the Cape on Wednesday cast renewed doubt on prospects for the launch proceeding as planned, although Nasa said its latest forecasts called for a 70 per cent chance of favorable weather conditions for liftoff. Commentators for NASA's live webcast of pre-launch activities said the weather was expected to clear sufficiently by launch time.A string of weather delays has confounded the mission since its original launch window on October 31. One postponement earlier this month was attributed to an astronaut's unspecified medical issue, which has since been resolved.Joining the SpaceX mission's Nasa astronauts – flight commander Raja Chari, 44, mission pilot Tom Marshburn, 61, and mission specialist Kayla Barron, 34 – is German astronaut Matthias Maurer, 51, an ESA mission specialist.After donning their helmeted white and black flight suits for the final checkout, they strolled out of the space center's operations building, waving to cheering loved ones and well-wishers. They were then escorted by assistants under umbrellas to three cars waiting to take them to the launchpad to board the Dragon capsule, dubbed Endurance.Chari, a US Air Force combat jet and test pilot, Barron, a US Navy submarine officer and nuclear engineer, and Maurer, a materials science engineer, are all making their debut spaceflights on the mission. The three rookies will become the 599th, 600th, and 601st humans in space, according to SpaceX.Both Chari and Barron were also among the first group of 18 astronauts selected last year for Nasa's upcoming Artemis missions to the moon.Marshburn, a physician and former Nasa flight surgeon, is the most experienced astronaut of the crew, having logged two previous spaceflights and four spacewalks. He was part of a 13-member team that helped assemble the space station in 2009 and returned to the orbiting outpost in a 2012-2013 mission.‘Crew 3’Wednesday's liftoff, if successful, would count as the fifth human spaceflight SpaceX has achieved to date, following its "Inspiration 4" launch in September that sent an all-civilian crew to orbit for the first time.The latest mission would mark the fourth crew Nasa has launched to orbit aboard a SpaceX vehicle in 17 months, building on a public-private partnership with the rocket company formed in 2002 by billionaire Elon Musk, also the founder of electric car maker Tesla Inc.Their collaboration helped usher in a new era for Nasa leading to last year's first launch of American astronauts from US soil in nine years, since it quit flying space shuttles in 2011.The team set for blastoff on Wednesday has been designated "Crew 3" - the third full-fledged "operational" crew Nasa and SpaceX have flown to the space station after a two-astronaut trial run in May 2020.The four astronauts of "Crew 2" safely returned to Earth late on Monday from a record 199 days in orbit, splashing down in the Gulf of Mexico off Florida after an eight-hour voyage home from the space station.The latest mission also follows a flurry of recent high-profile astro-tourism flights. In July, two SpaceX rivals – Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic Holding Inc – launched back-to-back flights with their respective billionaire founders, Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson, riding along.Last month, 90-year-old actor William Shatner, famed for playing Captain James T Kirk in the original 1960s “Star Trek” TV series, rode aboard a Blue Origin rocket to become the oldest person to fly in space.Crew 3 will be welcomed aboard the space station by its three current occupants - two cosmonauts from Russia and Belarus and a US astronaut who shared a Soyuz flight to the orbiting platform earlier this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astronauts-suit-up-for-planned-spacex-mission-to-international-space-station-101636587382145.html

11-11-2021||World||No shortage of differences, but only one way for climate cooperation: US, China in joint statement||China and the U.S. vowed to work together to slow global warming, issuing a surprise joint statement Wednesday that injects new momentum into the last days of global climate negotiations. The deal also marks a rare moment of cooperation between superpowers locked in geopolitical rivalry and who seemed at odds for most of the two-week talks in Glasgow, Scotland.The two sides agreed to boost their efforts to cut emissions, including by tackling methane and illegal deforestation, China’s special climate envoy Xie Zhenhua told reporters.  They will establish a working group to increase action in the 2020s — a key decade — which will meet in the first half of next year. His U.S. counterpart John Kerry said that the group will focus on “concrete” measures.As the world’s two major economies, “we need to work actively to address climate change,” Xi said. Kerry said that 'the U.S. and China have no shortage of differences, but on climate cooperation is the only way to get this job done.' The two spoke at separate press conferences, one after the other, with Xie going first. The announcement changed the mood in Glasgow, where negotiators are in the midst of fraught discussions over how to accelerate measures to curb the rise in global temperatures. It was a bilateral agreement between the U.S. and China that paved the way for the landmark Paris Agreement in 2015.'The big significance of this is geopolitical,” said Nick Mabey, co-founder of think tank E3G. “The U.S. and China have signaled they will end the wars of words that marred the past days.”The two countries reaffirmed the temperature goals of the Paris accord, which has a stretch target of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, and recognized there is a gap between current policies and what needs to be done, Xie said. Both are committed to pushing for a successful COP26, including agreements on climate finance and rules to create a global carbon market, he said.Still, China declined to join the global pledge being pushed by the U.S. and the European Union to cut methane emissions 30% by the end of the decade from 2020 levels. Xie said China will develop its own national plan. Kerry admitted that he had failed to get China to move its deadline for reaching peak emissions earlier from 2030. “We've peaked out on peaking,” he said. As the world’s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, China can do more than any other country right now to help the world avoid the worst effects of global warming. But it argues that its plan to reach carbon neutrality by 2060 will already be the most ambitious emissions reduction ever attempted. The joint agreement comes ahead of a virtual summit likely to be held next week between Chinese President Xi Jinping — who skipped an in-person appearance at COP26 — and U.S. President Joe Biden. The leaders have held two phone calls alongside various lower-level meetings that the U.S. said were disappointing and lacked serious engagement from Chinese officials.The aim of the meeting is likely to be simply putting a floor under tensions over everything from tech to trade, human rights and the status of Taiwan. Xi wrote in a letter this week to the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations that China is ready to deepen ties with the U.S. and better manage their disputes. Both leaders have an incentive to put the relationship on a more even footing as they each focus on challenges at home, and climate matters are one of the few areas they can cooperate on. But the longer-term trajectory is still toward a collision between the world's two biggest economies as they jostle for both economic and strategic influence around the world.  “It can only be good news that the U.S. and China are working closely on climate change and slashing methane emissions,” said Bernice Lee, research director at Chatham House. “But the statement is not enough to close the deal. The real test of Washington and Beijing is how hard they push for a 1.5°C-aligned deal here in Glasgow.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-shortage-of-differences-but-only-one-way-for-climate-cooperation-us-china-in-joint-statement-101636573880529.html

A bulletin issued last night stated that the seriousness of his general condition had increased.Kemal Ataturk's adopted daughter and his sister were keeping constant watch in a near by room. There was grace concern among the entire Turkish people. Police patrols were strongly reinforced and precautionary measures taken.The Prime Minister, Bay Celal Bayar, arrived at the Palace yesterday evening, following an all night journey from Ankara.Kemal Ataturk had been very seriously ill nearly a fortnight back but he made a marvelous recovery and was considered to be out of danger. The illness, however, took a sudden turn for the worse two days back, and the end was not long in coming.It is officially announced that Kemal Ataturk died at 07-05 (G.M.T.). Under the constitution, the President of the National Assembly, Abdul Halikrenda, automatically assumed interim Presidency until a new President is elected.The National Assembly is meeting at -Ankara at 11 a.m. tomorrow in order to proceed immediately with the election. The most likely successor to the Presidency is General Ismet Ineunu, the 58-year-old ex-Premier, who has taken no part in public life since he resigned the Premiership last October. He collaborated closely with Kemal Ataturk for 13 years.Kemal Ataturk or Ghazi Mustafa Kemal Pasha, as he was known earlier, was born in 1878 in comparatively modest circumstances in Salonika. His father was a customs officer who afterwards entered the timber trade and died when Mustafa was yet a small child. The boy was brought up and educated by his mother, a women at character and ability. He completed his primary education in Salonika and entered a secondary school in the same place; but, having been maltreated by his Arabic teacher he left school, against his family's wish and secretly entered the military preparatory school. There he proved to be an exceptional student, specially in mathematics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ht-this-day-nov-1938-maker-of-modern-turkey-dead-101636567284254.html
11-11-2021||World||US announces launch of global Covid-19 tracker portal||The US on Wednesday announced the launch of a publicly accessible and comprehensive global tracker of progress on battling Covid-19 - from hospitalisation to vaccination rates to vaccine donations pledged and delivered - to bring transparency and accountability to the fight.Accessible at covid19globaltracker.org, the site will be run by the WHO, WTO, IMF and the World Bank Group.“It will help provide two critical elements for stopping the pandemic - transparency, because we need a centralised source of data to stay ahead of Covid and accountability, because we all need to follow through on our commitments,” US secretary of state Antony Blinken said, announcing the launch of the tracker, at a global meeting of foreign ministers on Covid-19.India was represented by foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla at the meet, which was held virtually.The tracker, which has gone live, says is goal it to measure progress towards the global targets for access to Covid-19 vaccines, treatments, tests, PPEs, other tools, and delivery of donor pledges. The listed targets were based on targets identified by the WHO’s ACT (Access to Covid-19 Tools) - A Strategic Plan & Budget, the Multilateral Leaders Task Force (comprising the IMF, WHO, WTO and the World Bank Group), the IMF’s Pandemic Proposal, and the Covid-19 summit hosted by US President Joe Biden in September, which was attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other world leaders.Public health officials and experts around the world have pointed to the lack of transparency and accountability as a key driver of the pandemic from its start in China in November 2019 to its spread to every corner of the world, killing 5.08 million people.Blinken also announced a public-private partnership to support countries vaccinate their people. “Leading private sector companies will work pro bono to share their expertise and capabilities to support vaccination campaigns, taking on issues like managing supply chains and helping optimise vaccine sites to deliver shots as quickly and safely as possible,” he said.The third, and final, announcement Blinken made was about vaccinating people in regions and areas not accessible by governments, such as conflict zones. “I’m pleased to share that the United States has helped broker a deal between J&J and Covax (the WHO-run global effort towards equitable distribution of Covid-19 vaccines) to facilitate the first delivery of J&J vaccines to people living in conflict zones and other humanitarian settings.”This was the first meeting of foreign ministers on Covid-19, the secretary of state had pointed at the start of the ministerial, and the need for it was felt as one of the key learnings of dealing with the pandemic was that it cannot be left to only public health officials and experts.“This pandemic has taught us that preventing and responding to global health emergencies cannot be the responsibility only of health ministers or global health experts because a pandemic isn’t just a health crisis. It’s also a security crisis and economic crisis, a humanitarian crisis,” Blinken said, adding that he hoped several more would follow as part of an ongoing discussion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-announces-launch-of-global-covid-19-tracker-portal-101636564583316.html
11-11-2021||World||Dialogue with Dalai Lama only about his future, not about Tibet: China||China on Wednesday said it was ready for dialogue with Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama but it would only be about his future and not about Tibet.The Chinese foreign ministry said the 14th Dalai Lama should stop activities aimed at splitting China and stop plotting and inciting violence.The ministry was responding to a question on the Dalai Lama telling an online forum that he had no particular plan to meet President Xi Jinping and whether Beijing was willing to resume dialogue with the Tibetan government-in-exile.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin called the government-in-exile an “out and out separatist political group”.“The so-called Tibetan government-in-exile is an out and out separatist political group. It is against China’s constitution and laws, it is an illegal organisation. No country in the world recognises it,” Wang said on Wednesday.“The central government in China, on engaging and discussing issues with the 14th Dalai Lama, the position is consistent and clear. The door to dialogue and engagement is open,” he said, before clarifying: “I would like to stress that the only matter that can be discussed is the future of the Dalai Lama himself, not to do anything with Tibet”.“What the Dalai Lama should do is to stop secessionist activities and take concrete measures to win the trust of the central government and the Chinese people,” Wang added.Speaking at an online forum, hosted in Tokyo, Dalai Lama, 86, on Wednesday criticised the leaders of China saying they “don’t understand the variety of different cultures” there and that there is too much control by the main Han ethnic group.A Reuters report from Tokyo quoted him as saying that he had nothing against “Chinese brothers and sisters” as fellow humans and he broadly supported the ideas behind Communism and Marxism.“Though the Dalai Lama said he had no plan to meet China’s leader, Xi Jinping, he said he would like to visit again to see old friends since ‘I am growing older’ - but would avoid Taiwan since relations between it and China are ‘quite delicate’,” the Reuters report said.“I prefer to remain here in India, peacefully,” he said.Wang’s mention about the Dalai Lama’s future comes in the backdrop of the issue of his succession.In May, China said it would choose the successor to the Dalai Lama through “drawing lots from the golden urn” with the candidate subject to the approval of the Communist Party China (CPC)-ruled central government.Citing historical precedence, a government policy paper on Tibet said the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama and other grand Living Buddhas have been subjected to approval by the central government since an ordinance passed during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911).The Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 via northeastern India following a Chinese crackdown on an uprising by the local population in Tibet.The Tibetan leader was granted political asylum in India and the Tibetan government-in-exile has been based in Dharamshala in Himachal Pradesh since then.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dialogue-with-dalai-lama-only-about-his-future-not-about-tibet-china-101636543820288.html
11-11-2021||World||Canada’s NDP leader denies in talks with Trudeau for a coalition government||Canada’s New Democratic Party (NDP) leader Jagmeet Singh on Tuesday denied that he is discussing a potential coalition government along with Prime Minister and Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau.While speculations of a deal between the two parties have been ongoing after Trudeau failed to secure a majority in the September general elections, Singh refuted those rumours.“There is no discussion at all of a coalition and that is a firm no for me. There’s not going to be any coalition at all,” the NDP leader said in Ottawa on Tuesday, according to the outlet National Post.However, he added, “We are prepared to make parliament work for Canadians.”Trudeau announced the full cabinet last month but the two parties have been in negotiations about an arrangement prior to parliament reconvening on November 22.Multiple media outlets have reported that they could agree to a “confidence and supply” deal, which would mean support from the NDP foe Liberal legislation in exchange for a minimum common agenda.Trudeau called snap elections in Canada on August 15, with the objective of securing a majority. However, his gamble to turning the minority into a majority failed when his party only secured 160 seats in the House of Commons in the elections, falling short by 10 seats. It will need outside support from other parties to pass bills.For the NDP, the outcome was similarly disappointing: it secured only 25 seats, gaining only one additional seat in the elections. Previously, when Trudeau ran his minority Government between 2019 and this year, the NDP often extended support to legislations, particularly when it came to Covid-19 benefits packages. However, there was no formal or informal arrangement between the two parties. That could change as talk continue.The possibility of an arrangement has attracted the criticism from the principal opposition party, the Conservatives. “The Liberals are planning to form a coalition with the NDP that will be a disaster for our economy. They’re united in the same high-tax, high-spending agenda,” Conservative Party leader Erin O’Toole said on Twitter on Tuesday.NDP is the fourth-largest caucus in the House after the ruling party, the Conservatives and Bloc Quebecois.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadas-ndp-leader-denies-in-talks-with-trudeau-for-a-coalition-government-101636533499570.html
11-11-2021||World||China strengthens LAC facilities for soldiers before winter||China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has strengthened facilities for its soldiers along the disputed border with India, ahead of winter, in anticipation of “small frictions”, a state media report said on Wednesday.Observers told state-run tabloid Global Times that although “large-scale clashes are unlikely to occur in winter, small frictions may happen from time to time” along the Sino-India border, making it necessary for the PLA to be ready.Indian and Chinese militaries have been locked in a border standoff in eastern Ladakh since May last year when a violent clash in Pangong lake area led to both sides gradually deploying tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry along the border. Several rounds of military and diplomatic talks have only resulted in partial disengagement of troops until now.Keeping in mind the possibility of a clash between India and China and the harsh winter conditions along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the PLA has been focussing on streamlining the logistic supply lines, the report said. Other reports in China’s official military outlets also reported recently on the improvement of living conditions along the LAC so that PLA troops can remain stationed for prolonged periods at high altitudes during the winter, especially when temperatures drop sharply to well below zero.Last week, the PLA Daily reported that personnel assigned to a brigade under the PLA Xinjiang Military Command, which carried out training on the snow-capped plateau at an elevation of 5,300 metres, have received new types of tactical vests.“The materials used for the vest can resist strong wind and keep the soldiers warm in freezing conditions, and the embedded quick-slip device enables the soldiers to quickly escape from danger at critical moments,” the report said.Another PLA Daily report said a type of balanced-air-pressure chamber for oxygen therapy was put into use for troops under the Hotan military sub-command of the PLA Xinjiang Military Command in mid-October.Portable oxygenators, oxygen chambers and individual oxygen supply devices have also been deployed for frontline troops.According to the Global Times report, “barracks on the high-altitude plateau are operated and heated with multiple energy sources such as coal, electricity and solar power”. A PLA border regiment commander quoted in the report said that all outposts are connected to the state power grid and have communication base stations.Separately, the PLA has also revealed that it conducted multiple drills on its western plateau over the past week.An artillery regiment, affiliated with the PLA Xinjiang Military Command, recently conducted a comprehensive, cross-day-and-night exercise in a high-altitude region, involving live-fire shooting of PCL-181 155mm self-propelled howitzers and PHL-11 122mm multiple rocket launchers. The drill tested the troops’ fire strike efficiency and combat capabilities under the harsh cold in plateau regions, China Central Television (CCTV) reported on Saturday.In September, Chinese official media announced that both Xinjiang and Tibet, bordering India, will soon have 30 airports at the disposal of the Western Theatre Command (WTC) to facilitate the movement of PLA personnel.The WTC is the largest military command of the PLA and oversees the disputed border with India. While some of these airports have been built and are functional, the remaining are under construction.Among the three new airports to be built in the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) are those at Lhunze county, Tingri county and Burang county, close to the border with India, official media had reported earlier this year.The opening of new routes and rapid construction of new airports come in the backdrop of the ongoing Sino-India border tension in eastern Ladakh.China is bolstering its presence all along the border with India, fortifying the remote regions by building critical civil-military dual use infrastructure like airports and railway routes.Former director general of military operations Lt Gen Vinod Bhatia (retd) said, “As long as the standoff continues and additional forces are deployed on both sides, the possibility of localised flare ups cannot be ruled out. Both armies are prepared for that, although there has been no escalation or flare up after the June 2020 Galwan Valley skirmish.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-pla-strengthens-facilities-at-lac-in-anticipation-of-small-frictions-101636530741401.html
