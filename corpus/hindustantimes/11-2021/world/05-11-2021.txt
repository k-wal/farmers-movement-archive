Mirza Ali Ahmadi and his wife Suraya found themselves and their five children on Aug. 19 in a chaotic crowd outside the gates of the Kabul airport in Afghanistan when a US soldier, from over the tall fence, asked if they needed help.Fearing their two-month old baby Sohail would get crushed in the melee, they handed him to the soldier, thinking they would soon get to the entrance, which was only about 16 feet (5 meters) away.But at that moment, Mirza Ali said, the Taliban - which had swiftly taken over the country as US troops withdrew - began pushing back hundreds of hopeful evacuees. It took the rest of the family more than a half hour to get to the other side of the airport fence.Once they were inside, Sohail was nowhere to be found.Mirza Ali, who said he worked as a security guard at the US embassy for 10 years, began desperately asking every official he encountered about his baby's whereabouts. He said a military commander told him the airport was too dangerous for a baby and that he might have been taken to a special area for children. But when they got there it was empty."He walked with me all around the airport to search everywhere," Mirza Ali said in an interview through a translator. He said he never got the commander's name, as he didn't speak English and was relying on Afghan colleagues from the embassy to help communicate. Three days went by."I spoke to maybe more than 20 people," he said. "Every officer - military or civilian - I came across I was asking about my baby."He said one of the civilian officials he spoke to told him Sohail might have been evacuated by himself. "They said 'we don't have resources to keep the baby here.'"Mirza Ali, 35, Suraya, 32, and their other children, 17, 9, 6 and 3 years old, were put on an evacuation flight to Qatar and then to Germany and eventually landed in the United States. The family is now at Fort Bliss in Texas with other Afghan refugees waiting to be resettled somewhere in the United States. They have no relatives here.Mirza Ali said he saw other families handing their babies over the Kabul airport fence to soldiers at the same time. One video clip of a small baby in a diaper being hoisted by her arm over razor wire went viral on social media. She was later reunited with her parents.Ever since his baby went missing dates are a blur, Mirza Ali said. Every person he comes across - aid workers, US officials - he tells them about Sohail. "Everyone promises they will do their best, but they are just promises," he said.An Afghan refugee support group created a "Missing Baby" sign with Sohail's picture on it and are circulating it among their networks in the hopes that someone will recognize him.A US government official familiar with the situation said the case had been flagged for all the agencies involved, including the US bases and overseas locations. The child was last seen being handed to a US soldier during the chaos at the Kabul airport but "unfortunately no one can find the child," the official said.A Department of Defense spokesperson and a spokesperson for the US Department of Homeland Security, which is overseeing resettlement efforts, referred queries on the matter to the State Department, since the separation took place overseas. The State Department did not respond to a request for comment.Suraya, who also spoke through a translator, said she cries most of the time and that her other children are distraught."All I am doing is thinking about my child," Suraya said. "Everyone that is calling me, my mother, my father, my sister, they all comfort me and say 'don't worry, God is kind, your son will be found.'"||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twomonthold-baby-handed-to-us-soldiers-in-chaos-of-afghanistan-airlift-still-missing-101636133961763.html

This is now a global greenwashing festival."Delegates from nearly 200 countries are in Glasgow to hammer out how to meet the Paris Agreement goals of limiting temperature rises to between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius.The first week of talks saw countries announce plans to phase out coal use and to end foreign fossil fuel funding, but there were few details on how they plan the mass decarbonisation scientists say is needed.The promises followed a major assessment that showed global CO2 emissions are set to rebound in 2021 to pre-pandemic levels."They cannot ignore the scientific consensus and they cannot ignore us," said Thunberg."Our leaders are not leading. This is what leadership looks like," she said gesturing to the crowd.Two days of demonstrations are planned by activist groups to highlight the disconnect between the glacial pace of emissions reductions and the climate emergency already swamping countries across the world.Also Read | COP26 pledges could keep rise below 2°C: Key studies- Some progress -Onlookers to Friday's march lined the streets and hung out of windows to watch the stream of protestors, who held banners reading "No Planet B" and "Climate Action Now"."I'm here because the world leaders are deciding the fate of our future and the present of people that have already been impacted by climate crisis," said 18-year-old Valentina Ruas."We won't accept anything that isn't real climate policy centred on climate justice."Students were out in force, with some schools allowing pupils to skip lessons to see the march and one young green warrior holding a placard that read: "Climate change is worse than homework".Experts say a commitment made during the high-level leaders' summit at the start of COP26 by more than 100 nations to cut methane emissions by at least 30 percent this decade will have a real short-term impact on global heating.But environmental groups pointed out that governments, particularly wealthy polluters, have a habit of failing to live up to their climate promises."I expect this protest to remind world leaders and negotiators and politicians that young people are watching them," said Brianna Fruean, 23, from Western Samoa.Also Read | Explained: What Modi's ‘net zero by 2070’ pledge at COP26 means for climate- 'Take responsibility' -Countries came into COP26 with national climate plans that, when brought together, put Earth on course to warm 2.7C this century, according to the UN.With just 1.1C of warming so far, communities across the world are already facing ever more intense fire and drought, displacement and economic ruin wrought by the Earth's heating climate."Scientists have done what they need to do, they've told us about the problem. Young people have done what they need to do by calling attention to this issue," said Natalie Tariro Chido Mangondo, a Zimbabwean climate and gender advocate."And it's just up to our leaders to get their act together."Campaigners say they expect up to 50,000 demonstrators in the Scottish city on Saturday as part of a global round of climate protests.Summit organisers on Thursday confirmed that there had been a number of positive Covid-19 tests among attendees, but have said they will not provide figures on how many.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/it-is-not-a-secret-climate-activist-greta-thunberg-labels-cop26-failure-101636132706390.html

Late on Thursday it asked the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for approval to deploy a total of 7,774 satellites for the project.On Monday, Amazon asked the FCC for approval to launch and operate two prototype satellites by the end of 2022.Amazon said in its filing the satellites "will serve households, hospitals, businesses, government agencies, and other organizations around the world, including in geographic areas where reliable broadband remains lacking.""Although connectivity has improved on a global basis, only 51% of the global population, and 44% of the population of developing countries, are online," the company filing said.In 2020, the FCC approved the Project Kuiper plan for the constellation of low-Earth orbit satellites to compete with the Starlink network being built out by Elon Musk’s SpaceX.Amazon has sparred with Musk, recently accusing the billionaire of ignoring a variety of government-imposed rules.Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Musk are rivals in the private space launch business. Bezos' Blue Origin had challenged the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's decision to award a $2.9 billion lunar lander contract to SpaceX but a judge rejected the challenge on Thursday.SpaceX has deployed more than 1,700 satellites.Earlier this week, the FCC approved Boeing Co's application to launch and operate 147 satellites to provide high-speed broadband internet access.Boeing first filed with the FCC in 2017 seeking approval to deploy a V-band Constellation of mostly low-Earth orbit satellites.Boeing said this week it "sees a multi-orbit future for satellite technologies. As the demand for satellite communications grows, diversity will be required across orbital regimes and frequencies to satisfy unique customer demands."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amazon-seeks-us-approval-to-deploy-4-500-additional-satellites-for-internet-project-101636131553719.html
05-11-2021||World||US says no plans to reopen consulates with Biden-Xi Summit||The US and China are not considering reopening shuttered consulates in each country, the White House said Friday, after a report that said the move was under consideration as part of an upcoming virtual meeting between President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.“The meeting is part of our ongoing efforts to responsibly manage the competition between our countries, not about seeking specific deliverables,” Dean Lieberman, a spokesman for the US National Security Council, said in a statement.It was issued after a report in Politico that consulate reopenings were likely to be announced, a move that would be one of the biggest steps yet to repair fractured ties between the global powers. Politico’s report cited sources it did not identify. The US is also seeking to make progress on trade and climate issues, as well as start a bilateral nuclear weapons dialogue -- something Beijing has resisted. The US flatly denied any such pending announcement. “This is false. Reporting on reopening consulates is inaccurate. No such thing is even being considered or discussed,” the NSC spokesman said. “In advance of the meeting, we’ve been discussing a number of agenda items, and I can assure you that reopening consulates has not been part of that discussion.”Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Wang Wenbin responded to questions about the Politico report by saying “many incidents unilaterally provoked by the previous US administration gravely undermined China-US relations.” “We hope the US will redress its mistakes and work in the same direction with China to bring bilateral relations back on the right track,” Wang added at the regular press briefing Friday in Beijing. Wang said he had no new information on plans for a meeting between Xi and Biden.The Pentagon warned Wednesday that China is expanding its nuclear weapons capabilities more rapidly than previously believed, a development that comes after the US’s top uniformed military officer, General Mark Milley, said China’s test of hypersonic systems was close to a “Sputnik moment” for America. A group of four Democratic lawmakers wrote a letter to Biden urging him to make nuclear risk reduction measures with China a top priority in his meeting with Xi, which has yet to be scheduled. China, which resisted joining US-Russia arms control discussions last year, sees such moves as “dragging” China into “unfair arms talks” to contain China and justify American moves to strengthen its nuclear capability, the Communist Party-backed Global Times said in a report Friday.Still, overall US-China exchanges have increased after relations hit rock bottom in the final year of Donald Trump’s presidency, as he poured pressure on Beijing after the pandemic hit during his re-election campaign. In July 2020, Washington told China to shutter its consulate in Houston, prompting Beijing to retaliate with an order for a US diplomatic facility in the southwestern city of Chengdu to close. The Trump administration said the move was necessary because China directed criminal and covert activity to steal trade secrets and carry out malign influence operations across the US, though it never provided evidence of that.The two nations also traded visa restrictions on students and journalists during Trump’s time in office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-says-no-plans-to-reopen-consulates-with-biden-xi-summit-101636117213227.html

Many Taiwanese companies derive profits from doing business with the mainland. Tens of thousands of Taiwanese currently work in the mainland,” a Reuters article pointed out.In October, Chinese President Xi Jinping said China can and will be reunified, sending out a word of warning to the so-called Taiwan secessionists who “betray the motherland” but holding off on the threat to use force.“It has never ended well for those who forget their ancestors, betray the motherland, or split the country,” Xi said at Beijing’s Great Hall of the People on Saturday.The Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) reportedly sent nearly 200 aircraft for drills near Taiwan in October.Late October, China said it “firmly” opposes military links between Taiwan and the US after it emerged that American troops were training soldiers on the self-governed island.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/diehard-taiwan-separatists-criminally-liable-to-be-punished-says-china-101636112714085.html

He also possessed confidential materials without authorisation and engaged in superstitious activities for a long time,” the earlier report said.The accusation of “deserting” his post during the fight against Covid-19 - which first emerged in Wuhan in late 2019 - did not clarify what exactly he had done to attract such strong accusations from the authorities.“The investigation showed that Sun never stayed true to the party’s ideals and faith, displayed extremely inflated political ambition and very poor political integrity, issued groundless criticisms of the party’s policies, and spread political rumours,” the earlier report said.“The circumstances were particularly serious, the nature was particularly pernicious, the impact was extremely bad and the case must be handled with extreme seriousness,” it said.Sun “sold official posts, accepted a large amount of money and property, attended banquets and high-end entertainment activities that could affect the impartial performance of official duties, and indulged in a luxurious lifestyle for a long time”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-arrests-ex-minister-who-had-deserted-post-during-covid-outbreak-in-wuhan-101636110674351.html
05-11-2021||World||Pfizer says antiviral pill cuts risk of severe Covid-19 by 89%, to seek FDA nod||A trial of Pfizer Inc's experimental antiviral pill for COVID-19 was stopped early after the drug was shown to cut by 89% the chances of hospitalization or death for adults at risk of developing severe disease, the company said on Friday.The results appear to surpass those seen with Merck & Co Inc's pill, molnupiravir, which was shown last month to halve the likelihood of dying or being hospitalized for COVID-19 patients also at high risk of serious illness.Full trial data is not yet available from either company.Pfizer shares surged 11% to $48.55, while those of Merck fell 8.5% to $82.80. Shares of vaccine makers also took a hit, with Moderna Inc, Pfizer's German partner BioNTech SE and Novavax all down nearly 7%.Pfizer said it plans to submit interim trial results for its pill, which is given in combination with an older antiviral called ritonavir, to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as part of the emergency use application it opened in October.That filing is expected to be submitted before Thanksgiving, Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla said in an interview with CNBC.The combination treatment, which will have the brand name Paxlovid, consists of three pills given twice daily.The planned analysis of 1,219 patients in Pfizer's study looked at hospitalizations or deaths among people diagnosed with mild to moderate COVID-19 with at least one risk factor for developing severe disease, such as obesity or older age.It found that 0.8% of those given Pfizer's drug within three days of symptom onset were hospitalized and none had died by 28 days after treatment. That compared with a hospitalization rate of 7% for placebo patients. There were also seven deaths in the placebo group.Rates were similar for patients treated within five days of symptoms - 1% of the treatment group was hospitalized, compared with 6.7% for the placebo group, which included 10 deaths. Bourla said that works out to being 85% effective.The data compared favorably to Merck's oral antiviral in a similar patient population, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Louise Chen said in a note.With the virus still circulating widely and current therapeutic options requiring access to a healthcare facility, antiviral treatments that can be taken at home to keep people with COVID-19 out of the hospital are critically needed, Chen said.Antivirals need to be given as early as possible, before an infection takes hold, in order to be most effective. Merck tested its drug within five days of symptom onset."We saw that we did have high efficacy, even if it was five days after a patient has been treated ... people might wait a couple of days before getting a test or something, and this means that we have time to treat people and really provide a benefit from a public health perspective," Annaliesa Anderson, head of the Pfizer program, told Reuters.The company did not detail side effects of the treatment, but said adverse events happened in about 20% of both treatment and placebo patients. Ritonavir's possible side effects include nausea and diarrhea."These data suggest that our oral antiviral candidate, if approved by regulatory authorities, has the potential to save patients’ lives, reduce the severity of COVID-19 infections, and eliminate up to nine out of ten hospitalizations," Bourla said in a statement.Pfizer said it was currently expecting to produce more than 180,000 packs by the end of 2021 and at least 50 million packs by the end of 2022, of which 21 million would be produced in the first half.Infectious disease experts stress that preventing COVID-19 through wide use of vaccines remains the best way to control the pandemic, but only 58% of Americans are fully vaccinated and access in many parts of the world is limited.Pfizer's drug, part of a class known as protease inhibitors, is designed to block an enzyme the coronavirus needs in order to multiply.Merck's molnupiravir has a different mechanism of action designed to introduce errors into the genetic code of the virus. Merck has already sold millions of courses of the treatment, which was approved this week by U.K. regulators, to the United States, the U.K. and others.Britain said earlier this month it had secured 250,000 courses of Pfizer's antiviral.Pfizer is also studying whether its pill could be used by people without risk factors for serious COVID-19 as well as to prevent coronavirus infection in people exposed to the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-says-antiviral-pill-cuts-risk-of-severe-covid-19-by-89-to-seek-fda-nod-101636109444165.html

China’s Taiwan Affairs Office spokesperson Zhu Fenglian said in a statement on Friday that people named in a list of supporters of Taiwan’s independence will face sanctions, reported Reuters.Taiwan's Premier Su Tseng-chang, parliament Speaker You Si-kun and foreign minister Joseph Wu have been named in the list drawn up by China for being "stubbornly pro-Taiwan independence." For the first time, China has spelt out punishment for people deemed to be in favour of Taiwan’s independence, and thus, are against its ‘One-China’ policy under which it considers the self-ruled island as its territory.China has been pushing to implement the Hong Kong system in the self-governing island which considers itself as sovereign. While Hong Kong, a former British Colony, had returned to Chinese rule on condition of higher autonomy, Beijing has severely curtailed it through various laws, the latest being the national security law.Also Read | China to have at least 1,000 nuclear warheads by 2030: US defence reportMeanwhile, the self-ruled island has been reporting repeated incursions by the Chinese air force in Taiwan's air defence identification zone (ADIZ) as Beijing has become more assertive on the reunification of Taiwan with China under “one country, two systems.”Zhu said that China will now prohibit the “pro-Taiwan independence” people from entering the mainland and China's Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau, reported Reuters. They will also be barred from cooperating with people or entities from the mainland, the spokesperson added.China wants to send a message, Zhu said, to the supporters of Taiwan independence that "[t]hose who forget their ancestors, betray the motherland and split the country, will never end up well and will be spurned by the people and judged by history."(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-punish-taiwan-independence-supporters-as-tension-with-island-grows-101636108713569.html

The company has, however, introduced a new way to login to your account. According to reports, a person having a Google account will need to go through a two-step verification (2SV) process. This new way of login is expected to provide an additional layer of protection to your Google account.“For years, Google has been at the forefront of innovation in two-step verification (2SV), one of the most reliable ways to prevent unauthorized access to accounts and networks. 2SV is strongest when it combines both "something you know" (like a password) and "something you have" (like your phone or a security key)," Google had said in a blog post in October.- Once the 2SV is auto-enrolled to sign in to your Google account, login with a password first.- You will then need to give your mobile number. An OTP (one-time-password) will be sent via text, voice call, or Google’s mobile app.- After receiving the OTP, you will need to provide the code in the login bar.Many people have already gone through the 2SV earlier while logging into their Google accounts for the first time recently or using a new device to sign in. Starting November 9, the process will be activated on all Google accounts and users will need to go through the two-step verification to be able to access their accounts.The two-step verification is meant to ensure security from possible attacks from hackers. The process, which includes your password as well as your phone number, will ensure that hackers cannot access your information even if they have your password. Even if someone has your password, they will need to know the verification code sent on your phone to access your account while logging in.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-account-update-here-s-what-will-change-from-nov-9-101636107463876.html
05-11-2021||World||China LGBT rights group shuts down amid hostile environment||An influential LGBT advocacy group in China that has spearheaded many of the legal cases pushing for greater rights is halting its work amid growing restrictions on social activism.LGBT Rights Advocacy China announced it was ceasing all activities and shutting down its social media accounts in an announcement on social media Thursday.“We are deeply regretful to tell everyone, Queer Advocacy Online will stop all of our work indefinitely,” the group said on WeChat, using the name of its social media account. It closed its accounts on WeChat and Weibo, two widely used platforms in China.A member confirmed that all the group’s activities have been shut down. The member, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because of safety concerns, declined to say why. Group founder Peng Yanzi did not respond to a request for comment.LGBT Rights Advocacy China did work across the country, pushing for the rights of gay people and raising awareness about the community. It advocated for same-sex marriage and fought workplace discrimination by helping individuals sue their former employers.While there are many other groups focused on helping LGBT individuals, LGBT Rights Advocacy is one of a handful who focused on changing law and policy.The Ministry of Civil Affairs announced Friday that they have dealt with 3,300 illegal social organizations, according to the official Xinhua News Agency. The ministry also shut down some 200 illegal websites and individual social media accounts that were not registered with any government entity.It is unclear if the group was shut down as part of the government campaign. The ministry did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment.The group mentioned they were in trouble a few months ago, said a 30-year-old LGBT activist who knows the group's founders and who spoke on condition of anonymity. Lawyers who helped the group with cases had also stopped their work then.LGBT Rights Advocacy China was co-founded by Peng and another activist named AQiang in 2013, and focused their efforts on securing legal rights for LGBT individuals through strategic lawsuits.One of their most high profile cases came early on in 2014, when Peng himself went undercover to a facility that claimed it could “treat” homosexuality with electroshock therapy. He sued the company and won.The group often brought landmark cases to the court, challenging the law to make space for non-traditional families, and often helped start public discussions on those issues.In April last year, they helped a lesbian sue for custody rights for her children, after her partner took them and stopped communicating with her. She had given birth to one of the two children. Under Chinese law, she could claim she was the birth mother of one child, but wanted to fight for the right to see the other as well. Her case is still lingering in court.The group also helped a young woman sue textbook publishers for writing that homosexuality was a disorder in a high profile case that gained national prominence and was reported on by state media. She lost the case in February, after years of litigation.“In the entire community, they gave us a lot of hope and guidance, giving everyone the confidence to go out there and do something" said a 34-year-old man, who sued his former employer in 2018 for discrimination and won with the help of the group. He declined to be named out of fear of retribution, citing the current environment.Homosexuality is not a crime in China, and in bigger cities, there’s a vibrant social scene where LGBT individuals can socialize without much fear or discrimination. However, restrictions on advocacy groups and online censorship have grown.In July, WeChat shut down dozens of accounts run by university students and non-profit groups on LGBT topics.One LGBT blogger, who also declined to be named out of fear of retribution, said it's getting increasingly difficult to run an LGBT group in current circumstances, noting that WeChat and other social media platforms are deleting related content.Shanghai Pride canceled its annual event in 2020 and said it would no longer hold it without explanation after 11 years of operation.Another well-known group, True Self, which often held events to teach families how to accept their LGBT children, would tell people to not mention the word “gay” in publicizing their events, said the man who had previously sued his employer for discrimination. “The space for acceptance for sexual minorities is less and less, it’s not like before.”Pandemic restrictions also played a role in cutting down on the number of events the groups would hold, he added.For now, groups are struggling to operate within the constraints.“The future may bring more uncertainties, we await the day when we can lift the clouds and see the daylight," LGBT Rights Advocacy China said in their post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-lgbt-rights-group-shuts-down-amid-hostile-environment-101636103090001.html

On this special occasion, families and friends would typically gather to feast, exchange gifts, and pray, as they light up their homes with diyas,” Trudeau said in a message released by his office.Anand, who became the first Hindu to feature in the federal cabinet when she was appointed in 2019, also wished those celebrating on Twitter. “This is a time to celebrate light over darkness, good over evil. May your day be bright and beautiful!” She wrote.Trudeau also sent out greetings for Bandi Chhor Divas, saying, “This celebration is also a reminder of the values Canadians hold dear – freedom, inclusion, and respect. It gives us an opportunity to thank Canadians of the Sikh faith for their contributions to our country, and to learn more about their traditions.”Minister of international development Harjit Sajjan also tweeted his wishes: “As diyas brighten our homes, we are reminded of the triumph of light over darkness.”In-person celebrations were possible this year as the Public Health Agency of Canada had earlier issued guidelines for small gatherings of those who are fully vaccinated.While the community did celebrate, they were careful to institute measures like social distancing. Brampton resident Milan Patel said, “Restrictions have opened up which is kind of a relief for the community. These are not large or grand celebrations but on a smaller scale but we hope next year things will be closer to normal.”Canada Post has also issued a special commemorative stamp to mark Diwali this year. Designed by Seung Jai Paek, it is layered with a Rangoli pattern and features a lotus, symbolising new beginnings, which forms both the outline and inset, along with a ring of heart-shaped diyas expressing love and gratitude; and a spice box in the centre alluding to the food shared during the Festival of Lights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadas-trudeau-extends-greetings-on-diwali-bandi-chhor-divas-101636101973144.html

The Ottawa-headquartered independent non-profit organization Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) described this as a “new record” in total health spending for the country.“Covid-19 resulted in the single biggest increase in health spending we have ever seen in this country. An aging population and the continued pandemic will no doubt put more strain on our health systems and take up a larger proportion of government budgets. Challenges lie ahead, no doubt — but so do opportunities as improved technologies, pharmaceuticals and models of care can lead to better health outcomes for Canadians,” said CIHI president and CEO David O’Toole in a statement.Health spending is expected to have increased by nearly 12% between 2019 and 2020, a rate of increase not witnessed in three decades. “This is triple the growth rate experienced from 2015 to 2019, which was steady at approximately 4% per year. This historic spending increase took place alongside a contraction in the economy, both due in part to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic,” the CIHI statement noted.Health care is in the public domain in Canada and accounts for about 40% of provincial and territorial budgets. Hospitals, drugs and physicians were the three highest areas of spending and, combined, were expected to represent over half the total outgo in 2021. “But a new spending category, referred to as Covid-19 response funding, will make up about 7% — or $23 billion — of total health spending. This category includes costs for things like Covid-19 treatment, contact tracing and vaccinations,” CIHI said.So far at least 88% of eligible Canadians have received at least a dose of a Covid-19 jab, with nearly 84% now fully vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-to-push-canada-s-health-care-spending-to-record-levels-101636100592929.html

The report also highlighted that Beijing is taking “incremental and tactical actions to press its claims” at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with India despite participating in talk to resolve the crisis.“The accelerating pace of the PRC’s (People’s Republic of China) nuclear expansion may enable the PRC to have up to 700 deliverable nuclear warheads by 2027,” the US defence department said in its annual report on China released on Wednesday. “The PRC likely intends to have at least 1,000 warheads by 2030, exceeding the pace and size the DoD (Department of Defence) projected in 2020.”The report further said that China has possibly already established a “nascent nuclear triad” with a a nuclear capable air-launched ballistic missile and improvement of its ground and sea-based nuclear capabilities. Additionally, developments in 2020 suggest that China “intends to increase the peacetime readiness of its nuclear forces by moving to a launch-on-warning posture with an expanded silo-based force”, the report said.China’s nuclear policy is currently based on a strategy to survive the first strike and then respond with overwhelming force to inflict “unacceptable damage” on the enemy to deter it from launching another attack. Beijing publicly declared a “no first use” policy and it had undertaken not use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against a non-nuclear armed state or in a nuclear-weapon free zone. But the report pointed to continued ambiguity when these conditions will not be applied.China currently has an estimated 330 nuclear warheads, according to an updated count by the Federation of American Scientists. It has the third largest stockpile after the United States and Russia, and even at the accelerated pace of acquisition, China will remain at that position. France with 290 warheads, the United Kingdom with 225, Pakistan with 165, India with 160, Israel with 90 and North Korea with 45 are the other nuclear-armed countries.The US defence department report also talks at length about China’s border dispute with India, reiterating Washington’s long-held position that it blames China for starting the ongoing tensions through incursions. “Beginning in May 2020, the PLA (People’s Liberation Army, as the Chinese military is called) launched incursions into customarily Indian-controlled territory across the border and has concentrated troops at several standoff locations along the LAC,” the report said.It highlights Chinese attempts to continue pressing its claims at the LAC even as it participates in talks to resolve the situation. “Despite the ongoing diplomatic and military dialogues to reduce border tensions, the PRC has continued taking incremental and tactical actions to press its claims at the LAC,” it said, pointing to a large 100-home civilian village China has constructed “inside disputed territory” between Tibet and Arunachal Pradesh.The report notes that Beijing seems keen, at the same time, to prevent the border standoff from developing into “into a wider military conflict” and wants to “return bilateral relations with New Delhi to a state of economic and diplomatic cooperation it had perceived to be improving since the 2017 Doklam standoff”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-expanding-nuclear-arsenal-faster-than-anticipated-us-defence-report-101636098972765.html

05-11-2021||World||US authorities arrest analyst who aided ex Donald Trump-Russia probe||US authorities have arrested a Russia analyst who provided information for a Democrat-funded dossier on former President Donald Trump's ties to Russia during the 2016 US presidential election, the US Justice Department said Thursday.Igor Danchenko is facing charges of providing false statements to the FBI as part of special counsel John Durham's ongoing investigation.The dossier and the Durham probe have faced accusations that they are politically motivated.What did Igor Danchenko do?Danchenko functioned as a source for Christopher Steele, a former British spy who was paid by Democrats to compile the dossier into links between Russia and Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign.The dossier was ultimately used by the FBI as it applied for and received surveillance warrants targeting a former Trump campaign aide.Danchenko allegedly lied about the source of information included in the so-called "Steele dossier" when questioned about his work, the Justice Department stated.Danchenko is the third person, and second in a two-month span, to face charges related to the dossier.What is behind the investigations?Under Trump, the Justice Department appointed Durham to carry out an investigation into the dossier.Trump claimed the investigation of campaign ties to Russia was a witch hunt. He pointed to the dossier, some of which remains uncorroborated or has been discredited, as evidence of a tainted probe driven by Democrats.But the dossier had no role in the launching of the FBI's Trump-Russia investigation, which was placed in the hands of special counsel Robert Mueller.While Mueller ultimately found questionable ties between Trump's campaign and Russia, he concluded there was not sufficient evidence to pursue criminal charges.Democrats have lambasted the Durham probe as politically motivated, but the Biden administration has not stopped it.Durham's probe has already indicted a cybersecurity lawyer accused of making a false statement to the FBI and an FBI lawyer who admitted to altering an email.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-authorities-arrest-analyst-who-aided-ex-donald-trump-russia-probe-101636091302071.html
05-11-2021||World||Jack Ma, Trump and Xi: The story of Chinese billionaire's fall||This was supposed to be Jack Ma's finest hour: a year ago to the day, his Ant Group was meant to go public in a $37 billion blaze of glory. Instead Beijing reined in his empire, abruptly clipping the wings of corporate China's biggest star.Now, to the cautious cheer of investors, the billionaire Alibaba e-commerce tycoon is taking his first tentative steps back on to the global stage with a low-key trip to Europe where he's cultivating hobbies like horticulture.It's a far cry from the height of Ma's statesman-like powers in 2017 when he travelled to New York to meet President-elect Donald Trump for one-on-one talks in Trump Tower days before inauguration and promised to create a million American jobs.That high-profile outing had roiled the Chinese government, which first learned of the meeting and jobs pledge along with the rest of the world when Ma held an informal televised Q&A session with reporters in the lobby of the skyscraper, according to four people close to Alibaba with knowledge of the matter and one Beijing government source.Alibaba's government relations team was subsequently told by Chinese officials that Beijing was unhappy about Ma meeting Trump without its prior approval, two of the people close to the company said.Ma's charitable foundation, which handles his media queries, did not respond to a request for comment.The State Council Information Office and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not respond to requests for comment. All the sources declined to be named due to sensitivity of the matter.The meeting on Jan. 9 came at a time of taut tensions between the two countries after Trump was critical of China during his election campaign, blaming it for the loss of American jobs.A spokesperson for Trump did not respond to a request for comment.The four people close to Alibaba said they believed the meeting was a negative turning point in the relationship between Ma and Beijing. They did not elaborate on their thinking.Investors are hungry for clues about Ma's situation: the mere sighting of the businessman on the Spanish island of Mallorca last month, his first trip abroad in over a year, immediately saw Alibaba gain as much as $42 billion in value.The story of his fall from official favour helps illustrate how rapidly China has transformed under Xi Jinping, as he nears what could be a precedent-breaking third term as leader of the economic powerhouse and exerts greater control over some of its most innovative companies. 'A NATURAL FIRST TARGET'Authorities cracked down on Ma's business empire after he gave a speech in Shanghai in October last year accusing financial watchdogs of stifling innovation. Regulators suspended the $37 billion listing of his fintech firm Ant Group two days before the planned debut on Nov. 5, ordered that Ant be restructured and launched antitrust investigations into Ma's businesses, eventually leading to a record $2.75 billion fine for Alibaba in April.The clampdown has spread across the private sector, with officials tightening oversight of companies in technology, real estate, gaming, education, cryptocurrencies and finance."Given that Jack appeared too provocative, out of step with the new approach to governance espoused by Xi, he was a natural first target to signal that a major change had begun," said Duncan Clark, chairman of Beijing-based investment advisory firm BDA China and author of a book on Alibaba and Ma."Jack was rubbing shoulders regularly with foreign presidents, prime ministers, royalty, celebrities at places like Davos or on his own visits overseas. There was a constant stream of VIP visitors to see him in Hangzhou too."Ma's global outreach did not end after the Trump meeting, though.Between 2018 and 2020 he held talks with a host of high-profile figures, including U.N. Secretary General António Guterres, Queen Rania of Jordan, Malaysia's veteran politician Mahathir Mohamad and then Belgian premier Charles Michel, according to Alibaba's news portal Alizila and media reports.At Alibaba's Hangzhou headquarters, it has a building housing the company's museum where Ma and his business partner Joe Tsai would take foreign visitors and show them around, according to another person close to Ma.Tsai did not respond to a request for comment via Alibaba.Ma had viewed meetings with foreign politicians as "unofficial diplomacy" for China, which he enjoyed doing, the person added.Alibaba told Reuters it had a guest reception facility widely known as Pavilion 9 that offered a visual tour of its history and an overview of its businesses. It has hosted a wide variety of guests at the exhibition hall in its headquarters, it added.The company did not respond to other queries for this story.'JUST LIKE YOU AND ME'In a sign of how life has changed for one of China's most successful and influential businessmen, Ma requested an audience with at least two people in Xi's inner circle in the weeks following the blocking of Ant's listing, but his requests were turned down by both, said two separate sources briefed by those people. The billionaire subsequently wrote directly to Xi earlier this year offering to devote the rest of his life to China's rural education, according to a government source who said the president spoke about the letter at a meeting of the country's senior leaders in May.Reuters could not determine whether Xi approved of or responded to the offer, which has not been previously reported, or precisely when Ma, a former English teacher, penned the missive.The Alibaba-owned South China Morning Post said last month Ma was visiting Europe on an "agriculture and technology study tour related to environmental issues", citing a person familiar with his itinerary.Last week the paper published pictures of Ma wearing a white protective gown and holding flowerpots. It said he would continue touring European companies and research institutions involved in agricultural infrastructure and plant breeding, citing people familiar with his plans.Tsai, the co-founder of Alibaba, played down his long-time associate's influence in a rare interview about the elusive billionaire with CNBC's Squawk Box show in June."He's lying low right now. I talk to him every day," Tsai said. "The idea that Jack has this enormous amount of power, I think that's not quite right," he added."He is just like you and me, he's a normal individual."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jack-ma-trump-and-xi-the-story-of-chinese-billionaire-s-fall-101636089433245.html
05-11-2021||World||Covid-19 outbreak in China continues to spread as cases near 800||China’s latest Covid-19 outbreak continues to grow as it shifts east through the nation’s rust belt, prompting officials to implement increasingly stringent prevention measures in an effort to control it. The country’s health commission reported 68 local confirmed cases on Friday, plus 22 additional infections that didn’t cause any symptoms. Heilongjiang province in the northeast, which accounted for more than one-third of the total, has become the latest epicenter as a mysterious cluster that emerged in the northern border town Heihe ballooned despite a city-wide lockdown.  The latest wave, driven by the highly infectious delta variant, has reached 20 mainland provinces and is now the broadest outbreak since the virus first appeared in Wuhan in 2019. Nearly 800 people have been diagnosed in the past three weeks. While the number of infections may seem low compared to the west, where tens of thousands of cases are reported daily, the zero-tolerance approach pursued in the world’s second-largest economy means the rising case count is cause for concern. China still embarks on mass testing whenever a single case of the deadly pathogen is detected, quarantines everyone that could be infected and limits transportation to other locations to cut off possible transmission. Beijing reported zero cases for the past two days, after the country ring-fenced the political hub with escalating restrictions, including halting inbound trains from more than 23 locations where infections have been found during the latest outbreak. Hebei, which borders Beijing, reported 10 days on Friday.Many municipal governments have urged residents not to travel across provinces and discouraged unnecessary departures from their cities. Wuzhen Scenic Area, a popular tourist spot in eastern Zhejiang province, said it was temporarily shut after one visitor tested positive for the virus. There is no indication about when it will resume operations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-outbreak-in-china-continues-to-spread-as-cases-near-800-101636084151004.html

And internal studies spotlighted the potential risks of its Instagram photo-sharing app for teen girls. The company, valued at $934 billion, rebranded itself as Meta last month.“The disturbing thing is that people have said a long time ago that Facebook was doing this, but people said, ‘Well, they didn’t understand or they didn’t measure it,’” Schmidt said. “And what we learned in those disclosures is that these companies -- and Facebook in particular -- knew what it was doing.”Still, Schmidt said he opposes trying to regulate the tech industry. “The regulation is always either too soon or too late,” said the executive, who was CEO and chairman of Google from 2001 to 2011 and executive chairman of the company until 2018. “What I would rather have is sort of proper industrial restraint,” he said.Haugen, a former Facebook employee, testified last month before a panel of the Senate Commerce Committee. At the hearing, she criticized the company for not prioritizing the well-being of its users over profits. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has denied the characterizations, saying they’re “just not true.”Schmidt, 66, is the co-author of a new book called “The Age of AI” -- along with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and computer scientist Dan Huttenlocher -- that examines how artificial intelligence is transforming human society for better and for worse.Schmidt remains a technical adviser and top investor at Google’s parent, Alphabet Inc., and he’s chairman of the Broad Institute research center. While at Google, he orchestrated the acquisition of YouTube, another social service with billions of users that has drawn criticism for spreading misinformation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-knew-what-it-was-doing-former-google-ceo-eric-schmidt-101636082506053.html

All you need to know about the drug||The UK has approved a Covid-19 antiviral pill jointly developed by US-based Merck & Co Inc and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics to become the first country in the world to recommend the drug, molnupiravir.The nod is the first for an oral antiviral treatment for Covid-19 and the first for a coronavirus disease drug that will be administered widely in the community."We are now working across government and the NHS to urgently get this treatment to patients initially through a national study so we can collect more data on how antivirals work in a mostly vaccinated population," UK vaccines minister Maggie Throup told parliament.The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) recommended molnupiravir for use in people with mild to moderate Covid-19 and at least one risk factor for developing severe illness, such as obesity, older age diabetes, and heart disease.Also watch | Britain approves anti-covid oral pill for mild to moderate patientsThe agency said, citing clinical data, that it will be administered as soon as possible following a positive Covid-19 test and within five days of the onset of symptoms of the viral disease. It is to be taken twice a day for five days.Professor Stephen Powis, national medical director for the National Health Service (NHS) in England, said the drug would be administered to patients at higher risk of complications. Powis added that a wider rollout will follow if it is clinically and cost-effective in reducing hospitalisations and death.Also read | Merck Covid-19 pill sparks calls for access for lower income countriesThe antiviral pill, which will be branded as Lagevrio in Britain, targets an enzyme the coronavirus, which causes Covid-19, uses to reproduce itself, inserting errors into its genetic code that slow its ability to spread and take over human cells. That genetic activity has led some independent experts to question whether the drug could potentially cause mutations leading to birth defects or tumours.Merck has said that viral sequencing done so far has shown molnupiravir is effective against all variants of the coronavirus, including the more-infectious Delta, which is responsible for the worldwide surge in hospitalisations and deaths recently. The company has not disclosed details on molnupiravir’s side effects but said that rates of those problems were similar between people who got the drug and those who received dummy pills.Also read | Alarm bells in 53 European, Central Asian countries, WHO warns of new Covid waveMerck announced preliminary results in September showing its drug cut hospitalisations and deaths by half among patients with early Covid-19 symptoms.

The exact number of staff involved is unclear.The aide, who tested positive via a rapid test, is in quarantine in Scotland and awaiting a follow-up PCR test, a White House official said. The aide is not believed to have had close contact with the president. Biden himself tested negative on Tuesday, the official said Thursday evening. The aide is on the National Security Council staff, according to the people. Staff members who had contact with the aide have so far tested negative, the official said. They were supposed to fly back to Washington with Biden Sunday on Air Force One or a support plane, but have since returned on other government aircraft.   White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki intended to travel with Biden but remained home in Washington after family members contracted Covid-19. She was infected herself over the weekend, she announced. Psaki said Thursday she had symptoms, including fatigue and chills, but has been working from home since the day she got her positive test. She is fully vaccinated and recently received a booster shot.Officials don’t think the NSC aide’s illness is tied to Psaki’s, several people familiar with the matter said.The people familiar with the matter spoke on condition of anonymity because the White House has not publicly disclosed the positive case in Europe or any measures taken to prevent further transmission.Psaki has said that the White House would make public infections among “commissioned officers” on Biden’s staff, which generally means senior aides with the words “assistant to the president” in their titles. That includes Psaki herself.The White House on Thursday night declined to say if the aide is a commissioned officer. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti also tested positive for Covid-19 while at the COP26 summit in Glasgow, according to his spokesperson.Former President Donald Trump faced significant criticism for efforts by his White House to conceal the extent of a coronavirus outbreak among his staff before he stood for re-election last November. Several other foreign leaders skipped the Group of 20 summit in Rome and the UN climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, at least in part out of concern about the continuing pandemic. But Biden said he thought it was important to attend the meetings in person, and he chided China’s president, Xi Jinping, in particular for not participating.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-official-who-accompanied-biden-in-glasgow-summit-tests-positive-for-covid-101636072406199.html

Europe is back at the epicentre of the pandemic, where we were one year ago,” WHO's Europe head Hans Kluge told reporters from the WHO Europe headquarters in Copenhagen, Denmark.Kluge said case counts are beginning to near-record levels again and the pace of transmission in the region, which stretches as far east as the former Soviet republics in Central Asia, is of “grave concern.”Also read | Biden admin mandates compulsory Covid jabs or tests for private firm workersEuropean countries must work harder to prevent the coronavirus from spreading further as deaths and new cases surge, Kluge added. He said the difference now is that health authorities know more about the virus and have better tools to combat it. Relaxed prevention measures and low vaccination rates in some areas explain the latest surge, he said.WHO Europe has said that the region saw nearly 1.8 million new weekly Covid-19 cases, an increase of about 6 per cent from the previous week, and 24,000 deaths in the same period or a 12 per cent rise.Also read | Germany reports record number of new Covid-19 casesKluge said hospitalisation rates due to Covid-19 in the 53-country region more than doubled over the last week.
