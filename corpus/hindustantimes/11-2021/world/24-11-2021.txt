Booster shots of mRNA vaccine have been offered to people aged 65 or above, with an eye to eventually extending the shots to other groups."We are faced with an uncertain winter," Health Minister Lena Hallengren told a news conference. "You can contribute by staying home if you're sick or by getting vaccinated if you haven't already, and taking your booster when you're offered it."Slovakia reported its highest daily rise in cases on Wednesday when the government approved a two-week lockdown, broadcaster TA3 and other media reported, citing Economy Minister Richard Sulik, to quell the world's fastest surge in infections.VACCINATION RESERVATIONSNeighbouring Austria has already locked down its population this week for at least 10 days, becoming the first to reimpose such restrictions. It will also require the whole population to be vaccinated from Feb. 1, infuriating many in a country where scepticism about state mandates affecting individual freedoms runs high.The Czech Republic reported its highest daily rise in infections, with cases surpassing 25,000 for the first time and putting further strain on hospitals. The government is looking to institute mandatory vaccines for people over 60 and some professions, like healthcare workers.The Netherlands recorded more than 23,700 coronavirus infections in 24 hours, the highest number since the start of the pandemic, and the government will announce new measures on Friday.Hungary reported a record 12,637 new daily COVID-19 cases.Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government, which opposes further lockdowns for fear of stifling the economy, launched a vaccination campaign this week, offering shots without prior registration.But the idea of mandatory vaccinations has also raised concerns among Hungarians.Authorities in Russia, where daily coronavirus-related deaths are near record highs, said they were scouring social networks and media websites to find people spreading false claims about the dangers of vaccination, the latest in a series of measures to invigorate sluggish inoculation rates.France will announce new COVID containment measures on Thursday as the infection rate surges nationwide.Italy is expected to restrict access to some indoor venues for people who have not been vaccinated.Poland will have to tighten restrictions if it does not see daily case numbers decreasing in the near future, the health minister said.Many German regions have already started to impose tighter rules amid the country's worst COVID surge yet as the curtain comes down on the Angela Merkel era, including demanding that vaccinated people show a negative test to attend indoor events.Outgoing Health Minister Jens Spahn said on Monday that by the end of the winter almost everyone in Germany would be "vaccinated, recovered or dead".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-resurgence-in-europe-forces-govts-to-rethink-need-for-booster-shots-101637777163041.html

24-11-2021||World||Key Taliban leader’s intervention led to Pakistan’s nod for supply of wheat from India||Days before the Taliban’s acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi embarked on a visit to Pakistan on November 10, one of his aides reached out to an intermediary to ascertain whether there were any India-related issues that should be raised in Islamabad. The aide from Muttaqi’s office also wanted to ascertain from the intermediary whether there were any sensitivities that should be kept in mind in the Taliban foreign policy chief’s maiden engagement with the Pakistani leadership, people familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. Muttaqi’s aide was informed about the need to take up with the Pakistani leadership the offer made by India several weeks ago to supply 50,000 tonnes of wheat to Afghanistan, and the pressing need to make travel arrangements for hundreds of Afghan citizens stranded across India since the fall of the Ashraf Ghani government in August, the people said. Pakistan had not responded to India’s proposal to ship the wheat to Afghanistan via the Wagah land border crossing in the absence of direct flights. The Taliban delegation led by Muttaqi, which was in Pakistan for three days, raised both issues with top leaders such as foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi and Prime Minister Imran Khan. As a result, Khan announced on November 22 that his government would allow the shipment of the Indian wheat as soon as modalities were worked out by Islamabad and New Delhi. Khan said Pakistan would also facilitate the return of Afghans who had gone to India for medical treatment and were stuck there. This outreach by Muttaqi’s camp and the Taliban’s balanced response to the November 10 meeting of senior security officials of seven countries, including Iran and Russia, that was convened by India are being seen in some quarters as an attempt by the Taliban to strike a balance in their attempts to forge relations with Pakistan and India. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid had said the first regional meeting on Afghanistan convened by India was in the “better interest of Afghanistan” and reiterated the group’s policy on not allowing Afghan soil to be “used against any country”. The Taliban, he added, had no “objection or anxiety” about the meeting. “Though we are not present in this conference, we firmly believe this conference is in the better interest of Afghanistan...and the participating countries also must be thoughtful of improving and safeguarding the security situation in Afghanistan and helping the current government to ensure security in the country on its own,” Mujahid said. One of the people cited above said: “It is difficult to gauge their sincerity but they do seem to be going through the motions to create an impression that they want a balance between Pakistan and India. It also suits the Taliban to be seen as not completely reliant on Pakistan.” The Indian side, which had opened channels of communication with sections of the Taliban leadership last year, has made it clear it is in no rush to give legitimacy or recognition to the Taliban setup. New Delhi has insisted that Afghanistan must not be used for planning or executing terror attacks on other countries and an inclusive government must be formed in Kabul. Participating in an online event organised on Wednesday by the Indian Chamber of Commerce, foreign secretary Harsh Shringla described the Indian side’s conversations so far with the Taliban as “very reassuring” but also listed the world community’s continuing concerns on Afghanistan. Though the rapid developments in Afghanistan amounted to a setback, he said: “We have also established some contact with the Taliban both in Doha as well as in Moscow in the talks, and I think the Taliban in our conversation with them have been very reassuring. They have recognised that India has contributed greatly to the people of Afghanistan that our developmental projects over the last 20 years have greatly contributed to Afghanistan’s development.” He added the Taliban “want us to provide humanitarian assistance; they want us to re-establish our embassy there. So they have said good things, which is a good start.” India, Shringla said, will now “have to see how best to protect our interests, make the best of a difficult situation”, and also make sure the country is “not in any way vulnerable to the new strategic realities” of the region. He referred to the UN Security Council resolution 2593 on Afghanistan and said it lays down the international community’s expectations of the Taliban. “One is an inclusive negotiated political settlement, the second is that its territory should not be used against the detriment of any others, the third is that they should provide humanitarian access, the fourth is that there should be no human rights abuses on women, children and minorities,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/key-taliban-leader-s-intervention-led-to-pakistan-s-nod-for-supply-of-wheat-from-india-101637773824674.html
24-11-2021||World||Over 20 migrants dead in deadliest English Channel disaster||Over 20 migrants died Wednesday crossing the Channel from France to England when their boat sank off the northern port of Calais, authorities said, the deadliest single disaster on the intensively-used route.The French interior ministry said in a statement that French patrol vessels found corpses and people unconscious in the water after a fisherman sounded the alarm about the accident. Police then said in a statement that "over 20" people had died.Three helicopters and three boats have been deployed to take part in the search, local authorities said.Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin, who is heading to the scene, wrote on Twitter that "many people" had died in the incident, adding that "the criminal nature of the smugglers who organise these crossings cannot be condemned enough.""The disaster in the Channel is a tragedy," added Prime Minister Jean Castex. "My thoughts are with the many missing and injured, victims of criminal smugglers who exploit their distress and misery," he wrote on Twitter.The disaster, the worst single loss of life recorded in recent times from migrant crossings in the Channel, comes as tensions grow between London and Paris over the record numbers of people crossing.Britain has urged tougher action from France to stop migrants making the voyage.- Growing post-Brexit tensions -According to the French authorities, 31,500 people attempted to leave for Britain since the start of the year and 7,800 people have been rescued at sea, figures which doubled since August.Seven people have been confirmed dead or are still missing feared drowned after various incidents this year.In Britain, the ruling right-wing Conservative party of Prime Minister Boris Johnson is coming under intense pressure, including from its own supporters, to reduce the numbers crossing.French police said this week they detained 15 suspected members of an international migrant smuggling syndicate that helped people illegally cross the Channel to Britain.The network of Iraqi Kurds, Romanians, Pakistanis and Vietnamese helped a minimum of 250 people per month cross to England, using small boats that transport up to 60 migrants at a time.Passage to England would cost a migrant 6,000 euros ($6,800) and the smugglers racked up some 3 million euros ($3.4 million) in total profits.According to British authorities, more than 25,000 people have now arrived illegally so far this year, already triple the figure recorded in 2020.The issue has added to growing post-Brexit tensions between Britain and France, with a row on fishing rights also still unresolved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-20-dead-in-migrant-boat-accident-in-english-channel-101637771301963.html

It will also require the whole population to be vaccinated from Feb. 1, infuriating many in a country where scepticism about state mandates affecting individual freedoms runs high.The Czech Republic reported its highest daily rise in infections, with cases surpassing 25,000 for the first time and putting further strain on hospitals.The country of 10.7 million has the world’s fourth-highest infection rate per capita, according to Our World in Data.The Czech government, due to hand over power in the coming weeks after losing an October election, has put in place measures barring unvaccinated people from restaurants, cinemas and other services such as hairdressers, aiming to boost vaccination figures that lag many in the European Union.The outgoing government is also looking to institute mandatory vaccines for people over 60 and some professions, like healthcare workers.Hungary reported a record 12,637 new daily Covid cases, bringing the total to 1.045 million with 33,519 deaths.Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s government, which opposes further lockdowns for fear of stifling the economy, launched a vaccination campaign this week, offering shots without prior registration.However, the idea of mandatory vaccinations has raised concerns among Hungarians, with some expressing reservations despite already being vaccinated.“Making the vaccine obligatory is a difficult thing as it could limit people severely, including from earning a living, so I think such a decision should be made very carefully,” said Zsuzsanna Koszoru as she lined up for a booster jab.Many German regions have already started to impose tighter rules amid the country’s worst Covid surge yet as the curtain comes down on the Angela Merkel era, including demanding that vaccinated people show a negative test to attend indoor events.Outgoing Health Minister Jens Spahn said on Monday that by the end of the winter almost everyone in Germany would be “vaccinated, recovered or dead”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-rethinks-booster-shot-policy-as-covid-cases-hit-records-101637767597313.html
24-11-2021||World||UAE keen on speedy restoration of air services with India, says envoy||The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is keen on speedy restoration of normal air services with India as the lack of adequate flights is posing difficulties for travellers and has led to a spike in air fares, UAE ambassador Ahmed AlBanna said on Wednesday. Under the air bubble arrangement worked out by the two countries following the Covid-19 pandemic, Emirates and Etihad, the flag carriers of the UAE, are currently operating at 30% of their total capacity under the normal air services agreement. This is affecting traffic and the price of a return ticket has increased to almost ₹200,000 from the pre-pandemic rate of around ₹80,000 to ₹90,000. Besides going back to the air services agreement, which will result in the doubling of traffic, the two countries should look at increasing capacity under the pact, AlBanna told a group of reporters. The UAE has also asked the Indian government to exempt flights to the emirates from restrictions for the duration of the Dubai Expo 2020, which will continue till March next year, but is yet to get a “green light”, he said. The UAE is home to more than three million Indian expatriates, the largest ethnic community in the emirates comprising professionals and blue-collar workers and their families. The demand for flights has increased as a growing number of Indians are making their way back to the UAE. Dubai also serves as a key transit point for Indians travelling to other parts of the world. AlBanna noted the total weekly capacity for Dubai alone under the air services agreement was about 65,000 seats, while only 24,000 seats are currently available. The frequency of flights on the Delhi-Dubai route has dropped from five a week to three a week, he said. A clause in the air services agreement of 2007 mandates that when capacity on routes between the UAE and India touches 80%, new quotas to be shared between carriers of both countries should be re-negotiated. AlBanna noted that Indian carriers had reached 100% capacity before the pandemic. “At that time, there were at 1,068 flights a week, with around 400-plus flights by the UAE carriers and over 500 by the Indian ones. We need to re-negotiate,” he said. Two rounds of talks held in Mumbai in 2017 and New Delhi in 2019 had not been “successful in reaching a final decision on increasing capacities for the four sectors of Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah and Ras Al Khaimah”, he said. It would be to India’s benefit to end the air bubble, go back to the air services agreement and open all airports once travel restrictions are eased further, the envoy added. AlBanna said the UAE and India had recently concluded the second round of negotiations on a proposed comprehensive economic partnership agreement (CEPA) in Dubai and a third round will be held soon. Though the two sides are eyeing the completion of negotiations by March next year, AlBanna said: “I want it before March. Hopefully it will be in place. The CEPA will be a big plus point in our strategic partnership.” Referring to the first virtual meeting of the foreign ministers of India, Israel, the US and the UAE last month, AlBanna said the four countries had no plans to create a NATO-like alliance. “That doesn’t make any sense. It is an economic bloc that concentrates on economic and business collaboration between the four countries,” he said. Technical teams from the four sides are preparing for an in-person ministerial meeting. “Very soon, once that is done, the ministers will meet to discuss further sectors [of cooperation],” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uae-keen-on-speedy-restoration-of-air-services-with-india-says-envoy-101637764824322.html
24-11-2021||World||German parties reach deal for coalition govt that will end Merkel era||Three German parties have reached a deal to form a new government that will end the era of longtime Chancellor Angela Merkel, according to Olaf Scholz, who is poised to replace her.Scholz, of the center-left Social Democrats, said the new government would not seek “the lowest common denominator, but the politics of big impacts.”He stressed the importance of a sovereign Europe, friendship with France and partnership with the United States as key cornerstones of the government’s foreign policy — continuing a long post-war tradition.Scholz said he expects that members of the parties will give their blessing to the deal in the next 10 days.The Social Democrats have been negotiating with the environmentalist Green party and the pro-business Free Democrats since narrowly winning a national election on Sept. 26.If party members sign off on it, the three-way alliance — which has never yet been tried in a national government — will replace the current “grand coalition” of the country's traditional big parties. The Social Democrats have served as the junior partner to Merkel’s center-right Christian Democrats.Merkel, who didn't run for a fifth term, is expected to be succeeded by Scholz, 63, who has been her finance minister and vice chancellor since 2018.The three would-be governing parties have said they hope parliament will elect Scholz as chancellor in the week beginning Dec. 6. Before that can happen, the deal requires approval from a ballot of the Greens’ roughly 125,000-strong membership and from conventions of the other two parties.News of the deal came as Merkel led what was likely to be her last Cabinet meeting. Scholz presented the 67-year-old, who has led Germany since 2005, with a bouquet of flowers.The negotiations over the alliance were relatively harmonious and speedy compared to previous coalition talks. But the political transition, with Merkel as a lame-duck caretaker, has hampered Germany's response to the latest rise in coronavirus cases.Few details have emerged from the closed-doors talks, including how the parties will divide up the ministerial portfolios. The alliance is a potentially uneasy mixture because it brings together two traditionally left-leaning parties with one, the Free Democrats, that has tended to ally with the center-right.A preliminary agreement last month indicated that Germany would bring forward its deadline for ending the use of coal-fueled power from 2038 to 2030, while expanding the rollout of renewable energy generation.At the Free Democrats’ insistence, the prospective partners said they won’t raise taxes or loosen curbs on running up debt, making financing a central issue.Merkel's Christian Democrats are currently preoccupied with a leadership contest over who will become their next leader and revive the party's fortunes after it suffered its worst-ever election result.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-parties-reach-deal-for-coalition-govt-that-will-end-merkel-era-101637763867855.html
24-11-2021||World||Thai activists iPhones may have been targeted: Apple||Apple Inc issued on Wednesday alert messages to at least six Thai activists and researchers who have been critical of the government, warning it believed their iPhones had been targeted by "state-sponsored attackers", according to activists and the alerts reviewed by Reuters.Apple and Thailand's Digital Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Prajak Kongkirati, a political scientist at Bangkok's Thammasat University, said he had received two emails from Apple warning it believed his iPhone and iCloud accounts had been targeted, along with a "threat notification" on his Apple account.Researcher Sarinee Achananuntakul and Thai activist Yingcheep Atchanont of Legal Monitoring group iLaw said they had received similar emails, while a rapper, a political activist, and a politician opposed to the government separately posted screenshots of the same email on their social media accounts.All are perceived as being critical of the Thai government.The messages warned "if your device is compromised by a state-sponsored attacker, they may be able to remotely access your sensitive data, communications, or even the camera and microphone."Apple on Tuesday filed a lawsuit against Israeli cyber firm NSO Group and its parent company OSY Technologies for alleged surveillance and targeting of US Apple users with its Pegasus spyware. In a statement on Tuesday, Apple said that the NSO group had created "state-sponsored surveillance technology" that had been aimed at "very small number of users".It was not immediately clear in Apple's alerts on Wednesday whether the company believed Thais were being targeted by Pegasus.Internet security watchdog group Citizen Lab identified in 2018 a Pegasus spyware operator active within Thailand.Thailand's government is still led by the architects of a 2014 coup, who remain in power after a 2019 election that its rivals say was stacked in the military's favour.Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, the coup leader, has denied the claims, but has faced months of anti-government protests.As well as calls for greater democracy, the government has also been criticised over its management of the coronavirus pandemic and the economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thai-activists-iphones-may-have-been-targeted-apple-101637759332541.html
24-11-2021||World||Germany's Angela Merkel set to hand off power||She was called "the leader of the free world" against authoritarian populists on the march in Europe and the United States, but Angela Merkel is wrapping up a historic 16 years in power with a mixed legacy at home and abroad.In office so long she was dubbed Germany's "eternal chancellor", Merkel, 67, leaves with her popularity so resilient she would likely have won a record fifth term had she sought it.Instead, Merkel will pass the baton as the first German chancellor to step down entirely by choice, with a whole generation of voters never knowing another person at the top.Her supporters say she provided steady leadership through countless global crises as a moderate and unifying figure.Yet critics argue a muddle-through style pegged to the broadest possible consensus lacked the bold vision to prepare Europe and its top economy for the coming decades.What is certain is that she leaves behind a fractured political landscape, with her own CDU party divided as it struggles to emerge from her long shadow.Social Democrat Olaf Scholz, who served as her vice chancellor and finance minister, successfully sold himself as the Merkel continuity candidate in the run-up to September's general election and is now poised to succeed her.Scholz's SPD was set to unveil later Wednesday a coalition deal with Greens and liberal Free Democrats. Assuming the government takes over in early December, Merkel will fall just days short of beating Helmut Kohl's record as Germany's longest-serving post-war leader.- Do the right thing -The unflappable Merkel has served for many in recent years as a multilateralist counterweight to the big, brash men of global politics, from Donald Trump to Vladimir Putin.A Pew Research Center poll in September showed large majorities in most democracies around the globe having "confidence in Merkel to do the right thing in world affairs".A trained quantum chemist raised behind the Iron Curtain, Merkel was long in sync with her change-averse electorate as a guarantor of stability.Her major policy shifts reflected the wishes of large German majorities -- among them phasing out nuclear power after the 2011 Fukushima disaster -- and attracted a broad new coalition of women and urban voters to the once arch-conservative CDU.However, the last days of her tenure have been marred by a vicious fourth wave of the coronavirus outbreak, the worst since the start of the pandemic.- 'Austerity queen' -Before the pandemic, her boldest move -- keeping open German borders in 2015 to more than one million asylum seekers -- seemed set to determine her legacy.But while many Germans rallied to Merkel's "We can do it" cry, the move also emboldened an anti-migrant party, Alternative for Germany (AfD), ushering a far-right bloc into parliament for the first time since World War II.The woman once known as the "climate chancellor" for pushing renewables also faces a mass movement of young activists arguing she has failed to face up to the climate emergency, with Germany not even meeting its own emissions reduction commitments.The incoming coalition has pledged to improve on that legacy, and to take a more assertive stance with Russia and China after the commerce-based pragmatism of the Merkel years. Merkel became Europe's go-to leader during the eurozone crisis when Berlin championed swinging spending cuts in return for international bailout loans for debt-mired countries.Angry protesters dubbed her Europe's "austerity queen" and caricatured her in Nazi garb, while defenders credit her with holding the currency union together. - Kohl's 'girl' to 'Mummy' -Merkel, the EU's and G7's most senior leader, started as a contemporary of George W. Bush, Tony Blair and Jacques Chirac when she became Germany's youngest and first female chancellor in 2005.She was born Angela Dorothea Kasner on July 17, 1954 in the port city of Hamburg, the daughter of a Lutheran clergyman and a schoolteacher.Her father moved the family to a small-town parish in the communist East at a time when tens of thousands were headed the other way.She excelled in mathematics and Russian, which has helped her maintain the dialogue with the other veteran on the world stage, Russia's Putin, who was a KGB officer in Dresden when the Berlin Wall fell in 1989.Merkel kept the name of her first husband, whom she married in 1977 and divorced five years later.After the fall of the wall, Merkel, who was working in a chemistry lab, joined a pro-democracy group that would merge with Kohl's Christian Democrats.The Protestant from the East whom Kohl nicknamed his "girl" would later be elected leader of a party until then dominated by western Catholic patriarchs.As she rose to power, party rivals sneeringly called her "Mutti" (Mummy) behind her back but she deftly -- some said ruthlessly -- eliminated potential challengers.Although her name has come up on wish lists for key EU or United Nations posts, Merkel has said she will leave politics altogether.Asked on her final trip to Washington in June what she looked forward to most, she replied "not having to constantly make decisions".bur-dlc/hmn/rl||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germanys-angela-merkel-set-to-hand-off-power-101637758424577.html
24-11-2021||World||Pakistan informs India about allowing shipment of 50,000 tonnes of wheat for Afghanistan||Pakistan formally informed India on Wednesday that it will allow the shipment of 50,000 tonnes of wheat and life-saving medicines from India to Afghanistan via the Wagah land border as a goodwill gesture to the Afghan people. India’s offer to supply wheat and other essential items as humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan had been pending for more than a month as Pakistan had not cleared the transportation of the relief materials via land routes. There are currently no flights between India and Afghanistan, and transporting the materials via Pakistan was being seen as the quickest way of getting the aid to Afghanistan, which is on the brink of a looming humanitarian crisis. The Pakistan government’s decision was formally conveyed to the charge d’affaires of the Indian high commission in Islamabad at the foreign ministry, according to an official statement from the Pakistani side. “As a goodwill gesture towards the brotherly Afghan people, the Government of Pakistan has decided to allow the transportation of 50,000 Metric Tonnes of wheat and lifesaving medicines from India to Afghanistan via Wagah Border on an exceptional basis for humanitarian purposes,” the statement said. The announcement was more of a formality as Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan had said on Monday his government would allow the transportation of the wheat offered by India to Afghanistan as soon as modalities were finalised by Islamabad and New Delhi. Even a Taliban delegation that recently visited Islamabad had raised the issue of allowing the shipment of the wheat with the top Pakistani leadership. The UN has warned that up to 23 million Afghans will be in “crisis or emergency levels of food insecurity” as winter approaches. Ten out of 11 of Afghanistan’s most densely populated urban areas are now anticipated to be at emergency levels of food insecurity.Khan made the announcement while approving a humanitarian assistance package for Afghanistan. He also said Pakistan will facilitate the return of Afghan nationals who had gone to India for medical treatment and were stuck there. Hundreds of Afghan nationals, including patients seeking medical treatment and their relatives or attendants, have been stranded in India for months following the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in mid-August. In recent weeks, some of them made their way back to Afghanistan via Iran on a handful of specially arranged flights. However, the fare for this route was $850 and out of the reach of many of the stranded Afghans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-informs-india-about-allowing-shipment-of-50-000-tonnes-of-wheat-for-afghanistan-101637758103815.html

In early October, India reached out to Pakistan to dispatch the consignment via the Wagah-Attari border near Amritsar in Punjab, but it hit hurdles because of India-Pakistan rivalry for which commercial and transport links between India and Pakistan are suspended for years. A Taliban delegation that recently visited Islamabad had raised the issue of allowing the shipment via land.The development comes after Pakistan skips India's regional NSA-level summit to discuss Afghanistan post the Taliban takeover. With Iran, Russia, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan attending the summit, it was declared by the eight countries that Afghanistan's territory must not be used for terror activities. Slamming Pakistan for staying away from the meeting, New Delhi said it showed their attitude over Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-says-its-nod-to-india-s-shipment-for-afghanistan-is-on-exceptional-basis-101637749200375.html
24-11-2021||World||China slams US for inviting Taiwan to democracy summit||China on Wednesday slammed the US decision to invite Taiwan to a democracy summit in December, calling the decision a “mistake” and asking Washington not to collude with Taiwan “independence” separatists.“China firmly opposes the US invitation to the Taiwan authorities to participate in the so-called Summit for Democracy,” said foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian, adding that Taiwan is “an inalienable part of Chinese territory”.China reacted after the Joe Biden administration officially released the list of participants to its upcoming “summit for democracy”, which includes the island of Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy claimed by Beijing as a breakaway region.The invitation comes days after President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Biden held a video summit where the Chinese President warned Biden that encouraging Taiwanese independence would be “playing with fire”.There are 110 participants on the US state department’s invitation list for the virtual event on December 9 and 10 including India but not China and Russia.The summit, according to Washington, aims to help stop democratic backsliding and the erosion of rights and freedoms worldwide.The naming of Taiwan has expectedly riled China, which has in recent months increased pressure on the island and accused the US of working with those who propagate “independence” for it.Beijing has never ruled out using force to reunify the island of some 23 million people. Reacting to Taiwan being included in the summit, the mainland’s State Council Taiwan Affairs Office said “it’s a mistake” and reiterated its firm opposition to any formal interaction between the US and the island.“We firmly oppose any form of official interaction between the US and the island, which is a clear and consistent stance,” Zhu Fenglian, spokesperson of the Taiwan Affairs Office said on Wednesday, adding that the way the US listed Taiwan as a participant at the summit “…is a mistake”.The Chinese foreign ministry expressed strong opposition against Taiwan being invited to the “so-called summit of democracy” with spokesperson Zhao Lijian urging the US to stop colluding with Taiwan “independence” separatists.Zhao added that “…there is only one China in the world, and the government of the People’s Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China”.“Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory and the one-China principle. It is a generally accepted norm of international relations. Apart from being part of China, Taiwan has no other status in international law,” Zhao said.During the presidential summit with Xi Jinping, Biden had reiterated long-standing US support for the “One China” policy under which it officially recognises Beijing rather than Taipei.But, according to the White House, Biden had also said he “strongly opposes unilateral efforts to change the status quo or undermine peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait”.Xi, according to the official news agency, Xinhua, said that those in Taiwan who seek independence, and their supporters in the US, were “playing with fire”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-slams-us-for-inviting-taiwan-to-democracy-summit-101637745144175.html
24-11-2021||World||Canada: Justin Trudeau govt to focus on economic growth, climate crisis||As Canada’s parliament formally opened on Tuesday following the September elections, the minority government headed by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau presented an agenda focused on putting the Covid-19 pandemic “behind” and priorities like economic growth and tackling record inflation, climate crisis and reconciliation with the Indigenous communities.The outline of what Justin Trudeau plans to achieve in the near future was presented by Canada’s governor-general Mary Simon in her Speech from the Throne, which is equivalent to the Indian President’s address to the nation. The speech is so named as the governor-general (GG) is the representative of the Queen Elizabeth II, Canada’s head of state.The speech will be debated in the House of Commons in the days ahead and could result in the new government facing its first vote of confidence, as it will require the support of either the opposition Bloc Quebecois or the New Democratic Party (NDP) to get it passed. Trudeau’s ruling Liberal Party is 10 short of the 170 seats required for a majority.“Priority number one remains getting the pandemic under control. The best way to do that is vaccination,” the GG said. In a statement related to the speech, Trudeau referred to the snap elections in September and said voters “gave parliamentarians a clear direction to work together to put the Covid-19 crisis behind us and find the real solutions needed to build a better future for all Canadians.”“Building a better future starts with getting the pandemic under control and finishing the job on vaccines,” the statement issued by the prime minister’s office noted.The speech began with a reference to the devastating flooding that beset the province of British Columbia last week. “The Canadian government will continue to invest in our workers and industry to help bring us into the economy of the future, while also taking action to clean the air that we breathe and protect Canadians from extreme weather events,” Trudeau said.The speech reiterated Canada’s COP26 commitment that it was “moving to cap and cut oil and gas sector emissions, while accelerating” its “path to a 100% net-zero electricity future”.With inflation at a level of nearly 5%, a high not experienced in the country for two decades, that, along with affordability, was among the main matters addressed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-justin-trudeau-govt-to-focus-on-economic-growth-climate-crisis-101637736682101.html
24-11-2021||World||Biden taps oil from US strategic petroleum reserve. Here's all you need to know||When President Joe Biden ordered the release of 50 million barrels of oil from America’s strategic reserve to help reduce energy costs, he was taking aim at a growing burden for millions of Americans embarking on Thanksgiving travel.The step announced Tuesday, done in rare coordination with several other nations, is among the few things a presidential administration can do to try to lessen the squeeze — and the political threat — of rising inflation. The likelihood of providing meaningful relief in the near future, however, is probably low. Still, any help in easing fuel prices, even modestly, would be welcomed by many Americans.Here is a look at what's involved:Just what is the petroleum reserve?America’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve holds about 605 million barrels of oil in underground salt caverns in Texas and Louisiana. It was created following the 1970s Arab oil embargo to store oil that could be tapped in an emergency. But the dynamics of the global oil industry changed dramatically in recent years: Now the US exports more oil than it imports.There’s a limit to how much can be released at once. In the past, the government has released about 1 million barrels per day. At that rate, the promised influx of 50 million barrels of crude could last about two months.Why did Biden tap the reserve?The idea is that by putting more oil on the market, prices will fall. That hasn’t happened yet. But depending on what happens in the rest of the world, there’s still a chance it could work.Oil prices rose slightly after the announcement. Traders were anticipating the news, and may have been underwhelmed by the details, said Claudio Galimberti, senior vice president for oil markets at Rystad Energy.“The immediate price reaction is not the final judgment on the effectiveness of this effort,” said Jim Burkhard, vice president at IHS Markit. “It will really be in the months ahead.”Whether the move is effective depends on several factors.What about OPEC?The OPEC oil cartel and its allies will be meeting in about a week to decide whether to increase production or to hold back, a strategy the group often employs to boost prices. Earlier this month, Biden had hoped OPEC nations, led by Saudi Arabia, would agree to significantly boost production. But they only made modest increases.If OPEC decides next week that it wants higher prices, its members could take oil off the market. “Just overnight, they could just offset it,” Burkhard said. “So that’s a big question mark, is how they react to this.”The coalition Biden assembled — bringing together India, China, Japan, South Korea and the U.K. to tap their strategic oil reserves — is unprecedented, Galimberti said. Altogether, the group could be adding 70 million to 80 million barrels of oil onto the market, he estimates.“It’s kind of a coalition of oil importers,” he added. “But can they really supplant, or can they really represent a rival to OPEC-plus? The answer is absolutely not.” That’s because the group of importers are using their strategic petroleum reserves, which are limited. On the other hand, OPEC and its allies have oil reserves that can last for decades. “So there is no comparison between the two,” Galimberti said.Will gasoline get cheaper?What many consumers want to know is what’s going to happen to gasoline prices at the pump. Many factors go into the price of gasoline. Refineries buy crude oil in advance, so they’re still working with more expensive oil, and states have differing tax rates that impact the price. Nevertheless, if OPEC doesn’t respond by curtailing production, the influx of oil could lead to a gasoline price decrease of 10 cents to 15 cents per gallon, said Kevin Book, managing director at Clearview Energy Partners. Even if the price drop doesn’t happen, Biden can make the case that he tried.“Really, what we’re talking about are the most price-sensitive consumers in the economy,” Book said. “They may not show up in GDP numbers or recessions, but they show up in vote counts as marginal voters, who may or may not respond in the next election cycle, and I think if we get down to it that’s really what this is about.”Why does oil matter?The future of oil and gas in the US is a political flashpoint and source of tension, especially as companies and government agencies grapple with climate change and the transition to cleaner sources of energy.On the one hand, the US oil and gas industry has been praised by some political leaders for creating energy independence. Where the US once relied heavily on imports, other nations now rely on the US for oil. It's also a job supplier: The oil and gas industry employs more than 10 million people in the US and contributes about 8% of the nation’s gross domestic product, according to the American Petroleum Institute. Any impact resulting from Biden's release of oil from the strategic reserves “is likely to be short-lived unless it is paired with policy measures that encourage the production of American energy resources,” the API said in a statement.Companies that supply oil benefit from higher prices. But consumers don’t like it when those higher prices trickle down to the pump.“The broader drama is this new variable in the oil market: It’s the tension between aspirations to decarbonize and the practical concern to have low gasoline prices,” Burkhard said. “And there there’s a conflict between those two forces. And that’s why we’re going to continue to see dislocations between demand and supply.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-taps-oil-from-us-strategic-petroleum-reserve-here-s-all-you-need-to-know-101637734142231.html
24-11-2021||World||Canada: Justin Trudeau government formulates new Indo-Pacific strategy||As Canada formulates a new strategy for the Indo-Pacific, the region will be a key component of its foreign affairs policy as evidenced by its mention in the agenda before the new parliament.As the House of Commons met for the first time after the September elections, Canada’s governor-general Mary Simon outlined the policy priorities of the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and among those was “making deliberate efforts to deepen partnerships in the Indo-Pacific”.The outlet Globe and Mail reported earlier this month the Global Affairs Canada, the country’s foreign ministry, is working on a new policy for the Indo-Pacific. A spokesperson for Canada’s new foreign minister Melanie Joly told them that it will comprise “a new integrated approach to the Indo-Pacific region with a view to diversifying Canada’s engagement and deepening its diplomatic, economic, security and sustainable development partnerships”.The special secretariat tasked with developing the policy is being headed by veteran diplomat Jonathan Fried.Canada has also had discussions with India in recent times about the region. In fact, Fried recently met India’s high commissioner Ajay Bisaria in Ottawa.Last week, in her keynote address to the Halifax International Security Forum, Canada’s new defence minister Anita Anand said, “In the Indo-Pacific, Canadian military ships, aircraft, and sailors maintain a solid presence.” She added that “through Operation Projection, Canadian warships work in lockstep with our partners to maintain a meaningful, and interoperable, allied presence in the Indo-Pacific region and around the world”, referring, in this context, to a recent “sail-through in the Taiwanese strait” in October.Pressure has been increasing on Canada to be more assertive in the region even as the threat posed by China increases. This matter was also discussed when Trudeau met US President Joe Biden in Washington earlier this month.Also speaking at the Halifax Forum, North America’s premier event related to global security, Admiral John Aquilino, commander of the United States Indo-Pacific Command, argued that the world’s “military and economic centres of gravity have shifted to the Indo-Pacific”.This new reality was reflected in the speech delivered by Canada’s governor-general on Tuesday. Without mentioning China, Mary Simon said, “In the face of rising authoritarianism and great power competition, Canada must reinforce international peace and security, the rule of law, democracy, and respect for human rights.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-justin-trudeau-government-formulates-new-indo-pacific-strategy-101637733321842.html
24-11-2021||World||Does vaccination protect against long Covid? Here’s what studies suggest||It’s been nearly two years that coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic began across the globe. While multiple vaccines with high efficacy rate are currently available, their protection capability in the face of varied threats posed by the virus remains somewhat ambiguous. One such threat is long Covid or post-acute sequelae SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC).According to WebMD, long Covid can be defined as having lingering symptoms of the infection weeks or even months after one starts to recover from it. A recent study by researchers of University of Michigan revealed that over 40 per cent of Covid-19 survivors around the world are estimated to have suffered from long Covid.Does vaccination protect against long Covid?Although vaccination helps against the virus, experts believe that it doesn’t curtail the risk of long Covid. According to a report in Nature, physiotherapist David Putrino said a dozen of his clients experienced long Covid from ‘breakthrough infections’ wherein vaccinated individuals catch the infection.One of the causes of long Covid is the broad immune response triggered by the initial infection, which can produce antibodies and several other immunological reactions against the body’s own tissues. Researchers and data suggested that vaccination could only decrease the likelihood of this scenario, and also that protection against long Covid is partial.Also Read | Long Covid has more than 200 symptoms across 10 organ systems: StudyOne of the largest studies gathered so far from 1.2 million people, who were inoculated with at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine, found that a full-two dose of vaccination decreased the risk of long Covid by about half among those who had breakthrough infections. However, the Nature journal report noted, the study constituted more men than women, and fewer individuals from the lower-income regions.Is it possible to know the extent and of long Covid’s risk?Immunologist Petter Brodin at Stockholm’s Karolinska Institute said that determining the risk of long Covid from breakthrough infections is challenging as several people with mild or asymptomatic infections may not even be tested for Covid-19, according to the Nature report.Also Read | Blood clotting may be root cause of long Covid syndrome? Here's what study says“Doing any kind of assessment of how many people develop long-term symptoms after they are vaccinated is going to be incredibly difficult,” he added.What remains unknown regarding the interlink between vaccine and long Covid?A large study, yet to be peer reviewed, revealed that vaccination didn’t protect against multiple conditions related to long Covid. In reference to this, immunologist Akiko Iwasaki at Yale University in Connecticut, said that results of these studies are disappointing.“I honestly thought the vaccine would protect against long Covid much more extensively,” she said.With vaccination programmes continuing, researchers will gain a better insight into the mechanism of vaccines and variants that affect long Covid rates and severity. For example, in October, the UK branch for the National Statistics, which is assembling data on long Covid, reported that the first shot of the Covid-19 vaccine was associated with 13 per cent decrease in self-reported long Covid symptoms among those who already had the condition. Meanwhile, the second jab produced an additional 9 per cent drop relative to the first.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/does-vaccination-protect-against-long-covid-here-s-what-studies-suggest-101637726260640.html

24-11-2021||World||NASA launches spacecraft to kick an asteroid off course||NASA is preparing a mission to deliberately smash a spacecraft into an asteroid -- a test run should humanity ever need to stop a giant space rock from wiping out life on Earth.It may sound like the stuff of science fiction, but the DART (Double Asteroid Redirection Test) is a real proof-of-concept experiment, blasting off at 10:21 pm Pacific Time Tuesday (0621 GMT Wednesday) aboard a SpaceX rocket from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California."All systems and weather are looking good for tonight's Falcon 9 launch," Elon Musk's company tweeted.The goal is to slightly alter the trajectory of Dimorphos, a "moonlet" around 525 feet (160 meters, or two Statues of Liberty) wide that circles a much larger asteroid called Didymos (2,500 feet in diameter). The pair orbit the Sun together.Impact should take place in the fall of 2022, when the binary asteroid system is 6.8 million miles (11 million kilometers) from Earth, almost the nearest point they ever get. "What we're trying to learn is how to deflect a threat," NASA's top scientist Thomas Zuburchen said of the $330 million project, the first of its kind.To be clear, the asteroids in question pose no threat to our planet. But they belong to a class of bodies known as Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) -- asteroids and comets that approach within 30 million miles.NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office is most interested in those larger than 460 feet in size, which have the potential to level entire cities or regions with many times the energy of average nuclear bombs.There are 10,000 known near-Earth asteroids 460 feet in size or greater, but none has a significant chance to hit in the next 100 years. One major caveat: scientists think there are still 15,000 more such objects waiting to be discovered.- 15,000 mph kick -Planetary scientists can create miniature impacts in labs and use the results to create sophisticated models about how to divert an asteroid -- but models are always inferior to real world tests.Scientists say the Didymos-Dimorphos system is an "ideal natural laboratory," because Earth-based telescopes can easily measure the brightness variation of the pair and judge the time it takes the moonlet to orbit its big brother.Since the current orbit period is known, the change will reveal the effect of the impact, scheduled to occur between September 26 and October 1, 2022.What's more, since the asteroids' orbit never intersects our planet, they are thought safer to study.The DART probe, which is a box the size of a large fridge with limousine-sized solar panels on either side, will slam into Dimorphos at just over 15,000 miles an hour.Andy Rivkin, DART investigation team lead, said that the current orbital period is 11 hours and 55 minutes, and the team expects the kick will shave around 10 minutes off that time.There is some uncertainty about how much energy will be transferred by the impact, because the moonlet's internal composition and porosity are not known.The more debris that's generated, the more push will be imparted on Dimorphos."Every time we show up at an asteroid, we find stuff we don't expect," said Rivkin.The DART spacecraft also contains sophisticated instruments for navigation and imaging, including the Italian Space Agency's Light Italian CubeSat for Imaging of Asteroids (LICIACube) to watch the crash and its after-effects.- Nuclear blasts - The so-called "kinetic impactor" method isn't the only way to divert an asteroid, but it is the only technique ready to deploy with current technology.Others that have been hypothesized include flying a spacecraft close by to impart a small gravitational force. Another is detonating a nuclear blast close by -- but not on the object itself, as in the films Armageddon and Deep Impact -- which would probably create many more perilous objects.Scientists estimate 460-foot asteroids strike once every 20,000 years.Asteroids that are six miles or wider -- such as the one that struck 66 million years ago and led to the extinction of most life on Earth, including the dinosaurs -- occur around every 100-200 million years.ia/dw||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasa-launches-spacecraft-to-kick-an-asteroid-off-course-101637715818294.html
24-11-2021||World||Waukesha Christmas parade crash: Child 6th victim in incident, suspect charged||An 8-year-old boy became the sixth person to die Tuesday as a result of a man driving his SUV into a suburban Milwaukee Christmas parade, with a criminal complaint alleging that the suspect in the case steered side-to-side with the intent of striking marchers and spectators.Darrell Brooks Jr., 39, was charged with five counts of first-degree intentional homicide, a charge that carries a mandatory life sentence if convicted. He rocked back and forth in his seat and cried throughout his court hearing on Tuesday, his attorney’s arm on his back, as the charges against him were detailed. His bail was set at $5 million, and a preliminary hearing was scheduled for Jan. 14.“The nature of this offense is shocking," said Waukesha Court Commissioner Kevin Costello.Additional charges related to the sixth death and the more than 60 people injured will be coming later this week or next, said Waukesha County District Attorney Susan Opper. The criminal complaint said 62 people were injured, up from the 48 previously announced by police.Brooks is accused of speeding away from police and entering the Waukesha Christmas parade on Sunday night, refusing to stop even as an officer banged on the hood of his SUV. Another officer fired three shots into the vehicle, but it did not stop.Five people ranging in age from 52 to 81 were pronounced dead within hours. Jackson Sparks, 8, was the first of many injured children to have died. He was walking in the parade with his 12-year-old brother Tucker, who was injured and is being discharged from the hospital, according to his GoFundMe page.“This afternoon, our dear Jackson has sadly succumbed to his injuries and passed away,” the page’s organizer, Alyssa Albro, wrote.The city’s livestream video and bystander video captured the chaotic scene when an SUV sped along the parade route and then into the crowd. Several of those injured remain in critical condition.According to the criminal complaint, witnesses told police that the vehicle “appeared to be intentionally moving side to side,” with no attempt to slow down or stop as it struck multiple people and sent bodies and objects flying.Brooks ignored several attempts to stop him, according to the criminal complaint.A detective — wearing police insignia and a neon orange safety vest — stepped in front of Brooks’ vehicle and pounded on the hood, shouting “Stop,” several times but Brooks drove past him, according to the complaint.A uniformed police officer who saw Brooks’ SUV traveling toward the parade route also tried to get his attention, yelling “Stop, stop the vehicle” several times but was ignored, according to the complaint. The officer “observed the driver looking straight ahead, directly at him, and it appeared he had no emotion on his face,” the complaint said.Brooks braked at one point, but instead of turning away from the parade route, he turned into the crowd and appeared to rapidly accelerate, the complaint said.Another police officer shot at the vehicle, striking it three times as it entered the parade route. Brooks was not hit by the bullets, the Waukesha police chief said Monday.The complaint said one witness who spoke with police said the SUV "continued to drive in a zig zag motion. It was like the SUV was trying to avoid vehicles, not people. There was no attempt made by the vehicle to stop, much less slow down.”Waukesha Police Chief Dan Thompson said Brooks, 39, was leaving the scene of a domestic dispute that had taken place just minutes earlier when he drove into the parade route.He had been free on $1,000 bail for a case in Milwaukee County earlier in November in which he’s accused of intentionally striking a woman with his car. Prosecutors said they’re investigating their bail recommendation in that case, calling it inappropriately low.“We have a gentleman that has a huge background, via multiple states,” Costello said.Brooks has been charged with crimes more than a dozen times since 1999, mostly in Wisconsin but also in Georgia and Nevada, and had two outstanding cases against him at the time of the parade disaster. That included resisting or obstructing an officer, reckless endangering, disorderly conduct, bail jumping and battery for the Nov. 2 incident.Thompson said that there was no evidence the bloodshed Sunday was a terrorist attack or that Brooks knew anyone in the parade. Brooks acted alone, the chief said.NBC News published doorbell camera footage that appeared to capture Brooks' arrest. It showed Brooks, shivering in just a T-shirt, knocking on a homeowner's door and asking for help calling for a ride. Moments later, police surrounded the house and shouted, “Hands up!” Brooks, standing on the porch, held up his hands and said, “Whoa whoa whoa!”Hundreds gathered at a downtown park Monday night in Waukesha, Wisconsin, for a candlelight vigil in honor of those lost and hurt. A pair of clergy solemnly read the names of those who died. Volunteers handed out sandwiches, hot chocolate and candles at the vigil, which was attended by interfaith leaders and elected officials.“We are parents. We are neighbors. We are hurting. We are angry. We are sad. We are confused. We are thankful. We are all in this together. We are Waukesha Strong,” said a tearful Amanda Medina Roddy with the Waukesha school district.Mayor Shawn Reilly described the parade as a “Norman Rockwell-type” event that “became a nightmare.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/waukesha-christmas-parade-crash-child-6th-victim-in-incident-suspect-charged-101637714488928.html

24-11-2021||World||Einstein's manuscript, with sketches of relativity theory, sold for $13 million||A manuscript co-authored by Albert Einstein, offering a rare insight into the legendary physicist's thinking leading up to his general theory of relativity, was sold in an auction on Tuesday for 11.7 million euros ($13.17 million).Auction house Christie's had estimated the value of the manuscript at between 2 million and 3 million euros.The 54 pages of paper, around half-filled with Einstein's handwriting, are one of only two working documents known in which the thinker approaches his famous theory that laid the groundwork for modern cosmology and technology such as GPS navigation.They had been kept in the custody of the Swiss physicist Michele Besso, a close friend and academic partner of Einstein's, who co-authored the work between 1913 and 1914."That's also what makes it particularly important given that working documents by Einstein before 1919 are extremely rare," said Vincent Belloy, an expert at Christie's who hosted the auction in Paris."Einstein is someone who kept very few notes, so the mere fact that the manuscript survived and made its way to us already makes it absolutely extraordinary," he added.Made up mainly of endless calculations in black ink on wrinkled, lightly yellowed paper, the manuscript challenges Einstein's popular image as an absolute genius, because it shows that even he - at least sometimes - made mistakes."Einstein makes errors in this manuscript, and that I think makes it even greater in a way, because we see the persistence, the thought that was in the process of being built, that is being corrected and redirected," Belloy said.In May, a handwritten letter in which Einstein mentioned his famous E=mc² equation, a part of his earlier theory of special relativity, was sold at roughly one million euros in the United States, more than three times its estimated price.With his general theory of relativity that was published in 1915, Einstein revolutionised modern physics when he first described gravitation as a geometric warping of space and time, a finding that remains valid.Christie's did not reveal the name of the buyer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/einsteins-manuscript-with-sketches-of-relativity-theory-sold-for-13-million-101637713719876.html

They had suffered burns and one had a broken leg.The accident happened on the Struma highway about 30km west of Sofia around 2am local time.North Macedonia’s chief prosecutor, Lubomir Jovevski, who visited the scene of the accident, said that 12 children were confirmed among the dead.The cause of the crash was not immediately confirmed, but it appeared that the bus hit a highway guard rail, crashed and caught fire.Bulgarian investigative service chief Borislav Sarafov said four buses from a North Macedonian travel agency had entered Bulgaria late on Monday from Turkey. “Human error by the driver or a technical malfunction are the two initial versions for the accident,” he said.Photos taken shortly after the crash showed the bus engulfed in flames with plumes of smoke rising from the scene. Daylight revealed the burned-out bus, its windows all broken, charred and gutted, sitting upright against the median barrier.Interior minister Boyko Rashkov told reporters at the crash site that he had “never in my life seen something more horrifying”. “The picture is horrifying, the people who were on the bus are turned to charcoal,” Rashkov said. “It is impossible to say how many they were. There were four buses that travelled together, and it is possible that passengers changed buses during the stops.”Media in North Macedonia, a country of about 2 million people, said that police were outside the Skopje offices of a travel company that is believed to have organized the trip to Turkey.Bulgarian caretaker Prime Minister Stefan Yanev, who also visited the site of the crash, said it was “a huge tragedy”.“I take this opportunity to send my condolences to the relatives of the victims,” Yanev said. “Let’s hope we learn lessons and we can prevent such incidents in the future.”Albanian Foreign Minister Olta Xhacka wrote online that almost all of those who died in the crash were ethnic Albanians.North Macedonia’s prime minister, Zoran Zaev, arrived in Bulgaria to visit the survivors in the hospital in person.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bus-crashes-catches-fire-in-bulgaria-at-least-46-killed-101637698227695.html
24-11-2021||World||Merck asks EU drug regulator to authorise its Covid-19 pill||The European Medicines Agency said it has received a request from Merck to authorise its coronavirus antiviral, the first pill shown to treat Covid-19.In a statement Tuesday, the EU drug regulator said it had started evaluating molnupiravir, made by Merck and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, and that a decision could be made within weeks on whether it might be cleared.Last week, the EMA issued emergency advice saying that molnupiravir could be used to treat adults infected with the coronavirus who don't yet need extra oxygen and are at increased risk of developing severe disease.The agency said the drug should be given as soon as possible after Covid-19 has been diagnosed and within five days of symptoms starting.It is intended to be taken twice a day for five days.Earlier this month, Britain became the first country in the world to OK the drug.The UK licensed molnupiravir for adults diagnosed with Covid-19 and with at least one risk factor for severe disease.An antiviral pill that reduces symptoms and speeds recovery could prove groundbreaking, easing caseloads on hospitals and helping to curb explosive outbreaks in conjunction with vaccination campaigns.Europe is now at the epicenter of the pandemic and the World Health Organisation has warned that without urgent measures, Europe could see 700,000 more Covid-19 deaths by the spring.Molnupiravir is also pending review with regulators in the US, which is expected to convene an expert panel later this month to consider authorisation.Even if the pill is licensed, initial supplies will be limited. Merck has said it can produce 10 million treatment courses this year, but much of that supply has already been purchased by governments worldwide.In October, Merck agreed to let other drugmakers produce molnupiravir and signed a licensing agreement with the UN-backed Medicines Patent Pool allowing its pill to be made by companies in dozens of countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/merck-asks-eu-drug-regulator-to-authorise-its-covid-19-pill-101637691488046.html

That, he said, was 2.5 times more than the same period last year.Shoigu complained in particular of what he said was a simulated US nuclear strike against Russia earlier this month."The defence minister underlined that during the US military exercises 'Global Thunder', 10 American strategic bombers rehearsed launching nuclear weapons against Russia from the western and eastern directions," Shoigu was quoted as saying in a defence ministry statement."The minimum proximity to our state border was 20 km."Shoigu was quoted as saying that Russian air defence units had spotted and tracked the US strategic bombers and taken unspecified measures to avoid any incidents.Global Thunder, which this year put US nuclear-capable B-52 bombers through their paces, is the US Strategic Command's annual nuclear and command exercise designed to test and demonstrate the readiness of US nuclear capabilities.President Vladimir Putin referenced the apparent episode briefly last week, complaining of Western strategic bombers carrying "very serious weapons" close to Russia. He said the West was taking Moscow's warnings not to cross its "red lines" too lightly.Shoigu made the comments in a video conference with Chinese Defence Minister Wei Fenghe. He said that US bomber flights close to Russia's eastern borders were also a threat to China."Against this backdrop, Russo-Chinese coordination is becoming a stabilising factor in world affairs," said Shoigu.Russia and China agreed at the meeting to step up cooperation between their armed forces when it came to strategic military exercises and joint patrols, the defence ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moscow-says-us-rehearsed-nuclear-strike-against-russia-in-november-report-101637688011310.html

New Delhi has ordered the release of 5 million barrels from the reserve and other countries will make their respective announcements.“American consumers are feeling the impact of elevated gas prices at the pump and in their home heating bills, and American businesses are, too, because oil supply has not kept up with demand as the global economy emerges from the pandemic,” the White House said in the announcement, adding, “That’s why President Biden is using every tool available to him to work to lower prices and address the lack of supply.”Gas at the pump is selling at an average of $3.40 a gallon (3.8 litres), with prices going up to $4.70 in California, according to the Automobile Associations of America. Tuesday’s national average of $3.40 is 3 cents more than a month ago and $1.29 more than a year ago - when oil prices had nosedived because of slump in demand caused by Covid-19 lockdowns - in the wake of and 81 cents more than in 2019.The release from the reserve is expected to hit the pump middle or late December.President Biden had been under mounting pressure from Republicans and from with his own democratic party to use the reserve to tackle the rising oil prices, especially in view of the holiday season that starts with Thanksgiving later this week, when Americans are expected to hit the roadThe US Strategic Petroleum Reserve is a stockpile of gas meant to be used during emergencies such as a war or a hurricane. It was created after the oil crisis of the 1970s. The oil is stored in underground salt caverns in Texas and Louisiana, which together are reported to hold more than 600 million barrels, which is slightly less than a month’s requirement.The President has been working with countries across the world to address the lack of supply as the world exits the pandemic. “As a result of President Biden’s leadership and our diplomatic efforts, this release will be taken in parallel with other major energy consuming nations including China, India, Japan, Republic of Korea and the United Kingdom,” the White House said. “This culminates weeks of consultations with countries around the world, and we are already seeing the effect of this work on oil prices. Over the last several weeks as reports of this work became public, oil prices are down nearly 10%.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-taps-oil-stockpile-in-parallel-with-india-china-and-others-101637688114670.html

It was trading at 12.51 against the dollar in the late afternoon — down 9.9% from Monday’s close. The currency was trading at 14.08 against the euro. The lira has lost some 40% of its value since the start of the year.Erdogan, who had declared himself an “enemy” of high borrowing costs, portrayed his economic policies as “an economic war of independence” during a late-night televised address to the nation. He made clear that his government would not step back from its policy of lowering borrowing rates to boost growth.Contrary to traditional economic theory, Erdogan argues that high interest rates cause inflation. Typically, central banks raise those rates to tame rising consumer prices.“Either we were going to give up on investments, production, growth and employment by keeping to the understanding that has prevailed in our country for years, or we were going to engage in a historic struggle in line with our priorities,” Erdogan said. “As always, we preferred the struggle.”“We are determined to do the right thing for our nation,” he continued. “We encourage investment, production and exports. ... We protect employment. ... We care about growth.”Turkey's Central Bank has cut interest rates by 4 percentage points since September, raising concerns about its independence from Erdogan’s government. The president has sacked three bank governors since 2019.Inflation is running at around 20%, eroding the public’s purchasing power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkish-lira-sees-historic-fall-as-erdogan-wages-economic-war-of-independence-101637677899634.html

The United States military flies, sails, and operates anywhere international law allows,” Lingo added.US warships periodically conduct exercises in the strait, almost always triggering angry responses from Beijing, which claims Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy, and surrounding waters as its own territory.The PLA’s eastern theatre command issued a statement saying it had deployed ships and aircraft to follow the US vessel.“This move by the US creates security risks and undermines regional stability. The theatre troops will take all necessary measures to resolutely counter all threats and provocations, and resolutely defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity,” spokesperson Colonel Shi Yi said.In Beijing, the Chinese foreign ministry echoed Yi’s views.“US warships have repeatedly flaunted their strength and made provocations in the Taiwan Strait under the guise of freedom of navigation. This is not a promise of freedom and openness, but a deliberate interference and destruction of regional peace and stability,” ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at the ministry briefing.“The US should immediately correct its mistakes, stop provoking troubles and playing with fire across the border, and play a constructive role for regional peace and stability,” he added.China has mounted repeated air force missions into Taiwan’s air defence identification zone (ADIZ) over the past year or so, provoking anger in Taipei.British, Canadian, French and Australian warships have all made passages through the Taiwan Strait in recent years, sparking protests from China.“Nine were conducted in 2019 followed by 15 in 2020. So far this year there have been 11, including the USS Milius crossing,” news agency AFP reported, quoting Collin Koh, a research fellow at Singapore’s S Rajaratnam School of International Studies, who keeps a database of declared US transits through the strait.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-expresses-anger-after-us-warship-transits-taiwan-strait-101637661533128.html

He is one of the FBI's most wanted men due to his involvement in suicide attacks and ties with Al Qaeda.Late last month, the Taliban urged the United States and other countries to recognise their government in Afghanistan, and said that the failure to do so and the continued freezing of Afghan funds abroad would “lead to problems not only for the country but for the world.”Zabihullah Mujahid recalled that the reason the Taliban and the US went to war last time was also because the two did not have formal diplomatic ties.ALSO READ | Taliban must seek legitimacy within Afghanistan before international recognitionNo country has formally recognised the interim Taliban government in Afghanistan since the Islamist insurgents took over the war-torn country in August, following the collpase of the Ashraf Ghani-led government, while billions of dollars in Afghan assets and funds abroad have also been frozen, even as the country faces severe economic and humanitarian crises.However, senior government officials from a number of countries have been meeting with the Taliban leadership both in Kabul and abroad to broker peace and aid deals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-leadership-afghanistan-government-ministers-and-officials-induction-101637658596062.html

And the two other charges each carried over 60 years behind bars."We are all so very happy that Kyle can live his life as a free and innocent man, but in this whole situation there are no winners, there are two people who lost their lives and that's not lost on us at all," David Hancock, a spokesperson for the Rittenhouse family, told Reuters.August 2020 shootingsKyle Rittenhouse went to Kenosha, about 32 kilometres from his home in Antioch, Illinois, on August 25 of last year as protesters in the city gathered after a White police officer shot Jacob Blake, a Black man, paralysing him from the waist down.Rittenhouse shot and killed Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, and fired a bullet that tore a chunk off the arm of Gaige Grosskreutz, 28. Rittenhouse claimed self-defence.Also read | Rittenhouse provoked bloodshed, walked off like a hero in a Western: ProsecutorRittenhouse's gun was loaded with 30 rounds of full metal jacket bullets, which are designed to penetrate their target. The violence was captured on mobile phones and surveillance video included the moments after Rittenhouse fired four rounds into Rosenbaum, who lay motionless, bleeding and groaning. Another video showed Grosskreutz screaming, with blood gushing from his arm.Rittenhouse said he shot Huber after he had struck him with a skateboard and pulled on his weapon. He said he fired on Grosskreutz after the man pointed the pistol he was carrying at him. Rittenhouse testified that he shot Rosenbaum after the man chased him and grabbed his gun.Rittenhouse said during the trial that he wanted to guard property against arson and destruction and tend to the injured. In his own defence last Wednesday in the trial's most dramatic moment, Rittenhouse emphasised that he acted out of fear for his life. "I did what I had to do to stop the person who was attacking me," he said.Defence vs prosecutionThe defence argued that Rittenhouse had been repeatedly attacked and shot the men in fear for his life. He was a civic-minded teenager who carried a medical kit in addition to his gun and was in Kenosha to protect private property after several nights of unrest in the city south of Milwaukee, they said.Also read | ‘He acted in self-defence’, says Kenosha protest gunman’s attorneyRittenhouse was portrayed by the prosecution as a reckless vigilante who provoked the violent encounters and showed no remorse for the men he shot with his AR-15-style rifle.ReactionsHuber's parents, Karen Bloom and John Huber, said they were "heartbroken" by the verdict. "It sends the unacceptable message that armed civilians can show up in any town, incite violence, and then use the danger they have created to justify shooting people in the street,” they said in a statement.The verdict was greeted with outrage by many on the political left and celebrated by gun-rights supporters.US President Joe Biden said on Friday he supported the jury's decision and urged Americans to react with calm. "While the verdict in Kenosha will leave many Americans feeling angry and concerned, myself included, we must acknowledge that the jury has spoken," Biden said.Also read | No charges against Wisconsin officer who shot Jacob BlakeLongtime civil rights leader Rev Jesse Jackson said the verdict throws into doubt the safety of people who protest in support of Black Americans. “It seems to me that it’s open season on human rights demonstrators,” he said."It is unconscionable our justice system would allow an armed vigilante ... to go free," the Congressional Black Caucus said in a statement.US congressman Madison Cawthorn, a Republican representative from North Carolina, posted his reaction on Instagram: "Kyle Rittenhouse is not guilty my friends. You have a right to defend yourselves. Be armed, be dangerous and be moral,” he said.The National Rifle Association tweeted the text of the Second Amendment of the US constitution, which protects the right to keep and bear arms, 15 minutes after the verdicts.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-teen-kyle-rittenhouse-acquitted-what-happened-in-kenosha-101637388805813.html
