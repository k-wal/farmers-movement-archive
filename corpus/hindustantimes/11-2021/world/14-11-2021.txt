The Lockheed Martin F-35 entered into service in 2015 with the U.S. Marine Corps.Yury Slusar, head of United Aircraft Corp, part of Russia's state aerospace and defence conglomerate, Rostec, said there had been "intensive contacts" with the Russian air force.Western diplomats doubt US-allied Gulf states would buy sophisticated equipment like the Checkmate, though sales of Russian hardware to the Gulf have increased in recent years.The UAE in 2017 signed a preliminary deal to buy Sukhoi Su-35 warplanes and jointly work with Russia on a next generation fighter but so far it appears not to have made progress."The UAE likes the idea of cultivating ties with the Russian defence industry but it's mainly a way to send a message to the U.S.," said Jean-Loup Samaan, senior research fellow with the Middle East Institute at the National University of Singapore.Washington's sale of 50 F-35 Lighting II warplanes to the UAE has slowed amid concerns about the UAE's relationship with China, including the prevalence of Huawei 5G technology in the country.The US agreed to sell the plane after the UAE last year established ties with Israel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-uae-waits-for-us-f-35s-russia-pitches-new-warplane-in-dubai-101636911142775.html

Biden took the office in January this year as the United States was struggling to contain the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and to revive the economy hit by the pandemic. He successfully pushed for a $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure package but that hasn't helped his overall approval rating.According to a Washington Post-ABC News poll conducted telephonically last week, 53% of the respondents disapproved of the way Biden has handled his job as the US president. While the majority of Americans support the federal government’s move to spend about two trillion dollars on addressing climate action and to create or expand preschool, health care and other social programs, 55% of the respondents don’t approve of Biden’s handling of the economy.Biden’s approval rating on his handling of the pandemic is also not encouraging. About 49% of respondents voted in disapproval and 47% approved the way the US president is handling the pandemic.Despite a low approval rating, the Democrat has performed better than his predecessor on the poll conducted after 10 months in office. While 63% of respondents believe Biden has achieved not much, little or nothing after being 10 months in office, 65% of respondents had a similar opinion about Trump after a similar period in 2017.A whopping 70% of the respondents either said the nation’s economy is “not so good” or is in “poor” condition.“Overall, the survey offers a set of harsh judgments about the president’s performance and the state of the economy. Together, they send a stark warning to Democrats about their prospects in the 2022 midterm contests,” The Post said in its report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/stark-warning-for-democrats-as-biden-s-approval-rating-hits-new-low-report-101636907127037.html

Ashraf Attia said.The storms forced scorpions from their hiding places into many houses across the province, Attia added. He said at least 503 people were hospitalized after suffering scorpion stings and that all of them were discharged after they were given anti-venom doses.Acting Health Minister Khalid Abdel-Ghafar said in a statement that no deaths were reported from scorpion stings.Photos and video footage circulated on social media showed flooded streets and damaged houses, vehicles and agricultural farms.The Al-Ahram daily reported the deaths, citing Ehab Hanafy, the Health Ministry’s Undersecretary in Aswan.

Austria has one of the continent's highest infection rates, with a seven-day incidence of 815 per 100,000 people."We are not taking this step lightly but it is necessary," Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg told a news conference announcing the new measure, under which the unvaccinated can only leave their homes for a limited number of reasons like going to work or shopping for essentials.Roughly 65% of Austria's population is fully vaccinated against Covid-19, one of the lowest rates in western Europe. Many Austrians are sceptical about vaccines, a view encouraged by the far-right Freedom Party, the third biggest in parliament.The measures on Monday will extend those brought in a week ago which banned the unvaccinated from places including restaurants, hotels, theatres and ski lifts.While the Netherlands is dealing with its surge in cases by imposing a partial lockdown that applies to all, Austria's conservative-led government wants to avoid imposing further restrictions on those who are fully vaccinated."In reality we have told one third of the population: you will not leave your apartment anymore apart from for certain reasons. That is a massive reduction in contacts between the vaccinated and the unvaccinated," Schallenberg said.In Germany, the federal government and leaders of Germany's 16 states are due to meet next week to discuss tightening measures. Germany has already classified Austria as a high-risk area, meaning people arriving from there have to go into quarantine, a blow to Austria's winter tourism industry.Targeted measures have recently been introduced in Australia, where 83% of people aged 16 and above have been fully inoculated. Some states have mandated vaccinations for some occupations and barred the unvaccinated from activities such as dining out, leading to demonstrations.Singapore, where 85% of the population has been fully vaccinated, has said those who remained unvaccinated by choice would have to foot their medical bills from next month.Austria's lockdown, which does not apply to the under-12s or people who have recently recovered from Covid-19, will initially last 10 days, Health Minister Wolfgang Mueckstein said.Many officials, including within Schallenberg's conservative party and the police, have expressed doubts this lockdown can be properly enforced as it applies to only part of the population. Interior Minister Karl Nehammer said there will be thorough police checks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/this-european-nation-is-imposing-lockdown-for-people-not-fully-vaccinated-against-covid-101636900337798.html

As of Monday non-essential shops, where no such passes are required, will be off-limits to the unvaccinated, but the only checks will be spot checks by the police, Nehammer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/austria-orders-millions-of-non-vaccinated-people-into-covid-19-lockdown-101636890667025.html

She is also believed to have given up drinking alcohol.At a public event in Brixton, south London, on Thursday, her eldest son and heir was asked by one onlooker: "Prince Charles, how is your mother?""She's alright," he replied.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uks-queen-elizabeth-ii-to-miss-remembrance-service-for-sprained-back-palace-101636887589938.html

US President Joe Biden has received sharp criticism from critics for his administration’s lack of preparedness for these refugees, who are spread across eight military bases in the country.A report by HuffPost said that the military base in Fort McCoy, Wisconsin houses the majority of the Afghan refugees with as many as 13,000 of them living there. The Pentagon has said 44 per cent of the nearly 50,00 refugees living at the bases are children as of October.Also Read | No more US boots on ground in AfghanistanThe HuffPost report further stated that some refugees have mentioned about not having sufficient winter robes even as temperatures have dipped.Volunteers and refugee settlement groups have also complained of being overwhelmed with the number of refugees, understaffed and the lack of plan by the Biden administration to help the Afghans transition into a life in the US.“There was never a plan because it was so chaotic from the beginning and there are so many unknowns,” Spojmie Ahmady Nasiri, a California-based immigration attorney, who has visited five of the eight military bases, told HuffPost.Also Read | ‘What’s your plan to ensure Taliban don’t acquire nuclear weapons from Pak?’: US lawmakers to BidenBiden has been under the knife due to the manner in which the pullout of US troops and evacuations of Afghans took place after the Taliban recaptured Afghanistan on August 15. The scenes at Kabul airport were nothing short of a mayhem with people standing in long queues starting early morning with documents in hand only to stand a chance to be flown out of the country and the grips of the Sunni Pashtun group.Despite pressure from US allies to extend the deadline for the pullout of the troops, Biden stuck to August 31 – only days after the Taliban talked of retaliation over an extension of the date.Khaama Press reported that critics have criticised the Biden administration for leaving behind tens of thousands of Afghans, who worked for the US in their 20-year-long war, and instead bringing unknown persons to the US.In October, Fox News had reported that an inspector general-ranked officer in the US state department will investigate the immigrant visa program and the clearing of Afghans for entry into the country as refugees. The report stated that the officer would also probe the evacuation of the US embassy in Kabul.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-refugees-at-us-military-base-struggle-from-scanty-winter-supplies-report-101636886249930.html

The military said it was unclear if the other 60 people were civilians, partly because women and children could have been combatants.In Saturday's statement, the military said the strikes were "legitimate self-defense," proportional and that "appropriate steps were taken to rule out the presence of civilians.""We abhor the loss of innocent life and take all possible measures to prevent them. In this case, we self-reported and investigated the strike according to our own evidence and take full responsibility for the unintended loss of life," Central Command said.The number of civilians among the 60 fatalities could not be determined because "multiple armed women and at least one armed child were observed" in video of the events, it said, adding that the majority of the 60 were likely combatants.Central Command said the strikes took place while Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) were under heavy fire and in danger of being overrun and the SDF had reported the area clear of civilians.The Defense Department's inspector general launched an inquiry into the March 18, 2019, incident, but its report was ultimately "stripped" of any mention of the bombing and a thorough, independent probe never took place, according to the Times. The newspaper said its report was based on confidential documents and descriptions of classified reports, as well as interviews with personnel directly involved.An Air Force lawyer present in the operations center at the time believed the strikes were possible war crimes and later alerted the Defense Department's inspector general and the Senate Armed Services Committee when no action was taken, the Times said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-military-hid-airstrikes-that-killed-dozens-of-civilians-in-syria-report-101636880570730.html

It has hindered efforts to boost state finances - hit hard last year by low oil prices and the pandemic - and enact a debt law needed to tap global markets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kuwait-emir-accepts-govt-resignation-in-a-bid-to-end-feud-with-lawmakers-report-101636885295740.html

Gen Anjum is presently Karachi Corps Commander and Gen Hameed has been posted as Peshawar Corps Commander.Even as the big two in Pakistan are at loggerheads, PM Khan’s political space appears to be shrinking due to poor economy due to high debt and inflation, and the Supreme Court Chief Justice Gulzar Ahmed hauling him over coals for seeking a peace deal with Tehreek-e-Taliban, Pakistan (TTP) terrorist group with the help of Sirajuddin Haqqani, head of the eponymous terrorist network. That the Pakistan regime virtually surrendered to the demands of marchers of Barelvi Tehreek-e-Labbaik (TLP) by lifting the ban on the extremist group and releasing its jailed leaders earlier this month has seriously added to PM Khan’s political discomfort.According to Islamabad watchers, Pakistan is currently on tenterhooks with all the major generals in the ISI already reporting to Lt Gen Nadeem Anjum, who is already in Rawalpindi to take over from Lt Gen Hameed. “There is political flux in Islamabad with rumours flying all over the place speculating outcomes of the fight between Khan and Bajwa in the run-up to the new DG ISI. There are even unverified reports that the 111 Rawalpindi brigade is also on the standby to tackle the worst-case scenario,” said an expert. There are reports that coalition partners of the Tehreek-e-Insaaf government like MQM and PML-Q are looking for other political options.One of the key reasons behind the removal of Lt Gen Hameed by Gen Bajwa was due to the former’s proximity to the Taliban regime in Kabul, particularly the Sirajuddin Haqqani group. While PM Khan wanted Afghanistan to add to Pakistan strategic space against India, Gen Bajwa apparently believes that the toxic ideology of the Taliban would ultimately harm his country. The Pakistan army chief is against radical extremism from Afghanistan spilling over across the Durand Line.While Pakistan polity is no stranger to constant political conspiracies and intrigue between the Army and the civilian leadership since 1947, the coming week may define whether PM Khan or Gen Bajwa comes on top.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-gen-bajwa-tension-simmers-in-pak-before-new-dg-isi-appointment-101636867622476.html

He also called upon member nations to phase out the usage of coal and protect vulnerable communities from the impacts of climate change.“The outcome of COP26 is a compromise. It reflects the interests, the contradictions and the state of political will in the world today. It is an important step, but it is not enough. We must accelerate climate action, to keep alive the goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees,” Guterres said after nations signed a deal in this regard.The #COP26 outcome is a compromise, reflecting the interests, contradictions & state of political will in the world today.

It is time to go into emergency mode. We must end fossil fuel subsidies. Phase out coal. Put a price on carbon. Protect vulnerable communities from the impacts of climate change. And make good on the 100 billion USD climate finance commitment to support developing countries,” he added.Also read | What's in the Glasgow Climate Pact?He also welcomed the commitments made by member nations at the conference to end deforestation, reduce methane emissions and mobilising private finance around net zero emissions and called them “building blocks for progress”. He said the Glasgow agreement reaffirms commitment towards keeping global temperature rise within 1.5 degrees Celsius.Guterres said that while science stressed “rapid, deep and sustained” reduction in emissions as the goal in this decade, particularly a 45% cut in emissions by 2030 from the 2010 levels, the full implementation of the climate goals determined by the nations would still result in an increase in emissions.He said it would lead to global temperature rise going “well above” 2 degree Celsius by the end of the century.In his message to young people and those leading efforts on climate action, he assured of his support to such work. “I want to send a message to young people, indigenous communities, women leaders, all those leading on climate action. I know you are disappointed,” he said. “We are in the fight of our lives and this fight must be won. Never give up. Never retreat. Keep pushing forward.

We continue to encourage the public to be cautious of unknown senders and urge you to report suspicious activity," it added.There was no indication of how the emails were sent -- whether by someone using legitimate access to the server or a hacker from outside.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fake-emails-warning-urgent-threat-actor-in-systems-sent-from-secure-fbi-server-101636855686050.html

It makes no sense to give boosters to healthy adults, or to vaccinate children, when health workers, older people, and other high-risk groups around the world are still awaiting their first dose,” he remarked, though he also said that as an exception, only immunocompromised people should be administered booster doses, as previously suggested by the global health body in October.Also Read | WHO experts suggest booster Covid-19 vaccine shot for immunocompromisedGhebreyesus further alleged that some countries were ‘stockpiling’ vaccines. “Nations with the highest vaccine coverage continue to stockpile more vaccines, while low-income countries continue to wait,” he said.Also Read | In France, people above 65 yrs will need booster jab for Covid-19 passAll of this is a ‘scandal’ that must be stopped now, he added.The WHO director-general's remarks come at a time when several countries are already administering booster doses to at least a section of their respective eligible population due to a fresh surge in Covid-19 cases, or due to an expected surge. Several others have either authorised or are contemplating booster doses. For example, in Europe, which has once again become the ‘epicentre’ of the pandemic, additional doses will be given in countries such as Norway and Italy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/globally-6-times-more-covid-19-boosters-administered-every-day-who-chief-wants-scandal-to-end-101636847939121.html

Here's a brief summary: Blah, blah, blah. But the real work continues outside these halls. And we will never give up, ever.”The #COP26 is over. Here’s a brief summary: Blah, blah, blah.But the real work continues outside these halls. And we will never give up, ever. https://t.co/EOne9OogiRThe youth campaigner also retweeted an earlier post of hers, where she had indicated that such ‘compromises’ in the way of climate action are equivalent to losing. “Unless we achieve immediate, drastic, unprecedented, annual emission cuts at the source then that means we're failing when it comes to this climate crisis,” she had written, adding “small steps in the right direction, “making some progress” or “winning slowly” equals losing”.The climate talks in Scotland are, however, being lauded for keeping alive hopes of capping global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius and maintaining a realistic shot at saving the world from catastrophic climate change.Although the two-week conference in Glasgow was the 26th of its kind, it was the first to call for a reduction in fossil fuels that not only power much of the world's economy but are also the main causes of manmade global warming.WATCH | Greta Thunberg's verdict after COP26 Glasgow summit to address climate changeHowever, there was some last-minute drama as India, backed by China and a few other coal-dependent developing nations, raised objections to this part of the agreement and asked for the wording to be rewritten. The clause was hurriedly amended to ask countries to accelerate their efforts towards a coal power “phase down” instead of “phase out”.This, Union environment and climate minister Bhupender Yadav later told Reuters, was done to reflect the “national circumstances of emerging economies”. He also expressed his apprehension over the fact that coal had been “singled out” during the COP26 talks, while there was no similar call to phase out oil or natural gas, even though rich, developed nations have historically emitted the largest share of greenhouse gases.Thunberg and other activists had earlier denounced the conference for the way it was playing out, arguing that world leaders had failed to match their words with real action. Thunberg said that pledges from some nations made during COP26 to accelerate their emissions cuts amounted to little more than “a two-week-long celebration of business as usual” and “blah, blah, blah”. (With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/blah-blah-blah-greta-thunberg-s-assessment-of-cop26-climate-agreement-101636846931176.html
14-11-2021||World||Tense final hours at COP26 amid tough stands on deal||Consensus eluded the 196 parties at the Glasgow climate change conference (COP26) on Saturday after developed and developing nations remained deeply divided over the third Cover Decision Text released by the COP26 presidency, with India being one of those that maintained a tough stand on the issue.While the deliberations appeared to be tentatively heading for a deal that conference host Britain said would keep alive a goal of capping global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius to maintain a realistic chance of avoiding catastrophe, tensions spilled into the open as the talks came down to the wire.China and India, the world’s first- and third-biggest emitters, put up a tough stance to the most ambitious parts of the final agreement in Glasgow. India objected to the point of asking countries to shift away from fossil fuels. The two nations flagged that the draft text lacked balance, differentiation, and equity.The red lines were on the issues of compensating loss and damage, mobilising climate mitigation and adaptation finance by developed countries for developing nations. Late on Saturday, many nations said that in the spirit of compromise, they may endorse the third draft text even if they did not agree with most aspects of the draft.COP26 was to close on Friday evening but negotiations stretched overnight, with deep divergences that couldn’t be resolved even as COP26 president Alok Sharma insisted “parties have different priorities, but we have to sign up to the same view. We have reached a comprehensive, balanced outcome. The text is now clear of brackets and is a result of a transparent, party driven process”.Following the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report in August flagging that 1.5 degrees Celsius global warming threshold is likely to be breached in the next 10 to 20 years, COP26 was being seen as the last chance to keep the 1.5 degrees C goal in reach through an ambitious and equitable agreement in Glasgow. But on Saturday, even after two weeks of negotiations and very ambitious pledges by world leaders during the Leaders’ Summit on November 1 and 2, very serious concerns and differences remained.Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav, head of the Indian delegation, made an intervention on inequitable aspects of the draft text. “Consensus has remained elusive. Climate friendly lifestyles and climate justice is enshrined in the Paris Agreement are key to solving the climate crisis. The crisis is caused by unsustainable lifestyles and wasteful consumption patterns. The world needs to awaken to this reality,” he said, adding that “fossil fuels and their use has enabled parts of the world to attain high levels of wealth and wellbeing… when we have taken economy wide targets, targeting any particular sector is uncalled for”.“Every country will arrive at net zero as per its own national circumstances. Developing countries have a right to the fair share of the global carbon budget and are entitled to responsible use of fossil fuels in such scope. In such a situation how can one expect developing countries to make promises of phasing out coal and fossil fuel subsidies?” Yadav said that towards poverty eradication, subsidies to certain fossil fuels provide much-needed social security and support. China also said the text was by no means perfect but it said it was willing to engage with other parties on concerns with the text. China insisted the expressions in the G20 statement on climate can be reflected in the Glasgow cover text.US special envoy on climate John Kerry said the China-US deal in Glasgow showed that despite conflict, countries can come together on the climate crisis, reach above conflict and differences to find common ground.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/climate-meet-in-glasgow-tense-final-hours-at-cop26-amid-tough-stands-on-deal-101636828370575.html
