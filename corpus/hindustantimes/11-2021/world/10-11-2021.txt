Instead, last week he delivered a written statement to the opening section of the summit when leaders usually give speeches.In it, he offered no additional pledges, while urging countries to keep their promises and "strengthen mutual trust and cooperation".Xi pledged at the U.N. General Assembly in September that China will achieve carbon neutrality before 2060.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-and-us-to-make-joint-statement-at-cop26-climate-summit-101636566679065.html

We have shown it's possible, it can work, it goes a huge long way to save at least the people's economy in the country," said Wignaraja.In the meantime, UN International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) has announced to be directly funding Afghan teachers across the country.The total amount of money provided by the Global Fund amounts to USD 15 million, from the money USD 8 million were paid for the health workers and the remaining money was allocated for supplying medical equipment and essential drugs, reported Khaama Press.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-collapsing-system-un-pays-8-million-in-salaries-to-afghan-health-workers-101636565671620.html
10-11-2021||World||UK researchers identify T-cell targets for future Covid-19 vaccines||British researchers said on Wednesday they had identified proteins in the coronavirus that are recognised by T-cells of people who are exposed to the virus but resist infection, possibly providing a new target for vaccine developers.Immunity against Covid-19 is a complex picture, and while there is evidence of waning antibody levels six months after vaccination, T-cells are also believed to play a vital role in providing protection.The University College London (UCL) researchers examined 731 health workers in two London hospitals during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, and found that many had not tested positive despite likely exposure to the original coronavirus.They found that, while a subset of the workers did not generate antibodies or test positive with PCR tests, they had still generated a large and broad T-cell response following possible exposure.This suggests that rather than the workers avoiding exposure to the coronavirus altogether, the T-cells had cleared the virus before there were any symptoms or positive test result - a so-called "abortive infection", the researchers said."We know that some individuals remain uninfected despite having likely exposure to the virus," said Leo Swadling, lead author of the study, which was published in science journal Nature."What is really informative is that the T-cells detected in these individuals, where the virus failed to establish a successful infection, preferentially target different regions of the virus to those seen after infection."Current vaccines, which provide high protection against severe disease but do not fully stop transmission or re-infection, target the spike protein of the coronavirus.In contrast, the T-cell responses that led to abortive infections in the UCL study recognised and targeted instead "replication proteins".The researchers said that while such T-cells were associated with protection from detectable infection, they were not necessarily sufficient for protection alone, and the study did not look at whether people had protection on re-exposure.They added that the replication proteins are among the least changed by mutations to coronaviruses, and exposure to other coronaviruses may be one reason why some of the health workers were able to mount such quick T cell responses.It also means that a vaccine which targeted these proteins in addition to the spike protein should work against a broad range of coronaviruses including the currently dominant Delta variant, the researchers said."This is a strong rationale for including these proteins to supplement spike in next-generation vaccines," Swadling told reporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-researchers-identify-t-cell-targets-for-future-covid-19-vaccines-101636562150468.html

Soon, it said, users will be able to livestream video from Teams into Workplace groups.Remote-working tools have become key fixtures for companies during the Covid-19 pandemic."You have to meet employees where they directly are, wherever they're doing their work, whatever platforms they're most using," said Ujjwal Singh, head of Workplace, in an interview. He said the integration was largely aimed at customers of both products.Workplace, which the Silicon Valley company uses as its internal messaging board, was launched outside of the company five years ago. Former Facebook employee and whistleblower Frances Haugen recently leaked internal presentations and discussions shared on the service.The software is also used by companies including Walmart and Deliveroo. Facebook says it has 7 million paid subscribers on Workplace.Microsoft and Facebook, which recently changed its name to Meta to signal its refocus on the metaverse, are also both building out virtual reality solutions for remote working.Microsoft last week announced it would bring its virtual platform Mesh into Microsoft Teams next year. Facebook recently launched a beta test of Horizon Workrooms, a remote work app for users of its VR headsets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebooks-work-app-workplace-to-integrate-with-microsoft-teams-101636560072441.html
10-11-2021||World||US becomes 101st member country of International Solar Alliance||The US on Wednesday became the 101st member of the International Solar Alliance (ISA), an inter-governmental organisation formed by India and France to accelerate the global adoption of solar power. The US special envoy for climate, John Kerry, announced at the COP26 in Glasgow that the US has joined the ISA as a member country after signing the framework agreement. “It has long been coming and we are happy to join the International Solar Alliance, which Prime Minister Narendra Modi took the lead in making. We worked out the details and this is a process we are pleased to be a part of. This will be an important contribution to more rapid deployment of solar globally,” Kerry said. Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav welcomed the US as the 101st member of ISA. “This move will strengthen the ISA and propel future action on providing a clean source of energy to the world,” he said. The ISA’s framework, which was first circulated in 2016 to obtain backing from other countries, emphasises on delivering local benefits to all countries through collaborations. The ISA’s key interventions focus on enabling activities, risk mitigation and innovative financing instruments to facilitate the deployment of solar technologies. ISA is building a solar project pipeline of nearly 5 GW installed capacity in order to achieve a vision of interconnected global grids, which was jointly launched as the “Green Grids Initiative – One Sun One World One Grid” during the world leaders’ summit of COP26 in Glasgow on November 2 by the UK and India. Earlier at COP26, the US joined the steering committee of the “One Sun One World One Grid” initiative that includes Australia, France, the UK and India. ISA director general Ajay Mathur described the US endorsement of ISA’s framework as a heartening development which demonstrates that nations around the world are recognising the economic and climate mitigating value of solar energy. “We hope remaining nations and economies will follow suit, and align with us to achieve swift, affordable and effective climate action, while also achieving their respective economic growth and long-term development priorities,” Mathur said. The launch of ISA was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and then French president Francois Hollande on November 30, 2015, at COP21 in Paris. ISA has a global mandate to catalyse solar growth by helping reduce the cost of financing and technology. It helps large nations scale global commitments while assisting economically vulnerable nations to establish a self-sustaining energy alternative that reduces trade dependency and drives job creation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-becomes-101st-member-country-of-international-solar-alliance-101636559961458.html
10-11-2021||World||'Mr Prime Minister, we are not a small country': Pakistan Supreme Court grills Imran Khan on talks with TTP||Pakistan Supreme Court on Wednesday grilled Prime Minister Imran Khan during the hearing on the 2014 terror attack on a school which was carried out by Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) from whom Imran Khan has recently removed the ban. "You are in power. The government is also yours. What did you do? You brought those guilty to the negotiating table," Chief Justice of Pakistan Gulzar Ahmed said.In the 2014 massacre, 147 people, 132 of them children, were martyred when TTP militants stormed the APS-Warsak School, in Peshawar. Imran Khan was summoned by the apex court for Wednesday's hearing. "Are we going to surrender once again?" Justice Qazi Mohammad Amin Ahmed asked the PM as the premier appeared before the bench. Imran Khan told the bench that the 2014 attack was very painful and his party was in power in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa when the attack took place. "Find out why 80,000 people were killed. Also, find out who is responsible for 480 drone attacks taking place in Pakistan," Imran Khan said.In reply, the chief justice said, "Finding out about these things is your job, you are the prime minister. As the prime minister, you should have the answer to these questions…You are the prime minister, you should have answers.""Mr Prime Minister, we are not a small country. We have the sixth largest army in the world," said Justice Amin.The attorney general, on behalf of the government, accepted the mistakes. “FIR could not be registered against higher-ups,” the attorney general said. "Where do the intelligence [agencies] disappear when it comes to the protection of their own citizens? "Was a case registered against the former army chief and others responsible?" the chief justice asked. The attorney general replied that the inquiry report did not find anything related to the former army chief and former director-general of the Inter-Services Intelligence.“There is such a huge intelligence system in the country. Billions of rupees are spent on it. There is also a claim that we are the best intelligence agency in the world. So much is being spent on intelligence but the results are zero,” the chief justice said. "We could have simply said the PML-N was in power at that time and accused then-PM Nawaz Sharif and the former interior minister of failure. But we realise this war is beyond individuals," information minister Fawad Chaudhry said later outside the court. The government is in talks with the TTP over a "reconciliation process" and Chaudhry announced on Monday that a "complete ceasefire" had been reached with the banned outfit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mr-prime-minister-we-are-not-a-small-country-pakistan-supreme-court-grills-imran-khan-on-talks-with-ttp-101636542705376.html

We support all efforts conducive for stability in Afghanistan to building up consensus in the world,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin said at the regular ministry briefing on Wednesday.“China’s special envoy to Afghanistan will attend the meeting,” Wang said without giving more details.China’s special envoy for Afghan Affairs Yue Xiaoyong will lead a delegation to the meeting, Chinese state media reported.China and Pakistan have been working closely in dealing with the new Taliban government in Kabul, which came to power in August, following a chaotic withdrawal of US troops from the war-torn country.China’s snub to India on Wednesday’s security dialogue in New Delhi comes at a time when Sino-India bilateral ties are fraught over the ongoing military standoff in eastern Ladakh.“Due to scheduling reasons, it is inconvenient for China to attend the meeting,” foreign ministry spokesperson Wang had said on Tuesday.Reports from Islamabad said Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi and national security advisor Moeed Yusuf will chair the ‘Troika Plus’ meeting on Thursday.The representative of the four countries will also meet Afghanistan’s acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, Dawn newspaper reported.Muttaqi is set to arrive in Islamabad on Wednesday.It is the first visit to Pakistan by an Afghan minister since the Taliban seized control of Kabul in August, the Dawn report said.In September, China’s special envoy Yue along with envoys from Russia and Pakistan, visited Kabul to hold talks with senior officials from the Afghan interim government.Russian, Chinese and Pakistani special envoys to Afghanistan held another meeting in Moscow in October.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-join-pakistan-s-troika-plus-meeting-on-afghanistan-101636540100426.html
10-11-2021||World||Tackling climate change: New draft deal released at COP26||The draft of an agreement - also called “cover decision” - that chalks out all important elements of the climate negotiations including how countries will cut emissions to avoid temperature rises of above 1.5°C was published early on Wednesday on the sidelines of the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow, Scotland.Two drafts were released. One was released by the CMA, which is basically the group of nations that signed and ratified the Paris Agreement. The group is also called “Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement”. The other draft was released by the COP, which is the Conference of the Parties. It is the CMA’s draft that mainly deals with the important decisions.The text of the newly released draft on combating climate change had several changes over the previous version, making it appear weaker on certain fronts.The draft, proposed by COP26 president Alok Sharma, underlines the Paris Agreement temperature goal of capping the rise in the average global temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and it also calls for pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.However, the text says the impact of climate change will be much lesser at the temperature increase of 1.5°C as compared to 2°C.Also Read: New climate pledges not enough: StudiesThe draft recognises that keeping global warming to under 1.5°C requires meaningful and effective action by all parties, reflecting common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities in the light of different national circumstances.“The text doesn’t crisply, clearly articulate the 1.5-degree goal. It’s still a bit fuzzy,” said David Waskow, international climate director at the World Resources Institute (WRI).Meeting the 1.5°C goal would require reducing global CO2 emissions by 45% by 2030 relative to the 2010 level and to reach net zero by around mid-century. But the aggregate greenhouse gas emission level, taking into account implementation of all nationally determined contributions (NDCs) submitted, is estimated to be 13.7% above the 2010 level in 2030, the draft says.Waskow said a positive development in the draft was that the parties have been urged to come forward by 2022 with revisited, improved NDCs. It also has language on phasing out of coal and fossil fuel subsidies, which have been named specifically in the text.On climate finance, the draft urges developed countries to provide financial resources to developing nations with respect to both mitigation and adaptation, in continuation of their existing obligations under the convention. It also encourages all parties to provide such support voluntarily.The draft only recognises that discussions on a new post 2025 quantified finance goal has started. It has no other details.On loss and damage, the draft urges developed nations operating entities of the financial mechanism, the UN, intergovernmental organisations, and bilateral and multilateral institutions including NGOs and private parties, to provide enhanced support for activities addressing the impact of climate change.On adaptation finance, the draft calls upon the private sector, multilateral development banks and other financial institutions to enhance finance mobilisation in order to be able to deliver the scale of resources needed. There are a lot of gaps, bracketed areas which still need to be addressed.“There is a placeholder on how we will move towards a global goal for adaptation. There is no date by which adaptation finance will be doubled and baseline is not mentioned. This is weak. But there may be a trade-off between this and other elements. We have to see how developing countries respond,” said Yamide Dagnet, director of climate negotiations at the WRI.HT has reported that developing countries have expressed frustration over the lack of credibility and failure to deliver promised climate finance of $100 billion.Developed and developing countries are divided on a new quantified finance goal for the post-2025 period.India will not update its NDC to reflect the pledges made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the Climate Leader’s Summit at Glasgow on November 1 and 2, which was part of the ongoing COP26 talks, until there is clarity on climate finance, a top member of the Indian delegation said on condition of anonymity.Waskow said these texts are significant international agreements. They have consequence and an important part of international law being under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. “The parties take them seriously, so they negotiate very hard on these,” he said.“What’s in #COP26 cover decision draft? Call for stronger NDCs next year. Call for coal phase-out, FF subsidy phase-out. Annual ambition push, progress report. Call for loss and damage finance. Loose words on finance,” tweeted Simon Evans, policy editor at Carbon Brief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tackling-climate-change-new-draft-deal-released-at-cop26-101636535359765.html
10-11-2021||World||Federal judge refuses Trump's request to block January 6 records||A federal judge on Tuesday rejected former US president Donald Trump's request to block the release of documents to the House committee investigating the January 6 Capitol riot.In denying a preliminary injunction, US district judge Tanya Chutkan said Congress had a strong public interest in obtaining records that could shed light on a violent insurrection mounted by the former president's supporters. She added that president Joe Biden had the authority to waive executive privilege over the documents despite Trump's assertions otherwise.Barring a court order, the National Archives plans to turn over Trump's records to the committee by Friday. But Trump's lawyers swiftly promised an appeal to the US Court of Appeals for the district of Columbia Circuit. The case will likely eventually head to the US Supreme Court.“At the bottom, this is a dispute between a former and incumbent president,” Chutkan wrote. “And the Supreme Court has already made clear that in such circumstances, the incumbent's view is accorded greater weight.”Trump “does not acknowledge the deference owed” to Biden's judgment as to the current president, Chutkan said. She noted examples of past presidents declining to assert executive privilege and rejected what she said was Trump's claim that executive privilege “exists in perpetuity.”“Presidents are not kings, and Plaintiff is not President,” she said.According to an earlier court filing from the archives, the records include call logs, drafts of remarks and speeches, and handwritten notes from Trump's then-chief of staff, Mark Meadows. There are also copies of talking points from then-press secretary Kayleigh McEnany and “a draft Executive Order on the topic of election integrity,” the National Archives has said.Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., who chairs the House committee, said in a statement after the ruling that the records are crucial for understanding the attack and “in my view, there couldn't be a more compelling public interest than getting answers about an attack on our democracy.”On CNN, Thompson said Trump should stop behaving like a “spoiled brat.”The nine-member House committee is investigating not just Trump's conduct on January 6 — when he told a rally to “fight like hell” shortly before rioters overran law enforcement — but his efforts in the months before the riot to challenge election results or obstruct a peaceful transfer of power.The committee has interviewed more than 150 witnesses and issued more than 30 subpoenas, including ones announced Tuesday to McEnany and former top adviser Stephen Miller. It is unclear, so far, whether the lawmakers will eventually call Trump to testify.Trump has repeatedly attacked the committee's work and continued to promote unfounded conspiracy theories about widespread fraud in the election, despite the fact that Biden's win was certified by all 50 states and his claims have been rebuked by courts across the country.In suing to block the National Archives from turning over documents, Trump called the House panel's request a “vexatious, illegal fishing expedition” that was “untethered from any legitimate legislative purpose." Allowing the House to get access to his records would also damage executive privilege for future presidents, Trump's lawyers argued.But Chutkan said the "the public interest lies in permitting — not enjoining — the combined will of the legislative and executive branches to study the events that led to and occurred on January 6, and to consider legislation to prevent such events from ever occurring again.”Trump spokesperson Taylor Budowich tweeted late Tuesday that the case “was destined to be decided by the Appellate Courts.” He added that “Trump remains committed to defending the Constitution & the Office of the Presidency, & will be seeing this process through.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/federal-judge-refuses-trump-s-request-to-block-january-6-records-101636532118861.html
10-11-2021||World||Canada authorises Pfizer Covid vaccine booster for adults||Canada on Tuesday authorised the use of the booster dose of the Covid vaccine co-developed by Pfizer and BioNTech for those aged 18 years and above.The decision from the Canadian health authorities makes Pfizer/BioNTech’s application for its booster the first to get clearance in Canada.The booster, according to Health Canada, can be administered to those who completed the full “primary series” of two doses at least six months earlier.“Booster doses are designed to help people maintain their immunity longer. Health Canada authorized the booster dose after a thorough, independent review of the evidence,” Health Canada said in a tweet.Last month, the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommended that those at risk, including seniors above 70, could be given a booster of a Covid vaccine, while also stating it could be given to those who had two doses of the Astra Zeneca jab.The announcement from Health Canada came as the country recorded a slight increase in Covid infections. Chief public health officer Dr Theresa Tam tweeted there was a “little bump” in cases with nationally, the seven-day moving average of daily cases was up 4% compared to last week.“Though not unexpected as more activities move indoors, it’s a reminder we need those layers of protection.” Tam said.Canada reported 2,380 Covid cases on Tuesday, taking the total to 1737,389. An additional Covid 24 deaths were also reported, taking the overall death toll from the pandemic to 29,217.Over 84% of those eligible for Covid vaccination (aged 12 and over) have been fully jabbed, making for 74% of the total population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-authorises-pfizer-covid-vaccine-booster-for-adults-101636526959254.html
10-11-2021||World||Top Chinese virologist hits out at govt's Covid Zero push||A top Chinese virologist warned the country risks economic collapse if local officials continue to try to wipe out all traces of Covid-19, marking the most vocal criticism of China’s so-called Covid Zero approach by one of its own experts.Guan Yi, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong, disparaged China’s effort to eliminate sporadic flareups of the virus through mass testing and lengthy quarantines. In the wide-ranging interview with Hong Kong-based Phoenix Satellite TV, he urged a reality-check on how well an extensive vaccination drive helped the world’s most populous country build immunity to Covid. “We don’t stand a chance if we pursue a target of zero Covid,” said Guan, who’s been dubbed the “virus hunter” by the Chinese media for his work on identifying the animal origins of the coronaviruses that caused SARS and MERS. “The virus is here today, just like flu. That’s a fact, whether people like it or not.”The ability to break away from Covid Zero hinges on the effectiveness of the vaccines and the cost of controlling the virus, Guan said. It’s crucial for China to figure out how much protection its mass vaccination program has afforded the population, he said.“Let’s not roll out nucleic acid testing for everyone at every turn,” he said. “I think it’s testing antibodies that matters. Everybody should know where their immunity is at.”Guan’s comments are a rare, high-profile criticism from within the country’s elite of its lingering adherence to Covid Zero, which other adherents like Singapore and Australia have abandoned as the more transmissible delta variant makes it almost impossible to maintain. The criticism follows on the heels of an emotional plea for support made by the former vice mayor of a border town called Ruili in southwestern China, where repetitive lockdowns after Covid incursions from Myanmar are threatening livelihoods and exhausting local officials.Isolated China is cracking under the strain of keeping Covid outOfficials in China have said they still consider squashing domestic flareups with aggressive curbs a better option for people’s safety and the economy’s health than reopening borders and easing restrictions. The country will maintain stringent curbs at least through spring given the outbreaks beyond its borders, health officials said in Beijing on Saturday. It’s also doubling-down on vaccinations. More than 75% of the country is fully protected and authorities are rolling out booster shots to all adults. Immunizations are now available to children as young as three years old. This is how long experts think China will stick with Covid ZeroStill, Guan questioned the impact of vaccination in China when local governments won’t relent on controls such as quarantine and temperature screening. While taking temperatures is ubiquitous across the country, the virologist said that’s a “lagging defense” because infected people can spread the virus without showing any symptoms. “Don’t blame the virus for being stealthy,” he said. “We just consider ourselves smarter than we really are.” Instead, Guan said the country must develop a clearer understanding about how the homegrown vaccines are working against new variants of the virus. It should “kick out vaccines that have become ineffective,” he said. China’s leading shots, from state-backed Sinopharm and Sinovac Biotech Ltd., use traditional vaccine technology. While clinical trials show them to be effective at preventing severe cases of Covid, hospitalizations and deaths, they are less reliable than Western mRNA shots at stopping transmission and reducing overall case counts. “One can tell what’s good or bad through comparison,” Guan said. “If we fail to recognize our shortcomings, we lack the incentive to make progress.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-chinese-virologist-hits-out-at-govt-s-covid-zero-push-101636523115155.html
10-11-2021||World||Dalai Lama was asked if he wants to visit Taiwan. Here's his answer||The Dalai Lama said on Wednesday that he prefers to stay in India since relations between Taiwan and mainland China are “quite delicate”. The Tibetan spiritual leader, who has time and again expressed his gratitude to the Indian government for providing him and followers refuge in the country, was asked during an online news conference about visiting Taiwan, to which he replied by saying that he prefers to stay in India.According to the Reuters news agency, the Dalai Lama also said that he has no particular plans to meet China's president Xi Jinping.Notably, China claims the democratic island of Taiwan as its own territory and says it should be taken by force if necessary. Taiwan resists, saying it is an independent country and will defend its freedoms and democracy in the face of China's aggression. Beijing seems to have aggravated its hostile policies in recent days, with a record number of Chinese military aircraft repeatedly flying over Taiwan's air defence identification zone. Taiwan's radars spotted as many as 150 Chinese air force aircraft entering its air defence zone early last month, part of a pattern of what Taipei calls Beijing's continued harassment of the island.The Dalai Lama, a supremely important figure in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, has been living a life of a refugee in India ever since he had to flee Tibet in the wake of a revolt in 1959. He advocates for the welfare of Tibetans while continuing to call for diplomatic approaches to negotiations with China for the autonomy of Tibet and the protection of Tibetan culture, including the religious rights of Tibetans. (With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dalai-lama-was-asked-if-he-wants-to-visit-taiwan-here-s-his-answer-101636521624751.html

There were protests in France when the measures were first introduced over the summer but they have since diminished."We have not finished with the pandemic," Macron said, explaining that while France is currently in a better position than either Germany or the UK, infection rates have gone up 40 percent over the past week.Macron noted that "all the studies show" that six months after getting the vaccine, "immunity decreases and therefore the risk of developing a serious form (of Covid) increases"."The solution to this decrease in immunity is an additional vaccine shot," he said.'Responsible and united'Macron also urged the six million people eligible for the vaccine in France who have not yet even received a first dose to come forward and get the jab."This is an appeal to responsibility -- get vaccinated," he said.Macron said more than 80 percent of the people in intensive care in France with Covid were aged over 50 and announced the government would launch a campaign in December for 50-64-year-olds to have booster shots.He said that the booster campaign for the over 65s now had to be "accelerated".The president appears eager to make a successful fight against coronavirus one of his key boasts in April presidential elections, where he is expected to stand for a second term even though he has yet to declare his candidacy.Many analysts had warned he would face stiff opposition to the Covid pass plan in the summer but the strategy helped force a significant surge in vaccine take-up."To be free in a nation like France means being responsible and united. So I'm counting on you," Macron said.The French leader added that the "vaccine alone is not enough" and mask-wearing rules needed to stay in place."Any relaxations that have been considered will be put off in order to keep the rules currently in force," he said.Health pass checks will also be stepped up, he added.Macron said France was "one of the most protected countries in the world" due to its vaccine rollout but warned that "we will have to live with this virus until the whole global population is immunised."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-france-people-above-65-yrs-will-need-booster-jab-for-covid-19-pass-101636518355352.html

It is the first visit to Pakistan by an Afghan minister since the Taliban seized control of Kabul in August."Troika Plus at SRs (special representatives level) will meet with Muttaqi," the Pakistani official said.The dialogue is taking place at a time when the Taliban is seeking international recognition. However, the international community is not in hurry to give legitimacy to the Taliban interim government unless they fulfil their promises."Troika Plus has become an important forum for engagement with Afghan authorities. It will express support for an inclusive government, discuss ways to prevent a humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan as well as the protection of human rights, particularly women's rights," he said.This is the first full-fledged meeting of the Troika Plus after the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan.The last of this format was held in August in Doha, in which the US was represented by the former special envoy for Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad.Another meeting was convened by Russia in Moscow on October 19, but the US did not participate citing "logistics".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-to-host-troika-summit-to-discuss-afghanistan-situation-101636515058611.html

I'm sure some of them will prove to be very safe and efficacious and others may not."There could be advantages to some of the second-generation vaccines... clearly if you have an oral vaccine or an intra-nasal vaccine this is easier to deliver than an injectable."Ultimately we'll be able to choose the ones that are most appropriate."If not for Covid, we're going to use these platforms for other infections in the future."Swaminathan explained the advantages of a vaccine being sprayed into the nose, as happens in some countries with influenza vaccines."If there's a local immune response then it will take care of the virus before it even goes and establishes itself in the lungs and starts causing a problem," she said.The WHO has only given emergency use authorisation to seven Covid-19 vaccines: those created by Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Sinopharm, Sinovac, and last week Bharat Biotech."None of the vaccines are 100 percent. Nobody has ever claimed that the vaccines are going to be 100 percent protective. But 90 percent is a wonderful amount of protection to have, compared to zero," Swaminathan said."Till now, with the vaccines that we have approved, there has not been any signal which has been so worrying that we need to say, well, we need to re-think this vaccine."More than 7.25 billion vaccine doses have been administered around the world, according to an AFP count.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-who-looking-forward-to-2nd-gen-vaccines-in-form-of-nasal-oral-shots-101636514620064.html

The data was the result of a four-week, in-state study. The risk of death was 48 times higher for unvaccinated people in their 30s and 63 times higher for those in their 40s, the study found.Life expectancy affectedThe pandemic’s effects on mortality have been uneven. Life expectancy dipped in most places last year, shaving 28.1 million years off the cumulative longevity in 31 countries. But residents of a handful of places that successfully kept Covid-19 at bay actually lived longer.A study of 37 countries and territories in the journal BMJ found the pandemic was a killing field in most places. More than 28 million years of life were lost in 2020 across 31 of them, with Russia, Bulgaria, Lithuania, the US, and Poland recording the heaviest toll.Years of life lost in 2020 were higher than expected everywhere except Taiwan, New Zealand, Norway, Iceland, Denmark, and South Korea.Singapore is rolling back some curbs, with five people from the same residence allowed to dine at restaurants starting from Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fully-vaccinated-16-times-less-likely-to-die-study-101636511950339.html

The company’s spacecraft are dropped from the carrier at about 50,000 feet before igniting a rocket motor and continuing to space.The startup’s new VSS Imagine spaceship is to begin flight tests in early 2023 and will be flying twice monthly later that year, joining the current VSS Unity ship, which will fly about once per month, Colglazier said.The company has sold around 100 tickets since flying its founder Richard Branson to space last summer, the company said in its financial results on Monday. The current price of the fare is $450,000 per seat, well above the $200,000-$250,000 paid by some 600 customers from 2005 to 2014. In total, the company has now sold 700 tickets, a spokesperson told AFP.SpaceX brings four astronauts back to EarthFour astronauts returned to Earth Monday in a SpaceX craft after spending six months on the International Space Station.The international crew conducted thousands of experiments in orbit and helped upgrade the solar panels on the ISS during their “Crew-2” mission.Its descent slowed by four huge parachutes, their Dragon spacecraft - dubbed “Endeavour” - splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico at 10:30pm before it was lifted onto a recovery ship.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/from-2023-virgin-galactic-planning-3-space-flights-a-month-101636510387804.html
10-11-2021||World||New climate pledges not enough: Studies||Two different analyses have concluded that the new nationally determined contributions (NDCs) announced at Glasgow climate change conference last week and the statements about raising of ambitions may lead to little concrete outcomes, and global climate is still headed for a catastrophic warming of around 2.4 to 2.7°C over pre-industrial levels.The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) released an update to their emissions gap report 2021 on Tuesday, considering 33 new mitigation pledges for 2030 (31 in NDCs and 2 in other announcements as of 4 November 2021) made since September.The total number of mitigation pledges for 2030 considered is now 152, covering 88% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Since the report released on October 26, 25 additional countries have announced net-zero emissions pledges, implying that 76% of global domestic emissions are now covered by net-zero announcements.When the latest unconditional and conditional NDCs are considered, warming is projected to be limited to 2.7°C (range: 2.2°C–3.1°C) over pre-industrial levels. This means that there is no change in warming impact compared to UNEP’s assessment released on October 26. When the full implementation of all net-zero pledges are considered in addition to the updated unconditional and conditional NDCs, warming is projected to be limited to 2.1°C (range: 1.9°C–2.3°C).“Great to see countries submit stretched NDCs. But the reality is that the sum total of our #climate efforts thus far is like an elephant giving birth to a mouse. When we gavel #COP26, we need to close the leadership gap,” tweeted Inger Andersen, executive director, UNEP.During a press conference to release the updated findings Andersen flagged that most net zero pledges are vague, untransparent and hard to hold to account. She highlighted some were for GHG emissions while some only for CO2 emissions. “There is a very large credibility gap. Glasgow was the first real test of Paris Agreement’s ratcheting up mechanism. But the ambition gap is massive and unlikely to be addressed in next few days,” Andersen said.The unconditional pledges made between the September cut-off date of the Emissions Gap Report 2021 and 4 November 2021 have narrowed the gap with respect to 2°C and 1.5°C by about 0.5 GtCO2e (gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent); if the conditional pledges are also fully implemented the gap has been narrowed by about 1.5 GtCO2e.“These changes do not affect the conclusion of the Emissions Gap Report 2021 that a significant increase in 2030 mitigation pledge ambition and acceleration of action is required to get the world on a path consistent with the Paris Agreement temperature goal.Even considering the recent updated pledges for 2030, annual global GHG emissions would need to be roughly halved by 2030 to become consistent with a 1.5°C pathway,” a UNEP statement said.“Glasgow has a massive credibility, action and commitment gap as the world is heading to at least 2.4°C of warming, if not more,” the Climate Action Tracker, a scientific analysis organisation also warned at a press conference at COP26 on Tuesday.With all target pledges, including those made in Glasgow, global greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 will still be around twice as high as necessary for the 1.5°C limit, CAT states, adding that with 2030 pledges alone (without longer term net zero targets) there is likely to be warming of 2.4°C.The projected warming from current policies – what countries are actually doing – is even higher, at 2.7°C, CAT flagged. In CAT’s best case scenario when all net zero pledges are implemented, warming can be limited to around 1.8°C.A separate modelling showed one billion people will be at risk of extreme heat stress if global warming causes the world’s temperature to rise by 2°C.A study by the Met Office, the UK’s national meteorological service, warned that a 2°C rise could lead to a 15-fold increase of a potentially fatal cocktail of heat and humidity across the planet.A 4°C rise would mean that nearly half of the world’s population could be living in affected areas, according to the research.COP26 President Alok Sharma told reporters that there’s a “mountain still to climb” in the coming days and time is running out. There’s been some progress, but it’s still not enough.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-climate-pledges-not-enoughstudies-101636509238734.html

Only a handful of the original 200 were made in this way.Jobs and Wozniak mostly sold Apple-1s as component parts. One computer shop that took a delivery of around 50 units decided to encase some of them in wood, the auction house said."This is kind of the holy grail for vintage electronics and computer tech collectors," Apple-1 expert Corey Cohen told the Los Angeles Times ahead of the bidding. "That really makes it exciting for a lot of people."John Moran Auctioneers said the device, which was sold with a 1986 Panasonic video monitor, has only ever had two owners."It was originally purchased by an electronics professor at Chaffey College in Rancho Cucamonga, California, who then sold it to his student in 1977," a listing on the auction house's website said.The Los Angeles Times reported the student -- who has not been named -- paid just $650 for it at the time.While the $400,000 hammer price represents a healthy return on investment for that former student, it is a long way short of the record for such a device.A working Apple-1 that came to the market in 2014 was sold by Bonhams for more than $900,000."A lot of people just want to know what kind of a person collects Apple-1 computers and it's not just people in the tech industry," Cohen said.Apple raced to success in the late 1970s and early 1980s, but foundered after the departure of Jobs and Wozniak.The company was reinvigorated in the late 1990s, and Jobs was brought back into the fold as the chief executive.He oversaw the launch of the iPod, and later the world-changing iPhone, before his death in 2011.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/original-apple-computer-hand-built-by-jobs-and-wozniak-sells-for-400k-101636508254986.html
10-11-2021||World||Nasa pushes back timeframe for next human moon landing to 2025||Nasa is extending its target date for sending astronauts back to the moon to 2025 at the earliest, the US space agency's chief said on Tuesday, stretching out by at least a year the timeline pronounced under former President Donald Trump.\Trump's administration had set the aggressive goal of returning humans to the lunar surface by 2024, an initiative named Artemis intended as a stepping stone toward the even-more-ambitious objective of sending astronauts to Mars.Nasa administrator Bill Nelson cited delays from legal wrangling over the SpaceX contract to build the Artemis lunar landing vehicle as a major reason for extending the target date."We lost nearly seven months in litigation, and that likely has pushed the first human landing likely to no earlier than 2025," Nelson told a news conference. "We are estimating no earlier than 2025 for Artemis 3, which would be the human lander on the first demonstration landing."A federal judge last Thursday rejected a lawsuit by Jeff Bezos' space company Blue Origin against the US government challenging Nasa's decision to award a $2.9 billion lunar lander contract to rival billionaire Elon Musk's SpaceX.The ruling allows the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to resume its collaboration with SpaceX on the lander contract, though Nelson said that Musk's company had continued development work on its own in the meantime.Citing additional factors for the new timeline, Nelson said Congress had previously approved too little money for the program and that the Trump administration's "target of a 2024 human landing was not grounded in technical feasibility."Nelson, a former astronaut and US senator appointed by President Joe Biden to lead the space agency, said delays caused by the Covid-19 pandemic also played a role.Nasa had previously aimed to return crewed spacecraft to the lunar surface by 2028, after putting a "Gateway" space station into orbit around the moon by 2024.But the Trump administration, in a surprise 2019 pronouncement from then-Vice President Mike Pence, set a deadline for putting Americans back on the moon within five years "by any means necessary."At the time, Pence said the United States was in a new "space race," borrowing vocabulary from the 1960s Cold War era, to counter the potential space weaponry capabilities of Russia and China.Competing with ChinaNelson said China's space program, which has included robotic exploration https://www.reuters.com/article/space-exploration-china-moon/china-calls-launch-a-success-as-robotic-spacecraft-heads-to-moon-idUSKBN2831C5 of the lunar surface and Mars, remains an impetus for the Artemis project."We're going to be as aggressive as we can be in a safe and technically feasible way to beat out competitors with boots on the moon," he said.Since 2020, Nasa has launched three astronaut crews aboard SpaceX rocketships to the International Space Station, with a fourth such mission expected in orbit as early as this week.The US Apollo program sent six human missions to the moon from 1969 to 1972, the only crewed spaceflights yet to reach the lunar surface. The Artemis program, named for the twin sister of Apollo and goddess of the hunt and moon in Greek mythology, is aimed at eventually establishing a long-term human colony on the moon as a precursor to sending astronauts to Mars.Under the latest frame outlined by Nelson, the very first Artemis mission, an uncrewed test flight of the Orion capsule and the new heavy-lift Space Launch System (SLS) rocket that will send it aloft, is targeted for liftoff in February 2022.The first crewed flight of the SLS-Orion spacecraft would come no later than May 2024, a mission that would take astronauts some 40,000 miles beyond the moon - farther than humans have ever flown - and return them to Earth, Nelson said.He said the initial human Artemis landing, now expected no sooner than 2025, would also be preceded at some unspecified date by an uncrewed landing. Nasa has said the first Artemis crewed moon landing will include at least one woman, with a person of color on either that mission or the next. Both would be firsts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasa-pushes-back-timeframe-for-next-human-moon-landing-to-2025-101636507028589.html

The launch was originally scheduled for Tuesday, as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) had planned to have a change of guard with the Crew-2 astronauts greeting the Crew-3 team before the former departed, but Nasa switched the order in view of the weather concerns and an astronaut's undisclosed medical condition.Four astronauts from the second team were already brought back on Monday and the task of welcoming the third crew now falls to the lone American and two Russians left behind at the space station.Also Read | NASA, SpaceX delay sending 4 astronauts to ISS due to bad weatherIn a tweet, SpaceX informed that launch conditions for the Crew-3 mission are mostly advantageous on Wednesday, with the weather forecast being 80 per cent favourable for lift-off. “Following Crew-2's return to Earth, Falcon 9 will launch Dragon’s third long-duration crew mission to the @Space_Station as soon as Wednesday, November 10; weather forecast is 80% favorable for liftoff,” posted SpaceX from its official handle on Twitter, earlier this week.Following Crew-2’s return to Earth, Falcon 9 will launch Dragon’s third long-duration crew mission to the @Space_Station as soon as Wednesday, November 10; weather forecast is 80% favorable for liftoff pic.twitter.com/xOFGVw3fOPElon Musk's SpaceX, as part of Nasa's commercial crew programme, has been sending out operational crewed flights to outer space to bring astronauts to and from the ISS. Crew-3 is the third of such operational crewed flight for SpaceX; the agency had first sent two Nasa astronauts to the ISS back in May 2020.Meanwhile, the four astronauts from the Crew-2 mission returned to Earth on Monday, riding home with SpaceX to end a 200-day space station mission that began last spring. Their homecoming — coming just eight hours after leaving the International Space Station — paved the way for SpaceX's launch of their four replacements.This next crew will also spend six months up there in space, welcoming back-to-back groups of tourists.

Fighting in the yearlong conflict between the federal army and the Tigray People’s Liberation Front has escalated since the start of October, with the rebels advancing steadily south.The Ethiopian Human Rights Commission said on Nov. 8 that the government was detaining people “in a manner that appeared to be based on identity and ethnicity,” following widespread arrests after the state of emergency was declared.UN security officers “have visited the detained colleagues,” Farhan Haq, another UN spokesman, said earlier on Tuesday. Formal requests have “also been sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs” seeking “the immediate release of the detained personnel.”A U.S. special envoy, diplomat Jeffrey Feltman, is in Ethiopia to try to advance talks on ending the civil war.

At least 14 nuclear units are under construction with installed capacity reaching 15.53 GW.Russia, several east European countries, Switzerland and Sweden have all had nuclear-fuelled district heating schemes, and heat from nuclear power plants has also been sent to industrial sites in several countries, the WNN report added.In June, Beijing said there had been no leak at the Taishan nuclear power station in southern China after CNN reported that Framatome, the French company that designed the reactors, had said that China’s nuclear safety regulator had raised limits on permissible levels of radiation outside the plant in Guangdong to avoid having to shut it down.The Chinese ecology and environment ministry said the allegation was “erroneous”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-homes-of-200-000-residents-in-haiyang-now-fully-heated-by-nuclear-power-101636467847549.html

This reflects the improvement in international arrivals owing to factors such as vaccination advances around the world,” Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority said.India, the UK, Pakistan, Russia and Germany were the top five international tourist generating markets during October, it said.“India was the largest source of tourist visits to Sri Lanka with 37 per cent of the total traffic received in October. The UK and Pakistan accounted for 10 per cent and 9 per cent of the total traffic respectively," the Tourism Development Authority said.The growth in arrivals from countries in the Americas, and Western, Central and Eastern Europe, suggests a slight revitalisation of leisure tourism, potentially enabled by factors such as the gradual improvement of traveller confidence, the lifting of travel restrictions, it said.As of October 31, a total number of 60,695 tourists had visited Sri Lanka, this year. It is a decline of 88 per cent over the last year when 507,311 tourists had visited the country from January to March 18.Sri Lanka's economy has been hit by the Covid-19 pandemic which has led to a slump in the arrival of foreign tourists to the island nation. The country has so far reported 545,935 confirmed cases and 13,875 deaths due to the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-largest-source-of-foreign-tourists-in-sri-lanka-uk-pakistan-in-top-5-101636462310500.html
