23-11-2021||World||Europe Covid resurgence: WHO fears 700,000 more deaths||Europe remains "in the firm grip" of Covid and the death toll on the continent could top 2.2 million this winter if current trends continue, the World Health Organization said Tuesday.Some 700,000 could die in the coming months, the WHO said, as cases creep up across Europe, prompting some countries to reimpose tough restrictions.The WHO expects "high or extreme stress in intensive care units (ICUs) in 49 out of 53 countries between now and March 1, 2022"."Cumulative reported deaths are projected to reach over 2.2 million by spring next year," it added, up from the current 1.5 million.Covid-19 is the leading cause of death across Europe and Central Asia, the WHO reported, citing figures from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.The rise in Europe was being driven by a combination of the highly-contagious Delta variant, insufficient vaccination coverage and the easing of measures such as mask wearing and physical distancing, it said.According to WHO data, Covid-related deaths increased last week to nearly 4,200 a day, doubling from 2,100 deaths a day at the end of September.The WHO also said evidence was growing that vaccine-induced protection against infection and mild disease was declining."The Covid-19 situation across Europe and Central Asia is very serious. We face a challenging winter ahead," regional director for WHO Europe, Hans Kluge, said in a statement.He called for a "vaccine plus" approach, consisting of vaccinations, social distancing, the use of face masks and hand washing.The WHO said face masks reduce Covid incidence by 53 percent according to a recent study, and "over 160,000 deaths could be prevented (by March 1) if universal mask coverage of 95 percent was achieved".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-covid-resurgence-who-fears-700-000-more-deaths-101637675596499.html

23-11-2021||World||To ward off another Covid-19 wave, Israel vaccinates children as young as 5||Israel began rolling out Covid-19 vaccines for children aged five to 11 on Monday, becoming one of a handful of countries to inoculate children so young as it seeks to ward off another pandemic wave.Over the summer, the Jewish state experienced an upsurge in coronavirus infections, fuelled by the Delta variant, and launched one of the earliest campaigns for booster shots.As infections start to creep up again, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett has said the country is experiencing a "children's wave" with about half of the recently confirmed cases among children below the age of 11, he wrote on Facebook.Authorities had already begun immunising those aged 12 to 17 but decided to lower the age threshold in the wake of trials by Pfizer and recommendations from a panel of Israeli scientists.While the campaign for younger minors was set to officially start Tuesday, doses were already being administered by Monday night, an AFP team in Tel Aviv found."Right now during the epidemic, the best tool to protect our children is vaccination," said Heli Nave from outside a clinic giving the Pfizer-BioNTech jabs to children.She said "it is not an easy decision at all" but the availability of data from the United States -- which started immunising five-to-11-year-olds earlier this month -- had convinced her.The prime minister is scheduled to have his own youngest son vaccinated on Tuesday morning, his office announced.Israel was one of the first countries to launch vaccines against the coronavirus last year thanks to a deal with Pfizer that gave it access to millions of doses in exchange for data on the vaccine's efficacy.More than 5.7 million of the country's nine million people are now fully vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/to-ward-off-another-covid-19-wave-israel-vaccinates-children-as-young-as-5-101637637964343.html
23-11-2021||World||Peng Shuai has appeared in public, but concerns about her safety not going away||Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai appeared in public over the weekend, after increasing calls about her whereabouts from across the world. Several videos and pictures released by China's state-controlled media showed Peng going about her life in Beijing; she even spoke to the chief of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) Thomas Bach on Sunday.But all this hasn't stopped the voices of concerns from being raised about her safety in China."It was good to see Peng Shuai in recent videos, but they don't alleviate or address the WTA's concern about her well-being and ability to communicate without censorship or coercion," a Women's Tennis Association's (WTA) spokeswoman said in an e-mail response to news agency Reuters.The IOC released a photo of Bach facing a screen on which Peng appears but did not release video of the call. The IOC's short statement, which offered few details and no follow-up on her allegations, is leading to increasing criticism of the sports body.Amnesty International's China researcher Alkan Akad told Reuters the video call did little to alleviate fears over Peng's well-being."The International Olympic Committee is entering dangerous waters," Akad said. "In the past we have seen various similar cases where people had no option but to say what they had been told to."Some critics say the IOC's handling of the call with Peng makes it an active partner in delivering Beijing’s message - while not providing Peng with an open forum to discuss her allegations.French sports minister Roxana Maracineanu's office said she "is partly reassured by the video but remains concerned and wants the light to be shed on the accusations of sexual assault".The United Kingdom on Monday demanded that Beijing allow her to speak out without fear of repercussions.Meanwhile, Hu Xijin, the editor of the state-owned newspaper Global Times who has in recent days posted videos and photographs of Peng in Beijing, said on Twitter on Monday that her appearance should be enough to ease worries of "those who truly care about (the) safety of Peng Shuai".Peng disappeared from public view after publishing on November 2 a statement on Weibo, China's Twitter-like social media platform, accusing the former Chinese vice-premier, 75-year-old Zhang Gaoli, of sexually assaulting her. The post was immediately deleted, Peng's accounts were removed from the Chinese social networks and the athlete stopped communicating, raising concerns for her safety.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/peng-shuai-has-appeared-in-public-but-concerns-about-her-safety-not-going-away-101637634355216.html
23-11-2021||World||'Broader efforts to silence all criticism': Human rights group raises concern over Taliban crackdown on Afghan media||The Human Rights Watch (HRW) on Monday (local time) raised concerns regarding the imposition of strict new media guidelines in Afghanistan by the Taliban that especially harm women.The HRW in a statement said Taliban intelligence officials have issued death threats against journalists who have criticized Taliban officials and have required journalists to submit all reports for approval before publication.New guidelines from the Vice and Virtue Ministry dictate the dress of female journalists on television and prohibit soap operas and entertainment programs featuring female actors, the rights group said."The Taliban's new media regulations and threats against journalists reflect broader efforts to silence all criticism of Taliban rule," said Patricia Gossman, associate Asia director at HRW. "The disappearance of any space for dissent and worsening restrictions for women in the media and arts is devastating."Also Read| Taliban asks Afghan TV channels to stop airing shows with women actorsSeveral journalists said that they have been summoned by local officials immediately after publishing reports on Taliban abuses. One journalist who had reported complaints about Taliban searching houses and beating people said that the deputy governor called him into his office and told him that if he broadcast anything like that again, "He would hang me in the town square."Other media staff have reported that heavily armed Taliban intelligence officials visited their offices and warned journalists not to use the word "Taliban" in their reporting but to refer to the "Islamic Emirate" in all publications.Last week, the Taliban's Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice prohibited broadcasting any films deemed to be "against Islamic or Afghan values," along with soap operas and dramas featuring women actors, and made the hijab - a head covering exposing the face - compulsory for women television journalists.Also Read| Islamic State expanding to nearly all Afghan provinces, warns UN envoyThe Taliban have also pressed the media, especially in the provinces, to publish the reports they want and have ordered journalists in some instances to interview them, the rights group said. One journalist said: "After they threatened us with death, we published what they said. Now we broadcast Quranic verses at the beginning of the programs and naat [Islamic songs] because we fear for our safety."Many media outlets have closed their offices out of fear and are publishing only online. "Despite the Taliban's promises to allow media that 'respected Islamic values' to function, the reality for Afghanistan is that journalists live in fear of a knock on the door or a summons from the authorities," Gossman said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/human-rights-group-raises-concern-over-taliban-crackdown-on-afghan-media-101637631627380.html
23-11-2021||World||US hospitals at ‘breaking point’ as Covid-19 rebounds in multiple areas||The United States is currently seeing a rebound in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases, reported the Bloomberg news agency, adding that the surge is driven by the fast-spreading Delta variant, which has taken a toll on the country's already-stressed healthcare system despite the relatively widespread availability of vaccines. The Covid-19 rebound seen in several parts of the country is just as bad as last November's, according to data compiled by the agency from the US department of health and human services.Also Read | Rising cases in US, Europe fuel another global surgePatients with confirmed or suspected cases of Covid-19 are taking up more ICU beds than a year earlier in as many as 15 states – with Colorado, Minnesota, and Michigan showing the highest hospitalisation (under intensive care) rates so far, 41 per cent, 37 per cent, and 34 per cent, respectively.Michigan, which currently has the highest per-capita case rate in the US, has however not issued any new restrictions on public gatherings, instead encouraging more citizens to mask up and get vaccinated. “Many of our physicians are at a breaking point,” Ali Mokdad, a professor with the University of Washington’s institute for health metrics and evaluation, was quoted as saying. “It’s not easy to be a day in and day out in an emergency room, in an ICU, looking at someone who is dying because he or she is not vaccinated.”Also Read | US announces launch of global Covid-19 tracker portalSince staffed ICU beds in many areas remain occupied by patients with confirmed or suspected Covid-19 cases, there's proportionately less space in the hospitals for those suffering from other ailments, many of them potentially deadly. The situation particularly bodes ill news for the Northeast states, where cases began surging a few weeks after the Midwest and the Rocky Mountains.After about two months of declining infections, the US has been reporting daily increases for the past two weeks, driven by the more easily transmitted Delta variant of the virus and people spending more time indoors due to colder weather. According to experts, protection instilled by vaccines is waning, and the country could face yet another major wave of the pandemic this winter.Meanwhile, US regulators expanded eligibility for booster shots of Covid-19 vaccines to all adults last Friday, allowing millions of Americans to get additional protection against the virus amid a recent rise in infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-hospitals-at-breaking-point-as-covid-19-rebounds-in-multiple-areas-101637628253358.html
23-11-2021||World||Afghanistan's banking system on verge of collapse, warns UNDP report||A new UN report on Monday said Afghanistan's banking and financial systems are on the verge of collapse following the country's takeover by the Taliban."Afghanistan's financial and bank payment systems are in disarray," the report by UN Development Program (UNDP) said. "The bank-run problem must be resolved quickly to improve Afghanistan's limited production capacity and prevent the banking system from collapsing."Soon after the Taliban assumed power in Kabul, the United States froze Afghanistan's international reserves. This has led to a dramatic shock in the country's financial and payment systems.Currently, the country's central bank could not meet deposit demands, prompting the Taliban to impose withdrawal caps of a maximum of USD 200 per week. The amount was recently increased to USD 400, Sputnik reported.The report said that Afghanistan's total banking system deposits fell to USD 2 billion in September from USD 2.8 billion at the end of 2020.With the current pace and withdrawal restrictions, deposits are projected to fall to USD 1.7 billion by the end of 2021, likely leading to the collapse of Afghanistan's banking sector, the report said."Without the banking sector, there's no humanitarian solution for Afghanistan," UNDP Resident Representative Abdallah Al Dardari said. "Do we really want to see Afghans completely isolated?"In addition, the country's credit market is also in decline. Total credits fell to USD 307 million in September from USD 33 billion at the end of last year.To prevent the collapse of the country's banking system, UNDP urged for prompt and decisive action, which includes deposit insurance for depositors, adequate liquidity for the banking system and credit guarantees and loan repayment delay options.

23-11-2021||World||Bibi obsessed with image, court told||Israel’s former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu sought “total and complete” control over his media image, his ex-spokesman told the graft trial of the veteran leader on Monday.“If we use the term ‘control freak,’ he is much more than that,” said Nir Hefetz. “In everything relating to the media, he demands to know everything, down to the smallest detail.”The testimony of Hefetz, seen as a key prosecution witness in Israel’s highest-profile trial, had been postponed from last week at the request of Netanyahu’s legal team.Netanyahu - who was Israel’s longest serving prime minister, including a record 12-year tenure from 2009 to 2021, and now head of the opposition - has been charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust.The indictments collectively accuse him of accepting improper gifts and illegally trading regulatory favour with media moguls in exchange for positive coverage.Hefetz said in his district court testimony that Netayahu’s “control over everything relating to media matters and his social media channels could not be higher”.“Netanyahu spends at least as much as his time on media as he spends on security matters, including on matters an outsider would consider nonsense.”The session focused on Netanyahu allegedly granting favours to Shaul Elovitch, then-head of Israel’s largest telecom company, Bezeq, in exchange for favourable coverage by its Walla news website.Netanyahu is accused of offering regulatory benefits that could have been worth millions to the company in return for the politically advantageous coverage. Hefetz said that in 2015, shortly before elections, Elovitch contacted him regularly to lobby for governmental approval of his group’s merger with cable TV operator Yes, and to find out who would be the next communications minister.“I think he (Elovitch) was thinking at the time: who knows who will win; so the Yes deal had to be signed first,” Hefetz said.Netanyahu left after the first few hours of testimony Monday after receiving permission from the court.His trial formally began in 2020, while the country was embroiled in a two-year-long political crisis that saw four repeated elections. The trial is expected to take years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bibi-obsessed-with-image-court-told-101637619421383.html

23-11-2021||World||Europe sees protests against Covid curbs||In the face of demonstrations across much of Europe protesting tough Covid-19 measures over the past days, authorities on Monday pleaded for patience, calm and a willingness to get vaccinations as infections spike upward again. Protest marches from Zagreb to Rome and from Vienna to Brussels and Rotterdam, bringing tens of thousands out, all had one message from a coronavirus-weary crowd - we’ve had enough!Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte on Monday lashed out at “idiot” rioters who rampaged through cities across the Netherlands this weekend when protests against coronavirus policies turned violent. More than 100 people were arrested during three nights of violence, which saw police open fire at rioters in Rotterdam on Friday.“This was pure violence disguised as protest,” Rutte said.Scenes were ugly too at the end of the Brussels protest march, with rioters pelting police, who then used tear gas and water cannons to break up the crowds. “Our goal today is to fight against the virus. Please, let us not get incited by a small group which would turn it into a fight against one another,” said Belgian PM Alexander De Croo.The EU pointed out that scientific evidence shows that increased vaccinations would contain the crisis and avoid more deaths. “You know the three words very well — vaccinate, vaccinate, vaccinate,” said spokesman Stefan De KeersmaeckerThe protests come as a fourth wave of infections is locking down Austrians and forcing renewed restraints in many European nations.Austria, which woke up on Monday to its fourth national lockdown since the start of the pandemic, is threatening fines of up to 3,600 ($4,000) for people who refuse shots once mandatory inoculations kick in 2022.Slovakia is mulling the possibility of declaring a three-week full lockdown. Premier Eduard Heger is “intensively” considering this option for the country, which is currently among the most hit in new cases in the world on per capita basis.Germany’s latest surge in Covid-19 infections is worse than anything the country has experienced so far, Chancellor Angela Merkel said, calling for tighter restrictions. Austria, which went into its fourth national lockdown on Monday, is threatening fines of up to $4,000 for people who refuse a shot once mandatory inoculations kick in next year.Denmark’s consumers turned pessimistic for the first time in seven months in November after the Nordic country reintroduced some restrictions to fight a rising infections. Daily infections are up by a factor of about 10 since the country ended restrictions in September.Meanwhile, two bodies set up to advise the French government on its handling of the Covid-19 crisis have recommended making booster shots, currently only offering boosters to people over 65, available to all adults.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-sees-protests-against-covid-curbs-101637619075175.html
23-11-2021||World||Waukesha: Driver to be charged with ‘intentional homicide’ after ramming car on Christmas parade||The driver of the car that plowed into a Christmas parade in the Midwestern US city of Waukesha, killing five and injuring 48, was apparently fleeing a domestic dispute at the time -- and will face charges of intentional homicide, police said Monday.Waukesha, Wisconsin police chief Dan Thompson said that suspect Darrell Brooks, 39, appeared to be fleeing a domestic disturbance and was not being pursued by police when he drove his red SUV through the city's annual holiday parade on Sunday.Four women and one man between the ages of 52 and 81 were killed, and 48 people were hospitalized, Thompson said.Of those sent to hospitals, 18 were children, according to Dr. Amy Drendel, the head of emergency medicine at Children's Wisconsin hospital.Two have been discharged, but six remain in "critical condition," Dr. Michael Meyer, head of the hospital's critical care division, said.Thompson also said there appeared to be no motive for the disaster, other than that Brooks had driven away from some kind of confrontation as police were called to the scene.He did not confirm reports the confrontation had involved a knife fight.'We are confident he acted alone. There is no evidence that this was a terrorist incident," Thompson said of Brooks."There was no pursuit that led to this incident," he added.In Washington, President Joe Biden offered words of support to a community stunned by a "horrific act of violence," and paid his respects to families "facing the fresh grief of a life without a loved one."Waukesha Mayor Shawn Reilly called it a "senseless tragedy" that affected the entire city west of Milwaukee, as it held its nearly six-decade-old parade to kick off the Thanksgiving-to-Christmas holiday season."Last night, lives were lost at what should have been a celebration," Reilly said.Lost shoes and spilled hot chocolate The tragedy had raised immediate fears of a deliberate act -- in a state where tensions have spiked following a high-profile acquittal in the racially charged trial of Kyle Rittenhouse, a teen who fatally shot two people during Black Lives Matter protests in nearby Kenosha last year.Brooks is from nearby Milwaukee, where he already faces multiple charges from July 2020 of recklessly endangering the safety of others and firearms violations, as well as from earlier this month for a domestic abuse incident.Corey Montiho, a school district board member in the Milwaukee suburb, was near a restaurant when he heard that his daughter's youth dance team had been struck."There were pom-poms and shoes and spilled hot chocolate everywhere," he was quoted as saying by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel."I had to go from one crumpled body to the other to find my daughter. My wife and two daughters were almost hit."Reilly said the city would hold a prayer vigil this evening, and Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers ordered flags across the state lowered to half-staff."We continue to pray for the Waukesha community and the kids, loved ones, and neighbors whose lives were forever changed by an unthinkable tragedy last night," Evers tweeted Monday.'Deafening cries'While police confirmed at least five deaths and 48 injured, there were fears the toll may yet rise, and the city was left in shock.Witnesses described a terrifying scene on Main Street, where school bands and other groups were marching before bundled-up spectators lining the road.Sandra Peterson, a spokeswoman for the Milwaukee Catholic church, said one of its priests was injured, "as well as multiple parishioners and Waukesha Catholic school children."Witness Angela O'Boyle, whose apartment overlooked the parade, told CNN: "All I heard was screaming and then people yelling out their children's names."A total of 11 adults and 18 children were taken to six area hospitals, Fire Chief Steven Howard said.Schools and city hall remained closed Monday, and the schools would be closed again on Tuesday, officials said.Angelito Tenorio, running for Wisconsin state treasurer, told the Journal Sentinel that he "saw an SUV cross over, just put the pedal to the metal and just zooming full speed along the parade route.""And then we heard a loud bang, and just deafening cries and screams."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/waukesha-driver-to-be-charged-with-intentional-homicide-after-ramming-car-on-christmas-parade-101637609852206.html
23-11-2021||World||HT This Day: Nov 23, 1963 – President Kennedy is assassinated||Dallas, Texas – President Kennedy died here today from an assassin’s bullet.The 46-year-old President was riding in a motorcade with his wife Jackie, when three shots were fired and he was hit in the head.He was rushed to hospital and given a blood transfusion but died shortly afterwards, at 1 p.m. local time (0030 IST Saturday).Mr Kennedy lived for 25 minutes after an unknown assassin had cut him down with rifle fire.A late NBC report said the President was shot once in the head.Police were reported to have taken possession of a rifle of a non-American make. A youth was reported to have been picked up.Vice-President Lyndon Johnson assumed the full constitutional responsibilities of the presidency immediately on the death of Mr Kennedy and before taking an oath of office.Hunt for assassinFBI Chief Edgar Hoover ordered an all-out manhunt for the assassin or assassins A youth was later reported to have been picked up. Police believed the fatal shots were fired by a white man.The murder weapon was believed to be a 30-30 high calibre rifle. The President was shot as his open car passed near an intersection in the main business area of the city.As the shots rang out, Mr Kennedy fell face down in the back of the car.Mrs Kennedy cried “Oh, No” and tried to hold his head.Governor Connally, who was also hit by bullets, slumped on the seat.Police rushed the car to a nearby hospital.Pandemonium broke out but secret service agents waved the motorcade onto a road which led to the Parkland Hospital where he was earlier scheduled to deliver a speech. Within five minutes the President's car pulled up at the hospital entrance.Hospital officials in the emergency ward gave the President a transfusion of B positive blood from the bank.Mr Kennedy was then given last sacraments.The announcement of Mr Kennedy’s death brought cries and moans from the crowd gathered outside the hospital.Senator Ralph Yarborough of Texas collapsed as he described the shooting to newsmen.Governor Connally underwent an operation for a bullet wound in the chest half an hour after President Kennedy's death.Mrs Lyndon Johnson denied a report that the Vice-President had been hurt. "He is fine." she told newsmen.Three shotsA woman who said she was a spectator of the shooting, said in a radio interview that the President and Mrs Kennedy were looking at a dog in the middle of the street when the shots rang out."There were three shots. He grabbed his chest and fell over his seat and Jackie fell over him," Mrs Jean Hill said."The shots came from a hill just east of the underpass." An eye-witness said he saw a gun emerge from an upper storey of a warehouse commanding an unobstructed view of the Presidential car.Mr Kennedy was the first President to be assassinated since William McKinley was shot in 1901.It was the first death of a President in office since Franklin D. Roosevelt succumbed to a cerebral hemorrhage at Warm Springs, Georgie, in April 1945.A radio report from the scene said a white man and a Negro boy had reported seeing a man in a window with what appeared to be a gun.Some residents of Dallas expressed surprise that the triple overpass was not guarded by police.The President, concerned about his unpopularity in the south over his Civil Rights Bill, arrived in Texas yesterday with Mrs Kennedy to win support and close the divided ranks of the Texas Democrats.The New York Stock Exchange remained closed.A secret serviceman and a DalIas policeman were shot dead some distance from where Mr Kennedy was assassinated.Early lifeJohn Fitzgerald ci Kennedy was born on May 29, 1917, in Brookline, a suburb of Boston. America had just entered the war. For several years the family lived in a large frame house set back from the sidewalk on a small plot. It was a quiet, lower-middle-class area.But the pleasant Boston days were soon over. Joseph Kennedy had outgrown his native city, and he settled his family near the centre of New York, in Bronxville. It was an affluent place surrounded by broad lawns. Young John went to nearby Riverdale School; the teachers remembered him as a slight boy, polite, industrious, and likable, with a special interest in English history.Even as a boy, Kennedy showed some of the skill at persuasion that would mark his political career later.At thirteen Kennedy left his Bronxville home for boarding school. For a year he went to Canterbury School in Connecticut, the only Catholic school he ever attended. He showed early a trait that baffles his staff today-an almost photographic memory for correspondence, conversations, and historical fact, but an almost total absent-mindedness about where he has mislaid speeches, books, and clothing. Always a ready competitor he tried out for football, baseball, and other sports with fair success. He could swim fifty yards in thirty seconds; this swimming skill would save his life years later.The next fall he shifted to Choate, a select private school, where Adlai Stevenson and Chester Bowles had been students. Joe Jr. was there making out well. The boys' father chose Choate because he wanted them to mix and compete with a greater variety of boys.In his senior year at Choate, he wrote his father that he had "definitely decided to stop fooling around. I really do realize how important it is that I get a good job done this year, if I want to go to England, I really feel that I have been bluffing myself about how much real work I have been doing.""Now Jack, I don't want to give the impression that I am a nagger," the father wrote. "After long experience in sizing up people I definitely know you have the goods and you can go a long way ...After all, I would be lacking even as a friend if I did not urge you to take advantage of the qualities you have.I am not expecting too much and I will not be disappointed if you don't turn out to be a real genius, but I think you can be a really worthwhile citizen with good judgment and good understanding. . …Graduate at 18The father encouraged political argument at the dinner table. He asserted his views strongly, but did not force his views.Kennedy became an omnivorous reader during these school years, but history and stories of famous men, rather than current affairs, were his favourites.At eighteen he graduated from Choate. At the end of 1937, when Jack was still in his sophomore year, President Roosevelt appointed Joseph Kennedy ambassador to Britain.Jack Kennedy's last two years at Harvard fell in the shadow of tumultuous world affairs. About the time he began his junior year, in September 1938, Neveille Chamberlain yielded Czechoslovakia to Adolf Hitler at Munich. Thousands of young men of his age were leaving school and work; millions more would soon follow.Young Kennedy watched restlessly while Europe girded for war. Eager to see the tension points at first hand, he won permission from Harvard to spend the second semester in Europe. After spring in Paris, he went to Poland, then to Riga, Russia, Turkey, Palestine and back to the Balkan, Berlin, and Paris.The long-gathering storm burst over Europe soon after Kennedy concluded his tour.Kennedy was still a college student and classes were beginning at Harvard. Later in the month he sailed for home.To gain such honours he needed to submit an undergraduate thesis, and this was Kennedy's main intellectual effort during his senior year. His subject was "Appeasement at Munich."The thesis had two arresting qualities. One was Kennedy's emotional detachment from the crisis he described.As Kennedy handed his dissertation in to Professor Hopper in the spring of 1940, events in Europe dramatized his thesis of democracy's weakness. Germany smashed through Dutch and Belgian defences, cut to pieces French infantry corps, and pinned British troops against the sea at Dunkirk. France was gone; Britain was in grave danger. Churchill was now leading the British. But would America wake in time?In June Kennedy was graduated from Harvard amid the traditional pomp and pageantry. But all the bands and songs could not drown out the roar from abroad.Kennedy moved near to direct involvement in the war. He tried to enlist in the Army but was rejected because of his old back condition. He went through five months of strengthening exercises, and managed to pass a Navy fitness test in September. When Pearl Harbour came he applied for sea duty.Early in 1943, he shipped out from San Francisco for the South Pacific, where Allied forces were beginning to turn back the Japanese advance.Shortly after midnight on August 2, 1943, the Japanese destroyer Amagiri cut through the dark waters of Blackett Strait west of New Georgia. The commander of the destroyer peered through the waves. A wave tore Kennedy from the canoe and spun him around and down, but miraculously he landed not on coral but in an eddy.His ordeal was almost over. In the morning island natives awakened them. One said in English, "I have a letter for you, sir." It was from the commander of a New Zealand infantry patrol on New Geogria urging them to follow the islanders back to his camp.The Navy bestowed official recognition when it awarded to him, in addition to the Purple Heart, the Navy and Marine Corps Medal. The citation in part read: "His courage, endurance and excellent leadership contributed to the saying of several lives and was (in) keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service."The rest of the war for Kennedy was anticlimatic and studded with frustration and tragedy. He contracted malaria. His flip-flop on his back after the PT boat explosion had aggravated his old back injury, and this caused him a good deal of pain. In December 1943, he was sent back to the States.As reporterHe tried his hand at journalism once again by reporting the British election from London in the summer. After that he had had enough of reporting. The war was coming to an end in the Pacific. Thousands of demobilized soldiers were streaming back home. Most of them had formed plans for civilian life. But not Jack Kennedy. By the age of twenty-eight he had earned a B.A. degree, learned how to swim and to sail; had written a successful book, travelled extensively and learned courage and endurance in the war. But the man and the political leader was unformed; his political views and his personality were still is the making.On the PT boat, Lt. John F. Kennedy, skipper, and his twelve officers and men, watched helplessly as the destroyer bore down on them. Two men were killed outright; others struggled to keep afloat and away from the gasoline fire burning on the water. Kennedy was thrown hard in the cockpit and fell on his back.Kennedy decided to strike out on his own to a further island and try to intercept a PT boat along the regular route through Ferguson Passage. He swam to the reef, hugging the ship's lantern.During the summer of 1941 as the war drew to an end in Japan, Kennedy restlessly pondered his prospects. He was undecided. He still toyed with the notion of making a career of journalism; and was also attracted to academic life. On the other hand, newspaper work was an undependable trade, and he had no graduate degree for teaching. Business lured him not at all.He had mixed feelings about a political career. He liked the idea of being part of the top circles of government-making decisions, working on legislation, handling affairs of state, But he was not sure that he would like politics at the level where he would have to start. He disliked the blarney, the exuberant backslapping and handshaking, the exaggerated claims and denunciations that went with politics.Some of his friends, knowing he was looking around urged him to run for statewide office--Kennedy was cool to the idea; he far preferred office in Washington to Boston. Kennedy decided to make the run for the Democratic nomination for Congress. In this district the Democratic nomination was equivalent to election.Kennedy was only twenty-eight. Reserved, gaunt, almost emaciated-looking, he was a polar opposite to the familiar image of the derby-hatted, loud-talking, paunchy Boston politician. Many of the latter did not take the young candidate very seriously.Kennedy got into the race early. He campaigned for several months before the other candidates jumped off from the starting line. And in the process he began to build a big personal organization. It was this group that was responsible for Kennedy's victory.During his first two years in Congress. Kennedy seldom spoke upon foreign policy. He strongly backed the Truman Doctrine for aid to Greece and Turkey, and also supported the Marshall Plan bill authorizing aid to Western Europe.During his first term of office, violent shifts took place in the world situation. America began large-scale foreign aid and the airlift saved Berlin. By the end of 1948, the situation in Europe seemed stabilized. In China, by late 1948, the Communist armies of former library assistant at Peking University, Mao Tse-tung, were overwhelming Nationalist forces. Chiang Kai-shek's divisions were melting away. Affairs came to a climax in January 1949, when Chiang gave up the fight and prepared his retreat to Formosa.In 1952 he ran for the Senate and defeated the incumbent Republican senator Henry Cabot Lodge, the present U.S. Representative to the United Nations.In 1958 he was re-elected to the Senate with a resounding lead of 874,000 votes, the greatest majority known in the political history of Massachusetts.PresidentBy 1958 Kennedy has become a National celebrity. But in the critical Presidential election year 1960 he did not still come up to the accepted tests of Presidential timber.He was a protestant; he was not a governor of a large estate or cabinet. He was not a long time party leader. He did not personify any national issue.But his election machinery tried in earlier years stood him in good stead and he won.As was to be expected President Kennedy because of his youth came like a fresh breeze on the world scene.The administration of "new frontiers men" tried hard not to think in terms of the cold war. It immediately came upon a huge crop of problems in Laos, Congo, Latin America, Africa and China.The crucial test, however, came with the Cuban crisis last year which coincided with the Chinese invasion of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ht-this-day-nov-23-1963-president-kennedy-is-assassinated-101637607574721.html
23-11-2021||World||Amid rising Covid infections, German health minister issues stark warning||Germany's health minister said Monday that the rapid rise in coronavirus cases means it's likely everyone in the country who isn't vaccinated will have caught Covid-19 by the end of the winter — and some of those will die.Official figures Monday showed more than 30,000 newly confirmed cases in Germany over the past 24 hours — an increase of about 50% compared to one week ago. The country is this week expected to pass 100,000 coronavirus-related deaths since the start of the pandemic.Hospitals warn that ICU capacities are nearly exhausted, with some patients having to be transferred to clinics in other parts of Germany.To reduce the risk of serious illness, Health Minister Jens Spahn urged Germans to get vaccinated, including with booster shots if their first round of inoculation occurred more than six months ago.“By the end of this winter pretty much everyone in Germany (...) will have been vaccinated, recovered or died,” Spahn told reporters in Berlin.He acknowledged that some would consider this view to be cynical. “But it's true. With the highly contagious delta variant this is very, very likely and that's why we are recommending vaccination so urgently,” said Spahn.Spahn said some 50 million doses of the Moderna and BioNtech-Pfizer vaccines will be made available for the rest of the year to allow people to get first, second or third shots, as necessary. To achieve this, Germany is holding back tens of millions of doses originally intended for poor countries. Those missing doses will be provided at a later date, he said.Some politicians in Germany have suggested the country may need to consider compulsory vaccinations, like its neighbor Austria.About 68% of Germany's population of 83 million has been fully vaccinated. The German government has said it wants to push that rate above 75% to effectively curb the spread of the virus, but a sizeable minority in the population has resisted calls to take the shot.Karl Lauterbach, a prominent lawmaker with the center-left Social Democrats, called for a “radical” application of rules requiring people to present vaccination or recovery certificates to access some stores and public places.“A general vaccine mandate (shouldn't be) taboo either,” he said on Twitter.Bavaria's conservative governor, Markus Soeder, said Monday that he favors mandatory vaccines for all, too.Soeder acknowledged that such a move would infringe on civil liberties, but argued that this needed to be balanced against the need to protect the health of the population and preserve other freedoms.“That's why we believe that only a general vaccine mandate offers a durable solution,” he said.But a spokesman for outgoing German Chancellor Angela Merkel made clear that her government had no plans to tackle the thorny issue of vaccine mandates.“There is no decision about this now and it wouldn’t be taken by this government anymore,” Steffen Seibert told reporters in Berlin.A center-left coalition of three parties is expected to finalize negotiations on forming a government in early December.Bavaria, which required all citizens to get vaccinated against smallpox in 1807, currently has the second-highest Covid-19 infection rates behind Saxony to the northeast. The doctors' association there said Saxony needs to prepare for a system of triage to manage the few remaining ICU beds in the state.Gernot Marx, the head of Germany's intensive care association DIVI, said many hospitals in hard-hit regions have begun postponing scheduled surgery.He noted that the country has about 4,000 fewer ICU beds available than a year ago because large numbers of medical staff quit their jobs because of the intense strain of working during the pandemic.A senior doctor at Berlin's Charite hospital, Steffen Weber-Carstens, said the city of 3.6 million had only 89 free ICU beds left Monday.Despite high infection rates among children, schools remain open in Germany.Spahn, the health minister, said he expects the European Union to approve vaccines against Covid-19 for children aged 5-11 at the end of the week.The EU will begin shipping vaccines adjusted for younger children on Dec. 20, with Germany initially getting 2.4 million doses, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-rising-covid-infections-german-health-minister-issues-stark-warning-101637595837525.html
23-11-2021||World||India-based Ustad Sayyaf being seen as leader of anti-Taliban forces||Abdul Rasul Sayyaf, an India-based former mujahideen commander and member of parliament, is being seen as a possible leader who can rally anti-Taliban forces from Afghanistan that are currently scattered across several countries.Sayyaf, believed to be in his mid-70s, has been mooted as someone who can bring together the diverse groups because of his standing as both a scholar and a senior Pashtun leader, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.He has been based in New Delhi following the fall of the Ashraf Ghani government and the takeover of Kabul by the Taliban in mid-August. Sayyaf’s name was pushed forward as Ahmad Massoud, the son of legendary commander Ahmad Shah Massoud and founder of the National Resistance Front of Afghanistan, has had little success in uniting different groups, the people said.Massoud and Amruallah Saleh, the former Afghan spy chief and vice president, were seen as potential heads of the resistance forces but their stock has taken a beating since the fall of the Panjshir Valley to the Taliban in September. Massoud is currently believed to be operating from Paris and Dushanbe, while Saleh was reportedly based in the Tajikistan capital as recently as October.“Ahmad Massoud does not have the same amount of experience as a commander as his father. Saleh, on the other hand, is a good tactician but does not have a popular base,” said one of the people cited above.“If they had worked closely together, they might have been able to put together an effective resistance,” the person added.Though Saleh has claimed the powers of the Afghan president and declared himself the head of a government in exile, the people said he does not have a mass following.Ustad Sayyaf, as the former mujahideen commander is popularly known, is respected by Islamic scholars and within Pashtun circles, the people noted. It was not immediately clear whether Sayyaf had himself agreed to take on a larger role to bring together the different groups opposed to the Taliban.A large number of Afghan politicians have taken refuge in Turkey, while a sizeable number is based in the Iranian capital of Tehran. Some of the anti-Taliban groups are also scattered across Central Asia, especially Tajikistan.Sayyaf was once linked to al-Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden and the militants who took control of Kabul after the collapse of the communist government in the early 1990s. As a former leader of the Northern Alliance, he has been in contact with Indian diplomats and security officials over the years.Sayyaf last played a prominent role in Afghan politics in 2019, when Ghani chose him to chair a four-day loya jirga or grand council for peace efforts with the Taliban. Sayyaf has also been very critical of the Taliban.These developments come at a time when there are also divisions within Taliban ranks, especially between the hardliners from the Haqqani Network and members of the political office based in Doha. Some of the leaders from the Doha office, including deputy prime minister Abdul Ghani Baradar and deputy foreign minister Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai, have favoured a more moderate approach.“The Taliban are grappling with several problems, including lack of internal cohesion, poor governance, an impending economic collapse and a spike in attacks by the Islamic State,” said a second person.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indiabased-ustad-sayyaf-being-seen-as-leader-of-anti-taliban-forces-101637585328062.html
23-11-2021||World||Austria begins national lockdown to fight surge in Covid-19 cases||Austria went into a nationwide lockdown early Monday to combat soaring coronavirus infections, a step being closely watched by other European governments struggling with national outbreaks that are straining health care systems.The measures are expected to last for a maximum of 20 days but will be reevaluated after 10. They require people to stay home apart from basic reasons like getting groceries, going to the doctor and exercising. Restaurants and most shops must close and larger events will be canceled. Schools and day care centers can remain open, but parents are encouraged to keep their children home.Austria hopes to lift the measures on Dec. 13 but may keep a further lockdown on the unvaccinated.The new lockdown measures kicked in a day after many Austrians hurriedly enjoyed a last day out at coffeehouses and Christmas markets across the country.Christmas markets across central Vienna were packed Sunday with people eager to buy gifts and enjoy one last round of warm drinks and food. At the Freyung Christmas market in Vienna, Alexandra Ljesevic and her sister Anna sipped mulled wine and punch amid wooden stands and under sparkling holiday lights.“It's the last chance to feel the Christmas time and vibes,” Alexandra Ljesevic said.The sisters said they feel luckier than most, since their jobs won't be affected by the lockdown. But they're not optimistic that things will reopen as quickly as authorities hope.“It would be weird if in 20 days they said, Okay, for vaccinated people, you're free to go,' if the hospitals are still overwhelmed,” said Anna Ljesevic. “That's the only reason why we even need the lockdown.”Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg also announced Friday that Austria will also introduce a vaccine mandate as of Feb. 1. The details of how the mandate will work aren't yet clear.In an interview Sunday in the Kurier newspaper, Schallenberg said it's “sad” that the Austrian government had to resort to a mandate in order to ensure that enough people get vaccinated. Just under 66% of Austria's 8.9 million people are fully vaccinated, one of the lowest rates in Western Europe.On Saturday, Austria reported 15,297 new infections, after a week in which daily cases topped 10,000. Hospitals, especially those in the hardest hit regions of Salzburg and Upper Austria, are overwhelmed as the number of coronavirus patients rises in intensive care units.Schallenberg said he and other officials had hoped this summer that a new lockdown would not be necessary and it was a tough decision to impose one that affected vaccinated people.“That people's freedoms need to be restricted again is, believe me, also difficult for me to bear,” he said.The new measures, especially the vaccine mandate, have been met with fierce opposition among some Austrians and vaccine skeptics. A Saturday protest in the capital of Vienna drew 40,000 people, according to police, including members of far-right parties and groups.Interior Minister Karl Nehammer said Sunday that the country's anti-coronavirus protest scene is radicalizing.An “extremely diverse group of people” took part in the anti-vaccination protests, Nehammer said, according to the Austrian Press Agency, adding that included concerned citizens but also right-wing extremists and neo-Nazis.The lockdown is strictest measure Austrian officials have introduced to combat a fourth surge of infections and deaths. Earlier this month, the government first tried to pressure unvaccinated people to get the jab, barring them from restaurants, hotels and large events. Then officials implemented lockdown measures just for unvaccinated people.Nehammer said Sunday that police performed 150,000 checks in just one week to see if people outside of their homes were complying with the new rules, according to APA.At the Christmas market Sunday on Vienna's iconic Rathausplatz square, Rene Schlosser and Silvia Weidenauer sipped mulled wine from heart-shaped red mugs. They came for the day from their home in Austria's Waldviertel region to get a glimpse of the markets before everything shut down.“You have to accept it,” Weidenauer said of the lockdown. “There's no other option. All you can do is hope that these days when everything is closed actually have an effect.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/austria-begins-national-lockdown-to-fight-surge-in-covid-19-cases-101637545715606.html
