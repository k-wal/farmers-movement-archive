Biden went on to say that the legislation includes the most signifiant investment in roads and bridges in 70 years and in passenger rails in 50 years. The $1.2 trillion bill — $550 billion of which is new spending — will be signed by Biden “soon” at a ceremony to be attended by those who were critical to its writing and passage, such as Democratic Senator Krysten Sinema and Republican Senator Rob Portman.The infrastructure bill passed in a 228-206 vote in the Democratic-led House of Representatives late on Friday night, with the support of 10 Republicans. Though proposed by Biden,the measure had passed in the Senate in August with bipartisan support. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell had supported it in the upper chamber to the consternation of former president Donald Trump, who expressed criticisms publicly . But the bill had been delayed in the House of Representatives after progressive Democrats withheld their backing in an effort to bargain for another legislative measure by Biden, the Build Back Better bill, which proposes $1.7 trillion on expanding social safety and security — such as healthcare and paid maternity leave — and climate change.The need for an overhaul of the country’s infrastructure had long been on the agenda of many former US presidents, including Barack Obama and Trump. In fact, “infrastructure week” had become something of a running joke under Trump as the administration never ever presented a plan despite the then president’s repeated promises.The infrastructure bill passed in the aftermath of a stinging defeat suffered by Democrats in elections in Virginia last week, when Republicans won the top three statewide posts including the governor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-hails-passage-of-infrastructure-bill-as-monumental-step-forward-101636220366859.html

They had been collecting funds and unlawfully financing the proscribed organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). It had also ordered the confiscation of assets made from funds collected through terrorism financing.“On Saturday LHC’s division bench comprising Chief Justice Muhammad Ameer Bhatti and Justice Tariq Saleem Sheikh set aside the trial court’s decision in the CTD’s FIR 18 of 2020 against the six JuD leaders after the prosecution failed to prove the charge against the appellants beyond reasonable doubt,” a court official told PTI.The official said the division bench allowed the petition of the JuD leaders, observing “the statement of the ‘star prosecution witness’ is not reliable as there is no corroboratory evidence.”The counsel of the JuD leaders told the LHC that the Al-Anfaal Trust, of which the petitioners were members, has no “nexus with the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).”The law officer argued that the trust in question was working as a “proxy for the LeT” and the appellants were office-bearers of the trust.The JuD leaders were produced before the LHC amid strict security arrangements. They had been convicted in other terror financing cases and languishing at the Kot Lakhpat jail in Lahore.LeT founder Saeed has also been convicted in dozens of FIRs registered by the CTD on charges of terror financing. The CTD had registered as many as 41 FIRs against the leaders of the JuD in different cities. The trial courts have so far decided 37 of them.The ATC has sentenced Saeed to collective imprisonment of 36 years on terror finance charges under Anti-Terrorism Act 1997 in five cases so far. Saeed’s jail terms will run concurrently meaning he will not stay in jail for many years.He is serving his term in Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat jail along with other convicted JuD leaders. He was arrested in July, 2019.The US named Saeed as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist, and the US, since 2012, has offered a USD 10-million reward for information that brings Saeed to justice. He was listed as a terrorist under the UN Security Council Resolution in 2008.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-court-acquits-6-leaders-of-mumbai-attack-mastermind-hafiz-saeed-s-jud-101636218383774.html

The incident, in which the movement of cars behind it was blocked for close to three hours, drew major criticism from several people on the internet.A shopper named Henry took it to popular social media site Reddit, to complain of the incident and some Redditors commenting under the post said that it was the Tesla owner’s fault, while some others blamed the mall administration.“Perfect, a Tesla ran out of battery and stopped at the ramp of a 5 storey car park at Westfield. It has been three hours and counting,” the original poster (u/henrylondon1988) wrote. Along with the post, the user also shared a picture of the car in which the battery had drained and the several other cars queueing behind it.“I know range anxiety is a thing, but there is no excuse for this,” one user commented. “Considering the huge range these cars have, there’s really no excuse for this,” said another. “Westfield even has a large capacity Tesla charging station,” one user pointed out.Meanwhile, one user questioned the management over the incident and wrote, “3 hours and the Westfield management couldn't find a means to tow it off the ramp? Its in their interest to keep traffic flowing.” However, the original poster later said that the car was completely dead and the cars behind it had to reverse their way out of the ramp. “The Tesla is completely dead and it is in parking mode. The management team rumbling about their solution and basically there is nothing they can do. At the end, all the car reversed out from a 5 story winding ramp. Fab day,” Henry later said in one of the comments.According to a news report in the Daily Star, the car was identified as a Tesla Model S. “Westfield London’s car park team assisted the broken down vehicle and guided 10 vehicles that were behind the Tesla around it,” the Daily Star quoted a spokesperson for Westfield as saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-excuse-say-irate-shoppers-as-tesla-car-runs-out-of-battery-blocks-car-park-in-london-mall-for-3-hours-101636204118565.html

The Afghan Taliban have facilitated two rounds of preliminary talks between TTP and the Pakistan government, and Haqqani Network chief Sirajuddin Haqqani, who is said to be close to Islamabad, was helping the talks, reported Reuters quoting people familiar with the development.Last month, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said that his government was in talks with the TTP as part of a "reconciliation process".Pakistan has banned the terror organisation which has carried several attacks in the country since its formation in 2007. TTP leadership, composed largely of ethnic Pashtun militants, fled to the border areas of eastern Afghanistan after the Pakistan military intensified its operation in 2014. With suspected links to Al Qaeda, Pakistan Taliban seek to establish their harsh interpretation of Sharia law in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.The US state department has also designated the group as a foreign terrorist organisation (FTO).TTP commanders have termed the demand of releasing prisoners as confidence building-measure to gauge the sincerity of negotiations."We aren't too hopeful of the immediate results of the talks but our leaders had demanded the release of prisoners if they are sincere in meaningful negotiations," Reuters quoted TTP commander from Afghanistan's Kunar province as saying.The report suggests that the two sides have agreed to not issue any statement supporting or opposing the peace process until the accord is signed.On one hand, Pakistan has long been accused of supporting the Afghan Taliban financially, militarily and by providing intelligence inputs in their fight against the Western-back Afghan government which was ousted in August. On the other, it is also wary of the threat posed by the TTP in Pakistan which has a similar motive of establishing an exclusivist set-up of Sunni Pashtuns in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.TTP terrorists have killed and wounded thousands of civilians and personnel of Pakistani security forces but the group was weakened after the Pakistan military's Zarb-e-Azb operation in 2014, reported Reuters.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-taliban-demand-prisoner-release-as-ground-for-talks-with-islamabad-report-101636203980660.html

This is the first visit of a minister from the interim government in Afghanistan after the terrorist group took over the reins of the government in Afghanistan. The news agency also said that Pakistan and Afghanistan are in constant touch to finalise details of the visit.Muttaqi is a senior Taliban leader who was part of the Doha talks last year where the withdrawal of American troops was discussed. People familiar with the developments told the news agency that his visit is part of the ongoing engagements by Pakistan with the Kabul administration.Pakistan, however, clarified that the visit should not be seen as an act of formal recognition of the Taliban-led government in Afghanistan.The news of Muttaqi’s visit comes a week after Pakistan allowed diplomats appointed by the Taliban-led government to take charge of the Afghan embassy and consulates in Pakistan. Though the Imran Khan-led government does not recognise the Taliban-led government in Afghanistan, it continues to maintain diplomatic contact with the nation. Sardar Muhammad Shokaib was appointed as the charge d’affaires in Islamabad by the interim Taliban government.Pakistan in the international forum is vocal regarding constant communication between the Taliban and the international community. On several occasions and global forums, the nation requested the world leaders to maintain relations with Afghanistan. It also recently said that it shares similar concerns like the international community which feels that the Taliban will not allow an inclusive government, protect women’s rights and not allow the Afghan soil to become a haven for terrorism in the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-to-host-taliban-appointed-minister-to-reset-ties-between-neighbours-101636203206629.html

About 59 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been delivered already, covering 88% of those eligible, and about 78% of the total population.The positive aspect of the data revealed that kids rarely fell ill seriously and incidents of death among them were even rarer.Health Canada is currently reviewing a Pfizer vaccine for children under 12, and Tam said it was “working extremely hard to prioritise” the process and an announcement [on its approval for emergency use] could be expected within weeks.Also Read: India asks Canada to list separatist outfit Sikhs for Justice as terrorist entityThat paediatric vaccine for the age group 5 to 11, if approved, will be delivered in smaller doses than those for the rest of the population.The new data was provided as the fourth wave of the pandemic wanes in Canada. The seven-day average for daily infections is at 2,231, which is 5% cent lower than the preceding corresponding period. So far, there have been 1,725,570 Covid-19 cases and 29,095 related deaths in the country, as per latest WHO (World Health Organization) data.Tam said the latest figures suggest “the fourth wave could continue to decline in the coming weeks if transmission does not increase.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/highest-percentage-of-fresh-covid-19-infections-among-children-in-canada-101636190544149.html

Further investigations are under way and the case has been referred to court," he said.Khosti did not identify the victims, but a source in Mazar-i-Sharif told AFP that at least one of the dead was a women's rights activist, whose family does not wish to speak to the media.A report on BBC Persian, citing civil society sources, said the four women were friends and colleagues who had hoped to travel to Mazar-i-Sharif airport for a flight out of the country.A rights group source told AFP on condition of anonymity that the women received a call that they thought was an invitation to join an evacuation flight and were picked up by a car, only to be found dead later.The Taliban, who seized power in Afghanistan in August after a 20-year war against the former US-backed government, are a deeply conservative Islamist movement.Under their last period of rule women were banned from public life and since the group's return to government many rights activists have fled the country.Some women who remained have held street protests in Kabul demanding that their rights be respected and that girls be allowed to attend public high schools.Taliban fighters have broken up some of the protests, and the government has threatened to arrest any journalists covering unauthorised gatherings.But the movement's leaders have insisted that their fighters are not authorised to kill activists and have promised that any who do will be punished.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/4-women-killed-in-afghanistan-s-mazar-i-sharif-taliban-confirm-reports-101636188593136.html

Notably, the development comes even as other commodities like petrol, diesel, and sugar in Pakistan continued to become more expensive for the citizens. It forced the Imran Khan-led government on Wednesday to announce the “country's biggest-ever” subsidy package worth ₹120 billion, a move deemed desperate by opposition leaders.How expensive is electricity in Pakistan?According to Geo News, Nepra has increased the price per unit of electricity by ₹1.68 for domestic consumers under the basic tariff, while for commercial and other categories, the price per unit of electricity will be ₹1.39.The new rates have come into effect from November 1. However, some relief can be found in the fact that those consumers who use only up to 200 units of electricity a month will not be affected by the new rates. According to the report, the government expects a profit of ₹135 billion per annum after the recent hike in power prices.This comes after the latest surge in petroleum prices. According to a finance ministry notification, with the ₹8.03 increase, the new price of petrol has been fixed at ₹145.82 per litre, which has come into effect from November 5.Imran Khan criticised over subsidy announcementOn Wednesday, Imran Khan announced "country's biggest-ever" subsidy package worth ₹120 billion, providing the 30 per cent discount on ghee, flour, and pulses to support 130 million people by ebbing away from the impact of inflation. Shortly after Khan's announcement opposition leaders had criticised the move and had called it an “acceptance of the government's failure” and “nothing but a joke”, said the Pakistani publication.Taking to Twitter, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had said that the PM's package is “too little for 200 million people.” Following suit, former senator and PPP leader Sherry Rehman had termed PM Imran Khan's address to the nation a “bizarre speech”, and called the premier the “Blame Minister of Pakistan”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-petrol-and-sugar-electricity-rates-hiked-in-inflation-hit-pakistan-101636179051980.html
06-11-2021||World||Nasa, USGS collect first Landsat 9 light images of Earth. Check here||A joint mission between Nasa and the US Geological Survey (USGS), Landsat 9, which was launched on September 27, 2021, has collected its first light images of Earth.According to a press release by Nasa, all the images, acquired on October 31 provide a preview of how the mission will help people manage vital natural resources and understand the impacts of climate change, adding to Landsat's unparalleled data record that spans nearly 50 years of space-based Earth observation.“Landsat 9's first images capture critical observations about our changing planet and will advance this joint mission of Nasa and the US Geological Survey that provides critical data about Earth's landscapes and coastlines seen from space. This program has the proven power to not only improve lives but also save lives. Nasa will continue to work with USGS to strengthen and improve accessibility to Landsat data so decision-makers in America - and around the world - better understand the devastation of the climate crisis, manage agricultural practices, preserve precious resources and respond more effectively to natural disasters,” said Nasa administrator Bill Nelson.These first light images show Detroit, Michigan, with neighbouring Lake St. Clair, the intersection of cities and beaches along a changing Florida coastline, and images from Navajo Country in Arizona that will add to the wealth of data helping us monitor crop health and manage irrigation water. The new images also provided data about the changing landscapes of the Himalayas in High Mountain Asia and the coastal islands and shorelines of Northern Australia, said the press release.Landsat 9 is similar in design to its predecessor, Landsat 8, which was launched in 2013 and remains in orbit, but features several improvements. The new satellite transmits data with higher radiometric resolution back down to Earth, allowing it to detect more subtle differences, especially over darker areas like water or dense forests. For example, Landsat 9 can differentiate more than 16,000 shades of a given wavelength color; Landsat 7, the satellite being replaced, detects only 256 shades. This increased sensitivity will allow Landsat users to see much more subtle changes than ever before."First light is a big milestone for Landsat users - it's the first chance to really see the kind of quality that Landsat 9 provides. And they look fantastic. When we have Landsat 9 operating in coordination with Landsat 8, it's going to be this wealth of data, allowing us to monitor changes to our home planet every eight days," said Jeff Masek Nasa's Landsat 9 project scientist at Goddard Space Flight Center.The release informed that Landsat 9 carries two instruments that capture imagery: the Operational Land Imager 2 (OLI-2), which detects visible, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared light in nine wavelengths, and the Thermal Infrared Sensor 2 (TIRS-2), which detects thermal radiation in two wavelengths to measure Earth's surface temperatures and its changes. These instruments will provide Landsat 9 users with essential information about crop health, irrigation use, water quality, wildfire severity, deforestation, glacial retreat, urban expansion, and more."The data and images from Landsat 9 are expanding our capability to see how Earth has changed over decades. In a changing climate, continuous and free access to Landsat data, and the other data in Nasa's Earth-observing fleet, help data users, including city planners, farmers, and scientists, plan for the future," said Karen St. Germain, Earth Science Division director at Nasa headquarters in Washington.Nasa's Landsat 9 team is conducting a 100-day check-out period that involves testing the satellite's systems and subsystems and calibrating its instruments in preparation for handing the mission over to USGS in January. USGS will operate Landsat 9 along with Landsat 8, and together the two satellites will collect approximately 1,500 images of Earth's surface every day, covering the globe every eight days, according to the release."The incredible first pictures from the Landsat 9 satellite are a glimpse into the data that will help us make science-based decisions on key issues including water use, wildfire impacts, coral reef degradation, glacier and ice-shelf retreat, and tropical deforestation. This historic moment is the culmination of our long partnership with Nasa on Landsat 9's development, launch, and initial operations, which will better support environmental sustainability, climate change resiliency, and economic growth - all while expanding an unparalleled record of Earth's changing landscapes," said USGS acting director Dr David Applegate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasa-usgs-collect-first-landsat-9-light-images-of-earth-check-here-101636177778435.html
06-11-2021||World||India asks Canada to list separatist outfit Sikhs for Justice as terrorist entity||India’s National Investigation Agency (NIA) has formally requested Canada to declare the organisation Sikhs for Justice a terrorist entity. NIA interacted with their Canadian law enforcement counterparts this week in Ottawa and gave them information and dossiers to back their case against the front.Hindustan Times has learnt that the request was made earlier this year and the NIA team’s Ottawa visit was meant to substantiate India’s claim that SFJ was fuelling violence in India, particularly in Punjab, as part of its separatist agenda which includes spearheading the Punjab Referendum. SFJ, through its legal counsel Gurpatwant Pannun, has consistently denied any support to violence while pursuing its cause for a separate Khalistan.The NIA team was in Ottawa on Thursday and Friday at the invitation of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police or RCMP and it also “held additional meetings with the International Crime and Counter-terrorism Bureau of Global Affairs Canada and with senior officials from the International Affairs Division of Public Safety Canada, with a view to deepening and expanding India-Canada collaboration on counter-terrorism and interdiction of global terrorist financing,” according to a release issued by India’s High Commission in Ottawa. It is also believed to have met officials of Canada’s Department of Justice.The visit, the release said, was “for better coordinating investigation against entities and individuals suspected of terrorism and to discuss other criminal matters”. The NIA team was led by an inspector general of police and it “held detailed discussions with senior RCMP officials to collate evidence on several ongoing investigations into cases of terrorism and other serious crimes in order to bring about successful prosecution of the accused in both India and Canada.”India’s high commissioner to Ottawa, Ajay Bisaria welcomed the visit and tweeted that the “India-Canada strategic partnership also leads to robust cooperation in investigating crime and terrorism.”A senior Indian official speaking on condition of anonymity said that the Canadian law enforcement was “very responsive” to India’s concerns during the “comprehensive” discussions and a “few other entities” also figured in the talks.Also Read: Canada’s Trudeau extends greetings on Diwali, Bandi Chhor DivasResponding to queries in this regard from the Hindustan Times last week, a spokesperson for Public Safety Canada, the department tasked with such listing, said the government “does not disclose what entities are being considered for listing. The assessment process for listing entities that support or engage in terrorism is on-going and entities are prioritised for listing based on a number of factors, including Canada’s national security interests.”He added that in order to be listed, the entity must meet the test of either having “knowingly carried out, attempted to carry out, participated in or facilitated a terrorist activity”, or “knowingly acted on behalf of, at the direction of or in association with such an entity.”While SFJ is headquartered in New York, it remains influential among pro-Khalistan elements in Canada. India banned SFJ last year under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.Public Safety Canada’s currently listed entities includes two Khalistani outfits – Babbar Khalsa International and International Sikh Youth Federation, other than groups like the Taliban, Al Qaida and others such as Boko Haram, Haqqani Network, Hizbul Mujahideen, Indian Mujahideen, Islamic State and its offshoots, Jaish-e-Moahammed, Lashkar-e-Taiba, among several others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-asks-canada-to-list-separatist-outfit-sikhs-for-justice-as-terrorist-entity-101636178062812.html
06-11-2021||World||China's Communist Party to meet next week, further cement Xi's grip on power||Chinese President Xi Jinping, the uncontested leader of the world's most populous nation, heads a pivotal plenary of the ruling party's top figures next week that will set the tone for his bid for a long-term rule.From Monday to Thursday, some 400 members of the Communist Party's all-powerful Central Committee gather in Beijing behind closed doors.The only such meeting this year paves the way to its 20th party congress next autumn -- at which Xi is widely expected to be handed a third term in office, cementing his position as China's most powerful leader since Mao Zedong.At next week's plenary, top figures will debate a key resolution celebrating the party's main achievements in its 100 years of existence, according to state news agency Xinhua.Analysts say the resolution, only the third of its kind in the party's history, will help Xi shore up his grip on power by setting in stone his vision for China, ahead of the crucial 2022 party congress.Like all meetings of Beijing's secretive top leadership, the event will be held behind closed doors, and most key decisions are made well in advance.China's political meetings are all highly choreographed and open dissent to the official line is extremely rare.‘Natural inheritor’The content has not yet been published in full but the timing of the resolution is key – as was the case with the previous two resolutions.The first, passed under Mao in 1945, helped him cement his authority over the Communist Party four years before it seized power.The second, adopted under Deng Xiaoping in 1981, saw the regime adopt economic reforms and recognise the "mistakes" of Mao's ways.Unlike the previous two, Xi's resolution will not mark a break with the past, Harvard University's Anthony Saich told AFP.“Rather, it is intended to show that Xi is the natural inheritor of a process since the founding of the party that qualifies him to lead in the ‘new era’,” said Saich, an expert on Chinese politics.“The purpose is to consolidate Xi as the natural inheritor of the ‘glorious history’ of the CCP,” he added, referring to the Chinese Communist Party.Saich also said the resolution is likely to mark a step back from Deng's text in that it will be less critical of the Mao era from 1949 to 1976.Under Mao's grip, tens of millions of people starved as the regime sought to force the country into communes.In the decade leading up to his death, he unleashed the Cultural Revolution, an era of violence that scarred the national psyche.Under Deng, the party saw a bid to evade a repeat of Mao's personality cult – if only to ensure continuity of its rule.‘Uncontested’According to dissident political scholar Wu Qiang, who lost his job as a lecturer at Tsinghua University in Beijing over his research, the resolution's approval would mean "that Xi Jinping's authority is uncontested".Wu also believes the plenum will firm China's path back towards a more "controlled, planned" economy -- as seen in Xi's ongoing drive to regulate the country's mammoth enterprises in sectors from tech to real estate.The question of the democratic island of Taiwan -- which sees itself as sovereign but which Beijing claims as its own territory -- could also be on the meeting agenda.Regardless of next week's meeting, Xi's uncontested authority is not in question, according to Carl Minzner, a senior fellow for China studies at the Washington-based Council on Foreign Relations.“The core issue is: how much higher might he go?” he told AFP.“The tone and content of the resolution will likely give some suggestion as to how Xi seeks to be portrayed,” he said.“As the equal of Mao and Deng? Or merely Mao alone?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-communist-party-to-meet-next-week-further-cement-xi-s-grip-on-power-101636173081481.html
06-11-2021||World||In major win for Biden, US Congress passes historic infrastructure bill||The House on Friday passed the biggest US infrastructure package in decades, marking a victory for President Joe Biden and unleashing $550 billion of fresh spending on roads, bridges, public transit, and other projects in coming years.The vote was 228-206 and sends the legislation to Biden for his signature. Thirteen Republicans supported the bill and six Democrats voted against it, a sign of the intra-party strains that nearly derailed the legislation. It would not have passed without GOP votes.Passage capped a day in which Speaker Nancy Pelosi was forced to deal with a last-minute standoff between party progressives and moderates that took hours of intense negotiations and the president’s intervention to resolve.Pelosi and Biden, however, were unable to land a House vote at the same time on a more than $1.75 trillion tax and spending package that makes up much of the rest of Biden’s domestic agenda. The House instead approved a procedural measure teeing up a vote after lawmakers return from next week’s break and the Congressional Budget Office delivers a cost analysis. That was a last-minute concession to a small group of moderates who refused to vote for the spending package without the CBO score. Progressives also made a concession by supporting the infrastructure legislation before a vote on the larger spending package. “I’ve spoken to the president a number of times today and the president appreciates that we are working in good faith with our colleagues' agreement,” Representative Pramila Jayapal, head of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said. “We’re going to trust each other because the Democratic Party is together on this, we are united that it is important for us to get both bills done.”A statement from the group of moderates including Representatives Stephanie Murphy and Josh Gottheimer said they would commit to voting for the economic package “in its current form” as long as a Congressional Budget Office score is consistent with White House estimates on cost and revenue.The back-and-forth throughout the day and threats from both factions to scuttle any action left some lawmakers frustrated.“We started this day thinking we had a deal, thinking that we were going to cast our votes -- were excited to cast those votes,” Representative Jared Huffman, a progressive from California, said. “And then a small cohort of our colleagues moved the goalposts.”Still, not all of the progressives were ready to go for the deal. The six Democratic “no” votes all were part of a group of progressives often referred to as the squad: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Jamaal Bowman of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Cori Bush of Missouri, and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts.“I cannot in good conscience support the infrastructure bill without voting on the President’s transformative agenda first,” Omar said in a statement.The 13 Republican “yes” votes included Fred Upton of Michigan, Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, and John Katko of New York.With the vote in doubt for much of the day, Biden made calls to House Democrats and put off plans to leave Washington on Friday for his Delaware home. From the White House, he continued to lobby Democrats well into the night.The public-works bill totals more than $1.2 trillion when routine highway dollars are factored in. Biden has promoted it as a vital step to taking on the challenge of a rising China, and a test of Washington’s policy-making abilities in a time of sharp partisan divides.House Republicans argued that it didn’t focus enough on roads and that passing it would “unlock” the social spending bill, which they said would generate inflation.“The Senate infrastructure bill and the massive tax and spending spree are not the will of the American people. The Democrats’ radical agenda to spend a reckless amount of money will raise costs and make it even harder for people to build a better life,” Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a Washington State Republican, said during floor debate.Passage of H.R.3684 came after Democrats failed to meet two deadlines in September and October to act on the bill, despite personal appeals by the president.Success in breaking an impasse between Democratic moderates and progressives -- who had battled over the elements of the bigger social-spending and tax-increase bill and the timing of enacting the infrastructure one -- may provide a much-needed lift to Biden’s public standing. The president’s ratings have sagged in recent months, with the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, high inflation, and the delta variant surge.Some Democrats blamed losses in statewide elections in Virginia and a close call for the incumbent governor of New Jersey on Tuesday on the failure to enact their promised agenda.Progressives for months had effectively blocked the infrastructure bill, withholding their support -- needed for passage -- to gain leverage over party moderates in the fight over the bigger, Democrats-only bill.The so-called reconciliation bill, providing an expansion of spending on social programs and measures to address climate change along with higher taxes on companies and the wealthy, now totals more than $1.75 trillion, down from an earlier $3.5 trillion.Progressives had insisted on a deal – or even an actual vote – in the Senate on the reconciliation bill before they’d back the infrastructure legislation. With infrastructure passed, the risk is that liberals will no longer have sway over Senate moderates, who have raised doubts about Medicare, paid family leave, methane fees, nicotine taxes, and immigration measures in the other bill.“I think there’s a major concern,” Ocasio-Cortez said.House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said the legislation would be passed before the Nov. 25 Thanksgiving holiday. In their statement, moderates said they would allow for a vote no later than the week of Nov. 15. Yet that could delay final action into December, when Congress must grapple with a Dec. 3 government funding deadline and raising the debt ceiling, both of which will spark conflict with Republicans. The Senate is all but certain to change the legislation, meaning the House would have to vote again.The Senate had passed the $550 billion infrastructure plan on Aug. 10 on a bipartisan 69 to 30 vote. Nineteen Republicans, including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, joined with all 50 senators who caucus with Democrats to support the bill. Among the components of the eight-year public-projects bill:||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-major-win-for-biden-us-congress-passes-historic-infrastructure-bill-101636174532811.html

The US has been among the worst-affected countries and one of the top contributors in the daily infection tally.However, the data presented by Ocugen may not be enough for the FDA to grant the request, news agency AFP reported.The study was conducted in India from May to July this year to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of the vaccine in the 2-18 age group. Covaxin was evaluated in three age groups: 2-6 years, 6-12 years and 12-18 years and all participants were given two doses of the vaccine 28 days apart.In the clinical trial with 526 children, no serious adverse events or hospitalisations were observed.Pfizer's shot is the only one approved in the United States for children under the age of 18.Covaxin, developed in India by Bharat Biotech, gained emergency approval from the World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday and has already been cleared for use in 17 countries.It is one of the four vaccines being used in India in the nationwide inoculation programme. The other three vaccines are Covishield, Sputnik V and the one made by Zydus Cadilla.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covaxin-approval-requested-in-us-for-ages-2-18-by-bharat-biotech-s-partner-101636171384750.html

Mirza Ali Ahmadi and his wife Suraya found themselves and their five children on Aug. 19 in a chaotic crowd outside the gates of the Kabul airport in Afghanistan when a US soldier, from over the tall fence, asked if they needed help.Fearing their two-month-old baby Sohail would get crushed in the melee, they handed him to the soldier, thinking they would soon get to the entrance, which was only about 16 feet (5 meters) away.But at that moment, Mirza Ali said, the Taliban - which had swiftly taken over the country as US troops withdrew - began pushing back hundreds of hopeful evacuees. It took the rest of the family more than a half-hour to get to the other side of the airport fence.Once they were inside, Sohail was nowhere to be found.Mirza Ali, who said he worked as a security guard at the US embassy for 10 years, began desperately asking every official he encountered about his baby's whereabouts. He said a military commander told him the airport was too dangerous for a baby and that he might have been taken to a special area for children. But when they got there it was empty."He walked with me all around the airport to search everywhere," Mirza Ali said in an interview through a translator. He said he never got the commander's name, as he didn't speak English and was relying on Afghan colleagues from the embassy to help communicate. Three days went by."I spoke to maybe more than 20 people," he said. "Every officer - military or civilian - I came across I was asking about my baby."He said one of the civilian officials he spoke to told him Sohail might have been evacuated by himself. "They said 'we don't have resources to keep the baby here.'"Mirza Ali, 35, Suraya, 32, and their other children, 17, 9, 6, and 3 years old, were put on an evacuation flight to Qatar and then to Germany and eventually landed in the United States. The family is now at Fort Bliss in Texas with other Afghan refugees waiting to be resettled somewhere in the United States. They have no relatives here.Mirza Ali said he saw other families handing their babies over the Kabul airport fence to soldiers at the same time. One video clip of a small baby in a diaper being hoisted by her arm over razor wire went viral on social media. She was later reunited with her parents.Ever since his baby went missing dates are a blur, Mirza Ali said. Every person he comes across - aid workers, US officials - he tells them about Sohail. "Everyone promises they will do their best, but they are just promises," he said.An Afghan refugee support group created a “Missing Baby” sign with Sohail's picture on it and is circulating it among their networks in the hopes that someone will recognise him.A US government official familiar with the situation said the case had been flagged for all the agencies involved, including the US bases and overseas locations. The child was last seen being handed to a US soldier during the chaos at the Kabul airport but “unfortunately no one can find the child,” the official said.A Department of Defense spokesperson and a spokesperson for the US Department of Homeland Security, which is overseeing resettlement efforts, referred queries on the matter to the State Department, since the separation took place overseas.A State Department spokesperson said the government is working with international partners and the international community "to explore every avenue to locate the child, which includes an international amber alert that was issued through the International Center for Missing and Exploited Children."Suraya, who also spoke through a translator, said she cries most of the time and that her other children are distraught."All I am doing is thinking about my child," Suraya said. "Everyone that is calling me, my mother, my father, my sister, they all comfort me and say 'don't worry, God is kind, your son will be found.'"||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/baby-handed-to-us-soldiers-in-chaos-of-afghanistan-airlift-still-missing-101636168462008.html
06-11-2021||World||WHO raises alarm over fresh Covid surge in Europe: All you need to know||The World Health Organization (WHO) has sounded alarm over rising cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in Europe, with Hans Kluge, the world health body's regional director for the continent, expressing his ‘grave concern’ over the pace at which the infection is spreading across 53 countries of the region. “ Last week, Europe saw an increase of six per cent in fresh Covid-19 infections as compared to those during the previous week. Overall, during the past four weeks, it has seen a rise of more than 55 per cent in daily cases. It is, therefore, once again at the epicentre of the pandemic,” Kluge noted.The official further laid out two factors which, according to him, have led to a surge in new cases of the viral disease: ease in restrictions and low vaccination.Here are the latest updates on fresh Covid-19 surge in Europe:(1.) With more than 37,000 fresh infections on Friday, Germany saw a record single-day rise for second consecutive day, after 33,949 people tested positive on Thursday. According to the German government, the virus is quickly spreading among those yet to be vaccinated, and has thus requested people to take both doses.(2.) French President Emmanuel Macron will address the country on November 9, as the seven-day average of fresh infections has risen to 6200, as against less than 4200 in early October. On Wednesday, the French government made face masks compulsory for school children in 39 regional departments with high infection rates.(3.) On Friday, Italy saw an increase in its new cases from a day ago though the daily toll came down. There were 6764 new patients as against 5905 on Thursday. There were 51 related fatalities, down from 59 on November 4.(4.) Austria, which logged a near-record 9388 new cases on Friday, has announced that people yet to be fully vaccinated will be prohibited from entering cafes, restaurants and hair saloons. Also, the Austrian government expects a new record rise in cases in the coming days.(5.) Greece, too, has announced prohibitions for those not fully vaccinated. People need to get tested for Covid-19 twice a week. Also, a negative test report will be required to avail services from banks, shops and other establishments.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-raises-alarm-over-fresh-covid-surge-in-europe-all-you-need-to-know-101636165894157.html

Akhundzada has been the spiritual chief of the Islamist movement since 2016 but has remained a reclusive figure, even after his group seized power in Afghanistan in August.In a rare written public statement, Akhundzada has urged Taliban commanders to purge their ranks."All those elders of their groups must look inside their ranks and see if there is any unknown entity working against the will of the government, which must be eradicated as soon as possible," Akhundzada said in the statement tweeted out by multiple Taliban accounts."Whatever wrong happens, the elder will be responsible for the consequences of the actions in this world and in the afterlife," he further warned in the statement.The Taliban seized power in Afghanistan in August (completed their military campaign by capturing the presidential tower in Kabul on August 15) just days before American troops left the country as agreed in a peace deal.Since taking over, the Taliban have issued multiple diktats reminding of their old rule when the group ruled with iron fist and suppressed any voice of resistance.As the Taliban government formed, the group was forced to recruit former foes, allied Islamist militants and young madrassa students.Now that it is the government, the movement faces attacks in its turn from hardline factions like the Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K).The terror group claimed responsibility for an attak on a military hospital in Kabul last week in which 19 people were killed. Then there are instances where members of the Taliban have been blamed for killings, denting the group's promise of re-establishing "stability and security" in the war-torn country.In his statement, Akhundzada said Taliban unit commanders must take the time to sit down with their recruits to "try to work on their manners and behaviour so that these mujahideen can work better for his leader."Akhundzada maintains a low-profile and often gives spiritual message to the members of the group. Last month, there were rumours about his death in a clash between two factions of the Taliban. But, a few days later, Akhundzada made a public appearance in Kadahar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-message-to-taliban-commanders-akhundzada-warns-against-infiltrators-101636167078501.html

He will be sentenced by a federal district court judge.In a statement, FBI assistant director Alan Kohler Jr. said the bureau was working with dozens of US agencies to share information and resources to combat operations by the People's Republic of China.“For those who doubt the real goals of the PRC, this should be a wake-up call; they are stealing American technology to benefit their economy and military,” he said.Going back as far as 2013, Yanjun was accused of using multiple aliases to carry out economic espionage and steal trade secrets on behalf of China. Multiple US aviation and aerospace companies, including GE Aviation, a unit of General Electric Co, were his targets, the release said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-spy-convicted-for-plotting-to-steal-us-aerospace-secrets-101636160272508.html

But from Monday, they can book the appointment after five months.Currently, people can only book the appointment six months after their second dose."This will accelerate the booster programme, ensure the NHS is able to vaccinate people as quickly as possible, and importantly help more people maintain protection against COVID-19 as we know immunity will dip over time," Health Secretary Sajid Javid, who sets policy in England, said.The health ministry said that the winter would be challenging for the National Health Service (NHS), owing to increased spread of other seasonal viruses such as flu.Britain is currently reporting an average of 40,000 new cases each day. Even though vaccines have greatly reduced deaths from COVID, doctors are warning that pressures are building inside hospitals.Johnson has so far resisted calls for a "Plan B" involving mask mandates, vaccine passes and work-from-home directives, and Javid has said that while the NHS faces "huge" pressure, it is not currently unsustainable pressure."COVID-19 vaccines are the best way to protect yourself and your family ahead of a challenging winter and this change to the booking system will make it as easy as possible for people to book their booster jabs," Javid said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-allows-early-booking-of-booster-shots-to-ramp-up-vaccine-rollout-101636156972252.html

The child was last seen being handed to a U.S. soldier during the chaos at the Kabul airport but "unfortunately no one can find the child," the official said.A Department of Defense spokesperson and a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which is overseeing resettlement efforts, referred queries on the matter to the State Department, since the separation took place overseas.A State Department spokesperson said the government is working with international partners and the international community "to explore every avenue to locate the child, which includes an international amber alert that was issued through the International Center for Missing and Exploited Children."Suraya, who also spoke through a translator, said she cries most of the time and that her other children are distraught."All I am doing is thinking about my child," Suraya said. "Everyone that is calling me, my mother, my father, my sister, they all comfort me and say 'don't worry, God is kind, your son will be found.'"||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-baby-handed-to-us-soldiers-amid-chaos-at-kabul-airport-still-missing-101636146198453.html
06-11-2021||World||US announces ‘Havana Syndrome’ probe||US secretary of state Antony Blinken appointed a long-time diplomat to lead the investigation into dozens of cases of “Havana Syndrome”, as the Biden administration struggles to get to the bottom of an illness that’s been called either an attack by a foreign adversary or a mass psychological event.Announcing the appointment of Jonathan Moore on Friday, Blinken urged people to come forward with cases and pledged new efforts to uncover the illness’s origins.Yet he also continued calling the reports “anomalous health incidents” rather than attacks, a reflection of how the administration isn’t yet aligned with members of Congress and some victims who insist they were targeted by some sort of auditory weapon.“These incidents have left our colleagues with profound harm,” Blinken said.The syndrome, first identified in Cuba, has affected US diplomats, intelligence officials and other government employees on overseas trips. Victims often describe a range of unusual physical sensations after hearing strange sounds.A flight carrying Vice-President Kamala Harris to Vietnam from Singapore in August was delayed by a few hours due to concerns about one such incident.$10mn reward to catch DarkSide hackersThe United States government on Thursday announced a $10mn reward for help finding leaders of the high-profile ransomware gang DarkSide, authorities’ latest try at combating spiking cyber-extortion attacks.Washington blamed the Russia-based group for the online assault that forced the shutdown of the largest oil pipeline in the eastern US in May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-announces-havana-syndrome-probe-101636142629991.html

Waiting the same period after the second shot raises that to 92%. For those that have had Covid-19 and followed the two-dose regimen, there is a 98% drop in the risk of hospital admission.Russia on Friday reported nearly 1,200 deaths from Covid-19 over the past day, just short of its record in a persistent wave of coronavirus infections that closed most businesses in the country this week.The national coronavirus task force said 1,192 people died in the past 24 hours and 40,735 new infection cases were tallied.Officials blame the low vaccination rate as a major factor in the sharp rise in cases that began in mid-September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-vaccine-effective-against-delta-in-s-africa-101636142012434.html

06-11-2021||World||CO2 emissions to rebound in 2022||Global CO2 emissions are set to rebound to pre-pandemic levels next year, according to an assessment published on Thursday as countries signed up to fossil-fuel cutting pledges criticised as too vague by campaigners.The grim emissions assessment was billed as a “reality check” for nations gathered at the COP26 summit in Glasgow, seen as a last chance to halt catastrophic climate crisis.Moderate progress this week was checked by the release of the Global Carbon Project’s annual report, which showed that emissions from gas and coal will rise in 2021 by more than they dropped during the pandemic.It suggested CO2 emissions could eclipse the 40-billion-tonne record set in 2019, which some have predicted - and many hoped - would be a peak.China alone will account for 31% of global emissions this year as it seeks to power its economy past Covid-19, the report said.“This report is a reality check,” co-author Corinne Le Quere, a professor of climate change science at Britain’s University of East Anglia, told AFP.“It shows what’s happening in the real world while we are here in Glasgow talking about tackling climate change.”The report came as two pledges from nations and finance institutions opened a path to accelerated movement away from dirty energy.Twenty countries, including major funders the US and Canada, vowed to “end new direct public support for the international unabated fossil fuel energy sector by the end of 2022”.Unabated fossil fuel projects are those that do not deploy technology to absorb the carbon pollution they produce.China, South Korea and Japan - all major overseas fossil fuel funders - did not sign on, even though these countries have separately made similar pledges.While ending international funding is seen as a boost to the COP26 summit and key to keeping the Paris Agreement goal of limiting temperature rises to 1.5 degrees Celsius compared with pre-industrial levels, even more crucial is quickly drawing down domestic use of coal, by far the dirtiest fossil fuel.Host Britain announced that more than 40 countries had signed up to a commitment to phase out coal use within their borders within decades.Among the signatories were South Korea, Indonesia and Poland - all among the top 10 globally in terms of coal-fired power capacity. COP26 organisers say that 23 countries had promised for the first time to end their coal use, though several of these nations, including Poland, do in fact have pre-standing phase-out commitments.Smog engulfs BeijingHighways and school playgrounds in Beijing were closed on Friday due to heavy pollution, as China ramps up coal production and faces scrutiny of its environmental record at make-or-break international climate talks.A thick haze of smog blanketed swathes of northern China on Friday, with visibility in some areas reduced to less than 200 metres (yards), according to the country’s weather forecaster.Schools in the capital - which will host the Winter Olympics in February - were ordered to stop physical education classes and outdoor activities.Stretches of highways to major cities including Shanghai, Tianjin and Harbin were closed due to poor visibility.Pollutants detected by a monitoring station at the US embassy in Beijing reached levels defined as “very unhealthy” for the general population.Thunberg brands UN climate summit ‘a failure’Swedish campaigner Greta Thunberg on Friday branded the UN climate summit in Glasgow a “failure” after a week of negotiations produced what some experts have called vague promises to cut emissions.“It is not a secret that COP26 is a failure,” Thunberg told thousands of youth protesters at a march in the Scottish city.She called the COP26 talks “a two-week long celebration of business as usual and ‘blah, blah, blah’”. “This is no longer a climate conference. This is now a global greenwashing festival,” Thunberg told cheering crowds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/co2-emissions-to-rebound-in-2022-101636139418548.html
06-11-2021||World||New Zealand PM says trade won't trump China's human rights record||New Zealand will not shy away from criticising China's human rights record to protect its lucrative trade relationship with Beijing, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has said in an interview.Ardern's government is accused of going easy on China's much-questioned humanitarian record, prompting some commentators to label Wellington a "weak link" in the US-led Five Eyes security alliance.But the New Zealand leader rejected suggestions that economic ties with her country's largest trading partner were muting her ability to voice broader concerns."It is very important to us that we maintain integrity in the way that we conduct our diplomatic relationships," she said in a joint interview with AFP, the New Zealand Herald, NBC News and Covering Climate Now.Ardern noted "heightened tensions" between China and Australia, which has been hit with punitive sanctions by Beijing over its outspoken stance on issues such as the treatment of Uyghurs and the erosion of democracy in Hong Kong.New Zealand has also raised concerns about the same issues, but has been more restrained in its statements and has not faced any economic retaliation.Ardern's government declined to support a parliamentary motion in May labelling the treatment of Uyghurs as genocide, saying the legal case to use the term had not been made and instead expressed "grave concern".New Zealand has also said it is "uncomfortable" using the Five Eyes group -- comprising the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand -- to criticise China on rights issues.But Ardern insisted New Zealand's diplomatic ties with China were not determined by trade."We have the maturity in our relationship to raise issues that we're concerned about, be it human rights issues, be it labour issues, be it environmental issues," she said."And it's very important to us that we continue to be able to do that and do that regardless of those trading ties."Asked if she would classify China as an ally or an adversary, she replied: "I don't think we would determine our relationship with any country in such stark terms."Ardern said earlier this year that New Zealand's differences with China on human rights were becoming "harder to reconcile", but her government would continue to point out areas of concern to Beijing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-pm-says-trade-won-t-trump-china-s-human-rights-record-101636136350814.html
