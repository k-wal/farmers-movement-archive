He will continue to serve on the board of Twitter until his term expires in 2022 to help with the transition, before moving on.“I’ve decided to leave Twitter because I believe the company is ready to move on from its founders,” Dorsey said in a statement.Agrawal is a computer engineer from IIT Bombay and has been with Twitter for the past 10 years, the last four of which were as the company’s chief technology officer. He started at the company as an engineer in 2011 after stints at AT&T, Microsoft and Yahoo, according to his LinkedIn profile.Dorsey cited Agarwal’s appointment by the board as one of the reasons for stepping down.“The board ran a rigorous process considering all options and unanimously appointed Parag,” Dorsey wrote, adding, “He has been my choice for some time given how deeply he understands the company and its needs. He is curious, probing, rational, creative, demanding, self-aware and humble. My trust in him as our CEO is bone deep.”Agrawal becomes the newest entrant to the gallery of Indian Americans heading major US tech companies. He joins Google’s Sunder Pichai, Microsoft’s Satya Nadella and Adobe’s Shantanu Narayen.  Referring to his decision to not stay on the board or become chair, he said he believes it’s really important to give Agarwal the “space he needs to lead”.“I believe it’s critical a company can stand on its own feet, free of its founder’s influence of direction,” he added.Dorsey said the reason behind sharing this email on Twitter was because he wished for it to become the “most transparent company in the world”.Dorsey founded the company in 2006, and posted the platform’s first tweet on March 6. The company went public in 2013, five years after he was ousted 2008. He returned to the company in 2015, after the then CEO Dick Costello stepped down. Dorsey launched payment app Square in the time he was away.The social media giant has 206 million monetizable active daily users worldwide with 24.45 million of them in India.CNBC was the first to report this development, citing sources.Stock prices of Twitter went up by 5% in response to the report.Dorsey faced an ouster move in 2020 when a key shareholder, Elliott Management, called for him to step down from one of the two companies, It dropped the demand in a deal with the company management, according to report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dorsey-steps-down-indian-origin-parag-agrawal-takes-over-as-new-twitter-ceo-101638206614087.html
29-11-2021||World||Not many founders that choose their company over their own ego: Here is what Jack Dorsey wrote in his resignation email||Former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey in his letter to Twitter employees on Monday highlighted why he stepped down and cited three main reasons behind his decision. He also explained why he chose Twitter CTO Parag Agarwal to lead the social media giant. Jack also shared his letter on Twitter with the tweet, “not sure anyone has heard but, I resigned from Twitter,” and the subject of his letter to his employees was ‘Fly’.Here is what Jack Dorsey told Twitter employees before resigning as CEO:Hello team.After almost 16 years of having a role at our company...from co-founder to CEO to Chair to Exec Chair to interim-CEO to CEO...I decided it’s finally time for me to leave. Why?There’s a lot of talk about the importance of a company being “founder-led.” Ultimately I believe that’s severely limiting and a single point of failure. I've worked hard to ensure this company can break away from its founding and founders. There are 3 reasons I believe now is the right time.The first is Parag becoming our CEO. The board ran a rigorous process considering all options and unanimously appointed Parag. He’s been my choice for some time given how deeply he understands the company and its needs. Parag has been behind every critical decision that helped turn this company around. He’s curious, probing, rational, creative, demanding, self-aware, and humble. He leads with heart and soul, and is someone I learn from daily. My trust in him as our CEO is bone deep.The second is Bret Taylor agreeing to become our board chair. I asked Bret to join our board when I became CEO, and he’s been excellent in every way. He understands entrepreneurship, taking risks, companies at massive scale, technology, product, and he’s an engineer. All of the things the board and the company deserve right now. Having Bret in this leadership role gives me a lot of confidence in the strength of our board going forward. You have no idea how happy this makes me!The third is all of you. We have a lot of ambition and potential on this team. Consider this: Parag started here as an engineer who cared deeply about our work and now he’s our CEO (I also had a similar path...he did it better!). This alone makes me proud. I know that Parag will be able to channel this energy best because he’s lived it and knows what it takes. All of you have the potential to change the course of this company for the better. I believe this with all my heart!Parag is CEO starting today. I’m going to serve on the board through my term (May-ish) to help Parag and Bret with the transition. And after that...I’ll leave the board. Why not stay or become chair? I believe it’s really important to give Parag the space he needs to lead. And back to my previous point, I believe it’s critical a company can stand on its own, free of its founder’s influence or direction.I want you all to know that this was my decision and I own it. It was a tough one for me, of course. I love this service and company...and all of you so much. I’m really sad...yet really happy. There aren’t many companies that get to this level. And there aren’t many founders that choose their company over their own ego. I know we'll prove this was the right move.We'll have an all-hands meeting tomorrow at 9:05 AM Pacific to discuss it all. Until then, thank you all for the trust you’ve placed in me, and for the openness to build that trust in Parag and yourselves. I love you all.jackPS: I’m tweeting this email. My one wish is for Twitter Inc to be the most transparent company in the world.

29-11-2021||World||Russia says Sputnik Omicron booster on the cards||The backers of the Russian Covid-19 vaccine Sputnik V said Monday that the jab is effective against the new Omicron coronavirus variant but they were also developing an adapted booster.The Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which supported the vaccine's development by the state-run Gamaleya Center, said that the centre "has already begun developing the new version of Sputnik vaccine adapted to Omicron.""In an unlikely case such modification is needed, the new Sputnik Omicron version can be ready for mass-scale production in 45 days," RDIF said in a statement. "Several hundred million Sputnik Omicron boosters can be provided to international markets already by February 20, 2022 with over 3 billion doses available in 2022."The promise comes after the US pharmaceutical company Moderna said Friday that it will develop a booster shot against the highly mutated strain of the coronavirus, which is more transmissible than the dominant Delta variant.Germany's BioNTech and US drugmaker Pfizer said the same day that they expect data "in two weeks at the latest" to show if their jab can be adjusted.Last week RDIF said Sputnik V provides longer immunity against the coronavirus than Western jabs using messenger RNA (mRNA) technology.It added that the Sputnik vaccine is 80 percent effective against the coronavirus between six and eight months after the second dose.No independent study has confirmed the claim.Russia registered Sputnik V last August ahead of large-scale clinical trials, prompting concern among experts over the fast-tracked process.But it was since declared safe and over 90 percent effective in a report published by leading medical journal The Lancet. The RDIF says its two-dose vaccine has been approved in 71 countries and that it has applied for registration in the European Union.Earlier this summer several Latin American countries that have relied on the Russian vaccine to protect their populations complained to Moscow about delivery delays. emg/gwPFIZERBioNTech||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-says-sputnik-omicron-booster-on-the-cards-101638202886611.html
29-11-2021||World||Omicron variant underlines need for global 'pandemic treaty', says WHO||The emergence of the omicron variant shows how "perilous and precarious" the situation is, the WHO's chief warned. The EU and Germany's Merkel have backed negotiations on an accord to prevent future pandemics.As concern grows over the omicron variant, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Monday the panicked reactions by world leaders showed the urgent need for a global accord on pandemics."The emergence of the highly mutated omicron variant underlines just how perilous and precarious our situation is," said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at the start of a three-day World Health Assembly meeting.He said scientists around the world are "urgently" working to determine whether the omicron variant, first identified in South Africa, is more infectious or whether vaccines are effective against it.The UN health agency chief, however, emphasized that the 194-member World Health Assembly needs to ensure that the groundwork is laid for an accord that can prevent future pandemics."We shouldn't need another wake-up call," Tedros said.Why did the WHO label omicron as 'high risk'?Earlier on Monday, the WHO released a statement with the latest assessment of the omicron variant — designating it as a bringing a "very high" risk of global infection surges.While it remains to be seen whether the variant increases the risk of severe disease or death — the multiple mutations in the past have led to a higher risk of recurring infections in patients who have already recovered from Covid-19."Depending on these characteristics, there could be future surges of Covid-19, which could have severe consequences, depending on a number of factors including where surges may take place," the WHO said in a statement.How much support is there for a pandemic accord?Leaders from Germany and the European Union threw their support behind a global pandemic pact, calling for more stable financing for the WHO."I would like us member states to increase our contributions significantly — this means up to 50%," said acting Chancellor Angela Merkel.The outgoing German leader also backed efforts to make a pandemic prevention accord legally binding — which is currently not on the table in the draft agreement.The United States has been hesitant to agree to sign on to a legally binding treaty, but reached a compromise with other member states to kick start the process for a global "accord."What is in the draft?The draft, which is expected to be adopted by the end of the talks on Wednesday, sets out the long-term steps.Countries have tentatively agreed to establish an intergovernmental body that will draft and negotiate an accord. The accord itself will focus on three areas: pandemic prevention, preparedness and pandemic response.A treaty, accord, or another type of agreement won't likely be ready for years. The deadline is currently set at 2024.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-variant-underlines-need-for-global-pandemic-treaty-says-who-101638202277631.html

29-11-2021||World||Chinese province commissions surveillance system to target journalists, foreign students||Security officials in one of China's largest provinces have commissioned a surveillance system they say they want to use to track journalists and international students among other "suspicious people", documents reviewed by Reuters showed.A July 29 tender document published on the Henan provincial government’s procurement website - reported in the media for the first time - details plans for a system that can compile individual files on such persons of interest coming to Henan using 3,000 facial recognition cameras that connect to various national and regional databases.A 5 million yuan ($782,000) contract was awarded on Sept. 17 to Chinese tech company Neusoft, which was required to finish building the system within two months of signing the contract, separate documents published on the Henan government procurement website showed. Reuters was unable to establish if the system is currently operating.Shenyang-based Neusoft did not respond to requests for comment.China is trying to build what some security experts describe as one of the world's most sophisticated surveillance technology networks, with millions of cameras in public places and increasing use of techniques such as smartphone monitoring and facial recognition.U.S.-based surveillance research firm IPVM, which has closely tracked the network's expansion and first identified the Henan document, said the tender was unique in specifying journalists as surveillance targets and providing a blueprint for public security authorities to quickly locate them and obstruct their work."While the PRC has a documented history of detaining and punishing journalists for doing their jobs, this document illustrates the first known instance of the PRC building custom security technology to streamline state suppression of journalists," said IPVM'S Head of Operations Donald Maye, using the initials of the People's Republic of China.Reuters was unable to find any documents identifying journalists or foreigners as specific targets of surveillance systems in other parts of China.The Henan provincial government and police did not respond to requests for comment. The Ministry of Public Security and China's Foreign Ministry also did not comment."Tailed and Controlled"The near-200 page tender document from the Henan Public Security Department does not give reasons why it wants to track journalists or international students. Another category of people it said it wants to track were "women from neighbouring countries that are illegal residents."Public access to the tender document was disabled on Monday.The tender document specified cameras must be able to build a relatively accurate file for individuals whose faces are partially covered by a mask or glasses, and those targeted must be searchable on the database by simply uploading a picture or searching their facial attributes.The system will be operated by at least 2,000 officials and policemen, and specifies that journalists will be divided into three categories: red, yellow, green, in decreasing order of risk, according to the tender.Different police forces covering all of Henan, whose 99 million inhabitants makes it China's third-largest province by population, will be connected to the platform in order to spring into action in the event of a warning being set off, the tender explains.Warnings will be set off if a journalist while in Henan registers into a hotel, buys a ticket, or crosses the provincial border, according to the tender."Suspicious persons must be tailed and controlled, dynamic research analyses and risk assessments made, and the journalists dealt with according to their category," the tender reads.The tender also detailed different early warning systems for the other groups.Media ControlSome press freedom groups say the ruling Chinese Communist Party has tightened control over media since Chinese President Xi Jinping took office in 2012.In February, the Foreign Correspondents' Club of China (FCCC) said China used coronavirus prevention measures, intimidation and visa curbs to limit foreign reporting in 2020, citing responses to an annual survey of correspondents and interviews with bureau chiefs.The Chinese foreign ministry at the time called the FCCC report "baseless" and said China always welcomed media and journalists from all countries to cover news in China according to the law. "What we oppose is ideological bias against China and fake news in the name of press freedom," a spokesman said.While most of the Henan document refers to journalists, several segments specify "foreign journalists".In October last year, the Henan government published on its procurement platform for prospective suppliers a short summary of the intended project in which it said the system would be "centred on foreigners" and help "protect national sovereignty, security, and interests".The contract was put out for tender on July 29, days after foreign journalists from the BBC, LA Times, Agence France-Presse and others reporting on devastating floods in Henan were targeted by a nationalist campaign on China's heavily censored social media platform Weibo.The FCCC said at the time it was "very concerned to witness the online and offline harassment of journalists" covering the floods. It described how, for instance, one Weibo account asked its 1.6 million followers to report the whereabouts of a foreign journalist who was reporting about the floods.The tender also said the system should be able to track the movements of international students through methods such as mobile phone positioning and travel bookings - particularly during key dates such as the country's national day or annual session of parliament."On...sensitive dates, launch a wartime early warning mechanism," it read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-province-commissions-surveillance-system-to-target-journalists-foreign-students-101638193535331.html

Rival Moderna has said it was working on a redesign of its Covid-19 vaccine for future booster shots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biontech-starts-work-on-omicron-specific-vaccine-101638193772978.html
29-11-2021||World||Pakistan’s move to allow India’s aid to Afghanistan comes with a rider||Pakistan has linked its decision to allow India to transport 50,000 tonnes of wheat and medicines as humanitarian aid to Afghanistan to the condition that the relief materials be moved by Pakistani trucks, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.Officials of the two sides are engaged in discussions to find a solution to the impasse, especially in view of the looming humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.The Indian side is keen on using its own trucks as it wants to ensure that the relief materials directly reach the Afghan people without being diverted in any manner. The Indian side also envisages that the aid will be distributed only through the UN, the people said.India proposed shipping wheat and life-saving medicines to the people of Afghanistan via Pakistani soil on October 7 and received a response from the Pakistan government only on November 24. The people said Pakistan had attached several conditions to the shipment of the relief materials, besides the use of Pakistani trucks, but declined to go into details.It is understood that the Pakistani side is also seeking shipment charges from India for the use of its trucks.The people pointed out that the process of unloading and loading the relief materials at the Wagah land border crossing would add to the logistical issues associated with the transportation of the goods.The Indian side has repeatedly said in recent weeks that there should be unimpeded and unhindered access to Afghanistan for relief supplies and that the United Nations should play a central role in humanitarian efforts.External affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi had made it clear at a news briefing on Friday that no conditions should be attached by Pakistan to the shipment of humanitarian aid.“This was about humanitarian access into Afghanistan for the delivery of the 50,000 metric tonnes of wheat and life-saving medicines we are supplying to the people of Afghanistan,” he said.“We are also working on the modalities with the Pakistan side. We believe that humanitarian assistance should not be subject to conditionalities,” he added.A joint communiqué issued after a meeting of foreign ministers of the Russia-India-China (RIC) mechanism on Friday had called for “immediate and unhindered humanitarian assistance to be provided to Afghanistan” in view of the deteriorating humanitarian situation.Pakistan has for long opposed two-way trade between India and Afghanistan via the Wagah land border crossing. It allowed the former Afghan government to export goods to India via the crossing but barred any transportation of Indian goods to the Afghan side.There are currently no flights between India and Afghanistan, and transporting the materials via Pakistan was seen as the quickest way of getting aid to the Afghan people, who are grappling with food shortages.Pakistan had said recently that it would allow the transportation of Indian wheat and medicines via the Wagah border on an “exceptional basis” for humanitarian purposes and as a goodwill gesture towards the Afghan people.Even a Taliban delegation led by acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, that recently visited Islamabad, had raised the issue of allowing the shipment of the wheat with the top Pakistani leadership.The UN has warned up to 23 million Afghans will be in “crisis or emergency levels of food insecurity” as winter sets in. Ten out of 11 of Afghanistan’s most densely populated urban areas are anticipated to be at emergency levels of food insecurity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistans-move-to-allow-india-s-aid-to-afghanistan-comes-with-a-rider-101638193348567.html
29-11-2021||World||China: Xi Jinping asks PLA to step up recruitment to win future wars||Chinese President Xi Jinping has stressed the need to recruit new talent to support the armed forces’ rapid modernisation and win future wars.Talent holds the key to advancing the high-quality development of the Chinese armed forces, achieving victory in the military competition, and gaining the upper hand in future wars, Xi told a conference on military talent-related work held from Friday to Sunday.Besides being the general secretary of the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC), Xi heads the Central Military Commission (CMC).Strengthening the capabilities to fight and win should be the starting point and ultimate goal of military talent cultivation, Xi Jinping said, calling for “ great efforts to improve military personnel’s scientific literacy and technological know-how to improve their ability to win modern wars”.“He also urged accelerating the building of first-class military schools and training of first-class military personnel,” the Xinhua news agency quoted him as saying at the conference.Meanwhile, the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported on Monday that the Chinese military has allocated resources for 300,000 troops for the frontline roles to encourage younger professionals to join the People’s Liberation Army (PLA).The new allocation comes amid the ongoing Sino-India military friction along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, which has plunged bilateral ties to their worst level in decades.The air force, the rocket (missile) force, and the strategic supporting force were among others which however enlarged with more forces, the Post report said.“The PLA airborne troop units were upgraded from division-level to brigades, while the number of pilots was also increased to support more new-generation fighter jets like the J-20s, J-16s, J-10Cs,” the newspaper quoted Chinese military sources as saying.Xi Jinping’s goal is to turn the PLA into a modern fighting force by 2027, the PLA’s centennial, and a world-class military on a par with the United States by 2050.The SCMP report quoted a CPC publication as reporting that China has expanded its combat forces to adapt to changing risks - despite a years-long push to streamline the PLA.“In a book of commentaries published in mid-November by CPC mouthpiece People’s Daily, military commentator Zhong Xin said the PLA had been “optimising” its personnel structure by deploying more troops to combat roles after reducing three lakh troops,” the report added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-xi-jinping-asks-pla-to-step-up-recruitment-to-win-future-wars-101638192567420.html
29-11-2021||World||How Omicron compares against other WHO-designated variants of concern||The uncertainties around the highly divergent variant of coronavirus, Omicron, has prompted countries to review the easing of restrictions. The World Health Organization (WHO) wrote to member states that the likelihood of potential further spread of Omicron at the global level is “high” and the overall risk related to the variant of concern is “very high”. The variant has a high number of mutations, including about 30 in spike protein, and, according to the UN health agency, some are concerning and may be associated with immune escape potential and higher transmissibility.Omicron is the fifth WHO-designated variant of concern first identified in South Africa last week. The other four variants of concern are Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta.Here’s how Omicron compares against other WHO-designated variants of concern:TransmissibilityThe alpha and beta variants appeared to spread more easily and quickly than the original Sars-CoV-2. The delta variant, first detected in India, was found to be 43% to 90% more transmissible than previous virus variants. While the experts are awaiting more data on Omicron, its detection coincides with a sharp rise in cases in South Africa.Severity of illnessSeveral studies on the alpha variant submitted to Britain’s new and emerging respiratory virus threats advisory group (Nervtag) in January suggested there could be a link to increased risk of death. According to a study published in August, people infected with the delta variant is 50% more likely to be hospitalised than those infected with alpha. For Omicron, the WHO and other health agencies are closely monitoring the impacts from this latest variant of concern.Vaccine efficacyWhile some laboratory studies have shown that the vaccine remains effective against the beta and alpha variant of coronavirus, some studies have suggested that beta and gamma may have mutations with immune escape capability. In the case of delta variant, studies have suggested that the variant of concern is moderately resistant to vaccination. The high number of mutations in regions of the spike protein of omicron can potentially dampen the potency of antibodies.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-omicron-compares-against-other-who-designated-variants-of-concern-101638190640623.html

This Water Lily Pond and Rose is the widest of the three.”“In the Asian art market, the appetite for masterpieces of Western modern and contemporary art has proliferated in recent years in Hong Kong - setting record prices at auctions. This trend could gradually spread northward into mainland China,” the website Artists Studio said in an article ahead of the auction.The market for world-renowned western artists in China has huge potential, wrote Crystal Wilde for CKGSB Knowledge, the quarterly publication for the CKGSB Business School.“As the art market has matured, buyers have developed an interest in Western art, driven by the popularity of international art fairs like “Art021” and the “West Bund Art and Design” fair in Shanghai, as well as an increasing presence of foreign galleries. With a better support network of museums, galleries and experts behind it, Western art, whether it be works of masters like Monet or those of more modern blue-chip artists like Andy Warhol, is now seen by many as a safer investment bet.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/works-of-renowned-western-artists-sell-for-37mn-at-beijing-auction-101638185247122.html

In a technical briefing document for its member states, the UN health agency said that the likelihood of potential further spread of Omicron at the global level is high and the overall risk related to the new variant of concern has been assessed as “very high”“Depending on these characteristics, there could be future surges of Covid-19, which could have severe consequences, depending on a number of factors including where surges may take place,” the report said.Currently, the local transmission of Omicron has been reported in South Africa and the variant has now been detected in four WHO regions: African; Eastern Mediterranean; European; and Western Pacific. The UN agency said that most of the cases outside Africa are travel-related, it expects local transmission in other countries as more information becomes available.Risk related to Covid variant Omicron 'very high', warns WHOThe WHO has suggested a number of priority actions for member states to curb the spread of the new virus variant, including enhanced surveillance and sequencing efforts and widespread use of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.’s PCR test to detect the variant.Here are some of the immediate actions for member states as suggested by WHO:||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-lists-suggestions-for-countries-as-omicron-poses-very-high-overall-risk-101638178306475.html
29-11-2021||World||Risk related to Covid variant Omicron 'very high', warns WHO||The World Health Organization (WHO) on Monday warned that the risk related to Omicron – the new variant of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) – is "very high". The global health body said that the B.1.1.529 strain, first found in South Africa, is “highly divergent” and likely to spread internationally at a very high speed and could possibly have "severe consequences."Omicron has an unprecedented number of spike mutations, some of which are concerning for their potential impact on the trajectory of the pandemic," the WHO said. “The overall global risk related to the new variant of concern Omicron is assessed as very high,” it noted.Earlier the WHO had said that it was “not yet clear” whether the newly-detected virus variant was more transmissible or causes more severe consequences compared to the previously known strains, especially the Delta variant.Delta variant was the cause behind India's horrifying second wave of Covid-19 pandemic.The WHO also said that researchers in South Africa and around the world are conducting studies to better understand many aspects of Omicron and will continue to share the findings of these studies as they become available.The UN agency, however, urged its 194 member states to boost vaccinations and ensure “mitigation plans are in place” for essential health services.“The use of masks, physical distancing, ventilation of indoor space, crowd avoidance, and hand hygiene remain key to reducing transmission of SARS CoV-2 even with the emergence of the Omicron variant," the WHO said, urging countries to increase contact tracing of Covid-19 cases.Currently, the Omicron variant has not been reported in India. However, two clusters from Maharashtra and Karnataka are under investigation, the Indian government said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/risk-related-to-covid-variant-omicron-very-high-warns-who-101638175496616.html
29-11-2021||World||WHO working on better understanding Omicron Covid-19 variant as experts from South Africa say symptoms appear mild||The World Health Organization is working with researchers around the globe to better understand the new coronavirus variant after health experts in South Africa, where omicron was first detected, said it appeared to cause only mild symptoms.There’s no information to suggest that symptoms associated with omicron differ from those caused by other variants, the Geneva-based WHO cautioned Sunday. Some of the earliest reported infections occurred among college students who are more likely to experience less severe illness from Covid-19, and understanding the level of severity of the new strain “will take days to several weeks,” the WHO said.“We don’t have enough data to determine vaccine effectiveness against omicron or disease severity, so any claims about either at this stage are not evidence-based,” said Raina MacIntyre, professor of global biosecurity at the University of New South Wales in Sydney. “So far, the virus has not mutated to become less severe -- in fact the opposite.”Also read | Risk related to Covid variant Omicron 'very high', warns WHOGovernments around the world are banning travelers from South Africa and nearby countries amid fears the new “variant of concern” could evade vaccines, exacerbate Covid surges and frustrate efforts to reopen economies. While news of the new variant wreaked havoc in global markets on Friday, trading in Asia Monday indicated investors were waiting for more clarity, as scientists from the U.S. to Asia work to understand more about omicron’s makeup, its transmissibility, and how lethal it is compared with other strains.The U.K. government will convene an urgent meeting of Group of Seven health ministers Monday to discuss the latest developments, according to the country’s Department of Health. In the U.S., President Joe Biden will also give an update on Monday, the White House said.Omicron was first detected earlier this month. It’s characterized by some 30 or more genetic changes, half of which are in the receptor binding domain -- the part of the spike protein used to bind to human ACE-2, which is the enzyme the coronavirus targets to enter cells and cause an infection. Mutations there can make the spike protein less recognizable to the antibodies produced in response to vaccination or a natural infection.Angelique Coetzee, chair of the South African Medical Association, called symptoms associated with the variant at this point “different and so mild” compared with others she’s treated in recent months.Coetzee, who first spotted what turned out to be the new variant, told the U.K.’s Telegraph newspaper that a number of healthy young men turned up at her clinic “feeling so tired.” About half were unvaccinated.“What we are seeing clinically in South Africa and remember, I’m at the epicenter, that’s where I’m practicing, is extremely mild,” she said Sunday on the BBC’s “Andrew Marr Show.”Click here to know more about the Omicron Covid-19 variant“We haven’t admitted anyone” to the hospital with the new variant, she said. “I spoke to other colleagues of mine, the same picture.”Asked if authorities around the world were panicking unnecessarily, Coetzee said, “Yes, at this stage I would say definitely. Two weeks from now on maybe we will say something different.”Experts elsewhere, however, followed the WHO in urging caution.Richard Lessells, an infectious-diseases physician at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban, said a rapid understanding of disease severity caused by omicron is critical, but it’s too early for reliable data. The time it takes for infections to progress to severe disease or hospitalization means omicron’s impact may not be apparent for a few more weeks.‘Be Cautious’“Observations from clinicians on the ground are always important, and we lean heavily on them, but we need to be cautious about jumping on early reports that all cases with this variant are mild,” Lessells said in a Twitter post Sunday.The variant’s genome contains “some concerning elements,” said Stephen Goldstein, an evolutionary virologist at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. Their affect on vaccine effectiveness should be better known in the next couple of weeks, he said. Omicron also has some mutations near the so-called furin cleavage site of the spike protein that are associated with the increased transmissibility of both the alpha and delta variants.“We’re starting to see cases pop up in other parts of the world, so it appears to be spreading quite quickly, which leads to concerns that it may be even more transmissible than delta, but it really is too soon to say,” Goldstein said in a Zoom interview. Any advantage omicron has may become clearer if it starts spreading in the U.S. and parts of Europe already battling delta-fueled epidemics, he said.Also read | Omicron: Sisodia says can’t lower guard, Centre, states to monitor variantThe average number of daily cases in South Africa jumped to about 1,600 last week from about 500 the previous week and 275 infections in the week before that, President Cyril Ramaphosa said Sunday. The proportion of Covid tests coming back positive jumped to 9% from about 2% in less than a week. Only 36% of adults in South Africa are fully vaccinated.Barry Schoub, chairman of South Africa’s Ministerial Advisory Committee on Vaccines, said there’s been no real uptick in hospitalizations. “The cases that have occurred so far have all been mild cases, mild-to-moderate cases, and that’s a good sign,” Schoub told Sky News on Sunday, adding that it was still early days and nothing was certain yet.No unusual symptoms have been reported following infection with omicron and, as with other variants, some individuals are asymptomatic, South Africa’s National Institute for Communicable Diseases said Friday.Also read | No case of Omicron variant in India, 2 clusters under investigation, says govtAsymptomatic CasesTwo omicron cases detected in Australia and an initial one in Hong Kong occurred in fully vaccinated people who developed no apparent sign of illness. A 62-year-old man who was infected in a quarantine hotel in Hong Kong did develop symptoms. Both places require negative Covid tests for travelers to enter, however, indicating these infections may have been at an early stage.The WHO said there was preliminary data showing a higher number of hospitalizations, “but this may be due to increasing overall numbers of people becoming infected, rather than a result of specific infection with omicron.”The large number of mutations found in the omicron variant appears to destabilize the virus, which might make it less “fit” than the dominant delta strain, said Schoub.“In a way, hopefully it won’t displace delta because delta we know responds very well to the vaccine,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-working-on-better-understanding-omicron-covid-19-variant-as-experts-from-south-africa-say-symptoms-appear-mild-101638173311714.html

The economic collapse has pummelled smaller outlets too.Nehad Rasana-e-Afghanistan (NAI), an organization supporting media in Afghanistan, said that since the Islamic Emirate rule, over 257 media outlets have ceased operating in the country due to financial challenges as well as restrictions. This includes print, radio and TV stations.According to the watchdog, over 70 per cent of media workers have become jobless or left the country.

Ramaphosa said the only thing that travel bans will do is further damage to the economies of affected countries.Since the discovery of the Omicron variant, several countries including the United States (US), the United Kingdom, Japan, Russia, Saudi Arabia and others have imposed travel bans on the affected region in southern Africa. It has been reported that Omicron has a higher number of mutations and spreads very quickly.The United States has given exceptions in its travel ban for American citizens, and permanent residents. On Monday, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced that all international arrivals will be barred, days after the government imposed quarantine rules for Japanese nationals coming back to the country from South Africa and eight other nearby countries.Matshidiso Moeti on Sunday also lauded South Africa for informing the United Nations' body about the variant as soon as it identified it. “The speed and transparency of the South African and Botswana governments in informing the world of the new variant are to be commended," the top WHO official further said.Currently, the WHO has said that it is not yet clear whether omicron is more transmissible or causes more severe disease compared to other variants of Covid-19. It will take days to weeks to understand the level of severity of omicron, the WHO said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-heavy-burden-on-lives-who-criticises-travel-bans-over-omicron-variant-101638158283047.html

On Friday, Canada imposed a ban on foreign nationals travelling to the country from seven southern African nations. However, the two cases detected were not associated with those countries. In a statement released on Sunday, Christine Elliott, deputy premier of the province of Ontario as well as minister of health and Dr Kieran Moore, chief medical officer of health, said, “Today, the province of Ontario has confirmed two cases of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 in Ottawa, both of which were reported in individuals with recent travel from Nigeria. Ottawa Public Health is conducting case and contact management and the patients are in isolation.”Ontario has asked the federal government to mandate “point-of-arrival testing for all travellers irrespective of where they’re coming from”.The ban announced on Friday and valid till January 31 next year was on South Africa, Eswatini, Lesotho, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, and Namibia. Some travellers, including Canadian citizens and permanent residents, were exempt.Canadian authorities warned more cases may be discovered going ahead. Minister of health Jean-Yves Duclos said “As the monitoring and testing continues with provinces and territories, it is expected that other cases of this variant will be found in Canada.”The government also warned Canadians against travelling outside the country, as the Public Health Agency of Canada noted, “Restrictions are changing quickly and may be imposed by countries with little warning, disrupting travel plans. Should individuals choose to travel outside Canada, they may be forced to remain outside of Canada longer than expected.”Early date, it said, pointed to the variant being more transmissible that others earlier but “evidence is limited at this time”.

I want it to be a government of change for the future," Fiala said at a televised news conference, adding that he expected his cabinet to be appointed in mid-December.The new prime minister also called on people to get vaccinated against Covid-19 and praised medical staff as cases are on the rise.Only 58.5% of Czechs are vaccinated against coronavirus. This compares to an average to an European Union average of 65.8%, according to European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.President Zeman performed the inauguration ceremony from a plexiglass cubicle after testing positive for coronavirus. Zeman, who came in a wheelchair escorted by a medic in full protective gear, contracted the virus after a six-week stay in hospital for an unrelated illness.The outgoing government has toughened measures on Thursday, including a ban on Christmas markets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/czech-president-appoints-milos-zeman-petr-fiala-as-pm-in-ceremony-behind-glass-101638152384867.html

The minister said the situation is "volatile" and warned residents to prepare for more evacuation orders, possible increased flooding and closed highways.British Columbia was hit by record rainfall in mid-November that caused widespread flooding and mudslides. The extreme weather damaged and destroyed roads and bridges, forced thousands to evacuate their homes and left at least four dead and one missing.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visited affected areas on Friday, after deploying the military to help with sandbagging."Extreme weather events are going to become more frequent," he warned.This weekend has so far seen up to 130 millimeters (five inches) of rain dumped on parts of British Columbia, plus 30 millimeters of snow melt adding to runoff in already swelled rivers.Localized flooding has been reported in communities near Vancouver, officials said, while minor landslides once again struck several highways into the city, leaving behind rocks, trees and other debris.Ted White of the River Forecast Centre said, "A potentially potent atmospheric river is developing in the Pacific Ocean... (that has) the potential of being an extreme storm" when it makes landfall.amc/sw||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/floodravaged-british-columbia-in-western-canada-braces-for-more-rain-101638143572915.html
29-11-2021||World||Taliban asks EU for help with Afghanistan's airports||The Taliban asked for help in keeping Afghanistan's airports running in weekend talks with EU officials that also raised "grave concern" about the humanitarian situation in their country, according to an EU statement late Sunday.Both sides sent senior officials to the Qatari capital Doha for the talks, which happened just ahead of two weeks of negotiations between the US and the Taliban due to start Monday, also in Doha.The EU's European External Action Service (EEAS) said in its statement that "the dialogue does not imply recognition by the EU of the interim (Taliban) government but is part of EU's operational engagement, in the interest of the EU and the Afghan people".The Taliban delegation was led by interim foreign minister Amir Khan Mutaqqi, accompanied by the interim ministers for education and health, the acting central bank governor, and officials from the foreign, finance and interior ministries and the intelligence directorate.The EU side was headed by the EU special envoy for Afghanistan Tomas Niklasson, with officials from the EEAS and the European Commission's service handling humanitarian aid, international partnerships, and migration.'Worsening humanitarian situation'The EU statement said the Taliban vowed to stick by its promise of "amnesty" for Afghans who had worked against it during the two decades of Western-oriented rule up to the hasty exit and evacuation by the US and its allies in August.The Taliban side also re-committed to allowing Afghans and foreigners to leave if they wish so, but "requested assistance for maintaining operations of airports" so that could happen."The two sides expressed grave concern about the worsening humanitarian situation in Afghanistan as winter is arriving," the statement said, adding that the EU would continue supplying humanitarian aid.The EU side pressed the Taliban to create an "inclusive government", foster democracy, ensure girls had equal access to schooling, and prevent Afghanistan serving as a base for any group "that threatens the security of others".It also suggested that, if the Taliban met EU conditions, that could unlock extra financing for Afghanistan's cash-strapped new rulers but only "for the direct benefit of the Afghan people".The Taliban reiterated they would uphold human rights "in line with Islamic principles" and would welcome back diplomatic missions that had closed, according to the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-asks-eu-for-help-with-afghanistan-s-airports-101638138852877.html
29-11-2021||World||Omicron: Canada confirms first case of new Covid variant||Canada said Sunday it has detected its first cases of the new Omicron strain of Covid, in two people who had traveled recently to Nigeria.Both patients are in isolation while public health authorities trace their possible contacts, said federal and Ontario provincial officials."I was informed today by the Public Health Agency of Canada that testing and monitoring of Covid-19 cases has confirmed two cases of the Omicron variant of concern in Ontario," Health Minister Jean-Yves Duclos said in a statement."As the monitoring and testing continues," he added, "it is expected that other cases of this variant will be found in Canada."The government of Ontario confirmed that the two cases are in the capital Ottawa.The World Health Organization has listed Omicron as a "variant of concern" and countries around the world are now restricting travel from southern Africa, where the new strain was first detected, and taking other new precautions.The WHO says it could take several weeks to know if there are significant changes in transmissibility, severity or implications for Covid vaccines, tests and treatments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-canada-confirms-first-case-of-new-covid-variant-101638138514886.html
29-11-2021||World||South Africa to remain on lowest lockdown level amid Omicron concerns||South Africa will remain on the lowest 'Level One' of its five-level lockdown strategy to fight the Covid-19 pandemic despite the global panic around the detection of the Omicron variant in the country, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced on Sunday.Ramaphosa also called on more than 20 countries that have imposed travel bans to and from South Africa and its neighbours to immediately end the ban to avoid further harm to the economies of these countries, which have already been battered by the pandemic.“In taking the decision not to impose further restrictions at this stage, we considered the fact that when we encountered previous waves of infection, vaccines were not widely available and far fewer people were vaccinated,” Ramaphosa said in a national broadcast.“That is no longer the case. Vaccines are available to anyone aged 12 and above, free of charge, at thousands of sites across the country.“We also know that the coronavirus will be with us for the long term. We must therefore find ways of managing the pandemic while limiting disruptions to the economy and ensuring continuity,” the president added.Commenting on the travel ban, Ramaphosa called for an immediate reversal of the ban.“(The ban) is a clear and completely unjustified departure from the commitment that many of these countries made at the meeting of G20 countries in Rome last month.”“They pledged at that meeting to restart international travel in a safe and orderly manner, consistent with the work of relevant international organisations such as the World Health Organisation, the International Civil Aviation Organisation, the International Maritime Organisation and the OECD.“The G20 Rome Declaration noted the plight of the tourism sector in developing countries, and made a commitment to support a rapid, resilient, inclusive and sustainable recovery of the tourism sector,” Ramaphosa said.“These restrictions are unjustified and unfairly discriminate against our country and our Southern African sister countries. The prohibition of travel is not informed by science, nor will it be effective in preventing the spread of this variant. The only thing the prohibition on travel will do is to further damage the economies of the affected countries and undermine their ability to respond to, and recover from, the pandemic.”Ramaphosa said there was no scientific justification for keeping these restrictions in place.Placing great emphasis on the need to use vaccination as the primary defence tool in fighting the virus, Ramaphosa said a task team led by Deputy President David Mabuza has been established to report back on suggestions that vaccines be made compulsory in some circumstances.“As individuals, as companies and as government, we have a responsibility to ensure that all people in this country can work, travel and socialise safely.“We have therefore been undertaking engagements with social partners and other stakeholders on introducing measures that make vaccination a condition for access to workplaces, public events, public transport and public establishments, “the president said.Ramaphosa said discussion has already been taking place with the business and labour sectors, with broad agreement on the need for compulsory vaccination.He did not comment about the growing anti-vaccination proponents, including some political parties, and even some lawyers who have argued that forcing people to take vaccinations would undermine their constitutional rights.“We realise that the introduction of such measures is a difficult and complex issue, but if we do not address this seriously and as a matter of urgency, we will continue to be vulnerable to new variants and will continue to suffer new waves of infection,” Ramaphosa said.“We also know that the likelihood of the emergence of more severe forms of variants is increased significantly where people are not vaccinated. The emergence of the Omicron variant should be a wake-up call to the world that vaccine inequality cannot be allowed to continue,” the president said as he repeated his call for vaccine inequality to end.“These variants may well be more transmissible, may cause more severe disease, and maybe more resistant to the current vaccines.“Instead of prohibiting travel, the rich countries of the world need to support the efforts of developing economies to access and to manufacture enough vaccine doses for their people without delay,” Ramaphosa concluded.South Africa recorded 3,220 coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours, up from about 100 daily just over a week ago, but scientists said there was no need to panic about Omnicron yet because not enough was known about it.The Omicron variant, feared to spread faster and partially reduce vaccine protection, was identified in South Africa earlier this week and classed as a variant of concern by the World Health Organisation (WHO).A “variant of concern” is the WHO's top category of worrying Covid-19 variants.Countries around the world are currently racing to introduce travel bans and restrictions on southern African countries in an effort to contain Omicron's spread.European countries along with the UK have banned travel to and from South Africa and neighbouring countries of Namibia, Zimbabwe and Botswana, as well as Lesotho and Eswatini (formerly Swaziland), both of which are landlocked within South Africa.Other countries include Mauritius, Israel, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, the US, Canada and the Netherlands.In New Delhi, the Indian government asked all states and union territories to conduct rigorous screening and testing of all international travellers coming from or transiting through South Africa, Hong Kong and Botswana, where the new variant has been detected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-africa-to-remain-on-lowest-lockdown-level-amid-omicron-concerns-101638138165832.html
29-11-2021||World||More omicron cases pop up as world rushes to learn more||Cases of the omicron variant of the coronavirus popped up in countries on opposite sides of the world Sunday and many governments rushed to close their borders even as scientists cautioned that it's not clear if the new variant is more alarming than other versions of the virus.The variant was identified days ago by researchers in South Africa, and much is still not known about it, including whether it is more contagious, more likely to cause serious illness or more able to evade the protection of vaccines. But many countries rushed to act, reflecting anxiety about anything that could prolong the pandemic that has killed more than 5 million people.Israel decided to bar entry to foreigners, and Morocco said it would suspend all incoming flights for two weeks starting Monday — among the most drastic of a growing raft of travel curbs being imposed by nations around the world as they scrambled to slow the variant's spread. Scientists in several places — from Hong Kong to Europe — have confirmed its presence. The Netherlands reported 13 omicron cases on Sunday, and Australia found two.Noting that the variant has already been detected in many countries and that closing borders often has limited effect, the World Health Organization called for frontiers to remain open.Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health in the United States, meanwhile, emphasized that there is no data yet that suggests the new variant causes more serious illness than previous COVID-19 variants."I do think it’s more contagious when you look at how rapidly it spread through multiple districts in South Africa. It has the earmarks therefore of being particularly likely to spread from one person to another. … What we don’t know is whether it can compete with delta,” Collins said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”Collins echoed several experts in saying the news should make everyone redouble their efforts to use the tools the world already has, including vaccinations, booster shots and measures such as mask-wearing.“I know, America, you’re really tired about hearing those things, but the virus is not tired of us,” Collins said.The Dutch public health authority confirmed that 13 people who arrived from South Africa on Friday have so far tested positive for omicron. They were among 61 people who tested positive for the virus after arriving on the last two flights to Amsterdam’s Schiphol airport before a flight ban was implemented. They were immediately put into isolation, most at a nearby hotel.Authorities in Australia said two travelers who arrived in Sydney from Africa became the first in the country to test positive for the new variant. Arrivals from nine African countries are now required to quarantine in a hotel upon arrival. Two German states reported a total of three cases in returning travelers over the weekend.Israel moved to ban entry by foreigners and mandate quarantine for all Israelis arriving from abroad.“Restrictions on the country’s borders is not an easy step, but it’s a temporary and necessary step,” Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting.Morocco's Foreign Ministry tweeted Sunday that all incoming air travel to the North African country would be suspended to “preserve the achievements realized by Morocco in the fight against the pandemic, and to protect the health of citizens.” Morocco has been at the forefront of vaccinations in Africa, and kept its borders closed for months in 2020 because of the pandemic.The U.S. plans to ban travel from South Africa and seven other southern African countries starting Monday.“It’s going to give us a period of time to enhance our preparedness,” the United States’ top infectious diseases expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the ban on ABC’s “This Week.”Many countries are introducing such bans, though they go against the advice of the WHO, which has warned against any overreaction before the variant is thoroughly studied.South Africa's government responded angrily to the travel bans, which it said are “akin to punishing South Africa for its advanced genomic sequencing and the ability to detect new variants quicker.” It said it will try to persuade countries that imposed them to reconsider.The WHO sent out a statement saying it “stands with African nations” and noting that travel restrictions may play “a role in slightly reducing the spread of COVID-19 but place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods." It said if restrictions are put in place, they should be scientifically based and not intrusive.In Europe, much of which already has been struggling with a sharp increase in cases over recent weeks, officials were on guard.The U.K. on Saturday tightened rules on mask-wearing and on testing of international arrivals after finding two omicron cases, but British Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the government was nowhere near reinstituting work from home or more severe social-distancing measures.“We know now those types of measures do carry a very heavy price, both economically, socially, in terms of non-Covid health outcomes such as impact on mental health,” he told Sky News.Spain announced it won't admit unvaccinated British visitors starting Dec. 1. Italy was going through lists of airline passengers who arrived in the past two weeks. France is continuing to push vaccinations and booster shots.David Hui, a respiratory medicine expert and government adviser on the pandemic in Hong Kong, agreed with that strategy.He said the two people who tested positive for the omicron variant had received the Pfizer vaccine and exhibited very mild symptoms, such as a sore throat.“Vaccines should work but there would be some reduction in effectiveness,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-omicron-cases-pop-up-as-world-rushes-to-learn-more-101638136000220.html
29-11-2021||World||A new republic is born as Barbados cuts ties with UK queen||On a rainy night in Hong Kong in 1997, Prince Charles read a message from his mother Queen Elizabeth II, as Britain handed back sovereignty of the territory to China after more than 150 years of UK rule.On Monday, nearly a quarter of a century on, Charles will be present at another handover, when Barbados becomes the world's newest republic, with an elected president -- not the queen -- as head of state.The ceremony will not be on the same scale as in Hong Kong, when military marching bands and bagpipes provided the backdrop to a momentous occasion that was described as "the epilogue of empire".But the Caribbean island's abandonment of constitutional monarchy is significant, not just for the monarch and her heir, but for the new republic -- and others that may follow.Joe Little, the managing editor of Majesty Magazine, said the declaration was a "natural progression" of a trend that began soon after the queen took the throne in 1952."I think inevitably it's one that will continue, not necessarily in this current reign but in the next -- and probably accelerate," he told AFP.Royal officials have said little about the end of nearly four painful centuries of British rule and influence on Barbados, which was a key centre in the slave trade."This is a matter for the government and people of Barbados," Buckingham Palace said when the authorities in Bridgetown set out its intentions last year.However, it sends a clear message that in the twilight of the 95-year-old queen's reign, and when Charles, 73, succeeds, the British monarchy's global reach is diminished.'Democracy day'In 1947, five years before she became queen, Britain saw the "Jewel in the Crown" -- India -- emerge as an independent republic.After Elizabeth took the throne in 1952, independence movements swept Britain's former colonies, severing ties to the crown that were bound by commerce and bloody conquest.But between 1983 and 1987, Elizabeth was still queen of an astonishing 18 countries.Fiji (1987) and Mauritius (1992) have since become republics, following in the footsteps of Caribbean nations Dominica, Guyana, and Trinidad and Tobago in the 1970s.In doing so now, tiny Barbados, with a population of just under 300,000, could start a domino effect in the queen's 14 remaining Commonwealth realms outside Britain.Professor Hilary Beckles, a Barbadian historian, called Monday's event -- on the eve of Barbados' 55th anniversary of independence -- "an historic moment" with far-reaching significance.For Barbados, the Caribbean and all post-colonial societies, it represents freedom from the "tyranny of imperial and colonial authority", and the "brutal legacy" of slavery and genocidal oppression, he said this week."History has given Barbados this responsibility to move forward into the 21st century" with pride, dignity and honour, he added, calling Tuesday "a democracy day".Republican sentimentThe queen has consistently been the most popular royal in Britain and beyond, and is seen as the symbol of the country post-war as well as the last living link to its imperial past.When the succession comes, with the more controversial Charles lacking that history, experts predict the republican question will be asked with more urgency in Commonwealth countries -- and even possibly in the UK.Little said the push for an elected head of state was more than likely in places such as Australia and to a lesser extent Canada.Australians last voted on the the issue in November 1999, but the proposal did not pass.Graham Smith, from the anti-monarchy pressure group Republic, said Barbados' move is "useful" to demonstrate that ditching constitutional monarchy can be done easily."It's going to have a big impact," he said.Jamaica in particular, where both main political parties back the idea of becoming a republic, could see it as a "prompt", he added.In Britain, a YouGov poll in May indicated support for scrapping the monarchy was low among older age groups, dropping to just 13 percent among those aged 65 and over.In contrast, 41 percent of those aged 18 to 24 said they wanted an elected head of state.Smith attributed that to changing attitudes to monarchy, a greater awareness about the legacies of colonialism and support for anti-racism movements and a fairer society."As the older generation starts to die, we're going to see a big spike in support for republicanism," he said."I think the only people that think monarchy has a big role to play are the British and the royal family."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-new-republic-is-born-as-barbados-cuts-ties-with-uk-queen-101638134714220.html

It also deployed missile systems to monitor them.Sunday’s incursion included 18 fighter jets and five H-6 bombers, as well as a Y-20 aerial refueling aircraft, according to Taiwan’s defence ministry.The Chinese aircraft flew into Taiwan’s air defence identification zone near the southern part of the island and out into the Pacific Ocean before returning to China, according to a map by Taiwan authorities.It’s the largest deployment of Chinese warplanes since a record 52 aircraft were detected close to Taiwan in early October.This comes after a US lawmaker defied a Chinese demand that she abandon a trip to the island. Elissa Slotkin, a Democrat from Michigan, wrote on Twitter after landing in Taiwan Thursday that her office received a “blunt message” from the Chinese embassy to call off the trip. The trip also includes Japan and South Korea.Over the past year, the frequency of Chinese incursions has increased, with about 150 aircraft over a period of four days. China’s air force mission toward Taiwan came as Chinese President Xi Jinping met with officers at a military conference, where he called for military talent cultivation to support and strengthen the armed forces, according to state-owned news agency Xinhua.Xi said that talent is imperative in achieving victory in military competition and gaining the upper hand in future wars, according to Xinhua.China claims democratically ruled Taiwan as its own territory, to be brought under its control by force if necessary. It refuses to recognize the island’s government and has increasingly sought to isolate the independence-leaning administration of President Tsai Ing-wen.Taiwan and China split during a civil war in 1949, and Beijing opposes Taiwan’s involvement in international organisations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-sees-biggest-flyby-of-chinese-warplanes-since-oct-101638131182156.html
29-11-2021||World||UK seeks ‘urgent’ talks with Europe after French snub||Britain’s government on Sunday announced plans for its own talks on the Channel migration crisis with European ministers this week as it was frozen out of a crisis meeting in France.Home secretary Priti Patel was barred from Sunday’s meeting in Calais, after Prime Minister Boris Johnson published the text of a letter to French President Emmanuel Macron setting out London’s demands for concerted action.But following the tragic drownings of 27 people in the Channel last Wednesday, she tweeted: “I will be holding urgent talks with my European counterparts this week to prevent further tragedies in the Channel.”There was no immediate comment from Patel’s interior ministry on the venue or timing of the talks. But Patel used a commentary piece in the Sun on Sunday newspaper to spell out the need for joint action, and for tougher UK legislation, as she comes under pressure in right-wing media and from her own Conservative party to get a grip on the crisis.“There is still so much more we can do and I am sorry not to be at a meeting with European ministerial counterparts today to discuss this pressing issue,” she wrote in the tabloid.France sought help from its European neighbours on Sunday to crack down on Channel people-smuggling gangs, with interior minister Gerald Darmanin saying he could “not accept” any more deaths.Ministers responsible for immigration from France, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium convened in the northern French port of Calais.“The biggest point for this meeting is the fight against people-smugglers who take advantage of our borders and countries,” Darmanin said at the start of the event, adding that “migratory pressures continue and are constantly increasing”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-seeks-urgent-talks-with-europe-after-french-snub-101638130838456.html

That led to breaches of the deal by Tehran, and dismayed the other powers involved.Israel, which is not a party to the talks, opposed the original 2015 pact as too limited in scope and duration. Israeli leaders have long threatened military action against Iran if they deem diplomacy a dead end for denying it nuclear weaponry.The Islamic Republic says its nuclear ambitions are peaceful.“Israel is very worried about the readiness to remove the sanctions and to allow a flow of billions (of dollars) to Iran in exchange for unsatisfactory restrictions in the nuclear realm,” Bennett told his cabinet in televised remarks.“This is the message that we are relaying in every manner, whether to the Americans or to the other countries negotiating with Iran.”Few expect a breakthrough in the talks as Iran’s uranium enrichment activities have escalated in an apparent bid to gain leverage against the West. Six rounds of indirect talks were held between April and June.The new round begins after a hiatus caused by the election of a new Iranian president, Ebrahim Raisi, a hardline cleric.Diplomats say time is running low to resurrect the pact.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-worries-iran-will-get-sanctions-relief-without-capping-nuclear-projects-101638130417963.html
29-11-2021||World||Scratchy throat, unfamiliar symptoms: South African doctor reveals details of Omicron cases||Amid worldwide concerns over Covid's new variant Omicron, which is believed to be more transmissible than the previous variants, a South African doctor who raised the alarm over this new variant revealed that the patients she treated had unfamiliar symptoms. However, the symptoms were mild and her patients recovered fully without hospitalisation. Angelique Coetzee, chair of the South African Medical Association, told AFP she had seen around 30 patients over the past 10 days who tested positive for Covid-19 but had unfamiliar symptoms.The Omicron patients reported extreme tiredness, mild muscle aches, a scratchy throat and dry cough, the doctor told AFP. Only a few had a slightly high temperature.Coetzee had alerted the health officials that the clinical picture was not fitting Delta, the dominant variant of South Africa. By that time, scientists have already picked up the variant and were working on it.Omicron: Why the new coronavirus variant is so scary? Experts explain"We are not saying that there will not be severe disease coming forward. But for now, even the patients that we have seen who are not vaccinated have mild symptoms. "I'm quite sure... a lot of people in Europe already have this virus," Coetzee said.The patients that Coetzee treated were mostly men aged under 40 and under half of them were vaccinated.The variant has brought much ignominy to South Africa and countries have started isolating South Africa by imposing a blanket ban on travellers. South Africa's top health federation has termed this as a 'knee-jerk' reaction.Angelique Coetzee who is also the chairperson of the South African Medical Association said South Africa should instead be lauded and not vilified for the alertness the scientists have shown. "My suspicion is that because our scientists are very alert and doing a lot of sequencing in the background, maybe those European countries missed it because of the symptoms," Coetzee told TV news channel Newzroom Afrika.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scratchy-throat-unfamiliar-symptoms-south-african-doctor-reveals-details-of-omicron-cases-101638115538400.html
