The Dutch health authorities are analysing the remaining samples. The cases rising in the Netherlands indicate that the omicron variant is spreading across Europe as it already battles with rising cases in Austria, Netherlands, Germany and Denmark among others.German health authorities also reported fresh cases of omicron variant in Essen and Dusseldorf, news agency Bloomberg reported citing German news outlets.Australia, Hong Kong and Israel are among the countries outside of Europe that have identified cases of the new variant.Experts feel that the current vaccines may not be able to protect from this variant first found in southern African nations of South Africa and Botswana.Moderna Inc. Chief Medical Officer Paul Burton told news agencies that he suspects that the variant may elude current vaccines. “We should know about the ability of the current vaccine to provide protection in the next couple of weeks. If we have to make a brand new vaccine, I think that’s going to be early 2022 before that’s really going to be available in large quantities,” Burton was quoted as saying by news agencies BBC and Bloomberg.European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said vaccine manufacturers needed a few weeks to understand the quality of mutations. “We know we are now in a race against time,” von der Leyen was quoted as saying by news agency AFP.Among southern African nations Angola became the first to suspend all flights from Mozambique, Namibia and South Africa, news agency AFP reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/race-against-time-omicron-adds-to-europe-s-growing-covid-woes-101638121975841.html
28-11-2021||World||Dutch cluster suggests Omicron has a foothold in Europe||The 13 omicron Covid-19 cases identified in the Netherlands on Sunday -- along with additional ones confirmed in Germany and the U.K. -- suggest the new variant already has a strong foothold in Europe. Vaccine makers are racing to evaluate the new strain to see if new formulations will be required. There are indications the symptoms associated with omicron are mild, top South African health officials said. Dutch authorities said they found the cases among 61 people who tested positive for Covid on two flights that arrived from southern Africa on Friday.  About 10% of the travelers on the flights from Cape Town and Johannesburg tested positive for Covid-19. Analysis of the remaining samples is continuing, said Dutch Health Minister Hugo de Jonge. The other travelers have dispersed around Europe and the world. “It is not unlikely more cases will appear in the Netherlands,” de Jonge told a news conference in Rotterdam. “This could possibly be the tip of the iceberg.”Omicron: 5 measures by India to contain spread of new variant detected in AfricaThe Dutch cases mark the most widespread incidence of the new strain in Europe found so far, but the variant has been confirmed or is suspected in at least seven other countries. Germany on Sunday confirmed cases among two people who arrived last week from southern Africa into Munich and one into Frankfurt. More suspected cases are being investigated Two cases confirmed by the U.K. on Saturday -- plus another on Sunday -- along with two in Denmark, all involved travelers from southern Africa. Austria, Belgium and the Czech Republic have suspected or confirmed cases. Australia, Hong Kong and Israel have identified cases, too.  In Campania, Italy, a double-vaccinated traveler who’d recently returned from Mozambique was confirmed as having the new variant, according to Italy’s National Health Institute. The man’s family was also positive and is isolating, with tests under way to determine the strain, authorities said. The swift emergence of omicron threatens to hammer Europe as governments try to deal with a fourth wave of coronavirus cases driven by the infectious delta strain. Austria is in its fourth coronavirus lockdown, the Netherlands has imposed a series of tighter measures, and Germany’s health care system is straining. In many countries, vaccine coverage is far short of levels thought to confer herd immunity -- even as a new strain emerges that may elude current shots. Governments have used the new variant to once again urge residents to get vaccinated -- either with their initial shots or with boosters. The U.K. is leaning on a strong vaccination program as its best defense, and will accelerate booster shots.Global markets were upended on Friday as the news of the latest mutation spurred investors to seek havens rather than bet on assets tied to economic growth. Markets in the Middle East followed when trading opened on Sunday. The European Union moved on Friday to shut down air traffic from southern Africa, and much of the world has followed. The cases so far have been in people who flew before the restrictions were made. The omicron strain has spread rapidly in South Africa, pushing daily coronavirus cases into the thousands from a few hundred earlier in the month. The variant appears to be highly contagious, but it’s unknown how the symptoms compare with other strains of the virus, or whether current vaccines are less effective. Barry Schoub, chair of South Africa’s ministerial advisory committee on Covid-19 vaccines, said Sunday that symptoms associated with the new variant may turn out to be less serious. “Because it has got all these mutations, it does in fact destabilize the virus, it might make it less fit” than the currently dominant delta strain, Schoub said on the BBC’s “Andrew Marr Show.”  “The cases that have occurred so far have all been mild cases, mild to moderate cases, and that’s a good sign.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dutch-cluster-suggests-omicron-has-a-foothold-in-europe-101638118347606.html
28-11-2021||World||China faces ‘colossal’ Covid outbreak if it opens up like US: Study||China could see more than 600,000 Covid cases daily if it mimics anti-pandemic strategies implemented in the US, lifts travel bans, or drops its “zero-tolerance” approach against the virus, new research by Peking University experts said.In the study, published last week by the Chinese Centre for Disease Control’s (CDC) weekly, four researchers have warned of a “colossal outbreak”, which would put an “unaffordable burden” on the country’s health system if Beijing moved away from its current anti-Covid strategies.“More efficient vaccinations or more specific treatment, preferably the combination of both, are needed before entry-exit quarantine measures and other Covid response strategies in China can be safely lifted,” the study said.“The estimates revealed the real possibility of a colossal outbreak which would almost certainly put an unbearable burden on the medical system,” the study added.The research paper, titled On Coexistence with Covid-19: Estimations and Perspectives, compared China’s anti-epidemic measures with that of five other countries: the US, UK, Israel, Spain and France.Despite local and even inter-provincial outbreaks in recent months, China has been able to control the spread of the coronavirus within the country since it first emerged from the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019. There were 98,631 total confirmed Covid cases on mainland China as of Saturday, while the death toll stood at 4,636.Brushing aside criticism against the policy being “unsustainable”, China has continued to implement the “zero-Covid” policy through strict lockdowns for even a handful of cases, efficient contact tracing, hard quarantine measures, and controlled or closed international borders.It also involves large-scale nucleic acid testing, and strict travel and health code management.The new study concluded that the current policies would have to continue in China to prevent any new explosive outbreak of the disease. The study used data for August from the five countries with the researchers looking at the potential results if China adopted similar pandemic response strategies.The study estimated that China would have 637,155 if it implements the same strategies as the US; 454,198 in the case of France; and 275,793 in the case of UK. The research said four tenets for the safe transition from elimination strategies to open-up strategies were needed: Retain flexible non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), maximise vaccination coverage, shield industries and vulnerable groups from the unintended consequences resulting from NPIs, and detect and isolate Covid promptly using extensive surveillance and stronger community social responsibility.“However, due to the large population and relatively scarce health resources per capita in China, it is difficult to fully achieve tenets 1, 3, and 4, especially during a large-scale outbreak; therefore, China needs to be cautious about the decision on the open-up.”The study raised a “clear warning that, for the time being, we are not ready to embrace ‘open-up’ strategies resting solely on the hypothesis of herd immunity induced by vaccination advocated by certain western countries”.Separately, Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist at the Chinese CDC said on Sunday that without the zero-tolerance policy and prevention of overseas importation, there would have been “47.84 million infections and 950,000 deaths based on global pathogenicity and mortality rates”.Wu added that China’s Covid prevention policies were similar to the other BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) countries, the country could have logged 54.97 million infections and over 1.14 million deaths.Wu was speaking at Caijing magazine’s annual forecasts and strategies conference in Beijing on Sunday.Wu said that “mathematical models show that Omicron is more contagious than Delta...but it’s clear that whatever the mutation, our public health measures are effective. Public health measures like wearing masks and social distancing are effective against all mutated strains”.“The prevailing strains this winter and next spring are mainly the Delta strain. Whether the South African variant strain Omicron can develop into the dominant strain needs further observation,” Wu was quoted as saying by Chinese state media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-faces-colossal-covid-outbreak-if-it-opens-up-like-us-study-101638114261465.html
28-11-2021||World||Australia’s new plan to unmask and tackle online trolls. All you need to know||Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Sunday said his government will introduce legislation aimed at unmasking online trolls and holding social media companies accountable for identifying them. The government has termed the legislation a “world-leading” move to “better protect” Australians.Morrison told reporters that anonymous accounts on social media have the capability to bully, harass and ruin lives without consequence and the reforms brought by the government will tackle the online trolls.“We would not accept these faceless attacks in a school, at home, in the office, or on the street. And we must not stand for it online, on our devices and in our homes,” Morrison said.“We cannot allow social media platforms to provide a shield for anonymous trolls to destroy reputations and lives. We cannot allow social media platforms to take no responsibility for the content on their platforms. They cannot enable it, disseminate it, and wash their hands of it. This has to stop,” he added.How the government is planning to unmask online trolls?The legislation would require global social media giants to establish a “quick, simple and standardised” complaints system to ensure defamatory remarks are removed and trolls are identified with their consent.It will introduce new court powers requiring social media giants to disclose identifying details of trolls, without their consent, to victims. The identification will enable the victims to lodge a defamation case.The government said that the legislation will ensure Australians and Australian organisations with a social media page are “not legally considered publishers and cannot be held liable for any defamatory comments posted on their page.” This is in response to a case in which Australia’s apex court ruled that Australians who maintain social media pages can be ‘publishers’ of defamatory comments made by others.“Since the High Court’s decision in the Voller case, it is clear that ordinary Australians are at risk of being held legally responsible for defamatory material posted by anonymous online trolls,” the Australian attorney-general Michaelia Cash said.“The reforms will make clear that, in defamation law, Australians who operate or maintain a social media page are not ‘publishers’ of comments made by others,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australias-new-plan-to-unmask-and-tackle-online-trolls-all-you-need-to-know-101638103657179.html
28-11-2021||World||‘Nothing will move us’: Solomon Islands PM vows to stay in power||The prime minister of the riot-hit Solomon Islands defied pressure to resign Sunday, saying a wave of torching and looting that swept the capital had been orchestrated by a few people with "evil intention" to topple him. Shattered glass and rubble still lined the streets of Honiara as Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare addressed the nation, a reminder of the three-day eruption in violence blamed partly on poverty, hunger and frustration with his policies."It is very clear that the recent events were well planned and orchestrated to remove me as the prime minister for unsubstantiated reasons," Sogavare said, after a night-time curfew and roughly 150 foreign peacekeepers from Australia and Papua New Guinea helped to restore some calm over the weekend."I want to show the nation that the government is fully intent and nothing will move us. We must and will never bow down to the evil intention of a few people," Sogavare said.Many residents of the Pacific island nation of 800,000 people believe his government is corrupt and beholden to Beijing and other foreign interests.During the riots, mobs attempted to torch the prime minister's private residence and parliament before being dispersed by police firing tear gas and warning shots.Sogavare has already blamed the violence, which incinerated swathes of the capital, on an unscrupulous few leading the people astray with false information. He has claimed that foreign powers opposed to his 2019 decision to switch the Solomons' diplomatic allegiance from Taiwan to China are behind the disturbances.On Sunday, the prime minister said the violence had caused 200 million Solomon Islander dollars (US$ 25 million) in damage and destroyed 1,000 jobs in an economy already squeezed by the impact of the Covid pandemic.The government was working on a recovery package to help damaged businesses recover, Sogavare said. And he repeated a promise that the unidentified "instigators" would face the "full brunt" of the law. Over 100 people have been arrested for riot-related activity, the Solomon Islands police said this weekend.Despite the relative calm of the weekend, people were fearful for the outlook, Red Cross official Kennedy Waitara told AFP.Waitara said many of the food shops in Chinatown had been burned down in the riots. "It will not be surprising if we have to experience food shortages and a hike in prices," he said.- Living in fear -"Unemployment will certainly increase in the coming weeks as people will certainly be out of jobs now and will be finding it difficult."The Red Cross official said he had already seen some shops raising prices for rice and other goods. People were also starting to queue for gasoline.Many people were too nervous even to attend church, said Nason Ta'ake, a youth leader at the Wesley United Church in Honiara."There are only a few people attending church services as most are still living in fear," Ta'ake said.After leaving church, parishioners began scouring shops for food and essential goods but very few were open, he said.Two years of pandemic-induced closed borders have left the already ravaged Solomons economy in tatters, deepening widespread joblessness and poverty.An early estimate of the cost, released this weekend by the Central Bank of the Solomon Islands, said 56 buildings in the capital had been burned and looted, with many businesses facing over a year-long recovery.Local police said this weekend that a forensic team was working to identify the charred remains of three bodies found in a shop in the city's burnt-out Chinatown district. The Red Cross official reported few other serious injuries.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Sunday he was being regularly briefed about the deployment of peacekeepers in the Solomon Islands, adding that he expected Fiji to also contribute troops."Although things are very unstable, at this point there are no areas to our knowledge where there has been loss of control," Morrison told reporters.As tensions escalated last week, the Solomon Islands prime minister had begged neighbours for urgent help. In a letter to Papua New Guinea counterpart James Marape seen by AFP, he called for peacekeepers to be sent for a "period of three to four weeks".burs-djw/je||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nothing-will-move-us-solomon-islands-pm-vows-to-stay-in-power-101638102205765.html

The seven people included three vaccinated individuals and all were placed in isolation.The new coronavirus variant has been detected in South Africa that scientists say is a concern because of its high number of mutations and rapid spread.Israel, a country of 9.3. million people, has reported at least 8,184 deaths from coronavirus since the start of the pandemic.Most of its population — over 6.3 million people — has received at least one dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, and more than 4 million Israelis have received a booster. It has more than 7,000 active cases, 120 of them hospitalized in serious condition, according to Health Ministry statistics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-tightens-travel-restrictions-over-new-covid-variant-101638087259969.html

They are currently in isolation at a special health accommodation provided, the federal health department added.Notably, these two passengers were among the 14 people from southern Africa who arrived on the Doha-Sydney Qatar Airways flight on Saturday evening. After two of them tested positive for Covid-19, the other 12 have been sent to 14 days of hotel quarantine in the special health accommodation.Moreover, around 260 other passengers and the crew aboard the flight, who are considered ‘close contacts’ of these passengers, have also been directed to isolate, the statement added.On the other side of the world, Europe has also detected cases of the omicron variant across the continent, with UK prime minister Boris Johnson imposing new measures to stem the spread. Countries across Europe are tightening their own travel restrictions as suspected omicron cases rapidly emerge. Starting on Saturday, Switzerland required passengers coming from the UK to show proof of vaccination and negative Covid-19 tests upon arrival.Beginning on December 1, Spain will also only begin allowing vaccinated travellers arriving from the country.Austria also registered its first suspected case of a person infected with the omicron variant of the virus. Authorities in Tyrol, on the border with Germany, said the fully-vaccinated patient travelled back from South Africa three days ago and wasn’t showing any symptoms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-coronavirus-variant-makes-its-way-to-australia-cases-detected-in-sydney-101638079795741.html

It has now killed nearly 5.2 million people.In August of this year the US intelligence community released a report in which it said it could not reach a firm conclusion on the origins of the virus -- among animals or in a research lab were top scenarios -- because China had not helped in the US probe.The US has also accused Beijing of waiting too long before sharing crucial information about the outbreak, saying that a more transparent handling could have helped halt the spread of the virus.After the US report was issued this summer, Biden accused Beijing of stonewalling."The world deserves answers, and I will not rest until we get them," Biden said in a statement after that unclassified report came out."Responsible nations do not shirk these kinds of responsibilities to the rest of the world."The pandemic is one of many sources of acute tension today in US-China relations, as the two great powers clash over trade, human rights, and the prickly issue of Taiwan, among other matters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-slap-at-china-us-praises-south-africa-s-quick-detection-of-omicron-covid-19-strain-101638063307503.html

28-11-2021||World||UK, Germany and Italy detect Omicron coronavirus variant cases||Britain, Germany and Italy detected cases of the new Omicron coronavirus variant on Saturday and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced new steps to contain the virus, while more nations imposed restrictions on travel from southern Africa.The discovery of the variant has sparked global concern, a wave of travel bans or curbs and a sell-off on financial markets on Friday as investors worried that Omicron could stall a global recovery from the nearly two-year pandemic.The two linked cases of the new variant detected in Britain were connected to travel to southern Africa, British health minister Sajid Javid said.Speaking later, Johnson laid out measures that included stricter testing rules for people arriving in the country but that stopped short of curbs on social activity other than requiring mask wearing in some settings."We will require anyone who enters the UK to take a PCR test by the end of the second day after their arrival and to self-isolate until they have a negative result," Johnson told a news conference.People who had come into contact with people testing positive for a suspected case of Omicron would have to self-isolate for 10 days and the government would tighten up the rules on wearing face coverings, Johnson said, adding the steps would be reviewed in three weeks.The health ministry in the German state of Bavaria also announced two confirmed cases of the variant. The two people entered Germany at Munich airport on Nov. 24, before Germany designated South Africa as a virus-variant area, and were now isolating, said the ministry, indicating without stating explicitly that the people had travelled from South Africa.In Italy, the National Health Institute said a case of the new variant had been detected in Milan in a person coming from Mozambique.Czech health authorities also said they were examining a suspected case of the variant in a person who spent time in Namibia.Omicron, dubbed a "variant of concern" by the World Health Organization, is potentially more contagious https://www.reuters.com/world/how-worried-should-we-be-about-omicron-variant-2021-11-27 than previous variants of the disease, although experts do not know yet if it will cause more or less severe COVID-19 compared to other strains.England's Chief Medical Officer, Chris Witty, said at the same news conference as Johnson that there was still much uncertainty around Omicron, but "there is a reasonable chance that at least there will be some degree of vaccine escape with this variant".The variant was first discovered in South Africa and had also since been detected in Belgium, Botswana, Israel and Hong Kong.FLIGHTS TO AMSTERDAMDutch authorities said that 61 out of around 600 people who arrived in Amsterdam on two flights from South Africa on Friday had tested positive https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/dutch-find-61-covid-cases-among-south-africa-passengers-looking-new-variant-2021-11-27 for the coronavirus. Health authorities were carrying out further tests to see if those cases involved the new variant.One passenger who arrived from South Africa on Friday, Dutch photographer Paula Zimmerman, said she tested negative but was anxious for the days to come."I’ve been told that they expect that a lot more people will test positive after five days. It's a little scary the idea that you’ve been in a plane with a lot of people who tested positive," she said.Financial markets plunged on Friday, especially stocks of airlines and others in the travel sector, as investors worried the variant could cause another surge in the pandemic. Oil prices tumbled by about $10 a barrel.It could take weeks for scientists to fully understand the variant's mutations and whether existing vaccines and treatments are effective against it.TRAVEL CURBSAlthough epidemiologists say travel curbs may be too late to stop Omicron from circulating globally, many countries around the world - including the United States, Brazil, Canada and European Union nations - announced travel bans or restrictions on southern Africa on Friday.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and State Department added on Saturday to Washington's previously announced travel restrictions, advising against travel to eight southern African countries.Also on Saturday, Australia said it would ban non-citizens who have been in nine southern African countries from entering and will require supervised 14-day quarantines for Australian citizens returning from there.Japan said it would extend its tightened border controls to three more African countries after imposing curbs on travel from South Africa, Botswana, Eswatini, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Lesotho on Friday.Britain also said it was expanding its "red list" to put travel curbs on more southern Africa countries, while South Korea, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Oman, Kuwait and Hungary announced travel restrictions on southern African nations.South Africa is worried that the curbs will hurt tourism and other sectors of its economy, the foreign ministry said on Saturday, adding the government is engaging with countries that have imposed travel bans to persuade them to reconsider.Omicron has emerged as many countries in Europe are already battling a surge in COVID-19 infections, and some have re-introduced restrictions on social activity to try to stop the spread. Austria and Slovakia have entered lockdowns.VACCINATIONSThe new variant has also thrown a spotlight on disparities in how far the world's population is vaccinated. Even as many developed countries are giving third-dose boosters, less than 7% of people in low-income countries have received their first COVID-19 shot, according to medical and human rights groups.Seth Berkley, CEO of the GAVI Vaccine Alliance that with the WHO co-leads the COVAX initiative to push for equitable distribution of vaccines, said this was essential to ward off the emergence of more coronavirus variants.“While we still need to know more about Omicron, we do know that as long as large portions of the world’s population are unvaccinated, variants will continue to appear, and the pandemic will continue to be prolonged," he said in a statement to Reuters."We will only prevent variants from emerging if we are able to protect all of the world’s population, not just the wealthy parts."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-germany-and-italy-detect-omicron-coronavirus-variant-cases-101638054048149.html
28-11-2021||World||Covid-19 vaccine makers study new variant’s impact||The impact the new variant will have on vaccines could become clear relatively soon.BioNTech, which works with Pfizer said it’s beginning lab studies on the variant and should have the first data on how it interacts with the vaccine within two weeks.“In the event that [a] vaccine-escape variant emerges, Pfizer and BioNTech expect to be able to develop and produce a tailor-made vaccine against that variant in approximately 100 days, subject to regulatory approval,” a company spokeswoman said in an email.Moderna said on Friday that it is also working on a high-dose version of the booster, new multivalent boosters and a new booster specific to Omicron. Moderna said it is typically able to get new experimental vaccines into testing in 60 to 90 days.“The mutations in the Omicron variant are concerning and for several days, we have been moving as fast as possible to execute our strategy to address this variant,” said Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel.Mutations may also help Omicron elude the antibody treatments, such as Roche Holding and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals’ Ronapreve, that have become a mainstay of therapy for people who can’t muster an adequate immune response on their own.Roche’s researchers are studying the new variant, said spokesman Karsten Kleine, and it’s too early to say how it will interact with the antibody cocktail.GlaxoSmithKline, which markets a Covid antibody with Vir Biotechnology, said it believes its antibody will probably work against the variant because it targets part of the spike protein that’s shared among many different, distantly related coronaviruses.The company is working urgently to confirm that in the lab, it said in a statement.Johnson & Johnson, the maker of a one-dose Covid-19 shot, is already testing its vaccine against B.1.1.529 variant, CNBC reported, citing the company.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-vaccine-makers-study-new-variant-s-impact-101638048140544.html

28-11-2021||World||Calm returns to Solomons capital after deadly riots||Calm returned to the Solomon Islands' capital Honiara Saturday after days of rioting left at least three dead and reduced sections of the city to smouldering ruins.Petrol stations, shops and other businesses began to reopen, with Honiara residents flocking to buy basic provisions as the violence ebbed."The situation is very tense and anything could happen anytime," said Audrey Awao, a working mother who worried there would soon be no food left in the shops.What began as a small protest on Wednesday quickly descended into a violent free-for-all, with poor Honiara residents joining anti-government protesters to rampage through the shattered glass and burnt-out remains of businesses for things to eat or sell.For three straight days, angry mobs cut through the usually sleepy seaside capital, demanding the removal of Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare.Two years of pandemic-induced closed borders have left the already ravaged Solomons economy in tatters, deepening widespread joblessness and poverty among the population of around 800,000.An early estimate of the cost, released by the Central Bank of the Solomon Islands, said 56 buildings in the capital had been burnt and looted, with many businesses facing over a year-long recovery.While the loss to the economy was expected to be at least $28 million (24.7 million euros), with the bank's governor warning that the nation's accounts -- already struggling to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic -- had been further weakened by the riots.A more thorough estimate of the damage would be released in the coming days, he added."Now the PM needs to step down," a self-employed 32-year-old who gave his name as Selson told AFP. "That's the demand for all citizens of the Solomon Islands."Local police said a forensic team was working to identify the charred remains of three bodies found in a shop in the city's burnt-out Chinatown district.Heavily armed police were a visible presence on nearby streets as locals began clean up operations and limited bus services resumed.A night-time curfew and the presence of roughly 150 foreign peacekeepers from Australia and Papua New Guinea appeared to have helped cool tensions.But the scale of the recovery was coming into sharp focus, even as the city remained on edge."It is very frustrating as it took me more than three hours to reach the fuel pump to get my vehicle fuelled," Awao told AFP.Hungry mobsMany Solomon Islanders believe their government is corrupt and beholden to Beijing and other foreign interests."Most people are barely getting one meal a day, there are no tourists and very little economic stimulus," Douglas Kelson, chief officer at St John Ambulance Service, told AFP."People do things they normally wouldn't when they are hungry," Kelson said.Protesters channelled their anger directly at Sogavare and his government, with mobs attempting to torch parliament and the prime minister's private residence as police fired tear gas and warning shots.Over 100 people have been arrested for riot-related activity, Solomon Islands police said Saturday as they tried to restore order."No one is above the law," said commissioner Mostyn Mangau, urging residents to "respect each other, as well as our visiting friends from abroad".'Brought to its knees'As tensions escalated, Sogavare had begged neighbours for urgent help.In a letter obtained by AFP, the prime minister told his Papua New Guinea counterpart James Marape that "certain elements" had "attempted to overthrow a democratically elected government" and called for peacekeepers to be sent for a "period of three to four weeks".In an address to the nation, Sogavare told citizens the Solomons had been "brought to its knees" by the rioting but vowed to resist calls for his resignation.But the political situation remained fraught. Opposition leaders on Saturday called for a vote of no confidence in Sogavare's leadership.They may not yet have enough votes to pass the motion and remove Sogavare from office, but the move could produce another flashpoint.The pro-Beijing leader claimed foreign powers opposed to his 2019 decision to switch the Solomons' diplomatic allegiance from Taiwan to China were behind the disturbances.But others pointed to inter-island tensions and widespread joblessness among the country's population -- 40 percent of whom are under 14 years of age.The archipelago nation has for decades endured ethnic and political tensions.Residents of the populous Malaita province have long complained that their island is neglected by the central government, and divisions intensified when Sogavare recognised Beijing.China's government on Friday condemned the violence and vowed to "safeguard the safety and legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens and institutions".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/calm-returns-to-solomons-capital-after-deadly-riots-101638047945961.html
28-11-2021||World||Japan's Kishida vows to counter China, North Korea threats||Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, at his first troop review Saturday, renewed his pledge to consider “all options,” including acquiring enemy base strike capability, and vowed to create a stronger Self-Defense Force to protect the country amid growing threats from China and North Korea.Kishida said the security situation around Japan is rapidly changing and that “the reality is severer than ever,” with North Korea continuing to test-fire ballistic missiles while advancing its capability, and China pursuing a military buildup and increasingly assertive activity in the region.“I will consider all options, including possessing so-called enemy base strike capability, to pursue strengthening of defense power that is necessary,” Kishida said in an address to hundreds of Ground Self-Defense Force members in olive-colored helmets and uniforms.Kishida, who took office in October, served as top commander for the first time at Saturday's Self-Defense Force troop review held at the main army base Camp Asaka, north of Tokyo. About 800 troops gathered for the inspection, according to the Defense Ministry.“The security environment surrounding Japan has been rapidly changing at an unprecedented speed. Things that used to happen only in science-fiction novels are today's reality,” Kishida said. He said his government will lead “calm and realistic” discussions to determine what is needed to protect people's lives and gain their understanding.The possibility of possessing so-called enemy base strike capability has been a divisive issue because opponents say it violates Japan’s war-renouncing Constitution.Kishida has shifted his dovish stance to a more hawkish one, apparently to please influential leaders within his governing party, including former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, and to strengthen his grip on power. He now advocates increasing Japanese military capability and spending.On Friday, Kishida's Cabinet approved a 770 billion yen ($6.8 billion) request for an extra defense budget through March to expedite the purchase of missiles, anti-submarine rockets and other weapons amid rising concern over the escalation of military activities by China, Russia and North Korea.The request, still pending parliamentary approval, is a record for an extra defense budget and will bring Japan’s military spending for the current year to a new high of more than 6.1 trillion yen ($53.2 billion), up 15% from 5.31 trillion yen in 2020. The combined budget for 2021 will be just over 1% of Japan’s GDP, keeping its customary cap.Kishida has said he is open to doubling Japan’s military spending to cope with the worsening security environment. Critics also say Japan, as the world’s fastest-aging country with a shrinking population, should allocate more money toward health care and other services.Compared to past troop reviews, which included 4,000 soldiers, more than 200 vehicles and dozens of warplanes, Saturday’s event was significantly scaled down to minimize the impact on regular troop activity, officials said. There was no parade or public viewing, and only nine tanks and other vehicles participated in the online event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japans-kishida-vows-to-counter-china-north-korea-threats-101638046920652.html
28-11-2021||World||At least 3 people die in winter storm in UK||At least three people have died in the UK after the year's first winter storm battered parts of the countries with gusts of nearly 100 mph (160 kph).The storm, which was named Arwen by the country's Met Office, hit parts of the north of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland particularly hard late Friday and early Saturday. Three men — one in each of those parts of the UK — died as trees were blown over.The storm, which also caused road closures, train delays, power cuts and high waves, abated Saturday.“Storm Arwen has delivered some dangerously strong winds overnight, with gusts in excess of 90 mph recorded," the Met Office's chief meteorologist Steve Ramsdale said. “The strong winds will move south across the UK through the day, gradually weakening."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-least-3-people-die-in-winter-storm-in-uk-101638042319055.html
