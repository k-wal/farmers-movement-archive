Khan conveyed his country’s position on the matter to the Taliban’s acting foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, during a meeting in Islamabad, according to tweets from the official account of the prime minister’s office. The development came a day after India emphasised the urgent need to provide humanitarian aid to the Afghan people and acknowledged, without directly naming Pakistan that efforts in this regard are being held up by the lack of unhindered access. India’s efforts to provide relief materials to the Afghan people in recent weeks, including an offer to supply 50,000 tonnes of wheat, have been held up by Pakistan’s refusal to allow the use of its territory for transporting the aid. “The Prime Minister conveyed that in the current context Pakistan would favourably consider the request by Afghan brothers for transportation of wheat offered by India through Pakistan on exceptional basis for humanitarian purposes and as per modalities to be worked out,” said a tweet from the Pakistani prime minister’s office. Khan told Muttaqi and his delegation that Pakistan had consistently called for the provision of immediate humanitarian relief for Afghanistan. He reiterated “Pakistan’s resolve to stand by the Afghan people by extending all possible support including humanitarian assistance-in-kind to withstand the coming winter season”. Pakistan will provide essential food items, including wheat and rice, emergency medical supplies, and shelter items to Afghanistan, he said. Khan also “underscored the urgent need to release Afghanistan’s frozen assets and facilitation of banking transactions to prevent an economic meltdown”. He conveyed Pakistan’s support to Afghanistan and its people in overcoming the dire challenges faced by the country. He stressed the importance of a “peaceful, stable, sovereign, prosperous and connected Afghanistan for Pakistan and the region”. He said that “continued security and resolute counter-terrorism actions, respect for rights of all Afghans, and inclusivity in governance and politics would further contribute to Afghanistan’s stability”. He also hoped the Taliban setup in Kabul “will continue to constructively engage the international community and will keep on taking positive measures to address the prevailing challenges”. On Thursday, Pakistan hosted a meeting of the “extended troika” that was attended by special envoys of China, Russia and the US to discuss the situation in Afghanistan. The members of the extended troika also met Muttaqi and his delegation on the sidelines of the meeting. According to a joint statement issued after the meeting of the extended troika, the members of the group expressed concern at the severe humanitarian and economic situation in Afghanistan, and called for arrangements for commercial air traffic in order to enable the uninterrupted flow of humanitarian aid. The extended troika also called on the Taliban to take steps to form an inclusive and representative government that respects the rights of all Afghans and provides for equal rights of women and girls. The group agreed to continue “practical engagement” with the Taliban to encourage moderate and prudent policies to achieve a stable and prosperous Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-to-mull-transportation-of-indian-wheat-to-afghanistan-says-pm-imran-khan-101636740766386.html
12-11-2021||World||UK imposes export bar on gold ornament from Tipu Sultan throne||A gold jewelled tiger head, which once belonged to the gold-covered throne of Mysore ruler Tipu Sultan in 18th century India, was on Friday placed under a temporary export bar in an attempt to find a UK buyer for it.The finial, or a crowning ornament, is worth around GBP 1.5 million and the export bar placed by the British government is used to allow time for a UK gallery or institution to acquire the piece of historic value.The finial is one of eight gold tiger heads that adorned the throne of the ruler, famously known as the "Tiger of Mysore".“This fascinating finial illustrates the story of Tipu Sultan’s reign and leads us to examine our imperial history,” said UK Arts Minister Lord Stephen Parkinson.“I hope a UK-based buyer comes forward so that we can all continue to learn more about this important period in our shared history with India,” he said.The finial, made of gold and set with rubies, diamonds and emeralds, is described as a rare example of fully documented 18th century South Indian goldsmiths’ work and its existence was unknown until 2009.Its marble pedestal is unique among the five surviving finials known, and the meaning of its gold inscription is still a mystery.The decision on the export licence application for the finial has been deferred until February 11, 2022, which may be extended until 11 June 2022 if a serious intention to raise funds to purchase it is made at the recommended price of GBP 1.5 million.The minister's decision follows the advice of the Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art and Objects of Cultural Interest (RCEWA), which agreed that it is an important symbolic object in Anglo-Indian history in the last years of the 18th century."Tipu Sultan's golden and bejewelled throne (c.1787-93) was broken up by the British army's Prize Agents after Tipu's defeat and death in defence of his capital, Seringapatam, in 1799. This tiger's head is one of the original eight which were placed on the balustrade of the octagonal throne," said RCEWA Member Christopher Rowell."This tiger's head, one of four throne finials to survive, including a head in the Clive Museum at Powis Castle (NT), should remain in the country together with the other fragments of the throne, and I hope that every effort will be made to achieve this,” he said.Rowell explained that each gold tiger's head from the railing is slightly differently set with gemstones, which makes this example both part of a set and unique in its design.Its quality attests to the expertise of Tipu Sultan's goldsmiths and jewellers, in whose productions he took a close personal interest.The head of the large gold rock crystal tiger which supported the throne, and a bejewelled huma bird which perched on the pinnacle of its canopy, were presented to Britain's George III and Queen Charlotte.“The tiger and its stripes were Tipu Sultan’s personal symbols. ‘Better to live one day as a tiger than 1,000 years as a sheep’ he famously declared. His flirtation with Napoleonic France led to his downfall at British hands,” added Rowell.Tipu Sultan was regarded as the greatest threat to the British East India Company until his defeat and death in 1799.As ruler of Mysore, Tipu identified himself and his personal possessions with tiger imagery and experts believe this finial offers scholars the opportunity to illustrate the vibrant culture of Tipu Sultan’s court and closely examine British imperial history.Three surviving contemporary images of the throne are all in the UK.Tipu's defeat had great historical significance to Britain’s imperial past, leading to a contemporary fascination with Tipu’s story and objects.Following his defeat, many objects from Tipu’s treasury arrived in Britain, where they influenced poetry (John Keats), fiction (Charles Dickens; Wilkie Collins), artists (J.M.W.Turner) and attracted much public interest.The RCEWA made its recommendation to ministers on the grounds that the finial’s departure from the UK would be a “misfortune” because it is so closely connected with UK history and national life and is of outstanding significance for the study of royal propaganda and 18th-century Anglo-Indian history.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-imposes-export-bar-on-gold-ornament-from-tipu-sultan-throne-101636736136186.html
12-11-2021||World||New York welcomes back tourists after 20 months as US reopens travel||New York is welcoming back visitors with open arms after the US ended its 20-month Covid travel restrictions, but it will likely take several years before the number of tourists to the Big Apple reaches pre-pandemic levels.The economic and cultural powerhouse of Manhattan is already feeling busier since the United States lifted its ban on "non-essential" travel on November 8, with Europeans among the early returnees.Eglantine Lasserre, a 40-year-old from Bordeaux, was on the first flight to NYC out of France on Monday."New York has always been a dream of mine, so when I heard about the reopening of the borders I jumped at the opportunity," she told AFP beneath the giant electronic billboards of Times Square.French couple Alexis Maynier, 33 and his wife Camille also decided to make their first trip to New York this week.On a piercing blue-sky fall day, they enjoyed the freedom of meandering around Broadway, 5th Avenue and Central Park."We were under a lot of constraints and now we want to go back to more normal activities," said Maynier, referring to the nearly two years of various pandemic restrictions in France."We want to enjoy and not think too much about these concerns," he added.The ban, first imposed by ex-president Donald Trump in March 2020, impacted foreign visitors from about 30 countries, including those in the European Schengen area, Britain, China, India and Russia.Visitors can now travel to the US provided they are fully vaccinated, a landmark moment in New York's bid to recover economically from the pandemic.The city welcomed almost 67 million tourists in 2019. They brought in $70 billion and more than 400,000 jobs, according to Chris Heywood, executive vice president of NYC & Company, the city's tourism board."Tourism is an economic engine of our city. It's really the lifeblood of this economy," he told AFP.With 8.5 million foreign tourists expected to visit New York in 2022, he recognizes it is "going to take a few years for us to fully be back," in the global tourism competition against Paris, London and Rome.'It feels good'"We're expecting by the end of 2024 to be back to the levels that we were in 2019," said Heywood.The diverse metropolis of 8.5 million people spanning the five boroughs of Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and Staten Island has already come along way.In spring 2020, the city was unrecognizable.Manhattan's normally choked roads and sidewalks were deserted, resembling the science fiction movie "Vanilla Sky," as residents self-confined at home, only venturing out for essential food supplies.Hospital and funeral services were overwhelmed by the crisis that has killed more than 34,000 New Yorkers.Slowly the city has come back to life: Broadway is in full flow again and restaurants and bars are busy. Many workers have yet to return to offices though, leaving business districts still feeling quieter than before Covid-19.New York requires proof of vaccination to enter museums, theatres, cinemas and restaurants, providing a sense of comfort for residents and visitors."We feel completely safe and we even tend to forget everything we've been through, and it feels good," said Lasserre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-welcomes-back-tourists-after-20-months-as-us-reopens-travel-101636736941751.html
12-11-2021||World||Biden, Xi set virtual summit for Monday to discuss tensions||President Joe Biden and China's Xi Jinping will hold their much-anticipated virtual summit on Monday evening as the two sides look to dial back tensions after a rough start to the US-China relationship since Biden took office earlier this year.The White House is setting low expectations for the video call between the leaders.Biden looks to stress that the two nations need to set guardrails in deepening areas of conflict in the increasingly complicated relationship between the two nations. White House officials said that no major announcements are expected to come from the meeting.“The two leaders will discuss ways to responsibly manage the competition between the United States and the PRC, as well as ways to work together where our interests align," White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement announcing the timing of the summit, referring to the People's Republic of China.“Throughout, President Biden will make clear US intentions and priorities and be clear and candid about our concerns."The meeting will be the third engagement between the two leaders since February. It comes after the US and China this week pledged at UN climate talks in Glasgow, Scotland to increase their cooperation and speed up action to rein in climate-damaging emissions.White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan and senior Chinese foreign policy adviser Yang Jiechi came to an agreement on holding the Biden-Xi virtual summit by year's end when they met last month for talks in Zurich but the two sides had not settled on a date.The virtual meeting was proposed after Biden, who spent a substantial amount of time with Xi when the two were vice presidents, mentioned during a September phone call with the Chinese leader that he would like to be able to see Xi again, according to the White House.Xi has not left China during the coronavirus pandemic. White House officials proposed a virtual summit as the best available substitute for the two leaders to have a substantive conversation on a number of issues that have put strains on the U.S.-China relationship.“We hope the U.S. will work together with China to jointly strive to make the leaders' summit a success and bring China-U.S. ties back to the right track of sound and stable development,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said Friday.There has been no shortage of tension in the relationship in recent months as Biden has made clear he sees Beijing's actions on a number of fronts as concerning.The president has criticized China for human rights abuses against ethnic minorities in northwest China, squelching pro-democracy efforts in Hong Kong, and resisting global pressure to cooperate fully with investigations into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic. Tensions have also been exacerbated recently by the Chinese military's flying dozens of sorties near the self-ruled island of Taiwan, which Beijing considers part of its territory.Biden, at the Group of 20 meeting in Rome and again at the U.N. climate gathering, criticized Xi for failing to show up to the summits, where world leaders discussed the way forward on the pandemic and steps to ease the impact of climate change."I think it's been a big mistake, quite frankly, for China ... not showing up, “ Biden said in Glasgow. ”The rest of the world is going to look to China and say, what value added have they provided?"Both leaders took part in Friday's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) virtual meeting, where leaders discussed efforts to end the COVID-19 pandemic and support the global economic recovery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bidenxi-set-virtual-summit-for-monday-to-discuss-tensions-101636737605208.html
12-11-2021||World||1 million Afghan children at risk of dying by year-end amid food crisis: WHO||As conditions in Afghanistan continue to worsen in the aftermath of Taliban recapturing the nation following the pullout of the United States and other foreign forces, the World Health Organisation (WHO) on Friday said that at least one million children in the war-ravaged nation are at the risk of dying by the end of the year as temperatures drop.According to a Reuters report, the United Nations (UN) health agency said that nearly 3.2 million children are likely to suffer from acute malnutrition in Afghanistan by the end of 2021 of whom one million are at the risk of losing their lives.“It’s an uphill battle as starvation grips the country,” WHO spokesperson Margaret Harris said stressing that the international community “must not and cannot afford” to turn its back to Afghanistan.Speaking from Kabul, Harris said temperatures at night have begun dipping below zero degrees Celsius and the young are expected to become susceptible to ailments in colder temperatures.The Reuters report said the WHO spokesperson did not have exact figures on the number of children who have already succumbed to the difficult conditions, but Harris spoke about “wards filled with tiny little children”.Measles cases have been witnessing a spike in Afghanistan, with WHO data showing as many as 24,000 clinical cases had so far been reported.Food crisis has been a major challenge in Afghanistan since the Sunni Pashtun group swept into power on August 15, with a recent report mentioning that Afghans are selling their children to procure food items for survival. Released by the Canada-based think-tank International Forum for Rights and Security (IFFRAS), the report added that 95 per cent of Afghans lack access to adequate food, while half of the country’s population are expected to face acute hunger levels as winter sets in. The prediction by the WHO and IFFRAS come at a time when the Taliban government in Afghanistan is calling for unfreezing its government’s reserves and loans.The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the Global Fund have said they have paid $8million for 23,500 health workers in as many as 31 provinces in Afghanistan over the previous month.“Global Fund took the financial risk; we took the implementation risk to make these payments happen,” UNDP’s regional director for Asia and the Pacific, Kanni Wignaraja said.Last month, the European Union (EU) during its first face-to-face talks with the Sunni Pashtun group, pledged one billion euros ($1.2 billion) in aid for Afghanistan. However, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen clarified that the assistance was “direct support” for Afghans and would be given to international organisations working for the cause on the ground, and not to the ruling Taliban regime.The EU does not recognise the Taliban dispensation in Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/1-million-afghan-children-at-risk-of-dying-by-year-end-amid-food-crisis-who-101636737033919.html
12-11-2021||World||Blinken says Qatar to act as US diplomatic representative in Afghanistan||The United States and Qatar signed an accord on Friday for Qatar to represent US diplomatic interests in Afghanistan, an important signal of possible future direct engagement between Washington and the Taliban after two decades of war.US secretary of state Antony Blinken and his Qatari counterpart, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani, signed the agreement making Qatar the US "protecting power" in Afghanistan at a State Department ceremony after holding talks."Qatar will establish a US interest section within its embassy in Afghanistan to provide certain consular services and monitor the condition and security of US diplomatic facilities in Afghanistan," Blinken said.The move will further strengthen relations between Washington and the small, wealthy Gulf monarchy, which forged close ties with the Taliban by hosting the militants' only official office outside Afghanistan and by playing a key role in the talks that led to the 2020 deal for the US troop pullout this year.The agreement comes as the United States and other Western countries grapple with how to engage with the hardline Islamists after they took over Afghanistan in a lightning advance in August as US-led forces were completing their pullout.The United States and other Western countries shut their embassies and withdrew their diplomats as the Taliban seized Kabul, following which the militants declared an interim government whose top members are under US and UN sanctions.The United States, European countries and others are reluctant to formally recognize the Pashtun-dominated Taliban, accusing them of backtracking on pledges of political and ethnic inclusivity and to uphold the rights of women and minorities.But with winter approaching, many governments realize they need to engage more to prevent the deeply impoverished country from plunging into a humanitarian catastrophe.According to the new agreement, which comes into effect on December 31, Qatar will dedicate certain staff from its embassy in Afghanistan to a US Interests Section and will coordinate closely with US State Department and with US mission in Doha.A senior State Department official said the United States would also continue its engagement with the Taliban's political office in the Qatari capital, Doha.Consular assistance may include accepting passport applications, offering notarial services for documentation, providing information, and helping in emergencies, the US official said on condition of anonymity."The protecting power arrangement envisions that Qatar would facilitate any formal communication between the United States and Afghanistan," the senior US official said.Second AgreementMillions of Afghans face growing hunger amid soaring food prices, a drought and an economy in freefall, fueled by a hard cash shortage, sanctions on Taliban leaders and the suspension of financial aid.The Taliban victory saw the billions of dollars in foreign aid that had kept the economy afloat abruptly switched off, with more than $9 billion in central bank reserves frozen outside the country.In a second agreement with Washington, Qatar will continue to temporarily host up to 8,000 at-risk Afghans who have applied for special immigrant visas (SIV) and their eligible family members, the US official said."SIV applicants will be housed at Camp As Sayliyah and al-Udeid Air Base," the official said.At a press conference after signing the accords, Blinken praised Qatar for aiding ongoing evacuations of American citizens, green cards holders and SIV applicants.Qatar, he said, allowed to transit through Doha roughly half of the 124,000 people evacuated from Afghanistan since August in the hastily arranged and chaotic US evacuation operation.Since then, Qatar has funded at least 15 evacuation flights by Qatar Airways of hundreds of US citizens and others and will continue providing charter flights for SIV holders and other Afghans, he said.Tens of thousands of Afghans potentially at risk of Taliban retribution for aiding the United States and its allies or working for foreign organizations remain in Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/blinken-says-qatar-to-act-as-us-diplomatic-representative-in-afghanistan-101636736165795.html

Assange and Moris, a South Africa-born lawyer, have two young sons: Gabriel, 4, and Max, 2.“I am relieved that reason prevailed, and I hope there will be no further interference with our marriage,” Moris said.In January, a judge refused a US request to extradite Assange, but he remains in prison while a higher court considers the US government's appeal.Assange and Moris made their relationship public in April 2020 and had applied to prison authorities for permission to wed.They threatened legal action against the prison governor and Justice Secretary Dominic Raab, accusing them of trying to prevent the marriage from taking place.“Mr. Assange’s application was received, considered and processed in the usual way by the prison governor, as for any other prisoner,” the Prison Service said Thursday.No date has yet been set for the wedding.US prosecutors have indicted Assange on 17 espionage charges and one charge of computer misuse over WikiLeaks’ publication of thousands of leaked military and diplomatic documents a decade ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/julian-assange-given-permission-to-marry-partner-stella-moris-in-prison-101636718552078.html
12-11-2021||World||Singapore to review time frame for fully vaccinated status against Covid||Singapore's health ministry said on Friday that the regulators will review a time frame on validity of fully vaccinated persons on Covid-19 which is according to the regulations of 365 plus 14 days after the second dose.While enacting Covid-19 regulations earlier this year, regulators indicated an interim time frame of 365 days for a person’s “fully vaccinated” status to remain valid so that vaccination-differentiated safety measures could be implemented, the ministry said."As more data becomes available, including on the increase in protection provided by booster doses, the Expert Committee on Covid-19 Vaccination will study the evidence and make its recommendations to MOH," the Channel News Asia quoted the Ministry of Health (MOH) as saying.Local media reports have highlighted that law the states that a person's fully vaccinated status expires 365 plus 14 days after the second dose. A newspaper reader, in a letter to The Straits Times on Wednesday, had combed through the Infectious Diseases (Mass Gathering Testing for Coronavirus Disease 2019) Regulations 2021.A person is considered fully vaccinated 14 days after the second dose.The reader has asked whether this meant that the government intends for all Singapore residents to take booster shots to be considered fully vaccinated after a year, and that when the efficacy of the booster jab diminishes, residents would have to take an additional booster to maintain their fully vaccinated status.Another question was that when the efficacy of the booster vaccine diminishes, would residents have to take another booster to maintain their fully vaccinated status.In its response, the ministry said it regularly reviews the evidence from studies in Singapore and abroad on the protection provided by the Covid-19 vaccines.“As these studies are ongoing, when enacting the regulations earlier, we had in the interim specified a duration of 365 days... to allow persons who have completed the primary series of their vaccinations to be exempted from vaccination-differentiated safe management measures,” TODAY newspaper quoted the ministry as saying.Exemption from these measures mean that fully vaccinated individuals are allowed to dine in at food and beverage establishments and enter malls and large standalone stores, while those who are unvaccinated cannot.As more data becomes available, including on the increase in protection provided by booster doses, the Expert Committee on Covid-19 Vaccination (EC19V) will study the evidence and make its recommendations and the Ministry will review the stipulated time frame.Both (mRNA) Covid-19 vaccines and non-mRna vaccines approved here are subject to the interim 365-day validity date under the law.The ministry said that while two doses of the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) Covid-19 vaccines provide excellent protection against severe disease, there will be “waning protection against infection”.“Hence MOH (the Ministry of Health) recommends all eligible vaccinated persons to receive their booster doses to improve their protection against Covid-19 infection and reduce transmission,” the ministry said.In Singapore, the Covid-19 vaccines were rolled out in late December last year, with healthcare workers being the first to receive them. They were then progressively given to more frontline workers and then to the elderly in January this year, before being offered to other groups.Meanwhile, the Singapore Prison Service (SPS) said 169 inmates across all prison facilities were Covid-19 positive as of November 10.Indian-origin Malaysian drug trafficker Nagaenthran K Dharmalingam, who is facing execution, was granted a stay of his execution by a three-judge Court of Appeal after he tested positive for Covid-19.Also, five lions have tested positive for COVID-19 at the Singapore zoo.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-to-review-time-frame-for-fully-vaccinated-status-against-covid-101636713048696.html
12-11-2021||World||Film festival in Canada honours filmmaker Ali Kazimi with retrospective||An Indo-Canadian filmmaker has been honoured with a retrospective at Canada’s largest film festival dedicated to Asian cinema.Toronto-based Ali Kazimi is being featured as the Canadian Artist Spotlight for the 25th anniversary edition of the Reel Asian International Film Festival, which showcases cinema from Asia and from the Asian diaspora.The 10-day film festival, which began on Thursday, is screening three of Ali Kazimi’s documentaries including Continuous Journey, which focuses upon the infamous Komagata Maru incident when the ship of that name, carrying 376 passengers from India, was denied landing in Vancouver due to a colonial regulation that disallowed those who had not arrived directly from their boarding point. Also part of the package is Shooting Indians, a portrait of self-described urban Iroquois photographer Jeffrey Thomas and Random Acts of Legacy, which documents life of a Chinese family in Chicago between 1936 and 1951 through the lens of race using footage from their home movies.Kazimi said he felt “truly honoured” at being chosen for the retrospective, particularly since he had never had such a special presentation of his films in Canada. And the location of the film festival being Toronto, where he lives, made it a “wonderful” experience. Retrospectives of his films have previously taken place at the Mumbai International Film Festival and the Pacific Film Archives/Berkeley Art Museum. But being in Toronto was special. “It’s important to have a platform to bring my body of work in a cohesive manner,” said Ali Kazimi. His films have also featured at major film festivals including the Toronto International Film Festival and Hot Docs, North America’s largest documentary festival.Ali Kazimi, 60, was born in Hyderabad, grew up in New Delhi, and moved to Canada in 1983. Over the past two decades he has also taught film and mentored filmmakers, as an Associate Professor at the Department of Cinema and Media Arts at York University in Toronto.He also received the Canadian Governor General’s Award for Lifetime Achievement in Visual and Media Arts in 2019.Kazimi’s career has been marked with serendipitous discoveries of footage, some leading to projects. As he said, “My films find me rather than the other way around. It’s never been an easy process, but it’s been very rewarding.” The Reel Asian accolade is just the latest of those rewards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/film-festival-in-canada-honours-filmmaker-ali-kazimi-with-retrospective-101636712563912.html
12-11-2021||World||At least 3 killed in blast at mosque in Afghanistan's Nangarhar province||At least three people were killed and 15 wounded Friday by a blast at a mosque in Afghanistan's restive Nangarhar province, a hospital official told AFP.The blast happened in Spin Ghar district of the eastern province, a hotbed of Islamic State group activity since the Taliban seized power in the country in August."I can confirm a blast during Friday prayers inside a mosque in Spin Ghar district. There are casualties and fatalities," a Taliban official told AFP."So far three killed, 15 wounded," a doctor at the local hospital told AFP.The Afghan branch of the Islamic State group, which first emerged in Nangarhar in 2015, has claimed responsibility for a series of bloody attacks in Afghanistan since the Taliban's return to power.One of the latest, in early November, saw IS fighters raid the Kabul National Military Hospital, killing at least 19 people and injuring more than 50.More than 120 people were killed in IS attacks earlier this year on two mosques popular with the ethnic minority Hazara community.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/blast-at-mosque-in-afghanistan-s-nangarhar-province-taliban-official-101636711703983.html
12-11-2021||World||China’s Communist Party hails Xi Jinping as ‘helmsman’||President Xi Jinping is the country’s “helmsman” whose “core leadership” is of crucial importance for China’s rejuvenation, an official from the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) said on Friday.“By resolutely upholding Xi Jinping’s core position on the Central Committee and in the Party as a whole, the Chinese people now have a backbone and the huge ship named ‘the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation’ has a helmsman,” said Jiang Jinquan, an official from CPC central committee’s policy research office.A key CPC conclave on Thursday adopted a “historical resolution” that highlighted its achievements under Xi’s leadership since 2012 and elevated the Chinese leader’s stature, cementing his power ahead of next year’s once-in-decade party congress.The CPC further explained the importance of the four-day plenum and Xi’s role at a press conference on Friday.By defining the guiding role of ‘Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era’, Jiang said, “the CPC will be able to stick to the right direction and deal with risks and challenges so as to lead the people to continuously strive for the bright prospects of great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation”.The term “helmsman” was once reserved for the founder of modern China, Mao Zedong.However, it is now used to describe Xi, to emphasise his importance in the current Chinese political and social framework.It was used, for example, in 2020, at the end of a similar four-day CPC plenum in Beijing.A communique issued after the 2020 plenum noted, “Experience has repeatedly indicated that with comrade Xi Jinping as the core of the “central party authorities” and with the core of the party being the “navigator and helmsman”. “We can definitely win over various difficulties and impediments on the road ahead,” it said.On Thursday, the central committee of China’s ruling party declared Xi’s ideology the “essence of Chinese culture”, adding it was “of decisive significance” for “the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation”.Xi Jinping is widely expected to pursue a third five-year term as party general secretary at the 2022 party congress.“The resolution is a guiding piece of literature of Marxism, a political declaration the CPC members made to bear in mind the party’s founding mission and uphold and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics, as well as an action guide for achieving the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation,” said Qu Qingshan, head of the institute of party history and literature of the CPC central committee .At Friday’s press conference, the CPC members also took the opportunity to criticise the democracy summit announced by US President Joe Biden for next month, calling it a “farce”. It is undemocratic to measure different political systems in the world using “a single ruler” and to look at mankind’s different political civilisations from “a monotonous perspective”, said Jiang.“The democracy summit to be held by the United States is a farce in the face of the growing pile of democratic issues in some Western countries, Jiang said at the press conference, according to state-run China Daily newspaper. Washington’s attempt to divide the world into two or several groups will not succeed, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-communist-party-hails-xi-jinping-as-helmsman-101636709323390.html

Unlike the 1981 resolution under Deng that pointed to mistakes during Mao’s cultural revolution, the 2021 resolution simply refers to the period as one of socialist revolution and construction. The clout of President Xi is quite evident as he is mentioned 17 times in the historical resolution as compared to Mao, who features seven times and economic reformer Deng mere five times.Albeit the resolution passed during the centennial celebration talks about the Communist Party’s goal of turning China into a “great modern socialist country” by 2049, the centennial of the People’s Republic, it is quite evident that President Xi is in a hurry to consolidate China with Taiwan a priority after integration of Hong Kong. The Peoples’ Liberation Army (PLA), which is headed by President Xi, made its intentions quite clear after nearly 56 Chinese fighters and bombers violated the south-western air defence identification zone of Taiwan on October 4. The PLA is already testing its long-range missiles on mock-up targets of American aircraft carriers and destroyers in the Taklamakan desert and the PLA navy is aggressive in the South China Sea and larger Indo-Pacific with its propaganda machinery working at full steam.Chinese Communist Party watchers believe that Beijing will translate the “One China” policy from mere words to reality sooner than later as it sees an opportunity in perceived weak US leadership, fractured European Union and suppliant ASEAN countries. The perception of weak US leadership has been strengthened by the disastrous withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan with rag-tag black turban and sandal-wearing militia getting a carte blanche from Washington in Doha and once a celebrated US ally, Pakistan, cheering the Taliban capture of Kabul.That the US is not the military power which it used to be was evident when White House officials hurriedly added a caveat of no change in American “One China” policy after President Joe Biden publicly announced that theUS would militarily defend Taiwan against China military action. The Biden leadership will further weaken politically if Democrats lose the Congress to Republicans next year and this seems to be the upcoming reality as poll numbers for the President dive.The argument that the AUKUS pact will act as a deterrence to Chinese aggression does not work as it will take at least a decade for Australia to train its crew on nuclear-powered submarines and another to acquire them and that too on highly optimistic estimates. Just like the PLA Navy has realised how tricky is naval aviation, operating nuclear submarines even with conventional weapons is another dimension, which the Australians will also come to know.While China under President Xi will ratchet pressure on Taiwan in the coming months, it is will tighten its grip on the Af-Pak region for its energy security through client state Pakistan. Already there is a talk of China building a $15 billion oil pipeline from Gwadar to Xinjiang to circumvent the comparatively arduous Malacca Straits with the Middle-East crude oil being refined at the Baluchistan port. With the Chinese also looking at laying an optical fibre network to link Pakistani villages on both sides of the CPEC corridor, Beijing will have a vice-like grip on Islamabad and consequently put more pressure on India. Transportation of oil through Gwadar will not only strengthen Chinese energy security but also reduce the global leverage of Malacca and other ingress routes to the South China Sea.Even as China is committed to implementing Comrade Xi Jinping’s new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics, the world is already experiencing the rise of aggressive China with its neighbours feeling the heat. While Beijing seems to be in relentless pursuit of its 2049 goals, its immediate adversaries like Japan are still mulling over junking its pacifist doctrine with Russia still viewing the world through bygone cold war calculus. The clock is already ticking on Taiwan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-prepares-for-third-term-clock-ticks-on-taiwan-101636693589895.html
12-11-2021||World||Myanmar court sentences US journalist to 11 years in jail||A court in military-ruled Myanmar on Friday sentenced detained US journalist Danny Fenster to 11 years in prison after finding him guilty on several charges including incitement for allegedly spreading false or inflammatory information.Fenster, the managing editor of the online magazine Frontier Myanmar, was also found guilty of contacting illegal organizations and violating visa regulations, lawyer Than Zaw Aung said.Fenster has been detained since May. He still faces two additional charges in a different court for allegedly violating the counterterrorism law and a statute covering treason and sedition.Fenster was detained at Yangon International Airport on May 24 as he was about to board a flight to go to the Detroit area in the United States to see his family.He is the only foreign journalist to be convicted of a serious crime since the army seized power in February, ousting the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi.The military-installed government has cracked down hard on press freedom, shutting virtually all critical outlets and arresting about 100 journalists, roughly 30 of whom remain in jail. Some of the closed outlets have continued operating without a license, publishing online as their staff members dodge arrest.The army takeover was met by widespread peaceful protests that were put down with lethal force. The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners has detailed the deaths of more than 1,200 civilians, in addition to about 10,000 arrests. Armed resistance has since spread, and UN experts and others observers fear the incipient insurgency can slide into civil war.Fenster’s next challenge is the two additional charges that his lawyer said Monday had been filed in a different court in Yangon.Than Zaw Aung said one of the new charges comes under a section of the Counterterrorism Act that is punishable by from 10 years to life in prison. The military-installed government has said it would apply the law harshly in cases involving opposition organizations it has deemed to be “terrorist.”The other charge under the penal code is usually referred to as treason or sedition and carries a penalty of seven to 20 years’ imprisonment.The hearings on the original three charges have been held at the court in Yangon’s Insein Prison, where Fenster is jailed. They were closed to the press and the public. Accounts of the proceedings have come from Fenster’s lawyer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-court-sentences-us-journalist-to-11-years-in-jail-101636696590322.html
12-11-2021||World||Unvaccinated people lead Covid 4th wave in Germany: Report||The exponential surge in Covid-19 cases in Germany is mostly led by unvaccinated people, multiple reports have said as the country is reeling under a new wave of the pandemic. According to a report by the New York Times, Covid-19 patients in Germany have tripled in recent weeks. Out of this, nearly half of them are on ventilators and "every single one of them is unvaccinated," it reported.The country on Thursday saw a jump of more than 50,000 cases in a single day for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic in 2020. Cases surged by a record 50,196 and the seven-day incidence rate per 100,000 people climbed to 249.1, according to the latest daily data from the RKI public-health institute. Deaths rose by 235 to a total of 97,198.For Germany, it is unprecedented as it was one of the few countries that managed to keep the virus under control with its widespread testing and treatment.However, with the country battling a political limbo, a combination of factors including the slow rollout of vaccines have led to the surge in daily Covid cases.While many of the unvaccinated are in age groups that are statistically likely to experience less severe cases of Covid-19, they can pass the virus to older people with weaker immune systems, who can then end up in intensive care even with vaccination.On Thursday, the outgoing chancellor Angela Merkel said, people who are still not vaccinated as the fourth wave of the coronavirus pandemic takes hold in Germany must understand they have a duty to the rest of society to protect others.Olaf Scholz, who aims to succeed Merkel early next month, has meanwhile asked the country to be "winter-proofed" against the disease, and it will be mostly up to state governments to decide which measures and restrictions are needed in their region.She also asserted that "Many fewer vaccinated people are affected by the infection than those who haven’t been inoculated."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unvaccinated-people-lead-covid-4th-wave-in-germany-report-101636690003241.html
12-11-2021||World||Hong Kong jails ‘Captain America’ protester, who wielded the superhero's shield||A Hong Kong pro-democracy activist, who was dubbed ‘Captain America 2.0’ for wielding the superhero's shield at protests, was jailed on Thursday for nearly six years under the country's stringent national security law after a court ruled that he chanted a banned slogan and promoted independence from China. The development comes at a time when Hong Kong authorities are multiplying their crackdown on pro-democracy and anti-China protests using the sweeping security law drafted by Beijing to set stark limits on free speech.Ma Chun-man, 31, known locally as Captain America 2.0 for the Marvel character he’d sometimes dressed as while protesting, was sentenced to five years and nine months in prison for incitement to secession. The district court ruled last month that his use of slogans, including “liberate Hong Kong, the revolution of our times” violated the vaguely worded security law. Chun-man, however, had pleaded not guilty to the charges he faced.The judge, while handing down the sentence on Thursday, said it didn't matter whether the accused, Ma Chun-man, had used violence or attacked law and order officers or not. What matters is that the accused had performed the action (chanting the slogan) with an intention to “incite others to secession”, the judge noted.For context, Hong Kong has banned the “liberate” slogan under the China-imposed national security law, despite the chant being reverberated and displayed on flags by tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of protesters in the city in recent years.The sentence for Ma’s non-violent offense is on par with some of the longest verdicts handed down for rioting during the mass anti-government unrest of 2019. A man who joined a stick-wielding mob that attacked protesters and commuters in one suburb was sentenced in July to seven years in prison, while a construction worker who participated in an airport riot where he assaulted a mainland Chinese journalist was jailed in January for 5.5 years. (With inputs from Bloomberg)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-jails-captain-america-protester-who-wielded-the-superhero-s-shield-101636683260267.html

US to give automatic work authorisation permits||The United States has agreed to provide automatic work authorisation permits to the spouses of H-1B visa holders, a decision which will benefit thousands of Indian-American women. The Americal Immigration Lawyers' Association filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of immigrant spouses in which this settlement has been reached by the Department of Homeland Security, PTI reported. "This (H-4 visa holders) is a group that always met the regulatory test for automatic extension of EADs (employment authorisation documents), but the agency previously prohibited them from that benefit and forced them to wait for reauthorisation. People were suffering. They were losing their high-paying jobs for absolutely no legitimate reason causing harm to them and US businesses," Jon Wasden from the association said. "Although this is a giant achievement, the parties' agreement will further result in a massive change in position for the USCIS, which now recognises that L-2 spouses enjoy automatic work authorisation incident to status, meaning these spouses of executive and managers will no longer have to apply for employment authorisation prior to working in the United States," the association said. What this means for IndiaSpouses of H-1B and L-2 visa holders will no longer have to apply for work authorisation and need an employment authorisation document as proof in order to work in the United States.For H-4 spouses who have lawful status and merely need to renew their employment authorisation, they will now enjoy an automatic extension of their authorisation for 180 days after expiration should the agency fail to process their timely-filed applications, the settlement says. Dependents of H-1B visa holders are issued H-4 visas.The lawsuit sought to remove the bottlenecks in the policies that caused many spouses job loss as it may take two years to process the applications for the spouses.As Forbes reported, one of the original plaintiffs in the suit was Divya Jayaraj who came to America as an international student and returned as the spouse of an H-1B visa holder. She worked in the health care sector. “Concurrent with her spouse’s extension, on August 25, 2020, she filed applications to extend her H-4 status on Form I-539 and EAD on Form I-765,” according to the lawsuit which claimed that Divya lost her job "because of agency inaction."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/good-news-for-spouses-of-h-1b-visa-holders-us-to-give-automatic-work-authorisation-permits-101636686711201.html
12-11-2021||World||US Congress report says Pakistan playing ‘active and disruptive’ role in Afghanistan||A US Congress report on Afghanistan has accused Pakistan of playing ‘active, disruptive and destabilising’ role in Afghan affairs, including through what it described as Pakistan's support to the Taliban. “Many observers see the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan as a substantiative triumph for Pakistan, bolstering its influence in Afghanistan, and advancing its decades-long efforts to limit India’s influence there,” the bipartisan Congressional Research Service (CRS) report, prepared by independent subject area experts, further said, adding that despite some ‘favourable’ comments top Pakistani officials, the regime’s power grab in the neighbouring war-torn nation may present challenges and complications for Islamabad.Also Read | Afghanistan: The path aheadThe CRS report, which does not represent the official view of the US Congress and is prepared for lawmakers to make informed decisions on issues of interest, further warned that the United States could find itself ‘isolated’ if countries such as Pakistan, Russia, China, or Washington’s allies like Qatar, move towards greater acceptance of the Taliban. “This would weaken America’s leverage, and give the Taliban greater opportunities to evade or counter US pressure,” it said.Also Read | Humanitarian aid for Afghanistan being held up by lack of unimpeded access: IndiaThe document also warned of a ‘difficult but familiar’ challenge for US lawmakers in the event of acceptance of the current Afghan dispensation. “A less oppositional approach could allow us access to, and perhaps influence over, the group and events in Afghanistan. Engagement with a Taliban government which acts in support of some US interests and against others could compel policymakers to weigh and prioritise those interests, posing a difficult challenge, as it is a government which is neither governing democratically nor protecting human rights,” the report said.Also Read | Taliban minister Muttaqi in Islamabad for talks as Pak hosts meet on AfghanistanAny ‘punitive’ approach by the Joe Biden administration could further worsen the already dire humanitarian conditions in Afghanistan, in addition to creating ‘uncertain’ implications for the Taliban, it also said.The Taliban seized power in Afghanistan for a second time, on August 15, in the backdrop of the withdrawal of American forces which began on May 1. The pull-out, which ended on August 30, a day before a self-imposed deadline to do so, brought to an end America’s near 20-year-long military presence in that country.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-congress-report-says-pakistan-playing-active-and-disruptive-role-in-afghanistan-101636684790347.html
12-11-2021||World||McDonald's CEO faces growing criticism after gun victim text||The CEO of McDonald's is facing increasing criticism and calls for resignation following text messages he sent to Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot where he seemed to blame the deaths of two Black and Latino children killed in gun violence on their parents.McDonald's President and CEO Chris Kempczinski sent texts to Lightfoot in April after meeting with her and referred to shootings that killed two children earlier this year: 7-year-old Jaslyn Adams, a Black girl who was shot in a McDonald's drive-thru lane and 13-year-old Adam Toledo, a Latino boy who was shot by Chicago police."With both, the parents failed those kids which I know is something you can't say. Even harder to fix," Kempczinski wrote.The exchange was made public on social media late last month following a Freedom of Information Act request from Michael Kessler, an American activist living in Canada, who said he was looking into an Oregon police matter and working with Chicago-based transparency group Lucy Parsons Lab.Chicago organisations have been protesting for days, saying the messages were racist, ignorant and out-of-touch. Jaslyn Adams' mother has demanded an apology from the CEO, who is white. And US Rep. Bobby Rush of Illinois called this week for Kempczinski to be removed."This is a deplorable message, and one that is completely unacceptable for the CEO of a powerful multinational corporation — let alone a corporation that markets aggressively to communities of colour and publicly proclaims that Black lives matter' — to espouse," the Chicago Democrat said in a statement Wednesday.A coalition of community groups amplified their demand for Kempczinski to resign Thursday by protesting outside the McDonald's where Jaslyn Adams was killed. The coalition, which called attention to other racial discrimination complaints the company has faced, called on the fast-food giant to create a USD 200 million fund over four years to improve life in Chicago, among other things. The group included immigrant rights activists, labour groups and churches.Earlier this month, Kempczinski sent a note to McDonald's corporate employees in the US, saying he was thinking through his "lens as a parent and reacted viscerally," according to The Chicago Tribune."But I have not walked in the shoes of Adam's or Jaslyn's family and so many others who are facing a very different reality," he said. "Not taking the time to think about this from their viewpoint was wrong, and lacked the empathy and compassion I feel for these families. This is a lesson that I will carry with me."McDonald's has declined to comment to reporters. A message left Thursday for a spokesperson by the Associated Press was not immediately returned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mcdonalds-ceo-faces-growing-criticism-after-gun-victim-text-101636678644913.html
12-11-2021||World||SpaceX capsule with crew of four docks with International Space Station||A SpaceX capsule carrying four astronauts docked with the International Space Station on Thursday, kicking off a six-month stay on the orbiting outpost.This mission known as Crew-3 is part of Nasa's multibillion-dollar partnership with Elon Musk's space company, signed after the Space Shuttle program ended in 2011 and aimed at restoring US capacity to carry out human spaceflight, rather than depend on Russia for links to the ISS.The ISS had been operating with just one Nasa astronaut in the US segment to welcome the incoming crew after the astronauts of the earlier Crew-2 mission splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico on Sunday.Crew-3's Raja Chari, Kayla Barron and Tom Marshburn of the United States and Matthias Maurer of Germany traveled to space aboard a Crew Dragon capsule fixed to a Falcon 9 rocket from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. They blasted off late Wednesday.The spaceship, called Endurance, docked with the ISS around 7:10 pm Thursday (0010 GMT Friday).The flight was initially postponed from October 31, first for weather, then a "minor medical issue" affecting one of the crew. Nasa did not say who it was but said it was not Covid-related.Chari, a US Air Force colonel, is commanding the mission and making his first trip to space, along with Barron and Maurer.Marshburn, a medical doctor, flew aboard a Space Shuttle in 2009 and a Russian Soyuz spacecraft in a mission from 2012-13.Barron, who along with Chari was selected for the Nasa astronaut corps in 2017, the most recent recruitment, previously served as a submarine warfare officer for the Navy, while Maurer, a materials science engineer, is the 12th German to go into space.The quartet will spend six months on the orbital outpost and conduct research to help inform future deep space exploration and benefit life on Earth.Scientific highlights of the mission include an experiment to grow plants in space without soil or other growth media, and another to build optical fibers in microgravity, which prior research has suggested will be superior in quality to those made on Earth.The Crew-3 astronauts will also conduct spacewalks to complete an upgrade of the station's solar panels and will be present for two tourism missions, including Japanese visitors aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft at the end of the year and the Space-X Axiom crew, set for launch in February 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spacex-capsule-with-crew-of-four-docks-with-international-space-station-101636682246249.html
12-11-2021||World||US court grants Trump's request to halt release of White House documents||A US court on Thursday granted former president Donald Trump's request to temporarily halt the release of White House documents that could implicate him in the January 6 attack on the Capitol.The documents have been sought by the House Select Committee investigating the riot and had been ordered released Tuesday by a US district judge.The US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit said Thursday, however, that it had granted what it called an administrative injunction and scheduled arguments for November 30.The three-judge panel specified that the move “should not be construed in any way as a ruling on the merits” of the case.On January 6, hundreds of Trump rampaging supporters overran Congress and delayed a joint session to confirm that Joe Biden had won the November 2020 election and would become president.Biden has already approved the release of the records, which are held by the National Archives. The House panel was to receive its first batch on Friday.Overall the House has requested more than 770 pages of documents including records from Trump's top aides and memos to his press secretary.Among the records are documents from Trump's former chief of staff Mark Meadows, his former senior advisor Stephen Miller and his former deputy counsel Patrick Philbin.Trump had also hoped to block the release of the White House Daily Diary – a record of his activities, trips, briefings, and phone calls.Another trove of documents Trump does not want Congress to see includes memos to his former press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, a handwritten note on the January 6 events, and a draft text of his speech at the “Save America” rally. Delivered just prior to the attack, Trump in that address urged followers to “fight like hell” in defense of his false claim that the election was stolen from him.Earlier this week, the House committee issued subpoenas to top Trump aides who allegedly plotted to overturn his defeat in a “war room” at a luxury Washington hotel as well as for some of his most senior lieutenants, including McEnany and Miller.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-court-grants-trump-s-request-to-halt-release-of-white-house-documents-101636677497950.html
12-11-2021||World||Students from India face lots of challenges in Canada: Experts||As Canada heads towards a record intake of students from India this year, a leading immigration lawyer and charity groups are warning of the challenges these newcomers face on arrival leading to suicides and even prostitution as they come under pressure in a foreign land.According to data from Immigration Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), 156,171 study permits were given to students from India, almost double the number from 2020, which was at 76,149, a substantial drop due to the Covid-19 pandemic and restrictions on travel. However, the surge this year could lead to a new record high in Indian students reaching Canadian universities and colleges, as it’s on course to eclipse the previous mark of 174,687 in 2019.International students overall make for an industry that adds between 7 billion and 8 billion Canadian dollars each year to the Canadian higher education sector, resulting in serious recruitment activity, particularly in states like Punjab. In a recent report tracking that phenomenon and its extreme downside, the Canadian outlet Globe and Mail noted, “Bringing Indian students to Canada has become a lucrative business spanning two continents.”The dark side of these burgeoning numbers is the mental health problems faced by these students, as families take on enormous debt to send their children abroad. The amount charged by education institutions in Canada are usually four times the approximately 7,000 Canadian dollars figure for domestic students. Adding to the burden are expenses for accommodation and food, among other items.The outlet The Pointer reported that a single funeral home in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) recorded five dead bodies of Indian students each month.Ravi Jain, founder of Canadian Immigration Lawyers’ Association, said, “Consultants in India are painting a rosy picture and then there’s a tragic side”.There’s tremendous pressure on these students to recoup the investments by their parents, and often unable to do so, they turn to drugs, leading to overdoses, suicide, and even prostitution.Kamal Bhardwaj, proprietor of the Lotus Funeral and Cremation Centre in Toronto, is seeing this regularly, as he said they are handling corpses of five to six students each month. They are not privy to the cause of death, but some bodies turn up with ligature marks, indicating possible suicide and others bear signs of overdose. “There’s been an increase in the number of young people dying,” he told the Hindustan Times.In fact, that has led him to partner with two others to found a charity serving these students. Called Sunoh, it offers counselling, including for those contemplating suicide. And it organises webinars before the students leave India so as to provide them with a realistic picture of life in Canada and the hardships it entails. A partner organisation recently had half-a-dozen young girls arrive in distress as they were pregnant. Bhardwaj felt this pointed to possible “human trafficking”.Montreal-based physician Shivendra Dwivedi has a similar initiative, called Sahyog, which also offers webinars and mental health counselling. He said, “These poor students are being exploited. It’s a racket. Recruiters are selling them an impossible dream.”He plans to approach Canada’s new Immigration Minister Sean Fraser for initiating urgently required reforms in the system.Jain, who practices with the Toronto-based firm Green & Spiegel and is also former chair of the Canadian Bar Association’s Immigration unit, said this problem is “widespread” and “it’s become more common. The community doesn’t really come out about it too much because there’s a lot of shame and embarrassment and of course the government doesn’t want to publicise it” because of the billions of dollars in revenue involved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/students-from-india-face-lots-of-challenges-in-canada-experts-101636635626516.html
