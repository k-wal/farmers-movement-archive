He also shared the WFP’s plan outlining the breakdown of the amount (6.6 billion USD) that would be spent to save 42 million people from famine.Why is the UN asking $ 6.6 billion?It all started with an interview by Beasley to American news network CNN. “The billionaires need to step up now. On a one-time basis, six billion dollars (USD), to help 42 million people that are literally going to die if we don’t reach them. It’s not complicated,” an animated Beasley told during an interview in ‘Connect the World’ program.This hunger crisis is urgent, unprecedented, AND avoidable. @elonmusk, you asked for a clear plan & open books. Here it is! We're ready to talk with you - and anyone else - who is serious about saving lives. The ask is $6.6B to avert famine in 2022: https://t.co/eJLmfcMVqEHe also said that it was a one-time donation and not something that people need to do “everyday or every week.” He pointed out that the top 400 billionaires in the US saw an increase in net worth of 1.8 trillion USD in the last year and said “All I am asking for is 0.36% of your net worth increase.”But why Musk?Notably, during the interview, Beasly said, “Just last week Elon Musk had a 6-billion-dollars net worth increase in one day.” CNN then reported that the billionaire is worth $289 billion and the WFP is asking for a mere 2% donation.Also read | Nearly 55% of Afghans expected to face food insecurity soon, UN report saysResponding to the article, Musk on October 31 said that he would sell stocks of his popular company Tesla and donate if the WFP can explain its claims.“If WFP can describe on this Twitter thread exactly how $6B will solve world hunger, I will sell Tesla stock right now and do it,” he tweeted. “But it must be open source accounting, so the public sees precisely how the money is spent,” he also said.But it must be open source accounting, so the public sees precisely how the money is spent.WFP’s planMeanwhile, the Beasley on the day said, “This hunger crisis is urgent, unprecedented, AND avoidable. @elonmusk, you asked for a clear plan & open books. Here it is! We're ready to talk with you - and anyone else - who is serious about saving lives. The ask is $6.6B to avert famine in 2022.”So here is the breakup of the amount issued by the WFP. Of the total $3.5 billion would be used for food and delivery which includes the cost of shipping and transport to the destination country, warehousing and last mile delivery that also includes security escorts in conflict zones.Also read | UN official warns of increasing child marriages in Afghanistan, calls for actionFor cash and food vouchers in countries where the markets can function, $2billion has been earmarked by the WFP. While $700 million and $400 million would respectively be used for “country-specific costs to design, scale up and manage the implementation of efficient and effective programmes” and “lobal and regional operations management, administration and accountability.”Only five countries -- Afghanistan, Madagascar, South Sudan, Sudan and Yemen -- account for 20 million people, Beasley highlighted. “They are the frontlines of hunger. What I’ve seen in each of these countries is worse than you can possibly imagine,” he said.Meanwhile, Musk is yet to respond to Beasley’s call for further talks on any of the social media platforms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-food-program-chief-shares-plan-to-spend-6billion-to-end-hunger-after-elon-musk-vowed-to-sell-tesla-stocks-101637084386967.html

China was the first country sanctioned under this law in 2018; followed by Turkey, a Nato ally, in 2020; both over S-400.Trump administration official, specially then defence secretary James Mattis had argued for waiver for India and New Delhi has since, and because of other indications, believed its purchase of S-400 will be exempted from sanctions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-expresses-concern-over-s-400-deliveries-to-india-101637081489281.html

16-11-2021||World||Facebook says Pak hackers targeted Afghan users amid govt collapse: Report||Hackers from Pakistan used Facebook to target people in Afghanistan with connections to the previous government during the Taliban's takeover of the country, the company's threat investigators said in an interview with Reuters.Facebook said the group, known in the security industry as SideCopy, shared links to websites hosting malware that could surveil people's devices. Targets included people connected to the government, military, and law enforcement in Kabul, it said. Facebook said it removed SideCopy from its platform in August.The social media company, which recently changed its name to Meta, said the group created fictitious personas of young women as “romantic lures” to build trust and trick targets into clicking phishing links or downloading malicious chat apps. It also compromised legitimate websites to manipulate people into giving up their Facebook credentials."It's always difficult for us to speculate as to the end goal of the threat actor," Facebook's head of cyber espionage investigations, Mike Dvilyanski, said. "We don't know exactly who was compromised or what the end result of that was."Major online platforms and email providers including Facebook, Twitter Inc, Alphabet Inc's Google, and Microsoft Corp's LinkedIn have said they took steps to lock down Afghan users' accounts during the Taliban's swift takeover of the country this past summer.Facebook said it had not previously disclosed the hacking campaign, which it said ramped up between April and August, due to safety concerns about its employees in the country and the need for more work to investigate the network. It said it shared information with the US state department at the time it took down the operation.Investigators also said Facebook had last month disabled the accounts of two hacking groups which it linked to Syria's Air Force Intelligence.Facebook said one group, known as the Syrian Electronic Army, targeted human rights activists, journalists, and others opposing the ruling regime, while the other targeted people linked to the Free Syrian Army and former military personnel who had joined opposition forces.Facebook's head of global threat disruption, David Agranovich, said the Syria and Afghanistan cases showed cyberespionage groups leveraging periods of uncertainty during conflicts when people might be more susceptible to manipulation.The company said a third hacking network in Syria, which is linked to the Syrian government and removed in October, targeted minority groups, activists, and members of the People's Protection Units (YPG) and Syria Civil Defense, or White Helmets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-says-pak-hackers-targeted-afghan-users-amid-govt-collapse-report-101637072020965.html

US officials said Monday's test had generated a debris field in low-Earth orbit that endangered the International Space Station (ISS) and that would pose a hazard to space activities for years.Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg said the test was reckless, posed a threat to the ISS and an orbiting Chinese spacecraft, and showed Russia was developing new weapons systems. A British government spokesperson condemned the test and urged Moscow to join discussions at the United Nations on "responsible behaviour when it comes to space."Russia's defence ministry said the debris from the test had not posed a threat to the ISS, and that Washington knew this."The Russian Ministry of Defence successfully conducted a test on Nov. 15 that hit the non-operational Russian spacecraft Tselina-D, which had been in orbit since 1982," it said in a statement.It said the United States, China and India had conducted similar tests in the past.Russia, it said, was being forced to beef up its defence capabilities because of what it said were weapons tests by the United States and Washington establishing a space force in 2020.Moscow said it had called for years for an agreement to stop weapons being deployed in space, but that Washington and its allies had blocked the deal at the United Nations.Officials from the US space agency Nasa will seek to discuss anti-satellite weapon testing on Wednesday during a trip to Moscow, Russia's RIA news agency cited Nasa's head as saying on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russias-anti-satellite-weapons-test-draws-critique-from-us-nato-101637067963063.html
16-11-2021||World||Xi Jinping greets Joe Biden as ‘old friend’, warns him against playing with Taiwan fire||Chinese President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Joe Biden on Tuesday talked about avoiding conflict and jointly responding to global challenges like climate change as the two leaders met for more than 200 minutes via video link, the first such meeting since Biden became president in January.Xi greeted Biden as “old friend” at the beginning of the meeting on Tuesday morning (China time), spoke about Beijing and Washington’s responsibility in responding to challenges like climate change and the Covid-19 pandemic but also warned the US against pushing for the independence of the self-ruled democracy, Taiwan, which China claims as its own.‘PLAYING WITH FIRE’Xi described the intention of some people in the US to “use Taiwan to control China” as a dangerous trend. “It is playing with fire, and those who play with fire get burned,” Xi said.“Complete reunification of China is the common aspiration of all sons and daughters of the Chinese nation,” Xi told Biden. “We are patient and willing to do our utmost to strive for the prospect of peaceful reunification with the utmost sincerity,” Xi was quoted as saying by official Chinese media.Xi said China will be compelled to take resolute measures, should the separatist forces for ‘Taiwan independence’, “…provoke us, force our hands or even cross the red line”.On Taiwan, Chinese official media quoted Biden as saying that the US government does not support “Taiwan independence” forces.Biden told Xi that they “need to rebuild the guardrail of consensus, be clear and honest about our differences, and work together on areas of mutual interest, especially on major global issues like climate change”.PRINCIPLE OF MUTUAL BENEFITChinese state media quoted Xi as saying that China and the US are “…two huge ships sailing in the middle of the ocean. We should keep the rudders steady so that the two giant ships can move forward together in the face of wind and waves without drifting, stalling or colliding”.“We should adhere to the principle of mutual benefit and not play a zero-sum game,” Xi said.Xi had met for a “…thorough and in-depth communication and exchanges with US President Joe Biden in a rare long virtual meeting on Tuesday morning during which they discussed strategic and fundamental issues on the development of bilateral relations”, the Global Times said in a report on Tuesday.Chinese observers said “…the meeting will inject certainty into the bilateral ties and is sending a signal that the two countries will cooperate in many areas” despite not being able to avoid “fierce competition” in other areas.The first face-to-face virtual meeting between the top two leaders lasted three hours and 24 minutes.A video released by China’s national broadcaster, CCTV showed Xi saying he was very happy to see his “old friend” and that it was crucial for China and the US to work together in addressing common challenges.PEACEFUL COEXISTENCEChina and the US should respect each other, coexist in peace, and pursue win-win cooperation, Xi told Biden, adding that the two countries need to cooperate to respond to global challenges like climate change and the Covid-19 pandemic.“Xi expressed his readiness to work with President Biden to build consensus and take active steps to move China-US relations forward in a positive direction,” a statement issued by the Xinhua news agency, quoted Xi as saying.“Advancing global peace and development is the “…joint mission of Chinese and American leaders”, Xi said.Xi pointed out that both China and the US are at critical stages of development, and the “global village” of humanity faces multiple challenges.The Chinese President spoke about the need to “increase” communication between the two countries.“As the world’s two largest economies and permanent members of the UN Security Council, China and the US need to increase communication and cooperation, each run their domestic affairs well and, at the same time, shoulder their share of international responsibilities, and work together to advance the noble cause of world peace and development,” Xi told Biden.“This is the shared desire of the people of the two countries and around the world, and the joint mission of Chinese and American leaders,” Xi said.Xi expressed his readiness to work with Biden to build consensus and take active steps to move China-US relations forward in a positive direction.“Doing so will advance the interests of the two peoples and meet the expectation of the international community,” Xi said.On the issue of human rights, Xi said China is willing to conduct dialogue on human rights issues on the basis of mutual respect but is not in favour of using human rights to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries.Xi, according to official media, said the people can judge if a nation is democratic or not, and it’s undemocratic in itself to exclude others only because of their different forms of achieving democracy.Xi was accompanied by some of China’s top politicians and diplomats, according to Chinese state media.Ding Xuexiang, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and director of the General Office of the CPC Central Committee, Chinese vice-premier Liu He, Yang Jiechi, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the CPC Central Committee, Chinese state councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi as well as vice foreign minister Xie Feng were among the attendees to the meeting, according to photo of the video meeting released by Xinhua.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-jinping-greets-joe-biden-as-old-friend-warns-him-against-playing-with-taiwan-fire-101637061568038.html
16-11-2021||World||Son of late Philippine dictator emerges as presidential frontrunner||The son of late Philippines strongman Ferdinand Marcos has emerged as the person to beat in the 2022 presidential race after president Rodrigo Duterte's popular daughter decided not to contest the country's top job.Ferdinand Marcos Jr likely benefited the most from Davao city mayor Sara Duterte-Carpio's move to run for vice president, against the wishes of her supporters, despite leading polls for preferred presidential contenders all throughout the year.“Without the popular Duterte-Carpio in the presidential race, Marcos is the frontrunner, with 60 per cent odds of victory, though there is a long road ahead,” the Eurasia Group consultancy said in a note to clients late on Monday, after nominations closed.While Marcos's candidacy has angered victims of his father's brutal era of martial law, a survey by the Social Weather Station (SWS) in October showed he could easily beat his rivals, including boxing hero Manny Pacquiao.Of the six key candidates confirmed to run for president at the time the poll was conducted, 47 per cent of the 1,200 surveyed by the SWS said they would vote for the 64-year old Marcos, popularly known as “Bongbong” or “BBM”.“The only explanation there is he got the pro-Sara voters. There is a very close affinity between BBM voters and Sara's voters,” said political analyst Temario Rivera.The election to choose a successor to Duterte will be held in May next year. He himself is not eligible to contest for the presidency again after his single six-year term but will be standing in the election for a senator's seat.Marcos is the only son of the late dictator who ruled the Philippines for almost two decades until his 1986 overthrow. He said he wants Duterte-Carpio to be his running mate, but she has yet to accept.Marcos's family is among the country's most famous dynasties and despite its fall from grace, has retained far-reaching and powerful connections.‘Stop-Marcos candidate’Marcos, the dictator, died in exile in 1989 after fleeing the country following the “people power” revolution. Since the family's return, Marcos junior has been elected governor, congressman, and in 2010, as a senator. His sister is a senator and a former governor, and his mother, Imelda Marcos, was elected to Congress for four terms.“In a country whereby political memories are quite short and forgiveness is not in short supply, this is definitely working in favour of the Marcoses,” said Richard Heydarian, an author, columnist and academic who specialises in politics.Working to his advantage, political analysts also say, is Marcos's strong social media presence aimed at targeting the youth, who make up a third of eligible voters. Many of them were not born when Marcos senior was in power.The poll results showed the other presidential candidates far adrift, with incumbent Vice President Leni Robredo with 18 per cent, and Manila mayor Francisco Domagoso on 13 per cent, followed by Pacquiao with 9 per cent.The poll did not include Christopher “Bong” Go, Duterte's closest aide, who only joined the presidential race on Saturday, and analysts say his entry, which is backed by the popular firebrand leader, could dilute some of Marcos' support.Marcos is also facing a disqualification case grounded on a two-decade old tax evasion conviction, which Eurasia said Duterte could “weaponise if he turns against his ally”.The race could narrow too, if Marcos's rivals unite behind a single “stop-Marcos” candidate in the race, Eurasia said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/son-of-late-philippine-dictator-emerges-as-presidential-frontrunner-101637057510749.html

The prize was named after Madanjeet Singh who sponsored the celebrations in the year. In 2000, Singh also became the UN’s goodwill ambassador and contributed immensely to bringing communal harmony among communities.The prize is titled Unesco-Madanjeet Singh Prize for the Promotion of Tolerance and Non-Violence and rewards significant activities in the scientific, artistic, cultural or communication fields aimed at the promotion of a spirit of tolerance and non-violence. It is awarded every two years on November 16.Last time, the Unesco-Madanjeet Singh Prize for the Promotion of Tolerance and Non-Violence was awarded in 2020 to the nongovernmental Centre Résolution Conflits (Centre for Resolution of Conflicts - CRC) in the Democratic Republic of Congo.The international Jury of the Prize recommended the CRC in recognition of its work for the defence of human rights, its "tireless (commitment to the) rescue of child soldiers from militia groups, and their rehabilitation and reintegration into their home communities. (CRC) also brings together communities from different tribes to live together in peace by conducting special training for this purpose," according to Unesco's site.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-is-international-day-for-tolerance-and-why-is-it-observed-101637038428464.html

Violent crimes, such as sexual assault, has occurred at tourist sites and in other locations," it said.The department in its advisory for Pakistan urged US citizens not to travel to Balochistan province and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province, including the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), due to terrorism and kidnapping, and also in the immediate vicinity of the Line of Control due to terrorism and the potential for armed conflict."Terrorist groups continue plotting attacks in Pakistan. A local history of terrorism and ongoing ideological aspirations of violence by extremist elements have led to indiscriminate attacks on civilian as well as local military and police targets," it said."Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting transportation hubs, markets, shopping malls, military installations, airports, universities, tourist locations, schools, hospitals, places of worship, and government facilities," it said.Terrorists have targeted US diplomats and diplomatic facilities in the past, the advisory on Pakistan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-cdc-issues-level-one-covid-19-travel-health-notice-for-india-101637037479443.html

Although it's not as good as a face-to-face meeting, I'm very happy to see my old friend," the Chinese leader said he began speaking after Biden called for more understanding and cooperation between the two to avoid any conflict, in his opening statement.Biden too remembered his relationship with Xi while he was the US vice president under the Obama administration from 2009 to 2017. “We spent an awful lot of time talking to each other… Maybe I should start more formally even though you and I have never been that formal with one another,” the US president said.The summit comes amid the rising tension between the United States and China over a number of issues including trade, the South China Sea, human rights violations in Hong Kong and military aggression against Taiwan, and more. Despite being critical about each other in the past, the meeting on a hopeful note as Biden said that their goal is to ensure competition between the two largest economies, "does not veer into conflict.""It seems to me we need to establish some common-sense guardrails. To be clear and honest where we disagree, and work together where interests intersect, especially on vital global issues like climate change," Biden said as the summit opened.Meanwhile, Xi stressed that sound and steady China-US relations are required for advancing the two countries' respective development. “As the world's two largest economies and the permanent members of the UN Security Council, China and the United States need to increase communication and cooperation," he also said.Xi has not left China for nearly two years and Biden sharply criticised his absence at the recent COP26 climate summit in Glasgow and the G20 summit in Rome.The highly-anticipated summit is the third engagement between Xi, 68, and the 78-year-old US president, since Biden's inauguration in January. In the past, the two leaders have had lengthy discussions over a phone call.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-calls-biden-his-old-friend-as-us-china-talks-begin-on-a-warm-note-101637034069160.html

KCNA said Kim inspected the third and last phase of construction during his visit to the city.“Noting that the 4 year-long construction of Samjiyon City proved the irresistible might of the single-minded unity and harmonious whole of the Party and the people and also the iron will of our state to achieve prosperity our own way and with our own efforts, as well as its self-confidence and possibility of independent development, the General Secretary, in the name of the Party Central Committee, sent thanks to the builders, supporters and the people of the whole nation who brilliantly realized the decisions and policies of the Party,” KCNA said.Also read | North Korea's mechanised troops conduct artillery fire drill“He said that the achievements, experience and standards gained through the construction of Samjiyon City serve as correct guidelines for pushing forward our Party's policy of local construction in the right direction. He added that this has great significance in the on-going struggle for making a new start for the change of local areas,” it added.Samjiyon city is being changed into a massive economic hub, called a "socialist utopia” by officials, and will have new apartments, hotels, a ski resort and commercial, cultural and medical facilities.Also read | North Koreans facing food shortages, collapses in livelihoods: UN investigatorSamjiyon city is near Mount Paektu, the holy mountain where Kim's family claims its roots, and he has made multiple visits since 2018.According to KCNA, the construction at Samjiyon city could be finished by the end of this year, when he will complete a decade in rule since taking power following the death of his father in December 2011.Also read | Kim Jong Un lost 20kg but remains healthy: ReportThe transformation of Samjiyon into a “model cultured city” was one of the main focuses of a nationwide construction campaign that North Korea wanted to finish in time for the 75th anniversary of its ruling party’s founding in October 2020. However, construction was slowed amid the coronavirus pandemic and international sanctions over Kim’s nuclear weapon and missile programs.“Claiming the success of Samjiyon’s development is politically important at this time because the Mount Paekdu region is central to North Korean mythology and the embellished story of the previous leader‘s birth,” Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, told the Associated Press.While KCNA did not give a date for Kim's visit, it is the first report of public activity by the leader for 35 days, his longest absence since 2014.

Xi pointed out that both China and the US are at critical stages of development, and the “global village” of humanity faces multiple challenges.The Chinese President spoke about the need to “increase” communication between the two countries.“As the world’s two largest economies and permanent members of the UN Security Council, China and the US need to increase communication and cooperation, each run their domestic affairs well and, at the same time, shoulder their share of international responsibilities, and work together to advance the noble cause of world peace and development,” Xi told Biden.“This is the shared desire of the people of the two countries and around the world, and the joint mission of Chinese and American leaders,” Xi said.According to the Xinhua statement, Xi expressed his readiness to work with Biden to build consensus and take active steps to move China-US relations forward in a positive direction.“Doing so will advance the interests of the two peoples and meet the expectation of the international community,” Xi said.On the issue of human rights, Xi said China is willing to conduct dialogue on human rights issues on the basis of mutual respect but is not in favour of using human rights to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries.Xi said the people can judge if a nation is democratic or not, and it is undemocratic in itself to exclude others only because of their different forms of achieving democracy, according to Chinese state media.Xi is accompanied by some of China’s top politicians and diplomats, according to Chinese state media.Ding Xuexiang, a member of the political bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and director of the General Office of the CPC Central Committee, Chinese Vice-Premier Liu He, Yang Jiechi, a member of the political bureau of the CPC Central Committee and director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the CPC Central Committee, Chinese state councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi as well as vice foreign minister Xie Feng are among the attendees to the meeting, according to photo of the video meeting released by Xinhua.Chinese state-controlled media said on Monday that Beijing will ask Washington to “step back” on its policies and statements on the self-ruled and democratic island, which China claims as a breakaway region.The situation in Afghanistan, bilateral trade, nuclear proliferation and cybersecurity are likely to be discussed during the talks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/advancing-global-peace-is-china-us-joint-mission-xi-jinping-tells-joe-biden-101637030785659.html

Whoever is responsible for this has shown great disrespect to the Australian-Indian community and should be ashamed," Morrison added.Meanwhile, Australia India Community Charitable Trust chair Vasan Srinivasan said the offenders were trying to cut off the head of the statute by grinding around it. With nearly 300,000 Indians living in Victoria, Srinivasan said it was never expected that such an act could take place.The Australian Indian Community Centre in Rowville is the first such centre of the Indian community in Victoria and was established after three decades of effort, Surya Prakash Soni, president of the Federation of Indian Associations of Victoria, said, according to a report by the ABC.The Victoria Police said that an unknown number of offenders used a tool to decapitate the statue between last Friday and Saturday, the ABC report said, adding the Knox Crime Investigation Unit detectives are probing the matter and have urged witnesses to come forward with any details.In January this year, a statue of Mahatma Gandhi was vandalised in the United States in the Central Park of the City of Davis in Northern California.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mahatma-gandhi-s-statue-vandalised-in-australia-a-day-after-unveiling-101637025619328.html
16-11-2021||World||'Guardrails' needed to prevent US-China ‘conflict': Joe Biden tells Xi in virtual meeting||US President Joe Biden and China's Xi Jinping opened a virtual summit Monday with an appeal for better communication between the superpowers and "guardrails" to avoid conflict.Speaking from the White House to Xi on a television screen, Biden said they must develop "guardrails" to "ensure that the competition between our countries does not veer into conflict, whether intended or unintended."He said they would have a "candid" discussion.Xi, speaking from Beijing, called Biden "my old friend," but said the rivals must work more closely."China and the United States need to increase communication and cooperation," he said.The two leaders have spoken by phone twice since Biden's inauguration in January but with Xi refusing to travel abroad because of the pandemic, an online video meeting was the only option short of an in-person summit.White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Biden was going into the summit, expected to last a couple of hours, "from a position of strength," after months of rebuilding alliances with other democracies to contain China.The meeting is "an opportunity to set the terms of the competition with China" and to insist the leadership in Beijing "play by the rules of the road," Psaki said.Most of the attention in the build-up to the meeting has focused on the sparring over Taiwan, a self-ruling democracy claimed by China. Biden's aides have cast the summit as an opportunity to help prevent tensions from escalating.Biden will "make clear that we want to build common guardrails to avoid miscalculation," a senior US administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told reporters.However, the White House sought to temper expectations, with the official saying that the summit "is not a meeting where we expect deliverables to be coming out."Biden, a veteran of foreign policy issues during his decades in politics, has often said phone conversations are no substitute for face-to-face meetings.Xi has not left China for nearly two years, and Biden sharply criticized his absence at the recent COP26 climate summit in Glasgow and G20 summit in Rome.Biden gets domestic boostRelations between the superpowers plummeted during the presidency of Donald Trump, who launched a trade war with China while assailing Beijing's response to an international probe into the origins of the Covid pandemic in the Chinese city of Wuhan.Biden has recast the confrontation more broadly as a struggle between democracy and autocracy.He got a boost on Monday when he signed into law a $1.2 trillion infrastructure package, the biggest of its kind in more than half a century. Biden describes the initiative as an important step in catching up with years of intensive Chinese government investments, thereby proving that democracies can compete."The world is changing," he said. "We have to be ready."While the day-to-day tone is more measured than in the Trump era, tension over Taiwan is threatening to escalate into dangerous new territory.China has ramped up military activities near Taiwan in recent years, with a record number of warplanes intruding into the island's air defense zone in October.The United States says it supports Taiwan's self-defense but is ambiguous about whether it would intervene to help directly."Any connivance of and support for the 'Taiwan independence' forces undermines peace across the Taiwan Strait and would only boomerang in the end," Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in a telephone call heading into the weekend.And China's foreign ministry on Monday put the onus on Biden to improve relations."We hope that the US will work in the same direction as China to get along with each other," foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters.The US administration official signaled Biden would be "very direct" on what he called "China's coercive and provocative behavior with respect to Taiwan."But the official also stressed that the two nations had room for cooperation in various areas, such as climate change.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/guardrails-needed-to-prevent-us-china-conflict-joe-biden-tells-xi-in-virtual-meeting-101637024621707.html
16-11-2021||World||Debris from Russian space missile test puts ISS crew in danger||A Russian weapons test that blasted a satellite out of orbit on Monday spewed debris and endangered seven crew members on the International Space Station, according to US and British authorities.The ground-launched, anti-satellite missile destroyed one of Russia’s own satellites, generating more than 1,500 pieces of debris and hundreds of thousands of smaller chunks, according to the US State Department.“We call upon all responsible spacefaring nations to join us in efforts to develop norms of responsible behavior and to refrain from conducting dangerous and irresponsible destructive tests like those carried out by Russia,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.Five astronauts and two cosmonauts are aboard the space station, which is linked with two craft that carried passengers from Earth -- the US SpaceX Crew Dragon and a Russian Soyuz. The crew was awakened and directed to close hatches between modules on the orbiting platform and then retreated into the Soyuz and Crew Dragon crafts for safety when the space station neared the debris field, according to NASA.“With its long and storied history in human spaceflight, it is unthinkable that Russia would endanger not only the American and international partner astronauts on the ISS, but also their own cosmonauts,” NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said in a statement. The Russian news agency Tass, quoting a source it didn’t identify, said the director of the Russian space agency, Roscosmos, plans to discuss the matter tomorrow by telephone with NASA. LeoLabs Inc., a private space-object tracking company, said data showed “multiple objects” near the expected location of Cosmos 1408. That Soviet signals intelligence satellite was launched in 1982, according to NASA.The American military tracked the event and said debris could remain aloft for decades, posing a significant risk to the crew on the International Space Station and other human spaceflight activities, as well as multiple countries’ satellites.“Russia has demonstrated a deliberate disregard for the security, safety, stability, and long-term sustainability of the space domain for all nations,” said Army General James Dickinson, US Space Command commander. Ben Wallace, the UK defense secretary, tweeted that “The debris resulting from this test will remain in orbit putting satellites and human spaceflight at risk for years to come.”The debris is in low-Earth orbit, an altitude that has attracted companies eager to cash in on reduced launch costs and a growing appetite for data and communications.There was no immediate indication that the newly formed debris threatened any commercial craft.There are about 4,550 operating satellites in orbit, with 3,790 in low-Earth orbit, according to a Sept. 1 tally by the Union of Concerned Scientists. Companies operating in low-Earth orbits include Elon Musk’s SpaceX, or Space Exploration Technologies Corp., which has sent aloft more than 1,800 satellites.More than 27,000 pieces of orbital debris, or “space junk,” are tracked by the Department of Defense, according to NASA. Near-Earth orbits hold much more debris that’s too small to be tracked, but large enough to threaten human spaceflight and robotic missions.Because debris and spacecraft are traveling at extremely high speeds (approximately 15,700 miles per hour, or 25,000 kilometers per hour), an impact of even a tiny piece of orbiting junk with a spacecraft could create big problems, according to the space agency.Moreover, chunks of a smashed satellite can disperse into an elliptical orbit, with some of the debris hundreds of kilometers higher or lower than the undisturbed orbit, Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Center for Astrophysics, a collaboration between Harvard University and the Smithsonian Institution, said in a tweet. “Debris-generating anti-satellite tests are a bad idea and should never be carried out,” McDowell tweeted.Space debris is a growing problem as thousands of satellites are launched, populating orbits more quickly than they are removed by active means or orbital decay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/debris-from-russian-space-missile-test-puts-iss-crew-in-danger-101637022689218.html
16-11-2021||World||Rittenhouse provoked bloodshed, walked off like a hero in a Western: Prosecutor||Kyle Rittenhouse provoked bloodshed on the streets of Kenosha by bringing a semi-automatic rifle to a protest and menacing others, and when the shooting stopped, he walked off like a “hero in a Western,” a prosecutor said in closing arguments Monday at Rittenhouse’s murder trial.But Rittenhouse’s lawyer countered that the shooting started after the young man was ambushed by a “crazy person” that night and feared his gun was going to be wrested away and used to kill him. Defense attorney Mark Richards said Rittenhouse acted in self-defense.Rittenhouse, then 17, shot two men to death and wounded a third during a tumultuous night of protests against racial injustice in the summer of 2020, a case that has stirred bitter debate in the US over guns, vigilantism and law and order.Rittenhouse said he went to Kenosha from his home in Antioch, Illinois, to protect property from rioters in the days after a Black man, Jacob Blake, was shot by a white Kenosha police officer. Rittenhouse, a former police youth cadet, is white, as were those he shot.In closing arguments, prosecutor Thomas Binger said Rittenhouse was a “wannabe soldier” and was “looking for trouble that night.” Binger repeatedly showed the jury drone video that he said depicted Rittenhouse pointing the AR-style weapon at demonstrators.“This is the provocation. This is what starts this incident,” the prosecutor declared.He told the jury: “You lose the right to self-defense when you’re the one who brought the gun, when you are the one creating the danger, when you’re the one provoking other people.”Rittenhouse, now 18, faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison if convicted of the most serious charge against him, first-degree intentional homicide, which is Wisconsin’s top murder charge.Binger zeroed in on the killing of 36-year-old Joseph Rosenbaum, who was the first man gunned down that night and whose shooting set in motion the ones that followed. The prosecutor repeatedly called it murder, saying it was unjustified.The prosecutor reminded jurors that Rittenhouse testified he knew Rosenbaum was unarmed. Binger also said there is no video to support the defense claim that Rosenbaum threatened to kill Rittenhouse.Binger disputed the contention that Rosenbaum was trying to grab Rittenhouse’s rifle. “Mr. Rosenbaum is not even within arm’s reach when the first shot occurs,” Binger said. He rejected the claim that Rittenhouse had no choice but to shoot, saying he could have run away.And Binger argued that once Rosenbaum was wounded, he was not even capable of taking away the gun, which was strapped to Rittenhouse’s body, since he was falling to the ground with a fractured pelvis. Rittenhouse kept firing, delivering what the prosecutor called the “kill shot” to Rosenbaum’s back.“I think we can also agree that we shouldn’t have 17-year-olds running around our streets with AR-15s, because this is exactly what happens,” Binger said.In his own closing argument, Richards, the defense attorney, called Rosenbaum a “crazy person” who was “hell-bent on causing trouble that night” and went after Rittenhouse unprovoked.“Mr. Rosenbaum was shot because he was chasing my client and going to kill him, take his gun and carry out the threats he made,” Richards said, adding that Rittenhouse never pointed his gun before being chased: “It didn’t happen.”After killing Rosenbaum, Rittenhouse shot and killed Anthony Huber, 26, and wounded Gaige Grosskreutz, 28, while trying to make his way through the crowd. Rittenhouse testified that Huber hit him with a skateboard and that Grosskreutz came at him with a gun of his own — an account largely corroborated by video and Grosskreutz himself.But the prosecutor said Rittenhouse provoked that bloodshed, too. He said Huber, Grosskreutz and others in the crowd were trying to stop what they believed was an active shooter.When it was all over, Rittenhouse walked away like a “hero in a Western — without a care in the world for anything he’s just done,” Binger said.The defense, though said Rittenhouse was set upon by a “mob.” Richards accused prosecutors of using the term “active shooter” for Rittenhouse because of “the loaded connotations of that word.”And in an apparent reference to the police shooting of a Black man that touched off the protests, Richards said: “Other people in this community have shot people seven times, and it’s been found to be OK.” ( No charges were brought against the white officer.)When the prosecutor displayed a photo of Rosenbaum’s bloodied body on a gurney during his autopsy and another of his mangled hand, some jurors appeared to avert their eyes. Later, when Binger displayed a close-up of Grosskreutz’s bicep largely obliterated by a bullet, several jurors winced and turned away.As he spoke, Binger walked up to the jury box and lifted Rittenhouse’s rifle as if he were firing, pointing the weapon at a wall.Jurors appeared riveted when Richards, the defense attorney, began addressing them in his booming voice.The sound of a small group of protesters chanting outside the building could be heard at one point during the defense closing, but it wasn’t clear from inside the courtroom what they were saying.Rittenhouse’s mother, Wendy Rittenhouse, listened intently in the courtroom.Supporters have hailed Rittenhouse as a hero who took a stand against lawlessness; foes have branded him a vigilante.Binger began his closing arguments by questioning whether Rittenhouse was genuinely trying to help.The prosecutor noted that Rittenhouse had ammunition capable of traveling the length of five football fields and passing through cars, and asked the jury: “Why do you need 30 rounds of full metal jacket (ammo) to protect a building?”But Richards said Rittenhouse, who worked as a lifeguard in Kenosha and helped clean up graffiti before the shootings, “feels for this community” and “came down here trying to help, to see the damage.”The defense attorney branded the trial a “political case” brought by prosecutors who he said need someone to blame for the violence. “Kyle Rittenhouse is not that individual,” Richards told the jury.Earlier Monday, Judge Bruce Schroeder dismissed a count of possession of a dangerous weapon by a person under 18, a misdemeanor that had appeared to be among the likeliest of the charges to net a conviction. It carries by up to nine months in jail.The defense argued that Wisconsin law has an exception related to the length of a weapon’s barrel. After prosecutors conceded Rittenhouse’s rifle was not short-barreled, the judge threw out the charge.Perhaps in recognition of weaknesses in their case, prosecutors asked the judge to let the jury consider several lesser charges if they acquit him on the original counts. Schroeder agreed to do so as he delivered some 36 pages of legal instructions to the jury.In his instructions, the judge said that to accept Rittenhouse’s claim of self-defense, the jury must find that he believed there was an unlawful threat to him and that the amount of force he used was reasonable and necessary.After closing arguments, names were to be drawn to determine which 12 of the 18 jurors who heard testimony would deliberate, with the rest dismissed as alternates.With a verdict near, Gov. Tony Evers said that 500 National Guard members would be prepared for duty in Kenosha if local law enforcement requested them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rittenhouse-provoked-bloodshed-walked-off-like-a-hero-in-a-western-prosecutor-101637016965618.html
16-11-2021||World||Two shades of blue: French prez Macron makes (subtle) change in national flag||It's a change so subtle it went unnoticed for almost three years. But President Emmanuel Macron ordered a change to the colour of the French flag to find echoes of heroism in France's past.Keen-eyed observers can see that the French red-white-and-blue tricolour flying above the Elysee Palace and also placed behind Macron at news conferences and speeches now has a darker navy blue rather than the previous bright blue.The navy blue colour marks a return to tradition -- it had been then president Valery Giscard d'Estaing who switched the brighter blue in 1976 so that it matched the colour of the European flag, which displays yellow stars on a blue background.The change had been made on the flags placed behind Macron at speeches from 2018 and then on those flying from the Elysee and other presidential buildings from 2020, a presidential official, who asked not to be named, told AFP on Monday.The official said that the navy blue colour "evokes the memory" of the heroes who fought in the French Revolution, the trenches of World War I and in the Resistance during World War II.The change has finally been noticed after being revealed in a book "Elysee Confidential" published this Autumn by journalists, Eliot Blondet and Paul Larrouturou.They reported that the initiative came from the head of operations at the Elysee Arnaud Jolens, whom the journalists interviewed for their book. The change cost a symbolic 5,000 euros."Giscard changed this blue for aesthetic reasons during integration with Europe, but the flag that all the presidents took along with them ever since was not the real French flag," Jolens is quoted as saying.The Elysee official also pointed out that the flag on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris had always had the navy blue.France on January 1 takes on the rotating EU presidency under Macron, a pro-European, while he faces re-election battle in April.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-shades-of-blue-french-prez-macron-makes-subtle-change-in-national-flag-101637016531376.html

16-11-2021||World||Biden celebrates $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill signing||Battered by critics and dire opinion polls, President Joe Biden signed into law the biggest US infrastructure revamp in more than half a century at a rare bipartisan celebration in the White House on Monday.The $1.2 trillion package will fix bridges and roads, change out unhealthy lead water pipes, build an electric vehicle charging network, and expand broadband internet. It is the most significant government investment of the kind since the creation of the national highways network in the 1950s."We've heard countless speeches... but today we're finally getting this done," Biden told hundreds of invitees on the White House South Lawn."So my message to the American people is this: America is moving again and your life is going to change for the better."Most of the crowd were Democrats but there was also a visible handful of Republicans. Notable among the Democrats were senators Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin, two moderates who have warred with more leftwing members of the party, slowing down Biden's agenda.The bill is "proof that Democrats and Republicans can come together to deliver results," Biden said. "Let's believe in one another and let's believe in America."Infrastructure spending is popular, but the goal eluded Biden's predecessor Donald Trump for four years, turning his administration's frequent promises of an imminent "infrastructure week" into a running joke.Even now, Biden had to fight for months to get his squabbling Democratic Party to vote, risking a humiliating failure.Democrats only narrowly control a bitterly divided Congress, but in a scarce moment of cooperation they were ultimately joined by a significant number of Republicans in the Senate and a symbolic handful in the House."We agreed this would be a truly bipartisan process," Senator Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio, told the White House gathering. "This should be the beginning of a renewed effort to work together on big issues facing our country."- Brutal poll numbers -The feelgood moment may be hard to sustain.Biden's ratings are in a downward spiral, with the latest Washington Post-ABC poll showing just 41 percent approving. Most worrying for the White House, support is ebbing away not just among the crucial independent voters but his own Democratic base.And despite the reaching out by some Republicans, the bulk of the opposition party is in little mood to declare a truce.Trump, who is widely expected to seek to return to the White House in the 2024 election, has savaged the 13 Republicans in the House of Representatives who voted alongside the Democrats.He says Republicans who crossed the aisle should be "ashamed" and are not real Republicans.Hard-right Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, an especially vocal Trump booster, called them "traitors." She tweeted out office phone numbers of the 13 fellow Republicans, some of whom reported getting torrents of violent abuse.The pressure is also on in the Senate, where Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who voted for the bill, was among the prominent figures keeping away from the South Lawn celebration.Portman, meanwhile, was freer to make generous comments toward Biden because he has already announced he is not seeking reelection.With Republicans almost certain to make gains in midterm congressional elections in just under a year, Biden's already tenuous grip on Washington faces growing strains.But the White House hopes the bill signing will give Biden, who was due to hold a video-link summit with China's President Xi Jinping later Monday, new momentum.Still pending is a $1.75 trillion package for childcare, education and other social spending that Biden says amounts to a historic effort to redress social inequalities.Again, internal party divisions are holding that up and the proposal has zero Republican support. However, Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told the White House gathering that "hopefully this week we will be passing" the bill.After a first 10 months in power dominated by Covid-19 and congressional wrangling, Biden is "frustrated by the negativity and the infighting," his press secretary, Jen Psaki, told reporters.However, Biden's infrastructure sales pitch will aim to change the tune.Biden will travel Tuesday to New Hampshire to visit a bridge set for infrastructure funding and Detroit on Wednesday to meet union workers. Psaki said "the president wants to spend some sustained time out there communicating."sms/bgs||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-celebrates-1-2-trillion-infrastructure-bill-signing-101637015285614.html
16-11-2021||World||Roads, transit, internet: What's in Biden's infrastructure plan||The $1 trillion infrastructure plan that President Joe Biden signed into law Monday has money for roads, bridges, ports, rail transit, safe water, the power grid, broadband internet and more.The plan promises to reach almost every corner of the country. It's a historic investment that the president has compared to the building of the transcontinental railroad and Interstate Highway System. The White House is projecting that the investments will add, on average, about 2 million jobs per year over the coming decade.The bill cleared the House on a 228-206 vote Nov. 5, ending weeks of intraparty negotiations in which liberal Democrats insisted the legislation be tied to a larger social spending bill — an effort to press more moderate Democrats to support both.The Senate passed the legislation on a 69-30 vote in August after rare bipartisan negotiations, and the House kept that compromise intact. Thirteen House Republicans voted for the bill, giving Democrats more than enough votes to overcome a handful of defections from progressives.A breakdown of the bill that became law Monday:Roads and bridgesThe bill would provide $110 billion to repair the nation's aging highways, bridges and roads. According to the White House, 173,000 total miles or nearly 280,000 kilometers of America’s highways and major roads and 45,000 bridges are in poor condition. The almost $40 billion for bridges is the single largest dedicated bridge investment since the construction of the national highway system, according to the Biden administration.Public transitThe $39 billion for public transit in the legislation would expand transportation systems, improve accessibility for people with disabilities and provide dollars to state and local governments to buy zero-emission and low-emission buses. The Transportation Department estimates that the current repair backlog is more than 24,000 buses, 5,000 rail cars, 200 stations and thousands of miles of track and power systems.Passenger and freight railTo reduce Amtrak's maintenance backlog, which has worsened since Superstorm Sandy nine years ago, the bill would provide $66 billion to improve the rail service's Northeast Corridor (457 miles, 735 km), as well as other routes. It’s less than the $80 billion originally sought by Biden — who famously rode Amtrak from Delaware to Washington during his time in the Senate — but it would be the largest federal investment in passenger rail service since Amtrak was founded 50 years ago.Electric vehiclesThe bill would spend $7.5 billion for electric vehicle charging stations, which the administration says are critical to accelerating the use of electric vehicles to curb climate change. It would also provide $5 billion for the purchase of electric school buses and hybrids, reducing reliance on school buses that run on diesel fuel.Internet accessThe legislation's $65 billion for broadband access would aim to improve internet services for rural areas, low-income families and tribal communities. Most of the money would be made available through grants to states.Modernizing the electric gridTo protect against the power outages that have become more frequent in recent years, the bill would spend $65 billion to improve the reliability and resiliency of the power grid. It would also boost carbon capture technologies and more environmentally friendly electricity sources like clean hydrogen.AirportsThe bill would spend $25 billion to improve runways, gates and taxiways at airports and to improve terminals. It would also improve aging air traffic control towers.Water and wastewaterThe legislation would spend $55 billion on water and wastewater infrastructure. It has $15 billion to replace lead pipes and $10 billion to address water contamination from polyfluoroalkyl substances — chemicals that were used in the production of Teflon and have also been used in firefighting foam, water-repellent clothing and many other items.Paying for itThe five-year spending package would be paid for by tapping $210 billion in unspent COVID-19 relief aid and $53 billion in unemployment insurance aid some states have halted, along with an array of smaller pots of money, like petroleum reserve sales and spectrum auctions for 5G services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/roads-transit-internet-what-s-in-biden-s-infrastructure-plan-101637014932463.html
16-11-2021||World||France warns Russia as EU prepares sanctions on Belarus||France told Russia on Monday NATO would be prepared to defend the sovereignty of Ukraine, near where NATO says Moscow has been staging a troop buildup, while Western leaders sought to tackle a migrants crisis on the eastern borders of the European Union.The European Union agreed to step up sanctions against Belarus over thousands of migrants stranded in freezing forests on its borders with the EU. Belarus, a close Russian ally, said assertions it had fuelled the crisis were "absurd".Speaking by telephone to Russian President Vladimir Putin as part of a flurry of conversations between Western leaders and Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, the French leader spoke of his strong concern over the situation on Ukraine's borders."Our willingness to defend Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity was reiterated by the president," an adviser to Macron told reporters of the conversation Macron initiated.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov earlier dismissed as "wrong" a U.S. State Department statement that the Belarus border crisis was meant to distract attention from increased Russian military activity close to Ukraine, another former Soviet republic.The EU is seeking to stop what it says is a policy by Belarus to push migrants towards it to avenge earlier sanctions over a crackdown on protests last year against veteran leader Alexander Lukashenko's contested re-election.Belarus and Russia have both repeatedly denied any role.NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said earlier on Monday NATO did not want to speculate on Russia's intentions on Ukraine, while adding: "We see an unusual concentration of troops, and we know that Russia has been willing to use these types of military capabilities before to conduct aggressive actions against Ukraine."US ConcernThe US Defense Department said it continued to see Russia concentrate forces along with unusual military activity near its border with Ukraine. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said the build-up was concerning and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin would meet his Ukrainian counterpart on Thursday.Russian-backed separatists took control of Ukraine's eastern Donbass region in 2014 in a conflict that has rumbled on. Moscow also annexed Crimea from Ukraine earlier that year after the former Soviet republic sought closer ties with the EU.Moscow claims the Black Sea waters around Crimea, although most countries consider the peninsula still Ukrainian.In the Kremlin's readout of the call with Macron, Putin said large-scale military drills staged by the United States and its allies in the Back Sea were a "provocation"."This is increasing tensions in relations between Russia and NATO," the Kremlin said.The two leaders also discussed the migrants crisis. Macron's adviser said they had agreed on the need for a deescalation while the Kremlin reiterated Russia's insistence that the EU discuss it directly with Minsk.Migrants - mostly from Iraq and Afghanistan - began appearing on Belarus' land borders with the EU this year, trying to cross into member states Lithuania, Latvia and Poland via routes not used before.The top EU diplomat, Josep Borrell, said a fifth package of sanctions had been agreed by EU foreign ministers and would be finalised in the coming days. They would target airlines, travel agencies and individuals involved in "this illegal push of migrants", he said.Latvia said on Monday it had deployed 3,000 troops for a previously unannounced military exercise near the border. It, Lithuania and Poland make up the eastern flank of the EU and NATO, while Ukraine is not a member of either western group.Several hundred migrants, some throwing stones, made a new attempt on Monday to cross the border near the Polish village of Starzyna, but were forced back, Polish police said on Twitter.German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Lukashenko discussed humanitarian aid for refugees and migrants by telephone, a German government spokesperson said.The talks are the first known contact between the Belarusian president and a Western leader since last year's presidential election in Belarus triggered mass protests by demonstrators accusing Lukashenko of electoral fraud, a charge he denies.Merkel and Lukashenko agreed to continue their exchange, the spokesperson said, but gave no sign a breakthrough had been made. Merkel has spoken twice to Putin in recent days.AirlinesMiddle East travel agencies working together with operators in Belarus provided tourist visas to thousands of people in recent months, a Reuters investigation showed.The EU's executive, the European Commision, said it was looking into whether other airlines should face sanctions after the bloc banned Belarus' state-owned carrier Belavia from its skies and airports. Ireland said EU aircraft leasing contracts with Belavia would also end.Lukashenko said Belarus was trying to persuade migrants to go home but that none of them wanted to return. Minsk would retaliate against any new EU sanctions, he said.The EU has been stepping up sanctions on Belarus for months. Curbs already in place include blacklisting of Lukashenko, his son and 165 other Belarusian officials, as well as restrictions on trade in potash, an important export.In Washington, the White House said it was in close contact with EU allies to hold the government of Belarus accountable.The Kremlin, which has sent strategic bombers to patrol over Belarus, said Putin spoke to Lukashenko on Sunday and Moscow had no plans to reroute gas flows away from Belarus despite Minsk threatening to cut transit to Europe through the Yamal pipeline.At least eight people have died along the 200-km (124-mile)long land border between Poland and Belarus, including from cold and exhaustion. The sparsely populated area of lakes, swamps and forests is becoming even more hostile to people trying to keep warm around bonfires through the cold November nights.The EU's Borrell urged Warsaw to allow humanitarian aid on the frontier, where Poland has deployed some 20,000 police, border guards and soldiers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-warns-russia-as-eu-prepares-sanctions-on-belarus-101637014479540.html

"5 total people have been transported to the hospital."Incident did not happen inside of the school but just north at Nome Park."Local television stations broadcast aerial footage of the park, showing law enforcement officers walking around.Also visible were nearby houses, one of which appeared to have incident tape around it.The local CBS affiliate reported on its website that there were emergency vehicles in the car park of Aurora Central High School, and several adults had gathered outside the school, many of them talking on phones.Colorado is no stranger to gun violence, having suffered two of the most infamous mass shootings in US history.In 1999, two boys shot and killed 12 classmates and a teacher at Columbine High School.Then in 2012, a heavily armed man stormed a movie theater in Aurora, murdering 12. The gunman is now serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole.In March of this year, a gunman killed 10 people, including a police officer at a grocery store in Boulder County, 50 kilometers (30 miles) outside Denver.After a year spent largely learning online, US schools have returned to the classroom, reviving the fear of on-campus shootings, with multiple small-scale incidents reported in recent weeks.More than 256,000 students have been exposed to gun violence in US schools the Columbine killings, according to data compiled by The Washington Post.The figure includes those caught up in the violence, such as witnesses, and those forced to evacuate educational institutions when gunfire erupted.According to a Post database, there were 29 school shootings in the United States in 2018 and 27 in 2019. The Post figures do not include shootings at colleges or universities, suicides or accidental discharges.The deadliest recent school shooting in the United States took place in 2018, when 17 people were killed by a former student at a high school in Parkland, Florida.Every mass shooting provokes anguished calls for gun reform in the US.Tighter gun control is overwhelmingly popular with Americans -- but Republicans have long stood against what some view as any infringement on their right to bear arms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/five-teens-hurt-in-shooting-near-us-school-in-colorado-101637014290597.html
