The duo met on the sidelines of the United Nations’ COP26 world leaders summit underway in Glasgow, Scotland.Addressing a special briefing on Modi's visit to Glasgow, foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said Deuba was thankful for India’s help in rebuilding houses, schools and several cultural sites after the earthquake."The Prime Minister of Nepal started by thanking the PM for the assistance that India had provided Nepal in post-earthquake relief -- the construction of 50,000 houses in the Gorkha district. A number of schools and hospitals and a number of cultural sites were restored, which were badly affected by the earthquake. He also spoke about the cross-border oil pipeline which connects part of India and Nepal and the utility of the pipeline," Shringla said."He also thanked the Prime Minister for providing vaccines in a timely manner to Nepal, including the one million doses that have just been supplied. He also invited PM Modi to visit Nepal at his earliest convenience," he added.Earlier in the day, Modi and his Nepalese counterpart noted the excellent cooperation between two countries during the pandemic, particularly through the supply of vaccines, and medical equipment from India to Nepal.The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), in a statement, said this was the first meeting of Modi with Deuba after a telephone conversation between the duo in July this year when the latter assumed office as the Prime Minister of Nepal."The two leaders noted the excellent cooperation between India and Nepal during the pandemic particularly through the supply of vaccines, medicines and medical equipment from India to Nepal as well as by ensuring the free flow of goods across the borders," the MEA said.Both leaders discussed ways to further strengthen bilateral cooperation including in the context of ongoing efforts against the COVID-19 pandemic.Ministry of external affairs spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said the leaders discussed the issue of climate change and Covid-19. "PM @narendramodi met PM of Nepal @SherBDeuba today. In their first engagement since PM Deuba assumed office, the two leaders discussed ways to further strengthen our close bilateral ties. Also discussed climate, COVID-19 & resolved to work together toward post-pandemic recovery," Bagchi said in a tweet.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-pm-deuba-thanks-modi-for-covid-vaccines-post-quake-aid-during-first-meet-101635871704209.html

He said the protocols and standards of this interoperability would be "some of the most difficult and most important policy work."Facebook on Tuesday announced new European partners in its XR Programs and Research Fund, a two-year, $50 million investment that it says will help it build the metaverse responsibly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebooks-metaverse-can-take-up-to-15-yrs-company-will-enhance-users-safety-and-privacy-says-senior-executive-101635870933658.html

While world leaders have gathered in Scotland, Xi sent a written response to the climate summit aimed at securing net-zero carbon emissions and keeping the Paris Agreement target of a 1.5 degrees Celsius temperature rise."As I understand it, the conference organisers did not provide the video link method," Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at a regular briefing.Xi’s physical absence at the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference was seen as China’s unwillingness to offer any more concessions during this round of talks. As per the expectation, China failed to offer any additional pledge to fight global warming and called on the parties to “build on exiting consensus, increase mutual trust” to deliver a successful COP26 in Glasgow.China argued that it has already made significant pledges including bringing emissions to a peak by 2060 and raising total solar and wind capacity to 1,200 gigawatts by 2030. Xi said in a statement that China will continue to prioritise ecological conservation and pursue a green and low-carbon path to development.“We will foster a green, low-carbon and circular economic system at a faster pace, press ahead with industrial structure adjustment, and rein in the irrational development of energy-intensive and high-emissions projects. We will speed up the transition to green and low-carbon energy, vigorously develop renewable energy, and plan and build large wind and photovoltaic power stations,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-jinping-sends-written-statement-to-cop26-china-alleges-video-link-not-provided-101635866737338.html

The race for fossil fuels also created geo-political tensions, the Prime Minister said at a session on ‘accelerating clean technology innovation and deployment’ as part of United Nations’ COP26 world leaders’ summit in Glasgow, Scotland.He said solar energy was totally clean and sustainable, but it was only available during daytime and dependent on the weather. Laying out a plan through the ‘One Sun, One World and One Grid' solution, the Prime Minister said, “Through a worldwide grid, clean energy can be transmitted anywhere and anytime.”He said Indian space research agency ISRO will provide a solar calculator application to the world.Speaking at the session on ‘Accelerating Clean Technology Innovation and Deployment.’ https://t.co/4bvexwZswy“The 'One Sun, One World and One Grid' solution will not only reduce storage needs, but also enhance viability of solar projects.

02-11-2021||World||China won’t give up on zero-tolerance Covid policy soon: Expert||China’s top respiratory expert has said the country will not give up its zero-tolerance towards Covid-19 policy any time soon, effectively indicating that Beijing will continue to keep its international borders closed or heavily controlled for the foreseeable future.Expert Zhong Nanshan, who formulated China’s anti-Covid policy early last year, gave two reasons for the decision: The policy has helped put down local outbreaks and it is less costly than living with Covid-19 or reintroducing restrictions each time outbreaks recur.“The policy (in China) will remain for a long time,” Zhong Nanshan told China’s state-run English channel, CGTN, adding that the time period will depend on the pandemic situation globally.Zhong said the current 2% death rate of the disease globally, despite vaccination, is not tolerable in China. “Zero tolerance costs a lot indeed, but letting the virus spread costs more,” Zhong said. “No matter how well China does, once it opens up and has imported cases, transmission will definitely occur in the country. Therefore, I believe, for now, that the zero-transmission strategy is not too costly, but is in fact a relatively less costly method.”In a major outbreak in July-August, China counted a total of over 1,200 local infections.In the ongoing outbreak, mostly concentrated in northern China, 538 local cases have been reported between October 17 and November 1.The Chinese mainland on Monday reported 54 new locally transmitted Covid-19 cases, the national health commission (NHC) said in its daily report on Tuesday.Of the new local cases, the biggest number, 27, was reported in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang.Beijing, according to the Xinhua news agency, reported four new local Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, all from the same family, taking the total number in the latest resurgence to 35 including 33 confirmed ones and two asymptomatic carriers.The four cases were from Tiantongyuan, a neighbourhood in Beijing’s Changping district, reputed to be the largest residential area in Asia.“Their confirmation led the community where they live to be labelled as a medium-risk region for the epidemic. Some 142,700 residents living in the community and neighbouring streets were given nucleic acid tests starting on Tuesday morning. The mass test is likely to be completed on the same day,” the Global Times reported on Tuesday.Meanwhile, Shanghai’s Disneyland on Tuesday announced it will resume operations on Wednesday, November 3, 2021, after nearly 70,000 nucleic acid tests conducted on visitors and staff present at the resort over the weekend, returned negative.More than 33,000 visitors inside the park on Sunday were only allowed to leave after their Covid test results came negative as one confirmed patient had visited the resort on Saturday.The total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases on the mainland had reached 97,314 by Monday while 4,636 had died of the infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-won-t-give-up-on-zero-tolerance-covid-policy-soon-expert-101635858226567.html

I know these tapes exist & hope you have them. This z d time," Saleh said in his tweet.I call on @ashrafghani to release the tapes ( esp Jul/Aug) of the conversations with Khalilzad & other relevant foreign diplmts on peace process to counter the growing propaganda that it was & is all the Afghan fault. I know these tapes exist & hope you have them. This z d time.Ghani must do it to counter the growing propaganda that accuses the Afghan side of the collapse, Saleh said in a tweet.He also said in a subsequent tweet posted in Persian that Khalilzad's deceptions became apparent, after which it was decided that other face-to-face and telephone conversations related to him with other foreign delegations should be recorded in secret. "Now that salt is sprinkled on the wounds of our nation every day, it is necessary to publish these conversations."The tweets were in response to claims made by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in a recent interview that Ghani was responsible for the collapse of the previous Afghan government.“I talked with Ashraf Ghani on the telephone and he endorsed that a new government will be shaped led by the Taliban. We wanted an all-inclusive government in Afghanistan. Ashraf Ghani accepted that but the next day he fled Afghanistan,” Blinken had told CBS News.Khalilzad had also said previously that Afghanistan government collapsed since Afghan security forces did not show willingness to fight the Taliban. The insurgent group stormed to power in August following a military campaign which started just three months ago.Khalilzad resigned in October, and was replaced by Thomas West. Blinken thanked Khalilzad for his "decades of service".Khalilzad was the person who led talks with the Taliban in Qatar that resulted in the Doha agreement between the Islamic group and former US President Donald Trump to fully withdraw US troops by May 2021.But he has been criticised for not pressing the Taliban hard enough during peace talks.Afghan leaders lashed out at Khalilzad after his resignation. Rahmatullah Nabil, the former chief of Afghanistan's National Directorate of Security (NDS), called him a con-man. Rangin Dadfar Spanta, a former Afghan foreign minister, called Khalilzad out for his “destructive role in a shameful process”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amrullah-saleh-asks-ashraf-ghani-to-release-tapes-on-peace-talks-with-khalilzad-101635856127326.html

There are no plans to invite the Taliban to the meeting in line with the Indian government’s decision not to rush into recognising the current dispensation in Kabul.“I will not be going,” Yusuf told a news briefing in Islamabad after a meeting with his Uzbekistan counterpart Victor Makhmudov. He was responding to a question from a reporter on whether he would attend the meeting in India.“A spoiler cannot try to be a peacemaker,” he added, in an apparent reference to India.In response to another question, Yusuf said Pakistan has identified India as a hurdle to regional efforts to establish peace and security.“Pakistan has said repeatedly that if India is prepared to move forward, then we will also be ready. But there are some prerequisites and an enabling environment for moving forward,” he said.Among the prerequisites is addressing the Kashmir issue, he said. He added he didn’t see how the two sides could move forward in view of the Indian government’s policies and ideology.The Indian side had earlier planned to convene a similar meeting in April, with the participation of the former Ashraf Ghani government. However, this was scrapped due to the second wave of Coronavirus infections in India and the rapidly evolving situation in Afghanistan at the time.India recently participated in a meeting of the Moscow Format that was also joined by senior Taliban leaders. Indian officials also held talks with the Taliban leaders on the margins of the meeting in Moscow.Iran also convened a meeting of regional countries to discuss the situation in Afghanistan, though India was not invited to the meet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-nsa-says-won-t-attend-meet-on-afghanistan-convened-by-india-101635853487036.html

Local Chinese media reported Yahoo's move on Tuesday."In recognition of the increasingly challenging business and legal environment in China, Yahoo’s suite of services will no longer be accessible from mainland China as of November 1," a Yahoo spokesperson told Reuters in an email on Tuesday."Yahoo remains committed to the rights of our users and a free and open internet. We thank our users for their support."Yahoo's move follows that of Microsoft Corp, which pulled the plug on Linkedin in China last month, marking the retreat of the last major U.S.-owned social network in China. Linkedin cited a "more challenging operating environment and greater compliance requirements in China".Yahoo had already greatly scaled back its presence in China over the past few years. Prior to Monday, it had still operated a weather app and some pages that showed news articles in foreign languages.Yahoo entered China in 1998 and in 2012 struck a deal with Alibaba Group to sell its stake in the e-commerce giant. The deal also saw Alibaba obtain the right to operate Yahoo China under the Yahoo brand for up to four years.Yahoo China later shut its email service and web portal but the brand retained a global research and development center in Beijing until 2015, when it was shut down.Its departure comes as Beijing has imposed fresh curbs on its internet companies on areas from content to customer privacy as well as new laws. On Monday, its new Personal Information Protection law designed to protect online user data privacy came into effect.In May, Verizon Communications sold Yahoo and its other media businesses to private equity firm Apollo Global for $5 billion.The Chinese website of tech blog Engadget, which was also sold in the deal, was also unavailable on Tuesday and only displayed Yahoo's announcement on no longer providing content for mainland China users.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/yahoo-leaves-china-for-good-cites-challenging-environment-101635853411663.html
02-11-2021||World||China asks families to stock up daily necessities, triggers speculation||The Chinese government has asked families to stock up daily necessities in case of emergencies and directed authorities to maintain adequate food supplies, sparking online speculation on the possible reasons behind the directive.The unusual notice published by China’s commerce ministry comes in the backdrop of heavy rains in October that caused widespread flooding and damage to crops including in the province of Shandong, China’s biggest vegetable growing area.Adding to concerns of food supply shortages and increase in prices is the ongoing Covid-19 outbreak, which has led to some lockdowns and intra-provincial travel restrictions across 14 provinces including in the capital, Beijing.A notice posted by the commerce ministry on Monday evening urged “families to store a certain amount of daily necessities as needed to meet daily life and emergencies”.The commerce ministry directive made no mention of an ongoing food shortage or of whether the instructions were motivated by fears that anti-Covid measures could disrupt supply chains or leave locked-down citizens in need of food.Soon after the directive was issued by the ministry on Monday evening, netizens speculated on Chinese social media whether it could be linked to heightened tension with self-governing island, Taiwan, which Beijing claims as a breakaway region and has not ruled out using force to reunite it.The news was trending on China’s Twitter-like Weibo on Tuesday.One Weibo user wrote: “You didn’t tell us to stock up when the pandemic broke out in 2020. This is the first time that such a reminder has been issued. A little scared…countries don’t publish scary news like this unless they have to.”In response, the Economic Daily, a Communist Party China (CPC)-backed newspaper, told netizens not to have “too much of an overactive imagination” and that the directive’s purpose was to make sure citizens were not caught off guard if there was a lockdown in their area.“In the long run it (the notice) is also to advocate residents to improve their awareness of emergency management and increase the necessary household emergency commodities reserves as a necessary supplement to the national emergency response system,” the Economic Daily article said.The commerce ministry directed the authorities to track the supply, demand and price changes of daily necessities including vegetables and meat, and issue early warnings if necessary.The notice said local authorities should strengthen and optimise emergency distribution networks for daily necessities.It added that at places where “closed management measures” for Covid-19 prevention were implemented, the authorities should promptly announce the source and contact information of the relevant supply network.China kept infection numbers low through a Covid-zero strategy of border closures, targeted lockdowns and long quarantine periods.It is increasingly adopting tough measures even to contain a handful of cases - though infections have been detected in several provinces - like in the latest outbreak, especially ahead of the Beijing Winter Olympics beginning on February 4, 2022.Besides the pandemic disrupting the supply chain, China has been hit hard by unusually heavy rains and flooding in the last two years especially in the central and eastern provinces.China also plans to release vegetable reserves “at an appropriate time” to counter rising prices, according to a state TV report late on Monday, quoted by Reuters.It is not clear which vegetables China holds in reserves and how big those reserves are.The state planning body has called for the timely replanting of vegetables, urging local governments to support fast-growing produce, according to the report.Average wholesale prices of 28 kinds of vegetables in October were up 16% from the previous month, state media reported on Monday, citing government numbers.Currently, China has about 100 million mu (6.7 million hectares) planted with vegetables, the agriculture ministry was quoted by Reuters as saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-asks-families-to-stock-up-daily-necessities-triggers-speculation-101635850534463.html

The far-right government of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has particularly come under fire over the deforestation of the Amazon.Greenpeace criticized the Glasgow initiative for giving the green light to “another decade of deforestation.”“Indigenous peoples are calling for 80% of the Amazon to be protected by 2025, and they're right, that's what's needed,” said Greenpeace Brazil executive director Carolina Pasquali.“The climate and the natural world can't afford this deal,” she said.​​​​​​||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cop26-world-leaders-back-deal-to-end-deforestation-by-2030-101635830074477.html

I will bring the plan, and open books.The war of words between the two stems from recent remarks made by Beasley during an interview to CNN, in which he called on billionaires, including Musk and Bezos, to spend a ‘fraction of their net worth,’ amounting to about $6 billion, to help 42 million people who, he said, are ‘literally going to die if we don't reach them.'According to Forbes, this much money would amount to approximately 2 per cent of Musk's fortune of nearly $300 billion. “If WFP can describe on this Twitter thread how how $6B will solve world hunger, I will sell Tesla stock right now and do it,” the 50-year-old SpaceX founder tweeted, drawing a response from the WFP executive director clarifying the remark. Fact check:🔹 2% of @elonmusk's wealth is $6B🔹 In 2020 the UN World Food Program (WFP) raised $8.4B. How come it didn't "solve world hunger"?_ pic.twitter.com/x6w0MJ3Buc“$6B will not solve world hunger, but it WILL prevent geopolitical instability, mass migration and save 42 million people on the brink of starvation. An unprecedented crisis and a perfect storm due to Covid/conflict/climate crises,” Beasley posted.

Maloney relentlessly fought for this cause as she felt that "a relatively small action would hold great meaning for millions of people."Diwali will be celebrated on November 4 this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lawmaker-to-introduce-bill-to-make-diwali-federal-holiday-in-us-101635819028198.html
02-11-2021||World||‘Step down and allow change’: Facebook whistleblower urges Mark Zuckerberg||In her first public address since she leaked a trove of damaging documents about Facebook's inner workings, whistleblower Frances Haugen urged her former boss, Mark Zuckerberg, to step down and allow change rather than devoting resources to a rebrand."I think it is unlikely the company will change if [Mark Zuckerberg] remains the CEO," Haugen told a packed arena on Monday at the opening night of the Web Summit, a tech fest drawing dozens of thousands to the Portuguese capital, Lisbon.The former Facebook product manager replied in the positive to the question of whether Zuckerberg should resign, and added: "Maybe it's a chance for someone else to take the reins... Facebook would be stronger with someone who was willing to focus on safety."The social network, with nearly 3 billion users, changed its name to Meta last week, in a rebrand that focuses on building the "metaverse," a shared virtual environment that it bets will be the successor to the mobile internet.But early adopters of the virtual worlds known as the metaverse blasted Facebook's rebranding as an attempt to capitalise on growing buzz over a concept it did not create to deflect from recent negative attention.Commenting on the rebranding, Haugen said it made no sense given the security issues that have yet to be tackled."Over and over Facebook chooses expansion and new areas instead of sticking the landing on what they've already done," Haugen told an animated crowd which frequently burst into applause as she spoke.Facebook's announcement came amid strong criticism from lawmakers and regulators over the corporation's business practices - particularly its enormous market power, algorithmic decisions and the policing of abuses on its services.The social media network, which operates a dual class share structure through which Zuckerberg and a small group of investors control the company, has hit back saying the documents leaked by Haugen were being used to paint a "false picture."Haugen told British and American lawmakers last month that Facebook would fuel more violent unrest worldwide unless it curbed its algorithms which push extreme, divisive content and prey on vulnerable demographics to keep them scrolling."A key problem is that the foundation of the platform's security is based on monitoring content language by language, which does not scale to all the countries where Facebook operates," Haugen noted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/step-down-and-allow-change-facebook-whistleblower-urges-mark-zuckerberg-101635819016924.html
02-11-2021||World||One case, 33,000 tests: In China, a very Disney story||Shanghai Disneyland was closed Monday over a single Covid-19 case, as Chinese authorities pressed ahead with their zero-infection strategy before the Winter Olympics.China had reduced most domestic cases to a trickle throughout the pandemic, but a flare-up in recent weeks has tested Beijing’s determination to eliminate Covid-19 even as much of the rest of the world opens up.There were 92 new cases reported Monday -- the highest since mid-September.Shanghai Disneyland closed after a woman who visited the park on Saturday tested positive upon returning home to a neighbouring province, state media said.Disneyland said it would remain shut for at least Monday and Tuesday “to follow the requirement(s) of pandemic prevention and control”.The reopening date was yet to be confirmed, it added.The park began barring new visitors from entering on Sunday, with everyone in the park required to take a Covid-19 test before leaving.Nearly 34,000 people were tested by Monday morning, the city government said, with all tests negative.State media footage showed scores of health workers in hazmat suits inside Disneyland, as masked visitors waited underneath fireworks at the park’s landmark castle.The closure comes after Beijing’s newly opened Universal Studios said Saturday that close contacts of infected people had been found among the previous weekend’s visitors.All staff at that theme park -- which entered a “state of emergency prevention” on Friday -- have tested negative and no trace of the virus has been detected on the site, the park added.Beijing is due to host the Winter Olympics in under 100 days, and authorities have said eradicating the virus is their biggest challenge in the run-up.At a Monday press conference, deputy chief of Beijing’s disease control centre Pang Xinghuo said the current outbreak remained “severe and complex”, especially as the weather turns colder.At least three districts in the capital have closed cinemas and other entertainment venues in an effort to curb the spread of the virus.About six million people are under lockdown orders, mostly in northern parts of China.Mi Feng, spokesperson for the National Health Commission, said at a press conference Saturday that authorities would continue to “strictly prohibit people in locked-down communities from leaving their homes”.After logging two new cases Sunday, the northeastern city of Harbin, locked down two housing compounds, closed schools and kindergartens for one week and suspended inter-city bus services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/one-case-33-000-tests-in-china-a-very-disney-story-101635817268616.html
02-11-2021||World||Global Covid-19 deaths top 5 million||The global death toll from Covid-19 topped 5 million on Monday, less than two years into a crisis that has not only devastated poor countries but also humbled wealthy ones with first-rate health care systems. Together, the US, the European Union, Britain and Brazil - all upper-middle- or high-income countries - account for one-eighth of the world’s population but nearly half of all reported deaths.The US alone has recorded over 740,000 lives lost, more than any other nation.The death toll, as tallied by Johns Hopkins University, is about equal to the populations of Los Angeles and San Francisco combined.It rivals the number of people killed in battles among nations since 1950, according to estimates from the Peace Research Institute Oslo.Globally, Covid-19 is now the third leading cause of death, after heart disease and stroke.Russian region extends off-work orderAuthorities in Russia’s Novgorod region on Monday ordered most residents to stay off work for one more week starting November 8 as infections and deaths remained at all-time highs.The Novgorod region was the first to extend the nationwide non-working period between October 30 and November 7 that was ordered by President Vladimir Putin.Russia’s state coronavirus task force on Monday reported more than 40,000 new confirmed cases for the third straight day and more than 1,100 deaths for the seventh day in a row - the highest levels in each category since the start of the pandemic.Putin has said that governments in regions where the situation is the most dire could start the non-working days earlier and extend them if needed.Meanwhile, about 9,000 municipal workers were put on unpaid leave for refusing to comply with a vaccine mandate that took effect on Monday, New York City mayor Bill de Blasio said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-covid-19-deaths-top-5-million-101635816545340.html
02-11-2021||World||BASIC nations underline climate finance goal||Brazil, South Africa, India, and China -- nations that form the ‘Basic’ grouping -- are seeking a fresh long-term climate finance goal at the COP26 summit in Glasgow, according to a statement presented by India’s environment minister, Bhupender Yadav, on behalf of the bloc.Yadav said during the opening of COP26 that the grouping endorsed for the delivery of the promised $100 billion climate finance support for developing countries, and a carbon market mechanism that facilitates private sector engagement in the fight against climate change.The Basic grouping added that its views were aligned with the position taken by the Western African country of Guinea on behalf of the G77 group of developing nations and China.“Delivered the Basic statement at the opening plenary of #COP26, underlining that developed nations have not only failed to meet the $100 billion goal per year of support to developing nations since 2009, but also continue to present it as a ceiling of their ambition all the way to 2025,” Bhupender Yadav tweeted on Monday.At the COP15 meeting in Copenhagen in 2009, developed countries committed to mobilising $100 billion a year by 2020 to support developing countries in climate change mitigation efforts. These funds were meant to come from a wide variety of sources, public and private, bilateral, and multilateral, and including alternative sources of finance.“On the long-term temperature goal, the latest available science makes it clear that all parties need to immediately contribute their fair share,” the Basic statement said. “Achieving it will require developed countries to rapidly reduce their emissions and dramatically scale up their financial support to developing countries. Unfortunately, we have not made much progress on these issues. It is particularly disturbing.”The Basic nations said they were expecting a clear road map from developed countries on their existing obligations to mobilise $100 billion per year from 2021 to 2025… and the willingness to urgently initiate the process within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) of setting a new collective quantified goal on finance.The bloc also said it was expecting a market mechanism that facilitates private sector engagement in carbon markets in the larger fight against the climate crisis.“Decisions particularly on climate finance and Article 6 (which pertains to cutting emissions) can significantly help enhance climate ambition,” the Basic statement said.A finance delivery plan jointly led by Canada and Germany said last month that developed countries will likely be able to mobilise $100 billion funding only in 2023 - with a delay of three years.Such a delay not only risks delaying how countries roll-out climate crisis mitigation measures -- such as switching to clean energy -- but also threatens to open the rift between the developed and developing nations on the crisis. Developing countries like India have pointed to what they say is lack of equity in responsibility and climate justice since developed countries have typically enjoyed decades of unbridled climate restrictions when they grew.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/basic-nations-underline-climate-finance-goal-101635810542215.html
02-11-2021||World||Queen Elizabeth calls for joint action on climate crisis||Queen Elizabeth II on Monday appealed to world leaders to work together in "common cause" against climate change to "solve the most insurmountable problems".The statement, delivered in a video message to the COP-26 conference in Glasgow came after a day of speeches from world leaders warning of the urgency of the crisis."If the world pollution situation is not critical at the moment, it is as certain as anything can be, that the situation will become increasingly intolerable within a very short time...," said the Queen."If we fail to cope with this challenge, all the other problems will pale into insignificance."She added: "None of us underestimates the challenges ahead: but history has shown that when nations come together in common cause, there is always room for hope."Earlier, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres had issued a similarly stark warning."We are digging our own graves," he said, referring to the current exploitation of the planet's resources.But some observers have already denounced what they see as a lack of action to back up the statements from world leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/queen-elizabeth-calls-for-joint-action-on-climate-crisis-101635797770899.html
