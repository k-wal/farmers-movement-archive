WHO spokesperson Christian Lindmeier told a UN briefing in Geneva that countries should take a "risk-based and scientific approach" while implementing travel measures."At this point, implementing travel measures is being cautioned against," the UN health agency spokesperson said. "The WHO recommends that countries continue to apply a risk-based and scientific approach when implementing travel measures."Germany, Italy, Britain, and France have announced travel restrictions on flights arriving from many South African nations. While Germany will ban most travel from South Africa and “probably neighbouring nations”, Italy will be banning entry to those who have been to South Africa, Lesotho, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Namibia or Swaziland in the past fortnight. France has suspended all flights coming from southern Africa for 48 hours.New coronavirus variant in South Africa: These countries are banning flightsMeanwhile, WHO said it will share further guidance for governments on actions related to the virus variant. The UN health agency has convened a meeting of experts on Friday to evaluate whether the new strain constitutes a variant of interest or a variant of concern.Lindmeier said it will take a few weeks to understand the variant's impact, and researchers are working to determine how transmissible it is and how it will affect therapeutics and vaccines.The ministry of external affairs spokesperson Arindam Bagchi told a regular media briefing that he doesn't have any immediate information on the actions being considered by the government. He said that the issue of travel measures is for the health and civil aviation authorities to address."This is a developing incident. We just saw a briefing by WHO. I don't have any immediate information on the steps that we are taking. This is an issue more for our Health authorities & Civil Aviation authorities," he said.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-word-of-caution-from-who-as-countries-rush-to-impose-travel-ban-on-southern-africa-101637925514012.html

The Israeli PM met health experts to discuss the best possible way to prevent the spread of the virus variant which he said was more contagious than the highly transmissible Delta strain, reported Reuters."We are currently on the verge of a state of emergency," Bennett said, according to a statement from his office. "Our main principle is to act fast, strong and now."Israel detected the new virus variant B.1.1529 in a traveller from Malawi, triggering fresh concerns in a country with impressive vaccination figures.  The Israeli health ministry said the traveller and two other suspected cases have been kept in isolation.New coronavirus variant in South Africa: These countries are banning flightsEuropean nations are swiftly moving towards a travel ban on South Africa and its neighbouring countries even as the World Health Organization (WHO) has not offered any comment on the precautionary measure. Britain, Germany and Italy have imposed a travel ban on southern Africa to prevent the variant's spread.Meanwhile, the UN health agency is rushing for an experts' meeting in Geneva at 4.30pm Friday to assess the new virus variant B.1.1.529 amid growing concern."We don't know very much about this yet. What we do know is that this variant has a large number of mutations. And the concern is when you have so many mutations it can have an impact on how the virus behaves," Maria van Kerkhove, an epidemiologist and WHO technical lead on Covid-19, told viewers of an event on social media."This is one to watch, I would say we have concern.

Experts have warned about the “unusual mutations” in the new variant that has been identified in 22 coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in South Africa.Amid European Union’s executive Ursula von der Leyen’s proposal to ban air travel from southern Africa, several member states are swiftly moving to stop international flights from the region to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus variant B.1.1529. Experts have warned about the “unusual mutations” in the new variant that has been identified in 22 coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in South Africa.On Thursday, World Health Organization (WHO) officials rushed to discuss the variant which, experts warn, could affect transmissibility and immune response due to a high number of spike mutations. South Africa’s National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) issued a statement on the new variant, saying experts are working overtime to understand the potential implications."We can see that the variant is potentially spreading very fast. We do expect to start seeing pressure in the healthcare system in the next few days and weeks,” South African virologist Tulio de Oliveira said, as quoted by Associated Press.The alarms bells sounded by experts over B.1.1529 have prompted countries around the world to announce travel bans in a bid to prevent its spread.Here’s the list of countries that have announced new measures:United Kingdom: British health secretary Sajid Javid said that the scientists were “deeply concerned” over the new variant, and, as a precautionary measure, the UK has decided to suspend all flights from South Africa, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Zimbabwe and Botswana.Germany: Health minister Jens Spahn said that Germany will ban most travel from South African and “probably neighbouring nations” to prevent the spread of the new virus variant with a large number of mutations. He added that German nationals will be allowed entry but they have to go through mandatory quarantined even if fully vaccinated.Italy: Following the “path of maximum caution”, health minister Roberto Speranza said Italy will be banning entry to those who have been to South Africa, Lesotho, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Namibia or Swaziland in the past fortnight.France: Health minister Olivier Veran announced that France has suspended all flights coming from southern Africa for 48 hours. He said all those who recently arrived from the region will be tested and closely monitored, reported Reuters.India: While India has not taken the extreme step of a travel ban, the central government has warned states to be extra cautious regarding international travellers from Botswana, South Africa and Hong Kong.Meanwhile, the UN health agency said it has no comments to offer at this point in time over the international travel bans.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-coronavirus-variant-in-south-africa-these-countries-are-banning-flights-101637918725175.html

Its foreign ministry did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.After easing some of its travel restrictions earlier this month, India's central government issued an advisory to all states to rigorously test and screen international travellers from South Africa and other "at risk" countries.Asian countries have fared better than those in other regions in containing the pandemic by enforcing strict preventive measures, rigorous testing and strict border controls.The new variant has a spike protein that is dramatically different to the one in the original coronavirus that Covid-19 vaccines are based on, the UK Health Security Agency added.Taiwan said travellers from "high-risk" southern African countries will have to go into government-run quarantine facilities for 14 days.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told Reuters that New Zealand was well prepared for the new variant. Earlier this week, New Zealand said it would reopen its borders to fully vaccinated international travellers from April 30.Asked whether those plans would have to be delayed due to the new variant, Ardern said the country had "a number of inbuilt measures to act as a layer of protection.""All of our planning around Covid, we have built into it the possibility of variants in the future," Ardern said in an interview for the upcoming Reuters Next conference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/alarmed-by-new-b-1-1-529-covid-variant-asian-countries-tighten-measures-101637915308806.html
26-11-2021||World||Libya: Gunmen attack court ahead of appeal by slain dictator Kadhafi's son||Libya's government has condemned an attack on a court ahead of an appeal by the son of slain dictator Moamer Kadhafi against the rejection of his presidential election candidacy.The December 24 polls come as Libya seeks to turn a page on a decade of violence that has rocked the oil-rich nation since a Nato-backed uprising that toppled and killed Kadhafi in 2011.Libya's electoral commission on Wednesday announced the rejection of the candidacy of Seif al-Islam Kadhafi, who is wanted by the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes.Seif al-Islam was among 25 of the 98 hopefuls whose bids were turned down for non-compliance with the provisions of the electoral law.The unsuccessful applicants were given 48 hours to appeal the decision in court.But on Thursday morning a "group of outlaws" launched an "odious" attack on the court in the southern town of Sebha forcing it to shut -- just hours before Seif al-Islam had been due to appeal, the government said in a statement.It has ordered the interior and justice ministries to open an investigation into the attack, said Khaled al-Zaydi, a lawyer for Seif al-Islam.The attackers forced all staff from the court building "at gunpoint" hours before the appeal hearing, said Khaled al-Zaydi, Seif al-Islam's lawyer."This act is an obstacle to the electoral process," he said in a video broadcast on Libyan media.In the case of Seif al-Islam, the commission had pointed to articles of the electoral law stipulating that candidates "must not have been sentenced for a dishonourable crime" and must present a clean criminal record.The final list of candidates is due to be published by early December, once verifications and appeals are completed.Other hopefuls still in the running include eastern-based strongman Khalifa Haftar, interim premier Abdulhamid Dbeibah, and former interior minister Fathi Bashagha.Both presidential and legislative polls had been slated for December 24, but in early October parliament split the dates of the votes, postponing the legislative elections until January.The path to the ballot box has been lined with disputes over the constitutional basis for the polls and the powers to be given to whoever wins.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/libya-gunmen-attack-court-ahead-of-appeal-by-slain-dictator-kadhafi-s-son-101637911213019.html

It also instructed anyone who recently arrived from those countries to take a Covid-19 test for good measure.Tulio de Oliveira, a member of the Network for Genomic Surveillance in South Africa which has tracked the spread of the Delta coronavirus variant in the country, told the Associated Press that the “very high number of mutations” of the new coronavirus variant is a concern for predicted immune evasion and transmissibility.“This new variant has many, many more mutations, including more than 30 to the spike protein that affects transmissibility,” de Oliveira was quoted as saying. "We can see that the variant is potentially spreading very fast. We do expect to start seeing pressure in the healthcare system in the next few days and weeks.”Although there is a noticeable “jump” in the evolution of the coronavirus with this variant, a silver lining is seen in the fact that it can at least be detected by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Moreover, a team of scientists from seven South African universities is currently studying 100 whole genomes of the variant and they expect to come up with more findings in the coming days, de Oliveira added.Speaking on the B.1.1.529 coronavirus variant, Ravindra Gupta, professor of clinical microbiology at the University of Cambridge, said: “It has a high number of spike mutations that could affect transmissibility and immune response.”Notably, it is yet to be understood if the recent spike in coronavirus infections in South Africa was caused by the new variant, but there is “a high probability that this is the case”, according to Gupta.The number of Covid-19 cases in South Africa had increased dramatically last week. After a period of recording relatively low transmission rates with just over 200 new confirmed cases daily, the country suddenly recorded more than 1,200 on Wednesday. On Thursday, the number of daily cases jumped to 2,465 – a rapid increase was driven by a surge in Pretoria and the surrounding Tshwane metropolitan area, specifically reported from student gatherings at universities.“This is clearly a variant that we must be very serious about,” warned the Cambridge microbiology professor.However, it is to be noted that to date, the Delta variant of the coronavirus remains the most infectious. It has crowded out other once-worrying variants including alpha, beta, and mu.According to sequences submitted by countries worldwide to the world's biggest public database, more than 99 per cent of all global coronavirus cases can be attributed to the Delta variant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/frequent-mutations-rapid-spread-all-about-the-new-coronavirus-variant-in-south-africa-101637894865477.html

The NICD said the number of detected cases and the percentage testing positive are "increasing quickly" in three of the country's provinces.‘Dramatically different’Scientists have said that many of the mutations indicate its high transmissibility and resistance to vaccines, the strain has more changes in the spike protein than all other Covid-19 variants.The UK Health Security Agency has said the coronavirus variant has a spike protein that was dramatically different to the one in the original coronavirus that Covid-19 vaccines are based on. The agency has declared variant B.1.1.529 a Variant under Investigation (VuI).Also watch | India warns states, UTs as new Covid variant found in South Africa worries WHO"This is the most significant variant we have encountered to date and urgent research is underway to learn more about its transmissibility, severity and vaccine-susceptibility," UKHSA chief executive Jenny Harries said."The variant includes a large number of spike protein mutations as well as mutations in other parts of the viral genome. These are potentially biologically significant mutations which may change the behaviour of the virus with regards to vaccines, treatments and transmissibility. More investigation is required," UK Health Security Agency said in a statement.The UK Health Security Agency said no cases of it had been detected in Britain so far.Scientists said lab studies were needed to assess the likelihood of the mutations resulting in greatly reduced vaccine efficacy.Flight bans, new casesUK health secretary Sajid Javid on Thursday announced a temporary suspension of flights from six countries after reports emerged that a new coronavirus variant. Israel also banned travel from South Africa, Lesotho, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Namibia and Eswatini due to the new variant, BNO News reported.Hong Kong confirmed two cases of the new Covid variant after genome sequencing analysis by the University of Hong Kong. One of the cases was a traveller arriving in Hong Kong from South Africa. The other person was quarantined in the hotel room opposite and might have been infected as air flowed between the rooms.Rigorous testingIn India, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan on Thursday wrote to all states and Union territories to start “rigorous screening and testing” of all international travellers coming from or transiting through Botswana, South Africa and Hong Kong."lt is critical for the States/UTs to adhere to the overarching 'Test-TrackTreat-Vaccinate' principle to ensure stringent implementation of containment measures as per Ministry of Health and Family Welfare guidelines," said the letter."It has now been reported by National Cooperative Development Corporation (NDMC) that this variant is reported to have a significantly high number of mutations, and thus, has serious public health implications for the country, in view of recently relaxed visa restrictions and opening up of international travel," he wrote in the letter."The contacts of these international travellers must also be closely tracked and tested as per MoHFW guidelines," said the letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-new-covid-strain-in-south-africa-who-to-call-meeting-uk-bans-flights-101637888437030.html

In light of these abuses, we reiterate our call for all governments to revoke extradition treaties with the PRC and Hong Kong. Activists, dissidents and exiles living abroad must be protected from harassment and intimidation from the PRC authorities," the statement added.Earlier, parliamentarians and activists from around the world had launched a global campaign to oppose the candidacy of Hu Binchen, a Deputy Director General at China's Ministry of Public Security, to the Interpol Executive Committee.As many as 50 legislators, from 20 countries, who are part of the IPAC penned a joint letter to their governments raising alarm at China's moves to gain influence over the global policing body.The letter had references to recent attempts by the Chinese government to use the Interpol Red Notice system to target Uyghur activists living in exile and argues that Hu Binchen's election would give Beijing a 'green light' to continue using Interpol as "a vehicle for the PRC government's repressive policies."Separately, a letter from 40 activists to the Interpol Member States warning that Hu Binchen's election would have "grave consequences for the safety and wellbeing of Chinese, Hong Kongers, Taiwanese and Chinese human rights activists living outside China as well as Tibetan and Uyghur diasporas."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-global-concern-china-s-hu-binchen-wins-key-interpol-post-101637884802760.html
26-11-2021||World||Biden wishes Americans happy, closer-to-normal Thanksgiving||President Joe Biden on Thursday wished Americans a happy and closer-to-normal Thanksgiving, the second celebrated in the shadow of the coronavirus pandemic, in remarks welcoming the resumption of holiday traditions by millions of families — including his own.“As we give thanks for what we have, we also keep in our hearts those who have been lost and those who have lost so much,” the president said in a videotaped greeting recorded with first lady Jill Biden at the White House before their trip to Nantucket, Massachusetts, for the holiday.On the island, the Bidens visited the Coast Guard station at Brant Point to meet virtually with US servicemembers from around the world and personnel at the station. "I’m not joking when I say I’m thankful for these guys," the president said when asked what he was thankful for, referring to the Coast Guard members standing ramrod straight before him on the grounds as he departed.Reporters were kept out of the room for Biden's virtual remarks, apparently because of tight space in the building. Well-wishers waved and cheered as Biden's motorcade navigated the island's narrow paved and cobblestone streets to and from the Coast Guard compound.Biden, whose late son Beau was a major in the Delaware Army National Guard, said he has watched US service members in action around the world, from the South China Sea and Iraq and Afghanistan to South America. He said when foreigners wonder what America is, “they don't see us here,” meaning civilians. “They see them,” he said of members of the Coast Guard and the other branches of the US military. “It makes me proud.”From Nantucket, the Bidens also called in to the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, briefly bantering on air with NBC broadcaster Al Roker. Shut out a year ago, spectators again lined the route in Manhattan as some 8,000 participants joined the parade. Parade employees and volunteers had to be vaccinated against Covid-19 and wear masks.Biden and his wife started spending Thanksgiving in Nantucket since before they were married in 1977 because they were looking for a way out of choosing whose family to spend it with. They did not visit in 2015 following Beau's death earlier that year from brain cancer at age 46, or in 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic put the kibosh on large family gatherings.Biden instead dined at home in Delaware last year with just his wife, daughter Ashley and her husband.But this year, the president joined the millions of Americans who are celebrating the holiday with big groups of loved ones. Biden's entire family flew up with him Tuesday night on Air Force One to resume the Thanksgiving tradition: his wife; son Hunter and his wife, Melissa and their toddler son Beau; daughter Ashley; and grandchildren Naomi, Finnegan, Maisy, Natalie and young Hunter, as well as Naomi's fiance, Peter Neal.Naomi Biden and her fiance rode bicycles along on a local path just before her grandfather's SUV departed the secluded home where the family is staying. The home belongs to David Rubenstein, a billionaire philanthropist and co-founder of the Carlyle Group private equity firm.Biden's visit, his first as president, is markedly different from his previous holidays here when he was a US senator and later vice president. Then, he might have been seen walking around downtown.Biden lost much of his freedom to move around on his own when he became president and now travels with a large group of security personnel, White House and other officials, and journalists.

26-11-2021||World||UK raises alarm over new Covid variant which could beat vaccines||Britain on Thursday said it was concerned by a newly identified coronavirus variant spreading in South Africa that might make vaccines less effective and imperil progress made across the world in fighting the pandemic.The UK Health Security Agency said that the variant - called B.1.1.529 - has a spike protein that was dramatically different to the one in the original coronavirus that Covid-19 vaccines are based on.Officials characterise the variant, which has double the number of mutations as the currently dominant Delta variant, as the "worst one yet".It was only first identified at the start of the week but Britain rushed to introduce travel restrictions on South Africa and five neighbouring countries, acting much more swiftly than with previous variants."What we do know is there's a significant number of mutations, perhaps double the number of mutations that we have seen in the Delta variant," Health Secretary Sajid Javid told broadcasters."And that would suggest that it may well be more transmissible and the current vaccines that we have may well be less effective."Britain announced it was temporarily banning flights from South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Lesotho and Eswatini from 1200 GMT on Friday and returning British travellers from those destinations would have to quarantine.Javid said that more data was needed but the travel restrictions were necessary as a precaution, as scientists said lab studies were needed to assess the likelihood of the mutations resulting in greatly reduced vaccine efficacy.Officials have advised the government on the need to act swiftly and pre-emptively in case the concerns over the impact of variant are borne out, even though it could take weeks to generate all the information needed about its characteristics.Earlier on Thursday, South African scientists said they had detected the new Covid-19 variant in small numbers and were working to understand its potential implications.The variant has also been found in Botswana and Hong Kong, but the UK Health Security Agency said that no cases of the variant had been detected in Britain.“Early evidence from genomic surveillance in South Africa suggests that B.1.1.529 is a serious cause for concern," Ewan Birney, Deputy Director General of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory, said."We know that early action is far better than late action. It may turn out that this variant is not as large a threat as Alpha and Delta, but the potential consequences of not acting on the possibility it could be are serious."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-raises-alarm-over-new-covid-variant-which-could-beat-vaccines-101637877988508.html

26-11-2021||World||Turkish police tear-gas women protesting over violence||Turkish police fired tear gas to break up a protest in Istanbul by women demanding the country's return to a landmark international treaty, signed in the same city, that is meant to protect women from violence.The women marched along Istanbul's main pedestrian street, Istiklal, on Thursday to mark the November 25 International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women. Holding colourful banners, they chanted slogans and vowed not give up on the Council of Europe's Istanbul Convention.Riot police, who had set up barricades at the end of the street to prevent them from proceeding further, fired tear gas when a group of protesters tried to breach the barriers. At least one protester was injured, the Cumhuriyet newspaper reported.Similar protests were held in Ankara and other cities.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan pulled Turkey out of the Convention with a surprise overnight decree in March, triggering condemnation from women's rights groups and Western countries. A court appeal to prevent the move was rejected and Turkey's withdrawal was formalized in July.Some officials from Erdogan's Islam-oriented party had called for a review of the agreement, arguing it was inconsistent with Turkey's conservative values.The government announced its own “Action Plan for Combating Violence against Women," including goals such as reviewing judicial processes, improving protection services and gathering data on violence.Human rights groups say violence against women is on the rise in Turkey.The advocacy group, We Will Stop Femicide, says 353 women have been murdered so far in Turkey in 2021, and 409 were killed last year. In October, 18 women were killed by men and 19 others were found dead under suspicious circumstances, according to the group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkish-police-tear-gas-women-protesting-over-violence-101637875278585.html
