20-11-2021||World||Despite Covid spike, Europe sees protests against lockdowns, vaccine mandates||Even as Europe has been witnessing a rising number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases across the continent, lockdowns have met with protests in the Netherlands, Austria and Switzerland on Saturday. All of these nations, including Germany and Russia, which are seeing record infection levels, are imposing lockdown-like restrictions and banning unvaccinated people from venues, leading to riots and protests.Soon after the Austrian government announced that it would impose a lockdown starting Monday and mandated its entire eligible population to get vaccinated within February, protesters took to streets in Vienna. The protests were spearheaded by right-wing political outfit Freedom Party who have vowed to oppose the new restrictions.Thousands of protesters took to Vienna's Heldenplatz chanting ‘Resistance’ and carried signs mocking Austrian chancellor Alexander Schallenberg and the nation’s health minister Wolfgang Mueckstein, news agency AP reported.The Austrian lockdown will remain in place for 10 days following which the authorities will take a call on whether to extend it for another 10 days. Vaccinations in Austria are one of the lowest in western Europe and at least 66% of Austria’s 8.9 million people are vaccinated.‘Orgy of violence’The Netherlands’ Rotterdam saw violence as police were forced to fire bullets at protesters on Friday. Police arrested 51 anti-lockdown protesters on Saturday and said that a hunt is on for more instigators.“Fifty-one people were arrested during the major disturbances on Friday evening and night on Coolsingel (street) in Rotterdam. About half of them were just underage,” Rotterdam Police said. The police also said that two of these protesters were also hit by a bullet when the police allegedly fired at protesters to disperse them. Ahmed Aboutaleb, Rotterdam mayor, called the protests an ‘orgy of violence’, news agency Reuters reported.Hundreds of protesters also took to the streets of Amsterdam on Saturday to protest against the partial lockdown imposed by Dutch authorities.A news report by AP says that protests are also expected to take place in Switzerland, Croatia and Italy against lockdown measures despite Europe seeing a rise in the number of cases, which health officials have attributed to not taking vaccines and not following Covid-19 preventative measures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/despite-covid-spike-europe-sees-protests-against-lockdowns-vaccine-mandates-101637429844646.html
20-11-2021||World||Brazil faces charges of ‘greenwashing’ over Amazon deforestation||Despite recent headline-grabbing promises to protect its rainforest before the end of the decade, Brazil has once again seen a jump in deforestation.The latest figures released by Brazil's National Institute for Space Research (INPE), which tracks the state of the Amazon rainforest, showed a 22% increase from last year. Some 13,235 square kilometers (5,110 square miles) disappearing between August 1, 2020, and July 31, 2021. The new statistics were dated October 27 — before the start of the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow — prompting environmental organizations like Greenpeace to accuse the Brazilian government of trying to clean up its image during the crucial talks."There is no amount of greenwashing that can hide what [President Jair] Bolsonaro is doing to destroy the Amazon. If anyone believed Bolsonaro's government's empty promises at COP, the truth is in these numbers. Unlike Bolsonaro, the satellites don't lie," the group said in a press statement.A pledge to save the rainforest?Brazil, along with more than 100 other global leaders, pledged during the UN climate conference in Glasgow to stop and reverse deforestation by 2030. Its Amazon rainforest represents about a third of all the tropical forests left on Earth.This huge, biologically rich region is key to helping absorb planet-warming CO2; forests absorb roughly 30% of the world's carbon dioxide emissions, according to the World Resources Institute.But, despite a significant drop in deforestation from a high of 27,700 square kilometers (10,700 square miles) in 2004 to just over 4,500 square kilometers in 2012, illegal logging, agricultural expansion, and damaging wildfires have slowly pushed that rate back up over the last decade — especially since President Jair Bolsonaro took office in January 2019."The environmental track record of Brazil's federal government is appalling, and multiple lines of evidence show that they have been simultaneously encouraging deforestation whilst reducing investment in environmental enforcement," said Jos Barlow, a British conservation science professor based at Lancaster University, who has worked in Brazil since 1998."Without a dramatic change in their approach, the commitments made at COP should be seen in this context — at least until the election in a year's time," he told DW.Amazon has ‘already changed beyond all recognition’The Brazilian rainforest plays a key role in mitigating climate change, but Bolsonaro is primarily concerned with its economic possibilities. Under his government, environmental authorities have been defunded and land protections loosened. This has encouraged loggers, farmers, and cattle ranchers to further develop the Amazon region, some 60 per cent of which — about the size of western Europe — is found in Brazil."The Amazon is in the center of the global debate on climate change," said Andre Guimaraes, executive director of a Brazilian think tank, Amazon Environmental Research Institute, in an email to DW. "It stocks carbon, and it is a source of rain to agriculture and energy. But nothing seems to echo [with] the federal administration, that has chosen wrong, expensive and inefficient ways to deal with deforestation."Some observers believe parts of the world's largest remaining rainforest may be nearing a tipping point, beyond which its ecosystem could collapse and substantially weaken any efforts to limit global heating.Barlow, a co-founder of the Sustainable Amazon Network research group, has noticed significant changes in the Santarem region, in the eastern part of the Amazon. Since the 1980s, he said the region has seen a 34 per cent decrease in rainfall during the dry season, a temperature rise of more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit), and an increase in huge wildfires that have wiped out more than 1 million hectares of forest.“The forests and the landscapes have already changed beyond all recognition in the past 20 years, and the rate of change is speeding up. So yes, it is very close to a tipping point. But I like to hope we can still avert it, even in these regions,” he told DW.EU takes steps to limit deforestationBarlow was encouraged by the actions of state-level governments in the Amazon region, some of which have made their own commitments to stop deforestation. “There is also increasing international pressure, with Europe and the UK committing to deforestation-free commodity imports,” he said.On Wednesday, the European Commission presented a proposal to restrict imports on goods linked to deforestation, among them soybeans, palm oil, beef, wood, and products made from them. Brazil, which produces many of these products, would be hit particularly hard."These initiatives show that the European Union is serious about the green transition," said Frans Timmermans, the European Commission vice president in charge of the EU's Green Deal, adding that this would help "promote sustainable consumption."“This is an important step in the right direction, and it provides a powerful incentive for business to adapt and regulate itself,” said Barlow. But, he added, it wasn't enough: implementation would be a “huge challenge”, as would compliance. And, he pointed out, much of Brazil's beef is exported to places outside of the EU, like Egypt and, more generally, the Middle East. “We need all countries to agree to this.”The measure, which could still undergo changes before coming into force, will still need approval from EU member states and the European Parliament.Barlow also said measures to limit forest degradation and support the livelihoods of local Amazonians were crucial, a stance echoed by Giulia Bondi, an EU forest campaigner with transparency group Global Witness.“The European Parliament and EU member states must now strengthen this law to uphold the rights of Indigenous peoples and local communities, stop EU financiers bankrolling and profiting from global deforestation and associated abuses, and include key commodities like rubber and maize,” she said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-faces-charges-of-greenwashing-over-amazon-deforestation-101637428419784.html

The refineries were targeted with bomb-laden drones, he said, adding that other military locations targeted were in Abha, Jazan and Najran. Saree did not comment on any damage caused by the attacks. The strikes were in response to an escalation by Saudi-led coalition forces, which increased air strikes against the Houthis in Yemen, Saree said. It also came as joint forces backed by the coalition continued to make advances in Hais district in the Hodiedah province.Saudi Aramco, the Saudi energy ministry and the media ministry didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Read more: Iran-Backed Houthis Detained 25 Yemenis Working for U.S.Coalition forces meanwhile said they destroyed 13 military targets for the Houthi rebels in Sanaa, Marib and Saada.

20-11-2021||World||With lights back on, Times Square hopes to regain its lustre||David Cohen has been yearning for a return to the days when business boomed at his family’s souvenir shop in Times Square.While tourists have begun returning, foot traffic into Grand Slam souvenirs is still not what it was before the coronavirus pandemic, when hordes of global visitors crowded under the canopy of electric billboards just outside his door.But the return of foreign tourists to a place popularly called the crossroads of the world may help hasten recovery for businesses like his — many of them mom-and-pop shops — that collectively employ thousands of people and serve as one of New York City’s most important economic engines.“We welcome them back with open arms,” Cohen said after the U.S. began allowing vaccinated international travellers into the country this month. “We’ve got a long way to go.”Times Square had long stood as an emblem of New York’s hustle and bustle, but when Broadway theatres shut their doors at the height of the pandemic, 9 in 10 businesses in the area closed, according to a district civic group, The Times Square Alliance.Three-fourths have since reopened, bit by bit, as Broadway shows began reopening to vaccinated-only audiences.Among those hopefully restarting are businesses that don’t cater directly to tourists, but are part of the city’s entertainment ecosystem.Sam Vasili’s Shoe Repair reopened last month across 51st street from the Gershwin Theater, where it had operated for three decades before a long pandemic closure.Owner Sam Smolyar was all grins on a recent afternoon as he shared the news that a Broadway production set to reopen nearby had requisitioned his help. For years, he had been helping outfit the Rockettes with custom-fitted boots. “We rely on the theatre, and on the businesses around here,” he said.He hopes more people buying tickets on Broadway will mean busier times.“It starts to get better,” said Vasili, who employs three people at the shop.Just before the Covid-19 outbreak, New York City had been posting record numbers of tourists — 66.6 million in 2019, including 13.5 million from outside the United States. Then the pandemic hit, prompting severe restrictions on foreign travel.A marketing blitz has been underway for months to remind Americans that New York City is again open for business and ready for the visiting masses. Now the city is expanding its outreach to those outside the United States, who are especially coveted because they spend more time and more money during their visits.While domestic travel accounted for 80% of New York visitors, foreign tourists account for about half of the city’s tourism spending and typically represent half of all hotel bookings.Tom Harris, president of the Times Square Alliance, said the district is already rebounding. Since May, he said, the number of pedestrians counted in some places has grown from 150,000 per day to as many as 250,000 — still far below the roughly 365,000 people who tramped through the grid of streets before the pandemic.“Between the return of Broadway, the return of international tourists,” Harris said, “we really expect to be at those pre-pandemic numbers sooner than most people predict.”Those returning visitors included people like Marina Galan, who soaked in Times Square from the bleachers under a cascade of lights. She and her friends flew to New York from Madrid on the first day U.S. borders became open to vaccinated tourists.“When you come back to New York, this is what you want to see,” she said. “Everything is kind of back to normal.”Her friend Pablo Leon said he was eager to return. The group took a risk last March when they bought tickets for the Broadway musical Hadestown, even though uncertain about when they’d be allowed to travel to the United States.“That was the true gamble because we bought the tickets for tonight, without any knowledge if we were going to be able to come here,” Leon said.NYC & Company, the city’s tourism agency, is spending millions of dollars overseas to draw tourists back to the city. It projects 2.8 million foreign visitors by the end of the year, a sliver of the 13.5 million who visited in 2019. With borders reopened, officials hope that the number of visitors will steadily rise over the next few years and again reach record levels within the next four years.“We’re hoping to do everything we can to accelerate that timeline,” said Chris Heywood, the agency’s executive vice president.The campaign is initially focused on Canada, Mexico, Brazil, South Korea and parts of Europe, but will likely expand into other countries — possibly into China, a particularly lucrative market because Chinese visitors significantly outspend other nationalities.Chinese visitors, however, may be deciding to stay put for now because of quarantining requirements back home — at least two weeks after returning from an overseas trip.“Daytrips and domestic tourists are helping Broadway, museums and restaurants, but New York can’t reach our pre-pandemic level of visitors until international tourism returns in full,” New York State Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli said. “Reopening America’s borders is a big help, but other factors, beyond our control, make it hard to see when we’ll get back to the numbers we had before the world shut down.”The return of annual traditions like New York City’s big Thanksgiving parade and the Times Square New Year’s Eve celebration could attract more visitors.New York Gov. Kathy Hochul also has announced a $450 million initiative to help revitalize the tourism industry.On a recent day, William Brownstein hawked comedy club tickets to passersby who might now be ready to laugh off the months of grim news.“With all the crazy things going on” — with Republicans and Democrats, with pro- and anti-vaccine viewpoints — “you got to laugh about it,” said Brownstein, who returned from his unplanned hiatus in May, soon after comedy clubs were allowed to reopen.“I think as time progresses, we will see a lot more people come,” he predicted. “It’s just going to take a little time, but they will be back like they were before.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-lights-back-on-times-square-hopes-to-regain-its-lustre-101637421926292.html
20-11-2021||World||'Burning the metro': Chile election divides voters between protest and order||For many Chileans, Plaza Baquedano, a broad rotary in central Santiago that for decades served as a center of social protest, has become a powerful symbol of hope.For two years, city residents have regularly gathered here to protest pensions that are too low, public transit fees that are too high and, more generally, an old-guard political class that just does not get it.The statue of a nineteenth-century general that sat at the plaza's center has been removed, and its plinth is now covered in left-wing political literature.Most credit the protests - known collectively as the "estallido social" or "social outbreak" - for bringing about an ongoing rewrite of the nation's Pinochet-era constitution. The "estallido" has also helped propel the candidacy of 35-year-old leftist Gabriel Boric, a relative newcomer who has become a serious contender in this Sunday's presidential election.But not everyone is so enthralled.Among the detractors is Ramon Zambrano, a doorman at a nearby apartment building."You can protest, but peacefully. They're making a mess, burning cars, burning the metro. What are they doing?" he asks, while pointing out the damage done to the now graffiti-covered building where he works.In a sense, the situation around Plaza Baquedano represents the central paradox of the election in Chile. While Chile's Left gained significant traction via dozens of massive marches that began in 2019, two years of sometimes-violent protests have made many voters wary.That - combined with a widespread perception among Chileans that crime is on the rise - has created an opportunity for the Right to gain ground by hammering home a law-and-order message.While Boric, who rose to fame heading student protests in 2011, had been leading for most of 2021, José Antonio Kast, an ultra-right-wing former congressman who draws comparisons to Donald Trump and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, has risen in the polls dramatically in recent weeks.Most recent polls show Kast drawing the largest vote share on Sunday. A November 6 survey by consultancy Activa Research has Kast narrowly winning a likely runoff in December.Burned OutFor Kenneth Bunker, director of political consultancy Tresquintos, a particularly violent round of protests in late October helped boost the Right.A series in the southern Araucania and Bio Bio provinces - where police and separatist indigenous groups have long feuded - has also played into Kast's hands."I think there is a very important part of the country that's tired, they don't want any more of this," said Gonzalo Cordero, a political consultant and columnist for the national La Tercera newspaper.Boric's supporters point out that almost 80% of Chileans, many fed up with the nation's ultra-free-market economic model, voted last year to rewrite the nation's constitution. A conservative like Kast would do little to quell discontent, they argue."I think that if Kast is elected, there will be an 'estallido 2.0'," said Pedro Muñoz, an elected member of the body re-writing Chile's constitution.Still, the Kast campaign is leaning in to the law-and-order message, as are his supporters.At his campaign's closing event on Thursday night, he pledged repeatedly to crack down on crime. The strongest applause came when he spoke in favor of police officers, many of whom have been accused by the public and prosecutors of using violence against protestors.Several supporters insisted without evidence in interviews that the "estallido" was the product of foreign provocateurs, such as the Venezuelan or Cuban governments.Banners in favor of Trump were common, as were anti-crime banners such as "Orden con Kast," or "Order with Kast."Boric, for his part, is leaning in, too. While for Kast's supporters the protests are a symptom of decline and disorder, for Boric, they are a sign the previous order was not worth saving."We're going to do our politics from the streets," Boric said at his own campaign event on Thursday night.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/burning-the-metro-chile-election-divides-voters-between-protest-and-order-101637410223375.html
20-11-2021||World||China’s 2020 birth rate was lowest in 43 years||China’s birth rate fell below one percent in 2020, marking the lowest rate of childbirth in 43 years, official statistics have revealed, state-run tabloid Global Times reported on Saturday.The birth rate in 2020 was recorded as 8.52 per thousand people, according to the recently published China Statistical Yearbook 2020 compiled by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the report said. According to the report, the natural growth rate of the population was 1.45 per thousand, which was also a new low in 43 years.The birth rate is the number of births in the total population, while the growth rate is calculated after deducting the number of deaths from births.The birth rate in China was 10.48 per 1,000 in 2019, according to NBS data released last year. The latest population data from NBS indicates the extent of China’s demographic problems, which is fewer births and an ageing population. The country’s birth rate has been falling for years prompting the government to gradually ease the one-child policy, which was in place since the late 1970s.“An article published in May this year in a professional journal Population Research, affiliated with China Population and Development Research Center, found out that the monthly decline of birth rate has nosedived in 2020 compared with the same period of 2015, with November and December declining above 45 percent respectively,” the report said.Demographers say the falling number of women of childbearing age, and the impact of Covid-19 contributed to the low birth rate. “There are three main reasons: Number of child-bearing women shrinking, rapid urbanisation and more people receiving higher education, and delay of births due to anti-Covid-19 measures including vaccination,” Huang Wenzheng a demography expert at the Beijing-based think-tank Centre for China and Globalisation told HT.China, the most populous country in the world, is burdened with an ageing citizenry despite scrapping the decades-old one-child policy in 2016.China’s population is growing at its slowest pace in decades with the country adding only 72 million people in the past decade, the once-in-a-decade census data showed earlier this year.In May, China allowed married couples to have up to three children, in a major shift from the current limit of two following a worrying decline in births confirmed in new Census data.“The three-child policy and supporting measures will be conducive to improving China’s demographic structure and implementing the national strategy of actively responding to population aging,” the Chinese government said about the decision.“The document on improving birth policies to promote long-term and balanced population development allows a couple to have three children and draws up supporting measures to encourage births,” it said.The change to the two-child policy did not show the desired growth in population needed to sustain the world’s second-largest economy in the long run.Beijing faces tough social and economic questions on how to look after hundreds of millions of elderly citizens as the younger population is set to shrink in the next few decades.The number of newly married couples in China in the first three quarters of 2021 also plummeted by 17.5% compared with 2019 as the youth’s willingness to get married is declining both in cities and the countryside, a state media report said earlier this month.According to statistics from China’s ministry of civil affairs, there were 5.88 million newly married couples in the first three quarters of 2021, 17.5% less than in the same period of 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-2020-birth-rate-was-lowest-in-43-years-101637410945408.html

He was aged 16, it added.Most of those killed on Wednesday were in North Khartoum, which lies across the Nile river from the capital, medics said.Police officials deny using any live ammunition and insist they have used "minimum force" to disperse the protests. They have recorded only one death, among demonstrators in North Khartoum.On Friday, small groups of protesters rallied in several neighbourhoods after prayers against the military coup, especially in North Khartoum, where people were seen building barricades across the roads. Security forces sporadically fired teargas to disperse them.The SPA reported that security forces had "stormed homes and mosques" in there on Friday."We call for those responsible for human rights abuses and violations, including the excessive use of force against peaceful protesters, to be held accountable," US State Department spokesman Ned Price said in a statement."In advance of upcoming protests, we call on Sudanese authorities to use restraint and allow peaceful demonstrations," the US added.The African Union, which suspended Sudan after the coup, also condemned "in the strongest terms" Wednesday's violence, in a statement released Saturday.AU Commission chair Moussa Faki Mahamat called on Sudan's authorities "to restore constitutional order and the democratic transition" in line with a 2019 power-sharing deal between the military and the now-deposed civilian figures.Sudan has a long history of military coups, enjoying only rare interludes of democratic rule since independence in 1956.Burhan, the top general, insists the military's move "was not a coup" but a step "to rectify the transition" as factional infighting and splits deepened between civilians and the military under the now-deposed government.He has since announced a new civilian-military ruling council in which he kept his position as head, along with a powerful paramilitary commander, three senior military figures, three ex-rebel leaders and one civilian.But the other four civilian members were replaced with lesser known figures.bur/pjm||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sudanese-anti-coup-protesters-call-for-mass-agitation-as-death-toll-rises-to-40-101637407708959.html

But it failed to get the parliamentary nod.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-to-not-allow-nationals-of-third-country-to-travel-to-india-via-kurtha-jayanagar-railroad-101637406686146.html

We want to reduce the use of plastics in packaging and ban its use in items linked to littering," said environment minister George Eustice.“We have already banned plastic straws, stirrers and cotton buds and now plan to extend the ban to cutlery and balloon sticks where alternative materials, like wood can be used.”A ban on supplying plastic straws and stirrers and plastic-stemmed cotton buds came into force in England last year.Forced charges for single-use carrier bags has cut consumption in the main supermarkets by 95% since 2015.The devolved administrations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are responsible for their own policies on plastic waste.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-seeks-ban-on-single-use-plastic-plates-cutlery-to-reduce-waste-101637400181442.html

Muslims generally believe any physical depiction of Islam’s prophet is blasphemous.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ban-on-tiktok-lifted-for-the-fourth-time-in-pakistan-101637398922031.html

She alleged that Zhang, who was a member of China’s top political group headed by President Xi Jinping, had coerced her into sex.“In the past few days, she stayed in her own home freely and she didn’t want to be disturbed. She will show up in public and participate in some activities soon,” Hu Xijin, editor Communist Party-owned tabloid Global Times tweeted on Saturday.He said that he was able to confirm through sources that photos of Peng that had been shared on Twitter by a journalist working for Chinese state media were in fact showing Peng at home, and in her “current state”.“I confirmed through my own sources today that these photos are indeed Peng Shuai’s current state,” Hu said.The United Nations, United States, along with tennis governing bodies, human rights groups, retired players, and several athletes’ lobbies have raised questions about Peng. Several top tennis stars like Serena Williams, Novak Djokovic, and Naomi Osaka have also voiced their concerns about the Chinese star.The UN on Friday called for an investigation into the whereabouts of Peng.“What we would say is that it would be important to have proof of her whereabouts and well-being, and we would urge that there be an investigation with full transparency into her allegations of sexual assault,” Liz Throssell, the spokesperson of the UN Human Rights office, told reporters in Geneva.“According to available information, the former world doubles No. 1 hasn’t been heard from publicly since she alleged on social media that she was sexually assaulted. We would stress that it is important to know where she is and know her state, and know about her well-being,” Throssell said.White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Friday that President Joe Biden’s administration wanted China to “provide independent, verifiable proof” of Peng’s whereabouts and expressed “deep concern” about her.The Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) has threatened to pull tournaments out of China over Peng’s disappearance.The Intense international scrutiny over tennis star’s whereabouts come two-and-half months ahead of the Beijing Winter Olympics, scheduled to start from February 4, 2022.This is the second time that the official Chinese media has come to the aid of the government, which has so far been silent on the case or on Peng’s whereabouts.Foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian told reporters on Friday that the matter was “not a diplomatic question and I’m not aware of the situation.”CGTN, the English channel of China’s official broadcaster CCTV on Thursday tweeted an email purportedly from Peng, in which the sports star alleged that she is well and safe.In the email, Peng also denied the allegations against former CPC politburo standing committee member, Zhang Gaoli.“Hello, everyone this is Peng Shuai.

A Chinese food live streamer claimed that he has been banned from a restaurant for doing just that.Known as Mr Kang, the man told Hunan TV that he was blacklisted from Handadi Seafood BBQ Buffet in China’s Changsha city after a string of binges, according to a BBC report.So, what did he eat?Mr Kang reportedly ate 1.5kg of pork trotters when he visited the restaurant the first time, and 3.5kg to 4kg of prawns during another visit.The live streamer claimed that the restaurant is “discriminatory” against people who can eat huge quantities. “I can eat a lot – is that a fault?” Mr Kang told Hunan TV, pointing out that he didn’t waste any food item.The restaurant owner, however, said that Mr Kang causes him to lose “a few hundred yuan” each time he goes to the venue. He further stated that the live-streamer can drink 20 or 30 bottles of soy milk and consumes an entire plate of pork trotters. “And for prawns, usually people use tongs to pick them up, he (the live streamer) uses a tray to take them all,” he added.The owner said that going ahead, he is banning all live-streamers from his restaurant.Meanwhile, the news of Mr Kang getting blacklisted from the Handadi Buffet has garnered over 250 million views on Weibo – one of China’s biggest micro-blogging sites. There, however, have been mixed reactions to the story with some viewers saying that the restaurant should not be an all-you-can-eat place if the owner cannot afford it, while others feeling bad for Mr Kang.Mr Kang is one of multiple eating influencers in Asia – a trend that has gained massive popularity over the last decade.The Chinese government has lately been clamping down on eating influencers, with President Xi Jinping emphasising on fighting against “food waste” as its crisis remains an increasing concern for the world’s most populous country.According to a BBC report, following President Jinping’s message on food waste, social-media companies commenced taking action against eating influencers. Now, people searching for keywords such as ‘eating livestream’ or ‘eating slow’ are being shown warning notices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-live-streamer-banned-from-all-you-can-eat-restaurant-for-eating-too-much-101637395699922.html

20-11-2021||World||Japan to hold Quad summit next year, Taiwan is the focus||Japan has agreed to host a meeting of the Quad next year - the second in-person meeting of the group - the White House's Indo-Pacific coordinator Kurt Campbell said on Friday. The four-nation group, technically called the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, comprises of the United States, India, Australia and Japan.It is a bloc of countries positioning itself as a check against China's growing aggression in the Indo-Pacific and outside.Speaking at an event of Washington-based think tank US Institute of Peace, Campbell did not explain in detail the type of Quad meeting to be hosted by Japan in 2022. However, Japan Times reported that it could be held as early as next spring.Campbell also said that India is a "critical and crucial" member of the Quad and that Washington is determined to build relations with New Delhi. "I'm very bullish about the future with India. I think we all recognise that the critical, crucial member in the Quad is India," Campbell said at the event.He added that India will be a key fulcrum player on the global stage in the 21st century and along with Vietnam and a few others, tops the list of critical countries that will define the future of Asia.Talking about China, the White House official said that the United States' expanded cooperation with partners is causing China "heartburn" and Chinese President Xi Jinping made clear to President Joe Biden in a virtual meeting on Monday that Washington's work to bolster ties with allies represented Cold War thinking.The announcement about Quad meeting coincided with a State Department statement that the US will hold a session of an economic dialogue with Taiwan in the face of increasing pressure on the island from China. The State Department said that US under secretary for economic growth, energy and the environment, Jose Fernandez, will lead the second US-Taiwan Economic Prosperity Partnership Dialogue on Monday.This is a part of increased US engagement with Taipei to the anger of Beijing, which claims Taiwan as its own.If the Quad summit takes place, it will be the first time for Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who took office in October, to attend such the gathering, and will give a chance to Joe Biden to make his first visit to Japan as US President, Japan Times reported, quoting sources.The first in-person Quad summit was held in Washington in September this year, where leaders of the four countries committed to a "free and open Indo-Pacific".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-to-hold-quad-summit-next-year-taiwan-is-the-focus-101637378511426.html

On Friday, Austria reported 15,809 fresh infections, an all-time high, prompting the government to announce new restrictions. It will be Austria’s fourth nationwide lockdown since the beginning of the pandemic last year."We have not succeeded in convincing enough people to get vaccinated," Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg told a news conference. "It hurts that such measures still have to be taken."Austria’s plan to impose a 10-day lockdown from Monday and mandatory vaccination for citizens starting February 1 has infuriated many, triggering objections from the far-right Freedom Party."As of today, Austria is a dictatorship," Freedom Party leader Herbert Kickl posted a picture on Facebook with this inscription.Meanwhile, a fourth Covid wave has plunged Germany into a national emergency and vaccinations alone, according to health minister Jens Spahn, will not cut the infections. Spahn’s warning suggests that lockdown measures may be on cards for Germany, Europe's largest economy. During a news conference, Spahn was asked whether Germany could rule out an Austrian-style full lockdown."We are now in a situation - even if this produces a news alert - where we can't rule anything out,” Spahn replied. "We are in a national emergency.”With Europe becoming the global epicentre of the pandemic again, some countries are clamping down on the unvaccinated. The Netherlands government has proposed excluding negative tests from the national health pass, allowing only vaccination or recovery from infection, reported Bloomberg.As protests in the Netherlands over the Covid curbs turned violent on Friday night, the Dutch police fired warning shots and deployed a water cannon to push back the crowd. The police said in a statement that two people were injured “related to the fired shots”, without providing further details about the injuries and ammunition used in the firing.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lockdown-in-play-again-as-european-nations-witness-worrying-rise-in-covid-cases-101637376184534.html
20-11-2021||World||Tesla worker alleges women face ‘rampant sexual harassment’ in lawsuit||Tesla Inc.’s female employees face “rampant sexual harassment,” according to a lawsuit by a woman who works in the electric carmaker’s Fremont, California, factory.Jessica Barraza, 38, said in a complaint filed Thursday in state court in Oakland that she experienced “nightmarish” conditions as a night-shift worker at Tesla, with co-workers and supervisors making lewd comments and gestures to her and other women multiple times a week. When she complained to supervisors and human resources, they failed to take action, Barraza says.She suffers from panic attacks as a result of three years of such behavior and “is afraid to return to work knowing that her body could be violated at any time with no repercussions,” according to the complaint. “She is on medication and in therapy, and she is not the same person she used to be.”Tesla didn’t respond to a request for comment. Barraza’s suit was reported earlier by The Washington Post.The case comes as Tesla is already facing what it called a “staggering” $137 million jury verdict in favor of a former contract worker who said he experienced pervasive racism at the Fremont factory. Tesla is now challenging that award.A juror in that case told Bloomberg News that the panel hoped to prod Tesla executives to “take the most basic preventative measures and precautions they neglected to take as a large corporation to protect any employee within their factory.” Tesla has been dogged by allegations of discrimination at its Fremont plant for years, but most employees are bound by arbitration agreements that keep cases confidential. For two years, Tesla investors have tried to compel the company to disclose more information about how it uses arbitration with employees via a shareholder resolution. Each time, the company’s board was opposed to the effort, and the resolution failed to get enough votes to pass despite growing support.“Tesla has carved out the right to go to court on the claims that are important to them while prohibiting employees from doing the same,” David A. Lowe, an attorney for Barraza and partner at Rudy Exelrod Zieff & Lowe, said about Tesla’s use of arbitration. Barraza’s case is “so important on the merits,” he said. “It’s such an egregious and compelling situation that Jessica describes.”Other women have filed complaints about their experience working at Tesla. Rebecca Spates, a Black woman who joined Tesla in June 2019 through a staffing agency, alleged in a lawsuit she was subject to discrimination over her race, gender and age. Among other claims, Spate complained to management about a co-worker touching her buttocks, according to the complaint filed in September in Alameda County Superior Court. Ex-Tesla Employee Called Racial Slur Wins Rare $1 Million AwardIn 2020, 31 complaints were filed with California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing alleging discrimination at Tesla on the basis of race, age, gender expression, disability and pregnancy, according to data obtained from public records. The state agency issued right-to-sue letters in a majority of the cases; a handful were closed with insufficient evidence.The case is Barraza v. Tesla, 21-cv-2714, Superior Court of California, Alameda County.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tesla-worker-alleges-women-face-rampant-sexual-harassment-in-lawsuit-101637373203550.html

The incident took place at Rotterdam; however, it is not clear what type of ammunition was used by the police, the Mail report said.It quoted the local media to further say that 20 people were arrested.The Rotterdam Police said that protesters lit fire in one of the city's main shopping streets, prompting the cops to fire water cannons to disperse the demostrators."A demonstration on the Coolsingel resulted in riots. Fires have been set in various places, fireworks are set off and the police have fired several (warning) shots. The police are present in large numbers and are trying to restore order. The ME has been deployed," the Rotterdam Police said on Twitter.Several videos of the police firing in Rotterdam emerged on social media soon after the incident. One of them shows a person being shot, but its authenticity is yet to be ascertained.The police said on Twitter that it's unclear how, or by whom, the person was shot.There is rising anger among the people as a number of European governments have started to reimpose limits on activity due to increasing cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).Austria has already announced a full lockdown, while the Netherlands has resorted to partial lockdown. There are restrictions on unvaccinated people in parts of Germany, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.Germany has said further measures will be decided based on when hospitalisation rates hit certain thresholds. In France, President Emmanuel Macron has made it clear he thinks high levels of vaccinations should be enough to avoid future lockdowns.Britain, with higher numbers of infections than most countries in Europe, is rolling out third shots - or boosters - to offset waning protection from the first two and help keep the economy open.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rotterdam-police-open-fire-as-protest-over-covid-curbs-turns-violent-7-injured-101637372256102.html
20-11-2021||World||Checkup finds Biden fit for duty; Kamala Harris briefly in power||President Joe Biden remains “healthy” and “vigorous” and fit for duty, but is showing some signs of aging, his doctor said Friday after the oldest president in American history underwent his first routine physical in office and — in a history-making moment — briefly transferred power to Vice President Kamala Harris while he underwent a colonoscopy.Harris, the first woman, first Black person and first person of South Asian descent to be vice president, was — for one hour and 25 minutes — acting president while Biden was under anesthesia.Over more than five hours Friday at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, the president underwent a battery of blood, physical, gastrointestinal, dental, vision and neurological examinations. Dr. Kevin O’Connor, who has been Biden’s primary care physician since 2009, wrote in a six-page memo released by the White House that Biden, who turns 79 on Saturday, “remains a healthy, vigorous, 78-year-old male, who is fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency.”O’Connor, however, revealed that he investigated Biden for increased instances of “throat clearing” during public remarks and a stiffening of his gait. O’Connor reported that Biden’s coughing was the result of gastrointestinal reflux and that the stiffened gait was the result of a new diagnosis of “mild peripheral neuropathy,” spinal arthritis and compensation for a broken foot sustained a year ago.Interest in Biden’s health has been high ever since he declared his candidacy for the White House in 2019 and remains intense as speculation about a 2024 reelection bid swirls. The visit to the medical center in the Washington suburbs was for his first routine physical exam as president — and his first since December 2019.As part of the screening, Biden underwent an “extremely detailed neurological exam” that ruled out stroke, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, but caught the neuropathy, which is nerve damage in the hands and feet. O’Connor said the most common cause of the condition is diabetes, but Biden is not diabetic. Biden, he said, would soon try custom orthotics to improve his gait.During the course of Biden's colonoscopy a “benign-appearing polyp” of about 3 millimeters was identified and removed and would be studied over the coming week. O’Connor said Biden has never had colon cancer.Biden's reported body mass index classified him as slightly overweight, but his cholesterol was under control. Biden, O'Connor said, is prescribed the anticoagulant Eliquis, the statin Crestor and the seasonal allergy spray Dymista, and regularly takes the over-the-counter allergy pill Allegra and the antacid Pepcid.O'Connor reported that Biden does not use tobacco products or drink alcohol and that he exercises at least five days per week.Press secretary Jen Psaki said he resumed his duties after speaking with Harris and White House chief of staff Ron Klain at approximately 11:35 a.m.As Biden left the medical center in the afternoon, he said he was feeling “Great!”“Great physical and a great House of Representatives vote,” he said, referring to the House passage of his roughly $2 trillion social and environmental agenda.After arriving back at the White House, he said “Nothing’s changed” with his health, joking, "We’re in great shape, and I’m looking forward to celebrating my 58th birthday.”While serving as acting president Harris was working from her office in the West Wing, Psaki said. She later traveled to Ohio once Biden awoke from the procedure.Biden was keenly aware of the history he was making when he selected Harris to be his running mate, Psaki said, adding that she made “history every day” in the job.“Today was certainly another chapter in that history I think that will be noted for women, young girls across the country," she added.During Biden's last physical exam, doctors found the former vice president to be “healthy, vigorous” and “fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency," according to a doctor’s report at the time.In that report, O’Connor said that since 2003, Biden has had episodes of atrial fibrillation, a type of irregular heartbeat that’s potentially serious but treatable. At the time, O’Connor cited a list of tests that showed Biden’s heart was functioning normally and his only needed care was a blood thinner to prevent the most worrisome risk, blood clots or stroke.Biden had a brush with death in 1988, requiring surgery to repair two brain aneurysms, weak bulges in arteries, one of them leaking. Biden has never had a recurrence, his doctor said, citing a test in 2014 that examined his arteries.Dr. Jeffrey Linder, chief of general internal medicine and geriatrics at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine, read the White House report and said it contained nothing that’s particularly worrisome.“All in all, according to this report it seems like he’s in pretty good shape, with very common age-related illness,’’ including atrial fibrillation and stiff gait, Linder said.While the cause of Biden’s mild neuropathy is unknown, Linder said it is not an unusual problem and not a cause for concern unless it’s bothersome for the president. He added that there is no reason to think the small polyp that was removed was cancerous, given Biden’s previous medical history.“I would encourage him to continue to get exercise and eat right and take his medications,’’ Linder said.Pursuant to the 25th Amendment to the Constitution, Biden signed letters to Sen. Patrick Leahy, who's president pro tempore of the Senate, and to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi at 10:10 a.m., saying he would be unable to discharge his duties while under anesthesia, making Harris the acting president. Biden sent them each another letter upon the conclusion of the procedure to resume his duties at 11:35 a.m.“As was the case when President George W. Bush had the same procedure in 2002 and 2007, and following the process set out in the Constitution, President Biden will transfer power to the Vice President for the brief period of time when he is under anesthesia,” Psaki said before Biden’s colonoscopy.On Friday afternoon, Biden took part in the annual pardoning of the national Thanksgiving turkey.When Biden took office he brought O’Connor back to the White House to continue serving as his doctor, and O'Connor led a team of experts in conducting Biden's physical exam Friday.Once the Covid-19 pandemic emerged in early 2020, Biden’s team took intense steps to keep the then-candidate and now-president healthy as the virus raged and took a disproportionate toll among older populations. Biden received his first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine in December 2020 and his second dose just two weeks before taking office. He received a booster dose, which regulators say provides more enduring protection, in late September.Former President Donald Trump, 75, was sharply criticized for releasing only cursory details on his health while running and serving in the White House, including concealing the seriousness of his Covid-19 illness a month before the 2020 presidential election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/checkup-finds-biden-vigorous-kamala-harris-briefly-in-power-101637371243052.html
20-11-2021||World||Beijing Olympics: US considers diplomatic boycott over alleged human rights abuses||President Joe Biden said on Thursday he was considering a US diplomatic boycott of the Winter Olympics in Beijing, in what would be an attempt to show toughness over China’s rights abuses without impacting US athletes.That is “something we are considering”, Biden told reporters while meeting with Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, at the White House. The Beijing Olympics take place next February.Biden’s comments followed a long-awaited video summit with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping late on Monday, during which the two leaders said they wanted to ensure stability and prevent accidental conflicts.The US president is under pressure at home to speak out on China’s human rights abuses, especially in the Xinjiang region where the US government says repression of the Uighur ethnic group qualifies as genocide.China’s foreign ministry on Friday brushed off the rights accusations as “inconsistent with the truth and completely groundless”, calling Washington’s claims a “joke in the eyes of Chinese people”.Lithuania will ‘pay for what it did’: ChinaChina on Friday said Lithuania will “pay for what it did”, a day after the Baltic nation allowed Taiwan to open a de facto embassy in the capital.“Lithuania only has itself to blame, it will have to pay for what it did,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said on Friday.China’s reaction came after Lithuania allowed Taipei to open a representative office in the capital, Vilnius, ignoring Beijing’s strong opposition. China claims Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy, as a breakaway region to be reunified by force if required.Only 15 countries have direct diplomatic ties with Taiwan, prompting China to say those countries violate the “one China” policy under which only the mainland is recognised formally.Agency reports from Taipei quoted the Taiwanese foreign ministry as saying that the opening of the office would “charter a new and promising course” for Taiwan-Lithuania ties.US warns China on action against PhilippinesThe US on Friday accused China of an escalation against the Philippines and warned that an armed attack would invite a US response after an incident in disputed waters.“The United States stands with our ally, the Philippines, in the face of this escalation that directly threatens regional peace and stability,” state department spokesman Ned Price said.(With inputs from Sutirtho Patranobis)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-olympics-us-considers-diplomatic-boycott-over-alleged-human-rights-abuses-101637358648975.html
20-11-2021||World||Western Europe battles Covid surge||Austria will become the first country in western Europe to reimpose a full coronavirus lockdown this autumn to tackle a new wave of infections, and will require its whole population to be vaccinated as of February, its government said on Friday.Austria will become the first country in western Europe to reimpose a full coronavirus lockdown this autumn to tackle a new wave of infections, and will require its whole population to be vaccinated as of February, its government said on Friday.|#+|Austrian Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg said on Friday that the lockdown will start on Monday and initially last for 10 days. Most stores will close, and cultural events will be cancelled. He initially said all students would have to go back into home schooling.Starting on February 1, the country will also make vaccinations mandatory, public broadcaster ORF reported.“We do not want a fifth wave,” Schallenberg said, according to ORF. “Not do we want a sixth or seventh wave.”Austria had initially introduced a national lockdown only for the unvaccinated that started on Monday, but as virus cases continued to skyrocket the government said it had no choice but to extend it to everyone.“This is very painful,” Schallenberg said.Roughly two-thirds of Austria’s population is fully vaccinated against Covid-19, one of the lowest rates in western Europe.Its infections are among the highest on the continent, with a seven-day incidence of 991 per 100,000 people.“We have not succeeded in convincing enough people to get vaccinated,” Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg told a news conference.With cold weather setting in across Europe as winter approaches, governments have been forced to consider reimposing unpopular lockdowns. The Netherlands has reimposed a partial lockdown, with bars and restaurants closing at 8pm.Germany may impose lockdown for vaccinatedGermany’s coronavirus situation is so grave that a lockdown, including people who have been vaccinated, cannot be ruled out, the health minister said on Friday. “We are now in a situation - even if this produces a news alert - where we can’t rule anything out,” acting health minister Jens Spahn saidGermany reported 52,970 new coronavirus cases and 201 deaths on Friday, bringing total deaths to 98,739.Russian authorities on Friday reported a record number of deaths for the third day in a row. Russia’s state coronavirus task force reported 1,254 virus deaths, up 1,251 on Thursday and 1,247 on Wednesday.Norwegian officials said on Friday the country is introducing stricter controls at border crossings, requiring everyone to register before entering the country, in a bid to tackle the rise in Covid cases.Travellers from the UK who have gotten their third coronavirus vaccine dose will now be able to prove their status through the National Health Service’s Covid app. The change, effective on Friday, will allow travellers to enter countries including Israel, Croatia and Austria that have set time limits for the vaccines to be valid for travel without quarantining, the UK government said.“We want to make it as easy as possible for people to show their vaccine status if they are travelling abroad,” health and social care secretary Sajid Javid said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/western-europe-battles-covid-surge-101637356818858.html
20-11-2021||World||US House advances Biden's expansive social and environment bill, Senate awaits||US lawmakers voted Friday to elevate President Joe Biden's giant social welfare bill to the Senate, in a major step forward for his vision for a more equitable society that is the centerpiece of his domestic agenda.US lawmakers voted Friday to elevate President Joe Biden's giant social welfare bill to the Senate, in a major step forward for his vision for a more equitable society that is the centerpiece of his domestic agenda.|#+|Build Back Better – Biden's potentially legacy-defining package of education, health care, childcare, and climate reforms – was green-lit by the House four days after the president signed off on the first part of his economic blueprint, a sweeping upgrade of the country's crumbling infrastructure.The $1.8 trillion measure is likely to get a bumpier ride in the upper chamber, with the Democrats' deficit hawks jittery over spiraling inflation – before it gets a final rubber stamp in the House, likely in December or January."We have a Build Back Better bill that is historic, transformative, and larger than anything we have ever done before," Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on the House floor ahead of the vote."We are building back better... We all agree that we have a moral responsibility to our children, to their future, to pass on the planet in a responsible way. So we are proud to be passing this legislation, under the leadership of President Joe Biden."Pelosi had hoped to vote on the measure late Thursday but Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy halted the action by breaking her record for the longest House floor speech, clocking in at more than eight-and-a-half hours.Under House rules the party leaders are allowed a courtesy "magic minute," meaning they can be recognized to speak for as long as they wish while the rank and file get just 60 seconds.The breakthrough vote in the House came as Biden was set to transfer power to Vice President Kamala Harris while he underwent a colonoscopy under anesthesia as part of a regular health check.Rambling addressMcCarthy finally yielded the floor at 5:11 am after beginning speaking at 8:38 pm Thursday, in a rambling address that appeared as much about pushing talking points to his members as it was an effort to change any minds on the bill.The legislation would provide millions of jobs, according to the White House, although Republicans have characterized it as an example of wildly out-of-control Democratic spending.It will likely be watered down in the upper chamber, however, where Democrats have the narrowest of majorities and moderates are voicing concerns over Biden's spending plans.Annual inflation jumped to 6.2 percent last month, giving Republicans another cudgel to bash Biden with as they bid to retake both chambers of Congress in next year's midterm elections.House Democrats would have lost the party-line vote had there been more than three defectors.In the end only one Democrat -- from a competitive district in Maine --- joined the Republicans in rejecting the bill, boosting the majority party's hopes that members in both chambers can overcome months of infighting to get the package signed into law.The prospect of a vote ahead of next week's Thanksgiving recess had initially looked slim, with a handful of centrist Democrats demanding a full analysis from the Congressional Budget Office to clarify the cost of the package before they will agree to vote.That came Thursday evening, with the CBO saying Build Back Better would boost the deficit by $367 billion over 10 years.‘Craptacular mess’This might normally be a problem for the Democrats' fiscal conservatives, but they were largely assuaged by White House officials pointing out that the estimate does not include savings that could be made through tougher taxation enforcement.Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement that Build Back Better was "fully paid for," and would help reduce the deficit in the long run via reforms "that ask the wealthiest Americans and large corporations to pay their fair share."Senate insiders expect the bill to be taken up by the upper chamber in late December or possibly January, with more urgent priorities such as avoiding a debt default and a government shutdown expected to take up much of the holiday period.The Senate has been locked in a 50-50 split for one of the longest periods in its history, and, with no votes to spare, every Democrat effectively has a veto on any bill as long as Republicans stick together.Senate progressives are pushing for a national paid family leave program and a bigger expansion of health care benefits, but the latest inflation data could harm those efforts.Senator Ben Sasse led the Senate Republicans' criticism of the bill ahead of the vote, labeling it a “craptacular mess” that will lead to “a million more annual IRS audits.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-house-advances-biden-s-expansive-social-and-environment-bill-senate-awaits-101637334856073.html
20-11-2021||World||China conducted hypersonic weapons test, sent missile around the world: Report||China conducted a hypersonic weapons test in July by sending a missile around the world at more than five times the speed of sound. The details of the test were shared by General John Hyten, the vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff of the United States.“They launched a long-range missile. It went around the world, dropped off a hypersonic glide vehicle that glided all the way back to China, and impacted a target in China,” Hyten, the second highest-ranking American military officer, said while speaking to news agency CBS News.Hyten said that China may one day be able to launch a surprise nuclear attack on the US. He said that the missile may have missed its mark but it was close enough to hitting its target.A report by Financial Times said that the missile missed its target by several kilometres but it was the first time any nation tested a hypersonic missile around the planet. Hypersonic weapons travel more than five times the speed of sound which poses a challenge for radars trying to detect them.Hyten said the missiles are a ‘ first-use weapon' and added that China carried out hundreds of hypersonic tests, while the US has conducted just nine. He also said that the US did not field a hypersonic weapon but China deployed one medium-range hypersonic weapon.China downplayed the claims while confirming the test on October 18. It said that it was a ‘spacecraft and not a missile’. “As we understand, this was a routine test of spacecraft to verify technology of spacecraft's reusability. It is of great significance to reducing the cost of using spacecraft and providing a convenient and cheap way for mankind's two-way transportation in the peaceful use of space. Several companies around the world have conducted similar tests. It's not a missile, but a spacecraft,” Zhao Lijian, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, was quoted as saying by news agencies earlier last month.The Pentagon earlier this month said that China is rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal and may have 1,000 nuclear warheads by the end of the decade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-conducted-hypersonic-weapons-test-sent-missile-around-the-world-report-101637324307809.html
