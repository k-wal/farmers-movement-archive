China has been hit hard by the COVID-19 outbreak since it emerged in the country late last year, with more than 80,000 infected and nearly 3,300 dead nationwide, according to official figures. The world’s second-largest economy ground to a halt in February as authorities shut factories and imposed drastic lockdowns to curb the spread of the disease.Economic growth had already slowed as a result of the long-running trade war with the United States that saw billions of dollars in tariffs slapped on trade between the two countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-xi-calls-for-tariff-cuts-at-g20-virus-talks/story-qsxgLEAfq4FNJmQYZHbHlJ.html
26-03-2020||World||Pope tests negative after employee gets covid-19: Report||Pope Francis was reported Thursday to have tested negative for the novel coronavirus after a person in his residence was said to have contacted COVID-19.Several Italian newspapers with reputable sources in the Vatican said the Italian clergyman who got sick had lived for years in the pope’s Saint Martha’s residence.Il Messaggero said the person is “one of the pope’s closest collaborators, an official of the Secretariate of the State, who was found to have a slight temperature after going in for a routine check”.The daily La Stampa said the unnamed person has been hospitalised in Rome and that his office has been disinfected.Il Messaggero later reported that the pope himself was tested for the virus and came out clean.The 83-year-old pontiff has remained largely secluded at his residence since coming down with a cold late last month.La Stampa said he has been “eating alone in his room for some time” and has food brought to him on a tray by secretaries.“He spends much of his time in his apartment, and when he moves inside the residence, he keeps the necessary safe distances,” La Stampa wrote.“The anti-contagion cordon has been tight around the pope for weeks.”The official Vatican News site said the number of people infected in the city state has risen to four.The ANSA news agency said the Italian clergyman in the pope’s residence was a fifth case not reported by official sources.UnexpectedLife in the Vatican has been shrouded in secrecy and little in known about how popes spend their days.But the Argentine-born pontiff has tried to connect more with the people and do away with some the Vatican’s more formal traditions.He refused to move into the luxurious papal palace upon being elected to succeed pope Benedict XVI in March 2013.His Saint Martha’s residence is a simple building erected next to Saint Peter’s Basilica in 1996.It is also the place where cardinals stay when they gather for conclaves to elect new popes.Francis stayed there for the 2013 election and then never moved out when he was picked.Il Messaggero said only about 30 people live at the residence and “no one would have expected” for one of them would get sick because their circle of contacts was so small.The Argentine-born pontiff has enjoyed a life of good health despite losing part of a lung as a young man and suffering from sciatica -- a nerve condition that causes pain in his hip.Italian news reports said he was not currently considering moving to a more isolated location because of the four cases in the Vatican.“In any case, the pope is constantly surrounded by a staff equipped with disinfectant products,” La Stampa wrote.The pope’s daily prayer Thursday touched on people’s fears in the face of the new disease.“Each one knows what their own fears are,” Francis said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-tests-negative-after-colleague-gets-covid-19-report/story-Geh52xiFP119H0w5AtVx0N.html
26-03-2020||World||G20 Virtual Summit: Saudi king urges effective response to coronavirus crisis||Saudi Arabia’s King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud on Thursday urged G20 leaders to take “effective and coordinated” action to fight the global health crisis set off by the coronavirus pandemic. He urged leaders attending the summit to do their best to assist all developing nations.Leaders of the G20 convened the Extraordinary Virtual Summit on Thursday evening even as wealthy countries including the United States unveiled huge economic stimulus packages.Till date, there has been no collective action plan from the G20, and the group has been criticised for its slow response.In his opening remarks as G20 leaders began an emergency online summit in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, the king detailed the destruction and damage the disease had caused on the global economy, financial markets, trade as well as global supply chains.“We must have an effective and coordinated response to this pandemic and restore confidence in the global economy,” the Saudi King said.India is expected to push for a coordinated and forward-looking approach at the extraordinary G20 virtual leaders’ summit. The summit is being held against the backdrop of a divide in the G7 over US efforts to label Covid-19 as the “Wuhan virus”.Members of the G20, which includes 19 of the world’s largest economies and the European Union, are engaged in hectic negotiations to finalise a joint communiqué to be issued after the meeting.“This human crisis requires a global response. The world counts on us to come together and cooperate in order to face this challenge,” the Saudi King said. As concerns mount for poorer countries without access to capital markets and adequate health facilities, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have urged G20 leaders to support its call for governments to put debt payments on hold.The members are also expected to outline their individual positions in separate statements during the video conference that has been convened by G20 president Saudi Arabia to discuss a joint response to the Covid-19 pandemic.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his statement, is expected to refer to India’s role in forging a coordinated response through the video conference of leaders of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) on March 15 and how this could be replicated by other countries.On Wednesday, other members of the G7 had spurned the US state department’s push to include the phrase “Wuhan virus” in a joint statement that was to be issued after a video conference of the grouping’s foreign ministers. The members issued separate statements that reflected the divisions within the G7.The US was responsible for framing the draft statement as it is the current president of the G7, which includes the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Canada.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/g20-virtual-summit-saudi-king-urges-effective-response-to-coronavirus-crisis/story-yqgRRP5tIiveDB4bPcHJgN.html
26-03-2020||World||Germany boosts coronavirus test rate to 500,000 a week||Germany has boosted its coronavirus test rate to 500,000 a week, a virologist said Thursday, adding that early detection has been key in keeping the country’s death rate relatively low.“The reason why Germany has so few deaths compared to the number of infected people can be explained by the fact that we carry out an extremely large number of laboratory diagnostic tests,” said Christian Drosten, who heads the Institute of Virology at Berlin’s Charite University Hospital.“Estimates from the last days show that we are carrying out half a million tests a week,” he added.Drosten also highlighted Germany’s dense network of laboratories spread across its territory as a factor contributing to early detection.Meanwhile the research ministry said it would commit 150 million euros ($164 million) to improve communication between hospitals and laboratories about coronavirus patients’ health data, hoping the information exchange could feed into development of a vaccine.Official data compiled by the disease control agency Robert Koch Institute show that 36,508 people have been infected in Germany, including 198 who have died from the disease.At 0.54 percent, Germany’s death rate is far lower than the 7.3 percent in Spain where 4,089 deaths were recorded for 56,188 confirmed cases. France has also recorded 1,331 fatalities of 25,233 confirmed infections -- a death rate of 5.2 percent.Besides the large-scale testing, experts in Germany also said that the virus has largely affected a younger, healthier section of the population compared to elsewhere.At the same time, experts have repeatedly warned that in the country where almost a quarter of the population is over 60, the number of deaths could still skyrocket if people do not stick to measures to help halt contagion. Lockdown measures are in place across Germany, preventing people from leaving their homes except for essential trips, while most shops, restaurants and bars are closed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-ramps-up-coronavirus-tests-to-500-000-a-week/story-EfQQQcSgtt1ZdlpLOqBZ0L.html
26-03-2020||World||Covid-19 update: London hospitals facing ‘continuous tsunami’ of patients||The streets are empty but hospitals in London are filling up to the extent that health officials describe the registration of new cases as a ‘continuous tsunami’, while the UK-wide deaths mounted to 463 and 9,529 cases – 3,249 of them in London.A new 4,000-bed hospital is coming up near Canary Wharf in east London in the ExCel Centre, called the NHS Nightingale Hospital, to cope with the crisis. Military personnel are involved in setting it up, besides delivering crucial protection equipment to hospitals across the UK.Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents heads of NHS hospital trusts, said on Thursday that hospitals were also grappling with increasing percentage of medical staff reporting sick or isolating due to symptoms of coronavirus.He told the BBC: “They are struggling with the explosion of demand in seriously ill patients. They are saying it’s the number arriving and the speed with which they are arriving and how ill they are. They talk about wave after wave after wave”.“The words that are used to me are that it’s a continuous tsunami…The CEOs are concerned that all that extra capacity is now being used up very, very quickly. We’ve got the surge capacity at the ExCel Centre but this is filling up very quickly.”As the UK’s health infrastructure and personnel combat the invisible enemy, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his colleagues announced that over 5 lakh people had volunteered to help with non-medicals tasks. Thousands of retired doctors, nurses have also re-joined the NHS.Johnson said: “When we launched the appeal (for volunteers) we hoped to get 250,000 over a few days. But I can tell you that in just 24 hours 405,000 people have responded to the call. They will be driving medicines from pharmacies to patients”.“They will be bringing patients home from hospital. Very importantly they’ll be making regular phone calls to check on and support people who are staying on their own at home. And they will be absolutely crucial in the fight against this virus”.Chancellor Rishi Sunak, who, last week announced a multi-billion pound package and the government picking up 80 per cent of the private sector’s wage bill, was due on Thursday to reveal more financial support for the self-employed.The UK parliament closed on Wednesday night after passing legislation arming the government with more powers to deal with the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/london-hospitals-facing-continuous-tsunami-of-patients/story-WIyZGTZqO4tEGlLmhbEltJ.html
26-03-2020||World||Imported Covid-19 cases go up in China as overseas Chinese rush home||China on Thursday reported a second consecutive day of no new domestic coronavirus cases as the country’s epidemic epicentre Hubei province opened its sealed borders after weeks, allowing hundreds of people to step out of the province for the first time in several weeks.If that was a sign of the outbreak weakening in China, imported Covid-19 cases, rose sharply on Wednesday, fuelling fears of a second infection wave returning to China riding on overseas returnees.A total of 67 new cases were reported as of end-Wednesday, up from 47 a day earlier, all of which were from outside, China’s national health commission (NHS) said on Thursday.It brought the total number of imported cases to 541 on the mainland.The total number of cases now stands at 81,285 while the NHC reported a total of 3,287 deaths at the end of Wednesday, up six from the previous day.Following the measures taken by Beijing, Shanghai government announced that starting from this (Thursday) evening, all people entering the city from abroad will be required to undergo a 14-day quarantine to prevent the spread of the infection.Expressing the Chinese government’s concern about overseas cases, the vice foreign minister, Luo Zhaohui said on Thursday that around 90 percent of China’s imported cases of Covid-19 are Chinese passport holders and 40 percent of them were students.The Chinese foreign ministry, its embassies and hotlines have received 70000 phone calls from overseas Chinese on the pandemic, Luo said at a press conference in Beijing.“Effectively curbing the rise of imported Covid-19 cases has become a priority of China’s epidemic prevention and control,” Luo said.The minister urged Chinese overseas students not venture to places with high infection risks and avoid non-essential travel.“We understand some overseas students are eager to come home...But under the current circumstances, by staying put, they can avoid being cross-infected in the hurried journey home or getting stuck mid-journey when the countries they transit in tighten border controls,” Luo said.Planning for a new wave of infections from overseas returnees, Beijing and local authorities in other cities have tightened screening and quarantine measures.Beijing reported six new confirmed Covid-19 cases from other countries Wednesday, bringing the total number of imported cases in Beijing to 149.Three of the new cases are from Britain, with the others from Canada, France and Hungary.By the end of Wednesday, a total of 416 indigenously transmitted cases were reported in the city, of which 392 were discharged from hospitals after recovery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imported-covid-19-cases-go-up-in-china-as-overseas-chinese-rush-home/story-0dZNbvp8vWTVGzl3zuCVCK.html
26-03-2020||World||At G7 meet, Pompeo accuses China of funding Covid-19 ‘disinformation campaign’||US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Wednesday that the Group of Seven powers were united in opposing China’s coronavirus “disinformation,” but European allies emphasized cooperation to fight the global pandemic.Foreign ministers from the major industrialized democracies spoke about the crisis by videoconference, scrapping a meeting scheduled in Pittsburgh, but any hope of showing a common front was eroded by the absence of a joint statement.Pompeo, a sharp critic of Beijing who has gone on the offensive over what he calls the “Wuhan virus,” said he shared a common view with the top diplomats of the other G7 countries -- Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan.“Every one of the nations that were at that meeting this morning was deeply aware of the disinformation campaign that the Chinese Communist Party is engaged in to try and deflect from what has really taken place,” Pompeo told reporters.Pompeo said that China “has been and continues to be engaged in” a social media campaign that has included conspiracy theories of US involvement.“This is crazy talk,” he said.A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman infuriated President Donald Trump’s administration by suggesting on Twitter that US troops brought the virus to Wuhan, the metropolis where it was first detected late last year. A spokesman from China’s foreign ministry said Thursday that China strongly condemned Pompeo’s comments, including his use of the term “Wuhan virus”.“This US politician moves counter to the international consensus and continues to stigmatise China, smearing China’s efforts, trying to use this to shift attention and blame with extremely malicious intent,” said Geng Shuang at a press briefing Thursday.The virus has killed more than 21,000 people globally, but Beijing has appeared to bring it under control and has sent aid overseas -- including 40 tons of medical supplies to US ally Italy, which has the world’s highest death toll.On Wednesday, Pompeo minimized China’s efforts and pointed to a US Air Force cargo plane’s aid delivery to Italy as well as private US charity efforts.China is “now making small sales of product around the world and claiming that they are now the white hat in what has taken place,” Pompeo said.But he also said the United States sought cooperation, including with China. The two countries’ leaders are set to take part in a virtual summit on the crisis Thursday of the Group of 20 major economies.“We desperately want to work with every country around the world. This is a global pandemic,” Pompeo said.- France warns not to ‘exploit’ crisis -German magazine Der Spiegel, quoting anonymous diplomats, said that the joint statement was scuttled by Pompeo’s insistence that it use the term “Wuhan virus” -- a formulation frowned upon by medical professionals who say it is stigmatizing.Pompeo did not deny the report when asked about it, saying that each minister would speak separately but that they had a “common understanding” on the health and economic crisis caused by the “Wuhan virus.”France and Germany issued statements on the G7 talks that made no mention of China. Canada said China was raised in “broader discussions.”French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian “underscored the need to combat any attempt to exploit the crisis for political purposes,” a statement said, in likely a veiled response to Pompeo.Le Drian “expressed the view that the unity of all in order to effectively combat the pandemic must now take precedence over any other considerations,” it said.France called for the G7 to find ways to assist Africa, warning that both the continent’s healthcare system and economies were ill-equipped for the global crisis.Pompeo has accused China of putting the world at risk by initially suppressing news of the virus. Beijing in turn has accused the Trump administration of seeking a scapegoat for its own failures.sct-bys/rox/rma||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pompeo-accuses-china-of-carrying-out-covid-19-disinformation-campaign/story-Kmwju0GZjncKsoeMghLxhL.html
26-03-2020||World||WHO Europe sees ‘encouraging signs’ in coronavirus spread||The World Health Organization’s European office said Thursday it saw “encouraging signs” as Italy reported a lower rate of infections of the new coronavirus, cautioning it was too soon to say whether the worst had passed.“While the situation remains very serious, we are starting to see some encouraging signs,” WHO regional director for Europe, Hans Kluge, told a press conference.“Italy, which has the highest number of cases in the region, has just seen a slightly lower rate of increase, though it is still too early to say that the pandemic is peaking in that country,” he added.WHO Europe said that to date over 220,000 cases of COVID-19 had been reported on the continent, along with 11,987 deaths. That means that globally, roughly six out of every 10 cases and seven out of 10 deaths have been reported in Europe, with the number of confirmed infections worldwide now over 400,000.As the new coronavirus has spread across the continent, many European countries have adopted severe measures to curb the outbreak, including imposing lockdown measures and closing businesses and borders, as well as limiting public gatherings.According to Kluge they will soon be able to determine the degree to which those measures have had an impact.But Kluge also cautioned governments and citizens to be aware of the “new reality” created by the pandemic and prepare for the long term impact. “This is not going to be a sprint, this is going to be a marathon,” Kluge said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-europe-sees-encouraging-signs-in-coronavirus-spread/story-KSerqvUqHbeowX6gbMiEEJ.html
26-03-2020||World||Covid-19 update: China asks Pak to open border for transferring medical aid||China has asked Pakistan to open the border between the two countries for one day on Friday so that medical supplies to fight coronavirus pandemic could be transported into the country, according to a media report.The Khunjerab Pass is usually opened on April 1 which marks the end of winter in that part, but due to the global outbreak of COVID-19, the border between Pakistan and China has been closed for an indefinite period.The Chinese embassy in a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the governor of Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China would like to donate a batch of medical materials to Gilgit-Baltistan, the Dawn reported. According to the letter, the governor has donated 200,000 ordinary face masks, 2,000 N-95 face masks, five ventilators, 2,000 testing kits and 2,000 medical protective clothes mainly used by doctors and paramedics to fight with virus, which originated in China late last year.The donation is in response to a request made by GB Chief Minister Hafeezur Rehman to the governor of Xinjiang region to combat coronavirus in the province.Gilgit-Baltistan has high percentage of coronavirus cases in the country compared to its population, but the underdeveloped region has a negligible number of operational ventilators and remoteness has led to a severe shortage of medical equipment.The province has reported 84 positive cases so far while the national tally has reached to 1,102 and the death toll to eight. Earlier, National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) Chairman Lt Gen Mohammad Afzal had said said Pakistan had sought to purchase medical equipment, including ventilators, but these were in short supply around the world and only China had assured that it would provide such items to Pakistan.Under a border protocol agreement of 1985, the Khunjerab border crossing remains closed from the end of November to April. Trade and travel activities between the two countries take place through Khunjerab Pass, also known as Sust Dry Port – the only land route between China and Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-seeks-opening-of-border-with-pak-to-supply-medical-equipment/story-SAZ09Dup6RMsSWvDJ88lWK.html
26-03-2020||World||Coronavirus could become seasonal, says top US scientist||There is a strong chance the new coronavirus could return in seasonal cycles, a senior US scientist said Wednesday, underscoring the urgent need to find a vaccine and effective treatments. Anthony Fauci, who leads research into infectious diseases at the National Institutes of Health, told a briefing the virus was beginning to take root in the southern hemisphere, where winter is on its way.“What we’re starting to see now... in southern Africa and in the southern hemisphere countries, is that we’re having cases that are appearing as they go into their winter season,” he said.“And if, in fact, they have a substantial outbreak, it will be inevitable that we need to be prepared that we’ll get a cycle around the second time.“It totally emphasizes the need to do what we’re doing in developing a vaccine, testing it quickly and trying to get it ready so that we’ll have a vaccine available for that next cycle.”There are currently two vaccines that have entered human trials -- one in the US and one in China -- and they could be a year to a year-and-a-half away from deployment.Treatments are also being investigated -- some new drugs and others that have been repurposed, including the antimalarials chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine.“I know we’ll be successful in putting this down now, but we really need to be prepared for another cycle,” Fauci concluded.Fauci’s comments suggesting the virus does better in colder weather than it does in hot and humid conditions follows a recent Chinese research paper -- still preliminary and awaiting peer-review -- that reached the same conclusion. The reasons are thought to include that respiratory droplets remain airborne for longer in colder weather, and that cold weather weakens immunity.Another potential reason is that viruses degrade more quickly on hotter surfaces, possibly because a protective layer of fat that envelops them dries out quicker. But reduced infection rate does not mean the virus gets eliminated -- Australia has had almost 2,500 confirmed cases and 8 deaths, for example.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-could-become-seasonal-says-top-us-scientist/story-cmbzNB41lCNX3zZpZ79fFL.html
26-03-2020||World||Italy’s slowing infections boost case for lockdowns||Italy’s coronavirus infections rate slowed for a fourth successive day Wednesday as fresh evidence emerged that long and painful lockdowns against pandemics will work.The latest data from the epicentre of the once-in-a-century outbreak comes with more and more nations weighing whether to shutter their own stores and factories -- and for how long.Analysts at one of the big US investment banks said evidence from Italy this week could determine whether much of the United States “will diverge or follow the Italian trajectory”.Almost everything across the Mediterranean country has been closed for over two weeks.Public gatherings have been banned and much of the economy is set to remain in a state of suspended animation for an indefinite time to come.Analysts think Italy is sliding into its deepest recession in generations as a result.But it is the price Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has decided to pay to slow the spread of a disease that has now killed 7,503 in Italy and infected almost 75,000.“History will judge us,” the increasingly popular Italian leader told parliament on Wednesday.“We must all contribute to the common good,” Conte said. “The government has acted with the utmost determination and speed.” ‘Extremely positive’ Wednesday’s figures showed deaths staying within the high but relative narrow range they had reached at the end of last week.Health officials reported 683 new fatalities and 5,210 infections.The overall rise in daily deaths among confirmed COVID-19 cases slowed to 10 percent.It had been as high as 57 percent when the illness was still spreading exponentially on March 8.The daily infections growth rate fell to a record low of 7.5 percent.The World Health Organization’s deputy director Ranieri Guerra sounded pleased.“The slowdown in the (infections) growth rate is extremely positive,” Guerra told Italy’s Capitale radio.“I think the measures taken (by Italy) are absolutely correct -- perhaps with a certain delay at the start, but that is understandable.”The government-run National Research Council said 57 out of Italy’s 107 provinces have already hit their peak of the virus spread.The numbers are improving “and the containment measures are delivering the desired effect, even if we are in the initial phase of the slowdown,” the research council said.‘Italian trajectory’ Italy’s data are being watched by global policymaker as they weigh the potential health benefits of imposing national lockdowns against their damaging economic side effects.“The next 3-5 days are key to seeing if Italy’s lockdown measures are having an impact and if the US will diverge or follow the Italian trajectory,” the Morgan Stanley investment bank wrote on Tuesday.“We do note, however, that the number of mortalities has slowed from an exponential increase since the lock down began,” the bank said.There were still worrying signs in Italian regions such as Campania around Naples and Rome’s Lazio.Deaths in the Naples region rose from 49 on Monday to 74 on Wednesday.Those in and around Rome went up from 63 to 95 over the same span.And deaths in the northern Piemonte region around the industrial city of Turin rose from 315 on Monday to 449 on Wednesday.The figures for all three regions represent jumps of around 50 percent in two days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-s-slowing-infections-boost-case-for-lockdowns/story-aVDpgHxQY7FEd6XpxvBTTL.html
26-03-2020||World||South African virus carriers charged with attempted murder for not isolating||South African police have charged two men with attempted murder for allegedly continuing to go out after they tested positive for the coronavirus, exposing others to the infection.Police minister Bheki Cele announced the charges on Wednesday during a press conference detailing the enforcement of an incomong lockdown meant to curb the spread of coronavirus.“If you break these laws of regulations you are six months in, or fined, or both,” said Cele.“Two people have been charged already... who deliberately moved around after they were told” not to, he warned.“So it’s not a fairytale to say the law will act and act very harsh on you.” The first case was a 52-year old salon owner diagnosed with coronavirus on March 18 and instructed to quarantine for at least 14 days.Police spokesperson Vish Naidoo said local officials raised the alert on Tuesday after the man was seen around the western city of Ladysmith, in KwaZulu-Natal province.“(He) allegedly continued with his business... and in doing so disregarded the instructions by a doctor,” Naidoo said, adding that the man had since been arrested and taken to hospital.The second charge was filed against a male tourist who tested positive for COVID-19 while on holiday at Kruger National Park.Naidoo said the man ignored instructions to remain in his hotel and went to the nearby town of Saint Lucia, where he interacted “with an unknown number of people”.South Africa has recorded the highest number of coronavirus infections on the continent, with 709 cases confirmed so far.President Cyril Ramaphosa announced a 21-day lockdown after the number of infections multiplied six-fold in just eight days.Only “essential” trips to grocery stores, pharmacies and medical appointments will be permitted during the lockdown, which will be enforced by army troops.“The simplest and best way to combat the spread of the coronavirus is STAY HOME,” the police said in a statement on Wednesday.“It is exactly that stubborn behaviour that has caused us a national lockdown.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-african-virus-carriers-charged-with-attempted-murder-for-not-isolating/story-kiNY2RjvE9yrVRtvywHWNN.html

Khera, who is also a parliamentary secretary in Justin Trudeau’s Government, also received some words of solace from the Canadian Prime Minister, as he responded to her announcement on Twitter, by saying, “Take care of yourself, Kamal. We’re all thinking of you — and hoping you get well soon.” Trudeau himself continues to remain in self-isolation as his wife Sophie Gregoire had earlier tested positive.In a statement, Khera said, “On Saturday night, I began developing flu like symptoms while at home and immediately began self-isolating.”“While I am still experiencing symptoms, I am in good spirits. I know that many Canadians are in much worse circumstances. My thoughts are with all families who have been affected by this public health crisis,” she added.As the Registered Nurses Association of Ontario had sent out a call for former members of the profession to help out at this critical time, Khera had “registered to help ease the nurse shortage.” She had tweeted at that time, “As a RN (Registered Nurse) there couldn’t be a more important time to give back to my community.”While it remains unclear how Khera contracted the virus, the outlet Global News reported that she had met with the United Nations’ World Food Programme chief David Beasley on March 12 and a week later, he had tested positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indo-canadian-mp-kamal-khera-tests-positive-for-covid-19-after-returns-to-nursing-profession/story-s2zlJtaIDNisZezoVmMXOM.html
26-03-2020||World||US deaths top 1,000 as $2.2 trillion in coronavirus aid approved||US deaths from the coronavirus pandemic have topped 1,000, in another grim milestone for a global outbreak that is taking lives and wreaking havoc on economies and established routines of ordinary life.In a recognition of the scale of the threat, the U.S. Senate late Wednesday passed an unparalleled $2.2 trillion economic rescue package steering aid to businesses, workers and health care systems.The unanimous vote came despite misgivings on both sides about whether it goes too far or not far enough and capped days of difficult negotiations as Washington confronted a national challenge unlike it has ever faced. The 880-page measure is the largest economic relief bill in U.S. history.Worldwide, the death toll climbed past 21,000, according to a running count kept by Johns Hopkins University. The number of dead in the U.S. rose to 1,041 as of late Wednesday, with nearly 70,000 infections.Spain’s death toll has risen past 3,400, eclipsing that of China where the virus was first detected in December, after a one-day spike of 700 fatalities. Spain’s count is now second only to that of Italy, with over 7,500 deaths. Lidia Perera, a nurse at Madrid’s 1,000-bed Hospital de la Paz, said more workers were desperately needed. “We are collapsing,” Perera said.The Spanish parliament voted to allow the government extend strict stay-at-home rules and business closings until April 11.Such measures are becoming increasingly common in the U.S., where New York is the current epicenter of the domestic outbreak, accounting for more than 30,000 cases and close to 300 deaths, most of them in New York City.Public health officials in the city hunted down beds and medical equipment and put out a call for more doctors and nurses for fear the number of sick will explode in a matter of weeks, overwhelming hospitals as has happened in Italy and Spain.A makeshift morgue was set up outside Bellevue Hospital, and the city’s police, their ranks dwindling as more fall ill, were told to patrol nearly empty streets to enforce social distancing.In Washington, President Donald Trump has called for Americans to dedicate themselves for 15 days to social distancing, including staying home from work and closing bars and restaurants to help try to stall the spread of the disease.Yet, he’s also grumbled that “our country wasn’t built to be shut down” and vowed not to allow “the cure be worse than the problem” — apparently concerned that the the outbreak’s devastating effects on financial markets and employment will harm his chances for re-election later this year.“The LameStream Media is the dominant force in trying to get me to keep our Country closed as long as possible in the hope that it will be detrimental to my election success,” Trump tweeted Wednesday.Democrats say that Trump was prioritizing the economy over the health and safety of Americans.“I’d like to say, let’s get back to work next Friday,” said Joe Biden, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination. ”That’d be wonderful. But it can’t be arbitrary.”Biden said the congressional aid package addressing the outbreak “goes a long way,” but that “meticulous oversight” is required.“We’re going to need to make sure the money gets out quickly into peoples’ pockets and to keep a close watch on how corporations are using the taxpayers funds that they receive, to make sure it goes to help workers, not rich CEOs or shareholders,” the former vice president said.Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro has also called to reopen schools and businesses, dismissing his argument that the “cure” of widespread shutdowns to contain the spread of the coronavirus is worse than the disease.Bolsonaro contends that a clampdown already ordered by many governors will deeply wound the beleaguered economy and spark social unrest. In a nationally televised address Tuesday night, he urged governors to limit isolation only to high-risk people and lift the strict anti-virus measures they have imposed in their regions.The country’s governors protested on Wednesday that his instructions run counter to health experts’ recommendations and endanger Latin America’s largest population. They said they would continue with their strict measures in place. The rebellion even included traditional allies of Brazil’s far-right president.Meanwhile, the governor of a state in central Mexico said the poor are “immune” to the coronavirus pandemic, even as the federal government suspended all non-essential government activities in a bid to prevent the spread of the virus.Puebla Gov. Miguel Barbosa’s comment Wednesday was apparently partly a response to statistics showing that the wealthy who travel much more have made up a significant percentage of Mexicans infected to date, including some prominent businessmen. The country has seen six deaths so far.“The majority are wealthy people. If you are rich, you are at risk. If you are poor, no,” Barbosa said. “We poor people, we are immune.”Barbosa also appeared to be playing on an old stereotype held by some Mexicans that poor sanitation standards may have strengthened their immune systems by exposing them to bacteria or other bugs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-deaths-top-1-000-as-2-2-trillion-in-coronavirus-aid-approved/story-2ierYrus9UwkvkokDufBHN.html

As the question lingered, Spain’s death toll surpassed that of China, where the virus surfaced late last year. Meanwhile, to mitigate a fallout of the pandemic, the US Senate and the White House reached an agreement on a $2 trillion stimulus package for the US economy, and to help the millions of Americans ravaged by the situation.

26-03-2020||World||US set to go for $2 trillion stimulus to boost economy||The Trump administration struck a deal with Senate Democrats and Republicans on an historic rescue package with more than $2 trillion in spending and tax breaks to bolster the hobbled U.S. economy and fund a nationwide effort to stem the coronavirus.“At last we have a deal,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said early Wednesday on the chamber’s floor. “I’m thrilled that we’re finally going to deliver to the country.”Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, who engaged in marathon negotiations with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, called it an “outstanding agreement.”The legislation was still being drafted and there were few details on all the provisions agreed to, especially related to the specific terms of the bailout and loan terms for companies.Lawmakers are awaiting a final text of the bill ahead of a vote that McConnell promised would be held later Wednesday.It would still have to pass in the House before it gets to President Donald Trump’s desk. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who had consulted with Schumer throughout the negotiations, has previously indicated she would act to move the bill quickly.“This bipartisan legislation takes us a long way down the road in meeting the needs of the American people,” Pelosi said in a statement Wednesday. “House Democrats will now review the final provisions and legislative text of the agreement to determine a course of action.”The outline of the plan includes about $500 billion that can be used to back loans and assistance to companies, including $50 billion for loans to U.S. airlines, as well as state and local governments. It also has more than $350 billion to aid small businesses. Then there is $150 billion for hospitals and other health-care providers for equipment and supplies.Direct PaymentsFor individuals the package provides direct payments to lower- and middle-income Americans of $1,200 for each adult, as well as $500 for each child. Unemployment insurance would be extended to four months, the benefits would be bolstered by $600 weekly and eligibility would be expanded to cover more workers.The bill provides a tax credit for companies who retain employees even if they’ve been mandated to close or seen a significant drop-off in business. Student loan borrowers who get assistance from their employers on paying those back don’t have to pay income tax on the aid.Democrats demanded and won a series of restraints on corporations that would benefit from loans or investments from the Treasury Department, as well as an oversight mechanism for who gets money.Any company receiving a government loan would be subject to a ban on stock buybacks through the term of the loan plus one additional year. They also would have to limit executive bonuses and take steps to protect workers. The Treasury Department would have to disclose the terms of loans or other aid to companies and a new Treasury inspector general would oversee the lending program.Notably, Democrats won language that would bar any business owned by Trump or his family from getting loans from Treasury. Businesses owned by members of Congress, heads of executive departments and Vice President Mike Pence also would be blocked.With the prospect that Congress was closing in on a deal Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose more than 11% in its biggest advance since 1933, and the S&P 500 rebounded with the biggest one-day gain since October 2008 after starting the week with a rout. In Asia markets, U.S. futures pared early losses after news of the deal.In a letter to his fellow Democrats, Schumer highlighted a series of transparency measures that would prevent keeping loans secret and create a new inspector general to oversee the program.Schumer also said that hundreds of billions would be spent on Democratic priorities, including the expansion of unemployment benefits, money for hospitals as well as more funding for cities and transportation.Democrats also rejected the $3 billion sought by the Trump administration to buy oil to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.Pelosi said on Tuesday that the House could quickly approve a Senate-passed coronavirus stimulus with a voice vote that doesn’t require members to travel to Washington -- as long as the bill does not have any “poison pills” Democrats object to.That would also require the unanimous consent of all House Republicans. The second-ranking House Republican, Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, told his vote-counting team during a conference call Tuesday night that the best option is to accept a Senate-passed economic stimulus bill, according to Scalise spokeswoman Lauren Fine.Eric Ueland, the White House legislative affairs director, said after the agreement was reached that the “the president and his team look forward to swift action for urgently needed assistance to the American people and powerful aid to the nation’s economy as we work through this crisis.”The size of the stimulus package is unprecedented, dwarfing the approximately $800 billion Obama stimulus that passed five months after the 2008 financial crash.Together with Fed intervention, the proposed legislation amounted to a $6 trillion stimulus, according to White House economic adviser Larry Ludlow, or about 30% of annual GDP.The package will likely more than double a U.S budget deficit that was already set to hit $1 trillion this year before the outbreak. It also may not be the last infusion of government spending in response to the spread of the virus.Lawmakers universally expressed a sense of urgency as the nation’s economy deteriorates and the health outlook grows more dire. The World Health Organization said the U.S. has the potential to become the new epicenter of the global pandemic as the number of known infections soars.The proposal is the third -- and biggest -- plan by Congress to confront the coronavirus crisis as the disease spreads.An initial $8 billion plan passed by Congress March 5 is funding emergency health care needs stemming from the coronavirus, and a second plan enacted last week will provide many Americans with paid sick leave, food assistance and free coronavirus testing. It also will send tens of billions in fresh aid to states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-go-for-2-trillion-stimulus-to-boost-economy/story-W8CwqKbYH3oYao8gaunXBK.html
26-03-2020||World||Global coronavirus death toll crosses 20,000, three billion under lockdown||More than three billion people around the world were living under lockdown on Wednesday as governments stepped up their efforts against the coronavirus pandemic which has left more than 20,000 people dead.As the number of confirmed cases worldwide soared past 450,000, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned that only a concerted global effort could stop the spread of the virus.In Spain, the number of fatalities surpassed those of China, where the novel coronavirus first emerged three months ago, making it the hardest-hit nation after Italy.A total of more than 20,800 deaths have now been reported in 182 countries and territories, according to an AFP tally.Stock markets rebounded after the US Congress moved closer to passing a $2.2 trillion relief package to prop up a teetering US economy.In Washington, President Donald Trump said New York, the epicenter of the US outbreak with over 30,000 cases, likely has a few “tough weeks” ahead but he would decide soon whether unaffected parts of the country can get back to work.“We want to get our country going again,” Trump said. “I’m not going to do anything rash or hastily.“By Easter we’ll have a recommendation and maybe before Easter,” said Trump, who had been touting a strong US economy as he faces an election in November.UN chief Guterres said the world needs to ban together to stem the pandemic.“COVID-19 is threatening the whole of humanity -- and the whole of humanity must fight back,” Guterres said, launching an appeal for $2 billion to help the world’s poor.“Global action and solidarity are crucial,” he said. “Individual country responses are not going to be enough.”- Two deaths in Russia -India’s stay-at-home order for its 1.3 billion people is now the biggest, taking the total number of individuals facing restrictions on their daily lives to more than three billion.Anxious Indians raced for supplies after the world’s second-biggest population was ordered not to leave their houses for three weeks.Russia, which announced the death of two patients who tested positive for coronavirus on Wednesday, is expected to follow suit.President Vladimir Putin declared next week a public holiday and postponed a public vote on controversial constitutional reforms, urging people to follow instructions given by authorities.In Britain, heir to the throne Prince Charles became the latest high-profile figure to be infected, though he has suffered only mild symptoms.The G20 major economies will hold an emergency videoconference on Thursday to discuss a global response to the crisis, as will the 27 leaders of the European Union, the outbreak’s new epicenter.China has begun to relax its own draconian restrictions on free movement in the province of Hubei -- where the outbreak began in December -- after the country reported no new cases.Crowds jammed trains and buses in the province as people took their first opportunity to travel.But Spain saw the number of deaths surge to more than 3,400 after 738 people died in the past 24 hours and the government announced a 432-million-euro ($467 million) deal to buy medical supplies from Beijing.The death toll in Italy jumped in 24 hours by 683 to 7,503 -- by far the highest of any country.The number of French deaths was up by 231 on Wednesday to more than 1,330, and metro and rail services in Paris were cut to a minimum.Spain and Italy were joined by France and six more EU countries in urging Germany and the Netherlands to allow the issue of joint European bonds to cut borrowing costs and stabilise the eurozone economy.The call is likely to fall on deaf ears when EU leaders talk on Thursday -- with northern members wary of pooling debt with big spenders -- but they will sign off on an “unprecedented” recovery plan.- ‘People dying alone’ -At La Paz University Hospital in Madrid, nurse Guillen del Barrio sounded bereft as he related what happened overnight.“It is really hard, we had feverish people for many hours in the waiting room,” the 30-year-old told AFP.“Many of my colleagues were crying because there were people who are dying alone, without seeing their family for the last time.”Coronavirus cases are also spreading in the Middle East, where Iran’s death toll topped 2,000, and in Africa, where Mali declared its first case and several nations announced states of emergency.In Japan, which has postponed this year’s Olympic Games, Tokyo’s governor urged residents to stay home this weekend, warning of a possible “explosion” of the coronavirus.Jerusalem’s Church of the Holy Sepulchre, believed by Christians to house Christ’s tomb, was shut as Israel tightened movement restrictions.The impact of the pandemic is also hitting European football, with leagues and tournaments cancelled, while the fate of the Wimbledon tennis tournament could be decided next week.The economic damage of the virus -- and the lockdowns -- could also be devastating, with fears of a worldwide recession worse than the financial meltdown more than a decade ago.But financial markets rose after US leaders reached agreement on a stimulus package worth roughly 10 percent of the US economy, an injection Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said represented a “wartime level of investment.”Meanwhile, more than half of all Americans have been told to stay at home, including residents of the largest state, California.The United States has at least 65,700 cases and 942 people have died.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-death-toll-crosses-20-000-three-billion-under-lockdown/story-20O4ateTX10DR1Wq5TnRcO.html
26-03-2020||World||Coronavirus update: Chaos after Hubei’s lockdown ends||Wuhan, the epicentre of the pandemic, on Wednesday resumed bus services within the city for the first time since the start of the nine-week lockdown even as 47 new imported cases were reported from the country.China on Tuesday decided to lift the lockdown on more than 56 million people in Hubei province. The lockdown of Hubei’s capital Wuhan will end on April 8.Huge crowds jammed trains and buses in Hubei on Wednesday as people seized their first chance to travel after two months. Strict curbs on daily life are being lifted, allowing people to head home and see loved ones after weeks of separation.While the province did not report any new Covid-19 case, four people died in the city taking the death toll in China to 3,281.

26-03-2020||World||British parliament okays emergency Covid-19 legislation||Britain’s upper house on Wednesday approved emergency legislation designed to help the Boris Johnson government tackle the coronavirus outbreak, paving the way for the far-reaching bill to become law.The laws will create temporary powers across different areas, from giving police and immigration officers the ability to detain people to protect public health, to allowing people to leave their jobs to volunteer in the health service.Having been approved by parliament’s elected lower house earlier this week, the bill now only requires the rubber stamp of ‘Royal Assent’ before it officially becomes law. This is expected by Thursday, and could come earlier.UK’s Retired medics return to fight virusThousands of retired doctors and nurses have returned “to the front line” to deal with the coronavirus challenge, besides nearly 19,000 final-year medical students, as the UK grapples with staff and equipment shortage in the fight against Covid-19.The UK has reported 8,077 cases and at leat 422 deaths so far.A call for volunteers to perform non-medical tasks in the UK’s National Health Service was immediately responded to by over 170,000 people within 24 hours. However, reports suggest that the massive NHS recruitment drive risks being undermined by the prospect of doctors quitting over fears of inadequate protective equipment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-parliament-okays-emergency-covid-19-legislation/story-g0HyTVg9tqJDO1ZJQbDYUN.html
26-03-2020||World||Vienna funerals go online amid coronavirus fears||Vienna funeral homes said Wednesday they are now offering to stream ceremonies online after the government restricted gatherings and travel to stem the COVID-19 outbreak.Only up to five people are allowed to gather at a time, and movement has been strictly limited in Austria since last week as countries around the world fight to contain the virus.Himmelblau, Vienna’s largest privately owned funeral home, has begun offering live stream of ceremonies since Friday, according to director Jacob Homan.Six funerals have since been sent out, and more customers are interested in the free service, Homan said.“It is difficult for many of the next-of-kin that they cannot attend the funeral,” he told AFP.The funeral is filmed on a mobile phone and broadcast via the Zoom platform, which is secured by a password.Customers also get the video to share with others later if they wish.“Travel bans and the strict measures render it impossible at times to bid the final farewell,” noted Nina Laemmermayer, a spokeswoman for Bestattung und Friedhoefe Wien, which has also started to offer online streaming of ceremonies.“The new service makes it possible for those left, especially those who are in high-risk groups, to take part in the funeral and ‘be there’ without any risks,” she added.The country of nine million people has reported more than 5,500 new coronavirus cases so far, including 31 deaths.Similar services are now also being offered elsewhere, such as France and Spain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vienna-funerals-go-online-amid-coronavirus-fears/story-4X1pJp66IIVxC8W5zkHbdK.html
26-03-2020||World||Coronavirus update: New York state, California bear the brunt||India-born celebrity chef Floyd Cordoz died of complications from Covid-19 in New York City, the epicentre of the pandemic in the US, as authorities ramped up medical supplies in the city and asked those who left it recently to self-quarantine for 14 days.Cordoz, the culinary director of Mumbai’s Bombay Canteen and NewYork’s Tabla, died in a hospital where he had been under treatment since March 18. He had returned to the city from Mumbai earlier this month. More than 800 people have died from Covid-19 in the US so far and some 60,000 people have tested positive. The surge in cases has prompted the WHO to warn that the US could potentially be the next epicentre of the outbreak.New York City has been hit the hardest with more than 15,000 confirmed cases and nearly 200 deaths. America’s most populous city accounts for 56% of all US cases, 60% of all new cases and 31% of mortality. As a consequence, the state of New York is the worst affected among the 50 states, with 30,811 confirmed cases and 285 deaths, followed by California. It is feared that, with 2,643 cases and 55 deaths, the West Coast state could be the next hot spot. Washington, another state on the West Coast, reported 2,469 cases and 123 deaths.“We’re still on the way up the mountain,” New York governor Andrew Cuomo said at his daily briefing on Wednesday. Both the NY state and New York City are facing an acute shortage of medical supplies including hospital beds and ventilators. Cuomo has said the state needs upwards of 140,000 beds and currently has around 50,000 and is way short of ventilators. The government has sent four mobile hospitals with thousands of beds and is moving a US navy hospital ship also; likewise for ventilators, 4,000 on the way from the national stockpile.New York’s medical facilities are under unprecedented pressure with new coronavirus infections doubling every three days, Cuomo said. NYC hospitals have seen a 10-fold increase in positive cases, officials have said. US authorities are now also focusing on preventing New Yorkers fleeing to safety elsewhere in the country and people who travelled to New York City recently from spreading the virus. “For anyone in the New York metropolitan area who has travelled, our task force is encouraging you to monitor your temperature, be sensitive to symptoms,” vice-president Mike Pence, who heads the Trump administration’s coronavirus task force, said at a briefing. “And we are asking anyone who has travelled out of the New York City metropolitan area to anywhere else in the country to self isolate for 14 days.”Two leading medical experts on the task force had first made that case at the briefing, citing high incidence of new cases and the danger of travellers and New Yorkers leaving city for their own safety, carrying it to other areas. And that there have been cases that suggested infected people have left the city.Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease and a member of the task force, added that self-isolation for these people was necessary “because we don’t want that to be another seeding point to the rest of the country, wherever they go”.Stay-at-home orders are in effect in 17 states, covering 175 million people - more than a third of the population of the US - to slow down the spread of the coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-new-york-state-california-bear-the-brunt/story-gSy0jO1MK01x6ps72zM4AM.html
