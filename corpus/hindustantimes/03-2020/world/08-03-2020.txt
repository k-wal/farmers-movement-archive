She has frequently figured in speculation about Biden’s pick for running mate should he win the nomination.“I have decided that I am with great enthusiasm going to endorse Joe Biden for president of the United States,” Harris, the first Indian American (she is also part African American) ever elected to US senate, said in a video message. “I believe in Joe. I really believe in him, and I have known him for a long time.”“There is no one better prepared than Joe to steer our nation through these turbulent times, and restore truth, honor, and decency to the Oval Office. He is kind and endlessly caring, and he truly listens to the American people.” Harris ended her White House run in December.The former vice-president has been on a roll since his thumping victory in the South Carolina primaries, which he capped with a landslide in the Super Tuesday nomination contests last week, picking up 10 of the 14 states on the ballot. Senator Bernie Sanders took the rest four in what is now a two-man race. Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard is still there but with no real path to the nomination. She has not won a single primary yet.On Saturday, the Biden campaign unveiled plans to spent $12 million on ads ahead of the upcoming nominating contests on March 10 and March 17.Harris’s endorsement was the sixth from Biden’s erstwhile rivals, including Senator Amy Klobuchar, former Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former congressman Beto O’Rourke and billionaire Michael Bloomberg in recent days and is being seen as a consolidation of moderates in the party.Speculation about Biden’s running-mate has picked up steam as well. He has not named names, but indicated last August he could pick someone “of color and/or a different gender”. Harris has been on a list of those he could select, along with Stacy Abrams, who shot to national celebrity in 2018 as a candidate for governor in Georgia. Others in the changing list include Klobuchar and former deputy attorney general Sally Yates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-endorses-joe-biden-for-democratic-presidential-nomination/story-83KG5RGDQd0ZJE184cOsSO.html

A total of 57,065 in the mainland have recovered from covid-19, officials said. By the end of Saturday, 63 “imported” cases of the disease had been reported.The trend of falling cases comes in the backdrop of a top Chinese epidemiologist saying that ground zero Wuhan, under a total lockdown since January 23, was coming out of its “darkest moment” in the outbreak. Zeng Guang, chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention said Wuhan is emerging from its darkest period of the ongoing outbreak and other Chinese cities were making progress as well.Cities in Hubei are catching up with other regions in the country in curbing the virus spread, and Wuhan is “coming out of the darkest moment”, he was quoted as saying by state media. Epidemic prevention work has been categorised into three parts nationwide: Wuhan, other cities in Hubei, and other regions in the country. Soon, it will only be divided into Wuhan and other places outside Wuhan, the expert said.Meanwhile, at least 49 people were rescued until Sunday morning from under the debris of a hotel that collapsed in Quanzhou city of eastern China’s Fujian province. The hotel was being used as a quarantine facility for close contacts of people infected with covid-19. At least 70 persons were said to be trapped after the hotel collapsed on Saturday evening. Officials are yet to give a reason for why the hotel collapsed.The Chinese government, meanwhile, has decided to donate US $20 million to the World Health Organisation (WHO) to support it carry out international cooperation in fighting the outbreak of the novel coronavirus.“Currently, the world is facing an escalating urgency to make global efforts in the joint prevention and control of the COVID-19, as the disease has broke out in multiple places and spread to more countries around the world,” Chinese state media said.“As a response to the WHO’s appeal, the donation is practical support for the organisation to continue playing a better coordinating role in the global fight against the epidemic, especially in helping medium and small-sized countries with weak public health systems cement their defence against the outbreak,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-epicentre-wuhan-out-of-dark-moment-says-expert-as-cases-in-china-fall/story-7WeOovdxxaDHAQ0T5E8RrL.html
08-03-2020||World||Quarter of Italians on lockdown as virus sweeps globe||A quarter of the Italian population was locked down Sunday as the government takes drastic steps to stop the spread of the deadly new coronavirus that is sweeping the globe, with Latin America recording its first fatality.Italy has seen the most deaths from the COVID-19 disease of any country outside China, where the outbreak that has now killed more than 3,500 people and infected over 100,000 worldwide began in December.The measures in place until April 3 bar people from entering or leaving vast areas of northern Italy without good reason, according to a decree signed by the prime minister and published online.The quarantine zones are home to more than 15 million people and include the regions around Venice and financial capital Milan, while cinemas, theatres and museums will be closed nationwide.It comes as Argentina on Saturday became the first Latin American country to report a fatality from the virus that has affected 95 nations and territories. Anxious passengers aboard a virus-hit US cruise ship were confined to their cabins in waters off San Francisco, after 21 people tested positive for the disease.The contagion has already spread to 30 US states, killing at least 19 people, with New York announcing a state of emergency.The Grand Princess ship was given permission late Saturday to dock in Oakland. Vice President Mike Pence, who is in charge of the US response to the outbreak, said earlier that all 3,533 passengers and crew would be tested for coronavirus and quarantined if necessary.Meanwhile another cruise ship, the Costa Fortuna, was turned away by Malaysia and Thailand due to virus fears, an official said Sunday. The boat is carrying around 2,000 people, including dozens of Italians.- ‘Sombre moment’ -The World Health Organization described worldwide virus cases passing the 100,000-mark as a “sombre moment”.However in China, the number of new cases reported Sunday nationwide was the lowest in weeks, with nearly all 44 of them in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province and epicentre of the outbreak.The government has hinted it may soon lift the quarantine imposed on Hubei, where some 56 million people have been effectively housebound since late January.The only infections in China beyond Hubei were imported from abroad, including arrivals from Italy and Spain in Beijing.The WHO said the efforts of China and other countries were “demonstrating that spread of the virus can be slowed” with the path of the disease even “reversed through the implementation of robust containment and control activities”.As recorded deaths in Italy soared to 233 on Saturday, the Vatican announced Pope Francis’s Angelus prayer -- normally delivered by the 83-year-old pontiff from his window -- would be broadcast as a livestream.Italy has the world’s second-oldest population after Japan, according to the World Bank, and elderly people appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill from the virus.Retired doctors are being recruited to bolster the Italian healthcare system, while civil protection officials say Lombardy region is having trouble finding beds in hospitals.- Global spread - Colombia, Costa Rica, Malta, the Maldives, Bulgaria and Paraguay have also announced their first cases.The number of infections in South Korea passed 7,000 on Saturday -- the highest in the world outside China.Iran’s 21 new deaths from the epidemic and 1,076 fresh cases reported Saturday brought the overall tolls there to 145 dead and 5,823 infected.The virus has hit international business, tourism, and sports events, with almost 300 million students sent home worldwide as schools and universities close.The Scotland-France women’s rugby match scheduled for Saturday in Glasgow was postponed after a Scottish player tested positive for the coronavirus, Scottish Rugby said.Organisers of the Barcelona marathon on Saturday postponed the event, which had been scheduled for March 15, until October 25.And in Canada, the International Ice Hockey Federation called off the Women’s World Ice Hockey Championships, which had been set to run from March 31 to April 10.Saudi Arabia reopened an area in Mecca’s Grand Mosque, Islam’s holiest site, after suspending the year-long umra pilgrimage during which worshippers circle the Kaaba seven times.However, access to the Kaaba is still blocked and the Grand Mosque is being sterilised.ach-tjx/amj/fox RCS MEDIAGROUP||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/quarter-of-italians-on-lockdown-as-virus-sweeps-globe/story-prp4yRigKzA2JBLf9QhwlI.html
08-03-2020||World||China quarantine hotel collapse kills four||At least four people were killed following the collapse of a hotel used as a coronavirus quarantine facility in eastern China, the Ministry of Emergency Management said Sunday.Rescuers have also retrieved 38 survivors from the rubble, with five in critical or serious condition, out of 71 initially trapped, the ministry said.The coastal city of Quanzhou has recorded 47 cases of the COVID-19 infection and the hotel had been repurposed to house people who had been in recent contact with confirmed patients, the People’s Daily state newspaper reported.Footage circulating on Twitter-like Weibo showed rescue workers searching the ruins of the Xinjia hotel in the dark as they reassured a woman trapped under heavy debris and carried wounded victims to ambulances.Other footage published by local media, purportedly from security cameras across the street, showed the entire hotel collapsing in seconds.The building’s facade appeared to have crumbled into the ground, exposing the structure’s steel frame, and a crowd gathered as the evening wore on.State broadcaster CCTV had earlier reported 48 people had been rescued out of 67 initially trapped when the hotel -- which opened two years ago -- collapsed.The building’s first floor has been undergoing renovation since before the Lunar New Year, and construction workers called the hotel’s owner minutes before the collapse to report a deformed pillar, the official Xinhua news agency said.The building’s owner has been summoned by police, according to Xinhua.China is no stranger to building collapses and deadly construction accidents that are typically blamed on the country’s rapid growth leading to corner-cutting by builders and the widespread flouting of safety rules.At least 20 people died in 2016 when a series of crudely-constructed multi-storey buildings packed with migrant workers collapsed in the eastern city of Wenzhou.Another 10 were killed last year in Shanghai after the collapse of a commercial building during renovations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-quarantine-hotel-collapse-kills-four/story-hX3TiVqeVR6FI4VuElmiDK.html

08-03-2020||World||China reports 27 new deaths, lowest rise in coronavirus cases since January||China on Sunday reported its lowest number of new coronavirus infections since January, with nearly all the 44 new cases in the outbreak epicentre Wuhan.There were 27 new deaths from the virus, all in Wuhan and the lowest in more than a month, bringing the nationwide toll to 3,097, according to the National Health Commission.Only three cases, all imported from abroad, were reported outside of Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital, in Beijing and the northwest province of Gansu.New infections reported from Hubei have been on a downward trend for several weeks and multiple cities in the province have reported zero new cases in recent days.A senior government official hinted on Friday that China may soon lift the lockdown on the province imposed in late January, which has effectively restricted the movement of some 56 million people in Hubei.Nationwide new infections have also been on a downward trend, but confirmed imported cases have prompted fears in recent days that infections could swell as people get infected overseas.The two cases reported in Beijing Sunday were arrivals from Italy and Spain, the capital’s health commission said.The number of coronavirus cases has risen worldwide to more than 100,000, with 3,500 dead across 95 nations and territories.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-reports-27-new-deaths-lowest-rise-in-coronavirus-cases-since-january/story-dnCCl5528p8ni8vJ3WemyI.html
08-03-2020||World||New York declares emergency as coronavirus infects 89 individuals||Two more people succumbed to the novel coronavirus in Washington state, officials said on Saturday, bringing the nationwide toll to 19, while the number of confirmed cases in New York rose to 89 and a cruise ship with infected passengers remained stranded outside San Francisco.More than half of all US states have reported cases of the coronavirus, which originated in China last year and causes the sometimes deadly respiratory illness COVID-19. As the outbreak takes root, daily life has become increasingly disrupted, with concerts and conferences canceled and universities telling students to stay home and take classes online.Organizers of the Conservative Political Action Conference, a high-profile annual gathering that took place in Maryland last month, said on Saturday one of their attendees had tested positive for the virus after exposure prior to the event. The person had no interactions with President Donald Trump or Vice President Mike Pence, who were in attendance, the American Conservative Union said in a statement.The two latest deaths were in Washington’s King County, the hardest hit area in the United States after the virus spread among residents at a nursing facility in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland. The first deaths on the East Coast were announced late Friday, with two people succumbing in Florida.In New York, the number of confirmed cases rose by 13 on Saturday to a statewide total of 89 people, Governor Andrew Cuomo said. He issued a declaration of emergency.“It allows expedited purchasing and expedited hiring, which is what we need right now,” Cuomo told a news conference. Kansas, Missouri and Washington DC announced their first cases. In international waters off California, passengers on a cruise ship that was barred from docking in San Francisco after some aboard tested positive for the novel coronavirus did not know on Saturday when they might be able to step ashore.Trump said on Friday he would prefer the Grand Princess’s 2,400 passengers and 1,100 crew remain out at sea, but that he would let others decide where she should dock.After 19 crew and two passengers out of 46 tested on the Grand Princess were found to have the virus, Pence said the ocean liner will be taken to an unspecified non-commercial port where everyone on board will be tested again, and that those “who need to be quarantined will be quarantined” and those who need medical care will receive it.US officials also began tracking another cruise ship that may have shared crew with the Grand Princess or the Diamond Princess, another ship where the coronavirus spread onboard, Pence said.One Grand Princess passenger described a dull and sometimes queasy wait for news of when their limbo would end.“It bugs me that my relatives in the Bay Area know what’s going to happen with us before I do,” Elizabeth Aleteanu of Colorado Springs said in an interview conducted via Facebook.She turned 35 on Wednesday in a small, windowless cabin shared with her husband and two young children, where the rocking of the vessel sometimes left her nauseated.“The cruise director and staff called my phone and sang happy birthday,” she wrote. “They delivered a princess notebook, birthday card, set of dominoes and a flower arrangement to my cabin. I’m not sure that we’re getting off today. It’s a big flower arrangement ... makes me think we’ll be on board for a hot minute.”The ship’s captain had addressed passengers earlier to say he did not know when they could dock, and that one guest who was critically ill on Friday was taken off the ship, Aleteanu said. The ship has increased its offering of television programs to help passengers pass the time, she said.The predicament of the Grand Princess was reminiscent of the Diamond Princess cruise liner, also owned by Carnival Corp, the world’s leading cruise operator. It was quarantined off Japan in February and was for a time the largest concentration of coronavirus cases outside China.Stephen Hahn, the commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration, told a news conference at the White House on Saturday that a total of 2.1. million coronavirus tests will have been shipped to non-public labs by Monday, as the Trump administration aims to counter criticism that its response to the disease has been sluggish.Hahn said the focus is on getting tests to the highest risk areas in Washington state and California.Multiple manufacturers will soon send millions more tests, he said. “What they told us is they believe they could scale up by the end of next week ... for the capacity for 4 million additional tests that could be shipped,” Hahn said.The respiratory illness has spread to more than 90 countries, killing more than 3,400 people and infecting more than 100,000 worldwide.The economic damage has also intensified and stock markets have continued to tumble. To mitigate against the virus, some banks in New York are dividing their teams of traders between central locations and secondary sites in New Jersey and Connecticut, according to sources familiar with the matter.Goldman Sachs Group Inc had a scare this past week when an employee at its Lower Manhattan offices told the bank he had been at a temple service in a city suburb with a lawyer who later tested positive for the coronavirus. The bank said the employee was sent home and has been under self-quarantine since then “out of an abundance of caution.”The employee, however, did not have contact with the lawyer at the service and has not shown any signs of illness, the bank said. He is expected to return to work next week when it would have been two weeks since he attended the service. Goldman also cleaned the floor on which he worked at its headquarters. All floors remained operational, though Goldman let employees who felt uncomfortable work remotely, it said.“We have no confirmed cases of employees who have contracted COVID-19 and all our buildings are fully operational,” the bank said.

08-03-2020||World||Refugee shelter burns as Greece rolls out new asylum restrictions||A fire engulfed a refugee shelter on the island of Lesbos as Greece announced further restrictions towards asylum seekers in response to a migration surge enabled by Turkey.The fire on Saturday at One Happy Family, a Swiss-operated family care centre for refugees just outside the island capital, came after violence at the weekend directed at aid groups and journalists on Lesbos.“The school building has a lot of damage, we can’t say more at the moment,” a source among the operators told AFP.“The fire brigade is there, our team on the ground as well,” they added.There were no immediate reports of injuries.Over 1,700 migrants have landed on Lesbos and four other Aegean islands from Turkey over the past week, adding to the 38,000 already crammed into abysmal and overstretched refugee centres.The new surge has ramped up already high tensions on Lesbos, an island that has been on the migration frontline for years.Frustration exploded into violence last weekend with mobs setting up roadblocks, attacking cars carrying NGO workers and beating journalists.Earlier Saturday, the Greek migration minister announced plans for two new camps to house asylum-seekers who arrived after March 1, when Turkey announced it would no longer prevent people from trying to cross into the European Union.On the land border with Turkey, tens of thousands of asylum-seekers have been trying to break through for a week.There have been numerous exchanges of tear gas and stones with Greek riot police.Turkey has accused Greece of injuring many migrants and killing at least five, a claim Athens denies.“We want to build two closed centres in (the northern region of) Serres and the greater Athens area with 1,000 places,” migration minister Notis Mitarachi told Skai TV.“We need the backing of local communities. We cannot leave all (these) people on the islands,” he said.Mitarachi also said state support for refugees would be drastically reduced, and that they would be asked to leave camps after securing protected status.“Accommodation and benefits for those granted asylum will be interrupted within a month. From then on, they will have to work for a living. This makes our country a less attractive destination for migration flows,” the minister said.Far-right militants from other parts of Europe have travelled to Lesbos and the Greek border with Turkey, among them Swedish far-right leader Jimmie Akesson, who reportedly handed out flyers at Edirne with the message “Sweden is full”.On Friday, two Germans and two Austrians -- identified as hardline nationalists by local media -- told police they had been attacked and beaten on the central Lesbos market.One of the four, who claimed they were journalists, was identified as Mario Mueller, a German member of the far-right Identitarian Movement.On Saturday, anti-fascist activists organised a gathering in support of refugees on Lesbos.“We need to react in some way because we’ve reached a point where fear is taking hold,” said Maria Psomadaki, a retired teacher.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/refugee-shelter-burns-as-greece-rolls-out-new-asylum-restrictions/story-5LZkPPBVOHx9f2mEvGLiKK.html

He had been in intensive care since being admitted to a public hospital Wednesday.Officials said the man was not one of the eight confirmed COVID-19 cases previously reported for Argentina, but his case was confirmed by tests Saturday. Research is underway to determine who the patient had been in contact with, authorities said.Elsewhere in the region, officials in Peru announced five new cases of COVID-19 infection Saturday, raising the country’s total to six. Paraguay reported its first case, and Chile said it now had seven confirmed cases, up from five.Mexico, Brazil, Ecuador, Peru, Colombia and Costa Rica also have reported confirmed cases of the new coronavirus.According to the latest official data, there are more than 101,000 infected worldwide and more than 3,400 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/argentina-announces-first-coronavirus-death-in-latin-america/story-L4tjuPfuZHSslJ2PT3dLrO.html

08-03-2020||World||Canada declares coronavirus outbreak at long-term care home||Canadian officials have declared an outbreak of the new coronavirus at a long-term care home in North Vancouver after health officials said two elderly residents were diagnosed with the illness.Dr Bonnie Henry, the British Columbia provincial health officer, said on Saturday the two new cases follow an earlier confirmation of COVID-19 in a care worker at the Lynn Valley Care Centre.The care home is now in an outbreak protocol, which restricts visitors and enhances health and safety measures.“We know that the risk to elderly people having this disease is very concerning, particularly older people with underlying chronic illnesses,” Henry said.She said a total of six new cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in British Columbia.“The last two cases really are the most concerning to us,” she told reporters, pausing at length at one point to wipe tears from her eyes.“The message that I think is so important for British Columbians today is that you need to stay home if you’re sick,” Henry said. “We are in an extraordinary situation. We need everybody to be aware, to look after your children.” Henry categorized the two most recent cases as community transmission, distinct from imported cases when a traveler contracts the illness abroad before returning home.At least 57 people in Canada have the virus. British Columbia said Friday that it had activated a pandemics co-ordination plan to respond to the COVID-19 outbreak and was prepared to escalate the response if needed.Canadian health officials are also asking people to avoid cruise ship travel after a cruise ship carrying 237 Canadians reported 21 confirmed cases of the new virus.The Tim Hortons coffee-and-doughnut chain, meanwhile, said it was cancelling its upcoming Roll Up The Rim contest.The company said it is removing all of the contest’s paper cups over health concerns around staff handling items recently gripped and sipped by customers returning them for prizes.

08-03-2020||World||Israeli PM vows to press forth even after election shortfall||A defiant Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Saturday he was “not going anywhere” even after he again fell short of a parliamentary majority with his hard-line allies in his country’s third election in less than a year.Convening what he called an “emergency conference,” Netanyahu accused his opponents of trying to “steal the elections” by aligning with Arab-led parties he said were hostile to the state.The election results looked to extend the country’s year-old political deadlock and weaken the longtime leader as he prepares to go on trial for corruption charges later this month.The embattled Netanyahu had been looking for a decisive victory in Monday’s vote, and initial exit polls had indicated his Likud party and smaller religious and nationalist allies had captured 60 seats, just one short of a majority required to form a new government.Netanyahu triumphantly declared a “huge victory.” But a final count announced by the election commission determined that Netanyahu’s jubilation was premature.Likud emerged as the largest individual party, with 36 seats, ahead of 33 seats for the rival Blue and White Party. But with his smaller allies, Netanyahu’s right-wing bloc captured just 58 seats, well short of the 61-seat majority.While Netanyahu’s opponents control a majority of seats, they are deeply divided, with a hard-line nationalist party and the predominantly Arab Joint List among them. The Joint List captured 15 seats, making it the third-largest party in parliament — its best performance ever.Those divisions could make it difficult for Blue and White’s leader, former military chief Benny Gantz, to establish an alternative coalition. If neither he nor Netanyahu can form a government, the country would head to an unprecedented fourth straight election.But even if he can’t build a government himself this time, Gantz’s party looks to be promoting legislation in the new parliament that would bar anyone indicted of a crime being able to lead a government.The proposal, which would seemingly enjoy a parliamentary majority, has raised the ire of Netanyahu and his allies.“A personal, retroactive law that goes against the most basic principles in democracy,” Netanyahu charged Saturday.“We won’t let it happen. We will exert all our moral power to make sure it doesn’t happen.” The long-serving Israeli leader is scheduled to go on trial March 17 on charges of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes.He is accused of accepting expensive gifts from wealthy friends and offering favors to powerful media moguls in exchange for positive press coverage.Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing and accused the media, police and prosecutors of conspiring to oust him.Netanyahu is desperate to remain in office. Israeli law does not require the prime minister to resign if charged with a crime, and Netanyahu can use the powerful post to rally public support and lash out at what he says is an unfair legal system and hostile media.In comments shortly after Netanyahu’s statements, Gantz refrained from detailing his plans but showed no sign of bending on campaign promises to replace Netanyahu.“I will establish a stable government that would heal Israel from the hate and divisiveness,” he said. “Netanyahu lost. Most of the people decided they don’t want him to continue and that is what they will get.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israeli-pm-vows-to-press-forth-even-after-election-shortfall/story-xJyK6IiC3bcOhfJyGOKDML.html
