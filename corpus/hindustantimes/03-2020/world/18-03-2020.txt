He earlier announced the temporary closure of the border with Canada, by “mutual consent”.The Defense Production Act, which the president said he will sign after a news briefing at the White House, is a Cold War-era law that the administration is expected to use to increase the supplies of ventilators, mask and any other material needed to deal with the outbreak, which has killed at least 110 in the country.Several lawmakers had called for invoking the law in view of the outbreak in recent days. “We need the federal government to aggressively step up its leadership in the battle against COVID-19 by mobilizing the mass production of urgently-needed equipment, preparing for the staging of temporary hospitals and beds, and using every lever of executive power to save lives,” Democratic senator Bob Menendez, had said in a statement on Tuesday.The president announced the closure of border with Canada in a tweet. “We will be, by mutual consent, temporarily closing our Northern Border with Canada to non-essential traffic. Trade will not be affected. Details to follow!” The United States closed the border with Mexico earlier and also banned travel from Europe, China, South Korea and Iran.At the White House briefing, the American president defended once again his continued use of the phrase “Chinese Virus” for coronavirus, which has been criticized as racist and divisive. “It’s not racist at all, not at all,” said the president, adding, “It comes from China, that’s why. I want to be accurate.”Asked if calling it the “Chinese Virus” — or as “Kung-flu”, a reporter asked quoting an unidentified White House official — put Asian Americans at risk, the president said, “not at all”.The president also teased an upcoming announced relating to the Food and Drugs Administration, the US agency that approves new drugs, later Wednesday or Thursday. He did not give details but the Wall Street Journal reported the president was considering issuing an executive order to expand investigational drugs and therapies being tested. Human trials began on a vaccine earlier this week.Asked about the WSJ report, the president said had not seen it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-invokes-war-powers-to-combat-covid-19-us-canada-shut-border/story-Od5JFT5m8UuElGbbo6FKvK.html

India is set to assume the G20 presidency in 2022.“The Saudi G20 Presidency is communicating with G20 countries to convene an extraordinary virtual G20 Leaders’ Summit next week to advance a coordinated response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its human and economic implications,” said a statement issued on Tuesday.“G20 Leaders will put forward a coordinated set of policies to protect people and safeguard the global economy,” it said.The G20 will act along with international organisations to alleviate the impact of the pandemic, and the virtual summit will build on ongoing efforts by G20 finance ministers and central bank governors, senior health, trade, and foreign affairs officials to develop “the precise requirements and actions needed”, the statement said.The planned summit figured in a telephone conversation between Modi and the Crown Prince on Tuesday.The two leaders discussed the global situation related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and Modi emphasised the need for coordinated efforts to address the global challenge that has impacted several hundred thousand people and “threatens to adversely affect the economy in many parts of the world”, said a statement from the external affairs ministry.Modi also mentioned India’s initiative of organising a video conference of leaders of the eight members of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) to forge a joint regional response. During the conference, India said it would set up a $10-million emergency fund.“The two leaders agreed that a similar exercise at the level of G20 leaders, under the aegis of Saudi Arabia as the chair of G20, would be useful at a global scale, both for discussing specific measures to address the challenges posed by the global outbreak of COVID-19 and also to instil confidence in the global populace,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-pandemic-saudi-arabia-calls-for-virtual-summit-of-g20-next-week/story-KXl89uAXbDyMA0Q8ubFsJK.html
18-03-2020||World||Covid-19: India reaches out to citizens, students stranded in UK||The Indian high commission reached out to Indian citizens stranded in the UK after New Delhi’s ban on all travel to the country took effect from 12 noon GMT on Wednesday, as Indian students at various universities faced uncertainty over teaching and stay.The mission, which fielded several queries from Indian citizens and Overseas Citizens of India in recent days, said: “Indian citizens, including students stranded in the UK due to non-availability of flights or closure of hotels who have nowhere to stay may reach us on info.london@mea.gov.in giving their details such as flight bookings, etc”.India on Monday announced a ban until March 31 of travel from UK and the European Union.Indian officials have been in constant touch with the Home Office for assurances on visa-related issues of citizens who are in the UK. The mission said: “UK authorities are working on guidance for Indians in the UK whose visas are due to expire but are currently unable to leave”.On campuses across the UK, thousands of Indian students face uncertainty as universities switch to online teaching and scramble to deal with the implications of the coronavirus challenge, with some managing to leave for India, but others stuck in the UK.The uncertainty has been heightened in universities that asked students to leave campus and go home during Easter vacations.Nicole M Joseph, a student from Bengaluru at the University of Cambridge, said: “I could not go to India. We are not sure what will happen when the next term begins on April 21. I hope they won’t kick us out. My family has been too stressed about me being alone here”.Colleges in Cambridge have come under much criticism for sending allegedly conflicting messages to students; some asked them to leave rooms by Thursday, while others offered accommodation on an exceptional basis if they cannot go to their home countries.Sanjan Das of the Cambridge University India Society said he could not leave after India suspended those holding Overseas Citizen of India status: “We tried to get emergency visa, but was told that was available only for deaths and similar situations. Now no one can go”.Since student visas are linked to attendance at lectures and other academic engagements, the Home Office has relaxed norms, so that those unable to do so are not penalised.The University and College Union (UCU) petitioned the University of Cambridge about growing concern among international students being asked to leave, alleging that its colleges had provoked “wide-scale panic” with their messages.“We are extremely concerned that the invitation to leave the country at such short notice, when most countries are closing their borders, will dramatically affect the most economically and socially vulnerable members of the college community who cannot afford to leave the UK at the last minute, who do not have healthcare coverage in their country of origin, who simply have nowhere else to go, and do not have clear instructions on how leaving will impact their visa status”, UCU said.Universities UK (UUK), the umbrella body representing all UK universities, said Indian and other international students stranded in the UK should be able to continue to stay in university accommodation (‘halls’).A UUK spokesperson said: “A student’s halls are generally their main ‘home’ for much of the year and universities will support those who cannot or do not want to go home. We are seeking specific advice for student accommodation providers from the government on the issue of any student who needs to self-isolate in student accommodation”. “The focus for universities who have students in this situation would be to ensure every possible measure is being taken to support them during self-isolation, to ensure this is effective but also that their needs are met”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-india-reaches-out-to-citizens-students-stranded-in-uk/story-WxlLLUG28hfLWMJLyRdwcI.html

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said closing schools may be necessary soon, a decision likely to worse the virus’ impact.There have been demands that parliament close as the crisis worsens. Speaker Lindsay Hoyle promised to ensure “maximum safety” for politicians and staff: “We are all doing our best to keep Parliament sitting and to follow Public Health England guidance.”The Department of Health said that as of 9 am on Wednesday, 56,221 people were tested, of whom 53,595 were confirmed negative and 2,626 confirmed positive. A break-up showed boroughs in London and nearby areas recording the most cases.The local authorities figuring top of the list of cases include London boroughs of Westminster, Southwark, Kensington and Chelsea, Lambeth, Surrey, and Hammersmith and Fulham. Amid concern over low testing of people suspected to have the virus, health officials said they are working to increase the number of tests that can be conducted by to 25,000 a day, with the increased capacity is expected to be ready within four weeks.Supermarkets in London and elsewhere continued to witness panic-buying, with some limiting the items customers can buy.Sainsbury’s and Asda said they are stopping shoppers buying more than three of any particular food item, while Sainsbury’s is prioritising vulnerable and elderly people for online deliveries. The curbs also apply to cleaning and toiletry products.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-cases-rise-to-2-626-as-london-nearby-areas-top-list/story-sYj5oZ1lg6lJ9E33TQT4IJ.html
18-03-2020||World||“Correct mistakes or else...”: Media war escalates between China and the US||China on Wednesday said it could take more action against US media if Washington did not “correct its mistakes”, a day after announcing the expulsion of American journalists from three newspapers in retaliation of Chinese state media being designated as “foreign missions” in the US.Calling it an “unreasonable oppression” of its journalists in the US, Beijing said the US’s decision was driven by “ideological prejudices”, and it was “compelled” to take counter measures.According to the Foreign Correspondents’ Club of China (FCCC), at least 13 journalists from The New York Times (NYT), The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) and The Washington Post (WP) could be affected by the decision.It could be higher depending on how broadly the group is defined, the FCCC said in a statement.The Chinese foreign ministry said it was within its purview to even not allow the journalists to be expelled to not work from Hong Kong or Macau as the decision was within the purview of “diplomatic affairs”.Foreign ministry spokesperson, Geng Shuang blamed the decision to expel the American journalists on the US government designating several Chinese state media outlets operating in the US as foreign missions.Late on Tuesday, China announced said US journalists working for the NYT, WP, and WSJ, whose credentials were up for renewal in 2020, will have 10 days to turn in their press cards.The decision not only bans them from reporting but also effectively expels them from China as press credentials here are tied to the residence visas for foreign journalists. “We urge the US to take off its ideological prejudice, abandon cold war mentality,” Geng said at the regular press conference on Wednesday.“China is not one to start trouble, but it will not blink if trouble comes. We urge the US side to immediately stop suppressing Chinese media, otherwise the US side will lose even more.”“The US has said that all options are on the table. Today, I can also tell the US that all options are on the table for China,” Geng added.When asked whether the decision not to allow the journalists to work in Hong Kong under the “one country, two systems” agreement, Geng saidGeng said blocking the journalists from working in Hong Kong was within Beijing’s diplomatic purview.Earlier this month, the US announced that five state-controlled Chinese media outlets would be restricted to 100 visas, the de facto expelling of about 60 journalists, the Associated Press said in a reported.It cited increasingly harsh surveillance, harassment and intimidation of American and other foreign journalists working in China.The Chinese outlets employ about 160 Chinese citizens in the U.S. and include the official Xinhua News Agency and China Global Television Network, the overseas arm of state broadcaster CCTV, the AP report said.“There are no winners in the use of journalists as diplomatic pawns by the world’s two preeminent economic powers,” the AP report, quoting the FCCC statement, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/correct-mistakes-or-else-media-war-escalates-between-china-and-the-us/story-mPuORuYVyb4mN8nI51kjOI.html
18-03-2020||World||In UK, even doctors treating patients for coronavirus not being tested||Several Indian and other doctors in the frontline of treating coronavirus patients in the UK have complained that they themselves are not being tested for the virus, prompting growing concern over the ways in which the crisis is being handled by British authorities.“The worst is yet to come. Indian doctors and nursing staff are among those in the frontline of treating coronavirus patients, but we are concerned that they are not being tested”, Ramesh Mehta, president of the British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin, said on Wednesday.“Indian staff is on the frontline, if they and others also go in isolation, it will further worsen the critical staff shortage in National Health Service (NHS). We have written to the Department of Health on this issue. Those who have symptoms should at least be tested,” he added.The Boris Johnson government is bracing for a spike in cases in the next three weeks. Besides advising self-isolation and closure of restaurants, pubs, theatres and public events, it has allocated an additional 330 billion pounds to deal with the situation.Besides concern expressed by many in the Indian community and Indian visitors over the lack of testing for the virus, NHS consultants and others working with less protection have spoken to the British news media, alleging the UK’s guidelines on the issue is “chaotic”.Nishant Joshi, who works in the A&E department of the Luton and Dunstable hospital, told The Guardian: “I’m treating patients who are perhaps presenting for a broken ankle and they suddenly start coughing all over you. You’re breathing in an aerosol spray of droplets and we’re not even wearing a mask – just scrubs and a plastic apron.”“So many of my friends are doctors, nurses and healthcare workers on the frontline…But it’s not going to just be a question of sacrificing ourselves, it’s the risk we pose to everyone we come into contact with which includes some of the most vulnerable people in Britain.”Joshi, whose wife is also a doctor, said “it just makes no sense to any of us”, and recalled World Health Organisation’s advice that testing and contact tracing is vital: “Yet, the (UK) government is not even testing those of us who are being exposed in the course of our work fighting this on the frontline.”Pleading to be tested, Iszy Lord, 25, a doctor working in a hospital in Grimsby, told the BBC: “We’re young and fit whereas our colleagues are much older. We’re just the sort of people who should be working in hospital right now”.“The potential implications for self-isolating people without testing are huge. What’s going to happen if anyone gets anything resembling a cold for the next few months, are we going to have to self-isolate for 14 days each time? It’s alarming”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-in-uk-even-doctors-treating-patients-for-coronavirus-not-being-tested/story-aZEBVp8DejE8Qmf9Gxx0oN.html

Bulgarian citizens were first allowed to cross in carefully controlled convoys, then Romanians had a turn.But by early Wednesday on the Austrian side of the border, trucks were backed up for 28 kilometers (17 miles) and cars for 14 kilometers (nearly 9 miles) as rules allowing only Hungarians or transport trucks through the country’s borders kicked back in.Also read | Coronavirus stays infective in air for hours, on surfaces for daysEuropean Union leaders have been working on how to make sure that food, medical supplies and other essential goods keep flowing but so far borders have been clogged. Looking ahead, they’re also trying to figure out ways to allow seasonal agricultural workers, needed to keep the production of food going, to travel back and forth across essentially closed borders.Nations around the world were facing the same issues, with the U.S. and Canada working on a mutual ban on nonessential travel between the two countries.In Southeast Asia, the causeway between Malaysia and the financial hub of Singapore was eerily quiet after Malaysia shut its borders, while the Philippines backed down on an order giving foreigners 72 hours to leave from a large part of its main island.President Donald Trump’s administration was considering a plan to immediately return to Mexico all people who cross America’s southern border illegally, according to two officials who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because the plan hasn’t been finalized.The coronavirus is now present in every U.S. state after West Virginia reported an infection.

Canadian Jessy Lamontaine and her family were stuck on the island when flights were suspended and they missed the last trip out.“I was in tears this morning,” Lamontaine said. “I couldn’t get any answers from the airline. I had no money and didn’t know whether I was going to keep my job.”Galapagos Gov. Norman Wray said the 2,000 foreigners who remain on the archipelago in the next week may be able to leave on charter or government-approved flights.So far, 81,000 people have recovered from the virus, mostly in China. The virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, for most people, but severe illness is more likely in the elderly and people with existing health problems.In Italy, the hardest hit nation after China, infections jumped to 27,980 on Tuesday. With 2,503 deaths, Italy accounts for a third of the global death toll.Spain, the fourth-most infected country, saw its cases soar by more than 2,000 in one day to 11,178.

18-03-2020||World||Chinese vaccine approved for human testing at coronavirus epicentre Wuhan||CanSino Biologics Inc. said it received Chinese regulatory approval to start human trials of a vaccine against the novel coronavirus, another example of a potential weapon against the illness being fast-tracked for testing as the global death toll escalates and nations impose lockdowns on their citizens.The vaccine, co-developed by the Hong Kong-listed company and China’s Academy of Military Medical Sciences, will undergo clinical trials in Wuhan, CanSino Biologics said in a statement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Wednesday. Wuhan is the epicentre for the pandemic that has spread to all corners of the planet, infecting more than 190,000 people and killing more than 7,800.Progress is occurring at unprecedented speed in developing vaccines as the highly infectious pathogen that causes the respiratory ailment known as Covid-19 looks unlikely to be stamped out through containment measures alone. U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration is pressuring American drugmakers to develop a vaccine: Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Moderna Inc. received regulatory approval to move quickly to human trials last week, skipping the years of animal trials that are the norm in developing vaccines.“You’re planning on administering it to a healthy person who may or may not ever be exposed to the infectious disease agent you’re trying to protect them against,” said Rajeev Venkayya, president of the global vaccine unit at Japan’s Takeda Pharmaceutical Co., said in a separate interview Tuesday. “There’s very little margin for a safety problem.”CanSino’s trial involves injecting the experimental vaccine into 108 healthy adults, aged 18 to 60, in three different doses, according to data from the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry. Tests will start this month and continue through year’s end. The vaccine was tested on animals and proven safe and capable of eliciting immunity against the virus, CanSino said in its statement.As the outbreak spread around the world, more than 100 clinical trials were launched in China to study the effectiveness of everything from anti-flu drugs and antibody-containing plasma from recovered patients, to traditional Chinese herbal medicine. A smaller number of trials have been announced in countries including the U.S., South Korea and Thailand.In normal circumstances, a vaccine could take years to reach human clinical trials as scientists conduct substantial amounts of animal testing first before drug regulators greenlight further trials to determine its safety and efficacy on humans.GlaxoSmithKline Plc said last month it was working with China-based Clover Biopharmaceuticals on an experimental vaccine. Also, the U.S. government’s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority is working with Sanofi and Johnson & Johnson on potential vaccines.Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group Co. also licensed a vaccine that’s now being developed at the pre-clinical stage by Mainz, Germany-based BioNTech SE.Despite the rapid introduction of human trials, the earliest available vaccine is at least six months away, according to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said it would take about a year-and-a-half to complete trials, scale up production and make a vaccine widely available.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-vaccine-approved-for-human-testing-at-coronavirus-epicentre-wuhan/story-6T9BwxvfA1jt3t9M63agvJ.html

WHO says avoid self-medicating with this drug||The World Health Organisation on Tuesday recommended that people suffering from COVID-19-like symptoms should avoid self-medicating with ibuprofen, after French authorities warned anti-inflammatory drugs could worsen the effects of the virus.The warnings over the weekend by French Health Minister Olivier Veran followed a recent study in The Lancet weekly medical journal that hypothesised that an enzyme that is boosted when taking anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen could facilitate and worsen COVID-19 infections.Asked about the study, WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier told reporters in Geneva that the UN health agency’s experts were “looking into this to give further guidance”. Also Watch | Coronavirus | How deadly, how to identify, how to prevent: Dr Trehan answers“In the meantime, we recommend using rather paracetamol, and do not use ibuprofen as a self-medication. That’s important,” he said.Also read: UP doctor who attended to coronavirus patients tests positiveHe stressed though that if ibuprofen had been “prescribed by the healthcare professionals, then, of course, that’s up to them”.His comments came after Veran sent a tweet cautioning that the use of ibuprofen and similar anti-inflammatory drugs could be “an aggravating factor” in COVID-19 infections.“In the case of fever, take paracetamol,” he wrote.He stressed that patients already being treated with anti-inflammatory drugs, should “ask advice from your doctor.” Paracetamol must be taken strictly according to the dose, because too high a dosage can be very dangerous for the liver.Also read: Delhi man flies abroad, test results a day later say coronavirus positiveThe COVID-19 pandemic, which has infected more than 180,000 people worldwide and killed more than 7,000, causes mild symptoms in most people, but can result in pneumonia and in some cases severe illness that can lead to multiple organ failure.Even before the pandemic, French authorities last year sounded the alarm over serious “infectious complications” linked to the use of ibuprofen, which is sold under various brands like Nurofen and Advil, and other anti-inflammatory drugs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-got-coronavirus-symptoms-who-says-avoid-self-medicating-with-ibuprofen/story-ehGk1PkZerrQKkWBgl1LvO.html
18-03-2020||World||Study that led Britain to reverse coronavirus plan projected 5 lakh deaths||Great Britain dramatically changed course on its coronavirus fight plan after an alarming study by researchers at the Imperial College showed that anything other than rapid suppression of the deadly infection could result in hundreds of thousands of deaths.The study, led by Professor Neil Ferguson, an expert on the spread of infectious diseases, was published on March 16. It is entitled the “Impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to reduce COVID19 mortality and healthcare demand.”It detailed three scenarios: One, where the government did nothing, two, where the government focused on mitigation, which is similar to the now-abandoned “herd immunity” plan of the UK, and suppression, which was aggressively undertaken by countries such as China and South Korea.In the first scenario, the study said coronavirus would have caused 510,000 deaths in Britain and 2.2 million in the United States.“Critical care bed capacity would be exceeded as early as the second week in April, with an eventual peak in ICU or critical care bed demand that is over 30 times greater than the maximum supply in both countries,” the study said.In the second scenario, UK would see roughly 250,000 deaths and the US around 1.1-1.2 million deaths.In the third scenario – including school closures, mandatory home quarantines and containment zones – the number of deaths fall to below 20,000 over a two year period.“We therefore conclude that epidemic suppression is the only viable strategy at the current time. The social and economic effects of the measures which are needed to achieve this policy goal will be profound,” the study said.The study said that 9% of people in the most vulnerable age group, 80 and older, could die if infected. The last time the world responded to a global emerging disease epidemic of the scale of the current COVID-19 pandemic with no access to vaccines was the 1918-19 H1N1 influenza pandemic, the study said.After the study was made public, the UK government abandoned its herd immunity plan – under which authorities would isolate cases, but focus on select demographics getting the infection to grow immunity – and focus on aggressive containment, isolation, closures of schools, colleges and public spaces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/study-that-led-britain-to-reverse-coronavirus-plan-projected-5-lakh-deaths/story-kXM90rHcQ5W0i7TL2gVFQL.html
18-03-2020||World||Covid 19: Mild, undocumented coronavirus cases fuelled spread in China, says new study||A new study, which is of particular relevance to India, says mild, undocumented cases of coronavirus fuelled much of the early spread of the disease in China until containment measures like lockdown of cities and home isolation were put in place on January 23.Undocumented cases amounted to more than 86 percent of all cases in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the international study based on a simulated mathematical model said.The findings indicate that a radical increase in the identification and isolation of currently undocumented infections would be needed to fully control the pandemic.The study said that increased testing coupled with travel limits and limits on social contact could reduce the number of undocumented cases significantly.It is clear that strictly maintained social distancing is key to containing the spread of covid-19 as it is almost impossible to detect all the cases – especially many cases are mild and show symptoms not different from the common cold.Until those factors kick in, undocumented cases could be the super-spreaders of the coronavirus or the disease, covid-19.“These undocumented infections often experience mild, limited or no symptoms and hence go unrecognised, and, depending on their contagiousness and numbers, can expose a far greater portion of the population to the virus than would otherwise occur,” said the study conducted by experts from China, the US, UK, and Hong Kong.It was published online earlier this week by the journal, Science and included researchers from Imperial College, London and Tsinghua University in Beijing.The undetected cases were 55 percent as infectious as the detected cases but because of the stealth nature of the infection – and higher numbers – they infected over 80 percent of the cases that were diagnosed, the study found.The researchers tracked reports of infections in China from January 10 to 23, and then again from January 24 to February 8 and added that data to data available about population mobility during the Chinese New Year (CNY) into their computerised mathematical model.“Overall, our findings indicate that a large proportion of covid-19 infections were undocumented prior to the implementation of travel restrictions and other heightened control measures in China on 23 January, and that a large proportion of the total force of infection was mediated through these undocumented infections,” the researchers said.“This high proportion of undocumented infections, many of whom were likely not severely symptomatic, appears to have facilitated the rapid spread of the virus throughout China”.Once the travel restrictions along with other factors like awareness and social distancing kicked in among the people, the percentage of undocumented cases decreased.“The contagiousness of undocumented infections was substantially reduced, possibly reflecting that only very mild, less contagious infections remain undocumented or that individual protective behavior and contact precautions have proven effective”.“Further, general population and government response efforts have increased the use of face masks, restricted travel, delayed school reopening and isolated suspected persons, all of which could additionally slow the spread of SARS-CoV2”.The researchers said it was possible that this particular coronavirus could become endemic to the world.“Our findings underscore the seriousness and pandemic potential of SARS-CoV2. The 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza virus also caused many mild cases, quickly spread globally, and eventually became endemic. Presently, there are four, endemic, coronavirus strains currently circulating in human populations (229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43).”“If the novel coronavirus follows the pattern of 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza, it will also spread globally and become a fifth endemic coronavirus within the human population”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mild-undocumented-coronavirus-cases-fuelled-spread-in-china-says-new-study/story-ElbXHEyx2tEfT2nfAYOi7L.html
18-03-2020||World||Joe Biden sweeps 3 states in Tuesday primaries, gets closer to securing Democratic nomination||Former Vice-President Joe Biden swept all three states that held their nominating contests Tuesday, getting closer to securing the Democratic party nomination to take on President Donald Trump, who clinched his nomination officially, wrapping up the Republican primaries practically unopposed.Senator Bernie Sanders’s path to the nomination is nearly closed now and is expected to come under increasing pressure to end his campaign. Many Democrats declared the race over, and publicly called and signalled for him to give up and not repeat 2016 when he had refused to concede till the end, considerably hurting Hillary Clinton, the nominee.President Trump, meanwhile, easily wrapped up the Republican primaries, winning 1,330 delegates, way more than the 1,276 needed (Democrats have a different count and threshold). He faced no serious challenge. Bill Weld, the former Massachusetts governor, finished a distant second with just one delegate.Biden will now need to unify the Democratic party and win over Sander’s supporters. And he began in real earnest in his victory speech Tuesday, which was sombre given the mood of a nation concerned by the spread of coronavirus that has infected more than 5,600 people and killed ate least 100.“Our campaign has had a very good night,” Biden said, after he was projected to win Florida and Illinois (Arizona was awaited). “And we’ve moved closer to securing the Democratic party’s nomination for president.”But he sought to quickly reach out to Sanders and his supporters. He said he and the Vermont senator “may disagree on tactics, but we have a common vision”. And to Sanders’s supporters, Biden said, “and let me say, especially to the young voters who have been inspired by Senator Sanders: I hear you. I know what is at stake. And I know what we have to do.”Biden won Florida and Illinois with massive leads and was set to win Arizona as well, building on momentum that started in South Carolina, grew on Super Tuesday victories in 10 of 14 states, and continued to roll since picking up five of the six states in the next round, last week. And three out of three on Tuesday, which helped put Biden way beyond Sanders’s reach, according to experts. “No Dem (Democrat) has ever come back from anything like this deficit,” wrote David Axelrod, a key strategist of President Barack Obama’s elections in 2008 and 2012 and now a CNN commentator, wrote on twitter. “The race for the nomination is over. That is the reality.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jpe-biden-sweeps-3-states-in-tuesday-primaries-gets-closer-to-securing-democratic-nomination/story-eoWnVj346d89QtXxbrZyCK.html

Italy has emerged as coronavirus hotspot; in fact, the upward slope of new infections in the country tracks almost exactly the trajectory of cases in Wuhan, China, where the global pandemic began three months ago.BelgiumLike other European countries, Belgium is putting itself under total lockdown. Belgian Prime minister Sophie Wilmes said the residents should stay at home but will still be allowed to run errands, go to work if working remotely is not an option, and to physically exercise outdoors accompanied by one person.New YorkThe administration is considering a total lockdown. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said he was weighing whether to order the city’s 8.5 million residents to “shelter in place” at home, as state and local officials escalated “social distancing” policies by closing schools, restaurants and theaters to curb the spread of the virus.DenmarkTo ban crowding of more than 10 people at a place. More than 1,000 people are infected with coronavirus in Denmark, with four deaths, and the new measures are aimed at curbing the spread of the illness. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said that non-essential businesses such as hairdressers, massage and tattoo parlours, restaurants and bars would also be closed. Supermarkets and pharmacies are excluded from the ban, which is set to remain in place until March 30.United StatesThe Army likely to be deployed to create make-shift hospitals to isolate and treat cases. President Donald Trump said the White House was discussing a “substantial” spending bill with Congress that would include immediate cash payments to Americans.Situation in IndiaThe total number of coronavirus cases rose to 147 on Wednesday - 122 of them are Indians and 25 foreigners. The government successfully traced 5,700 contacts of these 147 positive cases and monitoring them.The Indian government on Tuesday banned passenger flights coming from three more countries: Afghanistan, Philippines and MalaysiaIt has also expanded network of testing labs; and increased testing capacity from 0.3 million to 2.3 million. The government has laid down standard operating procedure for private testing laboratories if they wish to offer testing.About 70,000 people are in home quarantine under community surveillance.Restaurant associations are contemplating total shutdown to avoid risking their employees’ health.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-from-australia-to-us-what-countries-are-doing-the-spread-of-covid-19/story-SoX0o343TICYL20t7R20rO.html
18-03-2020||World||Coronavirus: How to manage stress and anxiety amid Covid-19 outbreak||The coronavirus outbreak is taking a toll on economies and industries across the world. As the virus spreads and infects more people every day, it is likely to feel anxious and overwhelmed. Experts say taking care of mental health and managing stress is equally important during this time. US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has laid down guidelines on managing stress and anxiety in the wake of Covid-19 outbreak. “Fear and anxiety about a disease can be overwhelming and cause strong emotions in adults and children. Coping with stress will make you, the people you care about, and your community stronger,” the CDC website states. Who can respond strongly to the outbreakAccording to the CDC, some people are more likely to feel overwhelmed in such circumstances. Older people, teenagers, people with chronic or terminal illnesses as well as those battling mental illness may respond strongly in such situations and feel more anxious. How can stress manifestStress and anxiety during an infectious disease outbreak can manifest in several ways. People are likely to fear and worry more about their health and the health of their loved ones.“Changes in sleep or eating patterns, difficulty sleeping or concentrating, worsening of chronic health problems and an increased use of alcohol, tobacco, or other drugs,” may also occur due to stress, as reported by the CDC.  What to doIn order to remain anxiety-free and manage stress around the Covid-19 outbreak, the CDC suggests the following:- Take breaks from watching, reading, or listening to news stories, including social media. Hearing about the pandemic repeatedly can be upsetting.- Take care of your body. Take deep breaths, stretch, or meditate. Try to eat healthy, well-balanced meals, exercise regularly, get plenty of sleep, and avoid alcohol and drugs.- Make time to unwind. Try to do some other activities you enjoy.- Connect with others. Talk with people you trust about your concerns and how you are feeling.The CDC also calls for sharing accurate and credible information about Covid-19. It can “help make people feel less stressed”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-how-to-manage-stress-and-anxiety-amid-covid-19-outbreak/story-0aG7YZpNxgvidUlW4QU9qJ.html
18-03-2020||World||UN agency’s ‘kind quick reminder’: Viruses have no nationality||US President Donald Trump on Tuesday sparked a controversy over his “Chinese virus” tweet. Trump later defended his comment and described it as “a very accurate term”.Interestingly, Trump’s “Chinese virus” comment came on the same day when a UN agency posted a “kind reminder” online, urging people to understand that “viruses have no nationality”.In a tweet posted on Tuesday morning, UNESCO said, “Kind quick reminder: viruses have no nationality”.Kind quick reminder: viruses have no nationality.“The fight against #coronavirus needs science, not stigma. It calls for facts, not fear. Together, we will defeat #COVID19,” another tweet by UNESCO read. In his original tweet on Monday, Trump described US airlines and other industries being “particularly affected by the Chinese Virus”.Cuomo wants "all states to be treated the same." But all states aren’t the same. Some are being hit hard by the Chinese Virus, some are being hit practically not at all. New York is a very big "hotspot", West Virginia has, thus far, zero cases. Andrew, keep politics out of it....On Tuesday, he tweeted that some US states were “being hit hard by the Chinese Virus”.During a press conference, Trump defended his remarks and said, “Well, China was putting out information which was false that our military did this to them. That was false. And rather than having an argument, I said I had to call it where it came from. It did come from China. So I think it’s a very accurate term”.While Covid-19 has largely come under control in China, it has killed more than 7,000 people around the world and severely disrupted daily life in Western countries.In India, over 130 people have been infected by coronavirus while three people have been killed. So far, 14 people have recovered from the infection in the country, the Ministry of Health said. Europe has now emerged as the new epicentre of the virus outside China, with countries like Italy and Spain grappling to control the rise in new cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-agency-s-kind-quick-reminder-viruses-have-no-nationality/story-oSJVMhRmBJKqNcs7WNOlgP.html
18-03-2020||World||Amid coronavirus crisis, US looks to send over $1000 directly to citizens via cheques||In order to give relief to the Americans adversely impacted by the economic slump caused by the coronavirus, President Donald Trump has instructed that money be sent to them directly as soon as possible, White House officials said.Neither the White House nor Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said how much money would be sent but Trump told reporters that the amount would be greater than the $1000 being reported in the media.The move comes amid fears of a major hit to the US economy due to the coronavirus crisis. It is assumed that hundreds and thousands of Americans would lose their jobs in the coming months. The entire travel and tourism industry has come to a standstill.Also read: WHO praises India for efforts against novel coronavirusFor instance, casinos in Las Vegas have been closed down, hotel occupancy rates have dropped to single digits, airlines are at a standstill and Disneyland has closed its parks. This in addition to the thousands of restaurants, bars and places of entertainment forced to shut down as a result of public guidelines issued by the White House asking people to stay at home.CEOs of the travel and tourism industry on Tuesday told reporters that a large number of employees have already been furloughed and thousands of Americans might lose their jobs in the coming weeks and months. “My administration is taking decisive action to support American workers and businesses,” Trump said during an interaction with a group of CEOs from the travel and tourism industry.“We are announcing and we will be announcing again later on that we are working with Congress to provide rapid relief for affected workers and industries and this will allow us to emerge as the strongest economy on earth,” he said.Watch |  US President Donald Trump announces first human trial of coronavirus vaccine“We are looking at sending cheques to Americans. Many companies have shut down. Americans need cash now and the President wants to give cash now and I mean now in the next two weeks,” Treasury Secretary Mnuchin told reporters at the White House.He later briefed Senators at the US Capitol on the President’s stimulus package that is estimated to be of $1 trillion.Indian-American Congressman Ro Khanna and his Congressional colleague Tim Ryan commended the administration’s support for cash payments to working Americans, which the two had proposed last week.The current Ryan/Khanna plan, the Emergency Money for the People Act, would provide a monthly cheque of $1,000-$2,000 to every American who earned less than $130,000 last year. The White House has not released details of its direct-cash-to-people plan yet.“Americans need emergency cash, now,” Khanna said.Also read: Act like it’s war-time, says UK PM Boris Johnson on coronavirus“Our economy has to get the stimulus from immediate spending. While we are glad to see that the Trump administration now supports our approach, we can’t wait any longer to see the secretary’s words translate to action,” he added.Under the Ryan/Khanna plan, a vast majority of working-class Americans would qualify for this tax relief. Every American adult making up to $130k would receive at least $1,000 and up to $2,000 per month for 6 months.Congress can then renew this again for another six-month period. This will operate as a temporary, emergency Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), allowing the IRS to access 2019 Tax Return Information in order to ease the cutting and sending of the cheques, Khanna said.Responding to questions, Mnuchin said the administration wanted to make sure that Americans get money in their pockets quickly. “We want to make sure small business owners have access to funds.” Trump said this could be done in four-five different ways, but he wanted it to be done as soon as possible. “There are some very good ways of getting the money out and getting it out quickly. Payroll tax is one way but it does come over a period of months, many months and we want to do something much faster than that. So I think we have ways of getting money out pretty quickly and very accurately,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-coronavirus-crisis-us-looks-to-send-over-1000-directly-to-citizens-via-cheques/story-Ct3O57WWsfjQ8DhGIJBJYN.html
18-03-2020||World||Trump presses for $1 trillion stimulus as coronavirus spreads to all 50 US states, deaths cross 100||The Trump administration pressed on Tuesday for enactment of a $1 trillion stimulus package, possibly with $1,000 direct payments to individual Americans, to blunt the economic pain from a coronavirus outbreak that has killed over 100 people in the country.With cases of the respiratory illness reported in all 50 states and the total number of known U.S. infections surging past 6,400, millions of Americans hunkered down at home instead of commuting to work or going to school.New York City said it might order its 8.5 million residents to “shelter in place” at home, as cities escalated “social distancing” policies by closing schools, restaurants and theaters to curb the spread of the virus.“It’s a very, very difficult decision,” New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said. “We’ve never been here before.” The state’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, told CNN he did not think it would work. About 6.7 million people in the San Francisco Bay area have already been ordered to stay home for all but the most crucial outings until April 7. Eateries were shut down except for carry-out orders and deliveries, and bars were closed, but marijuana dispensaries were allowed to stay open as the drug was deemed an “essential medicine” by health authorities. “It’s like living in a ‘Twilight Zone,’“ said Rowan Oake, 36, during a jog through San Francisco’s Presidio Park. “You can feel the anxiety in the air.” Kentucky and Illinois recorded their first coronavirus deaths, driving the nationwide toll to at least 108.Authorities said 22 people had been infected at a nursing home in suburban Chicago. In Washington state, where 52 people have died, many at a suburban Seattle long-term care facility, Governor Jay Inslee signed legislation approving $200 million for homeless aid and other measures to fight the virus. California’s governor signed off on $1 billion, and Georgia’s governor approved $100 million. In New Jersey, Governor Phil Murphy closed indoor shopping malls while a record number of unemployment applications crashed state computer systems. The nation’s largest indoor shopping center, Minnesota’s Mall of America, said it would close.Kansas shuttered schools through the end of the academic year.Durant tests positiveSheriff’s deputies in Los Angeles County were ordered to write more citations and make fewer arrests, to keep jail crowding to a minimum. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine ordered elective surgeries postponed to preserve hospital space.Less than a week after the NBA suspended its season, star player Kevin Durant tested positive for the virus, the Athletic reported. Vice President Mike Pence said the White House may direct the U.S. military to establish field hospitals in virus hot zones if requested by state governors, or enlist the Army Corps of Engineers to add capacity to existing hospitals.New York, Washington state and California accounted for the bulk of confirmed cases of the highly contagious respiratory illness.Roughly half of all Americans want the U.S. government to act more aggressively to slow transmission of the coronavirus, such as banning large public gatherings and shutting down all overseas flights, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday.President Donald Trump said progress was being made against the fast-spreading pathogen and predicted the U.S. economy would “come roaring back” when it slows.“It’s going to pop,” said Trump, who is seeking re-election on Nov. 3.The Republican president’s tone on the pandemic has changed sharply over the past few days. After initially playing down the threat and focusing on the stock market, his administration has begun pushing for urgent action to stem the disease’s economic and human toll. The White House on Tuesday urged Americans to avoid groups larger than 10. His administration sought more than $1 trillion for a stimulus package, including $50 billion for hard-hit airlines facing bankruptcy.“We’re going big,” Trump said.‘Gag and vote for it’The Trump administration is also considering a plan to send checks to individual Americans of $1,000 to help them weather the crisis, though details of the proposal remained unclear.High earners might not qualify for payments, which could be sent within the next two weeks, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said.Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said his chamber would this week pass a multibillion-dollar emergency spending bill cleared by the House of Representatives on Saturday, despite concerns from some Republicans. He said he told them to “gag and vote for it anyway.”Mnuchin warned Republican senators privately that U.S. unemployment could hit 20% if Congress failed to act. McConnell said the Senate would not leave town until it passes a follow-up package.The House bill would provide free coronavirus testing, establish paid sick leave for most workers and expand unemployment compensation. U.S. stocks jumped on Tuesday, a day after their steepest declines since the 1987 crash, as the Federal Reserve took further steps to boost liquidity. The benchmark S&P 500 closed up 6%. Mnuchin said the government may shorten trading hours if necessary.Travel restrictionsTrump said travel restrictions within the United States remained on the table.“You can do a national lockdown. Hopefully, we’re not going to need that,” Trump said. “It’s a very big step.”He asked Americans to avoid traveling and urged them to “buy less” when they go to stores after nationwide reports of anxious shoppers emptying grocery store shelves.“We’re asking our older generation to stay in their homes. ... We’re asking the younger generation to stop going out,” said Trump coronavirus adviser Dr. Deborah Birx.It was St. Patrick’s Day but the mood was sober after parades and parties celebrating the Irish heritage of many Americans were canceled around the country and bars were shuttered. Florida’s governor said bars and nightclubs in his state would close for 30 days.Primary election voters in Florida, Illinois and Arizona were met by gloved poll workers and hand sanitizer as they cast ballots on Tuesday in the state-by-state process of selecting a Democratic challenger to Trump in the November election.Ohio officials postponed that state’s primary due to coronavirus fears hours before voting was to begin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-presses-for-1-trillion-stimulus-as-coronavirus-spreads-to-all-50-us-states-deaths-cross-100/story-oROYm2bV7FVY4YeNi8KJoK.html

That was false. And rather than having an argument, I said I had to call it where it came from. It did come from China,” the President told reporters at a White House news conference.“So I think it’s a very accurate term. I didn’t appreciate the fact that China was saying that our military gave it to them. Our military did not give it to anybody,” Trump said. An hour later, he started his meeting with CEOs of the hotel and tourism industry by using the term “China Virus”. Trump refuted the notion that his using of the phrase created a stigma against the Chinese. “I don’t think so. I think saying that our military did to them creates a stigma,” he asserted.Also read: Govt scales up kits, labs for coronavirus, but not testsDuring the news conference, Trump said he took the right decision by imposing a travel ban on China.Also Watch | US President Donald Trump announces first human trial of coronavirus vaccineHe replied in the negative when asked about disruption in the supply chain given that many precursors for pharmaceuticals come from China.“No, I don’t see that at all and I think China has every incentive to make sure that things work well.

We have a good relationship with China. We have a signed agreement. They’re going to be buying and they have been buying a lot of product,” he said.Right now, he said, China has been sending the US everything it needs. “But we are looking at some alternatives,” he added.The US and China have sparred over the origin of the virus for days, with a Chinese official promoting conspiracy theories claiming it was brought to China by the US army and Beijing accusing American officials of stigmatizing an entire nation.Also read: Novel coronavirus can survive on surfaces or in air for several hours, says studyIn his original tweet on Monday, Trump described US airlines and other industries being “particularly affected by the Chinese Virus”.On Tuesday, he tweeted that some US states were “being hit hard by the Chinese Virus”.Trump’s allies had previously referred to the pandemic as the “Chinese coronavirus”, but Beijing said it was “strongly indignant” over the phrase, which it called “a kind of stigmatization”.The US should “immediately stop its unjustified accusations against China,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters in Beijing.A commentary by the official Xinhua news agency said using “racist and xenophobic names to cast blame for the outbreak on other countries can only reveal politicians’ irresponsibility and incompetence which will intensify virus fears.” The war of words reignited diplomatic tensions between the two countries, which have tussled over trade and other disputes since Trump took office.Trump’s comments were also criticized inside the US, with warnings it could incite a backlash against the Asian-American community.Also read: At 5 Delhi quarantine facilities, passports taken, complaints over hygiene“Our Asian-American communities -- people YOU serve -- are already suffering. They don’t need you fuelling more bigotry,” tweeted New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, whose state is one of the hardest-hit by the virus in the country.The World Health Organization said more cases and deaths had been reported in the rest of the world than in China.The new coronavirus was first detected late last year, with China’s own health officials initially saying its source was a live animal market in the central city of Wuhan, whose government had initially tried to cover up the outbreak.But China has sought to distance itself from the virus, saying the origin is still unknown, while seeking global goodwill by offering aid to countries facing serious outbreaks.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in a phone call he initiated with top Chinese official Yang Jiechi, voiced anger that Beijing has used official channels “to shift blame for COVID-19 to the US”, the State Department said.Pompeo “stressed that this is not the time to spread disinformation and outlandish rumours, but rather a time for all nations to come together to fight this common threat”, the department added.The State Department on Friday summoned Chinese ambassador Cui Tiankai to denounce Beijing’s promotion of a conspiracy theory that had gained wide attention on social media.Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian suggested on Twitter last week that “patient zero” in the global pandemic may have come from the US.“It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation,” tweeted Zhao, who is known for his provocative statements on social media.Pompeo himself has sought to link China to the global pandemic, repeatedly referring to the “Wuhan virus” despite advice from health professionals that such geographic labels can be stigmatizing.Yang issued a “stern warning to the US that any scheme to smear China will be doomed to fail”, Xinhua said in its summary of the call with Pompeo.The key Chinese foreign policy leader “noted that some US politicians have frequently slandered China and its anti-epidemic efforts and stigmatized the country, which has enraged the Chinese people”, Xinhua said.Yang called on the US side to “correct its wrongful behaviour”.Trump is under fire over his handling of the pandemic, and his backers have sought to cast the coronavirus as a disease brought by foreigners.While COVID-19 has largely come under control in China, it has killed more than 7,000 people around the world and severely disrupted daily life in Western countries.

18-03-2020||World||22 lakh coronavirus deaths in US, 5 lakh in UK, predicts British study||A piece of research that helped convince the British government to impose more stringent measures to contain COVID-19 painted a worst case picture of hundreds of thousands of deaths and a health service overwhelmed with severely sick patients.In a sharp toughening of Britain’s approach to the outbreak on Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson closed down social life in the world’s fifth largest economy and advised those over 70 with underlying health problems to isolate.The projection study, by a team led by Neil Ferguson, a professor of mathematical biology at Imperial College London, used new data gathered from Italy, where the infectious disease epidemic has surged in recent weeks.  Also Watch | Idris Elba tests positive for coronavirus, says time for ‘social distancing’Comparing the potential impact of the COVID-19 disease epidemic with the devastating flu outbreak of 1918, Ferguson’s team said that with no mitigating measures at all, the outbreak could have caused more than half a million deaths in Britain and 2.2 million in the United States. Even with the government’s previous plan to control the outbreak - which involved home isolation of suspect cases but did not include restrictions on wider society - could have resulted in 250,000 people dying “and health systems...being overwhelmed many times over,” the study said.With the measures outlined - including extreme social distancing and advice to avoid clubs, pubs and theatres - the epidemic’s curve and peak could be flattened, the scientists said. “This is going to place huge pressure on us as a society, and economically,” said Azra Ghani, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Imperial who co-led the work with Ferguson.This study helped change the British government’s position, according to those involved with the decision. The government said it had accelerated its plans “the advice of the experts” and that the new measures had always been “part of the government’s action plan”.“We continue to follow the science and act on the advice of the experts, which is that we are bringing in these more substantial measures slightly faster than we originally planned,” the source said.Tim Colbourn, an expert in global health epidemiology at University College London said the projections in the study signalled “tough times ahead”.“The results are sobering,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-study-prompted-britain-to-take-coronavirus-more-seriously/story-G4ec1LATHSGdRMyFZXgObI.html
18-03-2020||World||President Trump clinches Republican Party nomination with Tuesday primary wins||President Donald Trump has clinched the Republican Party nomination, surpassing the necessary delegate threshold.Trump, who had only token opposition, now has more than the 1,276 delegates needed after winning Tuesday’s Florida and Illinois primaries, according to The Associated Press’ delegate count.That makes Trump the undisputed Republican nominee as Democrats continue to wage a contested primary contest between former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.This is the earliest the delegate calendar permits a Republican to clinch the nomination.“It shows the enthusiasm behind President Trump, it shows how unified Republicans are behind President Trump and how intense their support for him is,” said Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh, who noted Trump has set record vote tallies, even in largely uncontested contests.“Republicans and President Trump’s supporters have been just itching to get involved in the process that will end with his reelection in November,” Murtaugh said.Trump had 1,141 delegates going into Tuesday’s Florida and Illinois primaries (Arizona was not holding a Republican primary) and he needed 135 more to win. The wins in Florida and Illinois were big because their primaries awarded all delegates to the winner.Regardless of the order of the race calls, Trump’s campaign intended to credit Florida for putting him over the top as it tries to highlight a state that was crucial to Trump’s 2016 victory and will likely be required for him to win again in 2020.The president had accumulated all but one of the available delegates this primary season, with former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld winning a single delegate in the Iowa caucuses.That lone Weld delegate can now vote for Trump if he is the only candidate nominated, according to GOP rules.Trump’s re-nomination came much faster than in 2016, when he passed the magic number in late May in North Dakota. Trump marked the occasion with a news conference in Bismarck, during which he shook hands with the two delegates who had carried him over the threshold.Besides the lack of big-name opponents, Trump was bolstered by rules changes in the Republican nominating process that the White House had aggressively pushed, including canceled primaries and caucuses long before the coronavirus pandemic, higher thresholds to get delegates and more winner-take-all contests.“The rules were tweaked in a big number of states to make it much harder for the also-rans for the nomination to compete in any meaningful way,” said delegate expert and political scientist Josh Putnam of Frontloading HQ.But it also “speaks to something we kind of knew going into this,” Putnam said. “The party, at least the folks opting to turn out to vote, were unifying behind their president.”Trump is deeply popular within the Republican Party despite his overall low job approval numbers, and his campaign has been in general election mode since Trump filed for reelection back in January 2017.The results come as Biden and Sanders continue their fight for the Democratic nomination, despite Biden’s commanding lead.While securing the nomination before his eventual Democratic rival “in regular times would be a decent advantage” for Trump, the novel coronavirus pandemic that has upended American life could change that, Putnam said.Trump can no longer hold the signature mass rallies that have fueled his campaign and the economy is now in free fall. But Murtaugh argued his team is better equipped than Democrats’ for a virtual campaign thanks to a data advantage fueled, in part, but years worth of rallies that serve as voter information collection powerhouses.“The amount of work that we can do digitally and virtually can’t be matched by the other side,” Murtaugh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/president-trump-clinches-republican-party-nomination-with-tuesday-primary-wins/story-MFVnazUqfIx3Ihwp5sJ2CM.html
18-03-2020||World||European Union shuts its borders for 30 days in desperate effort to stop coronavirus||European Union leaders agreed to restrict most travel into the continent in an unprecedented move aimed at slowing down the spread of a deadly coronavirus and mitigating its effects on the bloc.The restrictions will apply to all non-EU citizens and last for an initial 30 days, German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters after a video conference with her fellow leaders. Merkel said that the group expressed a “great readiness” to do whatever is necessary to contain the outbreak and was braced for a “very serious” economic impact.Banning all travel to foreign nationals adds to a series of restrictive measures that would have been unthinkable in western democracies only a few weeks ago. Several EU member states have imposed curfews and lockdowns, shutting shops, bars, schools, and restaurants in a last-ditch effort to stop the disease from overwhelming the continent’s healthcare systems.For the U.K., which has left the EU, the question becomes how this will affect its travelers. From the EU perspective, the ban does not extend to them but in practice, everyone is being told to stay put given that the U.K. has advised its citizens to avoid non-essential travel anywhere in the world. With flights canceled, crossings between the U.K. and the continent has become impossible.While the moves are deemed essential by many epidemiologists, they are bound to deal a severe blow to the European and global economies. EU governments officially acknowledge the bloc is heading to a recession this year -- the first since the sovereign debt crisis.The sealing of Europe’s external border is aimed at lifting an ever-growing number of internal border closings, which have disrupted free movement within the bloc -- one of the key pillars of European integration. It’s unclear, however, whether the internal border checks will be phased out following the latest decision, given the fear of many governments about virus transmissions from visitors, European or otherwise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/european-union-shuts-its-borders-for-30-days-in-desperate-effort-to-stop-coronavirus/story-ml0FgeGHiCJ9TQxtqe4V3K.html
18-03-2020||World||Novel coronavirus can survive on surfaces or in air for several hours: Study||The novel coronavirus can survive on surfaces or in the air for several hours, according to a US-government funded study published Tuesday.Scientists found that the virus that causes the COVID-19 disease had similar levels of viability outside the body to its predecessor that caused SARS.This means that factors like greater transmission between people with no symptoms might be why the current pandemic is far greater than the SARS outbreak of 2002-2003. Also Watch | Coronavirus | India cases rise, minister quarantined, vaccine tests: Top 10 updatesThe new paper was published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) and carried out by scientists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), University of California, Los Angeles and Princeton.The new coronavirus was detectable for up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel, and for up to 24 hours on cardboard.The team used a nebulizer to simulate a person coughing or sneezing, and found that the virus was detectable for three hours in the air.The study was first posted on a medical pre-print website last week before it was peer-reviewed, and attracted much attention, including some criticism from scientists who said that it may have overstated the airborne threat.The virus is predominantly transmitted by respiratory droplets and in this form it is viable for only a few seconds after a person coughs or sneezes.Critics questioned whether a nebulizer accurately mimicked a human cough or sneeze.The team behind the NEJM study performed similar tests on the SARS virus, finding the two viruses behave similarly.But their similar viability fails to explain why the novel coronavirus pandemic has infected close to 200,000 people and caused almost 8,000 deaths, while the SARS epidemic infected about 8,000 and killed nearly 800.“This indicates that differences in the epidemiologic characteristics of these viruses probably arise from other factors, including high viral loads in the upper respiratory tract and the potential for persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 to shed and transmit the virus while asymptomatic,” wrote the researchers.SARS-CoV-2 is the technical name for the new coronavirus.The findings affirm guidance from public health professionals regarding social distancing, avoiding touching the face, covering your cough or sneeze, and frequently disinfecting objects using cleaning sprays or wipes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-coronavirus-can-survive-on-surfaces-or-in-air-for-several-hours-study/story-ohkvk5DRveaUFAeh9ppBzJ.html
18-03-2020||World||US puts Islamic State chief on blacklist of terrorists||The United States has placed the new leader of the Islamic State group on its blacklist of terrorists, naming him as Amir Mohammed Abdul Rahman al-Mawli.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday said that al-Mawli was named leader of the ultra-violent group after an October raid by US commandos killed its chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.The organization had earlier named Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Quraishi as its new head, but US officials acknowledged they knew little about him -- and later came to believe that the Islamic State group was using his nom de guerre.Al-Mawli “was previously active in al-Qaeda in Iraq and is known for torturing innocent Yazidi religious minorities,” Pompeo said.“We’ve destroyed the caliphate and we remain committed to ISIS’s enduring defeat no matter who they designate as their leader,” he said.A US-led coalition, spearheaded on the ground by Syrian Kurdish fighters, crushed the Islamic State’s so-called caliphate that once stretched for vast stretches of Iraq and Syria -- but the group has inspired attacks much farther afield.Al-Mawli was named a specially designated global terrorist, putting him on a list created after the September 11, 2001 attacks that makes any support to him a crime in the United States.The State Department has already issued a USD5 million bounty for information leading to al-Mawli’s capture.A scholar in Islamic sharia law, al-Mawli rose through the ranks by issuing edicts to justify the persecution of the Yazidi, a campaign that the United Nations has described as genocide.The jihadists killed thousands of Yazidis, who practice an ancient religion, and abducted and enslaved thousands more women and girls as they rampaged across the Middle East.The Guardian, in a January article that cited intelligence sources, said that al-Mawli was raised in an Iraqi Turkmen family -- making him one of the few non-Arabs to rise through the ranks of the extremist group.The newspaper said that intelligence officials were unsure of his whereabouts but believe he likely followed Baghdadi to Idlib, the last Syrian outpost out of the control of President Bashar al-Assad’s forces.The Counter Extremist Project, which tracks militants, said that al-Mawli served in the Iraqi military under Saddam Hussein before joining Al-Qaeda in Iraq, becoming a jurist for the Sunni Arab militants.It said that US forces captured al-Mawli and jailed him in southern Iraq where he formed his bond with Baghdadi, who was also jailed as part of Al-Qaeda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-puts-is-chief-on-blacklist-of-terrorists/story-WTBSSs5UuwHqWDX9kqWFzK.html
18-03-2020||World||Act like it’s war-time, says UK PM Boris Johnson on coronavirus||Scaling up efforts to deal with the coronavirus crisis, Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday said “we must act like a war-time government”, while his chief scientific advisor Patrick Vallance told MPs that less than 20,000 deaths in the UK would, while “horrible”, be a “good outcome”.Vallance said it was “reasonable” to assume there were as many as 55,000 cases already in the country, which is nearing an Italy-like peak in the next three to four weeks. As chancellor Rishi Sunak unveiled a 330 billion pounds package to deal with the economic impact, Johnson said: “I stress although the measures are extreme we may well have to go further and faster. And we must act like any war-time government and do anything it takes to support our economy.”“Yes, this enemy can be deadly. But it is also beatable. But we know how to beat it”, he added. Both Johnson and Sunak said the government would do “whatever it takes” to overcome the crisis in the coming months.So far, the UK’s official figure is 1,950 people who tested positive and 56 dead. The measures such as social isolation and closure of public places described as ‘draconian’ by Johnson on Monday would need to be in place at least for “months”, Vallance said. Simon Stevens, chief executive of the National Health Service also told MPs of plans to postpone routine surgery, to prepare for “the likely influx of more coronavirus patients”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/act-like-it-s-war-time-says-uk-pm-boris-johnson-on-coronavirus/story-06d2sWSFDG8afy5B1YfClN.html
18-03-2020||World||China to expel more American journalists from leading US dailies||China on Tuesday said it will revoke the press credentials of American journalists working for the New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post before the end of the month, weeks after President Donald Trump put a limit on the number of Chinese citizens working in the US for five state-controlled Chinese media outlets.The late night announcement from the Chinese foreign ministry – and the latest round of escalation of US-China media war - added that these three US outlets as well as Time magazine and the Voice of America furnish detailed information about their operations in China including details of their staff members.The retaliation comes after Beijing expelled three journalists from the WSJ in February for an opinion piece on the coronavirus epidemic they did not write.“In response to the US slashing the staff size of Chinese media outlets in the US, which is expulsion in all but name, China demands that journalists of US citizenship working with the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post whose press credentials are due to expire before the end of 2020 notify the Department of Information of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs within four calendar days starting from today and hand back their press cards within ten calendar days,” the announcement said.They will not be allowed to continue working as journalists in the People’s Republic of China, including its Hong Kong and Macao Special Administrative Regions, it added.Also in response to the US designation of five Chinese media agencies as “foreign missions”, China demands, “…in the spirit of reciprocity, that the China-based branches of Voice of America, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post and Time declare in written form information about their staff, finance, operation and real estate in China”. The statement added: “…in response to the discriminatory restrictions the US has imposed on Chinese journalists with regard to visa, administrative review and reporting, China will take reciprocal measures against American journalists.”US secretary of state Mike Pompeo on Tuesday urged Beijing to reconsider its effective expulsions of US journalists, saying that China benefits from free media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-expel-more-american-journalists-from-leading-us-dailies/story-GFcXR0UDH8LVOejLfovQFP.html
18-03-2020||World||Rush for air tickets in UK to beat India travel ban from Wednesday||Economy tickets on most flights out of the UK direct to destinations in India were sold out following a rush to beat the ban imposed by New Delhi on travellers from the UK taking effect from 12 noon GMT (5.30 pm India time) on Wednesday.No economy tickets were available on airlines’ online sites to Delhi or Mumbai, while major travel agencies dealing mainly with tickets to India stopped taking calls. The Boris Johnson government also highlighted the ban and advised Britons against all but essential travel to the country.Only some premium or upper class tickets were available, costing thousands of pounds. The ban announced in New Delhi on Monday affects all travellers, including British citizens, Overseas Citizens of India and Indian citizens travelling to India from airports in the UK.Revising its travel advisory for India, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) said: “The Government of India has announced that passengers from the UK (and the EU and Turkey) will be prohibited from entering India”.“Airlines will not permit passengers from those countries to board planes from 1200 GMT on 18 March 2020. The restrictions are due to be in place till at least 31 March 2020. This does not affect British Nationals already in India who should follow the advice of local authorities”, it added.UK inward and outward travel has already fallen by a significant amount since the outbreak of coronavirus. Ryanair, Virgin and EasyJet have cut flights by 80% this month and IAG has decreased capacity by 75%.Foreign secretary Dominic Raab said in the House of Commons: “UK travellers abroad now face widespread international border restrictions and lock downs in various countries. The speed and range of those measures across other countries is unprecedented”.“So I have taken the decision to advise British nationals against all non-essential international travel.”The official advisory, which is central to business and insurance arrangements, noted the steps taken by India to deal with the coronavirus challenge.It said: “There is an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) in China, but cases have been confirmed in other countries, including in India. India has announced additional measures to limit the spread of coronavirus”.“You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities, which can vary state by state from outright bans to quarantines to restrictions on large gatherings”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-uk-notes-india-ban-advises-against-travel/story-ibZMzORvfEphrGHHgsdHsK.html
