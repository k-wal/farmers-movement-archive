Adding to the urgency of the crisis facing many American businesses large and small and individuals and families, US Senate failed to agree on a massive $1.8 trillion federal relief and stimulus package Sunday. Negotiations continue however as both sides are keen to find common ground.At least 414 people have died of the coronavirus so far and more than 34,000 people have tested positive including Rand Paul, a Republican senator and a close ally of President Trump, who is now the third American lawmaker infected. Four of his colleagues self-quarantined shortly after.Calling Paul a “great friend”, President Trump said at the daily White House briefing the virus is “getting quite close to home, and it’s a terrible thing that’s going on”.The New York City region, which had been the president’s home for many decades until recently and continues to host the headquarters of his business operations, now accounts for roughly 5% of the cases around 340,000 cases worldwide, with more than half the 20,000 cases reported in New York state. The increase in numbers is reflection of the increase in the number of tests being conducted, state officials have said and not necessarily of the spread of the virus.“I need every New Yorker to understand how serious the situation is right now,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said Sunday evening, “We have to change the way we live if we’re going to bend the curve of this epidemic. Do your part: stay home. That is the single most important thing someone can do right now.” He said there have been 9,654 positive cases of COVID-19 and 63 fatalities so far (99, according to some reports Monday morning) in New York City.The mayor has been calling his city the “epicenter” of the global outbreak, in effort to highlight the gravity of the situation. It is “ now clearly the epicenter of this American crisis – literally, one-third of all the cases in this nation right here in my city, sad to say, and two-thirds of the cases in New York State, and climbing,” he said on CNN Sunday.New York has turned into a virtual ghost town compared to the bustling city most residents and visitors have known it for long. All non-essential workers are staying home on orders of the local authorities, shutting down nearly every part and aspect of the city, stores, restaurants bars.Ravi Batra, a leading Indian American lawyer, is among the city’s growing number of people to have tested positive, along with two members of his family. Since Friday, he has been on anti-malarial drug treatment, which is scheduled to be rolled out on an expanded trial basis in New York Tuesday, in a move strongly backed by the president.“My fevers (come and go) with a rollercoaster vengeance, going from low to 104.3,” he wrote in a text message, adding, “I expect my fever fight to continue till COVID-19 (illness caused by the coronavirus) is beaten.”Millions of Americans — nearly one in five — are staying home as an increasing number of states are issued “stay-at-home” orders or version of restricting outdoor activities to prevent the spread of the virus. States of Ohio, Delaware, and Louisiana and Philadelphia city in Pennsylvania states went under state-at-home restrictions on Sunday, joining New York, California, Washington and Illinois. Several cities have resorted to nighttime curfews, such as Hoboken in New Jersey, just across a river from New York City.The Trump administration has declared New York and Washington state as disaster-hit areas for the purposes of speedy deployment of federal assistance and the same as being processed for California as well, the president said Sunday evening.He added that large volumes of supplies such as surgical masks, respirators, gowns and overalls have been send to New York and Washington already, and large medical stations with thousands of beds are being despatched to those states as well, also to California. Two US navy hospital ships are also on their way.“We’re at war,” Trump said. “In a true sense, we’re at war. And we’re fighting an invisible enemy.” The president then went on to detail his administration’s response in a continued bid to address earlier criticism for being inadequate and sluggish, stemming largely from his own reluctance, reportedly, to acknowledge the gravity of the crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-city-region-is-the-new-epicenter-with-more-than-5-of-worldwide-cases/story-Y9Dr0Tj6ZS9ACUtWBhHhLN.html

She received the precautionary vaccination against pneumococcal infection on Friday.The 65-year-old, who has led Germany since 2005, was informed about the doctor’s test shortly after holding a news conference announcing new measures to curb the spread of the virus.On Monday, she led a Cabinet meeting by phone from home.For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever or coughing. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-chancellor-angela-merkel-negative-in-1st-coronavirus-test/story-EPbsu13fRnUCJdxu6oQqIJ.html
23-03-2020||World||China says it is ready to help India in Covid-19 fight, shares info over video link||China on Monday reiterated its offer to help and assist India in its fight against the Covid-19 outbreak, which threatens to spread in the south Asian country as New Delhi takes gradual steps to impose a countrywide lockdown.The foreign ministry’s offer of help comes soon after India took part in a Beijing-led video conference over the weekend where Chinese experts shared their epidemic prevention experience with officials from South Asian countries.More than 2000 officials from health departments, diplomatic services, defence ministries and customs from India, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Nepal, Pakistan, Maldives and Bangladesh participated in it.“The WHO (World Health Organisation) delegates in the relevant countries also participated in the video conference. The conference was a platform to share China’s experience in epidemic prevention, diagnosis, and control, treatment, supply guarantee and answered around 80 questions,” foreign ministry spokesperson, Geng Shuang said at the regular ministry briefing on Monday.“The conference lasted for 4 hours, and around 2000 representatives participated in it. The participants thought it was timely and necessary to learn from China’s experience. China will continue to uphold the vision of a community with a shared future for mankind and engage in more cooperation with the international community,” Geng added.On assisting India, Geng said both countries were exchanging information on the outbreak.“We have a mechanism of exchange and China has been notifying the information to India in a timely manner. We have also been providing assistance and convenience to the Indians in China. We have been protecting their health and safety,” Geng said.“As the pandemic spreads we have noted the situation in India. China and India are the only two countries with that large a population. The virus is a challenge to all and we would like to share our experience and provide necessary assistance to the Indian side. India was also a part of the video conference that was conducted last week,” the spokesperson said.Geng added that after the outbreak, China and India have been in communication and “there is cooperation between the two”.“Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi sent a letter (to President Xi Jinping), and the Indian foreign minister also spoke with the Chinese side over phone. We have received assistance from the Indian side and we applaud that,” he said.The Indian government had sent 15 tons of medical supplies to China on an Indian Air Force flight that also took back about a 100 Indians from Wuhan and Hubei on its way back in the last week of February.The Indian medical assistance to China comprised “…masks, gloves and other emergency medical equipment”.“This assistance has been provided in the wake of the Coronavirus outbreak in China and the request by China to provide supplies such as masks and medical equipment,” an Indian government statement had then said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-says-it-is-ready-to-help-india-in-covid-19-fight-shares-info-over-video-link/story-6z8QJMznkJUSU55gy1jX4O.html
23-03-2020||World||Hong Kong bars non-residents, limits alcohol over coronavirus scares||Hong Kong will ban all non-residents from entering the financial hub from midnight on Tuesday evening in a bid to halt the coronavirus, its leader said Monday, as she also ordered restaurants and bars to stop serving alcohol.Despite its proximity to the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong has managed to stave off a runaway outbreak of the deadly virus partly thanks to the public overwhelmingly embracing face masks, hand hygiene and social distancing.Yet in the last two weeks, the number of cases has more than doubled to 356 infections after locals and foreign residents flooded back once the pandemic spread to Europe and North America.On Monday chief executive Carrie Lam announced a raft of measures designed to stymie the rising number of infections.“From midnight of March 25, all non-Hong Kong residents flying in from overseas will not be allowed into the city,” she said, adding the order would be in place for at least two weeks.The city’s airport -- the eighth busiest in the world -- would also bar all transit passengers, Lam added.Non-residents will still be allowed to enter Hong Kong from the Chinese mainland, Macau and Taiwan but not if they have been to any other foreign country in the last 14 days.Some 8,600 restaurants and bars with a licence will also be banned from selling alcohol but will, for now, be allowed to remain open.Lam did not specify when the booze ban would be brought in, but said emergency legislation was being drafted.She said there was concern that Hong Kongers were losing their inhibitions when they go out drinking.“Sometimes when people drink more, there may be some intimate acts,” she told reporters.Supermarkets and alcohol retailers are not covered by ban on sales.‘One night stands’ Health officials had become increasingly alarmed about people gathering in large numbers in the city’s entertainment districts in recent weeks.Last week, a slew of infections was found among patients who had all been out in Lan Kwai Fong, the city’s most famous nightclub street.Hong Kong’s tabloids ran lurid pieces saying one of the infected patients who went to bars in Lan Kwai Fong, a local, may have had one night stands.The vast majority of the recent spike in infections have been from Hong Kong nationals returning to the city.But there has also been some anger directed at the drinking habits of some western white-collar workers as many of the city’s inhabitants isolate themselves.Last week the Apple Daily newspaper carried a front-page photograph of a big group of foreigners drinking in the open while sitting shoulder-to-shoulder, causing outrage on social media.Restaurant groups had urged the government to allow them to remain open.The partial booze ban appears to be a compromise -- a way to reduce the number of people socialising without ordering a complete shutdown of the already struggling food and drink industry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-bars-non-residents-limits-alcohol-over-coronavirus-scares/story-IKm7ueytYHcE0MoEICbp8I.html
23-03-2020||World||China easing Wuhan lockdown, fight continues against imported Covid-19 cases||China continued the gradual easing of the lockdown mode in the coronavirus-hit Hubei province and its capital Wuhan city as the country recorded zero new cases of domestic Covid-19 infections on Sunday.China reported 39 new overseas cases of the infection with Beijing and Shanghai reporting 10 new cases each.It was a drop from Saturday’s 46 overseas cases.No new confirmed case of Covid-19 was reported Sunday in Wuhan, marking the fifth day in a row of zero report as the former hardest-hit city recovers from the epidemic, local media reported.The rest of the province outside Wuhan had not seen new indigenous Covid-19 cases for 17 consecutive days.More on Covid-19:• Your guide to staying safe• Editorial: Time to prepare for Stage 3• How difficult it is to maintain 1-metre distance• How coronavirus is different from seasonal flu and common coldAll nine deaths reported in the mainland on Sunday, however, were in Wuhan, national health commission (NHC) reported on Monday.“The overall confirmed cases on the mainland had reached 81,093 by the end of Sunday, including 5,120 patients who were still being treated, 72,703 patients who had been discharged after recovery, and 3,270 people who died of the disease,” the official news agency, Xinhua reported.Health officials said that most regions in China are now at low-risk of the novel Covid-19 outbreak.Meanwhile, residents living in and outside Wuhan will be allowed to travel into the city to resume work if they have a green health code issued by the government and normal body temperature, state media reported quoting a new notice from the local epidemic prevention and control command centre.From this week, non-local people stranded in Wuhan can also apply to leave the city after taking getting health check-up and receiving a health certificate from the government.Wuhan, a city of around 11 million people, was locked down on January 23 in an attempt by the government to contain the spread of the outbreak.The lockdown was then gradually extended to the entire province with several cities also locked down and intra-provincial transportation completely shut down.China is scrambling to contain the overseas cases of Covid-19, which until Sunday midnight was more than 350.Of the 39 newly imported cases, 10 were reported in Beijing, 10 in Shanghai, six in Fujian, six in Guangdong, two in Shandong and Gansu respectively, and one in Zhejiang, Henan and Chongqing respectively, according to the NHC.Starting Monday, all international flights into Beijing will first land at another airport, where passengers will undergo virus screening, government agencies said on Sunday, in an expansion of existing measures.“All international flights must first divert to one of the 12 designated entry points in other cities before they are allowed to enter Beijing. Airports including Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, Shanghai are on the list,” the Civil Aviation Administration of China said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-easing-wuhan-lockdown-fight-continues-against-imported-covid-19-cases/story-ovUVePAOCef6CU4ySzP8YN.html

The trip comes despite the coronavirus pandemic, at a time when world leaders and statesmen are curtailing official travel.Since the signing of the deal, the peace process has become stalled amid political turmoil in Afghanistan, with the country’s leaders squabbling over who was elected president.President Ashraf Ghani and his main rival in last September’s presidential polls, Abdullah Abdullah, have both declared themselves the country’s president in dueling inauguration ceremonies earlier this month.During his visit Monday, Pompeo is expected to try to help end the impasse, which has put on hold the start of intra-Afghan peace talks that would include the Taliban. Those talks are seen as a critical next step in the peace deal, negotiated to allow the United States to bring home its troops and give Afghans the best chance at peace.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pompeo-rushes-to-kabul-to-jumpstart-flagging-peace-process-amid-coronavirus-restrictions/story-0fwchpnQCaZCpGQUMjJr0I.html

The Bhutan government said only essential supplies such as food, medicines and fuel would be allowed into the country, and returning Bhutanese nationals would be quarantined.The Bhutan king told nationals studying or working abroad “not to worry”.Nepal too completely sealed its land borders with India at 10 am on Monday. The decision was made at a cabinet meeting held on Sunday.India and Nepal had earlier decide to keep four border checkpoints operational, but Nepalese authorities had expressed concern about the “largely unrestricted” movement of nationals of both countries through not only the four checkpoints but also through other crossings along the 1,800-km border that is largely unmanned, The Kathmandu Post reported.With India reporting a steady rise in Covid-19 cases, Nepalese nationals living and working in Indian cities had started to return, “stoking concerns [about whether] they were properly screened before entering Nepal”, the Post reported.“With all flights to Nepal suspended, health experts had said that the only way the coronavirus could now enter Nepal, if it has not already, was via the open border with India,” the report said.With the week-long suspension of all international flights to India, Indian missions began extending support to nationals stranded in various cities.Officials of the Indian mission in Kuala Lumpur are continuing to help Indians stranded while in transit at the Kuala Lumpur airport. The mission’s Twitter handle said they were being provided food and medicines day and night with the support of the Malaysian foreign ministry and Malaysian Airlines.Several members of a group of more than 50 Indian students who had sought shelter at the Indian high commission in London were moved to hotels and hostels, people familiar with developments said. Some of them were still in the mission, they added.India also sent a consignment of 40,000 masks and other medical equipment to Italy, the country that has recorded more Covid-19 deaths than China. Italy had earlier sought assistance from India, including medical supplies.“Reinforcements are coming four our doctors, nurses, socio-health workers. For all women and men struggling in hospitals to save lives,” Italian foreign minister Luigi di Maio said in a Facebook post, adding 40,000 masks had been received from India.The Italian foreign ministry’s Twitter handle posted photos of the supplies sent by India and quoted di Maio as saying: “We are grateful to you for your friendship and generosity in this moment of need.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-covid-19-cases-rise-nepal-and-bhutan-seal-borders-with-india/story-8PjJzNK4pGQoAJHgHNQ4BO.html

Adding to the urgency of the crisis facing many American businesses large and small and individuals and families, US congress failed to agree on a massive $1.8 trillion federal relief and stimulus package Sunday. Negotiations continue however as both sides are keen to find common ground.At least 390 people have died of the coronavirus so far and more than 31,000 people have tested positive including Rand Paul, a Republican senator and a close ally of President Trump, who is now the third American lawmaker infected. Two of his colleagues self-quarantined shortly after.Calling Paul a “great friend”, President Trump said at the daily White House briefing the virus is “getting quite close to home, and it’s a terrible thing that’s going on”. New York City, which had been the president’s home for many decades until recently and continues to host the headquarters of his business operations, now accounts for roughly 5% of the cases worldwide. Mayor Bill de Blasio is calling his city the “epicentre” of the outbreak, with a third of all US cases and two-thirds of all New York state cases.New York is a ghost town compared to the bustling city most residents and visitors have known it for long. All non-essential workers are staying home on orders of the local authorities, shutting down nearly every part and aspect of the city.New York state, California and Washington have been declared as disaster areas enabling greater federal assistance and President Trump said Sunday extra supplies of masks, gowns and respirators are being rushed to them to help them deal with a a crisis that they fear will overwhelm them.Mayor de Blasio first put his city at the center of the global health crisis last Friday as he urged federal government for help citing depleting local resources. “I hate to say this, but it’s true: We are now the epicenter of this crisis,” he had said then, with only 5,000 confirmed cases then.

23-03-2020||World||US axed CDC expert job in China months before coronavirus outbreak: Report||Several months before the coronavirus pandemic began, the Trump administration eliminated a key American public health position in Beijing intended to help detect disease outbreaks in China, Reuters has learned.The American disease expert, a medical epidemiologist embedded in China’s disease control agency, left her post in July, according to four sources with knowledge of the issue. The first cases of the new coronavirus may have emerged as early as November, and as cases exploded, the Trump administration in February chastised China for censoring information about the outbreak and keeping US experts from entering the country to help.“It was heartbreaking to watch,” said Bao-Ping Zhu, a Chinese American who served in that role, which was funded by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, between 2007 and 2011. “If someone had been there, public health officials and governments across the world could have moved much faster.”Zhu and the other sources said the American expert, Dr. Linda Quick, was a trainer of Chinese field epidemiologists who were deployed to the epicenter of outbreaks to help track, investigate and contain diseases. As an American CDC employee, they said, Quick was in an ideal position to be the eyes and ears on the ground for the United States and other countries on the coronavirus outbreak, and might have alerted them to the growing threat weeks earlier.No other foreign disease experts were embedded to lead the program after Quick left in July, according to the sources. Zhu said an embedded expert can often get word of outbreaks early, after forming close relationships with Chinese counterparts.Zhu and the other sources said Quick could have provided real-time information to US and other officials around the world during the first weeks of the outbreak, when they said the Chinese government tamped down on the release of information and provided erroneous assessments.Quick left amid a bitter US trade dispute with China when she learned her federally funded post, officially known as resident adviser to the US Field Epidemiology Training Program in China, would be discontinued as of September, the sources said. The US CDC said it first learned of a “cluster of 27 cases of pneumonia” of unexplained origin in Wuhan, China, on Dec. 31.Since then, the outbreak of the disease known as COVID-19 has spread rapidly worldwide, killing more than 13,600 people, infecting more than 317,000. The epidemic has overwhelmed healthcare systems in some countries, including Italy, and threatens to do so in the United States and elsewhere.During a press briefing on Sunday shortly after this story was first published, President Donald Trump dismissed the Reuters report as similar to other stories regarding the CDC that he described as “100 percent wrong,” without addressing whether the role had been eliminated.US CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield maintained the agency’s presence in China “is actually being augmented as we speak,” without elaborating. In a statement to Reuters before the report was published, the CDC said the elimination of the adviser position did not hinder Washington’s ability to get information and “had absolutely nothing to do with CDC not learning of cases in China earlier.”The agency said its decision not to have a resident adviser “started well before last summer and was due to China’s excellent technical capability and maturity of the program.”The CDC said it has assigned two of its Chinese employees as “mentors” to help with the training program. The agency did not respond to questions about the mentors’ specific role or expertise.The CDC would not make Quick, who still works for the agency, available for comment.Asked for comment on Chinese transparency and responsiveness to the outbreak, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs referred Reuters to remarks by spokesman Geng Shuang on Friday. Geng said the country “has adopted the strictest, most comprehensive, and most thorough prevention and control measures in an open, transparent, and responsible manner, and informed the (World Health Organization) and relevant countries and regions of the latest situation in a timely manner.”One disease expert told Reuters he was skeptical that the US resident adviser would have been able to get earlier or better information to the Trump administration, given the Chinese government’s suppression of information.“In the end, based on circumstances in China, it probably wouldn’t have made a big difference,” Scott McNabb, who was a CDC epidemiologist for 20 years and is now a research professor at Emory University. “The problem was how the Chinese handled it. What should have changed was the Chinese should have acknowledged it earlier and didn’t.”ALERT FROM CHINA’S CDCAlex Azar, secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) said on Friday that his agency learned of the coronavirus in early January, based on Redfield’s conversations with “Chinese colleagues.”Redfield learned that “this looks to be a novel coronavirus” from Dr. Gao Fu, the head of the China CDC, according to an HHS administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “Dr. Redfield always talked to Dr. Gao,” the official said.HHS and CDC did not make Azar or Redfield available for comment.Zhu and other sources said US leaders should not have been relying on the China CDC director for alerts and updates. In general, they said, officials in China downplayed the severity of the outbreak in the early weeks and did not acknowledge evidence of person-to-person transmission until Jan. 20.After the epidemic exploded and China had imposed strict quarantines, Trump administration officials complained that the Chinese had censored information about the outbreak and that the United States had been unable to get American disease experts into the country to help contain the spread.Azar told CNN on Feb. 14 that he and CDC director Redfield officially offered to send a CDC team into China on Jan. 6 but still had not received permission for them to enter the country. HHS oversees the CDC.“Dr. Redfield and I made the offer on January 6th - 36 days ago, 60,000 cases and 1,300 deaths ago,” Azar said. “We made the offer to send the CDC experts in to assist their Chinese colleagues to get to the bottom of key scientific questions like, how transmissible is this disease? What is the severity? What is the incubation period and can there be asymptomatic transmission?”Days later, the World Health Organization secured permission to send a team that included two US experts. The team visited between Feb. 16th and 24th. By then, China had reported more than 75,000 cases.On Feb. 25, the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak at home, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused China of mishandling the epidemic through its “censorship” of medical professionals and media.Relations between the two countries have deteriorated since then, as Trump has labeled the coronavirus the “Chinese virus” - a description the Chinese have condemned as stigmatizing. Last week, the Chinese government announced that Americans from three US news organizations, The New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal, would be expelled from China. ONCE ‘FRIENDS,’ NOW RIVALSThe decision to eliminate Quick’s job came as the CDC has scaled back the number of US staffers in China over the last two years, the sources told Reuters.“We had already withdrawn many technical public health experts,” the same expert said.The CDC, however, disputed that staffing was a problem or that its information had been limited by the move. “It was not the staffing shortage that limited our ability” it said.The US CDC team in Beijing now includes three American citizens in permanent roles, an additional American who is temporary and around 10 Chinese nationals, the agency said. Of the Americans, one is an influenza expert with expertise in respiratory disease. COVID-19 is not influenza, though it can cause severe respiratory illness.The CDC team, aside from Quick, was housed at US Embassy facilities. No American CDC staffer besides Quick was embedded with China’s disease control agency, the sources said.China in recent weeks has reported a dramatic slowdown in new cases, the result of drastic containment measures including the lockdown of Hubei province, home to 60 million people.Nevertheless, the infectious disease experts who spoke with Reuters said, the United States could use people like Quick with contacts on the ground, especially if fears of a second wave of infections materializes.Thomas R. Frieden, a former director of the CDC, said that if the US resident adviser had still been in China, “it is possible that we would know more today about how this coronavirus is spreading and what works best to stop it.”Dr. George Conway, a medical epidemiologist who knows Quick and had served as resident advisor between 2012 and 2015, said funding for the position had been tenuous for years because of a perennial debate among U.S health officials over whether China should be paying for funding its own training program.Yet since the training program was launched in 2001, the sources familiar with it say, it has not only strengthened the ranks of Chinese epidemiologists in the field, but also fostered collegial relationships between public health officials in the two countries.“We go there as credentialed diplomats and return home as close colleagues and often as friends,” Conway said.In 2007, Dr. Robert Fontaine, a CDC epidemiologist and one of the longest serving US officials in the adviser’s position, received China’s highest honor for outstanding contributions to public health due to his contribution as a foreigner in helping to detect and investigate clusters of pneumonia of unknown cause.But since last year, Frieden and others said, growing tensions between the Trump administration and China’s leadership have apparently damaged the collaboration.“The message from the administration was, ‘Don’t work with China, they’re our rival,’” Frieden said.Trump’s re-election campaign sent out a statement Sunday evening dismissing controversy about the CDC’S cut as a matter of politics. “Democrats are eager to politicize the coronavirus crisis and weaponize it against President Trump, the statement said. “In so doing, they’re siding with the Chinese and providing cover for Beijing’s cover-up.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-axed-cdc-expert-job-in-china-months-before-coronavirus-outbreak-report/story-KUXfUs3tlrhLwkwG5aXRvI.html
23-03-2020||World||‘Could’ve told us earlier’: Trump slams China’s handling of coronavirus||President Donald Trump has hit out at China for being “very secretive” in sharing information on its coronavirus outbreak that has claimed over 13,000 lives globally, asserting that the US and the world would have been better prepared if Beijing gave an “advance warning” about the impending crisis. Speaking at a press briefing here on Saturday, Trump denied reports that the US intelligence reports in January and February had warned of a coming pandemic, saying America did not know about the outbreak until it started coming out publicly. “Just so you understand, China is not a beneficiary here. China has thousands and thousands of people. China has gone through hell over this. They’ve gone through hell. I’ve had conversations with (Chinese) President Xi (Jinping). I just wish they could have told us earlier. They knew they had a problem earlier. I wish they could have said that,” Trump said. For more than a week now, Trump has been addressing the White House press on a daily basis, with each briefing running for more than an hour every day. “China was very secretive (on coronavirus). Very, very secretive. And that’s unfortunate,” he told reporters. Trump reiterated that he greatly respects China and shares a very good relationship with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, but expressed his disappointment that Beinjing was dishonest and slow to alert the world about the seriousness of coronavirus. “I have great respect for that country. I have great respect for the leader of that country and like him. He’s a friend of mine. But I wish they would have told us earlier, that they were having a problem,” he said. “Because they were having a big problem and they knew it, and I wish they could have given us an advance warning. Because we could have done a lot of things - as an example, some of the things that we’re talking about, where we order them as quickly as we can. If we had a two- or three-month difference in time, it would have been much better,” Trump said. As per latest figures available at Worldometers, the United States with 26,686 confirmed cases has emerged as the third most coronavirus infected country after China (81,054) and Italy (53,578). A total of 340 deaths have been reported in the US, the sixth worst affected country in terms of fatalities after Italy (4,825), China (3,261), Iran (1,556), Spain (1,378) and France (562). Trump insisted that the US and the world would have been better prepared but for the more timely information from China. Trump rejected a report in a leading US daily claiming he had repeatedly ignored warnings as early as January and February that coronavirus could present a huge problem. “We didn’t know about it until it started coming out publicly, but I wish they could have told us earlier about it because we could have come up with a solution,” said the president. China, at the same time, he said, has worked very hard. China has lost thousands and thousands of people, he said. In a tweet, former National Security Advisor John Bolton said that China silenced coronavirus whistleblowers, expelled journalists, destroyed samples, refused CDC help, and concealed counts of deaths and infections. It is a fact there was a massive coverup. China is responsible, he said. “The world must act to hold them accountable,” Bolton demanded. However, the Democratic leadership did not agree with Trump’s explaination. “We need to bring people together to fight coronavirus. Blaming China may seem like good politics, but it doesn’t solve anything, or mitigate the Trump Administration’s failures,” said Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff. “Calling it the ‘Chinese virus’ only breeds disunity, discrimination and division. Enough already,” said Schiff, Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in a tweet early this week alleged that the president had been turning to racist rhetoric to distract from his failures to take the coronavirus early on. Trump criticised China over the coronavirus this week, saying Beijing should have acted sooner to warn the world and dismissing criticism that his labelling it the “Chinese Virus” was racist. The Trump administration has rejected attempts by Chinese officials to blame the virus on the US military. Globally, the death toll from the virus has risen to 13,048 with more than 307,277 cases reported in over 165 countries and territories, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/could-ve-told-us-earlier-trump-slams-china-s-handling-of-coronavirus/story-oFgDqzHRG9GBRmfgJnd0hI.html
23-03-2020||World||US senator Rand Paul tests positive for Covid-19||Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky has tested positive for the novel coronavirus, becoming the first case of COVID-19 in the Senate and raising fears about the further transmission of the virus among Republicans at the Capitol.Paul, an eye surgeon, went into quarantine Sunday after learning his results. He said he has not had symptoms and was tested out of an abundance of caution due to his extensive travel and events. He said he was not aware of any direct contact with any infected person.His announcement led Utah’s two GOP senators — Mike Lee and Mitt Romney — to place themselves into quarantine, stepping away from negotiations as the Senate worked on a $1.4 trillion economic rescue package for the coronavirus crisis. At least five senators, including Paul, were in self-quarantine Sunday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said.“The coronavirus has hit the Senate today,’‘ said McConnell, R-Ky. “It’s not just back in our states but right here in the Senate.’‘Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat from Arizona elected in 2018, chastised Paul on Twitter, saying his decision to return to the Capitol after he was tested — but before he learned the results — was “absolutely irresponsible.’‘Sinema said she has “never commented about a fellow Senator’s choices/actions. Never once.’‘But she added: “This, America, is absolutely irresponsible. You cannot be near other people while waiting for coronavirus test results. It endangers others & likely increases the spread of the virus.’‘Other senators, including Ted Cruz of Texas and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, had gone into self-quarantine while they awaited the results of a coronavirus test. Both were negative.Responding to criticism on Twitter, Paul’s office said, “We want to be clear, Senator Paul left the Senate IMMEDIATELY upon learning of his diagnosis. He had zero contact with anyone & went into quarantine. Insinuations ... that he went to the gym after learning of his results are just completely false & irresponsible!’‘Paul’s office did not say when he was tested. Representatives of his office could not immediately be reached for comment.President Donald Trump called Paul “a great friend” and said he’s “always there when we needed him.’‘Paul’s diagnosis came after two House members, Reps. Mario Diaz Balart, R-Fla., and Ben McAdams, D-Utah, tested positive for the virus. Trump said the positive test results showed the virus was “hitting quite close to home. It’s a terrible thing that’s going on.’‘Paul and other lawmakers “are going to be fine,’‘ Trump said. ”I hope they’ll be fine.’‘Paul, a deficit hawk, was among eight Senate Republicans who voted against a House-passed bill last week that provided more than $100 billion to boost testing for the coronavirus and guarantee paid sick leave for millions of workers. He also was only Republican senator who opposed an earlier bill authorizing $8.3 billion for initial response to the coronavirus.The senator was on Capitol Hill this past week, including at a luncheon Friday among GOP senators. He spoke on the Senate floor on Wednesday afternoon, addressing the cornonavirus and a failed amendment he sponsored that would have paid for virus relief efforts by withdrawing U.S. forces from Afghanistan.A spokesman for Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kan., said Moran briefly saw Paul at the Senate gym Sunday morning and that he shared that information with GOP colleagues at a policy meeting. Moran “followed CDC guidelines and kept a safe distance between him and Sen. Paul,’‘ spokesman Tom Brandt said. Moran has spoken with the attending physician at the Capitol and has been told he does not need to self-quarantine, Brandt said.South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the second-ranking Republican senator, said on the Senate floor that lawmakers will consult with the attending physician about all senators who have been in contact with Paul.Romney said he was praying for Paul and noted that Paul’s health is compromised. Paul, 57, broke several ribs in 2017 when a neighbor assaulted him over a long-standing landscaping dispute. Paul, who was later awarded $580,000 in damages and medical expenses, had surgery last year to remove part of a lung damaged by the assault.The Senate was in session Sunday seeking a bipartisan response to the pandemic. If approved, the bill would be the third measure Congress has approved in response to the coronavirus this month.The White House has increasingly emphasized that testing should prioritize the elderly and health care workers who have symptoms of the virus. While most cases of COVID-19 are mild and tens of thousands of people have recovered, older people and those with underlying health problems are at higher risk for more serious problems, such as pneumonia.“We don’t want everyone to go out and get a test because there’s no reason for it,” Trump told reporters Friday.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tells people to seek testing if they have certain symptoms of the flu-like illness caused by the coronavirus — fever, cough and trouble breathing — and if they have traveled recently to an outbreak area or have been in close contact with someone who is infected. They should first be tested for the flu and other routine infections.The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-senator-rand-paul-tests-positive-for-covid-19/story-oRaZ2Q6ZYUW9QUeYqDVpiO.html
23-03-2020||World||Queen moved out of Buckingham Palace as royal aide tests Covid-19+ve: Report||A royal aide at Buckingham Palace has reportedly tested positive for the coronavirus while Queen Elizabeth II was still at her London residence.The 93-year-old monarch shifted out of the palace to Windsor Castle indefinitely on Thursday as a “precaution” after all her engagements were cancelled and reports are that she is healthy. According to UK media reports, it is not known how close the royal aide in question would have got to the Queen but every member of Royal Household staff the person came into contact with has since been placed under self-isolation.“The worker tested positive before the Queen left for Windsor. But the Palace has 500 members of staff so, like any workplace, it’s not inconceivable it would be affected in some stage,” ‘The Sun’ quoted a royal source as saying.The aide, who has not been named, is believed to have taken ill and tested positive for the deadly virus earlier last week.Buckingham Palace has declined to comment on the reports but said that it was taking all necessary steps in light of the advisory in place for the COVID-19 pandemic, which has been rapidly spreading in the UK as the death toll rose to 233 on Saturday.“We wouldn’t comment on individual members of staff. In line with the appropriate guidance and our own processes, we have taken the necessary actions to protect all employees and people involved,” a palace spokesperson said.There are some reports that the monarch is preparing to deliver a live television broadcast in the coming days as a morale boost for the public during the ongoing crisis, which has put Britain into a near shutdown with all social venues closed indefinitely and people advised to stay indoors and follow strict social distancing rules.Earlier this week, the Queen had issued a statement of support and called on people to find new ways of staying in touch to get through the lockdown.“Many of us will need to find new ways of staying in touch with each other and making sure that loved ones are safe. I am certain we are up to that challenge,” read the Queen’s statement, which said that she and the royal family “stand ready” to play their part.“We are enormously thankful for the expertise and commitment of our scientists, medical practitioners and emergency and public services; but now more than any time in our recent past, we all have a vitally important part to play as individuals – today and in the coming days, weeks and months,” she said.The Queen, who turns 94 on April 21, is set to be based at Windsor Castle in south-east England with her 98-year-old husband Prince Philip for an extended period following consultation with her medical experts and the UK government. Her regular “audiences” with Prime Minister Boris Johnson are set to continue for now but Buckingham Palace said that as a “sensible precaution and for practical reasons”, a number of other changes are being made to the rest of her diary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/queen-moved-out-of-buckingham-palace-as-royal-aide-tests-covid-19-ve-report/story-4bqz81d2VHVczI7Cs7rYEO.html
23-03-2020||World||Coronavirus update: German Chancellor Angela Merkel quarantined||Chancellor Angela Merkel was on Sunday in quarantine after meeting a doctor who tested positive for the novel coronavirus, as Germany further tightens rules on public gatherings and plots a taboo-breaking package of support for Europe’s top economy.News of Merkel’s potential exposure to the virus came minutes after she announced a ban on public gatherings of more than two people and further infection control measures.“The Chancellor has decided to quarantine herself immediately at home. She will be tested regularly in the coming days... (and) fulfil her official business from home,” spokesman Steffen Seibert said in a statement.Merkel had been slated to lead a cabinet meeting Monday to sign off on a 822-billion-euro ($882 billion) slew of measures to support Europe’s top economy through the shutdowns of public life designed to slow the infection’s spread.The infected doctor visited Merkel on Friday to vaccinate her against the pneumococcus bacteria.It could take some days to determine whether the 65-year-old chancellor is herself infected as “a test would not yet be fully conclusive,” Seibert said.Merkel showed no apparent symptoms of ill health in Sunday’s televised press conference.During her 15-year term in office the chancellor has largely enjoyed robust health, although she suffered repeated shaking spells in public appearances during a summer 2019 heatwave that were never fully explained.In response to the tremors, she chose to sit on a chair when receiving guests with military honours outside the chancellor’s office in Berlin.Previously the veteran leader broke her pelvis in a cross-country skiing accident in 2014.It was not immediately clear whether Merkel will isolate herself in a rarely-used official residence in the top floor of the chancellery building or at her personal flat in Berlin’s museum district.Wearing one of her trademark block-colour blazers, she had been seen doing her own shopping at a local supermarket late Saturday, buying items including wine and toilet paper.If conservative leader Merkel were incapacitated, her role would be filled by vice-chancellor and finance minister Olaf Scholz of her junior coalition partners, the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD).Scholz last week isolated himself at home with a heavy cold, but tweeted a day later that he had tested negative for the coronavirus.Earlier Sunday, Merkel had announced still-tighter restrictions on public gatherings after a telephone conference with regional leaders that aimed to get Germany’s 16 federal states into a common policy.The closure of schools and non-essential shops had already been announced.Businesses like massage studios and hairdressers where people come into close contact will also be shut.And restaurants will be closed across Germany except for takeaway food.The measures slated to last initially for two weeks, will be imposed by individual states, which will decide when to roll them out.Merkel appealed to citizens’ “reason and empathy” in implementing the contact restrictions, saying she had been “very moved” by how closely people had stuck to less stringent measures implemented in recent days.The Robert Koch Institute, Germany’s disease control authority, said early Sunday the number of confirmed coronavirus cases had grown by almost 2,000 in the previous 24 hours, to 18,610.So far 55 Germans have died of the disease.Germany’s all-out support to the economy on the cabinet agenda Monday includes hundreds of billions of euros in potential support for companies and workers.Much of it will come in the form of state guarantees for bank loans to business and easier access to short-time working and unemployment benefits.But Berlin also plans to blow through a constitutional rule that limits the size of the federal budget deficit in any one year, with around 156 billion euros in new borrowing.Ending the crisis “comes first”, Merkel has said, adding “we will see at the end of that where our budget stands”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-german-chancellor-angela-merkel-quarantined/story-QxghOiDZfZPZWIoeLKMw3M.html
