Italy has the taken the most brutal knock from the outbreak and has seen stringent measures put in place by the government. “Usually, when I look out of my balcony on the Via dei Coronari (a popular street), I can see life every day - people, tourists, cardinals from the Vatican. Now, it is all dead,” says Rosalia, who sorely misses going out for a walk in her neighbourhood.Life is no better in Spain, which reported more than 400 deaths over the last 24 hours. The grim numbers and the lockdown across Spain has made anxiety levels run high.“My parents love watching the news every day and it ends up causing more stress and anxiety,” says Cristina Dorda, a 29-year-old real estate agent from Madrid, about the impact of news of the pandemic. “They (my parents) are afraid of everything that gets into the house.”This anxiousness about the situation is being felt in France as well, where over 650 people have succumbed to the deadly infection - triggering a lockdown typical of several other countries.France has been in lockdown mode since March 17, leaving many Frenchmen claustrophobic at times. “You get a bit paranoid about whether you’re sick or not,” says French student Lola Kleinfinger. “My best friend’s grandfather tested positive. We’re worried about him since he’s not in good shape. He was contaminated by his caregiver.”Lola has been confined to her family home in Brittany in northwest France, where she was on a visit when the lockdown was announced. Her family is in Paris.But it’s not all gloom and doom as many Europeans are seeing a silver lining to the new normal - a remarkable improvement in the air quality across urban Europe. “It’s amazing to breathe clean air again,” says Madrid-based Dorda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-update-amid-lockdowns-over-coronavirus-europeans-miss-la-dolce-vita/story-S4v7Gxyk332mHo43mx41BJ.html
24-03-2020||World||UK wakes up to total lockdown to enforce social distancing||As new deaths and cases of coronavirus emerge, the UK woke up on Tuesday to a nation-wide lockdown after Prime Minister Boris Johnson, alarmed at people not taking social distancing seriously, announced new curbs, allowing people to leave homes for only four specified reasons.Declaring the situation created by the coronavirus pandemic as a ‘national emergency’, Johnson said the police will have powers to enforce the curbs described as ‘the toughest in living memory’; they are similar to those introduced recently in France and other European countries.Coronavirus-related deaths and cases in the UK continued to mount: 422 deaths and 8,077 cases as on Tuesday. Health officials are expecting and gearing up for an Italy-like spike in the near future.Setting out the curbs to last three weeks, Johnson said in a TV address on Monday: “From this evening I must give the British people a very simple instruction - you must stay at home. Because the critical thing we must do is stop the disease spreading between households”.“That is why people will only be allowed to leave their home for the following very limited purposes: shopping for basic necessities, as infrequently as possible; one form of exercise a day - for example a run, walk, or cycle - alone or with members of your household; any medical need, to provide care or to help a vulnerable person; and travelling to and from work, but only where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be done from home”.“That’s all - these are the only reasons you should leave your home”, he said, imposing restrictions the likes of which the UK with a long history of struggles for liberty, freedom of movement and civil rights has never seen.However, the challenge to enforce social distancing remained. On Tuesday, commuters posted images of crowds on London Underground, and police officials pondered whether they have enough personnel and powers to ensure that social distancing is obeyed.Besides the closure of pubs, restaurants and theatres announced last week, Johnson said authorities will also close shops selling non-essential goods, including clothing and electronic stores and other premises including libraries, playgrounds and outdoor gyms, and places of worship.Johnson said: “No Prime Minister wants to enact measures like this. I know the damage that this disruption is doing and will do to people’s lives, to their businesses and to their jobs…And I can assure you that we will keep these restrictions under constant review”.“We will look again in three weeks, and relax them if the evidence shows we are able to. But at present there are just no easy options. The way ahead is hard, and it is still true that many lives will sadly be lost”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-wakes-up-to-total-lockdown-to-enforce-social-distancing/story-YkZ4wRmbyPuEiNzxhkK9DK.html

Most patients currently receive only supportive care such as breathing assistance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gilead-s-potential-coronavirus-treatment-gets-fda-s-orphan-drug-label/story-gTWg8f9ClWRrY7lMt8EmAK.html

As world economies struggle to find ways to tackle the menace, one of the prime challenges is to counter the spread of misinformation and scams around Covid-19.In one such attempt, the US Justice Department on Sunday acted against a case of coronavirus fraud and took down a scam website that was offering consumers access to World Health Organization (WHO) vaccine kits in exchange for a shipping charge of $4.95. In an official release, the US Justice Department said the operators of the website “coronavirusmedicalkit.com” were engaged “in a wire fraud scheme seeking to profit from the confusion and widespread fear surrounding COVID-19”.Justice Department Files Its First Enforcement Action against COVID-19 Fraud https://t.co/3A37F5a5xf“Information published on the website claimed to offer consumers access to World Health Organization (WHO) vaccine kits in exchange for a shipping charge of $4.95, which consumers would pay by entering their credit card information on the website,” the release noted.“We will use every resource at the government’s disposal to act quickly to shut down these most despicable of scammers, whether they are defrauding consumers, committing identity theft, or delivering malware,” Assistant Attorney General Jody Hunt of the Department of Justice’s Civil Division said.According to a report by news agency Associated Press, scamsters are targeting the elderly by peddling fake Covid-19 tests to Medicare recipients.Alerting seniors to fraud, the Health and Human Services inspector general’s office said it has seen marketing schemes rapidly pivot to offering tests for COVID-19 and “Senior Care Packages” with hand sanitizer or even tout a vaccine, which doesn’t exist. Some marketers falsely claim that Trump has ordered that seniors get tested.“It’s a straight-up ruse to get your Medicare number or your Social Security number under the guise of having a test kit or a sanitary kit sent to you,” said Christian Schrank, assistant inspector general for investigations.The total number of confirmed Covid-19 infections across the globe stands at 334,981 with 14,652 deaths globally as per the data from the World Health Organisation.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-update-website-selling-fake-coronavirus-vaccine-kits-shuts-down/story-kDV0gjsmtcaFS43krPjEdM.html
24-03-2020||World||‘America will soon be open for business’: Trump indicates early end to Covid-19 shutdown||President Donald Trump on Monday indicated he is considering ending restrictions in place to deal with the coronavirus and declaring the country “open for business” again even as the US toll jumped by 100 in a day for the first time and his medical experts warned the virus was spreading at an alarming rate in New York city, the new epicentre of the global outbreak.“Our country wasn’t built to be shut down,” Trump said at the daily White House briefing. “America will again and soon be open for business.”He gave no timeline for when he plans to do it but indicated he is looking at weeks and not months. A decision could be taken early next week, at the end of the 15-day period set by the administration to slow down the pandemic.More on Covid-19:• Your guide to staying safe• What you need to know today• How difficult it is to maintain 1-metre distance• How coronavirus is different from seasonal flu and common coldAsked if his medical experts were on board, specially Dr Anthony Fauci, the head epidemiologist at the National Institutes of Health who has emerged as the single-most trusted member of the White House task force spearheading US response, the president dodged a direct reply: “He does not agree.” Dr Deborah Birx, the other medical expert on the team, said she wants to see the data before weighing in.Trump is arguing for an early end to restrictions based on a mix of factors as cited by him in the two-hour-long new briefing: The mortality rate has not been as alarming as was initially feared, and the people and the country stood to lose more because of the shutdown than the illness.There is also an argument, first presented by Dr Davit Katz, lead epidemiologist at Yale university, that focussing on the most vulnerable population, the elderly and those with underlying conditions, was a better alternative to locking down the entire country to protect everyone. “A pivot right now from trying to protect all people to focusing on the most vulnerable remains entirely plausible,” Katz argued in an Op-Ed in the New York Times. “With each passing day, however, it becomes more difficult.”Close to 44,000 Americans have tested positive for Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, and more than 550 have died as of Monday, an increase of more than 100 over the previous day, a stark reminder of the growing - not declining - public health crisis facing the United States. New York state is the worst hit with almost half of the positive cases countrywide, and the New York City and the region around it is the epicentre with the most alarming rate of spread.Dr Birx said the New York metro area - the NYC region - was witnessing a virus “attack rate” of one in thousand, with is way above anywhere else in the United States. “So to all of my friends and colleagues in New York, this is the group that needs to absolutely social distance and self-isolate at this time,” Dr Birx said. “Clearly, the virus had been circulating there for a number of weeks to have this level of penetrance into the general community.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/america-will-soon-be-open-for-business-trump-indicates-early-end-to-covid-19-shutdown/story-6SYAZIdxqD0ERDS2yf87JM.html
24-03-2020||World||US slashes aid to Afghanistan by $1bn over rival leaders’ failure to agree on govt formation||The Trump administration is slashing $1 billion in assistance to Afghanistan and threatening further reductions in all forms of cooperation after the country’s rival leaders failed to agree on forming a new government.The decision to cut the aid was made on Monday by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo after he made an unannounced, urgent visit to Kabul to meet with Ashraf Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah, the rival Afghan politicians who have each declared themselves president of the country after disputed elections last year. Pompeo had hoped to break the deadlock but was unable to.In an unusually harsh statement, Pompeo slammed the two men for being unable to work together and threatening a potential peace deal that could end America’s longest-running conflict. The U.S. has been the prime backer of the Afghan government since it invaded the country in 2001 and overthrew the Taliban after the 9/11 attacks.“The United States deeply regrets that Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and former Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah have informed Secretary Pompeo that they have been unable to agree on an inclusive government that can meet the challenges of governance, peace, and security, and provide for the health and welfare of Afghan citizens,” he said.Pompeo said the U.S. was “disappointed” in both men and their conduct, which he said had “harmed U.S.-Afghan relations and, sadly, dishonors those Afghan, Americans, and coalition partners who have sacrificed their lives and treasure in the struggle to build a new future for this country.”Pompeo said their inability to work together posed a “direct threat” to U.S. national interests and that the administration would begin an immediate review of all its support programs for Afghanistan, starting with a reduction of $1 billion in aid this year. He said it could be reduced by another billion dollars in 2021.“We have made clear to the leadership that we will not back security operations that are politically motivated, nor support political leaders who order such operations or those who advocate for or support parallel government,” Pompeo said.Speaking to reporters aboard his plane on the return flight home, Pompeo said he was hopeful Ghani and Abdullah “will get their act together and we won’t have to” cut the assistance. “But we’re prepared to do that,” he said. He defended his written statement from interpretations that it is overly harsh saying it “is neither hopeful nor threatening. It is factual. These are the expectations that we have.”Pompeo, who after leaving Kabul met with a senior Taliban official in Qatar, also said Ghani and Abdullah were acting inconsistent with agreements they made to support a U.S.-Taliban peace agreement signed last month. That deal called for intra-Afghan peace talks to begin within 10 days, by March 10, but they have not begun. Ghani and Abdullah have not yet even agreed on who should be part of the non-Taliban delegation nor have they agreed to prisoner swaps with the Taliban as envisaged by the deal.“It’s all gotta come together,” Pompeo said. Asked if the Taliban had also been acting “inconsistently” with the agreement, he replied: “No. They committed to reducing violence and they’ve largely done that and they are working towards delivering their team to the ultimate negotiations.”Pompeo said the United States would continue to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan under the terms of its agreement with Taliban, which calls for the reduction in the next several months from about 13,000 to 8,600.Pompeo added that the U.S. would be willing to look again at the aid cuts if the two leaders can form an inclusive government and said Washington remained committed to partnership with the people of Afghanistan. As a demonstration of that, he said, the U.S. would provide $15 million in assistance to help Afghanistan fight the spread of the coronavirus.Pompeo had left Afghanistan earlier Monday without saying whether he was able to broker an agreement between the squabbling political leaders. He’d traveled thousands of miles despite a near-global travel shutdown because of the coronavirus pandemic, at a time when world leaders and statesmen are curtailing official travel.But as he departed the was no sign the impasse was over and there were reports in Kabul that Pompeo had given Ghani and Abdullah until Tuesday to come up with a compromise.From Kabul, Pompeo flew to Doha, Qatar, where he had witnessed the signing of the U.S.-Taliban deal on Feb. 29, to meet Taliban officials, including Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, a co-founder of the Taliban and head of their political office in Qatar. Baradar signed the agreement on behalf of the group. The State Department said Pompeo’s aim was “to press the Taliban to continue to comply with the agreement signed last month.”Since the U.S.-Taliban deal was signed, the peace process has stalled amid political turmoil in Afghanistan, as Ghani and Abdullah remained deadlocked over who was elected president in last September’s presidential polls. They both declared themselves president in dueling inauguration ceremonies earlier this month.Pompeo had met separately with Ghani and then Abdullah on Monday before meeting together with both men together.The United States pays billions every year toward the Afghan budget, including the country’s defense forces. Afghanistan barely raises a quarter of the revenue it needs to run the country, giving Pompeo considerable financial leverage to force the two squabbling leaders to overcome the impasse.The political turmoil has put on hold the start of intra-Afghan peace talks that would include the Taliban. Those talks are seen as a critical next step in the peace deal, negotiated to allow the United States to bring home its troops and give Afghans the best chance at peace.The U.S. and NATO have already begun to withdraw some troops from Afghanistan. The final pullout of U.S. forces is not dependent on the success of intra-Afghan negotiations but rather on promises made by the Taliban to deny space in Afghanistan to other terror groups, such as the insurgents’ rival Islamic State group.But within days of the U.S. and the Taliban signing the peace deal in Qatar, Afghanistan sunk into a political crisis with Ghani and Abdullah squaring off over election results and Ghani refusing to fulfill his part of a promise made in the U.S.-Taliban deal to free up to 5,000 Taliban prisoners. The insurgents were to free 1,000 Afghan officials and soldiers they hold captive. The exchange was meant to be a goodwill gesture by both sides to start the negotiations.The urgency of Pompeo’s surprise visit was highlighted by the fact that the State Department has warned American citizens against all international travel, citing the spread of the coronavirus. Pompeo’s last overseas trip in late February was to Doha for the signing of the U.S.-Taliban peace deal he is now trying to salvage.Pompeo’s visit was also extraordinary for the fact that the U.S., like the United Nations, had earlier said it would not be drawn into mediating feuding Afghan politicians as it did in 2014 presidential polls. While the Afghan election commission this time gave the win to Ghani, Abdullah and the election complaints commission charged widespread irregularities to challenge Ghani’s win____Associated Press writers Rahim Faiez in Kabul and Kathy Gannon in Islamabad contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-slashes-aid-to-afghanistan-by-1bn-over-rival-leaders-failure-to-agree-on-govt-formation/story-CbYRZBWqCraCvde6Zq4HCK.html
