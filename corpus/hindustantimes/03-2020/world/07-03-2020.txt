It was not clear how tall the building had been before it collapsed, but there appeared to be commercial properties at street level.The building collapsed at about 7:30 p.m. (1130 GMT) and 34 people were rescued in the following two hours, the Quanzhou authorities said.The official People’s Daily said the hotel had opened in June 2018 with 80 rooms and was being used to quarantine people during the coronavirus outbreak.The Fujian provincial government said that as of Friday, the province had 296 cases of coronavirus and 10,819 people had been placed under observation after being classified as suspected close contacts.No reason was given for the collapse of the hotel.The official Xinhua News Agency said the committee responsible for working safety under the State Council, China’s cabinet, has sent an emergency working team to the site.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/seventy-trapped-in-collapsed-chinese-quarantine-hotel/story-A9mHN8kjQhdV0Ee6P8yPrM.html

07-03-2020||World||Indian-origin scientist developing robots to do tough tasks||Humanoids or robots are in news for taking up certain chores like in restaurants or as cleaners but researchers led by an Indian-origin scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) are now working on robots that can learn new tasks solely by observing humans.The team has designed a system that lets such types of robots learn complicated tasks that would otherwise hinder them with too many confusing rules. One such task is setting a dinner table under certain conditions.At its core, the system gives robots the human-like planning ability to simultaneously weigh many ambiguous -- and potentially contradictory -- requirements to reach an end goal. In their work, the researchers compiled a dataset with information about how eight objects -- a mug, glass, spoon, fork, knife, dinner plate, small plate, and bowl -- could be placed on a table in various configurations. A robotic arm first observed randomly selected human demonstrations of setting the table with the objects. Then, the researchers tasked the arm with automatically setting a table in a specific configuration, in real-world experiments and in simulation, based on what it had seen.To succeed, the robot had to weigh many possible placement orderings, even when items were purposely removed, stacked, or hidden. Normally, all that would confuse robots too much. But the researchers’ robot made no mistakes over several real-world experiments, and only a handful of mistakes over tens of thousands of simulated test runs.“The vision is to put programming in the hands of domain experts, who can program robots through intuitive ways, rather than describing orders to an engineer to add to their code,” said first author Ankit Shah, a graduate student in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AeroAstro) and the Interactive Robotics Group. That way, robots won’t have to perform preprogrammed tasks anymore. “Factory workers can teach a robot to do multiple complex assembly tasks. Domestic robots can learn how to stack cabinets, load the dishwasher, or set the table from people at home,” Shah added.Robots are fine planners in tasks with clear “specifications,” which help describe the task the robot needs to fulfill, considering its actions, environment, and end goal. The researchers’ system, called PUnS (for Planning with Uncertain Specifications), enables a robot to hold a “belief” over a range of possible specifications. The belief itself can then be used to dish out rewards and penalties. “The robot is essentially hedging its bets in terms of what’s intended in a task, and takes actions that satisfy its belief, instead of us giving it a clear specification,” Shah noted.The researchers hope to modify the system to help robots change their behaviour based on verbal instructions, corrections or a user’s assessment of the robot’s performance. “Say a person demonstrates to a robot how to set a table at only one spot. The person may say, ‘do the same thing for all other spots,’ or, ‘place the knife before the fork here instead,’“ Shah added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-origin-scientist-developing-robots-to-do-tough-tasks/story-Y5Q4xqt77xszeJgooTFs7O.html
07-03-2020||World||New daily cases of coronavirus in China fall below 100 in several weeks, death toll now 3070||Chinese health authorities on Saturday said 3070 people had died from the coronavirus outbreak while, for the first time in several weeks, less than 100 new infections were reported from across the country.The epidemic is showing signs of stabilising in China, especially outside the worst-hit Hubei provinces as it rages globally.Chinese authorities continued to strictly screen international airports for infected people coming in or returning to China from abroad.China’s national health commission (NHC) said Saturday 99 cases were reported from the mainland with 74 of those from Wuhan, Hubei province’s capital, from where the epidemic started in December.The commission says it is the first time since January 20 that less than 100 people have been found to be infected in one day.This is the second day that no new case of covid-19 was reported from other parts of the central Chinese province.All the 28 new deaths on Friday were reported from Hubei, with 21 in Wuhan, bringing the death toll to 3070.There are now 80,651 infections in mainland China.According to Wuhan’s local officials, about one-third of residential communities in the city have had no newly confirmed cases in the past two weeks as of Thursday.Outside Hubei, nearly all new infections, or at least 24 of those, were found among people coming in to China.As of Friday, the mainland had reported 60 such cases.Four people who had travelled to Italy tested positive in Beijing, while in Shanghai a person who had been studying in Iran was found to be infected.Authorities said 11 out of 311 people who arrived in Gansu Province from Iran on chartered flights between Monday and Thursday also tested positive.Local governments in Beijing, Shanghai and in the southern province of Guangdong are asking that people arriving from Japan, South Korea, Italy or Iran quarantine themselves at home or elsewhere for 14 days.Meanwhile, a senior WHO official has said that there is no evidence right now suggesting covid-19 will disappear in summer.“We do not know yet what the activity or behavior of the virus will be in different climatic conditions. We have to assume the virus will continue to have the capacity to spread,” Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO Health Emergencies Program said.Ryan urged countries to fight the new virus decisively at the current stage and called on countries and societies to avoid “blame culture” and to do all the things needed to save lives.Meanwhile, a new study has found that mesenchymal (cells that grow into tissues blood and cartilage) stem cell (MSC) therapy could be effective in treating COVID-19, according to research published in the peer-reviewed journal Aging and Disease, state media reported.The study, conducted by a research team led by Robert Chunhua Zhao, a professor from Shanghai University and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, assessed clinical outcomes of seven patients treated with MSC therapy at Beijing You’an Hospital for 14 days.“They found that MSCs could greatly optimise the functional outcomes of the patients without observed adverse effects,” the china.org reported.“The pulmonary function and symptoms of all patients with covid-19 pneumonia were significantly improved two days after MSCs transplantation. Among them, two moderate and one severe patient were recovered and discharged in 10 days after treatment,” the authors wrote in the research paper.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-daily-cases-of-coronavirus-in-china-fall-below-100-in-several-weeks-death-toll-now-3070/story-YDdO8H7PTdpW8UgSuuKmhL.html

Meanwhile, two Chinese patients, including a 10-year-old boy, diagnosed with the deadly coronavirus in the UAE have recovered from the illness, the MoHAP said, adding that the total number of recovered cases in the UAE now stands at seven. The virus that first emerged in China’s Wuhan city in the Hubei province in December last year has spread to 97 countries and has infected 102,180 people, including 80,651 in China, according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus tracker.China has reported 28 new fatalities from the deadly coronavirus outbreak, taking the death toll in the country to 3,070, Chinese health officials said on Saturday.

One of them was a man with underlying health issues in Santa Rosa County, in Florida’s Panhandle, according to the statement.It said the second death was that of an elderly person in the Fort Myers area.Florida also raised on Friday the number of people who have tested positive for COVID-19, the new virus strain, from four to seven.Officials had previously announced five Florida residents who had been traveling in China have also been quarantined elsewhere after testing positive for the virus.Florida authorities are announcing both people who have tested positive for the virus in the state as well as Florida residents who have tested positive elsewhere, and who may be part of other state tallies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/florida-2-dead-in-the-state-who-tested-positive-for-coronavirus/story-OCFVsOIgc40ieQGNvedGnJ.html
07-03-2020||World||‘Completely absurd’: China’s coronavirus control tactics trigger outrage among citizens||An elderly man in virus-hit China pops out to use a public toilet without wearing a compulsory face mask. The next thing he knows, police are ordering him into a van to be taken into quarantine.A video of the incident in the northern province of Hebei has been widely shared on social media amid growing anger over apparently arbitrary measures aimed at stopping the deadly epidemic from spreading.Criticised for their slow response to the virus, which emerged in the central city of Wuhan in December, chastened authorities have gone on the offensive in recent weeks, as the death toll has risen to more than 3,000 with over 80,500 infected in the country.From locking down tens of millions of people at the epicentre of the outbreak to imposing two-week quarantines on anyone who has travelled to virus-affected provinces or countries, officials are pulling out all stops to contain the virus.But there are growing complaints that their efforts are excessive, with neighbourhood committees -- which enforce the orders of the ruling Communist Party -- sometimes accused of going too far.“In my case, they acted in a simplistic and rude manner,” Zhang, a 29-year-old woman in Beijing, told AFP.Zhang was quarantined after her flatmate returned from another province and was banned from even setting foot in the shared corridor.To ensure she obeyed, a notice was stuck on her front door warning neighbours “this person is currently in quarantine. Please watch over them.”“It’s humiliating,” Zhang said.In another case shared on social media, three relatives under lockdown in the hardest-hit province of Hubei were playing mahjong when they were reprimanded by staff enforcing the prevention measures, apparently for being too close to each other.‘Completely absurd’Ge Daye was also quarantined in his home near Beijing on the orders of local officials -- not because he had travelled to a virus-hit area, but because he was born in Hubei.“I haven’t been there for six months,” the 29-year-old said.“They say the measure comes from above and admit themselves that it is not good. But the orders are the orders.”“I understand the politicians. They don’t want to bother” sorting out potentially infected people from the rest, he said.But the approach “is completely absurd”.Faced with growing discontent over its handling of the health crisis, the government is taking action.In a recent editorial, the Communist Party’s mouthpiece the People’s Daily warned against the arbitrary implementation of virus measures.“This will inevitably provoke resentment and opposition from the people,” it said.Beijing city officials also noted recently the existence of “certain problems” of abusive procedures and promised to do better.Nearly one million returnees have had to undergo 14-day quarantine in the capital.In collaboration with hundreds of municipalities, tech giants Alibaba and Tencent have launched mobile apps that use metadata to determine if the user should be isolated.If a QR code shows up green, no problem. Yellow or red means the user is off to quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/completely-absurd-china-s-coronavirus-control-tactics-trigger-outrage-among-citizens/story-M1JyceAvyC7eyuhZTfdtZP.html
07-03-2020||World||Coronavirus: Overall risk to Americans remains low, claims Donald Trump||US President Donald Trump has said the overall risk to the American public from deadly coronavirus remains low.“I think at this point, … the overall risk to the American public does remain low,” Trump told reporters on Friday after he visited Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) headquarters in Atlanta.According to Johns Hopkins coronavirus tracker at least 299 cases of coronavirus have been detected in the US and 14 people have died due to it.The total number of cases globally stands at 101,88 with 3,460 deaths, as per the data compiled by the university. India has reported 31 cases of coronavirus, the university said.Referring to the cases and deaths reported in other countries like China, Trump asserted that coronavirus is under control in the US.“Now, you look at throughout the world, I mean, other countries have--South Korea, Italy, and in particular China, have many. Now, I also hear the numbers are getting much better in those places, and I’ve heard the numbers are getting much better in China. But I hear the numbers are getting much better in Italy,” he said.At a White House news conference later in the day, Vice President Mike Pence said that 21 people aboard a cruise ship held off the coast of California have tested positive for the coronavirus.There were 3,500 people on board the Grand Princess ship anchored near San Francisco.“All passengers and crew will be tested for the coronavirus. Those that need to be quarantined will be quarantined. Those that require an additional medical attention will receive it,” Pence said.“Let me assure the American public as we did so with Americans returning from China and those returning from the other cruise ship we are taking all measures necessary to see to the health of the Americans and those involved on the grand Princess and just as importantly to protect the health of the American public and prevent the spread of the disease through communities in this country,” he said.Pence is leading the efforts of the Trump Administration in containing coronavirus. He has been holding daily meetings and has been addressing joint news conferences with other top officials at the White House. “President Trump has no higher priority than the health and safety of the American people. He’s assembled an extraordinary group of Americans and agencies,” the vice president said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-overall-risk-to-americans-remains-low-claims-donald-trump/story-j8BpD396v8Bxy4RDO7YtVP.html
07-03-2020||World||China responds to report it fired laser at US Navy plane||China’s Defense Ministry says a report one of its navy ships fired a laser last month at a U.S. Navy surveillance plane circling overhead does not “accord with reality.”The report last month was the latest accusation that Chinese forces have used lasers to harass and potentially damage U.S. and other nations’ military aircraft and personnel.However, ministry spokesman Ren Guoqiang was quoted as saying Friday that the ministry “refuted” the report and said a Chinese squadron was conducting routine exercises in international waters on Feb. 17 when the incident allegedly happened.In China’s first pubic comments on the alleged incident, Ren accused an American P-8A Poseidon of carrying out “long-period circling reconnaissance at low-altitude despite repeated warnings from the Chinese side.”“The American aircraft’s behavior was unfriendly in intention and unprofessional by operation, which severely threatened the safety of the vessels, aircraft and crew of both sides,” he said.The U.S. Navy waited more than a week before accusing the Chinese ship of firing a laser at a U.S. surveillance aircraft flying over the Philippine Sea west of Guam, an act the U.S. deemed unsafe and a violation of international codes and agreements. The statement from U.S. Pacific Fleet said the laser was detected by sensors on the aircraft, but was not visible to the naked eye.The Philippine Sea lies far to the north and west of the South China Sea, which China claims virtually in its entirety despite countering claims by others.The U.S. has sought to avoid such incidents with the signing of agreements with China on handling unexpected incidents at sea and in the air, but Beijing has apparently not followed those protocols consistently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-responds-to-report-it-fired-laser-at-us-navy-plane/story-CKaEedQgkJ73wySYNVRkYI.html

Mark Meadows his new chief of staff||Under fire for his handling of the coronavirus crisis, President Donald Trump on Friday announced a major staff overhaul, naming Rep. Mark Meadows as his new chief of staff and replacing Mick Mulvaney, who has been acting in the role for more than a year.Trump announced the surprise staff reshuffle in a series of Friday night tweets, saying Mulvaney would become the U.S. special envoy for Northern Ireland.“I have long known and worked with Mark, and the relationship is a very good one,” he wrote, thanking Mulvaney — who never shook his “acting” title — “for having served the Administration so well.”The long-rumored move makes Meadows, who announced he was not seeking reelection for his House seat from North Carolina, effectively Trump’s fourth chief of staff since taking office in 2017.The decision comes as the Trump administration has faced criticism for its handling of the novel coronavirus outbreak. Mulvaney had been leading the interagency response to the virus until Trump designated Vice President Mike Pence to lead the whole-of-government effort more than a week ago.Mulvaney has been marginalized inside the White House for months, taking on a more and more narrow role. And Trump has been eyeing the change for months, but wanted to wait until after impeachment, according to a person familiar with his thinking who spoke on condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to discuss it publicly.Mulvaney’s allies, however, had long brushed off rumblings off his imminent departure and had said as recently as last month that he planned to stay at least through the election in November.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-names-rep-mark-meadows-his-new-chief-of-staff/story-cb6LeTRKIcgDMarj3rH7HN.html
07-03-2020||World||‘It’s pandemonium’: Panic-buying hits Los Angeles amid coronavirus outbreak fears||Sprinting shoppers, rationed mineral water and not a roll of toilet paper to be seen: panic-buying sparked by the new coronavirus soared in Los Angeles this week.Two days after California declared a statewide emergency, wholesale stores visited by AFP on Friday were unable to keep up with soaring demand for a range of staple items, as citizens prepare for the worst.“It’s pandemonium -- our numbers are double the usual,” said Rene, an employee at a Costco supermarket in Burbank.“Today has been out of control. That’s why we’re out of toilet paper, out of almost all water, out of hand sanitizer.”One person has died so far in California, which as of Friday had registered 69 coronavirus cases -- second in the US only to nearby Washington state.Despite officials’ pleas for restraint, Californians have begun emulating the panic-buying seen across swathes of Asia and other regions.“It’s been nuts,” Costco CFO Richard Galanti told analysts on a call Thursday.The same day, police in San Bernardino County, near Los Angeles, were called to one store after customers became enraged by the lack of supplies.On Friday, Costco shoppers were restricted to two crates of water, down from four the previous day.Several tried to ignore the rule and saw their extra waters confiscated at checkout, leading to “some pushing, a little bit,” an attendant said.A worker wheeling an overloaded cart of confiscated bottles back to their shelf was repeatedly stopped by new customers grabbing what they could.Even Costco’s famous free food samples had been suspended for fear of spreading the virus, another employee confirmed.“With the madness here, it’s starting to really set in,” said Lisa Garcia, a 30-year-old retail worker who admitted she was growing seriously worried.“We were thinking of stocking up on paper products, but look at those empty shelves!” she told AFP.At another nearby branch, employees reported shoppers dashing at full pace through the doors as the store opened, desperate to grab supplies.By midday, only expensive sparkling Perrier bottles remained, to the disappointment of several shoppers.But some shoppers, though concerned, managed to see the lighter side of the situation.“I’m guarded,” said emergency responder Andrew, who did not want to give his last name, wheeling a trolley filled with water, paper towels, limes and ginger ale.“I want to make sure we have the essentials -- some mixers, some wines, you know, so if things go bad I can make a drink.”“I’m here just in case the apocalypse is going to happen,” joked Carlos Gonzalez, a 35-year-old student.“I guess they’ve found a good way to sell a lot of stuff.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/it-s-pandemonium-panic-buying-hits-los-angeles-amid-coronavirus-outbreak-fears/story-qwdPd56AC9wZSslgCSST2O.html
07-03-2020||World||Coronavirus: 21 people test Covid-19 positive on cruise ship off California||Twenty-one people aboard a mammoth cruise ship off the California coast tested positive for the new coronavirus and 19 of them are crew members, Vice President Mike Pence announced Friday, amid evidence the vessel was the breeding ground for a deadly cluster of more than 10 cases during its previous voyage.He said federal officials were working with California authorities on a plan to bring the ship to a non-commercial port. There was no immediate word on where or when the vessel will dock, and in the meantime, everyone on aboard was keeping to themselves in their rooms.“All passengers and crew will be tested for the virus,” Pence said. “Those that will need to be quarantined will be quarantined. Those who will require medical help will receive it.” Follow coronavirus latest updates here Pence said 46 of the more than 3,500 people aboard were tested in the first round. A military helicopter crew lowered test kits onto the 951-foot (290-meter) Grand Princess by rope Thursday and later retrieved them for analysis as the vessel waited off San Francisco, under orders to keep its distance from shore.Health officials trying to establish whether the virus is circulating on the Grand Princess undertook the testing after reporting that a passenger on a previous voyage of the ship, in February, died of the disease.In the past few days, health authorities disclosed that at least 10 other people who were on the same journey also were found to be infected. And some passengers on that trip stayed aboard for the current voyage — increasing crew members’ exposure to the virus.“We know the coronavirus manifested among the previous passengers ... we will be testing everyone on the ship, we will be quarantining as necessary,” Pence said. “We anticipate that they will be quarantined on the ship, they will not need to disembark.”Princess Cruises said the ship’s doctor would inform passengers and crew of their results after confirmation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Another Princess ship, the Diamond Princess, was quarantined for two weeks in Yokohama, Japan, last month because of the virus, and ultimately about 700 of the 3,700 people aboard became infected in what experts pronounced a public-health failure, with the vessel essentially becoming a floating germ factory.Meanwhile, the US death toll from the coronavirus climbed to 14, with all but one victim in Washington state, while the number of infections swelled to over 200, scattered across about half the states. Pennsylvania, Indiana, Minnesota and Nebraska reported their first cases.Also read: Swab samples of 300 Indians in coronavirus hit- Iran to arrive todayOn Wall Street, stocks swung wildly as fears mounted over the potential damage to the global economy from factory shutdowns, travel bans, quarantines and cancellations of events big and small — a list that grew to include the world-famous South by Southwest arts festival in Austin, Texas, which was set to begin next week.President Donald Trump signed an $8.3 billion measure to help public health agencies deal with crisis and spur development of vaccines and treatments.Worldwide, the virus has infected more than 100,000 people and killed over 3,400, the vast majority of them in China. Most cases have been mild, and more than half of those infected have recovered.Most of the dead in the US were from suburban Seattle’s Life Care Center nursing home, now the subject of federal and state investigations that could lead to sanctions, including a possible takeover of its management. Washington state has the nation’s biggest concentration of cases, with at least 70.Thirty medical professionals from the US Public Health Service will arrive Saturday at the nursing home to help care for patients and provide relief to the exhausted staff, said Dow Constantine, executive in charge of Seattle’s King County.Also read: Army to establish quarantine centres for 1,500 people as coronavirus spreads“We are grateful the cavalry is arriving. It will make rapid change in the conditions there,” he said.The nursing home was down to 69 residents after 15 were taken to the hospital in the preceding 24 hours, Constantine said.Some major businesses in the Seattle area — including Microsoft and Amazon, which together employ more than 100,000 people in the region — have shut down operations or urged employees to work from home. The University of Washington called off classes at its three Seattle-area campuses for the next two weeks and will instead teach its 57,000 students online. And a comics convention next week in Seattle that was expected to draw about 100,000 people was cancelled.In California, the ship was returning to San Francisco after visiting Hawaii.A Sacramento-area man who sailed aboard the Grand Princess last month during a visit to a series of Mexican ports later succumbed to the virus, California authorities said. Others who were on that voyage also have tested positive in Northern California, Nevada, and Canada.Three dozen passengers on the Grand Princess have had flu-like symptoms over the past two weeks or so, said Mary Ellen Carroll, executive director of San Francisco’s Department of Emergency Management.An epidemiologist who studies the spread of virus particles said the recirculated air from a cruise ship’s ventilation system, plus the close quarters and communal settings, make passengers and crew vulnerable to infectious diseases.“They’re not designed as quarantine facilities, to put it mildly,” said Don Milton of the University of Maryland. “You’re going to amplify the infection by keeping people on the boat.”He said the fallout from the ship quarantined in Japan demonstrates the urgent need to move people off the ship and into a “safer quarantine environment.”Steven Smith and his wife, Michele, of Paradise, California, said they are a bit worried but feel safe in their room aboard the Grand Princess.“What’s given us hope is that the system that is in place, our government, the CDC, we feel is doing a remarkable job,” Steven Smith said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-21-positive-for-coronavirus-on-cruise-ship-off-california/story-bS2FvJwSLEiuWffB8OxTnK.html
07-03-2020||World||Trump’s CDC visit raises concerns on US’ ability to tackle coronavirus outbreak||President Donald Trump’s visit to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday turned into a scattershot defense of his administration’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak, veering into political score-settling, exaggerations and talk harking back to his impeachment.With financial markets slowing and the virus spreading, Trump tried once more to quell the growing alarm that has prompted travel to be curtailed and events to be cancelled from coast to coast. But Trump, wearing his “Keep America Great” campaign hat while discussing the global worry, repeatedly detoured from his message of reassurance.Trump called Washington state’s governor, who is dealing with the most serious outbreak in the nation, a “snake.” He said he’d prefer that people exposed to the virus on a cruise ship be left aboard so they wouldn’t be added to the count for the nation’s total number of infections. And he falsely claimed that a test for the virus was available immediately to all who want it.He also suggested the accuracy of the coronavirus test was “perfect — like the letter was perfect.” With that, Trump was making a comparison to the July phone call with Ukraine’s president that led to his impeachment. Trump, who was acquitted by the Senate last month, has insisted he did nothing wrong.Before departing Washington, Trump signed an $8.3 billion coronavirus response funding bill at the White House and instructed the public: “Be calm. It will go away.”“We have very low numbers compared to major countries throughout the world. Our numbers are lower than just about anybody,” Trump said about cases of the virus.But his messaging was more scattered at the CDC, reflective of the on-again, off-again, on-again nature of the trip itself. The White House had announced early Friday that Trump’s trip to the CDC was canceled because of concern about a possible infection there, but that person tested negative and Trump ended up going after all.During his visit to the CDC, Trump touted the ratings of his town hall this week on Fox News and mocked a CNN reporter. He cut off Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar as he tried to counsel Americans to be patient. And despite calling this week for bipartisanship during the crisis, Trump said he told Vice President Mike Pence not to be complimentary during his Thursday meeting with Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington because “he is a snake.”“So I told Mike not to be complimentary of the governor because that governor is a snake, OK? Inslee. I said, ‘If you’re nice to him he will take advantage.’ And I would have said no. Let me just tell you: We have a lot of problems with the governor, the governor of Washington. ... So Mike may be happy with him but I’m not.”Trump also insisted that for those concerned about the virus, “Anybody who wants a test, can get a test.”Pence, who chairs the federal coronavirus task force, at a later briefing suggested a timeline of “weeks” before the test would be widely available to the general public.Pence was also asked whether Trump’s comments about Inslee and impeachment raised questions about how seriously the president was taking the virus. The vice president responded, “I promise you, President Trump has no higher priority than the health and safety of the American people.”Inslee tweeted his own response to Trump’s comments: ”It’s important for leaders to speak with one voice. I just wish the president and vice president could get on the same page.”Trump also said he talked on the phone with California Gov. Gavin Newsom about the 3,500 people stuck on a cruise ship anchored off the coast of California. He said he’d prefer for the passengers to remain on the ship — in part so they would not count against the total number of victims in the United States.“I don’t need to have the numbers double because of the people on that ship,” he said. Trump did say he would defer to the medical experts and Pence later said the ship would be brought to a U.S. port.The legislation Trump signed at the White House provides federal public health agencies with money for vaccines, tests and potential treatments and helps state and local governments prepare and respond to the threat.“It’s an unforeseen problem,” Trump said of the virus. “It came out of nowhere. We’re taking care of it.”The president, while touring the CDC, talked up his ability to understand the virus, although he has repeatedly misstated how long it would take for a vaccine to be developed and available.“I like this stuff.

07-03-2020||World||Three Saudi Arabia princes detained, accused of treason: Report||Saudi authorities have detained three royal family members including two senior princes, the US media reported Friday, signalling the powerful crown prince is further tightening his grip on power.Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz al-Saud, a brother of King Salman, and the monarch’s nephew Prince Mohammed bin Nayef were taken from their homes early Friday by royal guards after being accused of treason, the Wall Street Journal reported citing unnamed sources.The New York Times also reported the detentions, adding that Prince Nayef’s younger brother Prince Nawaf bin Nayef had also been detained.Saudi authorities did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The detentions mark the latest crackdown by de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has consolidated his grip on power with the imprisonment of prominent clerics and activists as well as princes and business elites.Prince Mohammed, the king’s son, has also faced a torrent of international condemnation over the murder of critic Jamal Khashoggi inside the kingdom’s Istanbul consulate in October 2018.Prince Ahmed, said to be in his 70s, had returned to the kingdom from his base in London in the aftermath of the Khashoggi scandal, in what some saw as an effort to shore up support for the monarchy.In June 2017, Prince Mohammed had edged out Prince Nayef, the former crown prince and interior minister, to become heir to the Arab world’s most powerful throne.At the time, Saudi television channels showed Prince Mohammed kissing the hand of the older prince and kneeling before him in a show of reverence.Western media reports later said that the deposed prince had been placed under house arrest, a claim strongly denied by Saudi authorities.“Prince Mohammed is emboldened -- he has already ousted any threats to his rise and jailed or murdered critics of his regime without any repercussion,” Becca Wasser, a policy analyst at the US-based RAND Corporation, said of the latest crackdown.“This is a further step to shore up his power and a message to anyone -- including royals -- not to cross him.” The detentions come at a sensitive time as Saudi Arabia bars Muslim pilgrims from Islam’s holiest sites to contain the novel coronavirus.The kingdom has suspended the “umrah” year-round pilgrimage over fears of the disease spreading to Mecca and Medina, raising uncertainty over the upcoming hajj -- a key pillar of Islam.The oil-rich kingdom is also grappling with plunging price of crude, its major source of revenue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/three-saudi-arabia-princes-detained-accused-of-treason-report/story-ZJgobMDPzWauPqdnrBa8MK.html
