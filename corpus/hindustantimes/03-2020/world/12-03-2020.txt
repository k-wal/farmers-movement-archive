Zhao, spokesperson and deputy director general of the information department of the foreign ministry, tweeted: “CDC was caught on the spot. When did patient zero begin in US? How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals? It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation!In an earlier tweet, Zhao referred to Redfield’s statement made during a meeting in Washington.Zhao didn’t elaborate on his allegation.Earlier in the day, the Chinese foreign ministry reacted sharply when asked to respond to the allegation made by Robert O’Brien, the White House national security adviser, that China covered up the virus outbreak in Wuhan, and this likely cost the world two months of time to prepare.“The US official accuses China of ‘covering up’ the disease. Well, the world knows better that China released information in an open and transparent manner. It identified the pathogen within a record short period of time and shared the genetic sequence of the virus with WHO and other countries including the US,” spokesperson, Geng Shuang said at the regular ministry briefing.“Not long ago, China hosted a WHO mission including US experts for a nine-day visit, after which they highly commended China’s transparency. Here we do not comment on whether the US response is open and transparent, but obviously, someone in the US still turns a deaf ear to international appraisal on China,” he added.Geng said: “To quote an ancient Chinese saying, “Turn inward and examine yourself when you encounter difficulties in life.” We urge the US official to respect facts and the common understanding of the international community.”Meanwhile, the prestigious medical journal, The Lancet has published a study detailing the first known person-to-person transmission of the novel coronavirus in the US.“On January 23, 2020, Illinois reported the state’s first laboratory-confirmed case (index case) of covid-19 in a woman in her 60s, who returned from Wuhan, China in mid-January, 2020. Subsequently, the first evidence of secondary transmission in the USA was reported on January 30, when her husband, who had not travelled outside the USA but had frequent, close contact with his wife since her return, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2,” the study said.On December 25, according to the study, the female patient travelled to Wuhan where she visited a hospitalised-relative and other family members with undiagnosed respiratory illness.“On her return to the USA on January 13, 2020, she experienced six days of mild fever, fatigue, and cough before being hospitalised with pneumonia and testing positive for SARS-CoV-2,” the study said.The couple has since recovered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/might-be-us-army-who-brought-epidemic-to-wuhan-chinese-fm-spokesperson/story-0cBt4K7LYQhXSjUP8o7PqN.html
12-03-2020||World||UK’s ‘cruel tax’: Indian doctors, nurses to pay more for own treatment||Faced with tens of thousands of vacancies in National Health Service (NHS), Britain’s healthcare leaders on Thursday described as a “cruel tax” the rise announced by the Boris Johnson government in the ‘immigration health surcharge’ levied on Indian and other non-EU health professionals, from £400 to £624.The rise, announced in the Conservative manifesto for the December 2019 election, was confirmed by chancellor Rishi Sunak during his budget speech on Wednesday. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) is among stake-holders calling for the surcharge to be scrapped.The annual surcharge, to be paid at the time of applying for UK visa by anyone coming for more than six months, is levied on the main applicant as well as on each dependent, raising the overall visa cost since it was introduced in 2015. It is not levied when the immigrant qualifies for permanent stay, usually after five years.Donna Kinnair, RCN’s chief executive, said: “Nurses from overseas already pay for the NHS through their taxes and there can be no justification to increase this cruel tax to more than £600”.“Nurses don’t just have to pay for themselves, but for any dependent children they have as well. At a time when there are more than 40,000 nursing vacancies, and difficulties in recruitment, the government must exempt nurses from this heartless charge,” she added.Sunak said in his budget speech: “Migrants benefit from our NHS. And we all want them to do so – but it’s right that what people get out, they also put in. There is a surcharge already, but it doesn’t properly reflect the benefits people receive”.“So, as we promised in our manifesto, we are increasing the Immigration Health Surcharge to £624, with a discounted rate for children”.Ramesh Mehta, president of the British Association for Physicians of Indian Origin (Bapio), added: “This rise is extremely unfortunate. It does not make sense: people already paying taxes are asked to pay such a significant amount, while they themselves are providing much needed medical services”.“This will put off qualified health professionals from coming to the UK”, he said.Doctors who qualified in India constitute the largest group in the NHS, after UK-trained doctors. A large number of Indian nurses are also employed in the NHS, which continues to hold recruitment drives in India to fill large number of vacancies.Usha Parashar of Ficci-UK, added: “The increase in the health surcharge to £624 will add to the already expensive visa fees for overseas skilled workers. This will be an additional burden on Indian businesses operating in the UK”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-s-cruel-tax-indian-doctors-nurses-to-pay-more-for-own-treatment/story-Odrt6P04wtXmdqCcXZDSOI.html

Her symptoms have since subsided.“Out of an abundance of caution, the Prime Minister is opting to self-isolate and work from home until receiving Sophie’s results,” the statement said.His office said the doctor’s advice to the prime minister is to continue daily activities while self-monitoring, given that he is exhibiting no symptoms himself. He is spending the day in briefings, phone calls, and virtual meetings from home, including speaking with other world leaders and joining a special cabinet committee discussion on the new coronavirus.Trudeau has also cancelled an in-person meeting with Canada’s provincial premiers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-scare-canadian-pm-justin-trudeau-stays-at-home-after-wife-s-flu-like-symptoms/story-wOhSFMRn1xiTH3MDUtsMnI.html

Bolsonaro’s communications aide Fabio Wajngarten, who also met Trump at Mar-a-Lago, tested positive for the virus, his communications office said in a statement.“Let’s put it this way: I’m not concerned,” Trump told reporters while meeting with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar in the Oval Office.He said he had heard about the aide’s exposure but that “we did nothing very unusual.”Trump also said he and Varadkar opted not to shake hands when the Irish leader arrived at the White House for the traditional St. Patrick’s Day meeting.“It’s a very strange feeling,” Trump said of not shaking hands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-not-concerned-he-was-exposed-to-coronavirus-by-brazilian-official/story-uKvcu4U2aItRulzXTwhwnJ.html
12-03-2020||World||Skull of smallest-known bird embedded in 99-million-year-old amber||Scientists are marveling over the exquisitely preserved skull of what appears to be the smallest-known bird - tinier than any hummingbird - encased in 99-million-year-old amber and boasting many odd traits including jaws studded with numerous puny teeth.The skull, measuring about half an inch (14.25 mm) long, belongs to a bird called Oculudentavis khaungraae that lived during the Cretaceous Period in what is now northern Myanmar, the researchers said on Wednesday. None of the rest of the body was preserved, but the researchers estimated that Oculudentavis weighed about an ounce (28 grams) and measured 2 inches (5 cm) long including a hypothetical bony tail.“I was totally blown away,” said paleontologist Jingmai O’Connor of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing, describing her reaction upon seeing the fossil. “It’s probably the most beautifully preserved Mesozoic bird skull I’ve ever seen, and it’s so weird.”The Mesozoic Era was the age of the dinosaurs.“I was amazed,” added Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County paleontologist and study co-author Luis Chiappe.O’Connor said Oculudentavis appeared to be smaller than a bee hummingbird, until now considered the world’s littlest bird.Oculudentavis shares few similarities, aside from size, with hummingbirds, which like all modern birds lack teeth and eat nectar. Many Mesozoic birds had teeth, but Oculudentavis possessed the most - about 100, with a conical shape and sharp ridges on the edges. Oculudentavis likely hunted insects. Hummingbirds have long beaks, unlike Oculudentavis.Birds evolved from small feathered dinosaurs roughly 150 million years ago. Oculudentavis illustrates the almost-incomprehensible size difference among members of the dinosaur lineage, contrasting to contemporaneous South American long-necked, pillar-legged dinosaur Argentinosaurus at perhaps 90 tons and 115 feet (35 meters).“The size diversity hints at the amazing biology of dinosaurs, capable of sustaining such a diversity of forms,” said O’Connor, who led the research published in the journal Nature.Its eyes resembled those of owls, with the eye bones forming a cone, indicating acute vision, O’Connor said. Unlike birds of prey with forward-facing eyes and binocular vision enabling good depth perception, the eyes in Oculudentavis faced to the sides and bulged out of its head. The small size of the aperture of the eye bones indicates Oculudentavis was active during daytime.Amber - fossilized tree sap - has preserved numerous small organisms including insects, lizards and frogs.“Amber is just amazing as a preservational medium,” O’Connor said. “If the animal does not decay much before getting entombed in resin, the preservation is phenomenal: All the soft tissues preserved in three dimensions, like a window into an ancient world.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/skull-of-smallest-known-bird-embedded-in-99-million-year-old-amber/story-qdmqOg5dQ86fAMA55JNanK.html
12-03-2020||World||Scientists in Israel likely to announce they developed coronavirus vaccine: Report||Scientists in Israel are expected to announce in the coming days that they have completed development of a vaccine for the new coronavirus COVID-19, according to a media report here. Israeli daily Ha’aretz, quoting medical sources, reported on Thursday that scientists at the Israel’s Institute for Biological Research, supervised by the Prime Minister’s office, have recently had a significant breakthrough in understanding the biological mechanism and qualities of the virus, including better diagnostic capability, production of antibodies for those who already have the virus and development of a vaccine. The development process, however, requires a series of tests and experiments that may last many months before the vaccination is deemed effective or safe to use, the report said. The Defence Ministry, however, did not confirm the same in its response to the daily.“There has been no breakthrough in the efforts of the biological institute to find a vaccine for the coronavirus or to develop testing kits. The institute’s work is conducted according to an orderly work plan and it will take time. If and when there will be something to report, it will be done in an orderly fashion”, the Defence Ministry told Ha’aretz.“The biological institute is a world-renowned research and development agency, which relies on experienced researchers and scientists with great knowledge and quality infrastructures. There are now more than 50 experienced scientists working at the institute on researching and developing a medical remedy for the virus,” it added. The Institute for Biological Research, located in the central Israeli town of Nes Tziona, was established in 1952 as part of the Israel Defence Forces’ Science Corps, and later became a civilian organisation. It is technically under the supervision of the Prime Minister’s Office, but is in close communication with the Defence Ministry, as per the report. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is said to have ordered the institute to devote resources to develop a vaccine for Covid-19 on February 1.The normal process of development of such a vaccine requires a long process of pre-clinical trials on animals, followed by clinical trials. This period allows for a full characterization of side effects and a better understanding of how different populations are affected, the daily said. The global emergency over the coronavirus pandemic however may accelerate this process in order to vaccinate as many people who are most at risk from the virus, it said. Israel’s most popular news portal, Ynet, reported about three weeks ago that five shipments of virus samples arrived here from Japan, Italy and other countries. They were brought by a specially secured Defence Ministry courier to the Institute for Biological Research and had been frozen at -80 degrees Celsius, it said. There has been intensive work, including by leading experts, to develop the vaccine since then. Experts believe that the length of time needed to develop a vaccine runs from a few months to a year and a half. Numerous research teams all over the world are participating in the race to develop a vaccine for COVID-19. Many of them at this point are focusing on the way the virus presents itself in animals, with the biggest hurdle being the way it morphs when it moves from animals to human beings. China released the genetic sequence of the virus on open scientific databases shortly after its outbreak in January so that research institutes and commercial companies could try to develop treatments and vaccines without requiring to obtain samples. Around a month and a half after the genetic sequence was published, biotechnology company Moderna, Inc., based in Boston, Massachussets, announced it had completed the development of a possible coronavirus vaccine, Ha’aretz reported.The vaccine was sent to the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, with clinical trials, which will include up to 25 health participants to start in April, the report said.Any vaccine developed in Israel will presumably also need to go through a similar or even stricter process before it will be approved for use, the daily said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scientists-in-israel-likely-to-announce-they-developed-coronavirus-vaccine-report/story-QxGMJZVkzfEhhcFJEyEehP.html
12-03-2020||World||Ireland orders shutdowns to curb coronavirus||Ireland on Thursday announced the closure of all schools and colleges, and recommended the cancellation of mass gatherings as part of measures to combat the spread of the coronavirus.Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said “schools, colleges and childcare facilities will close from tomorrow (Friday)”, as would state-run cultural institutions.Indoor events of more than 100 people and those outdoor involving over 500 “should be cancelled”, Varadkar said in a statement in Washington, where he was on an official visit.Ireland has 43 confirmed cases of the disease and on Wednesday announced the country’s first death. Varadkar said more cases and deaths were expected as the world moved into “uncharted territory”.The premier said the new measures were part of the government’s “duty to protect” the public and the restrictions would be in place until March 29.He said people could still go to work, as public transport was not affected, but recommended home-working, staggered working and break times wherever possible, to minimise contact.The new guidance follows a meeting between the prime minister and the government’s National Public Health Emergency Team on Wednesday night.In Dublin, foreign minister Simon Coveney told a news conference: “This is a phase that we have been planning for some time.”He called them “the right measures, at the right time” and were based on best public health advice.Varadkar travelled to Washington for St Patrick’s Day celebrations on March 17 for Ireland’s patron saint.The annual parades in Ireland, which attract hundreds of thousands of people, have been cancelled because of fears about the spread of COVID-19.Similar parades in Boston and New York have also been cancelled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ireland-orders-shutdowns-to-curb-coronavirus/story-MpH0uarJwi1DPVy4jlMjvN.html

He said made the request last week in a letter to IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva. The international lender has said it stands ready to support countries through a Rapid Financial Instrument.Iran’s economy has been battered by U.S. sanctions, which have choked Tehran’s ability to sell its oil. The recent outbreak of the virus there has compounded its economic woes, with all of Iran’s neighbors closing their borders to Iranians and multiple nations cutting travel links with Iran, including shipping in some cases, which is affecting imports, as well.For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus and the COVID-19 illness it causes.Because there is still no vaccine for the infectious disease, countries are implementing tough measures to restrict its spread, as well as the impact an outbreak could have on emergency rooms and intensive care units.A spike in cases in the Gulf Arab states helped push infections in the Middle East for the new coronavirus past 10,000 cases on Thursday, with most infected people either in Iran or having recently traveled there.Countries in the region have imposed their own varying levels of travel restrictions, from wholesale halting of all commercial flights in Kuwait, to Saudi Arabia banning travel to 39 countries.Regional stock markets were also down, reflecting investor concerns and nerves felt globally as oil prices plunge and tourism revenue is eroded by the virus. The World Health Organization on Wednesday officially designated the outbreak a “pandemic.”Multiple top officials in Iran — from its senior vice president to Cabinet ministers, members of parliament, Revolutionary Guard members, health workers and health ministry officials — have contracted the virus. Some of those officials have died.There are concerns that the number of infections across Iran is much higher than the confirmed cases reported by the government, which is struggling to contain or manage its spread. The rising casualty figures each day in Iran suggest the fight against the new coronavirus is far from over.A third Lebanese man died from the coronavirus, state-run National News Agency said Thursday. It said the man’s immune system was impaired because he had cancer. Local media reported the man was 79 years old and that the virus was transmitted to him from the first man who had died in Lebanon earlier this week.Outside of Iran, only Iraq, Egypt and Lebanon have recorded deaths from the virus in the Middle East. Iran has one of the world’s worst death tolls outside of China, the epicenter of the outbreak.This week, Qatar reported a massive jump in cases of the new coronavirus late Wednesday with 262 now infected. The more than 200 new cases had been found in quarantine. In the Gulf Arab island nation of Bahrain, confirmed cases also rose by nearly 70% this week to 189 confirmed cases, after some 77 new cases were confirmed on a returning flight of Bahrainis from Iran.Kuwait on Thursday closed all workplaces and non-essential business for two weeks, including restaurants, cafes and health clubs. Schools and universities have already been suspended. All commercial flights are being halted to Kuwait starting Friday. The country has over 70 confirmed cases of the new virus.Egypt, the Arab world’s most populous country, reported seven more cases late Wednesday, bringing the country’s total number of cases to 67. In the southern tourist-driven city of Luxor, 70 Egyptian workers and guides remained in quarantine on a Nile cruise ship called the Asara. Earlier this week, 83 foreign tourists left quarantine on the ship and flew home week after testing negative for the virus.Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, announced a jump in cases from 21 to 45 late Wednesday, among them 12 Egyptians under quarantine in Mecca. The government has suspended pilgrimage to Islam’s holiest sites, barring entry of all pilgrims to Mecca and Medina to curb the virus’ spread. It has also cordoned off the eastern province of Qatif, where more than a dozen cases are confirmed among its mostly Shiite population from people who recently visited Iran.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-asks-imf-for-5-billion-loan-to-fight-coronavirus/story-y47ZZPJ7zzODgMglusKsbK.html

12-03-2020||World||Coronavirus is a ‘controllable pandemic’: WHO||The new coronavirus outbreak “is a controllable pandemic” if countries step up measures to tackle it, the head of the World Health Organization said Thursday.WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus acknowledged Wednesday that the global outbreak of the new coronavirus could now be considered a pandemic -- a disease actively spreading globally.But he told diplomats in Geneva that describing the outbreak as a pandemic should not mean that countries give up the fight to stop it spreading further.“This is a controllable pandemic,” he said, according to a statement of his remarks.“We are deeply concerned that some countries are not approaching this threat with the level of political commitment needed to control it.“The idea that countries should shift from containment to mitigation is wrong and dangerous,” he stressed.More than 4,500 people have died, according to an AFP tally, while the WHO said some 125,000 cases had been reported from 118 countries and territories.“To save lives we must reduce transmission,” Tedros insisted.“That means finding and isolating as many cases as possible and quarantining their closest contacts,” he said, urging states to test every suspected case of COVID-19 in a bid to slow transmission.“Even if you cannot stop transmission, you can slow it down and protect health facilities, old age homes and other vital areas -- but only if you test all suspected cases.”The majority of cases have been in China, where the outbreak emerged in December, but major hotspots have also emerged in South Korea, Iran and Italy.Together, those four countries account for more than 90 percent of all reported cases, according to the WHO.- ‘Robust surveillance’ -The pandemic has disrupted cultural and sporting events around the world as authorities try to prevent large gatherings.Tedros said countries needed to find the right balance between protecting health and preventing social and economic disruption.However, “containment” needed to remain the central pillar in any plan to tackle the spread, he said.“You can’t fight a virus if you don’t know where it is. That means robust surveillance to find, isolate, test and treat every case, to break the chains of transmission.”Tedros urged unaffected countries to prepare their health facilities, and pressed all states to innovate and share any new ways to prevent infections and minimise the impact of the outbreak.More than $440 million (390 million euros) has been pledged towards the WHO’s strategic preparedness and response plan, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-is-a-controllable-pandemic-who/story-QXDjunJNzu7OKAm81m8YHO.html
12-03-2020||World||China shuts down Mount Everest over coronavirus||China has cancelled permits for Mount Everest because of the coronavirus, expedition organisers said Thursday, ahead of the spring climbing season on the world’s highest peak.Last year’s traffic-clogged spring window saw a record 885 people summit Everest, 644 of them from Nepal and 241 from the northern flank in Tibet.The Nepal side remains open for now although some expedition operators have seen cancellations and climbers have been asked to submit a 14-day travel history and medical reports. The Chinese authorities “have informed us that the mountain will close from the north side,” Lukas Furtenbach of Austria-based Furtenbach Adventures told AFP.Furtenbach said that he will be shifting his 11 clients to Nepal.Tourist areas in Tibet have been closed since January, according to the local tourism office.The China Tibet Mountaineering Association, which issues permits for Everest, declined to comment when contacted by AFP.Another company, Alpenglow Expeditions, has cancelled its Everest plans.“I am in agreement with China’s decision. It is responsible... Climbing a mountain is not currently worth the transmission risk in the Base Camps, nor upon returning home,” Adrian Ballinger of Alpenglow Expeditions said in a statement Wednesday.Some companies in Nepal have also seen cancellations.“We had bookings from 23 climbers, but two groups have already cancelled. We might have just 8 to 10 climbers this year,” said Pasang Tenje Sherpa of Pioneer Adventure. A Nepali team, specialised in fixing the climbing route, is currently on its way to the base camp to begin fixing ropes on Everest.Everest attracts hundreds of mountaineers from all over the world each spring, when a window of good weather opens up between late April and the end of May, prompting a rush for the summit.Nepal has so far seen only one confirmed case of the coronavirus.It has suspended visas on arrival for visitors from eight countries badly hit, meaning they have to apply beforehand and submit a health certificate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-shuts-down-mount-everest-over-coronavirus/story-ERrBPz2z0QoKf1AGNCRt7K.html
12-03-2020||World||China says its coronavirus peak is over, new cases see a decline||Chinese news agency Xinhua on Thursday reported that the peak of the novel coronavirus outbreak in the country is over. Xinhua quoted a spokesperson of the National Health Commission. In a press conference in Beijing, Mi Feng said that new cases of coronavirus in the nation are on a decline. Feng added that the overall epidemic situation in the country remains at a low level. The report also added that new cases of coronavirus in Wuhan have dropped to a single digit. Only eight cases were reported from the region on Wednesday, whereas Chinese mainland outside Hubei reported seven new cases, six of them were imported from abroad.Watch | Coronavirus scare in India: Government suspends all visas as cases mountHubei province, where the coronavirus emerged late last year in December, announced on Thursday a further loosening of travel restrictions and will also allow some industries to resume production in two of its cities and two counties.While the virus is spreading quickly globally, its progress in China has slowed markedly in the past seven days, a result of strict measures imposed to control the movement of people and traffic, including the virtual lockdown of Wuhan, a city of 11 million people.In all, 15 new coronavirus cases were recorded in mainland China on Wednesday, down from 24 the day before.The total number of cases recorded in mainland China stands at 80,793. As of Tuesday, 62,793 people had recovered - nearly 80 per cent of the infections.As of the end of Wednesday, the death toll in mainland China had reached 3,169, up by 11 from the previous day.

12-03-2020||World||640 light-years from Earth is an ‘ultra-hot giant planet’ where it ‘rains’ iron||Astronomers have observed an ultra-hot giant planet in the constellation of Pisces where they suspect it rains iron, a finding that may lead to better ways of studying the climate of the most extreme planets outside the Solar System.According to the researchers, including those from the University of Geneva in Switzerland, the giant exoplanet WASP-76b is at a distance that would take even light 640 years to reach the Earth, and has a day side where temperatures climb above 2400 degrees Celsius -- high enough to vaporise metals. The study, published in the journal Nature, noted that strong winds carry iron vapour to the cooler night side where it may be condensing into iron droplets.“One could say that this planet gets rainy in the evening, except it rains iron,” said study co-author David Ehrenreich, a professor at the University of Geneva in Switzerland.The researchers said this phenomenon happens because the ‘iron rain’ planet only ever shows one face -- its day side -- to its parent star, while its cooler night side remains in perpetual darkness. They explained that like the Earth’s Moon, WASP-76b is ‘tidally locked’, meaning it takes as long to rotate around its axis as it does to go around the star.Also read: NASA releases photo of mysterious hole on Mars that could hold clue to life on Red PlanetOn its day side, the study noted, it receives thousands of times more radiation from its parent star than the Earth does from the Sun. The planet is also so close to its star it takes just 43 hours to complete one revolution, the researchers reported in the study.According to the scientists, this side is so hot that molecules separate into atoms, and metals like iron evaporate into the atmosphere. This extreme temperature difference between the day and night sides results in vigorous winds that bring the iron vapour from the ultra-hot day side to the cooler night side, where temperatures decrease to around 1500 degrees Celsius, the study noted.The planet also has distinct day-night chemistry, according to the scientists. While they detected the trace of iron vapour at the division between the daytime and the night-time sector of the planet, they did not see any traces of the element in the exoplanet’s dark side, the study noted.“No signal arises from the nightside close to the morning terminator, showing that atomic iron is not absorbing starlight there. Iron must thus condense during its journey across the nightside,” the scientists noted in the study, marking the first time chemical variations have been detected in a giant ultra-hot planet. “However, suprisingly we do not see this iron vapour at dawn. The only explanation possible for this phenomenon is that it rains iron on the dark side of this exoplanet with extreme conditions” Ehrenreich said.The astronomers made this first-of-its-kind discovery using the European Southern Observatory’s (ESO) high resolution spectrograph, ESPRESSO, in the Chilean Atacama Desert.“The observations show that iron vapour is abundant in the atmosphere of the hot day side of WASP-76b,” said María Rosa Zapatero Osorio, another co-author of the study from the Centre for Astrobiology in Spain.“A fraction of this iron is injected into the night side owing to the planet’s rotation and atmospheric winds. There, the iron encounters much cooler environments, condenses and rains down,” Osorio added.The scientists noted in a statement that ESPRESSO -- the Echelle SPectrograph for Rocky Exoplanets and Stable Spectroscopic Observations -- was originally designed to hunt for Earth-like planets around Sun-like stars. “We soon realised that the remarkable collecting power of the VLT and the extreme stability of ESPRESSO made it a prime machine to study exoplanet atmospheres,” said Pedro Figueira, another study co-author and ESPRESSO instrument scientist at ESO.“What we have now is a whole new way to trace the climate of the most extreme exoplanets,” Ehrenreich said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/640-light-years-from-earth-is-an-ultra-hot-giant-planet-where-it-rains-iron/story-QsCHrN6aDyyORm8PfSs92I.html

And we all want them to do so – but it’s right that what people get out, they also put in,” the 39-year-old Chancellor of the Exchequer said in his Budget statement in the House of Commons on Wednesday.“There is a surcharge already, but it doesn’t properly reflect the benefits people receive. So, as we promised in our manifesto, we are increasing the Immigration Health Surcharge to 624 pounds, with a discounted rate for children,” he said.The hike was expected as it was in the December 2019 General Election manifesto of the Boris Johnson-led government, but its timing is now confirmed as this year. A new discounted rate of 470 pounds has been incorporated for children aged under 18, but the lower rate for international students is also set for a rise -- from 300 pounds to 470 pounds.The IHS was introduced in April 2015 and from December 2018 it was hiked from 200 pounds to 400 pounds per year. It is imposed on anyone in the UK on a work, study or family visa for longer than six months in order to raise additional funds for the country’s state-funded NHS.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (BAPIO), the UK’s largest representative body for Indian-origin doctors, has been lobbying the UK Home Office for a rethink over the charge as it would have an adverse impact on their attempt to recruit more healthcare professionals from India to meet staff shortages in the NHS.Indian industry warned that the further hike would mean an added burden on already high visa fees.“The increase in the health surcharge to 620 pounds will add to the already expensive visa fees for overseas skilled workers. This will be an additional burden on Indian businesses operating in the UK,” said Baroness Usha Prashar, Chair of the UK Council of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI).FICCI described the overall Budget as a “balanced and pragmatic” one against the backdrop of the global outbreak of COVID-19.“Increased investment in R&D (Research and Development) to 22 billion pounds a year and the announcement of 130 million pounds of new funding to extend Startup Loans will give a major boost to innovation and entrepreneurship,” Prashar said.Referring to the Bank of England’s decision to cut interest rates, Loknath Mishra, Chair of the Financial Services Committee of FICCI’s UK Council and MD and CEO of ICICI Bank UK Plc, said it was a “timely and proportionate response” to the current crisis posed by the coronavirus crisis. “This announcement will support businesses in these turbulent times to manage their credit flows and better manage their cash flows,” he said. The Bank of England cut its key interest rate by 0.5 per cent to 0.25 per cent on Wednesday, as an emergency measure in response to the outbreak of COVID-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-indian-origin-uk-finance-minister-rishi-sunak-s-budget-britain-visas-to-get-costlier/story-Q2TTOXNkrF5yQSJq7NG5YK.html
12-03-2020||World||UN Security Council cuts March schedule over coronavirus||The UN Security Council will scale back its schedule for March as a precaution against the new-coronavirus pandemic, China said on Wednesday.China, which holds the presidency of the Security Council during March and is also the epicentre of the virus, wants to ensure “we will be in a better position to protect ourselves,” said its ambassador, Zhang Jun.While no Security Council sessions will be canceled, China has advised a “scaling down of the meetings” including reducing delegation sizes, Zhang told reporters.Informal consultations within the powerful 15-member body may also be shifted to a larger room so “that we have more space and less people,” he said.The United Nations has pushed back major gatherings outside of the Security Council. On Wednesday it indefinitely delayed a March 23-April 3 meeting on marine biodiversity as well as an April 13-24 forum on indigenous issues.It had already postponed a March annual meeting on the status of women that would have brought 12,000 people to New York.A UN official, speaking anonymously, said the organization should also postpone the five-year review conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), which is scheduled for April 27-May 22.No cases of COVID-19 have been reported within the 3,000-strong UN Secretariat, said the world body’s spokesman, Stephane Dujarric.The United Nations has halted tours and much of the staff have been asked to work remotely, Dujarric said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-security-council-cuts-march-schedule-over-coronavirus/story-EqsFuuv57F0QTDmTBcGc3I.html
12-03-2020||World||Two-thirds of Germans may get coronavirus, says Chancellor Angela Merkel||Germany will spend what it takes to tackle the coronavirus which is likely to infect up to 70% of the population in Europe’s largest economy, Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Wednesday.“We will do what we need to get through this. And then at the end we will look at what that means for our budget,” she told reporters, seeming to distance herself from Germany’s policy of no new borrowing.Though conceding she did not know how the crisis would develop, Merkel said the risk was huge.“When the virus is out there, and the population has no immunity and no vaccination or therapy exists, then a high percentage - experts say 60 to 70% of the population - will be infected, so long as this remains the case,” she said.That drew swift criticism from the Czech prime minister who said Merkel’s remarks could cause panic.Germany has confirmed three deaths related to the coronavirus. It has reported 1,567 cases, according to the Robert Koch Institute for disease control.The first confirmed case among members of the German parliament was also reported on Wednesday. The liberal Free Democrats said one of its lawmakers had contracted the virus and his staff had been quarantined.Merkel addressed the outbreak that the World Health Organisation is now calling a pandemic after mass-selling daily Bild berated her for what it called “the corona chaos”. “No appearances, no speech, no leadership in the crisis,” it wrote.Merkel urged Germans to watch their personal hygiene and contacts, recommending they look each other in the eye “for a second longer” rather than shake hands.“We will do what is necessary as a country, and that is also together with Europe,” added the chancellor, who spoke to fellow European Union (EU) leaders and the president of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Tuesday evening.“We cannot yet gauge the economic consequences... but we will react,” said Merkel, whose government has promised “timely, targeted” stimulus.Post-war federalism in spotlightIn a radio interview, Health Minister Jens Spahn said sealing borders, as neighbour Austria has done to Italians, would not work.At the news conference with Merkel, he urged Germans to stay away from soccer matches, concerts and clubs, but said he was “very reserved” about blanket closures of nurseries and schools as many public service workers rely on them being open.The crisis has drawn attention to Germany’s federal system of government, in which power is devolved to the 16 states and regional authorities. They must decide for themselves whether to follow Spahn’s advice to cancel events with over 1,000 people.Spahn said it was “astonishing” that no decision had been taken to call off a football match between Union Berlin and Bayern Munich scheduled in Berlin on Saturday, though the city later said it would take place behind closed doors.“The corona crisis shows that, without clear guidance, federalism in the fight against epidemics is reaching its limits,” Bild wrote.Merkel said federalism did not mean anyone could evade responsibility, and that she would meet state premiers on Thursday to coordinate the coronavirus response.During Merkel’s news conference, Berlin’s city authorities said they had banned events with more than 1,000 participants until the end of Easter holidays in mid-April.Germany’s federal system was agreed by its victorious enemies after World War Two and enshrined in its constitution to avoid a repeat of the centralised power wielded by the Nazis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-thirds-of-germans-may-get-coronavirus-says-chancellor-angela-merkel/story-09tx9lMyyifU9AwQQtLCGO.html
12-03-2020||World||Coronavirus outbreak: Why no one is talking about the rate of recovery||The number of coronavirus cases across the globe is on the rise. More than 100,000 people have been infected by the virus ever since its outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December last year. Globally, more than 4,000 people have been killed but there’s a flipside to the coronavirus crisis which no one seems to be talking about. The rate of recovery from coronavirus infection is worth looking into. According to China’s National Health Commission, of more than 80,000 confirmed cases in the country over 60,000 have been recovered. This translates into more than 70 per cent recovery rate for the coronavirus patients in China.Now looking at the global picture, the Johns Hopkins University estimates 68,219 coronavirus patients of the total 126,136 global cases to have successfully recovered and discharged - which is over 50 per cent of the those infected across the globe. The university’s ‘coronavirus resource centre’ tracks the latest statistics and shares them as an interactive map compiled by its Center for Systems Science and Engineering. The figures were last updated on March 12.Also read: Visit the clinic or self-isolate? What to do when you suspect coronavirusOn March 9, Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, technical lead of the WHO’s health emergencies programme, said that 80 per cent of coronavirus patients across the globe “will recover”. Also Watch | Coronavirus: What we know and what we don’tLast week, a leading Indian researcher and scientist said that four of five people who have tested positive for coronavirus will get better on their own.

12-03-2020||World||To fight coronavirus, Italy shuts all shops except food stores and pharmacies||Italy on Wednesday shut all stores except for pharmacies and food shops in a desperate bid to halt the spread of a coronavirus that has killed 827 in the country in just over two weeks.Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced the latest wave of restrictions in a dramatic appeal to the nation that came with the country of 60 million battling its biggest crisis in generations.“Thank you to all Italians who make sacrifices. We are proving to be a great nation,” Conte said in his nine-minute evening prime time address to the nation.Italians have watched ever tighter restrictions slowly eat away at the very fabric of everyday life.An existing clampdown on public gathering and basic travel had already emptied streets and shuttered everything from churches to restaurants.AFP photographers spotted masked sanitation workers in white nylon suits and rubber gloves spraying Florence’s deserted Saint Mark’s Square with disinfectant through a long hose.Cathedrals posted hand-written notes cancelling mass and cafes apologised to their regulars for having to turn them away.“I can’t even recognise Rome now,” 30-year-old Muscovite Yekaterina said while posing alone for a photo by the usually bustling Trevi Fountain in the heart of Rome.Conte said the closure of nearly everything that had remained open would run for at least two weeks.How Italians will get by in the meantime is not entirely clear.“All shops will be closed except for basic necessities, such as pharmacies and food stores,” said Conte.“Bars, pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and canteen services will close. Home delivery is allowed.” “No need to rush to buy groceries,” he stressed.Conte’s announcement came hours after his government promised to spend up to 25 billion euros (USD 28 billion) to fight a disease that has put hospitals and the economy under intense strain.The size of Rome’s rescue was the same as one the European Union announced for the entire 27-nation bloc on Monday.Italy’s Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri said half the money would be used immediately and the other half stowed away and tapped should the health crisis spiral out of control.Part of the government’s cash injection is meant to help small businesses that are suffering the brunt of an implosion in the number of tourists who visit Italy’s art-filled churches and achingly beautiful hills.The government also put more meat on the bones of an emerging plan to let families temporarily suspend some mortgage and social tax payments.Gualtieri said “partial state guarantees” were being discussed to help Italy’s creaking banks survive a resulting cash crunch.Italy has witnessed nearly 60 percent of the deaths recorded outside China since the epidemic first started spreading from the Asian giant’s central Hubei province in January.The government responded to the outbreak last month by quarantining 50,000 people in 11 villages that were worst affected in the north.That was followed on Sunday with social distancing measures in Milan’s Lombardy region and surrounding areas in which more than 15 million live and 40 per cent of the nation’s economic activity occurs.The Lombardy measures were extended to all Italy on Tuesday morning.Conte’s announcement on Wednesday ratcheted the restrictions up another notch.The multitude of measures have had a profound and slightly surreal effect on Italian life.The central streets of Rome were deserted on Wednesday evening and buses that are usually crammed with commuters ran almost empty.Tourists have essentially disappeared and the Vatican’s Saint Peter’s Square has closed to all but those who want to enter the basilica to pray under its soaring dome overlooking Rome.People have been told to keep at least a metre (three feet) from each other and handshakes are frowned upon. Italians have found themselves starting to talk to each other a few steps apart -- while often laughing about the regulations along the way.“As soon as the emergency has passed, we will organise a free carbonara day for doctors, nurses and healthcare workers,” a closing note by a restaurant in Rome’s popular Trastevere neighbourhood said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/to-fight-coronavirus-italy-shuts-all-shops-except-food-stores-and-pharmacies/story-U7OUETETYz9CFfx7YH0zJM.html
12-03-2020||World||In Damascus, war-scarred Syrians weary as conflict enters tenth year||The guns may have died down around Damascus as Syria’s war enters its 10th year, but florist Abdelqader Qasem says the conflict has left scars he will never forget.The 42-year-old limps slightly as he carries two tree saplings in his right hand in a city market, the empty left sleeve of his coat stuffed into his pocket.“It’ll be difficult for me to ever forget the war,” he says.“It robbed me of everything I held dearest -- my son Mazen and my left hand, as well as causing a permanent fracture in my leg,” says Qasem, who was wounded in a 2013 car bombing.Syria’s war has killed more than 380,000 people and displaced millions at home and abroad since it started on March 15, 2011 with anti-government protests.After years of fierce bombardment and fighting to expel rebels and jihadists from the capital’s doorstep, relative calm has returned to Damascus since late 2018.But residents like Qasem say they are still struggling to rebuild their lives after years of violence.Today he ekes out a living selling tree saplings, shrubs and flowers on a curb in the Damascus market.Dressed in his trademark orange coat, he places a cigarette between his lips with his right hand and lights it.“The war in Damascus has ended for many,” he says, beyond plants blooming in red, yellow and pink.“But it will stay with me until my final years,” says Qasem, who also lost his home in the war.‘Fear of poverty’Beyond the psychological scars, many Damascus residents are struggling to resume normal lives in a war-battered economy.Behind the wheel, taxi driver Nabil al-Sharif says he drives on average 15 people around the capital on a daily basis, and every day he hears them complain.“This car has become filled up to the brim with people’s worries,” says the 63-year-old.“I’ve got nerves of steel. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have been able to put up with all these endless complaints,” he said.Before 2018, he and passengers would drive around petrified of being hit and killed in rebel shelling.But today even though the fighting has ended, passengers still look drawn, he says.“People are uneasy. Fear of death has turned into fear of poverty,” says Sharif.His customers fret over the price of heating fuel or cooking gas, and the increased cost of living.The United Nations has estimated the overall cost in damages to the country’s economy since 2011 at nearly $400 billion.Pro-government economists blame the economic crunch on Western sanctions against Damascus.But they say a financial crisis in neighbouring Lebanon has also led the value of the Syrian pound to plummet on the black market.All these factors have compounded the struggle of millions of Syrians displaced by the war.‘So tired of leaving’Outside Damascus, 71-year-old Ahmad Hammada and his family are among hundreds to have sought refuge in the town of Jaramana.Walking slowly along a muddy alleyway, he says he had grown tired of constantly having to whisk his loved ones away from the fighting.“During the war, we’ve fled at least 10 times from one place to the next,” he says.“We travelled across hundreds of kilometres (miles) before arriving in the Damascus countryside,” says Hammada, who fled a home in northern Syria.He and his family now squat in a building under construction with no electricity, in a Jaramana neighbourhood that lacks proper water pipes or sewers.Inside, his 64-year-old wife Zareefa has pinned plastic sheets to the windows to try to keep out the cold and rain.She serves tea without sugar as it is now too expensive, and the stove is stone cold as her family cannot afford wood.“I feel like my whole life is nothing but war and being on the road,” she says.“It’s taken everything out of me. My children have been made homeless, my home was destroyed and we have nothing left.”To make matters even worse, they have now been told they need to leave this building too, she says, glancing at her husband and her eyes welling up.“My final wish in this life is to be able to stay in a house without being forced to leave it,” she says.“I’m so tired of leaving.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-damascus-war-scarred-syrians-weary-as-conflict-enters-tenth-year/story-cLg8JXxiDREkxPifMGQ1jP.html
12-03-2020||World||NBA suspends season ‘until further notice’ after player tests COVID-19 positive||The NBA has suspended its season “until further notice” after a Utah Jazz player tested positive Wednesday for the coronavirus, a move that came only hours after the majority of the league’s owners were leaning toward playing games without fans in arenas.Now there will be no games at all, at least for the time being. A person with knowledge of the situation said the Jazz player who tested positive was center Rudy Gobert. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because neither the league nor the team confirmed the presumptive positive test.“The NBA is suspending game play following the conclusion of tonight’s schedule of games until further notice,” the league said in a statement sent shortly after 9:30 p.m. Eastern. “The NBA will use this hiatus to determine next steps for moving forward in regard to the coronavirus pandemic.”The test result, the NBA said, was reported shortly before the scheduled tip-off time for the Utah at Oklahoma City game on Wednesday night was called off. Players were on the floor for warmups and tip-off was moments away when they were told to return to their locker rooms. About 30 minutes later, fans were told the game was postponed “due to unforeseen circumstances.”Those circumstances were the league’s worst-case scenario for now — a player testing positive. A second person who spoke to AP on condition of anonymity said the league expects the shutdown to last a minimum of two weeks, but cautioned that timeframe is very fluid.For most people, the coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, which declared a pandemic on Wednesday, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. In mainland China, where the virus first exploded, more than 80,000 people have been diagnosed and more than 58,000 have so far recovered.It has been a worldwide issue for several weeks. And now, it has hit the NBA.Charlotte Hornets coach James Borrego, speaking before his team played at Miami on Wednesday — where news of the shutdown broke during the fourth quarter — said “these are scary times.”The NBA’s movement toward empty arenas in the short term came on the same day that the NCAA announced that the men’s and women’s Division I tournaments would be played without fans — except for a few family members — permitted inside to watch.“People are clearly taking the measures that they feel they need to take for safety,” said Miami Heat guard Duncan Robinson, who played in both the Division I and Division III national championship games during his college days at Michigan and Williams.“There’s people a lot higher up than ourselves in this locker room who have the information and the knowledge to make those types of decisions,” Robinson said. “In terms of if that were to happen here ... we love playing in front of our fans and we feel like that gives us an advantage. But at the same time the NBA has to protect its players in the league and the fans.”Things have clearly been trending toward empty arenas for some time, and it was abundantly clear Wednesday morning when the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases told a Congressional committee that he would recommend the NBA not allow fans at games in response to the coronavirus.Dr. Anthony Fauci was responding to a question asked by Rep. Glenn Grothman, a Wisconsin Republican, “is the NBA underreacting or is the Ivy League overreacting?” Grothman was referencing how the Ivy League recently canceled its basketball tournaments, instead of having them without fans or keeping the status quo.“We would recommend that there not be large crowds,” Fauci said. “If that means not having any people in the audience when the NBA plays, so be it. But as a public health official, anything that has crowds is something that would give a risk to spread.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nba-suspends-season-until-further-notice-after-player-tests-positive-for-coronavirus/story-ob9yCRFglaqVYDv8fyQnsJ.html

12-03-2020||World||Amid coronavirus scare, US suspends all travel from Europe for 30 days, except UK||President Donald Trump said he will suspend all travel from Europe to the US for the next 30 days, the most far-reaching measure yet in the administration’s efforts to combat the spread of coronavirus.The restrictions, which will not apply to the UK, will go into effect Friday at midnight, he said Wednesday in an Oval Office address.The president scheduled the remarks to lay out his plan for dealing with the rapid spread of a disease he labelled a “foreign virus” that has led to more than 1,100 infections in the US and ravaged markets. The S&P 500 closed Wednesday 19% lower than its February high, with every industry down at least 3.9% on the day.“This is not a financial crisis,” Trump said. “This is just a temporary moment of time that we will overcome as a nation and as a world.”Follow latest updates on coronavirus here The World Health Organization earlier Wednesday declared the outbreak is now a pandemic and urged governments to step up containment efforts as the number of worldwide cases topped 123,000 and deaths exceeded 4,500.Trump claimed that his early action to restrict travel from China and other affected countries slowed the spread of the virus in the U.S. He said the administration is “monitoring the situation in China and South Korea,” and that “a possible early opening” could happen if the situation improves.But the president cast blame on Europe, which he said had failed to take similar precautions and thereby contributed to the virus taking hold in the US.The president asked Congress to take action to deliver paid sick leave to hourly workers who risk their livelihoods if they stay home. He also recommended that nursing homes curtail non-medically necessary visits.Trump said he is deferring tax payments for certain individuals and businesses affected by the virus. He said the deferments would provide $200 billion in additional liquidity.Trump added that he is instructing the Small Business Administration to provide emergency capital to affected firms.“This is the most aggressive and comprehensive effort to confront a foreign virus in modern history,” Trump said. “I am confident that by counting and continuing to take these tough measures we will significantly reduce the threat to our citizens and we will ultimately and expeditiously defeat this virus.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-coronavirus-scare-us-suspends-all-travel-from-europe-for-30-days-except-uk/story-CqENAS34lvEf1Yu9rLNPMK.html

We are dependent on supply lines from various countries. We are looking into it all the time,” Netanyahu told a press conference on Wednesday. Also Watch | Coronavirus: What we know and what we don’tHis remarks came during joint statements with the finance minister, the economy and industry minister, the Bank of Israel’s governor and the finance ministry director general on dealing with the economic implications of the coronavirus. The Israeli Prime Minister’s Office, however, did not clearly spell out the subject of Netanyahu’s discussions with Modi in its press release.  The Israeli prime minister has announced a package of 10 billion NIS (USD 2.86 billion) to facilitate economic activity in the midst of challenges posed by the spread of the virus. “The Israeli economy is in a better situation than most economies in the world: Unemployment is low, growth is high and the debt to GDP ratio is good,” Netanyahu said.“However, we have a great challenge here that we all are feeling and which we are all aware of. In our view, we can also deal with it in a way that will allow us to get through it successfully in peace,” he said. “Not without difficulty, and not without sacrifice, but in the end, in peace, and I think that we can do this together in an optimal manner,” Netanyahu asserted .The package lays special stress on the health sector and other businesses impacted by the coronavirus such as tourism and the aviation sector.

Enterprises and employment – two aspects of China’s $14 trillion economy hit badly by the infection.Within 24 hours of Xi’s visit, the worst-hit Hubei province government allowed Wuhan businesses involved in providing daily necessities, preventing and controlling the epidemic, or operating public utilities to resume work and production immediately – the first easing of tight restrictions in place since January 23.Wuhan firms that are key to “global industrial chains” may do so as well, after getting approval, the government added.Soon after Xi’s Wuhan visit, official news agency, Xinhua, released a news report on factories gradually resuming work in China. Also Watch | Coronavirus: China confirms 22 new deaths, President XI Jinping visits Wuhan“China has all the industrial categories classified by the United Nations. It also ranks first in terms of output in nearly half of the over 500 major industrial products in the world. Though the novel coronavirus outbreak has slowed the humming of the factories for a while, production has been resuming across the country as the outbreak is leveling off to ensure the smooth operation of the global supply chain,” the report said.It’s a remarkable achievement for companies to resume work in a city that has been ravaged by the pathogen, reporting hundreds of cases daily until weeks ago.However, the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong, Xi, 66, knows the path to economic rejuvenation for the world’s second-largest economy will be tough.The human toll aside, the “devil” covid-19 has hammered the Chinese economy, which was anyway facing the twin gauntlets of a gradual slowdown and the trade war with the US.Beijing has introduced countermeasures against the epidemic’s economic fallout.It includes increasing government spending, lowering lending rates, and boosting credit support for companies.In February, the People’s Bank of China, the central bank, injected some 1.7 trillion yuan ($242 billion) of liquidity in the market and launched a $300 billion re-lending funds for commercial banks.“The Chinese government has cut down the tax rate for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), one of the sectors worst hit by the epidemic,” economist Zhang Ming from the influential, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) said.Companies in Tibet, Xinjiang and several provinces have even hired flights, trains and buses to bring back migrant labour to resume work at projects and factories.Experts like Beijing-based economist Hu Xingdou told HT that the government needs to invest in infrastructure and in the health sector to spur growth.It will take a lot more doing.In January, the outbreak hit where it hurts a lot: The Chinese New Year festival rush and the holidays, a boom time for the Chinese economy.The epidemic triggered massive losses in the travel and tourism industries besides dampening consumption during the most important holidays on the local calendar.According to an estimate made by Zhu Min, former IMF deputy managing director and currently with the prestigious Tsinghua University (quoted by Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post) it is likely to have cost the tourism industry about 900 billion yuan (US$128 billion) in January and February compared with 2019 while general spending on food and entertainment was likely to have fallen by about 420 billion yuan (US$59.7 billion).“The impact of the epidemic on consumption, manufacturing, construction, the export sector and on inflation mean that the GDP growth rate in the first quarter will be around 3% to 4%,’’ CASS’s Zhang said.There are two broad problem areas that China will need to tackle, Chan Kung, chief researcher with the Beijing-based independent think-tank, Anbound, said.“The first, which is the already-frustrating (state of) government finances, already extremely tight, and is known for its worryingly high levels of debt. With the covid-19 outbreak in the picture, the country will now require an even larger allocation in its budget to remedy the problem, thereby resulting in a heavier financial burden for the government,” Chan said“The second is that a portion of China’s enterprises probably would face a flood of bankruptcies. This is not much an issue for government-backed SOEs, but for private enterprises, however, they are at severe risk of facing bankruptcy and it is predicted that these businesses will have insufficient cash flows to last for the Chinaquarter,” Anbound’s Chan added.Experts say signs of a better economy are visible on the horizon.“Only six weeks after the initial outbreak, China appears to be in the early stages of recovery. Congestion delays currently stand at 73% of 2019 levels, up from 62% at the worst part of the epidemic, indicating that the movement of people and goods is resuming. Similarly, coal consumption appears to be recovering from a trough of 43% to currently 75% of 2019 levels, indicating that some production is resuming. And confidence appears to be coming back as seen in real estate transactions, which had fallen to 1% of 2019 levels but have since bounced back to 47%,” the Harvard Business Review said in an insight piece on Tuesday.And from amid the thorny bouquet of economic adversities, Chinese companies picked out opportunities – mostly in the online sector.The Sars epidemic of 2002-03 was behind the fast development of e-commerce in China.Similarly, the current crisis will give further impetus to the online industry, which is already more than robust in China, Beijing-based economist, Hu, quoted earlier said. It’s still a hard road ahead.“If the economy recovers after the first quarter, and we see a growth of 5.5% to 5.6%, it will be satisfactory,” CASS’s Zhang said.Back in Wuhan on Tuesday, President Xi told a covid-19 patient: “What you should do now is stay confident. We all should be confident that we will win this war”.The disease is likely on the wane in China but the economic debris it will leave behind will take more than just confidence to clear.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-resilient-china-believes-it-is-time-to-crank-up-the-economy/story-bwJdEblBDVl19U7uJLH1tI.html
12-03-2020||World||US, UK troops among 3 dead in Iraq rocket attack: US official||An American soldier, a British soldier and one US contractor were killed Wednesday, a US official said, in the deadliest rocket attack in years on an Iraqi military base hosting foreign troops.The attack threatens a dangerous escalation, with suspected US-led coalition air strikes promptly targeting Iran-aligned Iraqi fighters in neighbouring Syria, a war monitor said.On Wednesday evening, a volley of rockets hit the Taji air base north of Baghdad, which hosts troops from the US-led coalition helping local forces battle jihadists.A coalition official first told AFP the force had sustained “several” injuries on Wednesday ranging from “light to critical,” but a US military official later confirmed three deaths.The Iraqi military said the rockets were fired from the back of a truck, but it did not comment on any casualties.There was no initial comment from Washington or London on those killed, nor was there an immediate claim of responsibility.Washington has blamed Iran-backed factions from Iraq’s Hashed al-Shaabi military network, which is incorporated into the Iraqi state, for similar violence in the recent past.Within hours of Wednesday’s attack, three warplanes likely belonging to the US-led coalition bombed Hashed factions stationed on the Syrian side of the border with Iraq, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor.“Ten explosions shook the area near Albukamal,” said Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman, citing a Syrian border town with a heavy Hashed presence.Hardline Hashed factions have fought alongside Syrian government forces for several years and have been targeted by both coalition and Israeli air strikes in Syria.Wednesday’s attack on the Taji air base was the 22nd on US installations in Iraq, including the American embassy, since late October.One of the earlier attacks killed an Iraqi soldier and in late December, a spree of rockets killed a US contractor working at a base in northern Iraq.That killing sent tensions spiralling.Two days later, the US responded by bombing Kataeb Hezbollah, a faction within the Hashed that is heavily backed by Iran and which Washington has blamed for several rocket attacks.At least 25 Kataeb Hezbollah fighters were killed and their supporters on 31 December besieged the US embassy in Baghdad.A US drone strike outside the Baghdad airport on January 3 killed powerful Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani and the Hashed’s deputy chief Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis.Iran then retaliated by launching a volley of missiles at the western Iraqi base of Ain Al-Asad. While no personnel were killed in that attack, dozens of US soldiers suffered from brain trauma.The tit-for-tat attacks on Iraqi soil left Baghdad furious, and in January its parliament voted to expel all foreign soldiers from Iraq in reaction to the killing of Soleimani.Among them are some 5,200 US forces stationed across Iraq as part of the international coalition -- comprised of dozens of countries -- formed in 2014 to confront the Islamic State jihadist group, which took swathes of territory that year.While IS has lost its territory, sleeper cells remain capable of carrying out attacks.On Sunday, two US soldiers were killed while helping Iraqi forces battle IS remnants north of Baghdad.Parliament’s vote on the ouster must be implemented by the government, but the current caretaker cabinet has yet to make progress on the decision.US officials previously told AFP they considered the Hashed as a bigger threat to them than IS, given the frequency and accuracy of rocket attacks on American troops that could be traced back to the Shiite-majority network.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-uk-troops-among-3-dead-in-iraq-rocket-attack-us-official/story-p733KHL1y71Uy2ejtb8Q9M.html
12-03-2020||World||After Wuhan trials, China to mass produce rapid test kits||China is getting ready for the rapid screening of people for coronavirus if there’s a spike in cases as millions of people resume work across the country.Until now, China’s National Medical Products Administration has approved 10 new coronavirus nucleic acid detection reagents and six antibody detection reagents.As the number of new cases drops in China, the test kits, if mass-produced, could well be exported.Doctors at the coronavirus epidemic epicentre of Wuhan are said to be using a 15-minute test kit to detect antibodies to the pathogen — then go for a nucleic acid test for the final confirmation, which takes a few hours.The test kits helped them to check patients at a time when Wuhan’s medical facilities were flooded with suspected patients.The rapid test kit was developed in the city of Wuxi, in China’s Jiangsu by scientists from National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention and a company based in Wuxi city, a state media report said.“The kit can detect the virus within eight to 15 minutes,” the city’s bureau of science and technology told state media. The kit was deployed in Wuhan because it had “high sensitivity and is easy to use and transport”.The company had then said it could produce kits for 4,000 people a day, and the city government was helping the company expand production.The first batch of the kits was used in Wuhan in early February.Several institutes and companies in China are continuing research on developing rapid testing kits, possibly with the idea of exporting the kits as the outbreak surges globally.On March 7, another rapid testing kit to detect the Covid-19 antibody with results available in 29 minutes was approved by China’s National Medical Products Administration.This kit was developed by a research team led by experts from Xiamen University. “The kit can be used for clinical cases, suspected cases and the screening of high-risk groups, improving the testing efficiency of front-line medical institutions,” the official news agency, Xinhua reported.According to state media, the kit was going through clinical trials in hospitals in Wuhan.“The combination of nucleic acid tests and antibody detection has improved the detection rate. According to the developer, three antibody reagents for Covid-19 have been approved by the European Union and exported to countries including Italy, Austria and the Netherlands,” the report said.On Wednesday, a group of Chinese medical scientists said they have developed yet another rapid antibody test that can diagnose the coronavirus within 15 minutes by testing a drop of blood from the fingertips.Led by Chinese top medical expert Zhong Nanshan, who is heading the Chinese government’s anti-epidemic task force, the team said that the antibody test aims to offer an accurate and rapid method to quickly identify infected patients and asymptomatic carriers of the virus.According to the tabloid, Global Times, clinical studies of the new test kit have been carried out in eight clinical sites across the country, which validated the clinical detection sensitivity, specificity and clinical efficacy of the new test kit. “Compared with the nucleic acid RTPCR test (to detect and measure RNA), which takes 3-4 hours to produce results, the new kit can detect the antibodies against the virus in human blood within 15 minutes with an overall testing the sensitivity of 88.66% and specificity of 90.63%,” the Global Times report said. The report said the team found that the clinical diagnosis results obtained from finger blood, serum and plasma of venous blood indicated great detection consistency, which means there will be a more convenient test method in the future by only testing the finger blood of a suspected patient.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-wuhan-trials-china-to-mass-produce-rapid-test-kits/story-skDzYSSC9hgE45FDW2MSJP.html
12-03-2020||World||Michelle Obama’s Detroit rally called off amid coronavirus scare||A voter participation rally in Detroit that was to feature former first lady Michelle Obama was cancelled Wednesday because of concerns over the new coronavirus.The March 27 ticketed event at the University of Detroit Mercy will not be held “out of an abundance of caution for the health and safety of attendees and individuals travelling to Detroit,” When We All Vote said in a release.The non-partisan, non-profit voter advocacy organization also says it is exploring options to reschedule the event. Obama co-chairs When We All Vote and helped launch the organization in 2018 to boost voting.Fears over the spread of the virus have prompted the cancellation of a number of events around the country. Some college sporting events will be played in arenas without fans in attendance. UCLA, Yale, Stanford and other schools also have announced plans to send students home and move classes online.The virus has infected more than 1,000 people in the U.S. and killed at least 30.Michigan officials announced Tuesday night that two middle-aged people in the Detroit area tested positive for COVID-19.For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.An Oakland County woman who travelled outside the country and a Wayne County man who travelled within the U.S. are being treated for COVID-19 at area hospitals. Both cases still need to be reviewed and confirmed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Local officials will identify those who have been in close contact with the infected adults and make sure they are tested, if necessary, and monitored, said Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, Michigan’s medical executive.In Michigan, 77 people had been tested as of Tuesday. Fifty seven were negative, two positive and results were pending for 18.The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. China, where the virus first exploded, has had more than 81,000 infections and more than 3,000 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/michelle-obama-s-detroit-rally-called-off-amid-coronavirus-scare/story-UdDIfihRM9svcMeJppGDTN.html

12-03-2020||World||Joe Biden extends lead over rival Bernie Sanders||Former US vice-president Joe Biden extended his lead over Senator Bernie Sanders, winning four of the six states that held their Democratic presidential nominating contests on Tuesday, including the prize catch of the evening, Michigan.Biden also picked up Mississippi, Missouri and Idaho, continuing his winning spree from the South Carolina primaries. He had gone on to win 10 of the 14 states that polled in the Super Tuesday contests last week in a stunning reversal of fortunes, resurrecting his campaign against all odds.Washington state and North Dakota, the other two battlegrounds that went to polls this Tuesday, are still counting their votes; and Sanders is projected to take North Dakota. Biden struck a conciliatory tone in his victory speech in Philadelphia. “I want to thank Bernie Sanders and his supporters for their tireless passion,” he said, with his wife Jill Biden by his side. “We share a common goal and together we’ll defeat (US President) Donald Trump.” The results of the Super Tuesday II contests may not have sealed the race yet for Biden, but they certainly made Sanders’ path to the nomination highly improbable because of the widening gap between him and the former vice-president in terms of the tally of delegates required to reach the finishing line of 1,991. Biden currently leads Sanders 724-591. Sanders had won four of these six states in the 2016 primaries against Hillary Clinton, including Michigan. And his chances look bleak in the next four states that hold their nominating contests next Tuesday that are likely to put Biden even further out his reach.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-extends-lead-over-rival-bernie-sanders/story-f6bcIh6uH746MansBHhUXO.html
