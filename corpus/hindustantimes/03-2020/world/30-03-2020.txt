Error - look out for bad grammar and spelling’.Noting that some countries “routinely use disinformation as a policy tool,” officials said the government is also stepping up efforts to share its assessments on coronavirus disinformation with international partners.Culture secretary Oliver Dowden said: “We’re working with social media companies, and I’ll be pressing them this week for further action to stem the spread of falsehoods and rumours which could cost lives”.“When false narratives are identified, the government’s Rapid Response Unit coordinates with departments across Whitehall to deploy the appropriate response. This can include a direct rebuttal on social media, working with platforms to remove harmful content and ensuring public health campaigns are promoted through reliable sources”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-uk-is-battling-fake-covid-19-claims-amid-this-pandemic/story-ujSwqWlHHehtqVG07rfuLK.html
30-03-2020||World||Fever heatmaps hint turning point in US’ Covid-19 cases soon: JP Morgan analysts||The turning point in the continuing increase in Covid-19 cases in United States’ hospitals may happen in a matter of days rather than weeks, two analysts at financial services firm JP Morgan have said.The analysts made the projection on the basis of data from kinsa Insights, the healthcare firm that has generated heat maps from over a million internet-connected thermometers used by people all over the US.In the past, the data generated by the thermometers have been able to predict flu hotspots on the basis of fever spikes much before the federal government’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention received the information.It was also able to predict outbreaks of Covid-19, the disease caused by the Sars-Co-2 pathogen, much before the CDC’s surveillance programme that uses hospital records spotted it. Fever is one of the telltale signs of Covid-19. The World Health Organization says 90 percent of COVID-19 patients have high fever as an early symptom.In a report, the New York Times pointed out how Kinsa’s data had recently indicated an unusual rise in fevers in South Florida, even though it was not known to be a Covid-19 epicenter. South Florida became a Covid-19 hotspot days later. But the data also pointed to spots in Florida, Michigan, Arizona and eastern Texas, where not as many cases have been reported, a report in the NYT said.The company, which compares anonymised thermometer reading to historical trends, calls it an “early warning system” for illness.Analysts at JP Morgan, who have been tracking the fever data made available by the firm, found that the Covid-19 pandemic started spreading in March with atypical illness readings peaking in the third week of this month, and has been declining since then. The real time data leads the hospitalisation data by about 5 to 10 days, possibly the time taken by an individual to test and be hospitalised.The analysts spotted an inflection of atypical influenza fly in the third week in real time data to conclude that it appeared the containment measures in the US were showing results. This, the analysis concluded, implied that the turning point in hospital admissions is likely to be in terms of a number of days, rather than number of weeks. This would imply, it said, that economic activity may restart sooner than what had been expected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fever-heatmaps-hint-turning-point-in-us-covid-19-cases-soon-jp-morgan-analysts/story-fCaXs5WTgA7sJyxnU7vT9I.html
30-03-2020||World||UK’s Prince Harry, wife Meghan, do not need US help for security costs||Britain’s Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, have no plans to ask the U.S. government for help with security costs, the couple said in a statement on Sunday in response to a tweet from President Donald Trump that the United States would not pay for their protection.In January, the couple said they would step away from their royal duties and according to media reports, recently relocated to Los Angeles.Earlier on Sunday, Trump tweeted: “Now they have left Canada for the U.S. however, the U.S. will not pay for their security protection. They must pay!”A spokeswoman for the couple said later in a statement: “The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have no plans to ask the U.S. government for security resources. Privately funded security arrangements have been made.”The duchess, Meghan Markle, who married Prince Harry, the grandson of Britain’s Queen Elizabeth, in 2018, criticized Trump during his 2016 election campaign as misogynistic and divisive.Last year, Trump, on being told of Meghan’s criticism, said: “I didn’t know that. What can I say? I didn’t know that she was nasty.” But he also wished her well in her new life as a British royal.The couple stunned the royal family in early January with an announcement they would be stepping down from their roles as senior royals, in order to gain freedom from the intense media scrutiny that has followed them for several years.They had been living for several months with their son, Archie, on Vancouver Island in Canada.Britain’s Sun newspaper reported last week that the couple took a private flight to Los Angeles, but did not say when. Earlier this month, the United States and Canada agreed to close their border to non-essential travel at land crossings to ease the strain on health systems caused by the coronavirus.Meghan Markle was raised in the Los Angeles area and her mother, Doria, still lives there. Walt Disney Co said last week that Meghan had narrated a nature documentary that will be released on its Disney+ streaming platform on Friday.Last month, Canada said it would no longer provide security once the couple were no longer working members of the British royal family.The Royal Canadian Mounted Police had been assisting London’s Metropolitan Police with security for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex “intermittently” since November, when the couple began a six-week vacation in Canada, Reuters reported in February.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-s-prince-harry-wife-meghan-do-not-need-us-help-for-security-costs/story-4nYIhKO3DV8Z1e5orEkGLL.html
30-03-2020||World||Covid-19 response prompts PM Boris Johnson to refute Margaret Thatcher’s beliefs||The coronavirus pandemic is making people do things they would have never contemplated. Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Sunday evening refuted one of the most famous contentions of Margaret Thatcher, one of his party’s former prime ministers.“There is no such thing as society,” Thatcher said in 1987 as part of her set of beliefs that aimed for free markets and a small state. Instead of planning and regulating business and people’s lives, she believed the government’s job is to get out of the way.In isolation after testing positive for coronavirus, a slightly hoarse Johnson appeared in a video clip, hailing thousands of retired doctors and health professionals returning to the front-line of the National Health Service, besides lakhs of volunteers registering to help.Contradicting Thatcher’s endorsement of pure individualism, Johnson said: “We are going to do it, we are going to do it together. One thing I think the coronavirus crisis has already proved is that there really is such a thing as society.”Some commentators believe the pandemic is Johnson’s ‘Churchill moment’: he in charge at a time when the United Kingdom is facing a major national crisis, just as Winston Churchill famously led the country during World War II.Johnson’s aides insist he continues to lead the government’s response to the pandemic, chairing meetings through video-conferencing from inside the prime minister’s residence in Downing Street.He said: “Thank you to everybody who’s now coming back into the NHS in such huge numbers. Just this evening I can tell you we have 20,000 NHS staff coming back to the colours”.“It’s a most amazing thing. And that’s in addition to the 750,000 members of the public who have volunteered to help us get through this crisis.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-response-prompts-pm-boris-johnson-to-refute-margaret-thatcher-s-beliefs/story-ZdtBsbHOPKt2vnLueqlxsL.html

30-03-2020||World||Gulf’s massive migrant workforce fears virus limbo||Millions of migrant workers across the Gulf face uncertainty as host countries lock down, employers withhold wages or mull redundancies, and strict coronavirus containment measures lead to deportations and confinement.“We’ve been in lockdown for the last eight to 10 days, we don’t know when it will end,” said a 27-year-old Pakistani engineer in Qatar beginning a second week under mandatory quarantine.“The basic issue we are facing now is groceries. The government is providing us with food but only after some days -- and little things only.”He is among tens of thousands of workers strictly confined to Doha’s Industrial Area after dozens in the blue-collar district tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.Advocacy groups including Human Rights Watch (HRW) and Amnesty warn that cramped accommodation and inadequate sanitation endanger migrant workers across the Gulf, who may not have access to healthcare.They also face salaries going unpaid and arbitrary dismissal or deportation -- an outcome that could spell disaster for families at home dependent on their income.‘Already disadvantaged’“Migrant workers in the Gulf are already disadvantaged (under) a labour governance system that gives employers excessive powers over migrant workers and drives their abuse and exploitation,” HRW’s Gulf researcher Hiba Zayadin told AFP. “Gulf countries should go above and beyond in introducing measures to prevent the spread of the virus in migrant accommodations and migrant detention centres.”With the region so far reporting 3,200 cases of the disease, Amnesty said that workers “trapped in camps” are particularly vulnerable, enduring conditions that make social distancing impossible.Foreign workers in the oil-rich Gulf region, predominantly from Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan, account for around 10 percent of all migrants worldwide.Many who spoke to AFP say they now fear for their health and job security.Saudis receive paid leaveSome labourers in Saudi Arabia, home to 10 million expat workers, complained that they were required by bosses to work while Saudis were permitted paid quarantine leave.One said he was told to accept unpaid leave if he felt unwell, but opted to continue working.“Many workers in the private sector are suffering due to the closure of most sectors, as many owners force the workers to sit in their homes without a salary,” an Arab diplomat based in Riyadh told AFP.“And despite the kingdom’s compensation to the private sector, the owners use it to cover their losses due to the closure without caring for the workers.”After Saudi Arabia, the UAE hosts the Gulf’s second largest migrant labour force with 8.7 million, followed by Kuwait with 2.8 million.In Kuwait, Um Sabrine, an Egyptian beauty salon manager, said she would not be paid because of the government’s closure of non-essential businesses.While she plans to sue her employer, many in the region are reluctant to speak out for fear of reprisals. Others believe the health situation is worse in their home countries.World Cup rolls onGas-rich Qatar’s record on migrant labour has been under the spotlight since it won the right to host the 2022 World Cup, with seven new football stadiums as well as towering skyscrapers to be built by an army of foreign workers. Ninety percent of Qatar’s 2.75 million people are expats. Many are from developing countries and working on projects linked to the tournament -- stadium construction has continued even as other businesses have shuttered. Rights groups have previously criticised labour practices in Qatar, which has responded with initiatives to enhance worker welfare. But the lockdown of the densely populated Industrial Area has drawn scrutiny.“They identified a ground-zero and it was very easy for them to shut it down quickly,” said one Western diplomat. “Would they have done it if it had been somewhere in the Pearl? I don’t know,” she added, referring to an artificial island popular with wealthy expatriates.Qatari officials insisted last week’s sealing of the area, now ringed by police, was essential to save lives. They also say they have flooded the area with medical resources and pledged to pay missed salaries.‘I’m scared’ The International Labour Organization’s Doha office said several employers had transferred staff to more spacious lodgings over fears cramped conditions could incubate the virus, while others have improved hygiene.A Sri Lankan supermarket worker, 23, said his communal villa was sanitised and cleaned in response to COVID-19, but anxiety persisted.“I’m homesick -- my mother keeps asking me to come back.”One Turkish salesman, 49, told AFP he was self-isolating as a precaution and was on unpaid leave.“I’m scared to get infected,” said the man who, like many Gulf expats, is ineligible for sick pay.At least 20 Nepalese migrant labourers were deported by Qatar for ignoring containment rules, Nepalese officials told AFP, even though Kathmandu has sought to block returnees.The ILO questioned how long companies could continue paying workers as the crisis continues, chilling Gulf economies which have been blindsided by the plunge in oil prices.Mass redundancies, avoided so far, would do huge economic damage to countries sending labour to the region, said the head of the ILO’s Qatar office, Houtan Homayounpour.“The impact is disastrous.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gulf-s-massive-migrant-workforce-fears-virus-limbo/story-S2vBKDglyH7OHfv8HVrPlN.html

Its embassy in Ottawa tweeted about the Bank of China donating medical supplies to Canada.Probably chastened by the experience of other nations like the Netherlands, the Czech Republic and Spain, Trudeau made it clear any such material will have to pass Canadian quality standards. During his daily media appearance, Trudeau said he wanted to assure Canadians that “Health Canada has very strong procedures for evaluating, ensuring what we get is up to the necessary standards and there will be no corners cut on this one.”He added that such supplies that health care workers rely on to keep them safe “is of a quality that is going to actually do the job.”That statement came even as the Dutch Government recalled 600,000 defective masks received from China and similar reports relating to testing units have risen in other countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-update-ensuring-no-corners-cut-says-canadian-pm-trudeau-on-quality-of-equipment-sent-by-china/story-qKpqbCZ4Fye9FUY68ndNxM.html
30-03-2020||World||Russia moves toward nationwide lockdown as coronavirus spreads||Russia moved toward a lockdown across the world’s largest country by area on Monday to try and halt the spread of coronavirus, following Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin’s order for residents to stay in their homes.Heads of all Russia’s regions should adopt similar restrictions as those announced in the capital and surrounding areas, Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said at a televised meeting with deputy premiers.Moscow’s 12.7 million people were ordered to stay home starting Monday, with limited exceptions for emergencies, in the strictest measures yet imposed in a major Russian city. Confirmed infections in Moscow jumped overnight to 1,014 on Sunday and make up two-thirds of the country’s total.Sobyanin warned in a website statement that the expansion of the virus in Europe’s largest capital city “has entered a new phase.” He said that the authorities will shortly introduce passes to permit movements outside the home in the coming days, with a “smart system” of remote monitoring to ensure compliance.Other than for emergency medical reasons or work obligations, residents will be allowed to walk outside their homes only to visit their nearest food store or pharmacy, to take out trash, or to take pet animals within 100 meters of their buildings. While outside, people will be required to maintain a distance of at least 1.5 meters from others.The lock-down comes after Sobyanin ordered last week non-essential businesses to close to slow the spread of the illness. He has been among Russia’s most vocal proponents of tough restrictions to counter coronavirus in a crisis that has undermined the Kremlin’s ability to get its message out clearly.“Movement in the city is down by two-thirds and that’s very good,” Sobyanin said in the statement. “But it’s obvious that far from everyone has heard our message.”The World Health Organization’s representative in Russia complained at the weekend that Muscovites were flouting the authorities’ advice to stay home and keep “social distancing.” The capital was packed with people out on the streets in warm spring weather on Saturday and other regions saw a sudden influx of Moscow residents taking advantage of a week-long paid time off decreed by Putin.Nikolai Malyshev, a leading infectious diseases specialist in the Health Ministry, warned on state TV last week that Russia is readying itself for an “explosive development like a nuclear reaction” with the coronavirus epidemic. In the near future, “large numbers of people will fall ill and need medical treatment,” he said.Sobyanin said people will still be able to leave or enter Moscow but the new rules are aimed at restricting “moving around the city without any reason.”Non-Working WeekPutin announced in a March 25 national address that this week will be a non-working one. But he didn’t commit to any drastic measures limiting movement, instead promising benefits to get companies and individuals through the crisis. After signs that many Russians had interpreted the measure as an opportunity to take vacation, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Friday that the president’s statement was really an order to work from home.Putin’s top public health official, Anna Popova, as recently as last Monday ruled out locking down the capital, while Sobyanin pushed a harder line the following day, warning the president that the number of reported cases of the coronavirus understated the problem.While its total number of declared cases is still low by comparison with many other countries, Russia has been adopting progressively stricter measures against coronavirus in the past week. The government halted all international flights as of Friday and Mishustin called on regions to close most businesses, while stopping short of ordering them to do so. The government closed all of Russia’s land borders effective Monday.Russia is also mobilizing the army to help battle the epidemic, and the Defense Ministry announced plans to build 16 hospitals to treat coronavirus patients around the country by mid-May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-moves-toward-nationwide-lockdown-as-coronavirus-spreads/story-GPgh3iLcoKRzgzPmu1PvlK.html

The Health Ministry generally requires 14-day self-isolation and possible coronavirus testing for anyone deemed to have been in proximity with an infected person. Israeli media said the aide had been present at a parliament session last week attended by Netanyahu as well as opposition lawmakers with whom he is trying to build an emergency coalition government to help address the coronavirus crisis.Israel has reported 4,247 cases and 15 fatalities. With the Health Ministry warning that the dead could eventually number in the thousands, Netanyahu was due on Monday to convene officials on Monday to discuss a proposed lockdown of some of the country.Netanyahu was tested for coronavirus as a precaution on March 15, his office said. The result was negative.

The grocer called 911 and reported a disturbance, following which the deputies arrived the store, they said. In a Facebook post, Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said the deputies responded to the disturbance call at the Food City. He said the teen “intentionally coughed on produce”. “Apparently it was a prank,” wrote Gonzalez. “Not a very funny one. The teen was charged with Tampering with Consumer Products.” The incident took place at a time when confirmed cases of novel coronavirus are on the rise in Houston area. As of Sunday noon, COVID-19 cases in the area have climbed to 928. An estimated 58 people in the area who have tested positive for the virus have recovered, according to reports from a number of health officials. Meanwhile, Governor Greg Abbott is tightening travel to Texas by ordering some motorists from Louisiana to self-quarantine for two weeks. The new travel restrictions come as Louisiana’s status as a novel coronavirus hotspot grew Sunday to more than 3,500 positive cases statewide. Abbott said drivers with commercial, medical, emergency response, military or critical infrastructure purposes for entering Texas would be exempted. State troopers will enforce the order at checkpoints at major roadways along the border. Those asked to quarantine will be required to provide an address for where they plan to hold up in Texas, either for two weeks or until their return to Louisiana, whichever comes first.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-14-year-old-charged-for-playing-prank-coughing-on-groceries-in-us-store/story-XyMhrdAnFk7QdI8WVGUw6O.html
30-03-2020||World||Twitter removes two Bolsonaro tweets questioning Covid-19 quarantine||Two tweets by Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro in which he questioned quarantine measures aimed at containing the novel coronavirus were removed Sunday, on the grounds that they violated the social network’s rules.The far-right leader had posted several videos in which he flouted his government’s social distancing guidelines by mixing with supporters on the streets of Brasilia and urging them to keep the economy going.Two of the posts were removed and replaced with a notice explaining why they had been taken down.Twitter explained in a statement that it had recently expanded its global rules on managing content that contradicted public health information from official sources and could put people at greater risk of transmitting COVID-19.In one of the deleted videos, Bolsonaro tells a street vendor, “What I have been hearing from people is that they want to work.”“What I have said from the beginning is that ‘we are going to be careful, the over-65s stay at home,’“ he said.“We just can’t stand still, there is fear because if you don’t die of the disease, you starve,” the vendor is seen telling Bolsonaro, who responds: “You’re not going to die!”In another video, the president calls for a “return to normality,” questioning quarantine measures imposed by governors and some mayors across the giant South American country as an effective containment measure against the virus.“If it continues like this, with the amount of unemployment what we will have later is a very serious problem that will take years to be resolved,” he said of the isolation measures.“Brazil cannot stop or we’ll turn into Venezuela,” Bolsonaro later told reporters outside his official residence.On Saturday, Health Minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta highlighted the importance of containment as a means of fighting the coronavirus, which has already infected 3,904 people in Brazil, leaving 114 dead, according to the latest official figures.“Some people want me to shut up, follow the protocols,” said Bolsonaro. “How many times does the doctor not follow the protocol?”“Let’s face the virus with reality. It is life, we must all die one day.”In the four videos posted on his Twitter account, Bolsonaro is seen surrounded by small crowds as he walked about the capital.Bolsonaro has described the coronavirus as “a flu” and advocated the reopening of schools and shops, with self-isolation necessary solely for the over-60s.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-removes-two-bolsonaro-tweets-questioning-covid-19-quarantine/story-QO1juYep0io6eNSad9BIQP.html
30-03-2020||World||Coronavirus Update: Demand explodes for New York food banks as job losses rise due to Covid-19||New York food banks have become inundated with newcomers deprived of income since the near-total halt of business in the United States’ economic capital.Sacks of oranges, sweet potatoes and onions are spread over three tables at an open-air market in Washington Heights, a neighbourhood in the north of Manhattan. Sterilized milk and cans of tuna and salmon cover three others. Hundreds of people came over the weekend to restock at the distribution center, one of many run by City Harvest, a major New York-based charity.There are no long lines reminiscent of the soup kitchens of the 1930s. Instead, people trickle in, often wearing masks for protection and keeping their distance from each other under the direction of market volunteers.Among the customers is Lina Alba, 40, a single mother with five children aged between 11 and 23. She worked as a maid in a Manhattan hotel until it closed two weeks ago.Her two oldest children also lost their jobs.“It is my first time,” she said. “We need the help now. This is crazy. So we don’t know what’s gonna happen in a few weeks.”She’s trying to stay positive, though. “At least I’m spending time with my kids... I am the teacher, I am the mom -- I am everything.”“We are alive, we are healthy, we just need to pray.”It took the single mother a week to register for unemployment -- the service flooded, pointing to much worse unemployment numbers than those announced by the federal government on Thursday.But on Friday, “I did it, finally,” Alba said, relieved.The benefits should start arriving in three weeks. Alba also hopes to receive soon at least $1,200 from the federal government, thanks to a historic aid package passed last week by Congress.“It’s not gonna be enough,” but “you’re gonna appreciate anything right now,” she said, noting that “a lot of people” need help.“It is the whole entire city.”Millions need help Jose Neri, 51, is one of many Hispanic employees who worked in now-closed New York restaurants. He also came to a food bank for the first time.There are five people in his family. “We’re using our savings to survive,” he said in Spanish, wearing a mask and gloves in an effort to prevent himself from catching the virus.“We’ve got what we need to hold it together for now,” he said. He is also counting on the federal government’s promised assistance to low-income workers.Jhordana Ramirez, 39, has to keep working, despite the high risk of infection in a city that has recorded tens of thousands of cases.She’s a home caregiver for senior citizens, who “depend 100 percent” on her, she explained in Spanish.The pandemic has had an “enormous” effect on her household, she said. Her husband and oldest daughter lost their jobs. Her youngest daughter, just eight years old, is “anxious” and can’t keep still.“I try to save as much as possible, especially for the rent, bills like electricity, cable, food and all those things,” she said. She is also impatiently waiting for her federal check.City Harvest employee Geraldine Fermin has heard stories like this a lot since most New York City business closed down two weeks ago.“It’s heartbreaking that it has to be like that for a lot of people,” she said.“People that were poor are now poorer, and people that had decent jobs, that could get by, now are poor too.”“Before, there were 1.2 million people in New York who needed help for food. Now, there are three times as many, that’s more than three million New Yorkers,” said City Harvest vice president Eric Ripert.Ripert also owns the famous restaurant Le Bernardin, closed due to the coronavirus.Speaking in French, Ripert said that City Harvest, which in addition to its markets also supplies food to some 400 homeless shelters, does not currently have any supply problems.But it needs funds to buy more food, and so it is teaming up with other organizations to create a united front against “a situation that will get worse.”“We got through September 11, the great recession of 2008-2009, we got through a lot of things, but none of that is comparable to this catastrophe that we’re living through,” Ripert said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-demand-explodes-for-new-york-food-banks-as-job-losses-rise-due-to-covid-19/story-0BW2gal5rr2lJuIrUbvbKL.html

Airport authorities were waiting for police investigators to examine the crash scene before retrieving the remains, Monreal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/plane-catches-fire-at-manila-airport-all-8-aboard-killed/story-00mS4AvEwRTh5xG7gvNYoM.html

President Ashraf Ghani’s political rival Abdullah Abdullah has not confirmed whether he will support the delegation, potentially important given his camp’s strong influence in the north and west.Several dead as clashes continueOn Friday, militants attacked several districts of northeastern Badakhshan province, capturing three districts and killing at least 10 Afghan security forces, an official said.Several Taliban fighters were also killed when reinforcements were sent to the area.Clashes also occurred between the police and the Taliban overnight Saturday in the Spin Buldak district of the southern Kandahar province of Afghanistan, leaving six Taliban killed .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-say-no-to-afghan-government-negotiators/story-KSbmtAptWrvVrJYjSLHTxJ.html
30-03-2020||World||‘US won’t pay for your protection’: Donald Trump to Prince Harry, Meghan||President Donald Trump said on Sunday that the United States would not pay for security protection for Britain’s Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, who, according to media reports, have settled in Los Angeles.Trump wrote on Twitter that “now they have left Canada for the U.S. however, the U.S. will not pay for their security protection. They must pay!” In January, the couple said they would step away from their royal duties.There is no indication that either Prince Harry or the British government has asked the U.S. government to cover security costs, which some media reports have said run to millions a year. The British Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Britain’s Sun newspaper reported last week the couple took a private flight to Los Angeles, but did not say when. Earlier this month, the United States and Canada agreed to close their border to non-essential travel at land crossings to ease the strain on health systems caused by the coronavirus.The couple had been living for several months with their son, Archie, on Vancouver Island in Canada.Meghan Markle was raised in the Los Angeles area and her mother, Doria, still lives there. Walt Disney Co said last week that Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, had narrated a nature documentary that will be released on its Disney+ streaming platform on Friday.Last month, Canada said it would no longer provide security once the couple were no longer working members of the British royal family.The Royal Canadian Mounted Police had been assisting London’s Metropolitan Police with security for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex “intermittently” since November, when the couple began a six-week vacation in Canada, Reuters reported in February.The couple stunned the royal family in early January with an announcement they would be stepping down from their roles as senior royals, in order to gain freedom from the intense media scrutiny that has followed them for several years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-us-will-not-pay-for-security-protection-for-prince-harry-meghan/story-OJIsV62T6SIWCfT0FC6nTJ.html

At least 33,000 people have died from the disease, with the US continuing to be the worst-hit country, followed by Italy, China, Spain and Germany.Struggling to cope with the outbreak, the Trump administration issued a travel advisory urging people of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, the worst-hit US states, to refrain from non-essential domestic travel for 14 days as the nationwide death toll crossed 2,000 - doubling in just two days.The travel advisory issued late on Saturday night by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was not the quarantine that US President Donald Trump had threatened earlier in the day, drawing furious response from governors, one of whom had called it a “declaration of war on states”.“Due to extensive community transmission of Covid-19 in the area, the CDC urges residents of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to refrain from non-essential domestic travel for 14 days effective immediately,” the CDC said in a statement, adding that governors of the states will have “full discretion” in enforcing the advisory. Essential services are exempted.Stay-at-home orders are already in force in all the three states with all non-essential services shut down and their workers sent home, with exemptions for trips to grocery stores, pharmacies and pick-up food orders.US cases climbed by well more than 21,000 over the previous day to at least 133,000 on Sunday. The death toll crossed 2,300. New York state remained the worst hit with the total number of cases crossing 59,000 and deaths going past 950.Spain moved to tighten its lockdown and ban all non-essential work on Sunday as it hit another daily record of 838 dead.

The death toll in Italy climbed by 756 to 10,779, the civil protection agency said on Sunday, the second successive fall in the daily rate. The number of fatalities, by far the highest of any country in the world, account for more than a third of all deaths from the infectious virus worldwide. The total number of confirmed cases in Italy rose on Sunday to 97,689 from a previous 92,472, the lowest daily rise in new cases since Wednesday. Lombardy, the hardest hit Italian region, reported a rise in deaths of around 416 on Sunday.Egypt shut its beaches as cases in the Mideast surpassed 50,000.

French politician Patrick Devedjian, 75, died from Covid-19, becoming France’s first death of a senior official.US deaths from the coronavirus could reach 200,000 with millions of cases, the government’s top infectious diseases expert warned on Sunday.Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, estimated in an interview with CNN that the pandemic could cause “between 100,000 and 200,000 deaths” in the US.Since 2010, the flu has killed between 12,000 and 61,000 Americans a year, according to the website of the CDC. The 1918-19 flu pandemic had killed 675,000 in America, according to the CDC website.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-update-worldwide-cases-hit-700-000-as-virus-torments-us-europe/story-M8GI4BdiPCu609V9eOu5JO.html
30-03-2020||World||Covid-19 update: China wary of second wave as imported coronavirus cases rise||The growing number of imported coronavirus cases in China risked fanning a second wave of infections at a time when “domestic transmission has basically been stopped”, a spokesman for the National Health Commission (NHC) said on Sunday.“China already has an accumulated total of 693 cases entering from overseas, which means the possibility of a new round of infections remains relatively big,” Mi Feng said.In the last seven days, China has reported 313 imported cases of coronavirus but only six confirmed cases of domestic transmission, the commission’s data showed. There were 45 new cases reported in the mainland on Saturday, down from 54 on the previous day. Most of those imported cases have involved Chinese returning home from abroad. Airlines have been ordered to sharply cut international flights from Sunday. And restrictions on foreigners entering the country went into effect on Saturday.Five more people died on Saturday, all of them in Wuhan, the industrial central city where the epidemic began in December. But Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, has reported only one new case on the last 10 days. A total of 3,300 people have now died in mainland China, with a reported 81,439 infections.Saturday marked the fourth consecutive day that Hubei province recorded no new confirmed cases. The sole local case was recorded in Henan province, bordering Hubei. With traffic restrictions in the province lifted, Wuhan is also gradually reopening borders and restarting some local transportation services.All airports in Hubei resumed some domestic flights on Sunday, with the exception of Wuhan’s Tianhe airport, which will open to domestic flights on April 8. Flights from Hubei to Beijing remain suspended. More than 60,000 people entered Wuhan on Saturday after rail services were officially restarted, with more than 260 trains arriving or travelling through, the People’s Daily reported. On Sunday, streets and metro trains were still largely empty. Wuhan Metro, which resumed operations on Saturday, said its cars would keep passenger capacity at less than 30%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-update-china-wary-of-second-wave-as-imported-coronavirus-cases-rise/story-q1NxOuvr8LWPHKwK4uyhcP.html

30-03-2020||World||Things will get worse before getting better, UK PM Boris warns||Prime Minister Boris Johnson has posted letters to 30 million households across the UK, cautioning people: “We know things will get worse before they get better”, as he continued to isolate himself in Downing Street after testing positive for coronavirus.Alongside the letter, residents will receive a leaflet outlining official advice, with clear explanations of symptoms, hand washing guidance, rules on leaving the house, self-isolating with symptoms and shielding vulnerable people. The UK death toll has reached 1,019.“The Prime Minister is continuing to lead the Government’s response to coronavirus as he self isolates after testing positive for the virus”, a spokesperson said. Health secretary Matt Hancock and Scotland secretary Alister Jack are among senior figures afflicted by the virus.Johnson says in the letter that the more Britons follow the rules, the fewer lives will be lost and the sooner life can return to normal. But health officials have not ruled out further restrictions during the ongoing three-week lockdown that may last until September.Johnson says: “It has been truly inspirational to see our doctors, nurses and other carers rise magnificently to the needs of the hour. Thousands of retired doctors and nurses are returning to the NHS – and hundreds of thousands of citizens are volunteering to help the most vulnerable.“That is why, at this moment of national emergency, I urge you, please, to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.”Former health secretary Jeremy Hunt called on Sunday for mass testing on the lines of that conducted in South Korea and Germany, so that the lockdown period could be shortened. His call was supported by former prime minister Tony Blair.Hunt wrote in The Sunday Telegraph that mass testing gave authorities greater clarity in identifying and containing potential outbreaks: “Where you find it, you can isolate and contain it. And where you don’t, vital services continue to function”.“With mass testing, accompanied by rigorous tracing of every person a Covid-19 patient has been in touch with, you can break the chain of transmission”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/things-will-get-worse-before-getting-better-uk-pm-boris-warns/story-OGhoOtBaasx5sPTh4s8qlK.html
