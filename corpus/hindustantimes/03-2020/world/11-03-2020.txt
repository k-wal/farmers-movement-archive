The health department will provide its daily update of the number of cases at 1800 GMT.The Irish Times newspaper reported that the elderly woman who died initially presented at a hospital in the east of the country with respiratory symptoms and was diagnosed with the disease when staff performed a test.“We continue our efforts to interrupt the transmission of this virus. It will take all of us, collectively to succeed,” Ireland’s chief medical officer, Tony Holohan, said in a statement.Two more cases were identified on Wednesday in Northern Ireland, the British region which shares an open border with the Irish republic, bringing the total there to 18, Northern Ireland’s health department said.The head of Ireland’s Health Service Executive, Paul Reid, also said on Wednesday that the country was entering a new phase in the spread of coronavirus and that he fully supported some hospitals that had decided to restrict visitors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ireland-reports-first-death-from-coronavirus-says-health-ministry/story-WooS6pgoLRriLnPU9LBChM.html

11-03-2020||World||China ready with rapid testing kits to detect coronavirus antibody in a patient||China is getting ready for the rapid screening of people for coronavirus if there’s a spike in cases as millions of people resume work across the country.Until now, China’s National Medical Products Administration has approved 10 new coronavirus nucleic acid detection reagents and 6 antibody detection reagents.As the number of new cases drops in China, the test kits if mass-produced could well be exported.Frontline doctors at the coronavirus epidemic epicentre of Wuhan are said to be using a 15-minute test kit to detect antibodies to the pathogen -- then go for a nucleic acid test for the final confirmation, which takes a few hours.The test kits helped them to check patients at a time when Wuhan’s medical facilities were flooded with suspected patients.The rapid test kit was developed in the city of Wuxi, eastern China’s Jiangsu province by scientists from the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention and a company based in Wuxi city, a state media report said.“The kit can detect the virus within eight to 15 minutes”, the city’s bureau of science and technology told state media.The kit was deployed in Wuhan because it had “high sensitivity and is easy to use and transport”.The company had then said it could produce kits for 4,000 people a day, and the city government was helping the company expand production.The first batch of the kits was used in Wuhan in early February.Several institutes and companies in China are continuing research on developing rapid testing kits, possibly with the idea of exporting the kits as the outbreak surges globally.On March 7, another rapid testing kit to detect covid-19 antibody with results available in 29 minutes was approved by China’s National Medical Products Administration.This kit was developed by a research team led by experts from Xiamen University. “The kit can be used for clinical cases, suspected cases and the screening of high-risk groups, improving the testing efficiency of front-line medical institutions,” official news agency, Xinhua reported last week.According to state media, the kit was going through clinical trials in hospitals in Wuhan.“The combination of nucleic acid tests and antibody detection has improved the detection rate. According to the developer, three antibody reagents for covid-19 have been approved by the European Union and exported to countries including Italy, Austria and the Netherland,” the state media report said.On Wednesday, a group of Chinese medical scientists said they have developed yet another rapid antibody test that can diagnose the coronavirus within 15 minutes by testing a drop of blood from fingertips.Led by Chinese top medical expert Zhong Nanshan, who is heading the Chinese government’s anti-epidemic task force, the team said that the antibody test aims to offer an accurate and rapid method to quickly identify infected patients and asymptomatic carriers of the novel coronavirus.According to the tabloid, Global Times, clinical studies of the new test kit have been carried out in eight clinical sites across the country, which validated the clinical detection sensitivity, specificity and clinical efficacy of the new test kit. “Compared with the nucleic acid RT‐PCR test (to detect and measure RNA), which takes 3-4 hours to produce results, the new kit can detect the antibodies against the virus in human blood within 15 minutes with an overall testing the sensitivity of 88.66 percent and specificity of 90.63 percent,” the GT report said. The report added that in addition, the team found that the clinical diagnosis results obtained from finger blood, serum and plasma of venous blood indicated great detection consistency, which means there will be a more convenient test method in the future by only testing the finger blood of a suspected patient.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-ready-with-rapid-testing-kits-to-detect-coronavirus-antibody-in-a-patient/story-6RetP4dRgDDyB5I1Qi0XoJ.html

We will form a four-member probe team and it will be asked to submit its report within 10 days,” Rahman was quoted as saying by the Dhaka Tribune.He said the narrow lanes around the slum and shortage of water had caused difficulty for about 20 fire fighting units in putting out the blaze.Hundreds of low-income residents of the slum lost their belongings and shelters as the fire burnt them to ashes, Rahman said.Local lawmaker Elias Uddin Mollah told reporters that some 20,000 people lived in 2,000 shanties in the Shialbari Jhilpar Slum.Mollah, who was at the scene of the blaze, said the residents affected by the fire will temporarily be lodged in a school nearby.“No one will be living under the open sky. We will stand by them until their homes become habitable. We will bear all the expenses relating to their food, shelter and clothing,” he told bdnews24.com.“The area shelters hundreds of thousands of poor residents,” Officer-in-Charge of Rupnagar Police Station Abul Kalam Azad told The Daily Star newspaper.According to slum dwellers and fire officials, illegal gas and electricity connections in the slum caused the fire.There was no natural source of water like pond or canal in the area which resulted in delay in dousing the blaze, an official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/massive-fire-engulfs-slum-in-bangladesh-thousands-left-homeless-report/story-0v8APfzGYudR0qVb1vIKHL.html

Some saw Sunak’s confident performance peppered with some jokes as a ‘leadership audition.’Opening the speech with measures to deal with the virus, Sunak said: “I know how worried people are... what everyone needs to know is we are doing everything we can to keep this country and our people healthy and financially secure. This is an issue above party.”Sunak abolished ‘tampon tax’ on women’s sanitary products and allocated billions of pounds to infrastructure and various sectors, indicating the end of decade-long austerity initiated by the David Cameron-led coalition government in 2010, marked by deep funding cuts.The budget announcement was preceded by the Bank of England cutting interest rates in an emergency move to bolster the economy during the coronavirus outbreak, from 0.75 per cent to 0.25 per cent, amounting to a historic low.Bank of England governor Mark Carney said: “This is a big package. It is a big deal. It will have real economic effects, but also acting across the world and in a coordinated manner with the government in a way that makes it clear that we are going to bridge a situation, as opposed to allowing it to be turned into something worse.”Besides incentives to the high export revenue earning Scotch whisky industry, Sunak’s populist announcements included cancelling a planned rise in beer duty and freezing duties for cider and wine. Business rate discount for pubs this year will be £5,000, up from £1,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rishi-sunak-gives-30-billion-to-tackle-coronavirus-in-upbeat-uk-budget/story-4E0XFCV1OqhTRyjR0IXDyM.html

Officials quickly unveiled a battery of measures to contain the outbreak, closing schools in Madrid for two weeks, disinfecting public transport daily in the capital and banning all incoming flights from Italy. But Simon said the impact of such measures would only be known “after nine or 10 days”.He said it would take “between one and two months” to end the epidemic, which in the worst-case scenario could be up to “four months”. The government has also promised to help the tourism sector in the world’s number two tourist destination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spain-reports-over-2-000-coronavirus-cases-total-death-toll-at-47/story-zER1pGwCtqfoD8MsvUCloL.html
11-03-2020||World||Turkish President Erdogan vows strong military action if Syria truce violated||Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan vowed on Wednesday that his military would launch its harshest retaliation yet if the Syrian government breaks a fragile truce in Idlib province brokered last week.The cease-fire arranged by Turkey and Russia — which support opposing sides in the conflict — halted a three-month air and ground campaign by the Syrian government against the rebel-held province. That offensive killed hundreds and sent 1 million people fleeing toward the Turkish border.The Russian-backed Syrian government offensive made significant gains in Syria’s last rebel stronghold, and Turkey sent thousands of troops across the border to reinforce the rebels, leading to rare direct fighting between Syrian and Turkish troops.“If those across from us don’t keep their promise, we will never shy away from advancing on them in a much more serious way than before,” Erdogan said in his weekly address to his ruling party’s legislators.Erdogan said there had been a number of small violations of the truce, which Turkey was monitoring carefully.He said Turkey’s priority would be the security of its troops manning a dozen observation posts inside Idlib. Some of those posts now fall within Syrian government-controlled territory. The posts are in place as part of a previous cease-fire agreement reached in 2018.“The security of our observation posts is at the top of our priorities. In the event of the smallest attack there, we not only will retaliate, we will reciprocate more heavily,” Erdogan said.Erdogan added that Turkey was engaged in efforts to turn the cease-fire into a more lasting truce.“We fought the necessary fight, and as a result signed a temporary ceasefire in Moscow. Now the issue is to transform this temporary cease-fire into a permanent one and we are swiftly pursuing that,” he said.Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar told reporters that talks with a Russian delegation about the technicalities of the truce were progressing in a “positive and constructive” manner. The delegation arrived Tuesday.The current deal sets up a security corridor along Syria’s M4 highway, running east-west in Idlib. Russian and Turkish troops are scheduled to begin joint patrols along the M4 on March 15.The cease-fire deal also appeared to achieve Moscow’s key goal of allowing the Syrian government to keep hold of the strategic north-south highway known as the M5. Syrian forces had captured its last segments in the latest offensive, which began in early December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkish-president-erdogan-vows-strong-military-action-if-syria-truce-violated/story-BJUZQReLycIJ3i0zVojvyO.html
11-03-2020||World||Pope Francis livestreams general audience as coronavirus puts Vatican City on lockdown||Pope Francis held his weekly general audience in the privacy of his library Wednesday as the Vatican implemented Italy’s drastic virus lockdown measures.Police barred the general public from St. Peter’s Square and the Vatican took measures to limit infections inside the city state and mitigate the economic fallout outside.Francis sent out special prayers for prisoners, the sick and hospital personnel caring for them, delivering his weekly catechism lesson via livestream rather than in person. The scene was somewhat surreal given the whole point of a general audience — a tradition that dates to the time of St. John XXIII — was to bring the pope into contact with ordinary folk at least once a week.And under normal circumstances, the Wednesday appointment brings tens of thousands of people into St. Peter’s Square or the Vatican auditorium for an hour-long catechism lesson delivered in a variety of languages. But on Wednesday, the square was empty and police barred access to St. Peter’s Basilica to anyone but individuals seeking to pray.For most, the coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. But for a few, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illnesses, including pneumonia. More than 119,000 people have been infected worldwide and over 4,200 have died.Italy is the European epicenter of the outbreak, with more than 10,000 positive cases. With 631 dead, Italy’s fatality rate is running at more than 6% — far higher than other countries. Officials attribute the high toll to Italy’s aged population, the second-oldest in the world outside Japan.The Vatican, a 108-acre (nearly 45-hectare) city-state in the heart of Rome, has taken Italy’s lead and imposed drastic measures to contain the virus after one person in Vatican City was infected, another who attended a Vatican conference tested positive and five people were placed on precautionary quarantine. At 83 and with part of a lung removed during a respiratory illness when he was a young man, Francis would be at high risk for complications were he to get the virus.The Vatican has canceled meetings and conferences, limited travel among its personnel and closed the Vatican Museums to the public — essentially closing off its main source of income for the foreseeable future. On Wednesday came the predicted cancellation of Francis’ rumored trip to Indonesia, East Timor and Papua New Guinea later this year.The Vatican this week also made moves to try to mitigate the dramatic economic impact on Italy’s businesses because of the sharp dropoff in commercial, retail and tourism industries. The Vatican is one of the biggest landlords in Rome, and on Tuesday offered to entertain rent reductions from businesses experiencing problems.During the audience, the pope was surrounded by a handful of priest translators sitting a meter (about three feet) apart in his private library. At the end, Francis directed a final prayer to the sick and those who are caring for them.“I thank to my heart the hospital personnel, the doctors nurses and volunteers. In this difficult moment, they are close to those who are suffering.”Earlier, during his morning Mass — celebrated privately but livestreamed — the pope prayed especially for prisoners, after more than two dozen riots broke out in lock-ups across Italy in recent days as inmates protested virus containment measures and agitated to be allowed out to prevent infections.“Today, I would like to pray especially for the inmates, our brothers and our sisters in jail,” he said. “They suffer so we need to be close to them with prayers so that the Lord may help them and comfort them in this difficult moment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-francis-livestreams-general-audience-as-coronavirus-puts-vatican-city-on-lockdown/story-l7YDI7TA8r2NWEW4FnmVBO.html
11-03-2020||World||Turkey confirms first coronavirus case; wins WHO praise for vigilance||Turkey confirmed its first case of the coronavirus on Wednesday, becoming the last major economy to report an outbreak after taking what the World Health Organization (WHO) described as “vigilant, cautious” measures to delay the disease.Turkey’s tourism sector, which accounts for about 13% of its economy, stepped up calls on the government for financial help to deal with the expected negative impact of the outbreak.Health Minister Fahrettin Koca confirmed early on Wednesday that a Turkish man with a high fever and cough had been diagnosed as having the virus and had been isolated.“This is the first case confirmed in our country. The findings show the diagnosis of coronavirus was made early and if the virus has spread it is limited,” he told a news conference.“Our country is prepared for this, all measures to prevent the spread (of the virus) have been taken,” he said, referring to comprehensive screening and testing programmes. Until the announcement, Turkey - a member of the Group of 20 biggest global economies and a major transit hub between Europe, Asia and Africa - had officially managed to avoid an outbreak, though all its neighbours except war-ravaged Syria had reported cases. Iran has an especially high number of cases.In an interview hours before the announcement of the first case, Irshad Shaikh, the WHO Health Security Program Leader in Turkey, praised Ankara’s preventative measures and good organisation, saying it had been “very lucky, vigilant and cautious”.GEARING UP FOR BATTLEThe WHO has given guidance globally, and is in contact with health officials in Turkey on legislation, risk management, testing and screening practices, among other issues, he said. “In all those areas...Turkey has taken that to heart.”“Turkey is an advanced country, and most of the systems were already there. What was needed was to make sure they are quick to this outbreak,” Shaikh told Reuters.Turkish Tourism Minister Mehmet Nuri Ersoy and tourism officials met in Ankara just before the first case was announced to discuss possible repercussions of the outbreak.The Tourism Evaluation Council said it suggested financial support for tour operators and airlines, reductions in utilities costs, and measures to increase bookings. The sector is “starting to be negatively impacted”, it added. Ankara has said that all 81 of its provinces are geared up to handle a potential outbreak and that it has set up seven test centres across the country.Turkey says it has developed its own testing kit, which it is also exporting to other countries, to get faster results.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkey-confirms-first-coronavirus-case-wins-who-praise-for-vigilance/story-nEGiPifsZQAjpZtyZSasrN.html

Pakistan saw a sudden increase in coronavirus infections on Tuesday when a dozen new cases were reported across the country. The health ministry official said that the latest case was reported from Skardu district. The patient, who recently returned from Iran with his mother, showed symptoms of the virus and was immediately placed in quarantine with his family members, said Shah Zaman, a doctor. He said the boy and his mother had arrived from Iran on February 25. On Tuesday night, the first coronavirus case of Baluchistan was also confirmed in a 12-year-old boy. The patient has recently travelled to Iran, said Noorullah Musakhail, the medical superintendent at Fatima Jinnah Hospital in Quetta. The patients belongs to Sindh’s Dadu district. Sindh has reported the highest number of COVID-9 cases in Pakistan. Six traffic controllers, who worked at a Karachi airport, have been placed in quarantine after they were suspected of having contracted the novel coronavirus, Civil Aviation Authority spokesperson Abdus Sattar Khokhar said in a statement. The suspected patients were posted at Jinnah International Airport in Karachi and have been isolated as per the standard operating procedure, Khokhar said. He said the directions had been given to screen all staff members of air traffic control posted in Karachi for any symptoms of COVID19. The total number of cases of the virus in Sindh have now reached 15 while one case was also reported from Hyderabad. The patient in Hyderabad had visited Syria and returned home via Doha. Special Assistant to Prime Minister on Health Zafar Mirza has said that the nine coronavirus cases confirmed on Monday evening were in a “stable clinical condition”. In a tweet, he added: “almost all of them are asymptotic”. “They all had travel history and were picked up during contact tracing of an existing COVID19 patient,” Mirza said. So far, no coronavirus related death has been reported in Pakistan. One of the COVID-19 patients in Karachi has recovered and was allowed to go home on Saturday. The deadly virus that first originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December last year has claimed over 4,200 lives and infected more than 117,330 people across 107 countries and territories. China remains the hardest-hit with more than 80,000 infections and 3,000 deaths. The World Health Organisation raised the global virus risk to maximum level after the outbreak spread to sub-Saharan Africa and stock markets around the world plummeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-cases-rise-to-20-in-pakistan/story-PsmPEG7NE5DoNXLfh5urkJ.html

11-03-2020||World||Wuhan told to go back to work as new cases of coronavirus subsides in China||Some vital industries in Wuhan, the Chinese city at the epicentre of the coronavirus epidemic, were told they can resume work on Wednesday, a day after President Xi Jinping visited there for the first time since the outbreak began.The city of 11 million has been in lockdown since late January but Xi’s visit signalled the tide was turning in the government’s favour as it fights to contain a virus that as of Tuesday had infected 80,778 people in China and killed 3,158.Authorities elsewhere in China lowered emergency response levels to the epidemic and relaxed travel restrictions.Drawing confidence from Xi’s visit and falling new infections, the Hubei provincial government said public transport workers in Wuhan and those engaged in making medical supplies and producing daily necessities would be allowed to return to work.Other industries that impact national or global supply chains can also return to work with permission from relevant authorities, it said.Wuhan accounts for nearly 10% of vehicles made in China and is home to hundreds of parts suppliers. Across the country, manufacturing is slowly returning to normal. Though the economy is still operating at about 25% below its usual levels, activity should be fully restored by the end of April, Francoise Huang, senior economist at Euler Hermes, predicted in a note to clients.On Wednesday, Japanese automaker Nissan said it planned to partially resume production at two Chinese plants, one of them in Hubei. Its competitor Honda said that some employees had returned to work at its plant in Wuhan, and that it would gradually restart production from Wednesday.In a gesture to further boost investor confidence, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said on Wednesday it will actively help foreign-invested firms resume work and expand sectors in which foreign investment in encouraged.While relaxing some restrictions, the Hubei government said curbs on transport in Wuhan would remain in place, and schools in the province would remain closed until further notice.The city of Qianjiang in Hubei also bucked a wider loosening trend, with authorities saying they would retain strict transport bans.Latest figures from the National Health Commission showed 24 new coronavirus cases nationwide, and 22 more deaths as of Tuesday. All the latest deaths occurred in Wuhan.But new infections in Hubei continued to stabilise, with new cases declining for the sixth day. All 13 new cases in Hubei were recorded in Wuhan.IMPORTED CASESThe most encouraging trend to be taken from the latest infection figures was lower rate of transmission within communities in China, as 10 of Tuesday’s 24 new cases involved people travelling from abroad.But Chinese customs said downward pressure on China’s foreign trade and the global economy is still increasing as the coronavirus epidemic is spreading quickly abroad.“Stabilising trade growth would be more difficult,” Customs said in a statement. “Risks of imported cases are suddenly rising, and dealing with coronavirus-related risks at China’s ports would pose a major challenge.”While only 79 of the cases in China have come from abroad, the rising number of such incidences has prompted authorities to shift their focus on containing the risk of imported cases. The capital of Beijing saw six new cases on Tuesday involving individuals who travelled from Italy and the United States, while Shanghai had two imported infections, Shandong province one and Gansu province one. The southern province of Guangdong reported three cases involving travellers, one from France and two from Spain.Elsewhere, however, Hunan province and the municipality of Chongqing lowered their emergency response level, while cities around Shandong province resumed inter-city and rural passenger transportation routes, the official Xinhua news agency reported. So far, about three-quarters of China’s municipalities, regions and provinces have lowered their emergency response level from the highest tier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wuhan-told-to-go-back-to-work-as-new-cases-of-coronavirus-subsides-in-china/story-lBHdEuUB3TGAJ1NLL16ZOJ.html

Despite reporting over 7,000 cases, South Korea has succeeded in cutting down the number of infections and has reported one of the lowest coronavirus fatality rates in the world.Here’s what India and other countries can learn from Moon-Jae-in’s leadership in tackling the coronavirus epidemic. 1. The South Korean authorities vigorously trace down the contacts of all those who tested positive for the virus. 2. The infected individuals would also be traced back to at least 14 days to understand the possible spread of the virus. The process would even include tracking credit card use, CCTV footage and mobile phone activity. 3. South Korea has been able to conduct a large number of diagnostic tests at a fast pace - an average of over 10,000 tests a day, reports news agency AFP. 4. The country has over 500 testing labs.5. Just within weeks of coronavirus outbreak being reported in China, South Korea got newly-developed COVID-19 testing kits approved from the government for clinics across the nation.

The number of coronavirus cases in the country is fourth highest in the world - after China, Italy and Iran - but with just 60 deaths, its coronavirus fatality rate falls well below the World Health Organisation’s global average.Masahiro Kami, head of the Tokyo-based Medical Governance Research Institute, told news agency AFP, “Testing is a crucial initial step to control the virus,” Kami said, adding: “It’s a good model for every country.”Marylouise McLaws, epidemiologist and advisor to the World Health Organisation, said South Korea had “gone in hard and fast”, as opposed to Italy where she said the outbreak could have taken a different course if containment measures had been imposed earlier.Also read: All individuals need not be screened for Covid-19 - Health Ministry Italy, on the other hand, is being seen as the super spreader of coronavirus after China.

External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Wednesday said that situation in coronavirus hotspot Italy is now emerging as a “cause of great concern”.“The steps in this regard have already been initiated. The challenge is growing by the day in Europe and we have to respond accordingly,” Jaishankar told the Rajya Sabha, adding that the government is ready to tackle the coronavirus challenge.(With inputs from AFP)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tackling-coronavirus-5-ways-south-korea-sets-an-example/story-BDjUD4Bf6l5UJuMP4vLMCN.html

Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri said Italy will immediately use “half of these resources” and keep the other half in reserve.Italy unveiled a 7.5-billion-euro emergency response package last Thursday that officials later said would likely have to be increased to match the rapid rise in new infections and deaths.A top economy minister had said on Tuesday that the package could reach 10 billion euros.Italy, whose faltering economy is the third largest in the eurozone, needs special EU permission to spend more than allowed under the bloc’s strict budget rules for its 27 member states.EU leaders had said they would accept Italy’s request when it still stood at 7.5 billion euros.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-announces-25-billion-euros-package-to-fight-coronavirus/story-NRx3mm7cCONVDddG9MJZrK.html

11-03-2020||World||Russia passes bill allowing Vladimir Putin to stay in power for next 12 years||The Russian parliament approved a sweeping constitutional reform in the third and final reading Wednesday, a move that will allow President Vladimir Putin to stay in power for another 12 years after his current term ends in 2024.The Kremlin-controlled lower house, the State Duma, endorsed a set of amendments to the constitution and a provision resetting the term count for Putin after the revised constitution goes into force by a 383-0 vote with 43 abstentions. A nationwide vote on the proposed amendments is set for April 22.Kremlin critics condemned the move as a cynical manipulation and called for protests.Putin, a 67-year-old former KGB officer, has ruled Russia for more than 20 years. After serving for two consecutive four-year terms — a limit outlined in the current version of the constitution — Putin shifted to prime minister’s seat in 2008, with his close ally Dmitry Medvedev becoming a placeholder president.The length of the presidency was extended to six years under Medvedev, and in 2012 Putin returned to the Kremlin as president. In 2018, he was re-elected for another six years.The constitutional reform passed by the Duma on Wednesday would allow Putin to run for presidency two more times after 2024. Ahead of the national vote, it will be reviewed by Russia’s Constitutional Court.The changes redistribute the executive powers of the Russian government in Moscow and further strengthen the power of the presidency, while also banning same-sex marriage and listing “a belief in God” as one of Russia’s traditional values.The proposal to restart the term clock for the current president was put forward by 83-year-old former Soviet cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova, now a Duma deputy, during the second reading of the amendments on Tuesday. Following Tereshkova’s speech, Putin quickly arrived at parliament to address the lawmakers and supported the idea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-passes-bill-allowing-vladimir-putin-to-stay-in-power-for-next-12-years/story-dxddVI9BNXTHv24iksFv9M.html
11-03-2020||World||After 2003 assault, UK to probe 2018 death of Indian-origin man as murder||Seventeen years after an Indian-origin man was brutally attacked in London and nearly two years after his death, Scotland Yard on Tuesday announced that the incident is now being treated as a murder investigation.Rajesh Verma, who was 42 at the time, was assaulted in Acton Park by a group of men on August 31, 2003, resulting in severe brain damage. He died on May 27, 2018. A special post mortem in June 2018 concluded there was a causal link between the 2003 assault and his death.A verdict of unlawful killing was recorded at an inquest held at West London Coroners Court on November 28, 2019. A full police investigation was carried out in 2003, but no suspect was arrested or charged.The police said the case has now be classified as a murder investigation and enquiries are being carried out by homicide detectives. A £20,000 reward is being offered for any information that leads to the arrest and conviction of Verma’s killer.Detective chief inspector Noel McHugh said: “The attack on Rajesh involved ferocious violence by a group of men, one of whom, stabbed him in the head with a set of garden shears found near the crime scene”.“We believe Rajesh was attacked after he intervened in a dispute between one of his friends and another individual. The suspects are believed to be local to the Acton area and are likely to still be living there or have links to the area. All were described as being of East African appearance”.“This is a shocking crime and I’m in no doubt that people will have chatted and boasted about it. I need your call to identify Rajesh’s killer and that’s why we are offering a reward of £20,000 for information leading to the arrest and prosecution of those responsible”.After the 2003 attack, Verma was treated at hospital before being discharged. However, he was left with a number of ongoing health issues due to the damage caused to his brain by the stab wound to his head.In 2015, he had a major heart attack, which resulted in a lack of oxygen to his brain that further complicated the existing damage. This rendered him unresponsive and unable to move or speak for the last 18 months of his life.Verma’s wife, Roma Verma, said the aftermath of the attack had a huge impact on the family: “Our children were 11 and 13 when their lives were turned upside down. We chose to care for him at home in the way that he had cared for all of us”.“Each member of the family helped to care for him. He was unable to think, move, talk or walk, but we still felt he could feel our presence and persevered. He required 24-hour assistance and we gave it. We watched him in the same position day after day. Life was all about him, but we all had hope.“The assault 15 years before, was random and unexpected. His assault left a huge gap in our hearts and continues to do so. His generosity and love for fellow humans did not deserve this. He was protective of the family but also of the vulnerable”.“He was a very popular man in Acton. Hundreds paid their respects at his funeral. There were friends and family but also homeless people, and local business people who he had helped tirelessly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-2003-assault-uk-to-probe-2018-death-of-indian-origin-man-as-murder/story-ayYSXjD9yEnoNQJQLWORWI.html
11-03-2020||World||Key firms in Wuhan allowed to resume work as number of new coronavirus cases fall||China announced Wednesday that key companies will be allowed to resume work in coronavirus-hit Wuhan, in another sign authorities are confident the quarantined city is winning its battle against the epidemic.The decision came a day after President Xi Jinping paid his first visit to the capital of Hubei province since it was placed under lockdown in late January after the outbreak became a national emergency.The number of daily new cases has fallen steadily in Wuhan in recent weeks, while all other cities in Hubei have reported zero fresh infections for several days in a row -- prompting Xi to declare that the spread of the virus has been “basically curbed” in the province.The Hubei provincial government said Wednesday that Wuhan businesses involved in providing daily necessities, prevention and control of the epidemic, or in the operations of public utilities, are among those that can resume work and production immediately.Wuhan firms that are key to “global industrial chains” may do so as well, after getting approval, the government added.Other companies are expected to resume production only after March 20.Similar rules apply to areas outside Wuhan that are considered high-risk, where companies involved in epidemic prevention, public utilities and providing necessities are among those that may resume work.In areas considered medium or low risk, there is a broader range of companies allowed to return to work.Passenger flights, trains, cars, ships and city buses in middle- and low-risk areas -- moving within the province and excluding Wuhan -- will “gradually resume operations” as well, although no timeframe was given.But authorities said they will continue strict control measures on channels out of Wuhan and Hubei.Health codes The announcement came a day after Hubei authorities loosened travel restrictions, allowing people from medium and low risk areas to move within the province if their health code is labelled “green”.A mobile app will be used to give residents a coloured health code. Green indicates holders have no contact with virus cases, while those with yellow codes are close contacts.Confirmed or suspected cases will get a red code, and must be quarantined.Authorities added in the latest statement on Wednesday that outside of Wuhan, a “point-to-point” system will be adopted to send employees back to work, and help those stranded in Hubei to return home.Schools will continue to be suspended in Hubei.Wuhan city has been on lockdown since January 23 as China scrambled to contain the spread of the deadly coronavirus, which has now killed over 3,100 and infected nearly 81,000 in the country.Other cities in Hubei soon followed suit, placing a total of around 56 million people under quarantine.Most of China’s cases and deaths came from Hubei, with the majority in Wuhan.But with cases falling dramatically in the province, residents have been clamouring for restrictions to be eased.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/key-firms-in-wuhan-allowed-to-resume-work-as-number-of-new-coronavirus-cases-fall/story-kagD2hIsqp9j2ZcMvnBfAK.html
11-03-2020||World||Afghans set to release 1,500 Taliban prisoners; US wants less violence||After a series of delays, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani issued a decree early Wednesday promising to release 1,500 Taliban prisoners as a goodwill gesture to get intra-Afghan negotiations started, even though a deal signed by the United States and the Taliban calls for the release of up to 5,000 prisoners ahead of the much sought-after negotiations.There was no official response from the Taliban, but The Associated Press saw a letter that Mullah Nooruddin Turabi, the head of the Taliban’s Prisoners Commission, sent to the prisoners, their families and Taliban leaders promising there would be no intra-Afghan talks until all the prisoners are released.The Pashto-language letter was sent last weekend. It says the Taliban would verify that each prisoner released is among those on the list given to an American delegation.However, the presidential decree went on to say the first round of 1,500 prisoners will be selected based on age, health and the length of their sentences already served. The released prisoners, who will be biometrically identified, will also have to give a written guarantee that they will not return to the battlefield.The remaining 3,500 prisoners will be released after intra-Afghan negotiations begin and 500 will be released every two weeks providing the Taliban reduce violence on the battlefield, Ghani’s decree said.However, even if the Taliban agree to start negotiations, Kabul’s political turmoil and relentless bickering between Ghani and his main rival, Abdulllah Abdullah, who has also sworn himself in as Afghanistan’s president, have left Kabul struggling to come up with a united negotiating team.Ghani’s decree came as the U.S. State Department issued a statement saying that the level of violence is “unacceptable,” and that while the Taliban have stopped attacks against the U.S.-led coalition forces and in Afghan cities, the violence in the countryside remains too high.The statement also said Afghanistan’s “presidential electoral crisis” — an apparent reference to the two inaugurations and political chaos — has delayed the establishment of a national negotiating team and the start of intra-Afghan talks, which were to begin on Tuesday in Oslo, Norway.Despite the political chaos in Kabul and increased violence on the battlefield, the United States has started withdrawing its troops in keeping with the deal it signed on Feb. 29 with the Taliban. In the first phase, Washington will reduce its troops contingent to 8,600, down from the current 13,000.If the Taliban adhere to their commitments to deny terrorists safe havens in Afghanistan, Washington will withdraw the remainder of its troops over 14 months, according to the agreement.When it was signed, the U.S.-Taliban deal was touted as Afghanistan’s best chance at finding peace after 40 years of relentless war while offering the United States an exit after nearly 19 years and its longest war.President Donald Trump has expressed increasing frustration with the Afghan government and its security forces’ inability to police and manage their own affairs. But almost from the beginning the unraveling began as the Taliban returned to the battlefield and Afghanistan’s politicians stepped up their feuding as Washington’s Special Envoy Zalmay Khalilzad scrambled to find a way out of the impasse.In the end, both Ghani and Abdullah declared themselves president. The United States and other international players attended Ghani’s ceremony while urging both men to negotiate a single government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghans-set-to-release-1-500-taliban-prisoners-us-wants-less-violence/story-urYynQ92LOinIVMeCmERTL.html

Online instruction there will last until at least April 5.Stanford University, located in California’s Santa Clara County, which currently has dozens of confirmed cases of the coronavirus, cancelled all in-person classes for the final two weeks of its winter semester.The Ohio State University also suspended in-person classes through at least March 30.The virus - which originated in Wuhan, China, last year - has spread to more than 110 countries, areas or territories worldwide and infected over 100,000. More than 4,000 have died as a result of the virus.For most people, the infectious respiratory disease causes only mild or moderate symptoms such as fever and cough and the infected recover within weeks.For others, especially older adults and people with health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-varsities-suspend-regular-classes-switch-to-online-teaching-amid-coronavirus-scare/story-k454WTHlrz8hs49hfG7xXI.html

11-03-2020||World||UN Security Council endorses US-Taliban peace deal||The UN Security Council has unanimously adopted a resolution welcoming the recent deal between the US and the Taliban to bring lasting peace in war-torn Afghanistan and allow US troops to return home from America’s longest war.The US-Taliban peace deal was signed in Doha on February 29. All 15 members of the UNSC on Tuesday supported the resolution, tabled by the United States, which endorses the joint US-Afghan declaration on peace and the agreement signed between Washington and the Taliban.“The developments endorsed by this resolution are the product of more than a year of unprecedented US diplomatic engagement with the Taliban, in coordination with our partners in Afghanistan, the region, and around the world,” Acting Deputy Permanent Representative of the US to UN Cherith Norman Chalet said.The agreement with the Taliban calls for the fundamentalists to sever ties with international terrorist groups and to prevent them from using Afghanistan to carry out attacks against the US.Under the terms of the deal, the Taliban would also participate in an intra-Afghan dialogue. While negotiations were scheduled to begin on Tuesday, they were postponed due to renewed violence and political discord at the highest levels of the government. Afghanistan’s rival leaders -- incumbent President Ashraf Ghani and his former unity government partner Abdullah Abdullah -- claimed victory in the presidential election held last September and each sworn in as the country’s new president in separate ceremonies on Monday, throwing plans for talks with the Taliban into chaos The US has welcomed President Ghani’s steps towards agreement on an inclusive government, and Abdullah’s commitments to peace and inclusivity.“We hope the people of Afghanistan seize the opportunity to achieve a historic peace settlement that ends the conflict in Afghanistan; preserves the gains of the last two decades in human rights, basic freedoms, and the meaningful participation of women in political and civil institutions; and ensures that the territory of the Afghan people will never again be used by international terrorists to threaten the world,” Norman Chalet said.The Security Council vote took place just hours after the Group of Friends of Women in Afghanistan met at the UN headquarters. The group, founded last year by the Afghan Mission to the UN, champion women’s participation in the country’s future. It is co-chaired by the UK and comprised of women representatives to the UN and its senior officials.Group co-chair Ambassador Karen Pierce of the United Kingdom said the UN resolution sends a clear message on women’s inclusion in Afghanistan’s future.“We expect to see the effective and meaningful participation in the peace process of women, as well as youth and other minorities. And while any peace deal is ultimately for Afghans to decide upon, we affirm that it should protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of all,” she said.Prior to voting, Council members observed a minute of silence in honour of former UN Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, who died last week at the age of 100. The Peruvian diplomat was the UN’s fifth Secretary-General and served two terms: from 1982 to 1991.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-security-council-endorses-us-taliban-peace-deal/story-ulblTAw3J0jEb4RjyTI1YI.html
11-03-2020||World||Ex-vice president Joe Biden wins Michigan, Mississippi and Missouri primaries||Former vice-president Joe Biden expanded his lead over Senator Bernie Sanders with projected victories in three of the six states that held their Democratic presidential nominating contests Tuesday, including the prize catch of the evening, Michigan, a key state rich in delegates needed to win the race.Biden also picked up Mississippi and Missouri, continuing his winning spree from the South Carolina primaries. He had gone on to win 10 of the 14 states that polled in the Super Tuesday contests last week in a stunning reversal of fortunes, resurrecting his campaign that had been given up for dead.Washington state, Idaho and North Dakota, the other three states that went to polls Tuesday, had not been called yet.Biden struck a conciliatory tone in a victory speech from Philadelphia. “I want to thank Bernie Sanders and his supporters for their tireless passion,” he said, with his wife, the former second lady Jill Biden, by his side. “We share a common goal and together we’ll defeat Donald Trump.”Sanders uncharacteristically made no remarks.The Tuesday results may not have sealed the race for Biden, but they certainly made Sanders’s path to the nomination improbable because of the widening gap between him and the former vice-president in their tally of delegates to reach the finishing line with 1,991 — Biden leads Sanders 724-591. Sanders had won four of these six states in the 2016 primaries against Hillary Clinton, including Michigan. And his chances look bleak in the next four states that hold their nominating contests next Tuesday, that are expected, instead, to put Biden even further out his reach.Some Democrats don’t see a path for Sanders to the nomination at all after the Tuesday results and are calling for the primaries to be shut down. Jim Clyburn, the South Carolina Democrat whose endorsement is widely seen to have turned around the race for Biden, told NPR, “I think when the night is over, Joe Biden will be the prohibitive favorite to win the Democratic nomination, and quite frankly, if the night ends the way it has begun, I think it is time for us to shut this primary down, it is time for us to cancel the rest of these debates.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ex-vice-president-joe-biden-expands-lead-over-bernie-sanders-with-tuesday-wins/story-EwVy5DWwfSQLLd7XY3CFPL.html
11-03-2020||World||China reports 22 new coronavirus deaths, President Xi makes first visit to epicentre Wuhan||China has reported 22 new coronavirus deaths, taking the death toll to 3,158, health officials said on Wednesday, as Chinese President Xi Jinping made his first visit to the worst-hit Wuhan city and lauded the authorities and medical staff for “turning the tide” against the deadly epidemic, saying that the initial success has been made in stabilising the situation.Twenty-four new confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus and 22 deaths have been reported on the Chinese mainland on Tuesday, China’s National Health Commission (NHC) said on Wednesday.All the 22 deaths were in Hubei Province and its capital Wuhan, the NHC said.The overall confirmed cases on the mainland reached 80,778 by the end of Tuesday, including 3,158 people who died of the disease in the last three months, 16,145 patients undergoing treatment and 61,475 discharged after recovery, it said.Meanwhile, 31 new suspected cases were reported taking the total number to 285, it said.With COVID-19 gradually abating in the country, China has now turned its attention to growing number of “imported cases” as more foreigners and locals started arriving in Beijing and different cities to join duties.Also on Tuesday, 10 imported cases of novel coronavirus infection were reported on the mainland. Among them, six were reported in Beijing, two in Shanghai, one in Shandong Province and one in Gansu Province. By the end of Tuesday, 79 imported cases had been reported, the officials said.Xi, 66, on Tuesday made his first visit to Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus, which along with the entire Hubei province with over 50 million people was kept under total lockdown since January 23, banning all movement of transportation.The president visited a hospital treating severely ill COVID-19 patients and a residential community. He visited patients, medics, community residents and workers, police officers, military personnel, officials and volunteers who have been fighting the novel coronavirus.Wearing a protective mask and accompanied by a retinue of military and health officials, Xi visited a makeshift hospital and community residents and frontline workers in Wuhan.Xi, who initially came under criticism for not acting in time to stem the virus when it emerged in December last year but later won praise for a decisive follow-up action, vowed to resolutely fight for a victory in the war against the virus, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.Xi said the spread of coronavirus had been curbed in Hubei Province and its capital Wuhan where over 50 million people lived in total isolation since January 23 following a complete lockdown of the areas.The initial success has been made in stabilising the situation and turning the tide in Hubei and Wuhan, Xi said.Meeting medic representatives in the hospital, Xi said the spread of the virus has been basically curbed in Hubei and Wuhan, and attributed the achievement to efforts of the whole country and the whole society.“But you are the biggest heroes,” Xi told the medics.This is the second visit by a top Chinese leader to Wuhan.Chinese Premier Li Keqiang visited Wuhan on January 26 when the COVID-19 virus spread at an alarming pace, prompting a lockdown of the city and the Central Hubei province with 50 million people.Xi called for firm and meticulous prevention and control efforts to defend Hubei and Wuhan. He said the situation in the province has shown positive changes with important progress, but the task of prevention and control remains arduous.He stressed on taking epidemic prevention and control as a task of paramount importance.Praising the people of Wuhan, Xi said the positive trend in epidemic control could not have been achieved without their sacrifice, devotion and perseverance.With their concrete actions, the people of Wuhan have demonstrated the strength and spirit of China, as well as the Chinese people’s love for their family and nation, which enables them to stick together through thick and thin, he said.On behalf of the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC), he condoled the death of people and medical staff who sacrificed their lives fighting on the frontline.Over 3,000 medical staff were reportedly infected with 10 fatalities.The frontline medical workers have taken on the most arduous missions, Xi said, calling them “the most admirable people in the new era” who deserve the highest commendations.Xi talked with patients in hospital through a video link, and expressed his wishes for their quick recovery.“All prevention and control measures taken by the CPC Central Committee against the virus are to prevent more people from being infected and save more patients’ lives,” Xi said.Coinciding with his visit, Chinese officials announced that 14 makeshift hospitals have been dismantled in Wuhan as cases have dramatically dropped.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-reports-22-new-coronavirus-deaths-president-xi-makes-first-visit-to-epicentre-wuhan/story-epvY7HfZq0Da9LXomtgHiK.html
11-03-2020||World||Coronavirus is ending a 16-Year plane boom for Boeing and Airbus||Boeing Co. and Airbus SE, which until recently couldn’t make planes fast enough to satisfy airlines, are suddenly contending with the opposite risk: churning out jets with no buyers.Demand for new aircraft is drying up as customers wary of the coronavirus shun air travel, ending the longest boom in aviation history. That 16-year surge began as airlines emerged from another infectious disease crisis, the one related to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS. Now the new virus points to leaner times.In less than a month, the tumult has clipped about $175 billion in market value from the U.S. aerospace industry, a critical source of American exports. And the future looks just as grim. Passenger revenues could drop as much as $113 billion this year if the virus spreads extensively, according to the International Air Transport Association, the largest global airline trade group.Also Watch | Coronavirus: What we know and what we don’t“I personally think it will get worse before it gets better,” said Domhnal Slattery, chief executive officer of Avolon, the third-largest global aircraft leasing company.Boeing and Airbus, which were rolling in cash while airlines went on a $1.15 trillion buying binge stretching back to 2008, are now intently focused on preserving capital and avoiding making “white tails.” That’s the industry term for buyer-less aircraft. Even well heeled carriers such as Delta Air Lines Inc. and United Airlines Holdings Inc., are carefully assessing plans to add new jetliners.Travel restrictions related to the pandemic are preventing airline representatives from China, the biggest international market for new airplanes, from even visiting Boeing’s delivery center in Seattle or Airbus’s in France to test-fly and sign ownership papers for new jets.Other CrisesChicago-based Boeing was already contending with a drop in advance payments from customers of its 737 Max aircraft, grounded after two crashes. Now that plane is nearing a return to service at a time when few airlines want new aircraft.The collapse in long-range flying threatens another critical source of cash for Boeing: deliveries of its 787 Dreamliners, which can carry passengers from Sydney to Chicago without refueling.Boeing said it is closely monitoring the market and customer needs. The company has already drawn down $7.5 billion of the $13.8 billion it borrowed in January to help bolster cash until the Max is back in the market.“Managing our liquidity and balance sheet are key focus areas,” a spokesman said, adding that it will “assess all levers to help provide adequate liquidity as we navigate the current challenges.”During periods of tumult, Toulouse, France-based Airbus sets up what it describes as a “watch tower.” That involves devoting extra personnel to help distressed customers delay aircraft orders, as well as letting opportunistic buyers jump the line. The company was able to move more than 600 orders around in this way between 2009 and 2011, following the last global economic shock.The European plane manufacturer is using the same system to manage coronavirus impact, as “commercial, production and finance teams monitor a number of parameters on a daily, weekly and monthly basis,” a spokesman said.Plunging TrafficAirline traffic is expected to contract this year for only the fourth time since the Great Depression, although the full impact will depend on how long the Covid-19 virus continues to spread, said Ron Epstein, an analyst with Bank of America Corp. Oil prices are also plunging after Saudi Arabia decided to remove pricing curbs, giving airlines less incentive to trade in older, less fuel-efficient models.“We’re deflating from a very high altitude and that’s concerning,” said Richard Aboulafia, aerospace analyst with Teal Group. “We’ve had one very bad year of traffic, and it’s going to be followed by an even worse year of traffic.”On the sidelines of last week’s ISTAT Americas conference of aircraft financiers, manufacturers and operators in Austin, Texas, executives looked for parallels to the industry slump that lasted two years after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. During that span, the compound annual growth rate of revenue for Boeing and Airbus and their constellation of suppliers was about minus 11%, by Aboulafia’s calculation.The correction would be more devastating if airlines’ hadn’t already cut back because of other problems: The 737 Max grounding last year, industrial foul-ups that have delayed Airbus’s narrow-body jets and durability issues that have plagued the three major jet engine manufacturers, said consultant Adam Pilarski, former chief economist for McDonnell Douglas before it merged with Boeing.“If all the airplanes that were ordered that were supposed to be delivered would have come, this bubble would’ve been enormous,” Pilarski said. “But we started deflating it by having incompetent manufacturers. Luckily it’s all of them.”Airline Failures?Still, United President Scott Kirby is among those warning there will be more airline failures, particularly outside of the U.S. When carriers shut down, they leave behind fleets of used planes -- further crimping demand for new models.“Airlines are desperate to cut capacity, costs and crew, but cannot do it quickly enough,” said Shukor Yusof, founder of aviation consultant Endau Analytics in Malaysia. “There will soon be airlines going out of business.”Others are more optimistic, noting that other outbreaks ended in a matter of months, and pent-up demand for travel will return. Over more than a half century, commercial aviation has weathered so-called “black swan” events where air traffic stalls, only to come back stronger in the end, said John Plueger, CEO of Air Lease Corp., the largest publicly traded U.S. aircraft lessor.“There’s no doubt in my mind that this, too, shall pass,” he said.But with China reeling and globalization waning, the 2020s are likely to be a sobering comedown from the frothy era that followed the 2008 financial crisis.“We’re into a decade of cooling the jets and sticking to the knitting,” Avolon’s Slattery said. “I think it’s a decade of growth, but I don’t think it’s the pace we saw over the last decade.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-is-ending-a-16-year-plane-boom-for-boeing-and-airbus/story-gidzwJKNiwrExOncK8F80M.html

Another nine people are missing from the collapse on Saturday.A 10-year-old boy and his mother had been rescued around midnight Monday after being trapped for 52 hours. The condition of all three survivors remains unknown.The hotel in the city of Quanzhou had been a quarantine site for people exposed to the new coronavirus, which has infected more than 80,000 people in China though about three-fourths of them have recovered. The virus causes mild symptoms such as fever and cough for most people but can cause serious illness such as pneumonia for others, especially older adults and people with existing health problems.Most parts of China are quarantining people for 14 days if they are from high-risk areas or even traveled abroad or simply outside their home regions.Rescuers at the scene of the collapse had protective gear and disinfectant to minimize exposure to the virus.The building had reportedly been modified illegally before the collapse||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/man-rescued-after-69-hours-in-rubble-of-china-hotel-quarantined-for-coronavirus/story-KnR1OLcLmvOqCQXbDhKylJ.html
11-03-2020||World||Coronavirus: UK health minister tests positive for Covid-19, met PM Johnson last week||British MP Nadine Dorries, a minister in the health department, has tested positive for coronavirus, she said in a statement on Tuesday, raising concerns about whether senior government figures have been infected.“I can confirm I have tested positive for coronavirus... and have been self-isolating at home,” said the Conservative MP.Health officials are now trying to trace where she contracted the virus and who she has been in contact with, she added. Also Watch | Coronavirus: Italy extends nationwide restrictions as death toll touches 460Six people have died in Britain from the virus, with more than 370 confirmed cases.Dorries, who helped craft the legislation to fight the bug, is the first British politician to be diagnosed with COVID-19.The Times reported that she had been in touch with hundreds of people, including Prime Minister Boris Johnson.She fell unwell on Friday while signing the document that declared coronavirus a notifiable disease, meaning companies could obtain insurance cover, said the paper, adding she was now believed to be on the road to recovery.“I would like to thank... the wonderful NHS staff who have provided me with advice and support,” she said, referring to Britain’s National Health Service.The shock news is likely to increase calls to suspend parliament, despite the government’s reluctance to do so in the middle of a health crisis.Her boss Matt Hancock, who is leading Britain’s response, tweeted that he was “sorry to hear Nadine has tested positive for coronavirus.“She has done the right thing by self isolating at home, and both NHS and PHE staff have been brilliant. We all wish her well as she recovers,” he added. PHE refers to Public Health England.“We will do all we can to keep people safe, based on the best possible science.”Finance minister Rishi Sunak will on Wednesday unveil the government’s first post-Brexit budget, with all eyes on emergency government measures to ease the economic pain from the coronavirus outbreak.He is expected to give the state-run National Health Service whatever it needs to help combat the virus and promise temporary support for businesses hit by cash flow issues.The Bank of England’s incoming chief Andrew Bailey last week said UK-based companies would need help in the face of disruption to supplies caused by the virus.Budget airlines Ryanair and EasyJet said they will cancel all Italian flights until early April after the government ordered the entire country locked down because of the virus, leaving thousands of people unable to return home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-uk-health-minister-nadine-dorries-tests-positive-for-covid-19/story-UvSzzY6vxHaTtadVgXdexJ.html
