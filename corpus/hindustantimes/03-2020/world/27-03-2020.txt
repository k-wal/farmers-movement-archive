27-03-2020||World||After Prince Charles, PM Boris Johnson hit by coronavirus||Prime Minister Boris Johnson revealed on Friday that he has tested positive for coronavirus and will remain in isolation in Downing Street. This was soon followed with similar messages by health secretary Matt Hancock and chief medical officer Chris Whitty.Johnson, 55, has been leading the UK government’s response to the pandemic with Hancock and Whitty, among other key figures such as chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance. Whitty and Vallance have often joined Johnson at daily briefings.The three top figures in the fight against the virus testing positive was followed by figures of the sharpest rise in the number of daily deaths in the UK: 759 dead (up from 578 on Thursday), and 14,579 cases. Large exhibition centres in London, Birmingham and Manchester are being turned into hospitals with military help.Johnson said he will continue to lead the government response to coronavirus from home, but if he is unable to perform his duties as the prime minister, Downing Street announced earlier this week that foreign secretary Dominic Raab will take charge of the UK government.Hancock has been closely involved in the response, including stacking boxes of masks and protective equipment to be transported to medical staff across the UK.Johnson’s announcement sparked a flood of messages on social media from people inside and outside the UK, including by leaders such as Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who tweeted: “You’re a fighter and you will overcome this challenge as well. Prayers for your good health and best wishes in ensuring a healthy UK”.Johnson took part in the nation-wide applause to NHS workers at 8pm on Thursday outside the door of No 10, Downing Street, along with chancellor Rishi Sunak. Johnson’s partner, Carrie Symonds, who is pregnant, is also in self-isolation.Prince Charles, who tested positive while in Scotland, thanked people for support. His office in Clarence House said: “He is enormously touched by your kind words”. Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip have moved to Windsor Castle. WATCH| UK PM Boris Johnson tests positive for coronavirus, says he’s self-isolatingJohnson said in the video message: “I want to bring you up to speed on something that’s happening today which is that I’ve developed mild symptoms of the coronavirus. That’s to say - a temperature and a persistent cough.“And, on the advice of the Chief Medical Officer, I’ve taken a test. That has come out positive. So I am working from home. I’m self-isolating. And that’s entirely the right thing to do. But be in no doubt that I can continue, thanks to the wizardry of modern technology, to communicate with all my top team to lead the national fightback against coronavirus”.Johnson is unlikely to appear in the daily press briefings in Downing Street, at which journalists are no longer physically present but put their questions through video-link from homes. Thursday’s briefing was held by Sunak, who has not been tested since he does not have symptoms so far, officials said.Johnson remained upbeat in his message but reiterated his core message in recent days: ‘Stay at home’.He said: “I want to thank everybody who’s working to keep our country going through this epidemic. And we will get through it. And the way we’re going to get through it is, of course, by applying the measures that you’ll have heard so much about”.“And the more effectively we all comply with those measures, the faster our country will come through this epidemic and the faster we’ll bounce back. So thank you to everybody who’s doing what I’m doing, working from home, to stop the spread of the virus from household to household”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-prime-minister-boris-johnson-tests-positive-for-coronavirus/story-eOytNAMBGYfnmPWd1CCTCI.html
27-03-2020||World||‘Covid-19 will continue to surge at a greater cost if...’: Stanford expert||From China to Italy and the United States to Australia - coronavirus disease has travelled across the globe, spawned over continents and infected a staggering 500,000 people worldwide. India, home to 1.3 billion people, has hastened its response and bolstered its efforts to fight the deadly contagion. Although global health bodies such as the World Health Organisation have hailed India’s move to initiate the 21-day lockdown, experts suggest working in isolation will not solve the Covid-19 problem at the macro level.Matthew Jackson, William D Eberle professor of Economics at Stanford’s School of Humanities of Sciences believes that a combined effort by all states and countries is needed to wipe out the virus from the face of the Earth, lest it raises its ugly head again like a disease relapse.“Managing the crisis requires a comprehensive and coordinated response between states within the US and across countries and continents, otherwise, the problem will continue to surge at a greater cost to the global economy and public health,” said Jackson in a published piece on Stanford’s blog.Beating Covid-19“Without coordination within and across countries we will end up endlessly reacting to resurgences of the virus”.“Locking areas down is a blunt instrument. It slows the virus down locally, but our research and common sense makes clear that, given the lack of coordination, it is not likely to be successful for long and will end up being extremely costly,” he said.The efficient way to tackle the spread of the virus would be to meticulously find out the exact point of its eruption and waste no time in dealing with it.“A combination of basic social distancing, and blanket testing with fast reactions, would involve the least disruption. In the meanwhile, as we devote all necessary resources to make tests more widely available, and push hard on developing a vaccine, we need to coordinate internationally on our containment strategies,” Jackson noted.The expert noted that lack of coordination, both within a country as well as with its international partners, will yield a lopsided result in tackling the Covid-19 crisis. In this manner, while one area will be striving hard to control the virus and minimising the number of cases, it will continue to grow and multiply somewhere else.“Once it is under control in the first area, it can return from another area. An analogy is trying to get rid of termites in a house. There is a reason they fumigate the whole house all at once, even if only a few parts of it show large infestations,” the blog read.Logically speaking, a country can’t remain in a state of lockdown for a long period, we cannot seal our borders completely. “Thus, without coordination within and across countries we will end up endlessly reacting to resurgences of the virus”.More than 24,000 people have died due to the Sars-CoV-2 virus across the world with Italy standing at the top with 8,215 deaths, followed by Spain (4,365) and China (3,169). The United States is now emerging as the new epicentre of the virus with cases going beyond what China has reported. According to the latest data shared by Johns Hopkins University, America now has more than 85,600 positive Covid-19 cases. China has reported under 82,000 cases till date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-will-continue-to-surge-at-a-greater-cost-if-stanford-expert/story-2C7dlOeXt57jWafCjEtiBI.html

This took the number of patients in the country to over 85,600, according to Johns Hopkins University data.A week ago, the number of confirmed cases in the US were 8,000. It has dangerously surged 10 times in the span of a week.According to Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE), America’s nationwide tally of Covid-19 cases grew over 10,000 cases in less than five hours.New York City has become the epicentre of the virus with the maximum number of deaths and over 37,802 cases. According to the university estimates, of the total 1,178 Covid-19 deaths in the country, nearly 300 come from New York City. The US Senate on Wednesday passed an unparalleled $2.2 trillion economic rescue package steering aid to businesses, workers and health care systems in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak.More than 24,000 people have died due to the Sars-CoV-2 virus across the world with Italy standing at the top with 8,215 deaths, followed by Spain (4,365) and China (3,169), the university further stated.The virus has infected over 500,000 people across the world.

China, from where the virus originated, is the President of the UNSC till March 31, after which Dominican Republic takes over.According to diplomatic sources, while Russia and South Africa said that there was no direct link between the spread of virus and threat to peace and security of the world, China shot down the proposal saying that there was no consensus within the UNSC, a mandatory requirement to take up any proposal. Russia and South Africa are close trade partners of China with the latter being the stepping-stone to Beijing’s access into Africa.Follow Live Updates on CoronavirusWhile the Estonian proposal talked about transparency over the Covid-19 outbreak, there were hardly any takers for the proposal in the UNSC with all the permanent members being seriously afflicted by the rampaging virus.Also Watch | G20 nations meet to discuss COVID-19 crisis: Key takeaways“It is quite evident that none of the P-5 want to come up with a solution that is binding on them such as opening up the borders,” said a diplomat.It is not that the UN Security Council, which focuses on threats of peace and security, hasn’t discussed the impact of diseases. The UN Security Council has spoken about Ebola and its impact on more than one occasion since 2014. People familiar with the development said this had been possible because the United States had worded its proposal to underline that deaths due to the virus were exacerbating the conflict in west Africa, particularly Sierra Leone, and thus presenting a threat to global peace and security.“The fact is that no one wants to touch the UN as was evident in the G-20 meeting on Covid-19 on Thursday. While India wanted the century-old institution WHO (World Health Organisation) to be reformed, the rest wanted to strengthen the very institution that was shy in calling out China over the spread of virus. It is a cosy club, the UN, which does not accept any new members,” said a retired UN diplomat.It is being suggested that the real reason why almost every major country - Donald Trump has been an exception in this - is shy of calling out China is because Beijing has built excess medical capacities in the form of ventilators, HAZMAT suits, masks and other equipment required for treatment in the past three months.“All the countries are quiet over China as they may have to import the same equipment from them in case of a worst case scenario. Simply put, China first created the demand and now will supply it,” said a China watcher.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unsc-won-t-discuss-covid-19-china-blocks-it-with-help-from-russia-south-africa/story-qLYgAv6DMtfzPxBaIO2kiO.html

How individual countries respond in the coming weeks will be critical in influencing the trajectory of national epidemics,” said the report by the Imperial College Covid-19 Response Team.According to the report, in the absence of interventions – such as social distancing and shutting down of cities – the pandemic “would have resulted in 7.0 billion infections and 40 million deaths globally this year”. The virus, Sars-Cov-2, has infected close to 500,000 people and caused at least 22,000 fatalities till Thursday. According to estimates, the current global population is 7.8 billion. The most severe pandemic in history was the 1918 H1N1 outbreak -- commonly known as the Spanish Flu -- which is estimated to have infected close to a third of the population at the time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/study-explores-what-worst-case-looks-like/story-KTU0QI2nEvs1tquaGdQleK.html

Pakistan has, meanwhile, sought US $3.7 billion additional loan from three multilateral creditors to cope with the economic crisis being posed by the coronavirus outbreak, as the pandemic spread further in the country, infecting over 1,100 people and killing nine so far.In addition to US $1.4 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will extend loans of US $1 billion and US $1.25 billion respectively to the country, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Finance Abdul Hafeez Shaikh said at a news conference on Wednesday.Prime Minister Imran Khan had earlier announced a Rs 1.2 trillion economic relief package.Slight improvement was seen in worst-hit Sindh as the number of new cases slowed but it was increasing in Punjab, Balochistan, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Gilgit-Baltistan and federal capital areas.

27-03-2020||World||New Zealand mosque gunman pleads guilty to murder, terrorism||The man who committed the worst atrocity in New Zealand’s modern history when he slaughtered 51 worshippers at two Christchurch mosques unexpectedly pleaded guilty to all charges Thursday.The attacks targeting people praying at the mosques a year ago shocked the nation and prompted new laws banning the deadliest types of semi-automatic weapons. It also prompted global changes to social media protocols after the gunman livestreamed his attack on Facebook, where it was viewed by hundreds of thousands of people.The sudden turn in the case took survivors and relatives by surprise, and brought relief to people across New Zealand. Many had feared Australian white supremacist Brenton Harrison Tarrant would try to use his trial as a platform to promote his views. He’d outlined those views in a 74-page manifesto he published online shortly before the attacks.Tarrant, 29, pleaded guilty to 51 counts of murder, 40 counts of attempted murder and one count of terrorism at the Christchurch High Court. He had previously pleaded not guilty to all charges and his trial had been scheduled to start in June.Tarrant is the first person to be found guilty of terrorism in New Zealand under laws passed after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the U.S.The change in plea came less than two weeks after New Zealanders commemorated those who died on the anniversary of the March 15, 2019, attacks.“Honestly, I’m still trying to process what just happened,” said Aya Al-Umari, whose brother Hussein was killed in the attack on the Al Noor mosque. “I feel conflicted.”She said that on the one hand, she had wanted to find out more details about what happened at the trial but on the other hand was feeling relieved about not having to face the trauma of sitting through it.Temel Atacocugu, who survived being shot nine times during the attack at Al Noor, said he was surprised by the turn of events and hoped the judge would set an example at the sentencing by imposing the harshest punishment in the country’s history and helping ensure nothing like it would happen again.“I’m happy that he has accepted that he is guilty,” Atacocugu said.,Judge Cameron Mander has not yet set a sentencing date. Tarrant faces life imprisonment, with the judge having some discretion in deciding the minimum number of years Tarrant must serve before becoming eligible for parole.The change in plea came at a hastily arranged court hearing at a time that New Zealand was beginning a four-week lockdown to try and combat the new coronavirus. The lockdown meant Tarrant appeared in the court via video link from his jail cell in Auckland and only a handful of people were allowed inside the courtroom, including the imams from the two mosques that were attacked.Mander said it was unfortunate the lockdown prevented victims and family members from being able to attend the hearing but the imams were helping to represent them. He said he wanted to quickly move ahead with the hearing, especially with the COVID-19 response threatening delays to the court schedule.Tarrant, who was wearing a gray prison sweater, showed little emotion as he pleaded guilty. He didn’t indicate why he had changed his pleas, and his lawyer could not immediately be reached for comment.New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who was praised around the world for her empathetic response to the Muslim community after the attacks, said it was “deeply disappointing” the victims didn’t get to attend the hearing.But she said there was “a certain sense of relief that the whole nation, but particularly our Muslim community, are being spared from a trial that could have otherwise acted as a platform.”Tarrant moved to New Zealand in 2017 and kept a low profile in the university city of Dunedin. He frequented a gym, practiced shooting at a rifle club range and built up an arsenal of weapons. He didn’t appear to be employed, and said in some online posts that he’d inherited a significant amount of money when his father died.Tarrant appeared to have a fascination with religious conflicts in Europe and the Balkans, and visited a number of sites in Eastern Europe in the years before he committed the massacre. After his attack at the second mosque, Tarrant was driving, possibly to carry out a shooting at a third mosque, when two police officers rammed his car off the road, dragged him out and arrested him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-mosque-gunman-pleads-guilty-to-murder-terrorism/story-IhNVIJxmfQc7uWT0diPbhP.html

27-03-2020||World||Coronavirus update: US weekly jobless claims surge to record 3.28 million||The number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits surged to a record of more than 3 million last week as strict measures to contain the pandemic brought the country to a sudden halt, unleashing a wave of layoffs that likely ended the longest employment boom in US history.The weekly jobless claims report from the labour department on Thursday offered the clearest evidence yet of the coronavirus’ devastating impact on the economy, which has forced the Federal Reserve to take extraordinary steps and the US Congress to assemble a record $2 trillion stimulus package. Economists say the economy is already in recession. Weekly claims are the most timely labour market indicator. With nearly half the country’s population under some form of a lockdown, economists are bracing for further increases in jobless claims. “With lockdowns across the country leading to a sudden stop in economic activity, the US economy will experience the largest economic contraction on record with the most severe surge in unemployment ever,” said Gregory Daco, chief US economist at Oxford Economics in New York. “We expect jobless claims will continue to climb as more economic activity shuts down.”Initial claims for unemployment benefits rose 3 million to a seasonally adjusted 3.28 million in the week ending March 21, eclipsing the previous record of 695,000 set in 1982, the labour department said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims would rise to 1 million, though estimates were as high as 4 million.The labour department attributed the surge to Covid-19. “During the week ending March 21, the increase in initial claims are due to the impacts of the Covid-19 virus,” it said. “States continued to cite services industries broadly, particularly accommodation and food service. Additional industries heavily cited for the increases included the health care and social assistance, arts, entertainment and recreation, transportation and warehousing, and manufacturing industries.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-us-weekly-jobless-claims-surge-to-record-3-28-million/story-2ue84ILevW3bVSAIvZjWBI.html

27-03-2020||World||Coronavirus update: Covid-19 cases soar past 500,000 as virus batters US, Europe||More than a staggering 500,000 people have been infected by the coronavirus across the world while at least 22,000 have died as the Covid-19 pandemic continued to batter Europe and the US.On the European continent, Italy and Spain reported 662 and 498 single-day deaths respectively on Thursday, while across the Atlantic, the US saw its death toll shoot past 1,000. More than 15,000 new infections were confirmed in the US over a 24-hour period.China, Italy, the US, Spain and Germany are now the five worst-hit nations in terms of confirmed cases. Spain reported 498 new fatalities on Thursday as its death toll climbed to 4,145, while the Netherlands confirmed more than 1,000 new cases -and 78 single-day deaths. In the UK, the streets are empty but hospitals are filling up to the extent that health officials describe the registration of new cases as a “continuous tsunami”. Deaths in the UK rose to 477 and close to 10,000 cases have been reported.Britain brought in tough measures on Thursday to curb the spread of the coronavirus. The new powers allow police to issue instant fines to those who leave their homes without good reason or gather in groups of more than two people.As the US continued to witness an exponential increase in the number of cases, White House experts warned of a second wave that could come later in the year as demonstrated by previous pandemics of this magnitude.Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, at a daily briefing, spoke of the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic that had killed 50 million people worldwide. That epidemic had come in three waves. Anthony Fauci, another member of the task force, said the coronavirus could become a “seasonal cyclic thing”.These warnings came as the US continued to deal with a ballooning crisis that caused 1,080 deaths until Thursday and infected over 70,000 people.
