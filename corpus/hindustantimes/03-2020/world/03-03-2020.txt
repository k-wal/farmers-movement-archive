All three are moderate Democrats, same as Biden.“When I ran for president we made it clear that the whole idea was about rallying the country together to defeat Donald Trump and to win the era for the values that we share,” Buttigieg said, with Biden standing behind him at a campaign stop. “And that was always a goal that was much bigger than me becoming president and it is in the name of that very same goal that I am delighted to endorse and support Joe Biden for President.”These endorsements on the eve of the Super Tuesday nominating contests are being seen as a major boost for the former vice-president, who is hoping to build on the momentum his campaign got from the massive victory in the South Carolina primaries, that some are calling “Joementum” (collapsing Joe and momentum). It’s became a two-man race between Biden and Sanders, even though Senator Elizabeth Warren, billionaire Michael Bloomberg and Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard are still around. The Tuesday contests are the first time Bloomberg is on the ballot in these primaries, and will be closely watched.Millions of voters will be participating in the Super Tuesday contests in 14 states — which include California, New York, Alabama, Illinois and Massachusetts — and American Samoa, a US territory. At stake are 34% of the 3,979 pledged delegates who will elect the nominee in the event of a contested presidential convention to be held in July. A candidate needs 1,991 of them to win the nomination, in the first round. The contests goes into the second round if no one gets that number, and then 771 more delegates join the voting.Sanders is leading in delegate count with 60, and Biden is behind him with 56. The Super Tuesday contests could potentially turn the race and propel the former vice-president to the top of the race, if he does well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-picks-up-key-endorsements-in-democratic-presidential-nomination-ahead-of-super-tuesday/story-2mC5Zf1QB1iZRk9dhxI43H.html

03-03-2020||World||Quit, Labour tells Priti Patel, as new ‘bullying’ charges emerge||Labour on Tuesday demanded that home secretary Priti Patel step down while the inquiry into allegations of bullying against her is carried out, as details emerged of a £25,000 settlement to a bureaucrat who complained against her in 2015 when she was employment minister.The Cabinet Office inquiry was announced on Monday after the top civil servant in the Home Office, Philip Rutnam, resigned publicly, levelling a series of allegations against her and announcing his intention to sue the government. Patel has rejected the allegations.The 2015 complaint relates to Patel’s former aide who received the payout from the government after claiming she was bullied by her . The person took an overdose of medicine following the alleged incident. Her department did not admit liability and the case did not come before a tribunal.Legal correspondence reported by the BBC shows the employee bringing a formal complaint of bullying and harassment against the department, including Patel, after being dismissed from her role in October 2015.The staff member alleges she was told the decision to dismiss her a year later was not made on performance grounds but because Patel did not “like (her) face”, according to comments attributed to her line-manager and a colleague.Patel had also reportedly shouted at the woman in her private office and told her to “get lost” and “get out of her face”, the correspondence alleges. Patel is described as having acted “without warning” and with an “unprovoked level of aggression”, in the complaint.Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott called on Patel to stand down while the inquiry is carried out. According to her, the Cabinet Office inquiry was not sufficiently impartial to restore public trust in the relationship between the government and the civil service.“We’ve had other allegations come up overnight and unless you have a conclusive and independent inquiry this thing may run on to the detriment of Priti herself and the government. I’m afraid it would be better if she stood down. We are calling on her to step down while the inquiry goes on,” Abbott said.Employee union leaders questioned the confidence placed in Patel by Prime Minister Boris Johnson and other ministers before the inquiry has completed its work and arrived at a conclusion on the allegations.Rutnam, who resigned over the weekend, said his experience in office under Patel had been “extreme”, adding that he had received allegations that her conduct included “shouting and swearing, belittling people, making unreasonable and repeated demands - behaviour that created fear and that needed some bravery to call out”.Accusing Patel of orchestrating a campaign against him, he said in a statement: “In the last 10 days, I have been the target of a vicious and orchestrated briefing campaign. It has been alleged that I have briefed the media against the home secretary”.“This - along with many other claims - is completely false. The home secretary categorically denied any involvement in this campaign to the Cabinet Office. I regret I do not believe her. She has not made the efforts I would expect to dissociate herself from the comments.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/quit-labour-tells-priti-patel-as-new-bullying-charges-emerge/story-tZ76GAxsbq9UuJ31RjAwEL.html

03-03-2020||World||UK, so far mildly affected, prepares for severe coronavirus spread||Retired doctors may be called back to work, police could stop investigating minor crimes and local authorities may struggle to deal with the burden of extra deaths if a new coronavirus spreads widely across Britain, the government said Tuesday.Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government unveiled a 25-page “action plan” laying out measures it may have to take in a worst-case scenario, when millions of people could be infected and thousands might die.“It’s quite unusual for a government to publish a plan with things in it we hope we won’t have to do,” Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the BBC.Johnson’s government has been accused of being slow to respond to the illness, which was first identified late last year in China. So far, Britain has fewer cases of the disease than some other European countries such as Italy and France, with only 40 confirmed infections. But officials say a much wider spread of the disease is likely.“It may be that widespread exposure in the U.K, is inevitable, but slowing it down would still nonetheless be beneficial,” the government document says.Scientists are still racing to learn about the new virus, and Britain says it is prepared for a range of severities — from the equivalent of a mild winter flu outbreak causing a few hundred deaths, to something like the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic that killed an estimated 200,000 people in Britain and tens of millions worldwide.British experts have previously said a worst-case scenario could see 80% of the U.K’s 66 million people become infected, with 500,000 deaths, though they stress they do not think that is the most likely outcome.For now, experts say they best thing people can do to stop the disease spreading is the simplest: wash hands frequently with warm, soapy water.U.K. authorities say they may have to close schools, cancel mass-attendance events and tell large numbers of people to work from home as part of “social distancing strategies” designed to delay the spread of the disease until summer, when flu season is over and pressure on the health service lessens.Retired doctors and nurses could be put back to work to ease medical staff shortages, and school class sizes could be increased if teachers fall ill.The U.K. government says more drastic measures if it spreads widely could include rationing of medicines and a stripping back by emergency services to their “critical functions.”“For example, with a significant loss of officers and staff, the police would concentrate on responding to serious crimes and maintaining public order,” the document says.The government says its strategy aims to protect those most vulnerable to the disease: the elderly and those with underlying health conditions.It also raises the prospect of many extra deaths, and says the government “will provide advice to local authorities on dealing with this challenge.”The action plan notes that in the event of a widespread outbreak, “pressures on services and wider society may start to become significant and clearly noticeable.” It says actions will only be taken on the advice of the government’s medical experts.The government also plans new legislation to ensure it has “all the necessary powers’‘ to respond to the outbreak. It has not revealed details.British media report that the legislation is likely to give border officials the power to deny entry to anyone suspected of carrying the virus, while the government may also get the power to close schools and prevent mass public gatherings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-so-far-mildly-affected-prepares-for-severe-coronavirus-spread/story-vYEzGv0AXlcUogQQx7nPXN.html
03-03-2020||World||Iran says 77 dead amid 2,336 cases of new coronavirus||Iran says there are 77 dead amid 2,336 cases of the new coronavirus in the Islamic Republic.That’s according to Ali Reza Raisi, a Health Ministry official, who gave a news conference Tuesday in Tehran.Iran’s supreme leader earlier on Tuesday ordered the Islamic Republic’s armed forces to assist its Health Ministry in combating the spread of the new coronavirus.The decision by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei comes as Iran has the highest death toll from the new virus and the COVID-19 illness it causes outside of China, the epicenter of the virus.Khamenei’s decision was announced after state media broadcast images of him planting a tree wearing disposable gloves ahead of Iran’s upcoming arbor day.Iran’s supreme leader ordered on Tuesday the Islamic Republic’s armed forces to assist its Health Ministry in combating the spread of the new coronavirus.The decision by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei comes as Iran has the highest death toll from the new virus and the COVID-19 illness it causes outside of China, the epicenter of the virus.Khamenei’s decision was announced after state media broadcast images of him planting a tree wearing disposable gloves ahead of Iran’s upcoming arbor day.“Whatever helps public health and prevents the spread of the disease is good and what helps to spread it is sin,” Khamenei said.After downplaying the coronavirus as recently as last week, Iranian authorities now say they have plans to potentially mobilize 300,000 soldiers and volunteers to confront the virus.Concern over the outbreak now stretches to Iran’s top leadership — some of whom have fallen ill from the virus.An activist group also said Tuesday that Wikipedia’s Farsi-language website appeared to be disrupted in Iran after a close confidant to the supreme leader died of the new coronavirus.The advocacy group NetBlocks linked the death of Expediency Council member Mohammad Mirmohammadi to the disruption, though Iranian officials and its state media did not immediately acknowledge it. Authorities face increasing criticism from the Iranian public over the outbreak amid concerns the number of cases from the virus may be higher than currently reported.NetBlocks described the disruption to accessing Farsi Wikipedia as being nationwide, saying its technical testing suggests the online encyclopedia is being blocked by the same mechanism used to block Twitter and Facebook. Those social media websites have been banned since Iran’s disputed 2009 presidential election and Green Movement protests.Some Iranians said they couldn’t access Wikipedia’s Farsi website since Monday night. Others said they could, including through the site’s mobile-friendly pages.“The new restrictions come as Iran faces a growing crisis following the loss of senior state figures to coronavirus and a spate of criticism and misinformation have spread through social media,” NetBlocks said in its analysis.The Wikimedia Foundation, which oversees the volunteer-edited encyclopedia, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. NetBlocks previously reported internet disruptions affecting Iran in recent days and users across the Islamic Republic have reported problems.The disruption raises fears of Iran potentially shutting off the internet entirely again, as it did for a week during economic protests in November. Iran separately has created its own so-called “halal” net of government-approved websites.Iran announced Monday that the virus had killed at least 66 people among 1,501 confirmed cases. There are now 1,700 cases of the new coronavirus across the Mideast. Of those outside Iran in the region, most link back to the Islamic Republic, which after China has the highest death toll from the COVID-19 illness caused by the virus.Yet experts still worry Iran’s percentage of deaths to infections, now around 4.4%, is much higher than other countries, suggesting the number of infections in Iran may be far greater than current figures show. Saudi Arabia and Jordan meanwhile announced their first cases of the virus Monday.Iran stands alone in how the virus has affected its government, even compared to hard-hit China, the epicenter of the outbreak.Mirmohammadi’s death makes him the highest-ranking official within Iran’s theocracy to be killed by the virus. The virus earlier killed Hadi Khosroshahi, Iran’s former ambassador to the Vatican, as well as a recently elected member of parliament.Those sick include Vice President Masoumeh Ebtekar, better known as “Sister Mary,” the English-speaking spokeswoman for the students who seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979 and sparked the 444-day hostage crisis, state media reported. Also sick is Iraj Harirchi, the head of an Iranian government task force on the coronavirus who tried to downplay the virus before falling ill.Meanwhile Tuesday, the Middle East’s largest airline, Emirates, said it had to reduce or ground flights due to the new virus. Because of the slowdown, the government-owned carrier has asked its employees to take paid and even unpaid leave for up to a month at a time. Emirates’ operates out of Dubai, the world’s busiest for international travel.“We have been tested before and Emirates will come out stronger,” Chief Operating Officer Adel Al-Redha said.The world’s largest airline trade association, IATA, says Mideast carriers have already lost around $100 million in revenue due to a drop in ticket sales because of disruptions caused by the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-says-77-dead-amid-2-336-cases-of-new-coronavirus/story-XowKyrMM7mbSJAy11XnGfK.html

03-03-2020||World||Chinese doctor’s intense 21 days at coronavirus clinic treating over 200 patients||For Dr. Fan Hong, the 21 days as the head of one of the first frontline fever clinics set up to screen Covid-19 patients at outbreak ground zero Wuhan were the most intense three weeks in her 32-year career.At the end of it – after treating more than 200 severe and critically ill patients with her team -- she transferred out of the fever clinic at the Wuhan Union Medical College (WUMC) hospital physically exhausted and emotionally rattled. She spent 10-12 hours daily at the fever clinic for those 21 days.For over a month now, Fan spends her non-working hours in quarantined isolation – away from her husband and daughter in Wuhan and her critically ill mother in another locked-down city in Hubei province in central China.Fan, 54, doesn’t clearly remember what she was doing when she was informed that her diabetic mother had to be rushed to a hospital ICU in Huanggang city, some 70 km from Wuhan, in January.“Maybe I was in the clinic, maybe I was in quarantine”. Fan’s sleep at the indifferent quarantined hotel room in Wuhan is hostage to the recurring flashes in her mind of lines of patients slumped outside the clinic who she could not admit or treat because of a lack of beds.There were times, she simply sobbedIn a rare, government-sanctioned interview, Fan spoke to HT over phone and WeChat, sharing her experience in a mellow, tired voice through a translator.As the deputy director of the emergency department at the WUMC hospital, Fan was fully responsible for running the newly formed fever clinic.It wasn’t easy. “On the one hand, we lacked the medical staff, on the other hand, we lacked the space (for) treating the people. We lacked places. At that time, we had opened only a limited number of medical institutions for treating covid-19,” she said.“So, we didn’t have enough hospitals. And also we did not have enough medical staff. I am not saying that in my department we needed more hands but because the hospital area is so limited, we needed to expand the hospital area, and we needed more hands,” Fan, also a visiting scholar at the US’s Utah university’s school of medicine, said.The doctor remembered an infected man in his 40s who died; his father and wife were also infected, one of the first “family cluster” cases, Fan dealt with.“When we received him, he was in a severe condition. We put him on a ventilator. Sadly, he passed away. I was very sad about the case”.Fan and her team of 19 doctors and 30 nurses were luckier than many other medics.As frontline medics working at the very first level of infection screening, they did not face any critical shortage of protective clothing.“Because we were at the very frontline, so the medical supplies were directed to us,” Fan said, adding that no medic in her team was infected.The senior doctor’s response was both guarded and revealing when asked about Dr. Li Wenliang, the whistleblower doctor, reprimanded by the police for sharing news of the outbreak on social media, who later died of the infection.“Li Wenliang was an ordinary clinical doctor. When he found out about this disease, he warned a group of people. He did this out of a doctor’s sharpness and conscience. I think he did what he should have done,” Fan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-doctor-s-intense-21-days-at-coronavirus-clinic-treating-over-200-patients/story-DQnFuAPa2T9Iwe2GxR8R6K.html
03-03-2020||World||China reports rise in imported virus cases||China reported an increase Tuesday in cases of the new coronavirus coming from abroad, as the country where the disease first emerged now worries about importing infections.In total there have been 13 confirmed cases of the virus being imported to the mainland -- all in Chinese nationals returning from overseas.More than 3,100 people have died and over 90,000 have been infected worldwide.The vast majority of cases are in China, but South Korea, Italy and Iran have emerged as the countries with the most cases outside the epicentre.Eight Chinese nationals who worked in the same restaurant in Italy’s northern Lombardy region have tested positive for the virus in eastern Zhejiang province, according to the local government.They flew home to China from Italy last week.There have also been four confirmed cases of infections originating in Iran -- two in Beijing and two in the northern Ningxia region -- and one case in the southern city of Shenzhen in a person who had travelled from Britain via Hong Kong.China has been implementing a series of measures to try and prevent its containment efforts being undone by cases brought into the country.Those arriving in the capital from virus-hit countries -- including South Korea, Italy, Iran and Japan -- must self-quarantine for 14 days, the deputy secretary of Beijing’s government said at a press briefing Tuesday.“If their destination is Beijing, everyone should be quarantined no matter whether they are Chinese or foreigners,” said the official, Chen Bei.Those with a fixed residence should stay home, he said, while those without anywhere to stay would do “concentrated medical observation at a designated hotel”.Officials in southern Guangdong province announced Tuesday they would implement similar measures, without confirming specific countries, while state media reported that Shanghai was also introducing the same rule for nations with high numbers of virus cases.Also on Tuesday, officials in Dandong -- which borders North Korea -- announced everyone entering the city from abroad needed to be tested.Hundreds of passengers from South Korea arriving in eastern China last week were placed in isolation after people on two flights were discovered to have fevers.No infections have been confirmed so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-reports-rise-in-imported-virus-cases/story-vqdZT0zJ9TAk2oXurQrMiK.html

03-03-2020||World||North Korea says weapons test was ‘long-range artillery’: Report||North Korean state media published pictures Tuesday of leader Kim Jong Un supervising what it called a “long-range artillery” drill, after Seoul said Pyongyang had launched two short-range ballistic missiles in its first weapons test for months.The images in the Rodong Sinmun newspaper included pictures of multiple launch rocket systems, and several of a larger calibre rocket being fired from a launcher in a forest.The exercise came as the North battles to prevent a coronavirus outbreak but Kim -- wearing a black leather greatcoat and gloves, and a bushy Russian-style hat -- did not don a facemask to supervise the firing, although an officer accompanying him had a black covering over his mouth.Kim expressed “great satisfaction” with the results, telling the troops to keep in mind “the iron will and ardent patriotism to defend as strong as an iron wall the socialist homeland dearer than their own lives” the official KCNA news agency reported.South Korea said that Monday’s launch appeared to be two short-range ballistic missiles -- which the nuclear-armed North is banned from testing under UN Security Council resolutions.The South Korean military said two devices were fired eastwards over the sea from the Wonsan area on the North’s east coast and flew 240 kilometres (150 miles) at a maximum altitude of 35 kilometres.The North also appeared to be carrying on a firing drill that began Friday, it added.Pyongyang was seeking to “normalise” tests of new weapons by firing them alongside existing systems and “framing it simply as extension of rocket artillery drills”, said Joseph Dempsey of the International Institute for Strategic Studies.The nuclear-armed North carried out a series of tests last year it often described as multiple rocket launch systems, and which were repeatedly played down by US President Donald Trump.- Coronavirus proposal -Monday’s drills came days after the one-year anniversary of the collapse of the Hanoi summit, after which nuclear negotiations have been at a standstill over sanctions relief and what the North would be willing to give up in return.Pyongyang set Washington an end-of-year deadline to offer it fresh concessions, and as it expired Kim declared the North no longer considered itself bound by its moratoriums on nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests, threatening to demonstrate a “new strategic weapon” soon.Seoul and Washington last week postponed forthcoming joint military exercises over the coronavirus outbreak -- the South has nearly 5,000 infections -- and President Moon Jae-in offered to co-operate over the disease with the North, which has closed its borders to try to prevent a potentially devastating outbreak.The moves had generated “no goodwill” from the North, said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, which was making clear “it will continue to improve military capabilities and make outsized demands, despite the political and public health preoccupations of Beijing, Seoul and Washington”.Nonetheless Tuesday’s KCNA report made no mention of the US nor South Korea, and Ahn Chan-il, a defector and researcher in Seoul, said the drill may have been aimed at a domestic audience after the dismissal of two top Workers’ Party officials last week.“Aside from putting pressure on the US, the launch is to deliberately stoke sentiment within its domestic sphere for political purposes,” Ahn told AFP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-says-weapons-test-was-long-range-artillery-report/story-O2lUI1mhO2dqc8IB0RHjxH.html
03-03-2020||World||Amid coronavirus outbreak, Angela Merkel’s minister refuses her a handshake||Germany’s interior minister rebuffed Chancellor Angela Merkel’s attempt to shake hands with him on Monday as the number of novel coronavirus cases in the country rose to 157 with Berlin reporting its first infection.When Merkel reached out to greet Horst Seehofer at a meeting on migration in Berlin, he smiled and kept both his hands to himself.They both laughed and Merkel then threw her hand up in the air before taking a seat.Health experts have recommended avoiding handshakes as a way of preventing the spread of the novel coronavirus.There are now 157 confirmed cases in Germany, the Robert Koch Institute disease control agency said on Monday -- up from 129 the previous day. The alert level has been raised from “low to moderate” to “moderate,” Lothar Weiler of the Robert Koch Institute said.However, authorities say drastic measures such as border closures to stem the contagion are not needed.The coronavirus has now spread to 10 of Germany’s 16 states, with more than half the confirmed cases in North Rhine-Westphalia.Germany’s most populous state emerged as a hotspot after an infected couple attended carnival celebrations there, infecting dozens of people.Carmaker BMW confirmed on Monday that one of its employees in Munich has tested positive for the virus.Staff who have had close contact with the man have been asked to self-quarantine for 14 days, a spokeswoman said, and affected areas have been sealed off and disinfected.Amid growing fears over contagion, disinfectants, hand sanitisers and other protective products have sold out in many German shops.In Lower Saxony, 1,200 protective face masks were stolen from a hospital in the town of Sulingen near Bremen, news agency DPA reported, citing local police.The hospital reported the theft after a stock check revealed that the masks were missing from a storage room. They were probably stolen on Wednesday or Thursday last week, police said.With panic setting in, security at Bundesliga football club RB Leipzig threw out a group of Japanese fans, forcing the team to apologise on Monday.The group were removed from the stadium by security about 10 minutes into the game against Bayer Leverkusen on Sunday.The club said its security had made a “mistake” after being asked to carry out extra checks on people from potential risk areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-coronavirus-outbreak-angela-merkel-s-minister-refuses-her-a-handshake/story-O6DCgzrDHIc9yigqmdLn1I.html
03-03-2020||World||WHO says world in ‘uncharted territory’ as US coronavirus toll rises||The world has entered uncharted territory in its battle against the deadly coronavirus, the UN health agency warned, as new infections dropped dramatically in China on Tuesday but surged abroad with the US death toll rising to six.Globally, the virus has killed more than 3,100 people and infected over 90,000 even as a clear shift in the crisis emerges, with nine times as many cases recorded outside China as inside, according to the WHO.China has imposed draconian quarantines and travel restrictions to keep large swathes of the population indoors for weeks, a strategy that appears to have paid off as new cases have been falling this month.While Italy has locked down towns, other countries have stopped short of imposing mass quarantines and instead have discouraged large gatherings, delayed sporting events and banned arrivals from virus-hit nations.South Korea, Iran and Italy have emerged as major COVID-19 hotspots, which is believed to have started at a market that sold wild animals in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.South Korea, the biggest cluster outside China, approached 5,000 cases on Tuesday as 477 new infections were reported, with two more fatalities taking its death toll to 28.“The entire country has entered a war with the infectious disease,” South Korean President Moon Jae-in said.China is even importing infections now, with 13 so far, including eight Chinese nationals who had worked at the same restaurant in northern Italy’s Lombardy region.“We are in uncharted territory,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Monday.“We have never before seen a respiratory pathogen that is capable of community transmission, but which can also be contained with the right measures.”Community transmission means infections within a population are not imported from another virus-hit area.The United States is now facing a potential epidemic, with six people dying in the northwestern state of Washington, where officials warned residents the battle against the disease was shifting from containment to mitigation. “The risk for all of us of becoming infected will be increasing,” said Jeff Duchin, a health officer in King County where five of the deaths occurred. The county has more than two million residents and is home to Seattle, a major commercial and transportation hub in the Pacific Northwest region.- US eyes treatment -The White House, which has been accused of downplaying the threat from the virus, continued to strike a bullish tone.Vice President Mike Pence declared that a treatment “could literally be available by this summer, or early fall”.He was likely referring to remdesivir, an antiviral drug developed by the pharmaceutical firm Gilead that has already been used to treat one US patient and was moving toward two expansive final stage trials in Asia.Pence also announced American pharmaceuticals were forming a consortium to fight the virus, and that South Korea and Italy would screen all their airline passengers bound for the US.Despite its world-class hospitals and cutting-edge research, the US is viewed as vulnerable to an epidemic because of glaring disparities in healthcare availability, with nearly 28 million people without coverage.- China cases down -China reported 125 new cases on Tuesday, its lowest daily increase in six weeks, with all but 11 infections in Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital.The nationwide death toll rose to 2,943 with 31 more deaths, all in Hubei.Chinese officials have touted progress in the battle against the epidemic, which has hammered the world’s second-largest economy and threatened to cut into global growth.Stock markets tanked last week but rebounded on Monday after governments and central banks said they would step in if needed to soften the blow.Australia’s central bank slashed interest rates to a record low on Tuesday.Finance ministers and central bank chiefs from G7 countries will hold talks on the issue on Tuesday.- Hotspots elsewhere -UN medical experts arrived in Iran on Monday to help tackle the world’s second-deadliest coronavirus outbreak, with 66 fatalities and more than 1,500 infections.China has also sent experts to Iran, while Germany, France and Britain have pledged emergency medical supplies including testing equipment, body suits and gloves.In Italy, tourist hotpots including the Duomo in Milan reopened to visitors but access was limited to avoid overcrowding.Italy, Europe’s worst-affected country with around 1,700 infections, said Monday its deaths from the virus had jumped 18 to 52.The WHO says the virus appears to particularly hit people over the age of 60 and those already weakened by other illnesses. Its mortality rate is between two and five percent -- higher than the seasonal flu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-says-world-in-uncharted-territory-as-us-coronavirus-toll-rises/story-aievSajAEQAjVxiQ1OpUeK.html

For #COVID19, we encourage you to take necessary precautions, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),” she said.“We at @CMSGov know that #healthcare providers & staff have their patients’ best interests at heart, & it’s incredibly important that they continue following the safety guidelines laid out by CMS & the @CDCGov,” she said.According to the World Health Organisation, there are 89,527 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 3,056 deaths reported globally in 67 countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-american-seema-verma-named-key-member-of-doanld-trump-s-covid-19-task-force/story-k9WrreDkociWvObRpf4g3N.html
03-03-2020||World||Handshake, kiss on cheek? No thanks; global greeting habits change due to coronavirus||Say no to a handshake, refuse every peck on the cheek and definitely avoid hugging. Instead, try a direct gaze, or maybe a hand gesture.Around the world people are changing their habits at work, home and in worship to reduce the risk of contracting the new coronavirus and prevent it from spreading any further.AFP looks at changes in behaviour due to the coronavirus, which has killed more than 3,000 worldwide.CHINAIn Beijing, the capital of the country where the outbreak began, red hoardings tell people not to shake hands but to join their own hands together in a sign of greeting.Loudspeakers tell people to make the traditional gong shou gesture -- a fist in the opposite palm -- to say hello.FRANCENewspapers have been filled with advice on how to replace kissing on the cheek -- an everyday greeting in France, even between people who have only just met -- and handshaking, a common formality at work.Etiquette expert Philippe Lichtfus, who has been widely cited in the media, says handshakes are a relatively recent development that began in the Middle Ages.He says simply looking into a person’s eyes can suffice as a greeting.BRAZILBrazil’s health ministry has recommended that citizens not share metal straws used to consume the caffeine-rich South American drink mate, also known as chimarrao.Meanwhile a kiss -- even if not on the mouth -- is totally advised against as a greeting.GERMANY In a sign of the times, Germany’s Interior Minister Horst Seehofer rebuffed Chancellor Angela Merkel’s attempt to shake hands with him on Monday, smiling and keeping both his hands to himself.They both laughed and Merkel threw her hand up in the air before taking a seat.SPAINThe outbreak could hit one of Spain’s most cherished traditions -- the kissing of sculptures of the Virgin Mary in the week leading up to Easter.With just a month to go before the week starts, the ritual could be banned. “It is one of the measures that is on the table,” said national health official Fernando Simon.During the holy week, the faithful queue up to kiss the hands or feet of sculptures of Mary and the saints, seeking their protection.ROMANIARomania’s Martisor festival marks the beginning of spring when talismanic strings and flowers are handed out, often from men to women.But the government has passed on a message to people urging them to hand over the flowers and talismans without the accompanying kiss. “Let’s give the flowers but not the kiss,” said Nelu Tataru, state secretary at the health ministry.POLANDIn Poland, one of Europe’s most Catholic countries, the faithful are allowed to take “spiritual communion” instead of consuming the communal bread -- or it can be taken in the hands rather than the mouth.The faithful have also been asked not to dip their hands in holy water when going in and out of the church and instead make the sign of the cross.IRANIs the footshake the new handshake?In Iran, where 66 people have been killed by the virus, a video has gone viral showing three friends meeting -- hands in their pockets, with two of them wearing masks -- tapping their feet against each other as a greeting.A similar video in Lebanon shows singer Ragheb Alama and comedian Michel Abou Sleiman tapping their feet against each other while making kissing noises with their mouths.NEW ZEALANDSome educational institutions in New Zealand have temporarily abandoned the Maori greeting known as the hongi -- which involves two people pressing their noses together.Wellington polytechnic WelTec said that instead of staff greeting new students with a hongi, its welcome ceremony would instead include a waiata, or Maori song.AUSTRALIANew South Wales Health Minister Brad Hazzard urged Australians to kiss with caution and suggested a pat on the back instead of a handshake.“It’s a very Australian thing to put your hand out to shake hands, for example. I would be suggesting to the community... it’s time that Aussies actually gave each other a pat on the back for the time being -- no handshaking,” he said.“There are other things that can be done -- I’m not going to say don’t kiss, but certainly you could be exercising a degree of care and caution with who you choose to kiss.”UAEThe United Arab Emirates, as well as Qatar, are advising citizens to stop the traditional “nose to nose” greeting.The UAE also said that people shouldn’t shake hands or kiss. Greet each other “by waving only”, it said.UNITED STATESNBA stars have been given a series of recommendations including that players interacting with fans should bump fists rather than high-five and avoid taking items such as pens, balls and jerseys to autograph, ESPN reported.Some players have already taken steps to limit their exposure to the virus. Portland Trail Blazers star C.J. McCollum said he was no longer signing autographs because of the outbreak.“Make sure y’all washing y’all hands with soap for 20 or more seconds & covering ya mouths when you cough,” McCollum wrote on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/handshake-kiss-on-cheek-no-thanks-global-greeting-habits-change-due-to-coronavirus/story-e67scCxdn8BitnFS7xl1fO.html
03-03-2020||World||Sri Lankan Parliament dissolved, elections on April 25||Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa dissolved parliament late on Monday, and the election commission announced a general election for April 25.Rajapaksa - a former defence secretary - won the presidency last November and named his elder brother Mahinda Rajapaksa as interim Prime Minister.The election could help the Rajapaksas, known for the brutal defeat of separatist Tamil rebels, to strengthen their hold over the island of 22 million people.The president is empowered by Sri Lanka’s constitution to dissolve parliament any time after it completes four-and-a-half years of its five-year term - which it did on Monday.The new parliament will meet on May 14, the election commission said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sri-lankan-parliament-dissolved-elections-on-april-25/story-qkVWPKjcJAQDX2E75P40kL.html

An officer cut the tape off the dog’s snout and gave it water. Rescuers named the dog Chance.A crime scene technician collected the tape that had been around Chance’s mouth, and tips from the community led investigators to Thompson, officials said. Forensic testing later matched Thompson’s fingerprints and DNA to the tape removed from the dog’s mouth.After the dog’s recovery, Lee County Sheriff Carmine Marceno adopted and deputized Chance. The canine is now part of the sheriff office’s Community Relations Bureau.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/florida-man-sentenced-to-5-years-of-probation-taping-dog-s-mouth-leaving-it-dehydrated-malnourished/story-WaDNf0yQvSjT9ZvLxbYe7N.html
03-03-2020||World||‘Get it done’: US President Trump to drug companies on coronavirus cure||US President Donald Trump sought to show his personal engagement in the fight against coronavirus, meeting with drug company executives on Monday to elicit promises of new medicines and announcing he’ll visit federal health agencies later in the week.At the White House meeting, executives from Gilead Sciences Inc., Johnson & Johnson, GlaxoSmithKline Plc, Sanofi, Pfizer Inc. and other manufacturers told Trump they were making rapid progress on vaccines and antivirals to combat the coronavirus, which has infected about 100 people in the country and killed six.The manufacturers said they hope to have antiviral treatments ready within months and vaccines by next year. Gilead Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel O’Day told Trump that his company may test a promising antiviral in Washington State, where all six deaths from the virus have occurred.“It’s a very optimistic meeting. I didn’t realize you were that far advanced,” Trump said. “Get it done. We need it.”Vice President Mike Pence said Trump will visit the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, on Tuesday and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta later this week. At a campaign rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Monday evening, Trump promised that “we’re working hard on it and we’re going to come up with some really great solutions.“We’re going to reduce the severity of what’s happening, the duration of the virus,” Trump said. “We will bring these therapies to market as rapidly as possible.”Airport ScreeningsPence said at a briefing for reporters at the White House that South Korea has begun screening all passengers bound for the U.S. from any of their airports for infection. Italy will implement similar screening within 12 hours, Pence said.The exit screening will entail “multiple temperature checks in the airports for people before they are boarding,” Pence said at a briefing for reporters with federal health officials.The U.S. has restricted travel from China and Iran to prevent infected people from entering the country. Asked if those restrictions would be expanded, Pence said “the president was very clear we’re going to follow the facts and listen to the experts every step of the way.”“The American people should know that we are saying you should not travel to certain sections of Italy and South Korea,” Pence said. “We’ll allow the caseload in those countries to define” that guidance is expanded.The Washington deaths have been centered around a nursing home near Seattle in Kirkland, where there are a large number of suspected patients. In total, there are at least 18 cases in the state, with at least 14 in King County and four in Snohomish County.A top US disease expert said the coronavirus is likely becoming a pandemic, and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said he expects more cases after the state identified its first patient.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/get-it-done-us-president-trump-to-drug-companies-on-coronavirus-cure/story-uAMj11c4vddB6Qj47OekAM.html
03-03-2020||World||Coronavirus toll nears 3,000 mark in China||Chinese health authorities on Tuesday said 31 new deaths were reported across the mainland until Monday midnight, pushing the toll to 2943 dead in the ongoing Covid-19 outbreak.At least 125 new cases were also reported of the disease with the total infection number soaring to 80,151, the national health commission (NHC) said on Tuesday.Globally, the escalating epidemic has now killed more than 3,000 people and sickened more than 89,000 with the vast majority of cases in China.While the number of new cases recorded daily in China has now declined daily for days, the pathogen continues spreading fast in South Korea, Japan, Iran and Italy, prompting increased travel warnings and restrictions.Cases have been discovered in more than 70 countries.Most of the 125 new cases – 114 – in China were reported from the epicentre of the central Chinese province of Hubei and its locked down capital, Wuhan, where the first case of this new strain of coronavirus was first discovered late last year.“The Hubei province reported 114 new cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia on Mar 2, with 31 new deaths and 2,410 cases of recovery. The total number of infections in the province climbed to 67,217 with 36,167 recovered and 2,834 dead,” the NHC said.While the epidemic situation is showing signs of improvement in China, hundreds of millions of people across the country continue to face some form restrictions on their movements, part of an unprecedented effort to isolate the pathogen and prevent human-to-human transmission.Scientists in China and elsewhere are continuing to grapple with the new strain of the virus.Authorities in Hefei, in eastern China’s Anhui province, reported a case on Monday who showed no symptoms, forcing 177 people to be put into quarantine.The man, surnamed Xu 43, is a worker in a local plastic products company. He was reported by a local hospital, according to the Hefei health commission’s website. “Test results of the 177 close contacts have turned out to be negative so far. The results on another 269 workers in the same factory where Xu works are also negative,” the NHC was quoted as saying by the state media. The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Monday that the spread of Covid-19 in South Korea, Italy, Iran and Japan has become the greatest concern.South Korea has so far reported more than 4,200 cases and 22 deaths, meaning it has more than half of all cases outside China, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a daily briefing.In Italy, the death toll has risen to 52, with 1,835 cases confirmed until Monday.In Japan, as of Monday, the number of confirmed cases had risen to more than 960, with over 700 of them coming from the virus-hit Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined in the port city of Yokohama.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-toll-nears-3-000-mark-in-china/story-yop0RqZ2Q777PpJmcTOgXN.html
03-03-2020||World||Netanyahu ahead in Israeli election, but still lacking governing majority||Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu led on Tuesday in a cliffhanger election in Israel, but was still short of a governing majority in a third national ballot in less than a year, exit polls showed.On the basis of initial projections by Israel’s three main television channels, Netanyahu, head of the right-wing Likud party, claimed victory in Monday’s vote over his main challenger, former armed forces chief Benny Gantz of the centrist Blue and White.Updated exit polls, however, showed Netanyahu two seats short of a majority in Israel’s parliament, a gap signalling possible deadlock, with actual results trickling in throughout Tuesday.A win for Netanyahu, 70, after inconclusive ballots in April and September, would be testimony to the political durability of Israel’s longest-serving leader, who fought the latest campaign under the shadow of a looming corruption trial.It would also pave the way for Netanyahu to make good on his pledge to annex, after the election, Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank, and the region’s Jordan Valley, under a peace plan presented by U.S. President Donald Trump. Palestinians have rejected the proposal, saying it was killing their dream of establishing a viable state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, territory Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war.Israel’s three main TV channels initially projected that Likud and like-minded parties would capture 60 of parliament’s 120-seats.In their updated exit polls, Channels 11, 12 and 13 dropped the figure to 59, potentially making Netanyahu’s coalition-building task harder.During an acrimonious campaign which focused more on character than on policy, right-wing and religious parties had pledged to join a Likud-led government.Netanyahu campaigned vigorously on his strongman “security-first” platform, familiar to Israeli voters over decades, and his loyal base of blue-collar voters has stood firmly behind him throughout, seemingly unfazed by his imminent trial.“What a joyous night,” a beaming Netanyahu told a cheering crowd in a speech at Likud’s election headquarters in Tel Aviv. “This victory is especially sweet, because it is a victory against all odds ... We turned lemons into lemonade.”Gantz, in an address at his party’s election headquarters, stopped short of conceding defeat, saying the election could result in another deadlock.“I will tell you honestly, I understand and share the feeling of disappointment and pain because it is not the result we wanted,” he said. A Likud spokesman said he expected Netanyahu would manage to gain a governing majority and establish a coalition government by getting lawmakers from the opposing camp to cross sides. “There will be defectors,” Jonatan Urich told Channel 12 News.CRIMINAL CHARGESNetanyahu’s re-election bid has been complicated since the last election by his indictment on charges of bribery, breach of trust and fraud over allegations he granted state favours worth millions of dollars to Israeli media barons in return for favourable press coverage, and that he wrongfully received gifts. The first trial of a sitting prime minister in Israel is due to begin on March 17. Netanyahu denies any wrongdoing.During the campaign, Gantz termed Netanyahu “the defendant”, accusing him of seeking to retain power to promote legislation that would bar authorities from putting a serving prime minister on trial.Netanyahu has portrayed Gantz, 60, as a “coward”, saying he would need Arab politicians’ support in parliament to form a government and that they would tie his hands.The exit polls showed Likud taking between 36 and 37 parliamentary seats versus 32 to 34 for Blue and White - a gap that would make it far harder for Gantz to find a path to putting together a governing coalition.In the previous election, in September, Blue and White edged past Likud, taking 33 seats to its rival’s 32, but Gantz, like Netanyahu, was unable to put together a ruling coalition.“While we need to wait for the final results, there is no doubt that Prime Minister Netanyahu has won a significant political mandate from the Israeli people,” said Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute.“Israelis voiced their support for the man they perceive to have brought them security and prosperity,” he said.In the final days of the campaign, opinion polls had forecast further deadlock, but turnout was high, at 71 percent, despite concerns about the spread of the new coronavirus.Voters under home-quarantine, such as those who have recently travelled back to Israel from coronavirus hot spots, voted at special polling stations wearing face masks and gloves.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/netanyahu-ahead-in-israeli-election-but-still-lacking-governing-majority/story-kFYEEC2vngdW6jVybCFVlL.html
03-03-2020||World||Coronavirus treatments could be available by summer, says US vice president Mike Pence||The number of US deaths from the novel coronavirus rose to six on Monday, all in the state of Washington, officials said, signalling the contagion has taken root in the Pacific Northwest.Vice President Mike Pence announced a treatment for the disease could be available by summer or early fall, but that a vaccine was farther off.Pence, the administration’s pointman for the crisis, also said the government was moving to screen 100 percent of passengers flying in from Italy and South Korea, two serious virus hot zones.Five of the six American fatalities have been from King county, the most populous in Washington state and home to Seattle, a city of more than 700,000 people. The sixth victim was from neighboring Snohomish county, officials said.“The risk for all of us of becoming infected will be increasing,” said Jeff Duchin, a health officer in King County.“Although most of the cases will be mild or moderate, the infection can cause serious illness and there’s a potential for many people to become ill at the same time.” The state reported four new cases, three from the same nursing home, taking the total number of US cases to more than 90 -- about half of which were people repatriated from either China or a virus-stricken cruise ship off Japan.Dow Constantine, the top official in King County, said his office was in talks to purchase a motel in which to place people who required isolation, adding: “We have to move to a new stage in the fight to contain, mitigate and manage this outbreak.” Pence told reporters at the White House that treatments “could literally be available by this summer, or early fall.” He was likely referring to the drug remdesivir, an antiviral drug developed by the pharmaceutical firm Gilead that has already been used to treat one US patient and was moving toward two final stage expansive clinical trials in Asia.There are numerous vaccines and treatments under development, but remdesivir is the closest to market availability.Pence added that US pharmaceutical companies had formed a consortium to work together and share information to develop these drugs.New travel protocols “will ensure that anyone traveling on a direct flight to the United States of America receives multiple screenings at all airports in Italy and South Korea,” he said.Italy has had 1,700 cases and South Korea has had 4,000.The United States is also drastically expanding its diagnostic efforts after coming under fire for not testing enough.“The estimates that we’re getting from industry right now, by the end of this week close to a million tests will be able to be performed,” said Food and Drug Administration chief Stephen Hahn.In New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo warned it was “inevitable” that the virus would spread in the global financial hub after its first confirmed case was detected in a health care worker who had visited Iran.“There is no doubt that there will be more cases. This is New York -- we’re a gateway to the world,” Cuomo told reporters.“People are going to test positive, not just one or two or three or five, there will be many who test positive,” he added.Cuomo said the 39-year-old woman who tested positive at the weekend had mild symptoms and was recovering in isolation at home. Her husband is however expected to test positive as well.Globally, more than 3,100 people have died as a result of the virus, the vast majority of them in China. More than 90,000 people have been infected, with cases registered in more than 60 countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-treatments-could-be-available-by-summer-says-us-vice-president-mike-pence/story-07e862QiEzuQpCiTRwmayO.html
03-03-2020||World||Twitter advises 5,000 global employees to work from home||Twitter Inc. is “strongly encouraging” its almost 5,000 global employees to work from home due to concerns over the spread of the Covid-19 coronavirus, the company said Monday.The social media company made the suggestion as part of a blog update one day after it suspended all non-critical travel for workers, including pulling out of the South by Southwest conference scheduled for later this month in Austin, Texas.Twitter says it’s mandatory for employees in Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea to work from home, but that other offices will remain open for those who choose or need to come in. “We are working to make sure internal meetings, all hands, and other important tasks are optimized for remote participation,” the company wrote on its blog.Twitter’s policy on working from home is a step beyond what most companies in the U.S. are doing as the virus spreads. Many, including AT&T Inc. and Citigroup Inc., have restricted international travel, especially to Asia. Others including Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google have postponed or cancelled conferences in the U.S., and Facebook joined Twitter Monday in pulling out of South by Southwest. But Twitter’s suggestion for remote work is more reminiscent of what companies did in Asia as the virus swept the region.That’s probably because Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey is a big proponent of remote work, and has already announced plans to spend as much as six months working from Africa in 2020. “While this is a big change for us, we have already been moving toward a more distributed workforce that’s increasingly remote,” Twitter wrote Monday.Square Inc., the other public company that Dorsey leads, is also asking employees to work from home. On Monday, Square executive Aaron Zamost wrote in a tweet that the company is implementing a “strongly encouraged work-from-home policy.”A handful of Twitter workers tweeted praise for the decision, applauding Dorsey for prioritizing employee health. Many of their tweets included the hashtag #webackjack, doubling as support for a CEO under attack from activist investors who may try to replace him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-advises-5-000-global-employees-to-work-from-home/story-wHuyBAQxszbC1wu7v6GvXK.html
03-03-2020||World||Taliban end partial truce as Afghan violence resumes||The Taliban called an abrupt end to a partial truce on Monday, just two days after signing a deal with the United States that was meant to bring peace at last to Afghanistan.In the southern province of Kandahar, considered the Taliban’s heartland, fighting broke out in at least in two districts.“They started attacking five of our posts in Panjwahi and Maiwand,” local police chief Sultan Mohammad Hakimi told AFP. “Fighting is ongoing.”ALSO WATCH | US-Taliban pact: Why India needs to be watchful and wary | HT Deep DiveThe Taliban ordered its fighters to recommence attacks against Afghan army and police forces, apparently ending an official “reduction in violence” that had seen a dramatic drop in bloodshed and given Afghans a welcome taste of relative calm.The partial truce between the US, the insurgents and Afghan forces lasted for the week running up to the signing of the US-Taliban accord in Doha on Saturday, and was extended over the weekend.“The reduction in violence... has ended now and our operations will continue as normal,” Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told AFP.“As per the (US-Taliban) agreement, our mujahideen will not attack foreign forces but our operations will continue against the Kabul administration forces.”The Taliban’s military commission circulated instructions for fighters to resume operations, according to a document that an insurgent provided to AFP.Soon after, an Afghan army commander told AFP the Taliban were attacking military positions in the northwest province of Badghis. At least one soldier was killed.But the Taliban denied responsibility for a bomb blast at a football ground in Khost in eastern Afghanistan, where three brothers were killed.President Ashraf Ghani said Sunday he would continue the partial truce at least until talks between Afghan officials and the Taliban kick off, supposedly on March 10, though he angered the militants by rejecting a prisoner swap component in the deal.Fawad Aman, a defence ministry spokesman, said Monday the government was “checking to see if (the truce) had ended”.The United States cautioned that an immediate halt to violence had not been expected.“The Taliban is not a monolithic group, there’s multiple terrorist organisations operating,” General Mark Milley, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, said in Washington.“To think that (violence) is going to go to zero, immediately -- that’s probably not going to be the case.”The US has previously said it would defend Afghan partners if they come under attack.‘Violence is leverage’The Doha deal includes a commitment to swap 5,000 Taliban prisoners held by the Afghan government in return for 1,000 captives, but Ghani said the US had no authority to negotiate such an exchange.“Ghani’s stand shows that the Americans hadn’t done the groundwork before signing the agreement,” a Taliban source in Pakistan said.Analyst Michael Kugelman from the Wilson Center think-tank said he was not surprised the Taliban were on the offensive again.“Remember, violence is leverage for the Taliban. It won’t easily give it up,” he tweeted.“And now it’s exploiting that leverage to strengthen its bargaining position going into the intra-Afghan dialogue, when (and if) it begins.”Since the deal signing, the Taliban have been publicly claiming “victory” over the US.Under the terms of the deal, foreign forces will quit Afghanistan within 14 months, subject to Taliban security guarantees and a pledge by the insurgents to hold talks with Kabul.While supporters of the accord say it marks a critical first step toward peace, many Afghans fear it amounts to little more than a US capitulation that will ultimately see the insurgents return to power.In the eastern province of Laghman, thousands of locals and jubilant Taliban fighters massed on Monday to celebrate what they called their “defeat of the US”.They also vowed to continue operations against the Afghan government until an “Islamic system” of government is restored. The Taliban ruled most of Afghanistan from 1996-2001 under an extreme interpretation of Islam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-end-partial-truce-as-afghan-violence-resumes/story-QplB3fIXKjYDHCCD96kR6M.html
03-03-2020||World||India’s big Bangladesh outreach during Bangabandhu Mujibur Rahman’s centenary||Amid concerns in Dhaka about the potential fallout of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and a possible all-India National Register of Citizens (NRC), and the cancellation of the fourth high-level visit from Bangladesh to New Delhi in three months, India on Monday sought to reassure Bangladesh these are internal matters with no implications for the neighbouring country.The assurance, given by foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla on his maiden visit to Bangladesh after taking office, marks an important step in what will be an important month for bilateral ties. Shringla is in Dhaka to prepare the ground for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Bangladesh on March 17, where the PM will deliver the keynote address at the opening of celebrations marking the birth centenary of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the father of current PM Sheikh Hasina.Besides the government’s diplomatic outreach, which is based on both rewinding to historical links and current shared concerns, this month will witness an admittedly unrelated, but crucial, bipartisan message from India about the importance of ties with Bangladesh.Dhaka has invited former president Pranab Mukherjee to address a special session of the Bangladesh Parliament on March 22, and Congress president Sonia Gandhi to attend the beginning of the 50th Independence Day celebrations on March 26. The Bangla-speaking former president has deep ties with the entire political spectrum in Bangladesh and is a widely respected figure. Hasina also shares close links with the Nehru-Gandhi family, going back to Indira Gandhi’s support for her party, the Awami League, and the war of liberation in Bangladesh in 1971. Whether Mukherjee or Gandhi would indeed visit could not be confirmed. But the current churn in the relationship is primarily due to the controversial citizenship law, the NRC process in Assam, and the possibility of a nationwide NRC, which the government has clarified is not on the agenda yet. Hasina has raised the NRC and citizenship issues with her Indian counterpart twice after senior BJP leaders spoke about deporting all people not included in the register in Assam. Hasina has also questioned the need for India’s CAA, which has sparked disquiet in Bangladesh. Foreign secretary Shringla addressed these issues during a speech at the think tank Bangladesh Institute for International Studies (BIIS), attended by diplomats, academics and Gawher Rizvi, international affairs adviser to Hasina. Shringla cited the Supreme Court-mandated updating of the NRC in Assam and said it was “inevitable that events in each other’s countries create ripples across the border — irrespective of whether there is real justification”. He said: “Let me clearly state here what our leadership has repeatedly confirmed at the highest level to the government of Bangladesh: this is a process that is entirely internal to India. Therefore there will be no implications for the government and people of Bangladesh. You have our assurance on that count.” Shringla’s comments came close on the heels of the cancellation at the last minute of a visit to New Delhi by a Bangladeshi parliamentary delegation led by Speaker Shirin Chaudhury. The announcement was made late on Sunday, hours before the delegation was to leave for India.Reports have linked the cancellation of at least four high-level Bangladeshi visits, including that of the Speaker, to the controversy around the citizenship law. A statement issued by Bangladesh Parliament secretariat ‪on Sunday night, however, attributed the cancellation of the Speaker’s visit to her involvement in preparations for the birth centenary of Mujibur Rahman.Writing in The Daily Star newspaper, columnist Tasneem Tayeb said the Indian government must now demonstrate strong political will to root out factors creating rifts among the people and steer the economy back on a growth trajectory.Shringla also addressed what he described as “uninformed speculation” about New Delhi’s position on the Rohingya refugee crisis. India, he said, appreciates Bangladesh’s decision to offer shelter to nearly one million displaced people and will work for the speedy repatriation of the Rohingya. “As the only country that is an actual neighbour of both Bangladesh and Myanmar, we are committed to offering the fullest support for any mutually acceptable solution that will enable the earliest possible return of displaced persons to their homes in Rakhine State and to a life of dignity.” Shringla noted India is ready to provide more assistance following the five tranches of aid to relief camps through the Bangladesh government, and is investing in the socio-economic development of Rakhine. There is “no difference between India and Bangladesh” in addressing the humanitarian problem and New Delhi encourages stakeholders to lower the rhetoric and find practical and pragmatic solutions, he added. India is looking forward to Modi’s visit to Bangladesh later this month “because of the priority the Prime Minister attaches to this relationship” and since Mujibur Rahman is equally revered in India, Shringla said. In an apparent bid to counter criticism in Dhaka of Prime Minister Hasina’s efforts to forge stronger ties with New Delhi, Shringla said India will “always seek the closest possible ties with Bangladesh”. In an acknowledgement of Dhaka’s concerns, Shringla also said both sides “could and should do much more [for] the management of our shared river waters”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-s-big-bangladesh-outreach-during-bangabandhu-mujibur-rahman-s-centenary/story-cFTdQec8u8cj4qQLFq2tJI.html
