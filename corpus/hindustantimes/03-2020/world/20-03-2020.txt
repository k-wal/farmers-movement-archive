The defence ministry put the death toll at 17.The government earlier on Thursday said it was ordering its forces to switch to an “active defence posture” as Taliban attacks continued.“This heinous act of the Taliban is a clear example of their commitment for continued violence and against the Afghan peace process,” Sediq Sediqqi, spokesman for the Afghan president, said on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-military-base-stormed-27-security-personnel-killed/story-ObQ9XkM6QuCCmd6revNkML.html

Sections of London’s transport network have been closed, while 20,000 military personnel are on stand-by to assist civil authorities.The London boroughs with the most cases are Southwark (82), Lambeth (81), Westminster (78), Wandsworth (75), Brent (66), Kensington and Chelsea (57), Harrow (56) and Ealing (53). Brent, Harrow and Ealing are home to many members of the Indian diaspora.New UK measures include asking thousands of recently retired doctors and nurses to return to the National Health Service to help deal with the pandemic. Chancellor Rishi Sunak is due to announce more financial support across the economy.Queen Elizabeth, 93, moved from Buckingham Palace to Windsor Castle, where Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, 98, joined her from the Sandringham estate. The monarch said the UK is “entering a period of great concern and uncertainty”.In a statement, she said: “Our nation’s history has been forged by people and communities coming together to work as one. We are all being advised to change our normal routines and regular patterns of life for the greater good of the communities we live in and, in particular, to protect the most vulnerable within them”.“At times such as these, I am reminded that our nation’s history has been forged by people and communities coming together to work as one, concentrating our combined efforts with a focus on the common goal.”She added: “Many of us will need to find new ways of staying in touch with each other and making sure that loved ones are safe. I am certain we are up to that challenge.

20-03-2020||World||Covid-19 update: China reports no new coronavirus cases for second day||For the second consecutive day, China reported no new case of coronavirus (Covid-19) domestic transmission, a sign some experts said, that indicates the country has passed the outbreak peak.China’s fight against the coronavirus, however, continues at the borders. It is a focused battle against overseas travellers, some of whom could be returning to the country with the disease, and have the potential to spread it in communities.Until Thursday midnight, at least 228 cases of overseas Covid-19 cases had been reported, the majority in Beijing.Beijing is also laying down the protocol of how to prevent the spread. It has implemented step-by-step measures to sift through incoming overseas travellers, check them for infection, separate the infected and dispatch all to 14-day self-paid quarantines, mostly at government-designated hotels.Following Beijing, other cities are implementing similar protocols.“Several airports in China, including Beijing and Guangzhou, have introduced new procedures for incoming travellers from overseas, including medical screening on arrival. The procedures may take place at the airport terminal itself or in designated screening centres, and takes around nine hours on average to complete,” the Indian embassy in Beijing said in a statement on Friday.The process begins soon after disembarkation.Incoming passengers need to file a health declaration before they are allowed to enter the quarantine route where they have their body temperatures checked. In Beijing, passengers are then taken to the China International Exhibition Centre, a massive exhibition complex some 6 km from the airport, in government buses for registration and the second round of physical checks.Those found to display no symptoms at the exhibition centre, and are travelling to other cities in China, are escorted by their own city government personnel to airports or train stations to continue their journeys. (They will be quarantined for 14 days at their final destination.)It is different for those who intend to stay in Beijing. “On rigorous assessment and screening, people aged 70 and above, minors aged 14 and pregnant women and those with underlying conditions who are assessed as not suitable for quarantine at designated places may be allowed to stay at home for observation. These are the only exemptions from 14 days quarantine at a Chinese government-designated location for overseas travellers entering Beijing,” the Indian embassy statement added.“Those who meet the criteria for home observation should apply for such observation to their residential communities prior to entering China. Those who fail to submit the application in advance or whose applications have not been approved will be sent to designated places for quarantine,” the statement said.According to official statements quoted by state media, Beijing has set up 149 “medical observation sites”, mostly small and medium category hotels, for overseas travellers to undergo a 14-day medical observation.The self-paid package includes a single room, daily and regular health check-ups, psychological counselling; meals have to be eaten in the room.The cost could be in the range of Rs. 2000 to Rs.5000 per day. People with infection symptoms will be transferred to Beijing Ditan Hospital for a nucleic acid test, which determines whether the swan sample contains the virus. “Ditan hospital has screened at least 1,600 passengers in the 18 days up to Tuesday morning,” local media reports said. “In preparation for a growing number of imported cases in the capital, Beijing Xiaotangshan Hospital, at the center of SARS treatment in 2003, reopened on March 16 after 17 years,” the report added. Some overseas flights with Beijing as their destination are being diverted to other Chinese cities surrounding Beijing, including Tianjin, Hohhot and Taiyuan to ease the pressure on the capital.Similar measures of quarantine are being put in place in those cities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-update-china-reports-no-new-coronavirus-cases-for-second-day/story-QqhexYSznZER7HOda0wqzM.html
20-03-2020||World||Coronavirus update: Countries ramping up efforts to contain epidemic||The Latest on the coronavirus pandemic, which has infected more than 244,500 people and killed more than 10,000. The COVID-19 illness causes mild or moderate symptoms in most people, but severe symptoms are more likely in the elderly or those with existing health problems. More than 86,000 people have recovered so far, mostly in China.Belgium receives order of masks from ChinaBelgium has received an order of 5 million protective masks from China amid fears of shortages in hospitals.The shipment was delivered early Friday at the Liege airport and placed under military surveillance.A total of 1,795 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been recorded by Belgian authorities, including 21 deaths.“The need for masks is enormous. It will ease the tension we are starting to feel in hospitals,” Luc Partoune, the CEO of Liege airport, told local media.A previous order of 5 million masks placed by Belgium was expected last week but was canceled because of a fraud investigation targeting the Turkish provider.Southeast Asia’s largest mosque in Jakarta cancels prayersThe largest mosque in Southeast Asia canceled mass prayers for the next two weeks to avoid spreading the coronavirus.The Istiqlal grand mosque in Indonesia’s capital, Jakarta, is usually packed with thousands of Muslims during Friday prayers.Imam Nasaruddin Umar says the decision was made after the Indonesian Ulema Council, the country’s highest religious authority, issued a fatwa or ruling on Monday, allowing Muslims to skip mass prayers in regions where the virus has spread “uncontrollably” until the situation returns to normal.“Prayers in congregations will be suspended in Istiqlal for the next two weeks, including Friday prayers,” Umar said in a video statement televised nationally in the world’s most populous Muslim country.“We appeal people not to hold mass prayers in other region where the coronavirus had spread until the danger for the contagion disappears,” he said.His appeal following orders from President Joko Widodo to the people in the world’s most populous Muslim nation to curb mass religious gatherings to contain the coronavirus.Indonesia has had 25 deaths from COVID-19, the most in Southeast Asia, and has 309 cases.On Friday, there were still a few people in Istiqlal. Instead of Friday prayer, they held the noon prayer congregation by practicing social distancing of one meter (yard) apart between worshippers.Most mosques in cities and districts remained out of red zones of coronavirus outbreak, are holding Friday prayers which commonly believed to be obligatory for Muslim men. They are holding prayers with a shorter sermon and the congregation to bring their own prayer mats.Voters to use masks and disposable gloves in South Korea’s parliamentary elections South Korea’s election commission says all voters will be required to wear masks and use disposable gloves at ballot booths during next month’s national parliamentary elections as preventive measures against the coronavirus.An official from the National Election Commission also said Friday that election workers will conduct temperature checks and provide separate polling places for voters with fever or respiratory symptoms.Voters will be required to stand at least a meter apart when waiting in lines and sanitize their hands and wear plastic gloves provided by election workers before entering booths.The commission will establish voting stations at hospitals and other treatment centers for COVID-19 patients who are medically isolated.Some politicians had called for the country to postpone the April 15 election, which will be a crucial moment for President Moon Jae-in’s government amid concerns about the epidemic’s impact on public health, livelihoods and industries.Japan, China and South Korea hold video conference Foreign ministers from Japan, China and South Korea held a video conference Friday and agreed to continue cooperating in their effort to fight against the coronavirus outbreak.Japanese foreign minister Toshimitsu Motegi and his counterparts, China’s Wang Yi and South Korea’s Kang Keung-wha, ensured cooperation among the three countries in their effort and agreed to hold a three-way meeting of health authorities at an early date.Motegi also proposed sharing of information on drugs and vaccine development, as well as cooperation to ensure shipment of medical supplies and emergency relief goods among the three countries.Motegi told the other ministers that Japan hopes to fully achieve the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics “as a proof of human victory against the new coronavirus,” the Japnaese foreign ministry said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-countries-ramping-up-efforts-to-contain-epidemic/story-C1yk0VBz1YzOy1cXH02B1K.html
20-03-2020||World||US, Mexico discuss halting much of cross-border travel||The United States and Mexico are working on plans to halt much of cross-border travel without disrupting trade during the coronavirus outbreak, officials said Thursday.Mexican Foreign Relations Secretary Marcelo Ebrard said he proposed steps to U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that “won’t paralyze economic activity and keep the border open to commerce and work.” He promised details on Friday.Pompeo said on Twitter that he was working closely with his Mexican counterpart “on travel restrictions that balance protecting our citizens from further transmission of #COVID19. Together, we can reduce public health risks and prioritize essential cross-border commerce and trade.”US Customs and Border Protection officials briefed business leaders Thursday on plans to prohibit nonessential travel, similar to a measure announced earlier this week on the Canadian border, said Paola Avila, chair of the Border Trade Alliance, a business group.The measure would effectively close the US to all tourist and recreational visits along the Mexican border, said Avila, who participated in a conference call with CBP officials. Administration officials said the U.S. would announce it as early as Friday, though details were still being worked out and subject to change, she said.US officials provided a long list of “essential” workers that would be unaffected going to and from their jobs, including farmworkers, restaurant and grocery store employees and bus drivers, said Avila. Mexico was preparing similar restrictions on visitors from the United States.US Homeland Security Department officials didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment late Thursday.Keeping trade flowing, as the US and Canada agreed to do, contains the economic damage. Mexico is the U.S.’s largest trading partner, just ahead of Canada. The US accounts for about 75% of Mexican exports, including autos, computers and medical devices.While halting travel for students, shoppers, families and many workers would be a major blow to border economies, the impact has already been felt.The State Department on Thursday issued a new travel alert urging Americans not to go abroad under any circumstances and to return home if they are already abroad unless they plan to remain overseas. California Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered the state’s 40 million residents to stay at home, restricting nonessential movements.“People are not crossing anyway,” said Avila, who is also the San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce vice president for international business affairs. This is the right thing to do. If you don’t have to cross, don’t.”The U.S. has also been considering whether to immediately turn back to Mexico anyone who crosses the border illegally, including asylum-seekers. President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he planned to announce such a measure “very soon,” relying on a law that says he can deny entry to people or reject cargo if the U.S. surgeon general determines there is a “serious danger” of bringing a communicable disease to the United States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-mexico-discuss-halting-much-of-cross-border-travel/story-k6MaPZ2M6yPM3Cg7BCcZuO.html
20-03-2020||World||Sri Lanka imposes nationwide curfew to combat coronavirus pandemic||Sri Lankan has imposed a nationwide curfew from Friday until Monday to combat the fast-spreading coronavirus pandemic that has claimed over 9,000 lives globally, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s office has announced. The curfew announcement comes a day after the country’s Election Commission announced the postponement of the parliamentary election which was scheduled for April 25. The Commission said a decision on the new date would be taken after March 25. The country is to be placed under a curfew with effect from 6 pm (local time) tonight until 6 am (local time) on Monday, President Rajapaksa’s office said. Although there were no reasons given for the announcement, it is believed that the government is keen to see restricted movement of the people in order to promote social distancing in the face of a looming threat posed by the COVID-19 outbreak. The national center tasked to prevent COVID-19 infections said out of the 66 confirmed cases so far, 25 were returnees from overseas. It said 22 of them were from Italy while 2 from the UK and one from India. Over 2,400 people are going through quarantine which includes 27 foreign nationals, it added. President Rajapaksa has refused to lockdown the entire country, citing economic hardships for the poor. Sri Lankan police had previously restricted the curfew to night time in the western coastal areas, a move aimed at tracking down Italy returnees who were avoiding compulsory quarantine process. The police said despite the curfew people were engaging in social activities, defying the need to maintain social distancing. Countries around the world are sealing their borders and banning travel to stop the fast-spreading COVID-19 pandemic that has claimed 9,800 lives and infected more than 232,650 people in 158 countries and territories. In view of the rising number of the novel coronavirus cases globally, Sri Lanka on Tuesday suspended all international flights arriving in the country. China with 80,967 infected cases and 3,248 deaths tops the list followed by Italy (41,035 cases and 3,405 deaths), Iran (18,304 infected cases and 1,284 deaths), Spain (19,077 infected cases and 831 deaths), Germany (15,320 infected cases and 44 deaths) and France (10,995 infected cases and 372 deaths).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sri-lanka-imposes-nationwide-curfew-to-combat-coronavirus-pandemic/story-EOd5X4IN3h6f2gsvU5Y9VP.html
20-03-2020||World||Australia hunts 2,700 cruise passengers over coronavirus fears||Australia issued an urgent call for 2,700 cruise ship passengers who disembarked in central Sydney to isolate themselves and contact authorities Friday, after four travellers tested positive for COVID-19.New South Wales authorities said they had deemed the New Zealand-bound Ruby Princess “low risk” and let passengers spill into the centre of the country’s most populous city on Thursday.They later discovered that three passengers and one of the 1,100 crew members had tested positive.The ship was on a cruise from Sydney to New Zealand when passengers fell sick and 13 were tested for flu mid-voyage.The swabs were later tested for coronavirus and four came back positive.“That obviously is a cause for us to have some concern,” said New South Wales state health minister Brad Hazzard.“There may be the possibility -- not by any means confirmed -- there may be other passengers on board that ship who could have had the COVID virus.”Passengers had “provided their emails and their phone numbers” he added, “we’re making every effort to contact” them.The ship is currently far off the coast of Sydney with the 1,100 crew aboard, including the one member of staff who tested positive.“The company that owns that Ruby Princess is managing the issue,” said Hazzard.Travellers who return from overseas or are exposed to coronavirus are expected to self-quarantine for 14 days, but some of the passengers may not yet know about the positive tests.“The very big concern, is that those people came off the cruise with no knowledge of COVID actually being on their ship,” said Hazzard. Operator Princess Cruises did not immediately respond to a request for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-hunts-2-700-cruise-passengers-over-coronavirus-fears/story-we8kIYpUIBUNeHgcqtLhSI.html
20-03-2020||World||China tries to rewrite coronavirus narrative,deflect criticism||With millions of face masks, low interest loans and teams of medical experts, China is trying to paint itself as a Good Samaritan while deflecting criticism over its initial missteps in handling the coronavirus.Beijing has showered struggling European nations with aid as part of a diplomatic charm offensive.In recent weeks, it has also donated hundreds of thousands of surgical masks and test kits to the Philippines and Pakistan, sent teams of medics to Iran and Iraq, and extended a $500 million loan to help Sri Lanka combat the virus.While COVID-19 first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December, Beijing says it has now curbed its spread, with domestic cases dwindling to zero Thursday.But as other governments now scramble to cope with the pandemic, China is sending masks, medical supplies and experts.Click here for all round coronavirus coveragePresident Xi Jinping pledged assistance to hardest-hit Italy and Spain in phone calls with their prime ministers, the official Xinhua news agency reported.Two Chinese medical teams were sent to Italy in a high-profile show of solidarity with the earliest European Union partner in Xi’s massive “Belt and Road” infrastructure project.Italy is now the second hardest-hit country in the world with more than 35,000 cases.EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Twitter this week that China would ship two million masks to Europe “immediately” and expressed her gratitude to Premier Li Keqiang.She said the EU helped China in January, by donating equipment, and tweeted: “Today, we’re grateful for China’s support.”Beijing also sent medical equipment to Serbia this week after an appeal for help.“It has turned out that without you Europe can hardly defend itself,” Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic told Beijing’s ambassador as Chinese virus tests arrived.He said the country had been waiting for its “Chinese brothers”.The EU -- of which Serbia is not a member -- announced a ban on the export of medical equipment on Sunday, a move slammed by Vucic.Xinhua said more aid and doctors from China would arrive in Serbia in the next few days.Beijing has in recent years challenged Brussels for influence in the Balkans, in particular through heavy loan-based infrastructure investment in cash-strapped countries.Other political allies which China has supported or supplied include a number of African nations.Meanwhile Jack Ma, China’s richest man, donated two million masks to be distributed across Europe, with shipments having arrived in Belgium, Spain and Italy.Another million masks bound for France left China on Wednesday.China-US tensions A front-page commentary by the state-run People’s Daily on Thursday emphasised China’s role as a “responsible major country” that willingly cooperates with other nations.It comes as Beijing and Washington are engaged in a tit-for-tat public opinion war over China’s recent mass expulsion of US journalists and President Donald Trump’s continued use of the phrase “Chinese virus” to describe the coronavirus.With the US also battling the virus on its home turf, analysts say China is rushing to reposition itself as an alternative global leader.“Now, with the US government under Trump failing to provide any meaningful international response and the EU occupied with national responses, it offers China’s government a unique opportunity to step into the empty spot,” said Marina Rudyak, an expert in Chinese foreign aid at the University of Heidelberg.By doing so, China was also trying to rewrite the COVID-19 narrative, deflecting criticism of its initial attempts to cover up the outbreak and posing as the saviour of “other countries who either delayed their response or were less prepared than China,” added Rudyak.For some European countries, the strategy appears to be working. “There are competing narratives evolving in Europe. Most people see China being responsible for this global crisis,” said Joerg Wuttke, president of the EU Chamber of Commerce in China.“But the generous humanitarian help from China will possibly swing the public opinion in Europe more in favour of China.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-tries-to-rewrite-coronavirus-narrative-deflect-criticism/story-cixjgqpqVKcrYlnc6i3UGK.html
20-03-2020||World||US fast-tracking antimalarials to treat coronavirus||The US is fast-tracking antimalarial drugs for use as a treatment against the new coronavirus, President Donald Trump said Thursday, following encouraging early results in France and China.Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have not been given a formal green light in the US to fight the pandemic, but the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said it would work with domestic makers to expand production as it studied their efficacy.The news came as Senate Republicans unveiled a $1 trillion emergency relief package to combat the economic turmoil caused by the virus -- which must now be examined by so-far skeptical Democrats, who want to include direct financial aid to individuals, before a date can be set for a vote.The two drugs mentioned Thursday are already approved for malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, and doctors in the US may prescribe any drug they believe is appropriate medically.“We’re going to be able to make that drug available almost immediately, and that’s where the FDA has been so great,” Trump told reporters, referring to both compounds.The US has recorded more than 14,000 cases of new coronavirus infection, 205 of them fatal, according to a Johns Hopkins University tracker. But authorities expect the number to rise steeply in the coming days because of increased levels of testing after initial delays.“If there is an experimental drug that is potentially available, a doctor could ask for that drug to be used in a patient. We have criteria for that and very speedy approval for that,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn.“As an example, many Americans have read studies and heard media reports about this drug chloroquine, which is an anti-malarial drug. “That’s a drug that the president directed us to take a closer look at, as to whether an expanded use approach to that could be done to actually see if that benefits patients.”Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are synthetic forms of quinine, which is found in the barks of cinchona trees of Latin America and has been used to treat malaria for centuries.Some in the wider scientific community have cautioned more research is needed to prove that they really work and are safe for COVID-19. But French drug maker Sanofi said on Wednesday it was ready to offer the French government millions of doses of hydroxychloroquine, sold under its brand name Plaquenil, in light of a “promising” study carried out by scientist Didier Raoult of the IHU Mediterranee Infection in Marseille.Raoult reported this week that after treating 24 patients for six days with Plaquenil, the virus had disappeared in all but a quarter of them. The research has not yet been peer reviewed or published, and Raoult had come under fire by some scientists and officials in his native France for potentially raising false hopes.“I’m just doing my duty, and I am happy to see that now eight or nine countries recommend chloroquine treatment for patients with this new coronavirus,” he told AFP.ENCOURAGINGSeveral clinical trials are also underway in China, where authorities have announced positive results but not yet published their data.Karine Le Roch, a professor of cell biology at the University of California, Riverside told AFP she was encouraged by recent work in France and China.“I will say there is a very small number of patients, but if the results are correct, it seems to indeed decrease the viral loads of infected patients,” she said.“It’s encouraging but we have to make sure the results are accurate and then confirm that with a larger number of patients.”Scientists understand how these alkaloid compounds work at the cellular level to fight malaria parasites -- but it’s not yet known how they are fighting the coronavirus, Le Roch added.“It’s highly possible that this compound is changing the acidity of the cells infected with the virus,” she told AFP.“And then the enzymes that are needed for the virus to replicate cannot work as efficiently as they would work without the drug.”But not everyone is convinced.Writing in the journal Antiviral Research, French scientists Franck Touret and Xavierde de Lamballerie urged caution, noting that chloroquine had been proposed several times for the treatment of acute viral diseases in humans without success, including HIV.They added that finding the right dose was crucial because “chloroquine poisoning has been associated with cardiovascular disorders that can be life-threatening.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-fast-tracking-antimalarials-to-treat-coronavirus/story-q73YPVW1yoL8VjgOgCtS6K.html

He also announced a measure to cut transport links with other Brazilian states with reported virus cases, although that needs to be ratified by federal authorities.Mexico reported its first coronavirus death -- a 41-year-old man with diabetes who died on Wednesday in Mexico City. Mexico has recorded 118 virus cases.A Mexican federal judge meanwhile ordered President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to take all preventative measures and necessary actions in order to detect infected persons in the country.Peru, which has a total of 234 confirmed cases, reported its first three deaths. Chile stimulus planChile’s stimulus plan “will strengthen our ability to face the health, economic and social needs that the coronavirus pandemic is signifying and that will probably tend to worsen in the future,” President Sebastian Pinera told a press conference.Senate speaker Adriana Munoz said the leaders of the main political parties had agreed to postpone the referendum on changing the dictatorship-era constitution from April 26 to October 25, to give the country time to deal with the virus.Health Minister Jaime Manalich announced a lockdown of Chile’s Easter Island, saying no one could enter or leave the remote Pacific island for the next two weeks.Police meanwhile said they had foiled an attempted break-out from Chile’s largest jail. Earlier this week, inmates from jails in Brazil and Venezuela managed to escape, motivated by fear that prisons are a breeding ground for the coronavirus.Chile has registered 342 cases of the virus to date.In Ecuador, Cynthia Viteri, mayor of the country’s second city Guayaquil, said she ordered vehicles to block the runway of the international airport to prevent the Spanish-operated plane from landing.The flight from Madrid, with only crew aboard, was able to land later in Quito.Ecuador has banned all flights since Monday to stop the spread of the coronavirus.Panama, which hosts Central America’s busiest airport, and Colombia both said they were suspending all international air travel for a month from Monday.Colombia’s President Ivan Duque said the shutout was necessary because some people who had entered the country had tried to avoid mandatory quarantine regulations.Colombia closed its land and sea borders on Tuesday.Bogota confinement Bogota city hall said the capital’s seven million people would face confinement from Friday to Monday as part of a trial run for a probable future quarantine.Other cities across Colombia, which has more than 100 cases of the coronavirus, were also under nighttime curfews.Meanwhile, Eduardo Bolsonaro, the lawmaker son of Brazil’s president, joined US President Donald Trump in criticizing China over the pandemic, prompting demands from Beijing for an apology.China’s embassy accused Bolsonaro of using “irresponsible words” and of having “caught a mental virus.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/latin-america-paralyzed-with-argentina-lockdown-rio-beach-closures-amid-coronavirus-crisis/story-kgwW5S3MCbtkQEzc85bBIM.html

Mission said in a statement late Thursday that “the inhuman and unlawful” U.S. sanctions are hampering efforts to prevent further spread of COVID-19 to other nations and are harming the health and lives of Iranians.“In other words, while the U.S. is trying to curb the virus internally, it is helping the spread of virus externally by undermining the professional capabilities of certain affected countries who try to combat its pandemic,” the mission said.The mission called the U.S. sanctions “tantamount to crimes against humanity,” saying they “make it virtually impossible for Iranians to import needed medicine and medical equipment.”It said a special mechanism allowing Iran to import medicine is very difficult to use because of sanctions-related “impediments” including extreme difficulty for Iran to use its financial resources abroad.SOUTH KOREA ENFORCES QUARANTINESouth Korea says it will test all passengers coming from Europe for the coronavirus starting Sunday as it strengthens border controls to prevent the illness from re-entering amid broadening outbreaks on the continent.South Korean Health Ministry official Yoon Tae-ho on Friday said the country also from Sunday will enforce 14-day quarantines on South Korean nationals returning from Europe and foreigners arriving from Europe for long-term stay in South Korea, regardless of whether they have symptoms.Yoon says the country has no immediate plans to expand such measures to passengers arriving from the United States.South Korea has already strengthened screening for all passengers arriving from abroad, requiring them to undergo temperature checks, fill in health questionnaires, provide their cellphone numbers and download an app to send daily reports about their health status to authorities.CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR IMPOSES STAY-AT-ORDERCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom has put the nation’s most populous state on a stay-at-home order.It expands to nearly 40 million people restrictions he said already applied to about half the state. He said late Thursday that the statewide restriction on any non-essential movement outside the home is needed to control the spread of the coronavirus that threatens to overwhelm the state’s medical system.Newsom earlier in the day issued the dire prediction that 56% of California’s population could contract the virus over the next eight weeks.BRAZIL BLOCKS FOREIGNERSBrazil is the latest country to block international travelers from flying in, including those coming from areas hardest hit by the new coronavirus.Foreigners coming from China, the European Union, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, United Kingdom, Japan, Malaysia, Australia and South Korea will be denied entry to the South American country for the next 30 days, starting Thursday.Several other nations in the region already have taken the measure. Brazil has confirmed 621 cases of coronavirus, with seven people dead.NORTH KOREA RELEASES 4,000 FROM QUARANTINENorth Korea says it released thousands of people from quarantine, including all but three foreigners, while maintaining a tough campaign to stem the spread of the coronavirus in the country.North Korea has not publicly confirmed a single case of the COVID-19 illness, but state media has described anti-virus efforts as a matter of “national existence.”Pyongyang’s official Korean Central News Agency on Friday said more than 4,000 people were released in the provinces of North and South Pyongan and Kangwon after health officials confirmed they no longer had symptoms.When combining the numbers from previous state media reports, it’s presumed that the North has so far released around 8,000 people from quarantine.The country had initially placed 380 foreigners under quarantine, but the KCNA says only three of them remain under medical isolation. The North earlier this month arranged a special government flight to fly out dozens of diplomats to Vladivostok, Russia.Experts say an epidemic in North Korea could have dire consequences due to the country’s poor health system and shortage of medical supplies.The country has banned foreign tourists, shut down nearly all cross-border traffic with China, intensified screening at entry points and mobilized health workers to monitor residents and isolate those with symptoms.MEXICO, US TALK BORDER COMMERCEMexico’s Foreign Relations Minister says he has held talks with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about travel restrictions at the border “that won’t paralyze economic activity, and leave the border open to commerce and workers.”Marcelo Ebrard said Thursday he would give more details tomorrow.Pompeo wrote in his Twitter account that he and Ebrard “have been working closely on travel restrictions that balance protecting our citizens from further transmission of #COVID19. Together, we can reduce public health risks and prioritize essential cross-border commerce and trade.”SOUTH KOREA REPORTS 87 NEW CASESSouth Korea has reported 87 new cases of the novel coronavirus and three more deaths, bringing its totals to 8,652 cases and 94 deaths.South Korea’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday said 316,600 people have so far been tested for the virus and 2,230 have been released from hospitals.While infections have slowed in the worst-hit city of Daegu, there’s growing concern about a steady rise in cases in the Seoul metropolitan areas, where about half of South Korea’s 51 million people live.The country has recently strengthened screening of all passengers arriving from abroad to stem the virus from re-entering amid broadening outbreaks in Europe and North America.WASHINGTON SEES CORONAVIRUS CASE SURGEThe District of Columbia has announced 32 new cases of the COVID-19 coronavirus, including an eight-year-old boy, bringing the total to 71. The new infections include a cluster of young people, with 12 identified below the age of 35.DC health officials have long predicted that the local numbers would spike as more people were tested. Earlier Thursday, they announced that a third member of the DC fire department had tested positive.Mayor Muriel Bowser has declared a state of emergency and closed all schools through the end of the month. The popular Cherry Blossom Festival has been postponed, White House and Capitol tours have been cancelled and the National Zoo, Smithsonian museum network and Kennedy Center have closed.Washington’s tally doesn’t include people who may have been infected in Washington but live in nearby northern Virginia or southern Maryland.PHILIPPINES BANS ENTRY OF FOREIGNERS INDEFINITELYThe Philippines is indefinitely banning the entry of foreigners after the government declared a state of calamity and public health emergency amid the coronavirus outbreak.The Department of Foreign Affairs said in a statement late Thursday that it is temporarily suspending visa issuances in all its foreign posts effective immediately.“This goes one imperative step forward: a total ban on incoming foreign visitors of all nationalities,” Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin said in a tweet. ”Outgoing foreign visitors should be given all the help to get out. Idiotic to detain them.”The drastic move exempts foreign government and international organization officials and their dependents as well as foreign spouses and children of Filipino citizens, the department said.CHINA STAGGERS TOWARDS NORMALSome flights to Beijing are being rerouted to regional airports to relieve pressure on the capital for screening large numbers of incoming passengers.China has not banned travelers from abroad, but Beijing and other cities are requiring that all undergo 14-day quarantines, either at home or at a government-designated facility such as a hotel or makeshift observation center.China is very slowly coming back to life, with the government saying about 80% of economic activity has been restored, although millions of workers remain stranded by travel bans.Beijing’s tourism industry is still on hold, just as it should be ramping up for the summer season. The Great Wall is largely shut and it remains forbidden to visit the Forbidden City, the ancient former palace of China’s emperors.CALIFORNIA GUN SHOP OWNER REFUSES COVID-19 ADVISORYIn Alameda County, Sheriff’s Sgt. Ray Kelley said a gun shop called Solar Tactical in Castro Valley has refused to close, despite the shelter at home order. He said officers have advised the shop to close.“We’ll start out nice,” Kelley said Thursday. “Then we’ll post a notice to close and then we will take enforcement.”The shop did not answer phone calls Thursday and did not immediately respond to messages. A message on its Facebook page said the store is now operating on an appointment-only basis and urged customers to call local police to protest the effort to close it and other gun stores.“Your 2nd Amendment right is no longer considered essential during forced shelter in place,” the shop said. “Please share and get the word out. Call your local officials, news stations, and Alameda County Sheriffs office to let them know how you feel about your 2nd Amendment rights being taken away.”WUHAN REPORTS ZERO CASESThe Chinese city of Wuhan where the virus at the heart of the global pandemic was first detected has recorded a second consecutive day with no new confirmed or suspected cases.Nationwide, a total of 39 cases were recorded Friday, the health ministry said, all of them brought from overseas. Three more deaths were also registered, bringing China’s total to 3,248, a figure surpassed on Thursday by Italy as the highest in a single nation.China still leads in overall cases, with 80,967, more than 71,000 of whom have been declared healthy and sent home.China has loosened some travel restrictions in Hubei, the province surrounding Wuhan, although its provincial border remains closed and Wuhan itself remains under lockdown. Officials say they will only lift the quarantine after Wuhan goes 14 consecutive days with no new case.WISCONSIN REPORTS FIRST FATALITIESTwo Wisconsin residents have died from the coronavirus pandemic, the first to be reported in the state.Gov. Tony Evers announced Thursday that a man in his 50s from Fond du Lac County and a man in his 90s from Ozaukee County had died. No other details about their circumstances was reported.HAWAII STATE SENATOR TESTS POSITIVEHawaii state Sen. Clarence Nishihara was informed Thursday that he tested positive for coronavirus.Nishihara is the first known Hawaii lawmaker to test positive and the first at the Hawaii State Capitol building, Senate communications spokesman Jesse Broder Van Dyke said.Senate President Ron Kouchi sent a memo recommending all Senate offices close until further notice.HAITI CONFIRMS FIRST 2 CASES OF CORONAVIRUSHaiti has confirmed its first two cases of the new coronavirus.President Jovenel Moise said the unidentified patients that tested positive for COVID-19 have been quarantined. He declined to release further details out of fear for their safety.Moise also said he would close all airports, schools, factories and seaports.The announcement comes just days after officials closed the border that Haiti and the Dominican Republic share on the island of Hispaniola.Haiti is the poorest country in the western Hemisphere, and many worry the country is not equipped to handle a possible spread of coronavirus.IMMIGRANT DETAINEES CONTINUE TO BE AT RISKSEATTLE — A federal judge has declined to order the release of immigration detainees who may be especially vulnerable to the new coronavirus because they are old or have underlying health conditions.The American Civil Liberties Union of Washington and the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project sought the release of nine detainees at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Northwest detention center in Tacoma.U.S. District Judge James L. Robart said he was aware of the gravity and rapidly evolving nature of the COVID-19 crisis, but that there is no evidence of an outbreak at the privately run jail or that the agency’s precautions are inadequate.ANOTHER AIRLINES SHUTS SHOPCompass Airlines is shutting down operations in April due to the coronavirus outbreak.A statement from the Minneapolis-based company says Compass Airlines “has made the difficult decision to cease operations, effective April 7.” According to the statement, “Radical capacity reductions left Compass without the ability to fly even minimally viable schedules.”The Star Tribune also reports that Compass’ Delta-affiliated operations will end March 31 instead of winding down later this year as scheduled.President Sara Nelson of the Association of Flight Attendants calls the shutdown “devastating.” The union represents more than 200 cabin crew members at Compass. Under parent Trans States Airlines, Compass exclusively flies in western states but kept its corporate headquarters in the Twin Cities.COVID-19 CONTINUES RAMPAGE IN WASHINGTONThe death toll in Washington state from the new coronavirus has increased to 74, and the number of cases has topped 1,300, according to state health officials.King County reported four new deaths — bringing its total to 60 — while Snohomish, Benton and Island counties each reported one death.Gov. Jay Inslee issued an order Thursday prohibiting non-urgent medical and dental procedures in an effort to secure protective equipment used by front-line health care workers. The order applies to any procedure that would require someone to wear protective gear.“We know the health care personal protective equipment supply chain in Washington has been severely disrupted by the significant increased use of such equipment worldwide,” Inslee said in a statement. “We will do all we can to protect the women and men who protect us.”TOP UN OFFICIAL DIAGNOSED WITH COVID-19UN World Food Programme Executive Director David Beasley says he has been diagnosed with COVID-19.Beasley says in a statement he began to feel ill after returning from an official visit to Canada and put himself into quarantine at his South Carolina home last Saturday.Beasley says his symptoms have been mild and he is in good spirits. He says he continues to work from home and his employees are helping him inform anyone he had contact with during his trip.Beasley has run the program since 2017 that provides food to more than 80 million starving and hungry people around the world.The 63-year-old Beasley was governor of South Carolina for four years starting in 1995.AIR NEW ZEALAND GETS GOVT BAILOUTWELLINGTON, New Zealand — New Zealand’s government is bailing out its national airline by offering more than $500 million in loans.Air New Zealand has already stopped most international routes and cut back on domestic flights due to the coronavirus outbreak. Beginning Friday, New Zealand has closed its borders to everyone but citizens and residents, ending most airline travel to the South Pacific nation.Air New Zealand said it will cut its workforce of 12,500 by 30%. The airline is 52% owned by the government, which has offered loans of 900 million New Zealand dollars ($511 million) over two years.Finance Minister Grant Robertson said that without the intervention, New Zealand was at risk of not having a national airline. New Zealand has had 28 confirmed cases of COVID-19, all connected to international travel. There have been no signs yet of a local outbreak.LOUISIANA HEALTHCARE OVERBURDENEDLouisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards told President Donald Trump that a growing number of new coronavirus cases could push the state past its capacity to deliver health care in seven days.Edwards stressed at a later news conference that the number was a “worst case scenario,” which he said was “sobering.”The number of people known to be infected with the virus in Louisiana jumped to nearly 380, Edwards said Thursday afternoon. That was up from 280 a day earlier.“My fear, based on modeling that I’ve received today, is that in as little as seven days we could start to exceed our capacity to deliver health care,” Edwards told Trump during a conference call the president held with governors that was carried by news networks.“We’ve got some requests in, for example we have a VA hospital in New Orleans where we’ve requested to be able to surge patients there,” Edwards said.“I’m going to try to get you immediate approval on the hospital,” Trump told Edwards.BRAZIL LOCKS ITSELF FROM ITS NEIGHBOURSBrazil is closing its borders with most of its South American neighbors, a decision most of them had already made, and treating any patients with “severe flu” as a coronavirus case.Latin America’s largest nation is still negotiating with Uruguay. Health Minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta also said families of people who tested positive will receive medical permission to stay home for two weeks.President Jair Bolsonaro, who initially dismissed the outbreak as “hysteria,” is trying to regain control of the fight against the virus that Mandetta and state governors have led thus far. Brazil has 621 confirmed cases of the COVID-19 virus and reported six deaths.PORTUGAL EMERGENCY IMPOSEDPortuguese Prime Minister António Costa announced that people infected with the coronavirus are to be confined to their residences and most retail outlets must close as part of a 15-day state of emergency in the European country.Those over 70 years old or with chronic ailments should only leave home for short walks for health reasons. Costa said the rest of the population should only leave home to commute to work, shop for necessities, to help a family member, to accompany children, or to walk a pet.Costa added that all retail shops except supermarkets, bakeries, pharmacies, gas stations, and newsstands are ordered to close.CANNES POSTPONEDFrance’s Cannes Film Festival, arguably the world’s most prestigious film festival and cinema’s largest annual gathering, has postponed its 73rd edition.Organizers of the French Riviera festival, scheduled to take place May 12-23, say they are considering moving the festival to the end of June or the beginning of July.Organizers had been reluctant to cancel Cannes. But as the coronavirus pandemic spread through France, it became all but inevitable that a massive gathering like Cannes couldn’t go on as scheduled. “See you very soon,” the festival said in a statement.US ARMY CONSIDERS DEPLOYING COMBAT HOSPITALArmy officials say one Army combat support hospital and one field hospital will soon be deployed.The combat hospital normally has 248 beds, including 48 for intensive care with ventilators, and the field hospital has 32 beds, but can be increased by another 60 beds. Of those, there could be as many as 24 intensive care beds with ventilators.The two units going are a combat hospital from Joint Base Lewis McCord in Washington and the 586th Field Hospital from Fort Campbell, Kentucky.According to a defense official, the likely two locations at this point are New York City and Seattle.FOREIGNERS REPORT HARASSMENT IN AFRICAN CAPITAL CITIESAnother US embassy in Africa is reporting anti-foreigner sentiment over the coronavirus.The embassy in Cameroon says Americans and other foreigners in the major cities of Yaounde and Douala reported “verbal and online harassment, stone throwing and banging on vehicles occupied by expatriates.”Many of Africa’s more than 600 confirmed cases of the coronavirus are people who recently arrived from the United States, Britain, Italy and other high-risk countries.The U.S. embassy in Ethiopia issued a similar security alert, prompting the prime minister’s office to announce that COVID-19 “is not related to any country or nationality.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-outbreak-how-the-world-is-tackling-the-crisis/story-YeHpTiXi1pn9UdhC1EUBEP.html
20-03-2020||World||Coronavirus deaths in Italy overtake China as economic damage mounts||The world’s richest nations poured unprecedented aid into the global economy on Thursday as coronavirus cases ballooned in the new epicentre Europe, with the number of deaths in Italy outstripping those in mainland China, where the virus originated. With over 242,000 infections and nearly 10,000 deaths, the epidemic has stunned the world and drawn comparisons with painful periods such as World War Two, the 2008 financial crisis and the 1918 Spanish flu.U.N. chief Antonio Guterres warned that a global recession, “perhaps of record dimensions”, was a near certainty.“This is a moment that demands coordinated, decisive, and innovative policy action from the world’s leading economies,” Guterres told reporters via a video conference. “We are in an unprecedented situation and the normal rules no longer apply.”Tourism and airlines have been particularly battered, as the world’s citizens hunker down to minimize contact and curb the spread of the highly contagious COVID-19 respiratory illness. But few sectors have been spared by a crisis threatening a lengthy global recession.The United States is urging Americans not to travel abroad at all and could announce restrictions at the U.S.-Mexican border on Friday. They would be similar to the closure of the U.S.-Canada border to non-essential traffic.Markets have suffered routs unseen since the 2008 financial debacle, with investors rushing to the U.S. dollar as a safe haven. Wall Street tried to bounce back on Thursday. The benchmark S&P 500 closed up 0.5%, still around 30% off highs reached last month. U.S. oil prices posted their largest one-day gain ever, rising 25%.Policymakers in the United States, Europe and Asia have slashed interest rates and opened liquidity taps to try to stabilise economies hit by quarantined consumers, broken supply chains, disrupted transport and paralysed businesses.The virus, thought to have originated from wildlife in mainland China late last year, has jumped to 172 other nations and territories with more than 20,000 new cases reported in the past 24 hours - a new daily record.Cases in Germany, Iran and Spain rose to more than 12,000 each. An official in Tehran tweeted that the coronavirus was killing one person every 10 minutes. London lockdown? Britain, which has reported 144 deaths, was closing dozens of underground stations in London and ordering schools shut from Friday. Some 20,000 soldiers were on standby, Queen Elizabeth headed for sanctuary in the ancient castle of Windsor, and the Tower of London was to close along with other historic buildings. “Many of us will need to find new ways of staying in touch with each other and making sure that loved ones are safe,” the 93-year-old monarch said in an address to the nation.“I am certain we are up to that challenge,” she added.Italian soldiers transported corpses overnight from an overwhelmed cemetery in Europe’s worst-hit nation where 3,405 people have died, more than in mainland China. Germany’s military was also preparing to help. Supermarkets in many countries were besieged with shoppers stocking up on food staples and hygiene products. Some rationed sales and fixed special hours for the elderly, who are particularly vulnerable to severe illness. Solidarity projects were springing up in some of the world’s poorest corners. In Kenya’s Kibera slum, volunteers with plastic drums of water and boxes of soap on motorbikes set up handwashing stations for people without clean water.Russia reported its first coronavirus death on Thursday.Amid the gloom, China provided a ray of hope as it reported zero new local transmissions of the virus, a sign of success for its draconian containment policies since January. Imported cases accounted for all 34 new infections in China.In the United States, where President Donald Trump had initially played down the coronavirus threat, infections surged with over 11,500 known cases and at least 186 deaths. Trump has infuriated Beijing’s Communist Party rulers by rebuking it for not acting faster and drawn accusations of racism by referring to COVID-19 as the “Chinese virus”.“We continue our relentless effort to defeat the Chinese virus,” he said in opening remarks at a briefing on Thursday.The head of the U.S. National Guard said tens of thousands of its troops could be activated to help U.S. states deal with the outbreak now in all 50 states. Motown shuts car plantsIn a bewildering raft of financial measures around the world, the European Central Bank launched new bond purchases worth 750 billion euros ($817 billion). That brought some relief to bond markets and also halted European shares’ slide.The U.S. Federal Reserve rolled out its third emergency credit programme in two days, aimed at keeping the $3.8 trillion money market mutual fund industry functioning. The Bank of England cut interest rates to 0.1%, its second emergency rate cut in just over a week. China was to unleash trillions of yuan of fiscal stimulus and South Korea pledged 50 trillion won ($39 billion).The desperate state of industry was writ large in Detroit, where the big three automakers - Ford Motor Co, General Motors Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV - were shutting U.S. plants, as well as factories in Canada and Mexico. Some automakers have pledged to help manufacture much needed medical supplies.With some economists fearing prolonged pain akin to the 1930s Great Depression and others anticipating a bounceback, gloomy data and forecasts abounded. In one of the most dire calls, J.P. Morgan economists forecast the Chinese economy to drop more than 40% this quarter and the U.S. economy to shrink 14% in the next. Ratings agency Moody’s prepared for mass downgradings. In Britain, small gin distilleries have started producing hand sanitizer amid a national shortage, a trend mirrored across the globe from Australia to the United States.And Monaco cancelled its showcase Formula One Grand Prix, the most famous and glamorous race on the calendar, in another high-profile sporting casualty of the epidemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-deaths-in-italy-overtake-china-as-economic-damage-mounts/story-4yfcDYFtUnjoSgFDDA3QnK.html
20-03-2020||World||Coronavirus Update: California governor orders entire state to stay at home||All residents of California were ordered to stay at home Thursday in a bid to battle the coronavirus pandemic in the most populous state in the US.The statewide order, which Governor Gavin Newsom said goes into effect “this evening,” is the most dramatic containment measure yet by a US state.“There is a mutuality, there is a recognition of our interdependence, that requires of this moment that we direct a statewide order for people to stay at home,” he said.No end date was set for the measure because the pandemic is a “dynamic situation,” said Newsom.California is home to more than 39 million people, and has been among the worst hit by the pandemic.It has experienced at least 18 deaths from the coronavirus, according to a Johns Hopkins tally.Newsom said he did not expect law enforcement would be required to enforce the measure.“People I think recognize the need to do more, and to meet this moment, and people will self regulate their behavior,” he said.Essential jobs and tasks such as grocery shopping would be exempt, he said.“We want people to go to essential jobs -- we want people to deal with their essentials in a thoughtful and judicious way.” In a letter to US President Donald Trump Wednesday requesting federal help, Newsom warned that cases were doubling every four hours in some parts of the state.“We project that roughly 56 percent of our population -- 25.5 million people -- will be infected with the virus over an eight week period,” he wrote.Newsom’s announcement came moments after Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti imposed a similar order on the state’s largest city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-california-governor-orders-entire-state-to-stay-at-home/story-qZqGvEfUS1xczSEEk6ceNN.html
20-03-2020||World||Covid-19 outbreak: Spain orders closure of all hotels due to coronavirus||Spain has ordered all hotels in its territory to close to help stem the spread of coronavirus, under a new measure announced in the state official bulletin on Thursday.The measure orders “the suspension of opening to the public of all hotels and similar lodgings, tourist accommodation and other short-term accommodation... situated on national territory,” the official notice published in BOE read.Hotels in Spain, the number-two tourist destination in the world, will close immediately for seven days.Long-stay accommodation can remain open, providing they have the necessary infrastructure for residents to abide by the conditions of total confinement currently in force in the country. Spain is the country that has been fourth-hardest hit by COVID-19, with 767 deaths and 17,147 infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-outbreak-spain-orders-closure-of-all-hotels-due-to-coronavirus/story-y3Iw8JHxBlkPnPt3phA6QN.html
20-03-2020||World||Coronavirus outbreak: Over 10,000 infected in US; two lawmakers test positive for Covid-19||The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Thursday reported 10,491 cases of coronavirus, an increase of 3,404 cases from its previous count, and said the death toll had risen by 53 to 150.Coronavirus cases have been reported in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The CDC figures do not necessarily reflect cases reported by the states. As the US witnessed a surge in infections - including two lawmakers - and fatalities, the White House warned young people that they may not be as resistant to the virus as earlier believed and appealed to them to behave more responsibly for their own sake and the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions.Mario Diaz-Balart, a Republican member of the House of Representatives from Florida, on Wednesday became the first US lawmaker to test positive for the virus, according to his office. Ben McAdams, a Democratic member of the House from Utah, followed suit with an announcement shortly after. Colleagues who had come in contact with them in recent days have gone into self-quarantine. US public health officials, experts and media commentators have expressed annoyance with widespread display of indifference from younger people to the dangers of the outbreak and recommended precautions. Visuals have been running on several TV channels showing a crowded beach in Florida.Police officers have had to move in to shut down bars and restaurants around the country that have continued to attract customers.The CDC said in a report that people between 20 and 44 years of age comprised the largest section of Americans infected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-outbreak-over-10-000-infected-in-us-two-lawmakers-test-positive-for-covid-19/story-Kr0oa9460LGQZavLoo4x5J.html
