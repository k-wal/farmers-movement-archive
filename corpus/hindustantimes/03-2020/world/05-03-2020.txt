McFarlane said in his judgement that at some stage in 2017 or 2018, she had an affair with one her bodyguards and her relationship with her husband had deteriorated by early 2019 when she left Dubai.Mohammed’s lawyer told the court Haya had closed the children’s bank accounts and withdrawn about $32 million before arriving in Britain.FRIENDS OF UK ROYALSHaya and Mohammed are both on friendly terms with members of the British royal family and in the past the sheikh, one of the founders of the Godolphin horse racing stable, has been pictured with Queen Elizabeth at Britain’s Royal Ascot horse races.Haya, who shares his love of horses and competed in equestrian jumping in the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, was schooled in Britain and is now living with their children in the couple’s luxury mansion near Kensington Palace in west London.McFarlane said the case had been unique.Outside the austere wood-pannelled courtroom of the Royal Courts of Justice, four or five bodyguards wearing earpieces patrolled, with only lawyers and a small number of journalists, including Reuters, allowed to be present.The lawyers’ benches were filled with some of Britain’s most senior legal operators including David Pannick, who successfully represented anti-Brexit campaigners in two high-profile court victories over the government and was drafted in by Mohammed to lead his team during the case.Haya herself attended all the hearings, accompanied by her legal team which included Fiona Shackleton who represented British heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles in his divorce from his late first wife Princess Diana.Giving evidence in person last November, she told McFarlane she feared the sheikh would abduct her two children, take them back to the Gulf Arab state and she would never see them again.“I have seen what has happened to their sisters and I can’t face the fact that the same might happen to them,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dubai-s-ruler-sheikh-mohammed-abducted-daughters-and-threatened-former-wife-uk-judge-rules/story-zMz2ooHdGNnShSJGWMfoTM.html

They were presented a cash prize of 250 pounds each and certificates during IJA’s symposium here on ‘The changing face of media’ on Thursday.Academics at Cardiff university’s School of Journalism, Media and Culture – a leading centre in the field – said Suri and Malhotra demonstrated a high level of skill and potential in their projects on the course that combines theory and practice.While Suri produced a portfolio of five print features on the #MeToo movement in India, Malhotra was chosen for her analytical television report on the development of Ganga river transportation and its impact on local communities.Matt Swaine, course director of MA International Journalism, said: “We are delighted to be working with the IJA on this award in what is the 50th anniversary of journalism training at Cardiff University”.“Our department attracts ambitious journalism students from across the world and our two inaugural winners represent the very best of that group. We have seen some very impressive students from India, and this year’s joint winners explored issues of great importance and delivered in both broadcast and print formats,” he added.Naresh Kaushik, IJA president and senior BBC journalist, said: “This is an annual IJA initiative to encourage Indian students of journalism coming to the UK, particularly at a time when the need for well-trained and impartial journalists has never been felt more”.The IJA symposium included contributions from journalists and experts, including Nic Newman of the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, Chris Morris and Samira Ahmed of the BBC, Mattia Peretti of the London School of Economics, Anushka Asthana of The Guardian, and Francesco Zaffarano of The Telegraph.Established in May 1947 as a representative body for UK-based correspondents and journalists reporting on and covering India and South Asia-related issues, the IJA membership includes journalists from major news media outlets in the UK and India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-students-in-uk-win-inaugural-ija-award/story-wlwuYiZMFoL9HLw3EtxkgN.html
05-03-2020||World||France coronavirus death toll rises to six, 92 new cases||The French health ministry reported Thursday two more deaths from coronavirus infections, bringing the country’s total to six, and 92 new cases since Wednesday.It was the biggest one-day jump in the number of French cases since the outbreak began, raising the total to 377.One 73-year-old victim was in the Oise department north of Paris where a cluster of cases has been reported, the other a 64-year-old from the nearby Aisne department, the ministry said.President Emmanuel Macron was meeting Thursday with top researchers leading the efforts to fight an outbreak that has seen authorities close around 150 schools.Government spokeswoman Sibeth Ndiaye said Wednesday that officials would probably have to raise the country’s epidemic alert to the maximum of level three, potentially leading to travel restrictions and clampdowns on public activities.“Slowing the spread will dampen the impact on the population when we go to level three, and limit the epidemic’s peak,” the health ministry said.On Thursday, Paris metro operator RATP reported that a station agent had tested positive for the virus, and had worked for several days before being hospitalised.A RATP union official said the woman had taken part in an evangelical rally last month in the eastern city of Mulhouse, where officials have said several other participants had come down with the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-coronavirus-death-toll-rises-to-six-92-new-cases/story-mWeVXVQjjAARYV9ipNaoBP.html
05-03-2020||World||Airstrike in northwestern Syria kills 15 including children, several wounded||An airstrike on a rebel-held village in northwestern Syria hit a poultry farm where several displaced families were taking shelter early Thursday, killing at least 15 people including children while wounding several others, opposition activists said.The activists blamed Russian warplanes for the strike on Maaret Musreen village, which is home to thousands of internally displaced people.The strike came hours ahead of a meeting between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss the escalation in Syria’s northwestern Idlib province, which comes amid a months long Russian-backed Syrian government offensive there.Nearly a million people have been displaced by the fighting in Idlib — Syria’s last remaining rebel stronghold — and hundreds have been killed. Many of the displaced have fled north toward the sealed border with Turkey.Turkey and Russia are the two main power brokers in Syria and each supports rival sides in the nine-year conflict.Violence worsened in Idlib in recent weeks, with Turkey sending thousands of troops into the area to support Syrian insurgents holed up there. But Erdogan hasn’t been able to halt Syrian President Bashar Assad’s offensive, which began in early December.Syrian and Turkish troops have engaged in deadly battles, leaving at least 58 Turkish soldiers dead since the beginning of February as well as scores of Syrian soldiers. Direct fighting between Turkish and Syrian government forces had been rare throughout the war.The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Thursday’s airstrike hit a poultry farm used as a settlement for internally displaced Syrians, killing 15 people including women and children. It said 18 others were wounded.The opposition’s Syrian Civil Defence group, also known as the White Helmets, blamed Russian warplanes for the strike as well. They said 14 people were killed, including five women and two children.A young man who said he survived the attack told The Associated Press said he was inside a building with his father when the airstrike hit. He suffered a minor injury to his face. He said he called out and searched for survivors, and that an ambulance arrived at the same time as his father made it out of the destroyed building.Paramedics were seen removing debris before dawn Thursday, using flashlights to reach some of the victims buried under the rubble. Chickens could be seen in the vicinity as the rescue operations took place, according to Associated Press video.Photos of the strike posted by the Civil Defence showed paramedics using a bulldozer to remove a ceiling that had apparently collapsed on top of people. Civil Defence said it had finished recovering bodies from under the rubble by Thursday morning.Step news agency, an activist collective, said 16 people were killed including five children and also said that 18 people were wounded.Such discrepancies on casualty figures are not uncommon in the immediate aftermath of attacks in Syria.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/airstrike-in-northwestern-syria-kills-15-including-children-several-wounded/story-WS0JKGjaNHu71xuLa3JawL.html

As a responsible major country, China has been strictly fulfilling the international non-proliferation obligations and international commitments,” foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian said at the regular ministry briefing on Thursday.“After seeking the information, we know that this item is actually a heat treatment furnace shell system, produced by a private company in China,” he said, adding:“This is not for military use and it is not a dual-use item under the non-proliferation and export control.”“The Chinese merchant ship and its owner have declared this item truthfully beforehand with the Indian authorities; so, there is no concealment and forced declaration,’’ the spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/item-seized-from-chinese-ship-not-meant-for-military-or-dual-use-says-china/story-w5A5MyVqjKWOHMQHBPQXaJ.html

One person in Thailand has died has from the disease, which first erupted in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in December.There have been no reports of the virus being contracted from packages posted from overseas, but the plan to disinfect them is one of the latest measures taken by authorities to halt the spread of the disease.“Thailand’s post offices will disinfect every package arriving from overseas, at headquarters, including at Suvarnabhumi airport, Lak Si post offices, express mail service and delivery trucks,” Thailand Post Chief Executive Officer, Korkij Danchaivichit, told reporters.In advice to the public posted on its website, the WHO said: “People receiving packages from China are not at risk of contracting the new coronavirus. From previous analysis, we know coronaviruses do not survive long on objects, such as letters or packages.”The new cases in Thailand included an Italian male, a Chinese student and two Thai nationals who returned from China and Iran, Suwanchai Wattanayingcharoen, director-general of the Department of Disease Control said in a news conference on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-begins-disinfecting-packages-sent-from-abroad-despite-who-s-reassurance/story-UpW4wo0OqVcsuz3uE8lYrL.html

05-03-2020||World||Britain moves into second phase of coronavirus battle plan||Britain is moving into the second of four phases in its battle plan against coronavirus, England’s Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said on Thursday, after confirmed cases jumped across the country.Britain has so far registered 90 cases of coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, which started in China, but has held off from introducing measures to restrict movement or to cancel events for fear of hurting the economy.Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he is optimistic that Britain is well prepared to cope with the spread of the virus, but early on Thursday regional airline Flybe became one of the first big corporate casualties of the outbreak.The government set out its action plan earlier this week based on four stages - containing the virus, delaying its transmission, researching its origins and mitigating its impact.Whitty, questioned by lawmakers, said Britain had mainly moved into the second stage of delaying transmission and was now considering measures to try to reduce the peak of an epidemic which officials are anticipating in the coming weeks.“The original plan ... was very much predicated on the idea of ‘if it could be controlled in China and contained everywhere else, this virus might go away’. I think the chances of that happening are now very slim. Slim to zero,” Whitty said.“As time goes by, we then may start to move into the more socially determined actions ... We’ve moved from a situation where we were mainly in contain ... to now we’re basically mainly delay.”The government has said it could encourage home-working, cancel large-scale gatherings and possibly close schools to slow the spread of the disease and delay the peak of the outbreak until summer, when the health service is under less pressure.Whitty also said, with older people more vulnerable to the virus, there may be measures to encourage them to stay away from public places, such as the upper house of parliament, the House of Lords.But so far, the government has refrained from triggering those measures, with Whitty saying health officials would present ministers with various options for them to decide what combination would be a “sensible response”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-moves-into-second-phase-of-coronavirus-battle-plan/story-acsbszmSUPXlcycMCZ88JO.html

05-03-2020||World||Former UN chief Javier Perez de Cuellar dead at 100||Former UN chief Javier Perez de Cuellar, who was known for his peace-making efforts including brokering a ceasefire in the Iran-Iraq war, died Wednesday in his native Peru, aged 100, his son said.Perez de Cuellar served as UN secretary general from 1981 to 1991, when he was often described as a “pacifist by vocation and nature.”Lauded by his countrymen as one of the most illustrious Peruvians of his era, Perez de Cuellar led the United Nations through a period marked by the fight against world hunger, the eight-year war between Iran and Iraq, as well as the civil war in US-supported El Salvador which led to UN-mediated peace talks.“My dad died after a complicated week. He died at 8:09 pm tonight (0109 GMT Thursday) and is resting in peace,” his son Francisco Perez de Cuellar told RPP radio.Perez de Cuellar was known for his efforts to reconcile warring parties.He played a crucial role in ending the Iran-Iraq war, securing the release of American hostages held in Lebanon and in peace agreements in Cambodia and El Salvador, the UN said.Perez de Cuellar considered the 1990 independence of Namibia, one of the last colonial enclaves on the African continent, his greatest accomplishment as secretary general.Current UN chief Antonio Guterres said he was “profoundly saddened” at the passing of his predecessor.“I extend my deepest condolences to Mr. Perez de Cuellar’s family, the Peruvian people and so many others around the world whose lives were touched by a remarkable and compassionate global leader who left our world a far better place,” he said.Peruvian President Martin Vizcarra expressed deep regrets on Twitter over the death of “a distinguished Peruvian, a democrat through-and-through, who dedicated his entire life to working to improve our country.”Perez de Cuellar’s popularity prompted him to accept the presidential nomination from one of Peru’s leading political parties -- the Union for Peru -- in 1995, which pitted him against then-incumbent president Alberto Fujimori. An ‘inspiration’ The unifying force behind the Union for Peru, Perez de Cuellar won only 21.8 percent of the vote, coming in second behind Fujimori who got 64.4 percent.In 1997, informants revealed that Perez de Cuellar had been subject to systematic surveillance and phone tapping during the campaign, ordered by the head of Fujimori’s intelligence services, Vladimiro Montesinos.Following the collapse of the Fujimori regime in November 2000, Perez de Cuellar was appointed head of a government of “unity and national reconciliation.”As prime minister, he helped expose a web of corruption woven by Montesinos over the course of Fujimori’s 10-year rule.After the election of president Alejandro Toledo in 2001, Perez de Cuellar was appointed ambassador to France.Born into an upper middle-class family in Lima and educated in Catholic schools, Perez de Cuellar spent most of his professional life outside his homeland, in diplomatic posts in Britain, Bolivia, Poland, the former Soviet Union, Switzerland and Venezuela.He was president of the UN Security Council from 1973 to 1974 and was UN permanent representative in Cyprus from 1975 to 1977.The career diplomat’s son and daughter are from his first marriage, along with six grandchildren. He and his second wife, Marcela Temple, had no children.A lawyer by education, Perez de Cuellar received honorary doctorates from nearly 40 universities around the world.UN Secretary General Guterres wished him “with pride & joy” a happy 100th birthday on January 19.“On this momentous occasion, we at the UN draw on his example for inspiration & are deeply grateful for his many contributions and achievements as Secretary-General,” Guterres wrote on Twitter.In his statement Wednesday, Guterres described Perez de Cuellar as “an accomplished statesman, a committed diplomat and a personal inspiration who left a profound impact on the United Nations and our world.”“Mr. Perez de Cuellar’s life spanned not only a century but also the entire history of the United Nations, dating back to his participation in the first meeting of the General Assembly in 1946,” he said.His tenure as head of the UN coincided with “some of the iciest years of the Cold War, and then, with the ideological confrontation at an end, a time when the United Nations began to play more fully the role envisaged by the founders.”Perez de Cuellar’s remains will lie at the Peruvian foreign ministry before burial on Friday, his son said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-un-chief-javier-perez-de-cuellar-dead-at-100/story-9vacdIU2isWwVeLpl1tNwL.html
05-03-2020||World||Can someone get infected by coronavirus second time? Here’s what experts say||The rise in coronavirus cases across the globe has left the public astonished with a flurry of queries sprouting around the virus that scientists know very little about. While the internet is flooded with the dos and don’ts on the infectious virus, not many know if a person infected with coronavirus can get it again after recovering. A report by China Global Television Network (CGTN) said that Chinese health officials are discussing the possibility of coronavirus relapse in patients who successfully recover. According to the report, China’s National Health Commission has said that recovered coronavirus patients can contract the virus again. Lu Qingyuan, director of pneumonia prevention and treatment at the China-Japan Friendship Hospital had said that although coronavirus antibodies will be generated in certain cases, they cannot last long. There remains a possibility of some patients suffering a relapse even after completely recovering, Qingyuan said. However, further analysis is required to confirm the possibility of a relapse in all coronavirus cases. Experts still don’t know enough about the virus to say whether infected people, once recovered, gain full immunity to stave off the virus in the future. It is difficult to access how strong and long-lasting are the antibodies in an infected person’s body for the infection to not occur again.Meanwhile, China has approved the use of Swiss drugmaker Roche’s anti-inflammation drug Actemra for patients who develop severe complications from the coronavirus as it urgently hunts for new ways to combat the deadly infection that is spreading worldwide, news agency Reuters reported. China is hoping that some older drugs could stop severe cytokine release syndrome (CRS), or cytokine storms, an overreaction of the immune system which is considered a major factor behind catastrophic organ failure and death in some coronavirus patients.Coronavirus has infected nearly 30 people in India, no loss of life has been reported. Globally, more than 3,000 people have been killed with thousands infected in over 70 countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/can-someone-get-infected-by-coronavirus-second-time-here-s-what-experts-say/story-Lg5fKzo4m8xb754u6OQWnJ.html

The WHO warned that there is a “very high” risk from the disease worldwide.China has imposed lockdown policies that restrict the movement of hundreds of millions of citizens in an effort to prevent new infections, while Italy has also put a string of towns into quarantine.Rights advocates have expressed alarm over intrusive surveillance measures used by countries including China and Russia to enforce quarantine rules.California Governor Gavin Newsom on Wednesday declared a state of emergency after the state reported its first death from coronavirus. California has confirmed 53 cases of the virus as of Wednesday afternoon.The outbreak, which was first reported in China’s Wuhan, has since spread to more than 60 countries, killing over 3000 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/seven-in-10-people-back-city-lockdowns-to-contain-coronavirus-says-poll/story-k3zntkvdcKrTb3sPxdVkIO.html

A dog of an infected person in Hong Kong has tested positive for the disease, which means the virus is likely to be transmitted from humans to animals. Hence, all pets of coronavirus patients in Hong Kong will now be quarantined for two weeks, starting Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-cases-outside-of-china-exceed-12-600-who/story-Oo0LGXBWhxHuULw3uX1EzH.html

The countries most affected include China, Italy, South Korea, Japan and Iran.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is making available about $50 billion through its rapid-disbursing emergency financing facilities for low income and emerging market countries that could potentially seek support to combat the spread of coronavirus.Of this, 10 billion dollars is available at zero interest for the poorest members through the rapid credit facility.“We know that the disease is spreading quickly. With over one-third of our membership affected directly, this is no longer a regional issue - it is a global problem calling for a global response,” IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said.The World Bank had on Tuesday announced an initial $12 billion in immediate funds to assist countries grappling with the health and economic impacts of the coronavirus virus outbreak that has spread quickly from China to some 60 other countries.The World Bank said the $12 billion in fast-track grants, loans and low-interest loans would help developing countries provide better access to health services, strengthen disease surveillance and bolster public health interventions, as well as work with the private sector to reduce the impact on economies.Shelves are being stripped bare of toilet rolls, hand sanitiser and surgical masks everywhere from Japan to France to the United States as panic buying criss-crosses the globe with the coronavirus, defying repeated calls for calm and disrupting supply chains.Obsessively documented on social media, scrambles to the shops and empty shelves are adding panic and confusion to the fight against the disease.On Saturday Japan’s prime minister took to Twitter to calm fears of a national shortage, while social media photos from the US show toilet paper shelves lying bare.India has stepped up screening and suspended visas from countries where the outbreak is reported after 29 cases of Covid-19 came to light in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-coronavirus-infections-top-94-000-says-who/story-A1BYGLU73H064jywpt0j9I.html

05-03-2020||World||As coronavirus spreads rapidly, a word of caution from China President||Over 3,000 people are now dead in China from the coronavirus outbreak, health officials said on Thursday. President Xi Jinping warned of the epidemic escalating outside the epicentre of Hubei province as more people travel and crowds gather across the country.Xi’s word of caution comes in the backdrop of the outbreak seemingly slowing on the Chinese mainland even as it rapidly spreads globally.The Covid-19 disease has now killed more than 3,200 and infected over 93,000 worldwide in more than 75 countries. The vast majority of the cases are in China.Latest statistics revealed 31 new deaths – all in Hubei - until Wednesday midnight and 139 new confirmed cases in the mainland.Also Watch l Coronavirus: California declares emergency as death toll reaches 11 in US The number of infected is now 80,409 while 3,012 are dead from the virus first discovered in early December in Wuhan.The number of new cases has been falling in China over several days now as hundreds of millions of Chinese continue to live under complete lockdowns or under some measures of movement restrictions.Xi’s recent statement indicates that the lockdowns and restrictions will continue for weeks ahead.He issued the warning at a gathering of the highest level of the Communist Party of China (CPC), a meeting of the Party’s central committee’s politburo standing committee which is the top seven-member decision-making group.“While the task of containing the epidemic remains arduous and onerous in the outbreak epicentre Hubei province and its capital city Wuhan, the risk of an outbreak is rising in other regions as more people move around and crowds gather,” Xi was quoted as saying in a statement issued by official news agency, Xinhua.He demanded that there should be no relaxation in the “epidemic response preparedness”.“After the whole country’s arduous efforts, a positive trend has emerged as the epidemic prevention and control situation has seen steady improvement and the resumption of the order of work and life has been accelerating,” Xi said.Xi stressed a clear understanding of the complexity of the current situation for epidemic prevention and control as well as economic and social development.According to a statement released at the end of the meeting, the CPC leadership talked about “…unleashing consumption that had been suppressed by the outbreak and strengthening new and upgraded consumption to compensate the lost consumption on goods and services during the outbreak”.“More attention is paid to epidemic prevention and control work in Beijing and other key regions,” they said.Meanwhile, central China’s Hubei province has classified its cities and counties based on the risks of the epidemic, according to local authorities.Twenty-two cities and counties had been classified as low-risk, while 17 classified as mid-risk and 37 as high-risk, by the end of Tuesday.“Cities, counties and districts with no newly confirmed cases in the last 14 days are categorised as low-risk regions, those with less than 50 cases or with over 50 but without cluster outbreak are classified as mid-risk regions and those with over 50 cases as well as cluster outbreak are classified as high-risk regions,” state news agency Xinhua said in a report on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-3000-dead-in-china-xi-jinping-warns-of-spread-outside-epicentre-hubei/story-RTZ97NTMYYl66vvcNYQUZI.html
05-03-2020||World||290 million students out of school as global coronavirus battle intensifies||Almost 300 million students worldwide faced weeks at home on Thursday with Italy the latest country to shut schools over the deadly new coronavirus, as the IMF urged an all-out, global offensive against the epidemic.More than 95,000 people have been infected and over 3,200 have died worldwide from the virus, which has now reached some 80 countries and territories.The vast majority of global deaths and infections are in China, where the virus first emerged late last year, prompting the country to quarantine entire cities, temporarily shut factories and close schools indefinitely.As the virus spread, other countries have also implemented extraordinary measures, with UNESCO saying Wednesday that 13 countries have closed schools, affecting 290.5 million children, while nine others have implemented localised closures.While temporary school closures during crises are not new, UNESCO chief Audrey Azoulay said, “the global scale and speed of the current educational disruption is unparalleled and, if prolonged, could threaten the right to education.” Italy on Wednesday ordered schools and universities shuttered until March 15, ramping up its response as the national death toll rose to 107, the deadliest outbreak outside China.South Korea -- the country with the largest number of cases outside China with nearly 6,000 -- has postponed the start of the current term until March 23.In Japan, nearly all schools are closed after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called for classes to be cancelled through March and spring break, slated for late March through early April.Some 120 schools closed in France this week in areas with the largest numbers of infections.The German health minister said the outbreak was now a “global pandemic” -- a term the World Health Organisation has stopped short of using, meaning the virus is spreading in several regions through local transmission.Infections are now rising faster abroad than they are in China, where 31 more deaths and 139 new cases were reported Thursday. China’s death toll now stands at 3,012, with over 80,000 infections.From western Europe to eastern Asia, supermarket shelves have been stripped of supplies in recent weeks, including toilet paper and hand sanitiser.American businesses are increasingly concerned over access to goods and the overall economic outlook is more uncertain, the US Federal Reserve said in its beige book survey released on Wednesday.With the US toll rising to 11 on Wednesday, lawmakers in Congress reached a deal to provide more than USD 8 billion to fight the outbreak.The virus impact has spread beyond supply chains -- stock markets have rumbled as warnings from financial bodies mount that countries could be pushed into recession.The IMF said the epidemic posed a “serious threat” and would slow global growth to below last year’s 2.9 per cent.“At a time of uncertainty... it is better to do more than to do not enough,” IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva said.The epidemic “is a global problem calling for global response,” she said.Eurozone ministers agreed after a meeting that they were ready to “use all appropriate policy tools to achieve strong, sustainable growth”.As the virus continues its march across the world, governments are scrambling to tighten prevention efforts.Italy has seen its outbreak swell despite tough measures, including a quarantine of 11 towns with 50,000 people.New measures include a month-long nationwide ban on fan attendance at sports events, as well as advising people to avoid greetings like kissing on the cheek or shaking hands.Prime Minister Giuseppe Conti said the country could tackle the outbreak as long as it remained contained.“But in case of exponential growth, not just Italy but any other country in the world would not be able to manage the situation,” he said.In Iran, where 92 people have died from the disease, schools have been shut and major cultural and sporting events suspended.Saudi Arabia has suspended the year-round “umrah” pilgrimage, an unprecedented move that raises fresh uncertainty over the annual hajj.Countries also continue to crack down on international travel.Israel extended its mandatory quarantine measures -- already in place for travellers from Italy and some Asian countries -- to cover people from France, Germany, Spain, Austria and Switzerland.Even cinemagoers were not immune from the effects of the virus -- the producers of the latest James Bond film pushed back the release of the forthcoming “No Time To Die” from April to November.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/290-million-students-out-of-school-as-global-coronavirus-battle-intensifies/story-30YzElDyUlDepCOW2ujMPN.html
05-03-2020||World||New coronavirus deaths in US as lawmakers reach $8.3 billion funding deal||The death toll in the United States from the new coronavirus rose to 11 on Wednesday, as lawmakers in Congress agreed to provide more than $8 billion to fight the rapidly spreading disease.California Governor Gavin Newsom declared an emergency as he reported the state’s first fatality from the COVID-19 illness -- an elderly person who had taken a cruise to Mexico -- while health officials in nearby Washington state said a 10th person had died there.“The State of California is deploying every level of government to help identify cases and slow the spread of this coronavirus,” Newsom told reporters.“This emergency proclamation will help the state further prepare our communities and our health care system in the event it spreads more broadly.” Earlier in the day, Los Angeles County officials reported six new cases in the West Coast metropolis, while the number of confirmed cases in New York state rose to 11.One of the Los Angeles cases concerns a medical screener at the city’s international airport checking overseas travellers for symptoms.The Department of Homeland Security said the worker was under self-quarantine at home along with family members and was showing mild symptoms.That person’s last shift at the airport was on February 21 and the symptoms began on February 29, a statement said.“DHS is happy to report that this individual was highly trained and did everything right both on the job and when they began to feel sick,” the statement said.“We are told the individual wore all the correct protective equipment and took necessary protections on the job.” Nationwide, more than 130 people have so far been infected, with the virus detected in more than a dozen states. Most of the deaths have been in Washington state including residents of a nursing home.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi meanwhile said Republicans and Democrats had reached a deal to fund the response to the outbreak to the tune of $8.3 billion. The House of Representatives passed the measure, and the Senate was to vote on Thursday.Vice President Mike Pence, who is the White House’s pointman on the crisis, told reporters he would be traveling to Minnesota on Thursday to visit a 3M plant manufacturing personal protective equipment including masks.He will then visit Washington state and meet with Governor Jay Inslee to review containment efforts in the Seattle area.All of the newly infected individuals in Los Angeles were exposed to COVID-19 through close contact, health officials said.Barbara Ferrer, director of the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, said three of the cases concerned travelers who had gone together to northern Italy -- a virus hotspot with more than 100 deaths.Two other cases involved individuals who had come in contact with a family member who had the virus and the last was the airport screener.“The step we’re taking today is about preparation, not panic,” said Mayor Eric Garcetti of the emergency declaration.Officials said they expected the number of infections in California to rise in the coming days and urged families to brace for possible school closures and the cancellation of public events.Statewide, more than 50 people are known to be infected, the most of any state.In Washington state, officials in King County, which includes Seattle and where most of the deaths have taken place, said they were purchasing an 85-bed motel to house patients stricken with the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-coronavirus-deaths-in-us-as-lawmakers-reach-8-3-billion-funding-deal/story-RFWBsd3nuAO1PPS0hdbUcN.html

05-03-2020||World||Trump hails rival Joe Biden’s ‘incredible comeback’ after Super Tuesday polls||President Donald Trump on Wednesday hailed Democrat Joe Biden’s “incredible comeback” in the primaries race and signalled how he will attack the new frontrunner, saying he was surrounded by far leftists.“It was a great comeback for Joe Biden, an incredible comeback when you think about it,” Trump told reporters at the White House the morning after the Democrats’ Super Tuesday polls.Biden is running as a moderate, in contrast to his leftist rival Bernie Sanders, but Trump insisted that some of the former vice president’s “handlers are further left than Bernie. That’s pretty scary.” In his first public comments on the dramatic events of Super Tuesday -- other than a series of mocking tweets -- Trump also said that Sanders could easily have won if liberal Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren had dropped out earlier, thereby not splitting his vote.Trump noted that decisions by two centrists -- Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar -- to drop out and endorse Biden had electrified the previously struggling vice president’s campaign.Had Warren done something similar to help Sanders, then the self-described democratic socialist, who is calling for a political revolution, “would have won a lot of states.” “She was really a spoiler, because other people got out and those votes went to Joe. Those people really helped Joe, you know, by getting out early,” Trump said.“Had she gotten out, it would have been a very different situation, I think. It would have been a very different night.” Trump also had a typically bitter appraisal of billionaire Mike Bloomberg’s flat performance, despite having spent a record hundreds of millions of his own dollars on creating a campaign.Bloomberg quit the race on Wednesday, throwing his support and likely bottomless funding behind Biden.Trump dismissed the importance of this, saying “he’s going to try and save face by putting some money into Biden’s campaign. We’ll see what happens. I don’t think that’s going to have an impact.” “He’s doing that because he’s spiteful, he’s a spiteful guy, I know him well,” Trump said. “He made a fool out of himself.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-hails-rival-joe-biden-s-incredible-comeback-after-super-tuesday-polls/story-krd7FVH0UEr9QD6Ok6CesK.html
05-03-2020||World||China’s coronavirus death toll surpasses 3,000||China on Thursday reported 31 more deaths from the new coronavirus epidemic, taking the country’s overall toll past 3,000, with the number of new infections slightly increasing.At least 3,012 people have now died nationwide in the outbreak that first emerged in the central city of Wuhan, capital of Hubei province, in December.Most of the deaths -- 2,305 -- and cases have been recorded in Wuhan, which has been under an unprecedented lockdown along with the rest of Hubei since late January.But the quarantine and other travel restrictions across the country appear to be paying off, with official figures showing a generally steady drop in new cases in recent weeks.The National Health Commission also reported 139 new cases on Thursday, slightly up from 119 the previous day, raising the overall number of confirmed infections to 80,409.Only five of the new cases were outside Hubei.But China is now worried about importing cases from abroad as the virus has since spread to some 80 countries and territories, infecting more than 10,000 and killing more than 200 abroad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-coronavirus-death-toll-surpasses-3-000/story-bMntKj66mW3PzWhb94J25J.html
05-03-2020||World||Pet dog infected with coronavirus in Hong Kong||The pet dog of a coronavirus patient in Hong Kong was confirmed to be infected with the disease, in a likely case of human-to-animal transmission, authorities said on Wednesday. The canine, which belongs to a 60-year-old woman patient, had repeatedly tested “weak positive” for the new coronavirus since Friday, when it was quarantined at an animal centre. The city’s Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) said repeated tests suggest the dog -- a pomeranian -- has “a low-level of infection”.The AFCD said experts from universities and the World Organisation for Animal Health have unanimously agreed that “it is likely to be a case of human-to-animal transmission”.The pomeranian has not shown any novel coronavirus symptoms, it said.New measures put in place by Hong Kong’s government last Friday mean all pets infected with the coronavirus must be quarantined for 14 days. Two dogs are already in isolation. The other dog in quarantine belongs to a second coronavirus patient that tested negative for the virus once and will be tested again before its release.Authorities said they will continue to closely monitor the pomeranian and return it to its owner when it tests negative for the disease.“Apart from maintaining good hygiene practices, pet owners need not be overly concerned and under no circumstances should they abandon their pets,” an AFCD spokesman said.The financial hub has confirmed 104 cases of the new coronavirus in humans, with two deaths earlier this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pet-dog-infected-with-coronavirus-in-hong-kong/story-x58XW3XXi86WbkDV7BcNZN.html
05-03-2020||World||Coronavirus erases hopes for stronger growth in 2020, says IMF chief||The global spread of the novel coronavirus has crushed hopes for stronger growth this year and will hold 2020 global output gains to their slowest pace since the 2008-2009 financial crisis, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said on Wednesday.The IMF now expects 2020 world growth to be below the 2.9% rate for 2019, and revised forecasts will be issued in the coming weeks, Georgieva told a news briefing. Trade wars pushed global growth last year to the lowest rate since a 0.7% contraction in 2009. The changed forecast would represent a more than 0.4-percentage-point drop from the 3.3% growth the IMF had estimated for 2020 in January as US-China trade tensions eased.“Global growth in 2020 will dip below last year’s levels, but how far it will fall and how long the impact will be is still difficult to predict,” Georgieva said. She declined to say whether the escalating health crisis could push the world into a recession.The IMF is making available $50 billion in emergency funding to help poor and middle-income countries with weak health systems respond to the epidemic, she said after a call with the IMF’s steering committee.About $10 billion of that can be accessed by the poorest countries at zero interest for up to 10 years, while many middle-income countries have access to a pool of about $40 billion at low interest for up to five years.Ecuador used the latter program in 2016 to get a $364 million loan after a devastating earthquake.But larger emerging-market countries such as Brazil, China, and India are ineligible for such assistance, as are countries where the IMF has declared debt to be unsustainable, including Argentina.Georgieva and World Bank President David Malpass underscored the importance of coordinated action to limit the economic and human impact of the virus.The World Bank said on Tuesday it was providing $12 billion in immediate funds to help developing countries improve their health services, disease surveillance, access to medical supplies and working capital for businesses.DEEPER DECLINELess than two weeks ago, the IMF told G20 finance leaders in Saudi Arabia that the virus could shave 0.1 percentage point off its January global growth forecast, a milder scenario based on expectations the coronavirus would be largely contained within China.That view changed over the past week as the virus spread rapidly outside China to more than 70 countries, Georgieva said.The shift has vastly increased uncertainty and caused demand worldwide to weaken, hitting trade and tourism hard and slashing demand for oil and other commodities as individuals and businesses take precautionary measures to avoid infection.In China, even as the spread of the virus has slowed, growth will be below the IMF’s most recent forecast for 5.6% in 2020, Georgieva said. Still, the Fund was encouraged by the restart of some production in China, which is now at about 60% recovered and aiming to reach 90% in coming weeks, she said.She declined to discuss more specific scenarios on potential downgrades in growth estimates, saying: “What helps is concentrating on actions. Who cares if it will be 0.1 or 0.4 or 0.5? If we act, and focus on that, lives would be saved, suffering would be reduced and the economy would perk up faster.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-erases-hopes-for-stronger-growth-in-2020-says-imf-chief/story-h5yeHuwZaett3rpY8S90iO.html
05-03-2020||World||UK seizes 3.5 million ED pills, mostly exported from India||Britain’s medicine regulators seized 3.5 million erectile dysfunction (ED) pills worth more than £10 million in 2019 – 96 per cent of them shipped from India to customers in the UK – as part of a campaign to prevent fake medicines from entering the country.The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said on Wednesday that the vast majority of such pills had been exported from India (96 per cent), followed by China (1.5 per cent), and other countries accounting for less than 1 per cent.According to the MHRA, erectile problems affect up to 21% of men in the UK, which is equivalent to 4.3 million men. It added that 44% of men with ED aged 40 and over have not sought medical help and may be buying fake products online.Urging caution while buying ordering medicines online, the MHRA said: “Fake ED drugs can lead to more than just a let-down in the bedroom. There is no way of knowing what is in them nor the negative health effects they can have”.ED pills are available through pharmacies on a doctor’s prescription.“Whilst it might seem appealing to skip the need for an assessment from a healthcare professional by buying medicines online, men with erectile problems may be putting their health at risk”, the regulator added.Fake medicines may not contain any active ingredients, or worse, may contain toxic ingredients that could lead to serious health consequences, the MHRA said, noting that more than half of all medicines and medical devices bought online are fake or counterfeit.Often illegal traders posed as legitimate suppliers, selling medications that are unlicensed for the UK market and offering tempting prices lower than the real deal, officials said. As part of the #FakeMeds campaign launched in 2016, the MHRA has cracked down on sites selling unlicensed products.Mark Jackson, MHRA’s head of enforcement, said: “Fake ED drugs might not give you the result you want or even make you ill. Any medication bought from an unregistered website may be fake and will not meet quality and safety standards”.The MHRA is responsible for regulating all medicines and medical devices in the UK by ensuring they work and are acceptably safe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-seizes-3-5-million-ed-pills-mostly-exported-from-india/story-FTI56P9cVqXtf8jXSNUmlK.html
