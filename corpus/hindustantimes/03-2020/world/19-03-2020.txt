The palace announced that he tested positive for the virus but was continuing to work from his office and was being treated by doctors from Princess Grace Hospital, named after his American actress mother.In the U.S., Congress rushed to pass a $1 trillion emergency package to shore up the sinking economy and help households pull through the crisis, with the first of two possible rounds of relief checks consisting of payments of $1,000 per adult and $500 for each child.The worldwide death toll crept toward 10,000 as the total number of infections topped 220,000, including nearly 85,000 people who have recovered.French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe pleaded with people to keep their distance from one another to avoid spreading the virus, even as the crisis pushed them to seek comfort.“When you love someone, you should avoid taking them in your arms,” he said in Parliament. “It’s counterintuitive, and it’s painful. The psychological consequences, the way we are living, are very disturbing — but it’s what we must do.”The American death toll rose to 160, primarily elderly people.Health authorities have cited a variety of reasons for Italy’s high toll, key among them its large population of elderly people, who are particularly susceptible to serious complications from the virus, though severe cases have also been seen in younger patients. Italy has the world’s second-oldest population, and the vast majority of its dead — 87% — were over 70.Jonas Schmidt-Chanasit, a virologist at Germany’s Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine, said Italy’s high death rate could be explained in part by the almost total breakdown of the health system in some areas.“That’s what happens when the health system collapses,” he said.On a visit to the northern city of Milan, the head of a Chinese Red Cross delegation helping advise Italy said he was shocked to see so many people walking around, using public transportation and eating out.Sun Shuopeng said Wuhan saw infections peak only after a month of a strictly enforced lockdown.“Right now we need to stop all economic activity and we need to stop the mobility of people,” he said. “All people should be staying at home in quarantine.”Aside from the elderly and the sick, most people have mild or moderate symptoms, like a fever or cough, and most recover in a matter of weeks.Spain has been the hardest-hit European country after Italy, and in Madrid a four-star hotel began operating as a makeshift hospital for coronavirus patients.The director of the group that runs the Ayre GH Colon hotel tweeted: “365 rooms more to help win the war.” The Madrid Hotel Business Association said it has placed 40 hotels with room for 9,000 people at the service of the Madrid region, which has near half of Spain’s 17,000 or so cases.In London, home to almost 9 million, the government urged people to stay off public transportation as authorities considered imposing tougher travel restrictions.The British supermarket chain Sainsbury’s reserved the first hour of shopping for vulnerable customers, one of many such efforts around the world.Jim Gibson, 72, of London, said he found most of his groceries there in a “relatively trauma-free” experience. But he fretted that he hadn’t been able to get the medicine he needed for his wife and himself, and expressed concerns that Britain’s government had been too slow in ramping up testing.“You can’t go on ignoring World Health Organization guidelines — if they’re wrong, who the hell is right?” he said. “Let’s have no shilly-shallying.”The British government, which was slow to react to the virus, has shifted gears and is now drawing up legislation giving itself new powers to detain people and restrict gatherings. The bill is expected to be approved by Parliament next week.Thursday marked the first time since Jan. 20 that Wuhan showed no new locally transmitted cases, a rare glimmer of hope and perhaps a lesson in the strict measures needed to contain the virus.Wuhan, which has been under a strict lockdown since January, once was the place where thousands lay sick or dying in hurriedly constructed hospitals. But Chinese authorities said all 34 new cases recorded over the previous day had come from abroad.“Today, we have seen the dawn after so many days of hard effort,” said Jiao Yahui, a senior inspector at the National Health Commission.Meanwhile, the World Health Organization warned that the virus is spreading quickly in Africa — an especially alarming development, given the poor state of health care in many of its countries.“About 10 days ago we had about five countries” with the virus, said WHO’s Africa chief, Dr. Matshidiso Moeti. Now 35 of Africa’s 54 countries have cases, with the total close to 650. It is an “extremely rapid evolution,” she said. The first sub-Saharan Africa case was announced Feb. 28.European stock markets were up only slightly after losses in Asia despite a massive 750 billion-euro stimulus package announced overnight by the European Central Bank.Wall Street was calm in early trading by the standards of the past few days, when traders — weighing the increasing likelihood of a recession against the huge economic support pledged by global authorities — have caused wild swings.With wide swaths of the U.S. economy grinding to a halt, the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits surged by 70,000 last week, more than economists expected.The U.S. Federal Reserve unveiled measures to support money-market funds and borrowing as investors worldwide rush to build up dollars and cash.Ford, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler, along with Honda and Toyota, announced on Wednesday that they would close all of their factories in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. The shutdown of Detroit’s Big Three alone will idle about 150,000 workers.More borders closed, leaving tens of thousands of tourists wondering how they would get home. In the Pacific, Australia and New Zealand shut out tourists.Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei planned to pardon 10,000 more prisoners — including an unknown number of political detainees— to combat the virus. The country, where more than 1,100 people have already died, previously freed 85,000 prisoners on temporary leave.In Austria, the province of Tyrol put 279 municipalities under quarantine because of a large number of infections, barring people from leaving towns or villages except to go to work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-overtakes-china-registers-highest-number-of-coronavirus-deaths/story-GWT3n091sWZS0OhPcIBaVK.html

19-03-2020||World||Coronavirus update: UK death toll 128; Bank of England cuts interest rate to historic low of 0.1%||The Bank of England on Thursday cut interest rate in an emergency move to support the UK economy in the face of the coronavirus pandemic to 0.1% - the lowest it has been in British history – as the death toll rose to 128.Lowering the interest rate was among new plans of the Boris Johnson government to deal with the growing scale of the challenge, including publishing a new bill in the House of Commons to provide more emergency powers to authorities.The government said the new powers will be used only if needed, judged on the basis of the clinical and scientific advice. Safeguards have been built in to ensure that powers are only used as necessary, for example during the peak of a coronavirus outbreak.“The aim is to balance the need for speed, as appropriate to the risk posed by the virus, with safeguards to ensure proper oversight and accountability”, the government said.The bill has four primary categories of effect: enhancing capacity and the flexible deployment of staff; easing of legislative and regulatory requirements; containing and slowing the virus; and managing the deceased”.Queen Elizabeth moved from Buckingham Palace to Windsor as part of social distancing. The Bank of England headed by the new governor Andrew Bailey said it would also increase its holdings of UK government and corporate bonds by £200 billion, effectively pumping more money into the economy.Last week, the bank announced a 0.5% cut in rates to 0.25% and a package of measures to help businesses and individuals cope with the economic damage, but went further on Thursday and cut it to an all-time low to 0.1%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-uk-death-toll-128-bank-of-england-cuts-interest-rate-to-historic-low-of-0-1/story-UGiuIagq8DvkI905LAQFjJ.html
19-03-2020||World||Tulsi Gabbard quits US presidential race, endorses Joe Biden||US congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard dropped out of the Democratic presidential nomination race Thursday and immediately endorsed rival Joe Biden as flag bearer heading into the November election against President Donald Trump.“Today, I’m suspending my presidential campaign and offering my full support to vice president Joe Biden in his quest to bring our country together,” the lawmaker from Hawaii said in an online video message.“Although I may not agree with the vice president on every issue, I know that he has a good heart, and he is motivated by his love for our country and the American people.”Her move leaves front runner Biden and leftist Senator Bernie Sanders as the final two candidates in the Democratic race. Gabbard’s endorsement comes as somewhat of a surprise, given that she was a fierce supporter of Sanders in 2016 and supports his Medicare for All plan for a government health system to cover every American.But Sanders is under mounting pressure to drop out after performing poorly in several recent primaries including three states swept by Biden this week.“After Tuesday’s election, it’s clear that Democratic primary voters have chosen vice president Joe Biden to be the person who will take on President Trump in the general election,” Gabbard said. “I’m confident that he will lead our country, guided by the spirit of ‘aloha,’ respect and compassion, and thus help heal the divisiveness that has been tearing our country apart.”Gabbard, 38, was never a serious factor in the nomination battle. But she made the debate stage a few times in 2019 and used the opportunities to highlight what she described as excessive US military engagement abroad.And, running a shoestring campaign that counted on volunteers and focused on a handful of states, she outlasted the five other women in the historically diverse 2020 field.Gabbard noted she was dropping out during a time of “unprecedented global crisis,” and called for Americans to “work hand in hand to defeat this new enemy, the coronavirus.”Gabbard has served tours in Iraq in 2004 and Kuwait in 2008 as a reservist in Hawaii’s Army National Guard. Last August she paused her presidential campaign for reservist training.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tulsi-gabbard-quits-us-presidential-race-endorses-joe-biden/story-WwqQmNKzZzMM09eVp44ECJ.html
19-03-2020||World||Coronavirus outbreak: UK military sets up ‘COVID Support Force’||The Boris Johnson government on Thursday announced for the formation of a new ‘COVID Support Force’ comprising 10,000 military personnel, besides 150 others trained to drive oxygen tankers across the UK to support the National Health Service deal with the coronavirus challenge.The new force is on top of the 10,000 already held at high level of readiness, as part of contingency planning to respond in a timely way to any request from other governments departments or civil authorities for support, the ministry of defence said.So far, the UK military has assisted with repatriation flights from China and Japan. Measures have also been taken to enable the call-out of Reservists, should they be required to join the response effort. The ministry said scientists from the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory are supporting Public Health England’s effort to understand the virus and tackle the spread.Defence secretary Ben Wallace said: “The men and women of our armed forces stand ready to protect Britain and her citizens from all threats, including COVID-19. The unique flexibility and dedication of the services means that we are able to provide assistance across the whole of society in this time of need”.“From me downwards the entirety of the Ministry of Defence and the armed forces are dedicated to getting the nation through this global pandemic”, he said, adding that there are well-rehearsed mechanisms in place for the military to provide support to civil authorities in times of need.Major-general Charlie Stickland of the Defence Staff Operations and Commitments said: “Putting more personnel at a higher state of readiness and having our Reserves on standby gives us greater flexibility to support public services as and when they require our assistance”.“The COVID Support Force, potentially drawing upon our highly skilled scientists at Defence Science and Technology and Laboratory or oxygen tanker drivers, will form part of a whole force effort to support the country during its time of need”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-outbreak-uk-military-sets-up-covid-support-force/story-iRX5lf3EuAYUkmAuh2FNoI.html
19-03-2020||World||Coronavirus: China to deport Australian woman for breaking home quarantine rule||An Australian-Chinese woman is being deported for breaking quarantine rules in Beijing, local media reported Thursday as China tightens rules for preventing Covid-19 cases from the overseas spread in big cities.Identified as Liang, the woman is said to have flouted home quarantine rules earlier this week after returning from abroad and going out jogging without wearing a mask.According to state-controlled, China Daily newspaper, clips shared on China’s Twitter-like Weibo on March 16, show the woman ignoring police officers’ directives to go home after being caught outside without a mask.Liang also lost her job at the German pharmaceutical giant Bayer after the viral videos showed her confronting Beijing police while breaking home quarantine.“Instead of staying at home for the two-week observation as required, she was found running outside without wearing a mask, and did not listen and even shouted “help” when a community staff member tried to persuade her to go home,” the newspaper reported, adding that she did not obey until the police arrived and gave her a warning.The Beijing municipal government announced that starting Thursday, all people entering Beijing from overseas were to be transferred to designated quarantine venues for 14 days. They must pay the bills themselves. The directive said that even people who live alone are not allowed to take home quarantine except for some special cases such as minors, the elderly, and people with underlying conditions.The Beijing government said it won’t accept such applications for home quarantine from Thursday, the report said.“As the first gateway safeguarding the capital, the Beijing Capital International Airport is facing mounting pressure from growing numbers of inbound passengers. Since February 29, 2,417 people with suspicious symptoms have been transferred to medical institutions after being screened by the airport customs, 127 per day on average. The number peaked on Wednesday with 479 people,” Beijing authorities were quoted as saying by the local media on Thursday. An editorial in China Daily advocated “strict vigilance” against a re-seeding of the virus from abroad.“[A] single spark can start a prairie fire,” it said.The new cases from outside the country highlight “the risks that loom at the gate.”Beijing recorded 21 new cases of infections from abroad on Wednesday, most people traveling from Spain and Britain.The Beijing infections accounted for the majority of the 34 new imported cases in mainland China.The total number of imported cases in China stood at 189 until Wednesday midnight.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-china-to-deport-australian-woman-for-breaking-home-quarantine-rule/story-S9mKQE3Dt9hXhCjn4NHX1K.html

We admire and appreciate the support from all sectors of the Indian society for China’s anti-epidemic efforts in various ways,” the foreign ministry said.The Indian government had sent 15 tons of medical supplies to China on an Indian Air Force flight that also took back about a 100 Indians from Wuhan and Hubei on its way back in the last week of February.The Indian medical assistance to China comprised “…masks, gloves and other emergency medical equipment”.“This assistance has been provided in the wake the Corona virus (Covid 19) outbreak in China and the request by China to provide supplies such as masks and medical equipment,” an Indian government statement had then said.Earlier in February, New Delhi evacuated more than 300 Indians in two special Air India flights from Wuhan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-in-india-ready-to-help-india-with-epidemic-prevention-experience-says-china/story-Gnmoz731NQc9zxHaLAmqeI.html

Azzolina said schools would reopen only when there would be “certainty of absolute safety”, adding that the end of the school year would depend on how well online lessons would go in coming weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/schools-in-italy-likely-to-close-beyond-april-3-says-education-minister-as-the-country-battles-coronavirus/story-A6W0ME4kCZP5HmcNuWY6BP.html
19-03-2020||World||China reports zero new domestic coronavirus cases for first time||China on Thursday marked a major milestone in its battle against the coronavirus pandemic as it recorded zero domestic infections for the first time since the outbreak emerged, but a spike in imported cases threatened its progress.The stark reversal comes as nations across the world have shut down in a desperate effort to contain the pandemic, with more people now infected and having died abroad than in China.There were no new cases in Wuhan -- the central city where the virus first emerged in December -- for the first time since authorities started publishing figures in January, according to the National Health Commission.Wuhan and its 11 million people were placed under strict quarantine on January 23, with more than 40 million other people in the rest of Hubei province entering lockdown in the following days.The rest of China also enacted tough measures to limit public gatherings.There were eight more deaths in China -- all in Hubei -- raising the nationwide total to 3,245, according to the commission.There have been nearly 81,000 infections in China but only 7,263 people remain sick with the COVID-19 disease.The global number has shot past 200,000, with more than 8,700 deaths.On March 10, President Xi Jinping visited Wuhan for the first time since the outbreak began and declared that the spread of the disease was “basically curbed”.The same day, Hubei officials allowed people to travel within the province for the first time since January, excluding Wuhan.On Wednesday, Hubei authorities announced they were partially opening its borders to allow healthy people from low-risk areas to leave the province if they have jobs or residences elsewhere. This also excludes Wuhan.Life has slowly started to return to normal in the rest of the country, with people back at work, factories up and running, and schools in some regions resuming or preparing to go back to class.Second wave But there is concern about a second wave of infections due to an influx of cases from abroad, with an average of 20,000 people flying into China every day.Beijing and other regions now require most international arrivals to go into 14-day quarantine in designated hotels.China’s civil aviation ministry said Thursday it would limit passenger numbers on inbound international flights, and said airlines must have their schedules pre-approved by the ministry.Thousands of passenger flights have already been cancelled globally as carriers slash routes in the face of sweeping travel restrictions and plunging demand.The Civil Aviation Administration also said some international flights to Beijing would be directed to other cities where passengers would go through medical screening and customs before re-embarking on their original flight to the capital.The National Health Commission said there were 34 more cases brought in from abroad, the biggest daily increase in two weeks, with 189 in total now.“We should never allow the hard-won and continuous positive trend to be reversed,” Xi said at a Communist Party leadership meeting on Wednesday. The disease is believed to have jumped from an animal to humans at a market that illegally sold wild game in Wuhan late last year.There have also been questions about China’s official figures, as authorities changed their methodology to count infections, and the government has endured rare public criticism of its handling of the health emergency.Local officials initially attempted to cover up the outbreak, with police silencing doctors who had raised the alarm about the emergence of the new virus as early as December.One of the whistleblowers, Wuhan ophthalmologist Li Wenliang, died from the virus himself in February, sparking an outpouring of grief and anger on social media.The first case emerged in Wuhan on December 1, according to Chinese researchers, but it was not until January 9 the country confirmed a “new type of coronavirus”.Between January 5 and 17, China reported no new cases of the virus, even as Japan and Thailand declared their first infections -- a period that coincided with annual political meetings in Wuhan and Hubei province.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-reports-zero-new-domestic-coronavirus-cases-for-first-time/story-M6JhnDLQlpOYMsAvxvsOYL.html

19-03-2020||World||About 25 mn jobs could be lost worldwide due to coronavirus: UN agency||Nearly 25 million jobs could be lost worldwide due to the coronavirus pandemic, but an internationally coordinated policy response can help lower the impact on global unemployment, according to a UN agency. In its preliminary assessment report titled “COVID-19 and world of work: Impacts and responses”, the International Labour Organization (ILO) calls for urgent, large-scale and coordinated measures across three pillars - protecting workers in the workplace, stimulating the economy and employment, and supporting jobs and incomes. The ILO said these measures include extending social protection, supporting employment retention (i.e short-time work, paid leave, other subsidies), and financial and tax relief, including for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises. It also proposes fiscal and monetary policy measures, and lending and financial support for specific economic sectors. The economic and labour crisis created by the COVID-19 pandemic could increase global unemployment by almost 25 million, the ILO said. “However, if we see an internationally coordinated policy response, as happened in the global financial crisis of 2008/9, then the impact on global unemployment could be significantly lower,” it added. The report provides different scenarios of how unemployment and underemployment will be impacted due to the coronavirus. Based on different scenarios for the impact of COVID-19 on global GDP growth, the ILO estimates indicate a rise in global unemployment of between 5.3 million (“low” scenario) and 24.7 million (“high” scenario) from a base level of 188 million in 2019. By comparison, the 2008-09 global financial crisis increased global unemployment by 22 million. Underemployment is also expected to increase on a large scale, as the economic consequences of the virus outbreak translate into reductions in working hours and wages. Self-employment in developing countries, which often serves to cushion the impact of changes, may not do so this time because of restrictions on the movement of people (eg service providers) and goods, it said. The note said that falls in employment also meant large income losses for workers to the tune of between USD 860 billion and USD 3.4 trillion by the end of 2020. This will translate into falls in consumption of goods and services, in turn affecting the prospects for businesses and economies. Working poverty is expected to increase significantly too, as “the strain on incomes resulting from the decline in economic activity will devastate workers close to or below the poverty line,” the ILO said. It estimates that between 8.8 and 35 million additional people will be in working poverty worldwide, compared to the original estimate for 2020 (which projected a decline of 14 million worldwide). Underscoring the need for swift and coordinated policy responses, ILO Director-General Guy Ryder said “this is no longer only a global health crisis, it is also a major labour market and economic crisis that is having a huge impact on people.” “In 2008, the world presented a united front to address the consequences of the global financial crisis, and the worst was averted. We need that kind of leadership and resolve now,” he added. The ILO note warns that certain groups will be disproportionately affected by the jobs crisis, which could increase inequality. These include people in less protected and low-paid jobs, particularly youth and older workers and women and migrants too, who are vulnerable due to the lack of social protection and rights, and women tend to be over-represented in low-paid jobs and affected sectors. “In times of crisis like the current one, we have two key tools that can help mitigate the damage and restore public confidence. Firstly, social dialogue, engaging with workers and employers and their representatives, is vital for building public trust and support for the measures that we need to overcome this crisis. “Secondly, international labour standards provide a tried-and-trusted foundation for policy responses that focus on a recovery that is sustainable and equitable. Everything needs to be done to minimise the damage to people at this difficult time,” Ryder said. The coronavirus outbreak has killed 8,809 people and infected 218,631 across 157 countries and territories, according to a tracker maintained by Johns Hopkins University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/about-25-mn-jobs-could-be-lost-worldwide-due-to-coronavirus-un-agency/story-smqd4EXq9e8BCYtYJ6tAQK.html
19-03-2020||World||First coronavirus death in Sub-Saharan Africa as WHO warns ‘prepare for worst’||Sub-Saharan Africa has recorded its first COVID-19 death, a high-ranking politician in Burkina Faso, as the head of the World Health Organisation urged the continent to “prepare for the worst”.“Africa should wake up,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a news conference in Geneva on Wednesday, pointing out that “in other countries, we have seen how the virus actually accelerates after a certain tipping point”.Africa has lagged behind the global curve for coronavirus infections and deaths, but in the past few days has seen a significant rise in cases.Experts have repeatedly warned about the perils for the continent, given its weak health infrastructure, poverty, conflicts, poor sanitation and urban crowding.Medical authorities in the poor Sahel state of Burkina Faso announced Wednesday that the number of infections there had risen by seven to 27 -- and that one of them, a 62-year-old diabetic woman, had died overnight. The country’s main opposition party, the Union for Progress and Change (UPC), said in a statement that the victim was its lawmaker Rose-Marie Compaore, the first vice president of the parliament.South Africa, the continent’s most industrialised economy, reported a more than one-third jump in cases, with 31 new infections bringing its tally to 116. Nearby Zambia announced its first two confirmed cases -- a couple that returned to the capital Lusaka from a 10-day holiday in France.As of Wednesday, a tally of reported cases compiled by AFP stood at more than 600 for all of Africa.Of these, 16 cases have been fatal: six in Egypt, six in Algeria, two in Morocco, one in Sudan and one in Burkina Faso.Those figures are relatively small compared to the rest of world -- the global death toll has passed 8,800 with almost 210,000 total infections.WHO chief Tedros said sub-Saharan Africa had recorded 233 infections, but warned the official numbers likely did not reflect the full picture.“Probably we have undetected cases or unreported cases,” he said.‘We live day-to-day’Watching from afar as disaster unfolds in Asia and Europe, some African countries have wasted little time in ordering drastic measures.Air traffic has been particularly hard hit, as many of Africa’s initial cases were detected in people who had returned from affected countries in Europe and the Middle East.Some countries, such as Somalia, Chad, Guinea-Bissau and, most recently, the island of Madagascar have moved to stop all flights into their countries.On Wednesday, Cape Verde -- a tropical archipelago off Africa’s west coast that is heavily dependent on tourism -- and the continent’s most populous nation, Nigeria, joined others in banning flights from the countries most affected by coronavirus.Burkina Faso has ordered the closure of all schools and barred all public and private gatherings until the end of April.There was concern on the unusually quiet streets of the capital Ouagadougou on Wednesday.“It’s worrying what is happening with this virus, but we cannot barricade ourselves like developed countries. We lack everything here -- we live day-to-day,” said bicycle seller Boureima Baguian.“We cannot, for example, close the big market. If that happens, it’s not the coronavirus that will kill us but misery and hunger.”The Democratic Republic of Congo announced similar measures as it reported its first local case, banning flights from affected countries and closing schools and universities for four weeks.South Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa’s worst-hit country, has banned cruise ships from its ports. More than 1,700 people are stranded on a liner off Cape Town over fears that some have the virus.It is just the latest blow to tourism across the continent, with coronavirus fears also cancelling sporting, cultural and religious events.Christian and Muslim leaders in Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast and Senegal said they would suspend services to protect their faithful.‘Disease hot spot’A 2016 analysis by the Rand Corporation, a US think-tank, found that of the 25 countries in the world that were most vulnerable to infectious outbreaks, 22 were in Africa -- the others were Afghanistan, Yemen and Haiti.The report identified a “disease hotspot belt” extending across the southern rim of the Sahara through the Sahel to the Horn of Africa, where many countries are struggling with conflicts.“Were a communicable disease to emerge within this chain of countries, it could easily spread across borders in all directions, abetted by high overall vulnerability and a string of weak national health systems along the way,” the report warned.Tedros recommended that mass gatherings be avoided, urging Africa to “cut it from the bud, expecting that the worst can happen”.“The best advice for Africa is to prepare for the worst and prepare today,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-coronavirus-death-in-sub-saharan-africa-as-who-warns-prepare-for-worst/story-Gtb7CmEMrbME4O3ZSzeGuO.html
19-03-2020||World||Two US Congress members test positive for coronavirus||Two US lawmakers including a Florida representative on Wednesday became the first members of Congress to announce they have tested positive for the novel coronavirus.Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart’s office said in a statement that “just a short while ago, he was notified that he has tested positive for COVID-19.”The Republican who represents part of Miami follows that city’s Mayor Francis Suarez, who announced that he had tested positive for coronavirus last week.They are following CDC-specified self-isolation guidelines at their homes.Diaz-Balart’s diagnosis prompted a member of congressional leadership, the number two Republican Steve Scalise, to immediately self-quarantine as he had an extended meeting with his colleague last week.“Fortunately, I am not experiencing any symptoms, and will continue working remotely on Congress’s Coronavirus response” and remain in close contact with Trump administration officials to ensure that swift action to address the crisis continues, Scalise said in a statement.In the western state of Utah, Democrat Ben McAdams became the second congressman to announce he tested positive.After developing a mild cold Saturday evening when he returned from Washington, “my symptoms got worse and I developed a fever, a dry cough, labored breathing and I remained self-quarantined,” McAdams said.He was tested Tuesday, received a positive diagnosis Wednesday, and remains in isolation at home, he said.The attending physician of the US Congress said in a statement released by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that Diaz-Balart and McAdams “are ill, but in good condition.” They are following self-isolation guidelines set forth by US health officials, he added.Diaz-Balart said that he had entered into quarantine and was working from his Washington apartment.“I want everyone to know that I am feeling much better,” he said. “However, it is important that everyone take this extremely seriously and follow CDC guidelines in order to avoid getting sick and mitigate the spread of this virus.”Several US lawmakers have self-quarantined after coming in contact with a man who attended a conservative conference near Washington shortly before he tested positive for coronavirus. The United States so far has more than 9,300 cases and 150 deaths, according to a Johns Hopkins University tracker.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-us-congress-members-test-positive-for-coronavirus/story-s6ugjCwA1eJZM0ovVYRfHK.html
19-03-2020||World||US President Donald Trump signs $100 billion coronavirus relief package||US President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed a $100-billion emergency aid package that ensures sick leave to Americans workers who fall ill from the new coronavirus, with more federal assistance in the pipeline.The bipartisan House-passed measure easily cleared the Senate by a vote of 90 to eight earlier Wednesday. Hours later Trump said in a statement that he signed the legislation into law, providing a rare example of Congressional Democrats, Republicans and the presidency working together quickly during his administration.It provides for free coronavirus testing for those who need it, sick pay and paid family leave, and bolsters unemployment insurance for millions of Americans.The legislation aims to strengthen protections in the face of a global health crisis that has already killed more than 110 people in the United States, where more than 7,300 cases have been confirmed.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, speaking moments after the vote, called it “a very important” step.The so-called Phase Two bill is the second emergency congressional aid package related to coronavirus, following an initial $8.3 billion measure passed early this month.McConnell acknowledged the urgent need to get relief to workers, but stressed he would compel the chamber to stay in session until a broader, Phase Three relief package is completed.“I will not adjourn the Senate until we have passed a far bolder package that must include significant relief for small businesses all across our country,” McConnell said.“Just how long it will take to go through these steps is unclear,” he added. “We are moving rapidly because the situation demands it.”The White House and lawmakers are negotiating a $1.3 trillion package -- among the largest federal emergency plans ever -- that reportedly would include up to $500 billion in direct check payments to Americans, and $300 billion in loans to small businesses.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said it would also include $300 billion in deferred tax payments.Senate precautions Wednesday’s vote took place under extraordinary circumstances, with roll calls extended to 30 minutes to allow senators to comply with US health precautions, including keeping a safe distance from each other.“Be aware of the social distancing... as we come over to the chamber and as we depart,” McConnell told colleagues, urging against congregating on the Senate floor.The vote came after Mnuchin went to the US Capitol to appease concerns by some Senate Republicans about the ramifications that sick and family leave could have on small businesses that are already suffering economically from the crisis.“This is literally the worst time in living memory to pile even more burdens and costs onto small businesses, which are themselves fighting to stay alive, unless we back it up with major assistance,” McConnell said.Top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer called for immediate negotiations on the stimulus.He said Democrats are proposing a “Marshall plan” reminiscent of World War II-era reconstruction, but for US health infrastructure.It prioritizes public health capacity, unemployment insurance, paid sick leave and priority treatment for labor in any industry bailout.Joe Biden, the frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination, highlighted the lack of sick leave for many workers as a glaring shortcoming of the US labor system.“It is a national disgrace that millions of Americans do not have a single day of paid sick leave,” the former vice president said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-donald-trump-signs-100-billion-coronavirus-relief-package/story-KTFnI9APSaPArHTGeMcyuN.html
19-03-2020||World||‘Behave more responsibly’: US issues Covid-19 warning to the young||As the United States witnessed a surge in coronavirus infections and fatalities, the White House on Wednesday warned young people that they may not be as resistant to the virus as earlier believed, and appealed to them to behave more responsibly for their own sake and the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions.Tracking Coronavirus Outbreak: Live UpdatesUS public health officials, experts and media commentators have expressed frustration and annoyance with a widespread display of indifference from younger people, as captured in visuals running non-stop on some TV channels of a crowded beach in Florida, to the dangers of the outbreak and recommended precautions.Police officers have had to move in to shut down bars and restaurants that have continued to attract customers that are mostly young.The elderly, mostly those 60 and older, and those with pre-existing conditions such as diabetes, and heart and lung ailments are said to be the most vulnerable, and at the highest risk of the new coronavirus infection, according to all advance warnings, including from America’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).“There are concerning reports coming out of France and Italy about some young people getting seriously ill, and very seriously ill in the ICUs,” said Dr Deborah Leah Birx, coronavirus response coordinator for the White House Task appointed by President Donald Trump.Earlier assumptions about the elderly and those with underlying conditions being most at risk were based on “early data” coming out of China and South Korea, she addedat a news briefing at the White House flanked by President Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and top health officials.Dr Birx did not cite new data or specific information to back up her alarm about the vulnerability of young people, and acknowledged as much. “We have not seen any significant mortality in the children, but we are concerned about the early reports coming out of Italy and France,” she said.The United States has shut down its schools and colleges, and bars and restaurants; prohibited large gatherings; and banned travellers from China, South Korea, Iran, Europe, Mexico, and, starting Wednesday, Canada in an aggressive bid to prevent the spread and new infusion of the virus.The administration and congress have also worked expeditiously to provide financial cushion to businesses, large and small, and individuals impacted by the outbreak amidst dire forecast of a recession worse than those in near memory, including that in the aftermath of the September 9, 2001 attacks and the 2008 economic crash.“We cannot have these large gatherings that continue to occur throughout the country for people who are off work, to then be socialising in large groups and spreading the virus,” said Dr Birx in the most blunt message yet to this group of most unconsciously vulnerable population. “You have the potential then to spread it to someone who does have a condition that none of us knew about and cause them to have a disastrous outcome.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/behave-more-responsibly-us-issues-covid-19-warning-to-the-young/story-myV5FYQ380kujlWISWysBN.html
19-03-2020||World||Trump calls himself ‘wartime president’, deploys military hospital ships to fight coronavirus||The United States is to deploy military hospital ships to fight the coronavirus, Donald Trump said Wednesday, as he likened himself to a “wartime president” and invoked a Korean War-era law.As America and Canada announced they were closing their border to non-essential travelers, New York governor Andrew Cuomo said Trump was dispatching the navy’s 1,000-room USNS Comfort to the city’s harbor.The moves came as the number of deaths in the United States from COVID-19, the illness caused by the new coronavirus, reached 150, with confirmed cases soaring to more than 9,300, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally. US stocks suffered deep losses as Trump tried to downplay fears that the unemployment rate in the world’s number one power could spike to 20 percent because of the fast-spreading epidemic.Meanwhile America’s “Big Three” car makers -- General Motors, Fiat Chrysler and Ford -- announced that they would halt operations throughout North America through the end of the month.Cuomo said Trump had told him that the 894-foot (270-meter) Comfort ship would be sent to New York “immediately,” although it was not clear when the military vessel would dock in the US financial capital.“It’s an extraordinary step,” Cuomo told reporters, adding that it had around 1,000 rooms, including “operating rooms.”“It’s literally a floating hospital, which will add capacity,” he added at the press conference. Cuomo said he and Trump agreed on the approach to containing the pandemic which has killed over 8,000 people worldwide and brought cities grinding to a halt.‘Invisible enemy’ Trump meanwhile told reporters that he viewed himself as “a wartime president. I mean, that’s what we’re fighting. I mean, it’s a very tough situation here.”He added that the United States would “defeat the invisible enemy,” and do it “even faster than we thought.Later in the day, he also signed a $100-billion emergency aid package that ensures sick leave to Americans workers who fall ill from the new coronavirus, in a rare example of congressional Democrats, Republicans and the presidency working together.Two lawmakers, Florida Republican Mario Diaz-Balart and Utah Democrat Ben McAdams, meanwhile became the first known members of Congress to have coronavirus, announcing on Twitter that they had tested positive.As well as the Comfort, Trump said that the USNS Mercy hospital ship would also be deployed.The governors of California and Washington state quickly called for it to be dispatched to their shores.Jay Inslee, governor of Washington, which has been heavily hit by the coronavirus, urged authorities to send it to Puget Sound: “We think that is the right deployment decision because we are the epicenter of this epidemic. And our medical system will be the first one that is stressed,” he said.Navy Spokesman Samuel Boyle said the boats would not treat COVID-19 patients directly but would assist the treatment of other patients in coastal locations where doctors and nurses are focused on the virus.A defense department source told AFP that the Comfort’s readiness to sail would be “more like weeks than days.”Trump also invoked the Defense Production Act, signed in 1950 during the Korean War, allowing the government to compel businesses to sign contracts and thus expand production. It is expected to help speed up production of protective masks and other equipment for medical personnel.Elsewhere, the Food and Drug Administration said it was investigating rolling out self-swab kits, where citizens test themselves, and Vice President Mike Pence called on hospitals to delay elective surgery.Deborah Birx, the coronavirus taskforce administrator, warned of a dramatic increase in cases as testing ramps up in the coming days, and forecast that the number of cases will exceed Italy’s.“Our curves will not be stable until sometime next week,” she said.Earlier Wednesday, Trump announced the closure of the US-Canada border to non-essential traffic as the coronavirus epidemic intensified in both countries -- but said that trade would not be impacted.He said he hoped it would open in 30 days, as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Can$27 billion (US$18.6 billion) in direct aid to help workers and businesses cope with the economic impact of the pandemic.On Wall Street Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was hit by another brutal loss to finish below the 20,000-point level for the first time since 2017 despite authorities in the US and elsewhere moving forward with more measures to prop up the economy.Trump said warnings by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that the jobless rate could reach 20 percent without a massive government stimulus program was “an absolute total worst-case scenario.”In New York, Cuomo announced that he was barring all non-essential businesses from having more than 50 percent of the workforce work outside of their home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-calls-himself-wartime-president-deploys-military-hospital-ships-to-fight-coronavirus/story-evEkhbryQUd60q1ceqXZXK.html
19-03-2020||World||China reports zero new domestic coronavirus cases for 1st time since outbreak||China on Thursday reported zero new local infection of the novel coronavirus in the past 24 hours, for the first time since the Covid-19 crisis broke out, a turning point in Beijing’s fight against the outbreak that has killed and sickened more than 81,000 in the country and hammered its economy.Globally, the disease continues to spread with nearly 9,000 dead and over 2,19,000 infected. Tracking Coronavirus Outbreak: Live UpdatesOfficials said on Thursday all the 34 cases reported in China until Wednesday midnight were imported cases - infected people who had returned to the country from abroad.Their nationalities were not shared by the health authorities. At least eight persons died of the disease on Wednesday, health officials said, adding that all the deaths were in the worst-hit central Chinese province of Hubei.“No new infections of the novel coronavirus were reported on Wednesday in Wuhan, the epicentre of the epidemic, marking a notable first in the city’s months-long battle with the microscopic foe,” the official news agency, Xinhua said in a report on Thursday morning.“With no new cases in Wuhan, the Chinese mainland on Wednesday reduced the increase in domestic transmissions to zero. The country now faces a greater threat of infections imported from overseas, which jumped by 34 on Wednesday,” the report said.Previously, the central Chinese province had reported single-digit increases of new infections, all of which were from Wuhan, for a week in a row since last Wednesday. A month ago, the figure was several thousand cases a day; hundreds of deaths were being reported.China’s imported coronavirus cases have been more than local transmissions for several days now as infected travellers passed through major transport hubs in Beijing, Shanghai and the southern cities of Guangzhou and Shenzhen.Of the 34 newly diagnosed imported cases, 21 were reported in Beijing, nine in the southern province of Guangdong, two in Shanghai, 1 in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang, and one in Zhejiang in eastern China.As on March 18 midnight, a total of 189 overseas confirmed cases were reported.The slowing down of new cases on the mainland is an indication that the spread of the infection has been suppressed in the country.The first cases Covid-19 were reported from Wuhan in December – even by November according to reports – and then spread to the rest of China.The first cluster of cases was linked to a seafood and meat market in Wuhan, which also traded in wild animals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-reports-zero-new-local-coronavirus-case-for-the-first-time-since-outbreak/story-8xLDjMBBgsiS3FoARHTLvM.html
19-03-2020||World||103-year-old Iran woman recovers from coronavirus: Report||A 103-year-old woman in Iran has recovered after being infected with the new coronavirus, state media reported, despite overwhelming evidence the elderly are most at risk from the disease.The unnamed woman had been hospitalised in the central city of Semnan for about a week, IRNA news agency said.But she was “discharged after making a complete recovery”, Semnan University of Medical Sciences head Navid Danayi was quoted as saying by IRNA late Tuesday.The woman was the second elderly patient in Iran to have survived the disease.The other was a 91-year-old man from Kerman, in the southeast of Iran, the news agency said.After being sick for three days, he recovered on Monday despite having pre-existing medical conditions including high blood pressure and asthma, it added.The report did not say how the pair were treated.Since Iran announced its first deaths on February 19, the novel coronavirus has spread to all of the country’s 31 provinces and killed nearly 1,000 people.The elderly are the most vulnerable to the disease, which first emerged in China late last year.The World Health Organization this month estimated the novel coronavirus kills 3.4 per cent of all those infected.But for people aged over 80 the fatality rate was 21.9 per cent, according to a report the WHO carried out with the Chinese authorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/103-year-old-iran-woman-recovers-from-coronavirus-report/story-S3dLMTuDLrK4cLasQuvFtL.html
19-03-2020||World||NYSE to shut trading floors from Monday after 2 test positive for coronavirus||The New York Stock Exchange will temporarily shut its trading floors starting Monday and move to fully electronic trading after an employee and a person who worked on the floor both tested positive for coronavirus this week.The exchange’s equities and options trading floors in New York will close, as will its options trading pit in San Francisco, according to a statement by NYSE owner Intercontinental Exchange Inc.The company said in a notice to traders that two individuals were screened on Monday and tested positive for coronavirus. The NYSE employee and the person who worked on the trading floor both were barred from entering the building this week and were last inside on Friday.“Our markets are fully capable of operating in an all-electronic fashion to serve all participants, and we will proceed in that manner until we can re-open our trading floors to our members,” said NYSE President Stacey Cunningham. “While we are taking the precautionary step of closing the trading floors, we continue to firmly believe the markets should remain open and accessible to investors. All NYSE markets will continue to operate under normal trading hours despite the closure of the trading floors.”The site will remain open this week. On Tuesday, it was “thoroughly sanitized using treatments recommended by federal agencies” and will be again Wednesday evening.“This is a big deal,” said independent analyst Larry Tabb. “The question is, does the floor provide a differentiated process or just differentiated marketing? I guess we will find out, if after this is over, the floor opens back up, or if they stay electronic and save the tremendous cost of operating.”The U.S. equity market closed for two days in 2012 in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. NYSE had previously shut for four trading days after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.Wild swings in equity markets and thousands in the financial industry working from home have led to questions about whether stock exchanges should remain open. But top regulators -- including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton -- and executives of exchange firms have come out in favor of keeping markets open.The NYSE is home to 25% of share-trading for companies listed there. It also hosts more than 36% of block trades comprising 10,000 shares or more, according to the company.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nyse-to-shut-trading-floors-from-monday-after-2-test-positive-for-coronavirus/story-ivVPA6vAJbm7xNMU7Acd6L.html
19-03-2020||World||Coronavirus triggers border shutdowns||European Union leaders agreed to restrict most travel into the continent in an unprecedented move aimed at slowing down the spread of the deadly coronavirus pandemic and curbing its effects on the bloc.Soon after the move was announced, the global death toll crossed 8,000 and the total number of infections surpassed 200,000. Europe has now recorded over 3,400 deaths, leapfrogging Asia’s 3,380 fatalities. Italy on Wednesday reported 475 new deaths, the highest one-day official toll of any nation since the first case was detected in China late last year. Total deaths in Italy have reached 2,978, more than half of all the cases recorded outside China, while the number of infections stood at 35,713.The EU’s new restrictions will apply to all non-EU citizens and last for an initial 30 days, German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters after a video conference. She said that the group expressed a “great readiness” to do whatever is necessary to contain the outbreak.Banning all travel to foreign nationals adds to a series of restrictive measures that would have been unthinkable in western democracies only a few weeks ago. Several EU member states have imposed curfews and lockdowns, shutting shops, bars, schools, and restaurants in a last-ditch effort to stop the disease from overwhelming the continent’s healthcare systems.While the moves are deemed essential by many epidemiologists, they are bound to deal a severe blow to the European and global economies. EU governments officially acknowledge the bloc is heading to a recession this year - the first since the sovereign debt crisis.The sealing of Europe’s external border is aimed at lifting an ever-growing number of internal border closings, which have disrupted free movement within the bloc - one of the key pillars of European integration. 850 million students not at school: UNESCOMore than 850 million young people, or nearly half the world’s student population, are barred from their school and university grounds because of the coronavirus pandemic, the Unesco said. Calling it an “unprecedented challenge” for education, Unesco said schools had been closed in 102 countries.Pakistan reports first fatalityPakistan on Wednesday confirmed its first death from coronavirus as the total number of infected patients in the country climbed to 260, the health minister said on Twitter. The death was reported in northwest Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where so far 19 cases of have been confirmed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-triggers-border-shutdowns/story-4WxSiydYX5RqetCbZqkT9I.html
