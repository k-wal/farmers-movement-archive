This takes total cases of coronavirus to 7,161, with 237 deaths, the health ministry spokesman said.Judiciary chief Ebrahim Raisi announced the temporary release of prisoners as Iranian authorities seek to counter one of the worst national outbreaks outside China, where the new virus originated, and one of the highest death rates from the illness.Raisi said the release of prisoners would continue “to the point where it doesn’t create insecurity in society”, according to the Mizan news site of the judiciary.He did not give further details or specify when those released would have to return to jail.Officials have expressed concern about the possibility of infections spreading during Nowruz, the beginning of the Iranian new year on March 20 which is usually a period where families travel to vacation spots around the country.The health ministry has told Iranians to stay home and imposed restrictions on travel between provinces.Despite the warnings, however, authorities have said there has been heavy traffic in recent days on roads headed north to the Caspian Sea, a traditional Nowruz vacation spot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/interim-freedom-for-prisoners-as-iran-issues-release-order-due-to-coronavirus/story-EF3kXuZeYrlrV3y4r3gGQO.html

Four people have died and 310 have tested positive in the UK.The queen is the head of Commonwealth, and the UK is the current chair-in-office of the group with 54 countries as members. India is the largest country in the group by population, and the third largest by size after Canada and Australia.The couple will stop using royal titles from March 31 and stop receiving public money as part of an arrangement reached with the Queen. The arrangement is to be reviewed after one year. Any future attendance by them at royal events will not be classified as official duties.Prince Harry will also step down as the Commonwealth Youth Ambassador, the role he took on during the 2018 meeting of Commonwealth heads of government in London, but will continue to be the president of the Queens Commonwealth Trust.Speaking on the occasion, PM Johnson said: “The Commonwealth has over 70 years of history as a driver for peace, democracy and human rights around the world. It gives a voice to its member states and the 2.4 billion Commonwealth citizens around the world.“Over 60% of those citizens are under 30 years old and it is for them in particular we must look, not just to the past successes of the Commonwealth, but to its future. With the world facing increasingly difficult challenges from climate change to global health security, we need the cooperation and understanding that the Commonwealth brings more than ever”.After the service, the Prince Harry and Meghan Markle keen to live a life away from the royal family, were expected to return to their new home in Canada. They have announced plans to live a life of personal independence, pursuing private commercial deals and charity projects.The couple, who have been on a farewell tour of the UK, appearing at various events, will continue to have the use of Frogmore Cottage in Windsor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/commonwealth-day-marks-prince-harry-and-meghan-s-last-official-event-as-senior-uk-royals/story-43K6ri0BSGnPzROUfP9ddL.html
09-03-2020||World||‘Manipulated media’: Twitter on video shared by Trump ahead of battle for 6 states||Twitter fact-checked a video re-tweeted by President Donald Trump Sunday and labelled it “manipulated media”, as Democrats prepared for nominating contests in six states on Tuesday with former Vice-President Joe Biden expecting to widen his lead over Senator Bernie Sanders.Trump had retweeted the video posted by White House director of social media Dan Scavino. The video wrongly showed Biden as saying, “...we can only re-elect Donald Trump”. The clip edited out the rest of the quote. “We can only re-elect Donald Trump, if in fact we get engaged in this circular firing squad here,” Biden had said. He used the same phrase his former boss Barack Obama used last April while commenting on internal rife among Democrats.This comes in the light of social media giants like Facebook and Twitter facing growing criticism for allowing their platforms to be used to publish and transmit false information. Twitter will use the label of “manipulated media”, it has said, for content “that have been deceptively altered or fabricated”.Multiple US media publications are also independently keeping a check on President Trump’s remarks and social media posts. Accroding to The Washington Post’s column ‘Fact-Checker’, the US president has made 16,231 false or misleading claims so far.The Sunday re-tweet from the president came as part of his efforts to insinuate himself in the Democratic race by belittling, mocking and inciting other candidates.The focus of the nominating contests is now on six states that go to polls Tuesday — Michigan, Washington (state), North Dakota, Idaho, Mississippi and Missouri. All eyes are on Michigan, a key state.Heading into these primaries, Biden picked up the endorsement of one more of his erstwhile rivals for the nomination, Senator Cory Booker, taking his lead to 7-0 over Sanders. The former vice-president is expected to present Booker and senator Kamal Harris, who announced her endorsement Sunday, at a poll-eve event Monday on the eve of the Tuesday polling.Biden is leading Sanders 50.3% to 35.3% in the RealClearPolitics average of polls, and 664 to 573 in the count of delegates, with the winning target being 1,991 delegates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/manipulated-media-twitter-on-video-shared-by-trump-ahead-of-battle-for-6-states/story-EzrxtGRwt3pI0x5eNQJo0M.html

Prior to the nuclear deal, in 2013, Iran’s stockpile of enriched uranium was already more than 7,000 kilograms (7.72 tons) with higher enrichment, but it didn’t pursue a bomb.The JCPOA, signed by Iran with the U.S., Germany, France, Britain, China and Russia, allows a stockpile of only 202.8 kilograms of low-enriched uranium.The JCPOA promised Iran economic incentives in return for the curbs on its nuclear program, but since President Donald Trump pulled the U.S. out of the deal unilaterally in 2018 and imposed new sanctions, the country’s economy has been struggling.Its violations of the pact are intended to pressure the other nations involved to increase economic incentives to make up for the American sanctions. So far, attempts by the other members of the JCPOA have fallen short of Iran’s demands.In a separate report to members last week, the IAEA said it had identified three locations in Iran where the country possibly stored undeclared nuclear material or undertook nuclear-related activities without declaring it to international observers.The activities at those locations are believed to have dated from the early 2000s, before the nuclear deal, and Iran responded to the report by suggesting that the IAEA had no legal basis to inspect those sites.In his speech to the board members, Grossi called on “Iran to cooperate immediately and fully with the agency, including by providing prompt access to the locations specified by the agency.”“The agency has identified a number of questions related to possible undeclared nuclear material and nuclear-related activities at three locations that have not been declared by Iran,” Grossi said, according to his prepared remarks. “The agency sought access to two of the locations. Iran has not provided access to these locations and has not engaged in substantive discussions to clarify the agency’s questions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-providing-access-to-active-nuclear-sites-says-un-s-atomic-watchdog/story-8vPte0oghWo7FD8QxFzVXI.html

Jails have been ordered to stop all visits and limit day releases. Rights campaigners warned of mass revolts over the new measures, and families gathered outside prisons to protest the restrictions -- and to get news of their loved ones. Around a dozen prisoners at the San Vittore prison in Milan managed to climb onto the roof of one of the wings and shouted slogans as the police and prison guards below looked on. It was the second day of unrest following revolts in at least 10 jails across the country Sunday, from Bergamo, Venice and Modena in the north, to Bari and Naples in the south. Prison guard union SPP said at least 23 prisons had been involved in protests between Sunday and Monday, amid frustration over measures aimed at preventing the virus entering the prison system. At least three inmates died during or following the clashes at the Modena Sant’Anna jail, according to prisoner rights group Antigone. The Repubblica daily reported six deaths, citing police sources. Italian news agency ANSA said there were eight deaths, with two having died in other jails after being transferred from Modena. It said there were reports the prisoners had broken into a medical centre in the Modena jail and had overdosed. Authorities in Modena would not immediately confirm the reports. At San Vittore, the prisoners perched precariously on the roof tiles wore bandannas or scarves over their faces. Fellow inmates could be seen massed around the barred windows at the jail in the Italian capital. Relatives rallied outside many of the concerned jails in protest over the measures, including a ban on family visits. “We’re urging inmates and relatives to stop violent protests, as they could spark others,” Antigone’s Andrea Oleandri said. “The situation could rapidly deteriorate.” Prisoners, who get most of their information from televisions, tended to protest in solidarity if they saw convicts in other jails rioting, he added. Family members desperate for news of their loved ones Monday had to be held off by prison guards at the entrance to the Modena jail, as ambulances and prison vans came and went, an AFP photographer said. “This rumpus, this ‘war’ happened because the inmates hadn’t been given any information about what was going on outside, and visitor visits had been suspended,” said Gilberto, the father of one prisoner who did not want to give his last name. “No-one’s telling us who’s died, who is injured, or why they died and why they were injured,” the 59-year old told AFP. Italy’s prisons suffering from overcrowding, with over 61,000 inmates locked up in spaces designed to hold just 51,000. The country has been hard hit by the virus -- with some 366 victims so far -- and the government has imposed draconian measures to stop it spreading further, including placing large swathes of the north under lockdown. As well as halting visits and limiting day releases, all prison staff are supposed to have their temperatures checked on arrival each day. Medical checks for incoming inmates have also been ramped up, Antigone said. “The prisoners are worried the virus will get into jail and spread,” Oleandri said. “They are in confined spaces. There are usually two or three people in a 12-metre square cell. And while visits have been suspended, there are still lots of people coming and going,” he said. Antigone has called for more inmates with only a short time left to serve to be allowed to do so at home, reducing the numbers behind bars.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prisoners-on-roof-fatalities-as-italy-jails-protest-coronavirus-restrictions/story-QBbRWCauceNaSbNDhty1RL.html

Armed officers responded. Taser and a police firearm were discharged during the incident,” it said in a statement.“London Ambulance Service attended and the man was pronounced dead at the scene... The incident is not being treated as terrorism.”The police said the shooting took place near Great Scotland Yard, an area housing government departments.Britain has been in the grip of a debate about rising knife crime, particularly in London, and two recent attacks in the capital had raised fears of terror attacks.In February, two people were stabbed on a busy high street in the Streatham area of south London. In November last year, two people were killed in the London Bridge area.On both occasions, the attackers were wearing fake suicide vests.Security has also been tightened around Britain’s parliament at Westminster after an attack in 2017 that killed five people on Westminster Bridge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/another-knife-attack-foiled-in-london-knifeman-shot-dead-near-parliament/story-URpsXyVGDmRWCVWEt63hUM.html

09-03-2020||World||Why did Boeing’s warning on 737 Max fail to stop a second crash?||Eight days after a Boeing Co. 737 Max went down in the Java Sea, killing all aboard, the planemaker issued a worldwide warning to pilots identifying the malfunction that triggered the crash.The bulletin, which was followed almost immediately by a similar notice from U.S. regulators, listed the symptoms cockpit crews faced in such an emergency and explained how to counteract it. News reports described the problem.Yet less than five months later a second 737 Max went down, slamming into a field in Ethiopia, after suffering the same malfunction. As the one-year anniversary of that crash approaches, many questions remain about why the two pilots lost control.Was the bulletin’s technical language clear enough? Did Boeing and the regulators who signed off on the warning underestimate the chaos of alarms blaring in the cockpit of the doomed jet? Could the pilots have been fatigued or sick? Should, as one whistle-blower has suggested, Ethiopian pilots have gotten more training on the malfunction?“I think that’s a central question: Why?” said Jeffrey Guzzetti, the former head of the FAA’s accident investigation bureau. “There’s all kind of potential underlying threads.”A flaw in the design of the 737 Max has already been identified as a main reason for the crash of a Lion Air plane near Jakarta. The Ethiopian Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau hasn’t released its findings but a preliminary report out last April showed a similar malfunction also occurred on that flight.The Ethiopian investigators are poised to release an interim report on the March 10 crash in coming days. A draft of the report focuses on Boeing’s flawed design according to people who have seen it.Ethiopian government officials and the airline have steadfastly defended the pilots. Transport Minister Dagmawit Moges in April said they followed “all the procedures repeatedly.” Airline Chief Executive Officer Tewolde GebreMariam has bristled in interviews over implications that the crew didn’t perform properly.A committee of the U.S. Congress on Friday issued its own preliminary findings on the Max and said its design and development “was marred by technical design failures, lack of transparency with both regulators and customers, and efforts to obfuscate information about the operation of the aircraft.”Boeing added a flight-control feature called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS, which was programmed to automatically drive down the nose in some circumstances, without adequately assessing its risks, Indonesia’s National Transportation Safety Committee concluded in October.The company assumed pilots would respond to a malfunction of MCAS within four seconds, but the Lion Air crash and an incident on the same plane a day earlier showed that wasn’t realistic, the investigation found.Yet the environment was different for the Ethiopian crew.Boeing’s bulletin on Nov. 6, 2018, and an emergency directive by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration didn’t specifically name MCAS, but the system was widely identified in news reports within days.The bulletin listed nine possible symptoms in such a failure. If any of them occurred while the plane tried to nose down on its own, the directive said: “do the Runaway Stabilizer NNC ensuring that the STAB TRIM CUTOUT switches are set to CUTOUT and stay in the CUTOUT position for the remainder of the flight.”In the nomenclature of aviation, that meant perform an emergency checklist shutting off power to the motor driving down the nose and keep it off.The directive was made a part of the Ethiopian carrier’s manuals. Within two days of Boeing’s notice, a senior Ethiopian Airlines pilot had emailed the company’s crews to reiterate the warning, according to records reviewed by Bloomberg News.Teasing out clues for why Captain Yared Getachew and copilot Ahmed Nur Mohammod reacted the way they did is critical, according to several former crash investigators and safety experts. Not only will it help shed light on the grounded 737 Max’s flaws and whether initial warnings were adequate, but it also is relevant to broad issues of pilot training and competency, they said.According to the Ethiopian preliminary report, the pilots took several vexing actions.They performed an important step in Boeing’s recommended emergency response to the malfunction: shutting off power to the electric motor that was driving down their nose. But they then restored power shortly before losing control.They also left the plane’s throttle set to takeoff power, which prompted it to fly faster than its maximum allowable speed and made it far more difficult to control. Other actions, such as trying to activate the autopilot, appear to have been opposite of what they should have done in the emergency.It would be easy to simply point the finger at the pilots, but that doesn’t take into account the calamitous conditions in the cockpit, said John Cox, a former airline pilot and president of the consulting company Safety Operating Systems.A failed sensor was triggering multiple errors and warnings, including a loud thumping noise on the captain’s control column signaling -- falsely, it turned out -- the plane was nearing an aerodynamic stall. They also had unreliable airspeed and altitude readings.It’s unfair “sitting in an office saying they should have known” how to respond, Cox said. Investigators should examine how the chaos would have impacted the pilots’ performance, he said.Another area investigators should review is the adequacy of the Boeing bulletin, Cox said. While it mentioned the multiple failures that could occur at the same time, it didn’t expressly warn crews about how chaotic they could be, he said.Such pilot warnings have been criticized as inadequate in previous accidents, Guzzetti said.The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, for example, criticized the FAA for a similar type of warning it issued to pilots after an earlier model of the 737 crashed near Pittsburgh in 1994.“It should be something they are looking at,” Guzzetti said. “How effective was the wording, the presentation and the prioritization?”While it will be impossible to know exactly what Getachew and Nur were thinking during the frantic five-minute flight, crash investigations typically follow a basic script to get clues.They take a close look at pilots’ lives in the days prior to the crash for signs of illness, fatigue or other personal factors that could affect their actions.In the Lion Air crash, investigators found that the captain was sick and the copilot had been called in at 4 a.m. as a substitute for the scheduled crew member.The type of training that pilots received and how well they performed in their careers are also areas that can help investigators understand accidents.Nur, the 25-year-old Ethiopian copilot who was almost new to the plane, might get attention from investigators. He had only 361 hours of flying experience in his brief career and less in the 737: 56 hours in the Max and 151 hours in other models of the plane. He had been flying the aircraft for less than 90 days.Pilots’ training and skills have been relevant in multiple previous accidents.Both of the Lion Air pilots had exhibited problems in those areas, Indonesian investigators found. Most significantly, the copilot had had difficulty locating checklists and performing in emergency scenarios.A Canadian man who was a pilot for Ethiopian Airlines before resigning last year said he tried before the crash to warn the carrier that crews weren’t adequately prepared.In the months after the Lion Air accident, Bernd Kai von Hoesslin frequently quizzed copilots he worked alongside about the MCAS bulletin and most of them couldn’t answer detailed questions, he said in multiple interviews with Bloomberg News.The airline called von Hoesslin a disgruntled former employee and disputed his allegations in statements. The airline “strictly complies with all global safety standards and regulatory requirements,” it said in a Twitter post last year.Von Hoesslin submitted records to the U.S. NTSB, which is participating in the probe, but hasn’t been contacted by Ethiopian investigators, he said in an email.The quality of training at the airline should also be a part of the investigation, said Roger Cox, a former NTSB investigator and airline pilot.Representatives of the airline didn’t respond to requests for comment on this story.Were crews adequately taught to be comfortable flying a plane manually during an emergency? Were junior pilots coached to speak up when a captain made a mistake? Were they given realistic emergency scenarios during training?These are not just questions that could help explain why the Ethiopian crew lost control, but probing them for answers could help improve safety across the world, Cox said.“Have you done enough to ensure that those guys together have an adequate ability to handle an emergency?” he said. “It’s an extremely important question to ask.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-did-boeing-s-warning-on-737-max-fail-to-stop-a-second-crash/story-qwXWZ7N0bHJ79aAiJNLE3H.html

09-03-2020||World||Afghanistan’s duelling leaders to hold parallel presidential inaugurations||Afghanistan’s two rival leaders were preparing to hold parallel presidential inaugurations on Monday, after the pair failed to reach a deal in the face of a unified and resurgent Taliban.The spat has raised fears for Afghanistan’s fragile democracy as the US prepares to leave the country following an agreement with the insurgents last month, with President Donald Trump committed to ending America’s longest war.Polls were held in September but incumbent Ashraf Ghani was only declared to have won a second term in February after repeated delays and accusations of voter fraud, sparking a furious response by former chief executive Abdullah Abdullah, who vowed to form his own parallel government.Last-minute talks reportedly extended late into the night Sunday as the two sides sought to broker an agreement.But by Monday morning, there was little indication a solution had been found, with Ghani’s spokesman only announcing that his inauguration would be delayed by several hours.Abdullah’s spokesman Faraidoon Khwazoon told AFP the ceremony would go ahead as planned but cautioned: “Things can change”.Washington had earlier warned that the bickering posed a risk to the US withdrawal deal, which requires the Taliban to hold talks with Kabul.Widening divisions among Afghan politicians would leave the insurgents with the upper hand in those negotiations.Fight for power Their game of thrones has left many Afghans despairing for their country’s future, worried that Kabul’s politicians will be no match for the Taliban in any peace talks.“It is impossible to have two presidents in one country,” said Ahmad Jawed, 22, who urged the men “to put their personal interests aside and only think of their country instead of fighting for power”.He told AFP that “instead of holding oath-taking ceremonies they should talk to each other to find a solution”.Afghans have shown little enthusiasm for Abdullah, Ghani or the election process in general. Most of them abstained in last year’s lacklustre poll that saw candidates pitch few ideas or policies.Unemployment is high, and even university graduates like Jawed are struggling to find work, while violence has continued unabated, except for during a week-long partial truce ahead of the US-Taliban deal.In the deadliest attack to hit Afghanistan in weeks, Islamic State group gunmen shot dead 32 people and wounded dozens of others at a Friday rally in Kabul commemorating a politician from the Hazara ethnic group.The Taliban have also ramped up attacks on Afghan forces and civilians.Heightened securityThe ceremonies will take place under heightened security, with road closures and multiple checkpoints set up in Kabul hours before the two men were due to be sworn in.Dozens of supporters waited at two separate venues inside the grounds of the presidential palace, where both men were expected to hold their ceremonies.Experts say the infighting is likely to cost the government, which is already under pressure after being shut out of the Doha negotiations.According to the agreement signed in Qatar, foreign troops will withdraw from Afghanistan in 14 months, in return for various security commitments from the Taliban and a pledge to hold talks with Kabul.Political analyst Atta Noori said the squabbling would “gravely affect the government’s position in the upcoming intra-Afghan talks”.“Unity is the only way (forward) if they want to win on the negotiating table,” he told AFP.The prolonged political crisis has brought back memories of the angrily contested 2014 election, which also saw Ghani declared the winner.That time, Abdullah’s supporters held violent demonstrations before the US finally intervened to broker an awkward deal between the two rivals, with Ghani as the president and Abdullah as the chief executive.The renewed bickering has added to the frustrations of ordinary Afghans.“They make promises during the campaign but never act on their promises,” Kabul resident Noman Formuli said.“They had promised to bring security, they failed. They promised jobs for the country, they failed,” the 24-year-old told AFP.“We are tired of seeing them”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghanistan-s-duelling-leaders-to-hold-parallel-presidential-inaugurations/story-mExctw6zB1weg6AALfDttJ.html

Carriers are liable for treatment costs if they fly in people who become sick with Covid-19, the notice said.The new framework applies to six territories: China, Hong Kong, Macau, South Korea, Iran and Italy. Thailand has designated them danger zones for infection, as it steps up efforts against Covid-19 after so far restricting the number of confirmed cases to 50.The Tourism Authority of Thailand, a government agency, wrote on Facebook on Monday that travelers coming from the six regions “will undergo 14 days quarantine,” adding more details will be announced shortly.“We advise all travellers to consider carefully whether they still want to pursue their journey,” the authority wrote.The Facebook post follows a series of confusing flip-flops on the matter, which left it unclear whether self-quarantine for those coming from the danger zones is mandatory or only strongly recommended.Read More: Thailand Does the Once Unthinkable by Hindering Chinese TourismA plunge in crude oil prices and escalating fears over the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak sparked a 7% plunge in Thai stocks Monday, the worst drop since 2014.

09-03-2020||World||US virus cases pass 500 as California readies for cruise ship arrival||The number of US coronavirus cases soared past 500 Sunday, including two further deaths, as California braced for the arrival of infected cruise ship passengers and saw a major tennis event canceled.The surge came as President Donald Trump defended his administration’s “perfectly coordinated” response to the epidemic, after heavy criticism over health cuts and strategic blunders that have failed to stem its rapid spread.Some 30 US states have been hit by the novel coronavirus, with Oregon the latest to declare an emergency, and 60 million people in California and New York are under crisis measures.Two more deaths linked to a virus-hit care home near Seattle were reported Sunday, bringing the nationwide toll to at least 21.A Johns Hopkins tally put the number of confirmed US cases at 554 by Sunday evening, with newly diagnosed patients in states including Pennsylvania, Illinois, Massachusetts, Connecticut and New Jersey.Medical officers headed for a virus-hit cruise ship stranded off San Francisco to begin screening passengers for an “unprecedented and difficult” landing operation.The Grand Princess, with 21 confirmed coronavirus infections among 3,500 people on board, is due to dock in nearby Oakland Monday.The operation to move passengers ashore will take two to three days, said Governor Gavin Newsom.Passenger quarantineCarolyn Wright, a passenger on the ship, told AFP that people without symptoms were allowed to leave their cabins for the first time since Thursday.Once ashore, ill passengers will be moved to hospitals, while Americans not requiring treatment will be quarantined at military bases in California, Texas and Georgia for 14 days.Foreign passengers will be repatriated, while crew will remain quarantined on board.The State Department warned vulnerable people including the elderly “should not travel by cruise ship.”Several public events have been canceled across the US in an effort to contain the epidemic.The ATP and WTA tennis tournament in Indian Wells was called off on Sunday just days before it was due to begin.Officials said they opted to cancel after the health department of California’s Riverside County declared a public health emergency for the Coachella Valley -- in the desert east of Los Angeles -- after a confirmed case of COVID-19 locally.The tournament is one of the biggest outside the four Grand Slams and draws more than 400,000 fans each year.‘Flat-footed’Trump has defended his record after accusations he peddled misinformation on the outbreak, blaming the media for trying to make his government “look bad.”“We have a perfectly coordinated and fine tuned plan at the White House for our attack on CoronaVirus,” he tweeted.“We moved VERY early to close borders to certain areas, which was a Godsend. V.P. is doing a great job. The Fake News Media is doing everything possible to make us look bad. Sad!”But Larry Hogan, the Republican governor of Maryland, criticized Trump, telling NBC the president “hasn’t communicated the way I would, and the way I might like him to.”Fellow Republican Ted Cruz, a US senator, revealed he had shaken hands at a conservative conference with a person who later tested positive.“I have decided to remain at my home in Texas this week, until a full 14 days have passed,” he wrote on Facebook, adding he had no symptoms.Trump and Vice President Mike Pence also attended the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) near Washington last month.Trump has been heavily rebuked for repeatedly contradicting the advice of his administration’s experts in his public pronouncements about the coronavirus.He has downplayed the threat posed by the epidemic, which has killed more than 3,500 people since emerging in China, suggesting cases were “going very substantially down, not up.”New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said federal health authorities had been “caught flat-footed” and had “handcuffed” the ability of individual states to respond.“Their messages are all over the place, frankly,” he told Fox News.Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told Fox News that the possibility of following Italy’s example in locking down large sections of the population could not be ruled out.“You don’t want to alarm people but, given the spread we’ve seen, anything is possible,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-virus-cases-pass-500-as-california-readies-for-cruise-ship-arrival/story-Wop7oeCWwcW7Zm5NfpWPRP.html
09-03-2020||World||China reports 22 deaths, closes makeshift hospitals as coronavirus cases drop||China has reported 22 new deaths from the deadly coronavirus, the lowest number of fatalities in more than a month, taking the death toll to 3,119, while the new confirmed cases hit a record low to 40, prompting authorities to close 11 temporary hospitals at the virus epicentre in Wuhan.China’s National Health Commission, (NHC) said on Monday it received reports of 40 new confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, the lowest number of fresh cases since it started reporting the data in January, and 22 deaths on Sunday on the Chinese mainland.The overall confirmed cases on the mainland reached 80,735 by the end of Sunday which included 3,119 people who have died so far, 19,016 patients undergoing treatment and 58,600 patients discharged after recovery, the NHC said.Among the deaths on Sunday, 21 were in Hubei Province and one in Guangdong Province.Meanwhile, 60 new suspected cases were reported taking the total to 421 people, it said.Also on Sunday, four imported cases (people coming from abroad) of novel coronavirus infection were reported on the mainland, all of which were in Gansu Province. By the end of Sunday, 67 imported cases had been reported, the NHC said.By the end of Sunday, 114 confirmed cases, including three deaths have been reported in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), 10 confirmed cases in the Macao SAR, and 45 in Taiwan including one death, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.Meanwhile, China has begun dismantling a host of temporary hospitals built-in big public places like auditoriums and sports complexes in Wuhan set up during the massive surge of virus cases in January and February.China has built two makeshift hospitals with 2,300 beds capacity in just about 10 days’ time in early February and later started converting public buildings into hospitals to meet the rush of patients.Two makeshift hospitals were suspended on Sunday in Wuhan, capital of central China’s Hubei Province and the heart of the novel coronavirus outbreak, as the number of patients continued to drop, local officials said.The city has suspended the operation of 11 makeshift hospitals, which were converted from public facilities for the treatment of patients with mild symptoms in the city, the report said.One of these two hospitals, converted from a sports venue, had 1,000 beds with more than 1,000 medical and other staff. A total of 1,056 patients have been treated here since February 12, with no medical staff infected.Another hospital, covering over 6,100 square meters treated 990 patients with 996 beds since February 17.The medical staff in these hospitals will be on standby.The provincial health commission said earlier that Hubei will gradually shut down temporary hospitals and cut the number of hospitals designated for the disease while maintaining strict prevention and control measures.Hubei province and its capital Wuhan continued to be in lockdown since January 23 with all public and private transport banned. Officials say the restrictions would be gradually eased keeping up with the trend of the COVID-19 slowdown.According to the daily situation report on the COVID-19 released by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on Sunday, seven more countries have seen local transmission of the virus, bringing the number of countries and regions where local transmission emerged to 53 in addition to China. The seven countries are Cambodia, Austria, Hungary, Egypt, Peru, Bulgaria and Maldives.A total of 105,586 confirmed cases of the COVID-19 have been reported worldwide as of Sunday, an increase of 3,656 infections from the previous day, including 3,610 new cases outside China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-reports-22-deaths-closes-makeshift-hospitals-as-coronavirus-cases-drop/story-GAZNHrth3VUIW05lQwDEeO.html

That was the biggest percentage drop since Jan. 17, 1991, at the start of the first Gulf War and the lowest since Feb. 12, 2016. It was trading at $35.75 at 0114 GMT.U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fell by as much as $11.28, or 27.4%, to $30 a barrel. That was also the biggest percentage drop since the first Gulf War in January 1991 and the lowest since Feb. 22, 2016. It was trading at $32.61.Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest oil exporter, is attempting to punish Russia, the world’s second-largest producer, for balking on Friday at production cuts proposed by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).OPEC and other producers supported the cuts to stabilize falling prices caused by the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak.Saudi Arabia plans to boost crude output above 10 million barrels per day (bpd) in April after the current supply deal between OPEC and Russia, - known as OPEC+ - expires at the end of March, two sources told Reuters on Sunday.Saudi Arabia, Russia, and other major producers last battled for market share like this between 2014 and 2016 to try to squeeze out production from the United States, now the world’s biggest oil producer as flows from shale oil fields doubled the country’s output during the last decade.“Saudi Arabia and Russia are entering into an oil price war that is likely to be limited and tactical,” Eurasia Group said in a note.“The most likely outcome of this crisis is entrenchment into a painful process that lasts several weeks or months, until prices are low enough to ... some form of compromise on resumed OPEC+ production restraint,” Eurasia said.Saudi Arabia has opened the war by cutting its official selling prices for April for all crude grades to all destinations by between $6 to $8 a barrel.China’s efforts to curtail the coronavirus outbreak has disrupted the world’s second-largest economy and curtailed shipments to the largest oil importer.The spread to other major economies such as Italy and South Korea and the burgeoning cases in the United States has increased the concerns that oil demand will slump this year.Major banks such as Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have cut their demand growth forecasts, with Morgan Stanley predicting China will have zero demand growth in 2020 while Goldman is seeing a contraction of global demand of 150,000 barrels per day.In other markets, the dollar was down sharply against the yen, Asian stock markets were set for big falls and gold rose to the highest since 2013 as investors fled to safe havens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/crude-oil-plunges-30-biggest-drop-since-1991-after-saudi-slashes-prices/story-aqpNDTIXU2fyMfHhjR6axN.html
09-03-2020||World||Coronavirus outbreak: Empty streets and paranoia as northern Italy goes into lockdown||The sun shone on deserted squares in Milan and empty gondolas in Venice on Sunday as a quarter of Italy’s population came to grips with being cut off from the rest of the country, under new rules strictly limiting movement in and out of the new red zone.While some packed their bags and fled, most in northern Italy stayed to brave a lockdown imposed by the government on some 15 million people, as it ramps up the fight against the deadly coronavirus.The country on Sunday recorded the second-highest coronavirus toll in the world, after reporting a sharp jump in deaths -- from 133 to 366 -- and overtaking South Korea on infections.Italy’s interior ministry said anyone flouting the lockdown risked at least three months in jail or a 206 euro (USD 233) fine.Only people with a “serious” reason that cannot be postponed, such as urgent work or family issues, will be allowed in or out of the quarantine zones, which cover Lombardy and 14 provinces in four other regions.Passengers departing on flights in the lockdown areas will need to justify themselves -- apart from people who had been in the area temporarily, who are allowed to return home. All arrivals will need to justify their travel.Police will be setting up controls at train stations to check people’s temperatures, and stopping all cars on main roads in and out to verify the reason for travel, the ministry said in a statement.Cruise ships will be forbidden from docking in Venice, with only passengers who are residents of the Renaissance city allowed to disembark.Alitalia suspended national and international flights to and from Milan Malpensa airport, and announced it was operating only domestic routes from Milan Linate.The borders with Austria, Switzerland and Slovenia remain open.Pina Antinucci, a psychoanalyst in her 60s who lives in Milan, told AFP she was suffering nightmares and felt the state was “bombarding us with anxieties, spreading paranoia”.“I’d like to know if I’m infected... it would be better to know if I have that unwanted guest who occupies our homes, minds and lives,” she said.With 366 fatalities, Italy has recorded the most deaths from the COVID-19 disease of any country outside China, where the outbreak began in December.The new rules came shortly after the news that the number of people infected had jumped by over 1,200 in a 24-hour period.The plan was leaked to the media on Saturday, infuriating Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, who slammed it as “unacceptable”, saying it had created “uncertainty, anxiety, (and) confusion”.Expert Massimo Galli, the head of a team of doctors from the Biomedical Research Institute in Milan who managed to identify the Italian strain last month, told AFP it had been a “disastrous communication error” and “absolute idiocracy”.Italian virologist Roberto Burioni described the leak on Twitter as “pure madness”.“The draft of a very harsh decree is leaked, sparking panic and prompting people to try and flee the (then) theoretical red zone, carrying the virus with them,” he said on social media.Vincenzo Tosetti, a 34-year old actor and Venice resident, told AFP “many people I know have fled, mainly from Milan.“This is going to test the Italians’ ability to behave responsibly, and I have to say that up until now they’ve been failing. There’s been an exodus”.Fellow Venetian Giancarlo, 49, who did not want to give his last name, said “you can feel the anxiety in the air”.The floating city was also virtually empty of tourists, which was “a big blow”.“First the city was hit by record floods, now this. Venice is very fragile right now,” he said.Italy has found itself at the forefront of the global fight against the virus, with more than 5,800 infections recorded in the past seven weeks.The virus has now spread to all 22 Italian regions, and the first deaths are being recorded in Italy’s less well medically equipped south.The head of the Puglia region in southern Italy pleaded with anyone thinking of returning from Lombardy and the other 11 provinces in lockdown -- which include the cities of Parma and Rimini -- to “stop and turn around”.“Get off (the train) at the first station, don’t get on the flights to Bari and Brindisi, turn your cars around, get off the bus at the next stop. Don’t bring the epidemic to Puglia,” he said on Facebook.“You are carrying to the lungs of your brothers and sisters, grandparents, uncles, cousins and parents the virus that has severely strained the health system in northern Italy,” he said.

09-03-2020||World||Might broaden entry restrictions over coronavirus fears: Israel PM Netanyahu||Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday Israel might broaden its entry restrictions over coronavirus fears to include visitors from all countries.Israel already requires travellers arriving from more than a dozen countries and territories in Europe and Asia to go into home quarantine for 14 days. The measure has effectively cut off tourism from those countries and led some foreign airlines to suspend flights to Israel.The number of coronavirus cases in Israel rose to 39 from 25 on Sunday, with no deaths so far, the Health Ministry said. Some 80,000 Israelis are in self-quarantine after returning from travel abroad.Netanyahu spoke by telephone on Sunday with U.S. Vice-President Mike Pence to discuss coronavirus concerns amid Israeli media reports that Israel was considering barring visitors from parts of the United States where the illness has spread.Israeli political commentators have said Netanyahu, fearful of drawing criticism from a main ally, U.S. President Donald Trump, has resisted pressure by Israeli public health officials to add New York, the state of Washington and California to the restricted list.At a news conference, Netanyahu said Israel was “weighing quarantine for everyone” flying into the country.“We have reached the decision that if we take additional steps, it will apply to all countries,” he said. “But on the other hand, it is very difficult decision.”He said a decision would be made on Monday in consultation with Israeli health authorities and emergency authorities.Netanyahu and Pence agreed to follow up their telephone call with discussions between U.S. and Israeli health officials on technological and scientific cooperation and ways to tackle the virus, Netanyahu’s office said in a statement.Israel has already ordered travellers from Italy, Germany, France, Spain, Andorra, San Marino, Austria, Switzerland, China, Macau, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, South Korea and Thailand to go into home quarantine.

09-03-2020||World||California prepares to dock cruise ship with 21 coronavirus cases||As the U.S. death toll from the new coronavirus reached at least 21, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and the mayor of Oakland sought Sunday to reassure the public that none of the passengers from a ship carrying people with the virus will be released into the public before undergoing a 14-day quarantine.The Grand Princess carrying more than 3,500 people from 54 countries is expected to dock Monday in Oakland, in the east San Francisco Bay, and was idling off the coast Sunday as officials prepared a port site. Those needing acute medical care will come off first.“This is a time that we must be guided by facts and not fears, and our public deserves to know what’s going on,” Mayor Libby Schaaf said.Meanwhile, the number of infections in the United States climbed above 500 as testing for the virus increased.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the National Institutes of Health’s allergy and infectious diseases chief, said Sunday that widespread closure of a city or region, as Italy has done, is “possible.”“You don’t want to alarm people, but given the spread we see, you know anything is possible and that’s the reason why we’ve got to be prepared to take whatever action is appropriate to contain and mitigate the outbreak,” Fauci said on “Fox News Sunday.”U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams said communities will need to start thinking about canceling large gatherings, closing schools and letting more employees work from home, as many companies have done in the Seattle, Washington, area amid an outbreak at a care home that has killed 17.Oregon Gov. Kate Brown declared a state of emergency Sunday after the number of confirmed cases there doubled from the previous day to 14.On the Grand Princess, Donna LaGesse and her sister-in-law Jackie Eilers had a small celebration in their cabin Saturday night after the captain announced the ship would soon dock. She said they’re maintaining a positive attitude, watching exercise videos and re-runs of “The Love Boat.”“We’re keeping our senses of humor. We’re laughing at the whole situation,” said LaGesse, 64, of Greenville, North Carolina. “We’re lucky because we have a room with a balcony so we can get some fresh air.”The Oakland port was chosen for the ship to dock because of its proximity to an airport and a military base, Newsom said. U.S. passengers will be transported to military bases in California, Texas and Georgia, where they will be tested for COVID-19 and remain under a 14-day quarantine, federal officials said.The 1,113-member crew will be quarantined and treated aboard the ship, which will dock elsewhere, Newsom said.“That ship will turn around — and they are currently assessing appropriate places to bring that quarantined ship — but it will not be here in the San Francisco Bay,” he said.The Department of State was working with the home countries of several hundred passengers to arrange their repatriation.Canada announced it was sending a plane to collect nearly 240 Canadians on the Grand Princess. Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said those who have not shown any symptoms of the new virus will be taken to a military base in Trenton, Ontario, for a two-week quarantine.The Grand Princess had been forbidden to dock in San Francisco amid evidence the vessel was the breeding ground for a cluster of at least 20 cases, including one death, after a previous voyage. It was held off the coast Wednesday so people with symptoms could be tested.Grant Tarling, chief medical officer for Carnival Corporation, said it’s believed a 71-year-old Northern California man who later died of the virus was probably sick when he boarded the ship for a Feb. 11 cruise to Mexico.The passenger visited the medical center the day before disembarking with symptoms of respiratory illness, he said. He likely infected his dining room server, who also tested positive for the virus, Tarling said, as did two people traveling with the man.Off the coast of Florida Sunday, another ship was being held off the coast awaiting test results on whether two crew members who transferred from the Grand Princess have contracted the new virus. The Coast Guard delivered testing kits Sunday to the Regal Princess. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a “no-sail order” for the ship.Another Princess ship, the Diamond Princess, was quarantined for two weeks in Yokohama, Japan, last month because of the virus. Ultimately, about 700 of the 3,700 people aboard became infected in what experts pronounced a public-health failure, with the vessel essentially becoming a floating germ factory.Hundreds of Americans aboard that ship were flown to military bases in California and other states for two-week quarantines. Some later were hospitalized with symptoms.Private companies and some public venues in the U.S. have been taking safety measures in an effort to limit the virus’ spread. The largest school district in Northern California canceled classes for a week when it was discovered a family in the district was exposed to COVID-19. Elk Grove Unified has nearly 64,000 students.Kendyl Knight learned Saturday that her prom was off while she was in a salon chair getting her makeup done.“You can’t really be mad about it, but it is very disappointing,” said the 16-year-old, who went out for dinner and got photos taken with her friends anyway. She said she “may be young and naive,” but she is not concerned about the new virus.“Honestly the decision to cancel school seems kind of extreme,” Knight said.On the campaign trail, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders said he would consider when it may become necessary to cancel large campaign rallies. President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden had no plans to curtail theirs.“In the best of all possible worlds” the three candidates should probably limit travel and avoid crowds, Sanders told CNN, “but right now, we’re running as hard as we can.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-prepares-to-dock-cruise-ship-with-21-coronavirus-cases/story-571I3LIYFvtkm7v5rhHa9O.html
09-03-2020||World||Saudi seals off Shiite region, halts travel over coronavirus||Saudi Arabia on Sunday cordoned off an oil-rich Shiite stronghold, suspended air and sea travel to nine countries and closed schools and universities, in a series of measures to contain the fast-spreading coronavirus.The lockdown on Qatif, an eastern area that is home to around 500,000 people, is the first action of its kind across the Gulf region, which has confirmed more than 230 coronavirus cases -- most of them people returning from religious pilgrimages to Shiite-majority Iran.Given the kingdom’s 11 recorded cases of the new coronavirus are from Qatif, “it has been decided to temporarily suspend entry and exit” from the area, the interior ministry said in a statement carried by the official Saudi Press Agency (SPA).Except for essential services such as pharmacies and gas stations, work will stop in all government and private institutions in Qatif, the statement added.Although the ministry said the lockdown was temporary, it risks fuelling resentment in the flashpoint region whose residents have long accused the Sunni-dominated government of discrimination, a charge Riyadh denies.The government also decided to temporarily suspend “the travel of citizens and residents to the UAE, Kuwait, Bahrain, Lebanon, Syria, South Korea, Egypt, Italy and Iraq, as well as suspend the entry of those coming from those countries,” SPA reported.“The kingdom also decided to stop air and sea travel between the kingdom and the mentioned countries,” it added.The decision is expected to leave expat workers from those countries as well as Saudi travellers stranded.Saudi Arabia also announced it was closing all public and private universities and schools across the country from Monday until further notice, SPA reported.- Pilgrimage suspended -Saudi Arabia has blamed arch-rival Iran for its spike in coronavirus cases, while condemning Tehran for allowing its citizens entry without stamping their passports.The Saudi government has reminded its nationals of a standing ban on travel to Iran, as the two countries are locked in a battle for regional supremacy.Iran is home to key shrines and pilgrimage sites for Shiites, who make up between 10 and 15 percent of Saudi Arabia’s population of 32 million.The kingdom has also suspended the “umrah” year-round pilgrimage over fears of the disease spreading to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina in the west.The unprecedented suspension of the umrah has raised uncertainty over the annual hajj pilgrimage, scheduled for the end of July.The pilgrimages, a major source of revenue, could also be a source of contagion and the move mirrors a precautionary approach across the Gulf to cancel mass gatherings -- from concerts to sporting events.Bahrain’s Formula 1 Grand Prix scheduled for March 20-22 will be held without spectators, the organisers said Sunday, the latest sporting event to be affected by measures to contain the disease.Saudi Arabia is also grappling with a coronavirus-led slump in oil prices just as it seeks to raise funds to finance Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s ambitious economic transformation plan.bur-ac/kaf||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-seals-off-shiite-region-halts-travel-over-coronavirus/story-PuNyBGkcihbE8Dnx6R51nN.html
09-03-2020||World||North Korea fires three unidentified projectiles off its east coast: Report||North Korea has fired three projectiles, Seoul’s military said Monday, a week after it launched what the South said appeared to be two short-range ballistic missiles.Three devices were fired eastwards over the sea from the Sondok area in South Hamgyong province, the South’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement.“The military is monitoring for additional launches and maintaining readiness,” it added.Monday’s launch was the North’s second weapons test in a week.After last week’s launch the North’s state media said leader Kim Jong Un had overseen a “long-range artillery” drill but it was not clear if those two incidents last week were the same.The latest launch came days after Kim sent a personal letter to the South’s President Moon Jae-in, offering “comfort” for the rapid outbreak of the new coronavirus outbreak in the country.That message had followed an unprecedented statement by Kim’s younger sister Yo Jong, when she said Seoul’s condemnation of Pyongyang’s weapons test last week was a “truly senseless act” and “perfectly foolish”.The North carried out a series of weapons tests late last year, the last of them in November, which it often described as multiple launch rocket systems although others called them ballistic missiles.It also carried out static engine tests, most recently in December.At a party meeting at the end of that month, Kim declared that Pyongyang no longer considered itself bound by its moratoriums on nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests, and threatened a demonstration of a “new strategic weapon” soon.The launches come as nuclear negotiations with the US are at a standstill and after the expiry of a unilateral deadline Pyongyang set for Washington to offer it fresh concessions on sanctions relief.The one-year anniversary of the collapsed Hanoi summit between Kim and US President Donald Trump also passed, earlier this year.Pyongyang is under multiple sets of sanctions over its weapons programmes from the United Nations Security Council, US, South Korea and others.Heightened tensions in 2017 were followed by two years of nuclear diplomacy between Pyongyang and Washington, including three meetings between Kim and Trump, but little tangible progress was made.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-fires-3-projectiles-report/story-wPggqRo4BbP1qB490YV3UL.html

09-03-2020||World||Coronavirus lockdown in Italy cuts off over 15 million in northern region||Over 15 million people across a vast swathe of northern Italy woke on Sunday to find themselves cut off from the rest of the country, after the government imposed a virtual lockdown to prevent the coronavirus spreading.Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte signed off on plans that strictly limit movement in and out of the north, including Venice and the financial capital Milan, for nearly a month.“The virus closes the heart of the north,” the Stampa daily’s headline read, while Il Messaggero went with “Half of Italy shuts”.It was not clear however how strictly the order would be enforced, or how authorities could prevent people from leaving.The decree said that only people with a “serious” reason that cannot be postponed, such as urgent work or family issues, would be allowed in or out of the quarantine zones, which affect a quarter of Italy’s population of 60 million.But it does allow for the return home of those who were in the affected areas but live elsewhere, including tourists.Flights appeared to be operating normally out of Milan and Venice airports, while it was business as usual at train stations.Streets in Milan were largely deserted.With more than 230 fatalities, Italy has recorded the most deaths from the COVID-19 disease of any country outside China, where the outbreak began in December.The new rules came shortly after the news the number of people infected had jumped by over 1,200 in a 24-hour period.‘Uncertainty, anxiety, confusion’The plan was leaked to the media Saturday, infuriating Conte, who slammed it as “unacceptable”, saying it had created “uncertainty, anxiety, (and) confusion”.Italian virologist Roberto Burioni described the leak Sunday on Twitter as “pure madness”.“The draft of a very harsh decree is leaked, sparking panic and prompting people to try and flee the (then) theoretical red zone, carrying the virus with them,” he said on social media.“In the end, the only effect is to help the virus to spread. I’m lost for words”.The virus has now spread to all 22 Italian regions and the first deaths are being recorded in Italy’s less well medically equipped south.‘Turn around’ The head of the Puglia region in southern Italy pleaded with anyone thinking of returning from Lombardy and the other 11 provinces in lockdown -- which include the cities of Parma and Rimini -- to “stop and turn around”.“I’m speaking to you as if you were my children, my brothers, my grandchildren,” he said on Facebook.“Get off (the train) at the first station, don’t get on the flights to Bari and Brindisi, turn your cars around, get off the bus at the next stop. Don’t bring the epidemic to Puglia.“You are carrying to the lungs of your brothers and sisters, grandparents, uncles, cousins, and parents, the virus that has severely strained the health system in northern Italy,” he said.Anyone making the journey anyway would be placed in obligatory quarantine for 14 days, he said.Italy has found itself at the forefront of the global fight against the virus, with more than 5,800 infections recorded in the past seven weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coroanvirus-lockdown-in-italy-cuts-off-over-15-million-in-northern-region/story-MdwzCER5AKFNmFknHLyQtK.html
