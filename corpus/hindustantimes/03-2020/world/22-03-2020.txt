They were tested after a member of the vice-president’s staff had texted positive.More than 325 people have died and 25,000 have been infected in the outbreak that has spread to all parts of the country, with New York, California and Washington states hit the hardest; New York City has emerged as the “epicenter” of the outbreak.New York and California, which have issued stay-at-home orders for all but essential services and workers, on Saturday issued orders restricting testing only to health workers and the severely ill to preserve medical supplies essential to combating the outbreak, including testing kits and protective gear.“Not every single person in the U.S. needs to get tested,” said Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, at a White House briefing Saturday. “When you go in and get tested, you are consuming personal protective equipment, masks and gowns — those are high priority for the health care workers who are taking care of people who have coronavirus disease.”There are concerns about depleting medical supplies considered essential to combating the outbreak, such as testing kits, marks, hospital beds, respirators and ventilators. President Donald Trump has involved war-time powers under the Defense Production Act to direct private sector companies to ramp up manufacturing of needed supplies, but has not used it yet.A shortage of testing kits has been a big concern and regulators have approved a rash of new tests in recent weeks. The lack of enough diagnostic kits has been exacerbated by the time it takes to determine a person is infected or not. There have been been cases, reported on social media, of a person dying in the intervening period. A diagnostic kit approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Saturday will cut the waiting time dramatically. Manufactured by Cepheid, a California-based company, the test has a turnaround times of 45 minutes, the Washington Post reported, instead of the days its takes for current tests, that involve sending samples to centralized labs.David Persing, Cepheid’s chief medical and technology officer, told the Post the test is not meant for the “worried well” but to help doctors quickly determine whether or not a patient is infected and prescribe appropriate treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-states-restrict-testing-regulator-approves-rapid-result-diagnostic-kit/story-O4wYYa9zBwc8tsImjbsNCN.html
22-03-2020||World||UK assures stranded Indians on visa status||The Boris Johnson government on Sunday assured Indian citizens whose visas may be ending and are stranded due to the lack of flights to India that no one will be “unfairly penalised” for events related to the coronavirus pandemic.The assurance was conveyed to the Indian high commission in the context of anxiety and worse among many Indians who are unable to return after New Delhi stopped incoming flights as well as citizens from the UK and the European Union from entering the country.The Foreign Office said: “The Home Office is working urgently on guidance for Indians and those of other nationalities in the UK whose visas are due to expire but are currently unable to leave due to the impacts of COVID-19”.“While that work is ongoing, foreign nationals in the UK do not need to be concerned about their immigration status: no one will be unfairly penalised for events beyond their control as a result of COVID-19”, it added.Some Indian students keen to return home demonstrated in the high commission over the weekend. They were told of the travel ban and inability of the mission to arrange flights until the ban is in place, while officials arranged food and stay for many in the group.Indian high commissioner Ruchi Ghanashyam said: “I appeal to all Indian citizens to stay calm and follow the advisory issued by the National Health Service…At the moment, flights to India stand temporarily suspended till 31st March”.“We will keep you all updated about the resumption of flights…These are trying times…The High Commission has been getting encouraging response from individuals and organisations who are coming forward to help stranded Indians”, she said.Student visas are tied to teaching and universities are obliged to report any absences by visa holders to the Home Office, but it recognised that Indian and other international students and professionals with work visas may be prevented from attending their studies or employment due to illness.“The Home Office recognises the current situation is exceptional and will not take any compliance action against students or employees who are unable to attend their studies/work due to the coronavirus outbreak, or against sponsors which authorise absences and continue to sponsor students or employees despite absences for this reason”, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-assures-stranded-indians-on-visa-status/story-WLBqpC9En16aLmZ5Id6BAN.html
22-03-2020||World||UK 2 or 3 weeks behind Italy-like spike, says PM Boris Johnson||Prime Minister of UK Boris Johnson said on Sunday that the number of deaths and cases are climbing in the country, and added that “We cannot disguise or sugar-coat the threat” of coronavirus. The situation in the UK is, according to him, like Italy’s was two or three weeks ago.Latest figures show that 233 people have died and 5,018 cases were confirmed positive, as concern grew over people in many parts of the UK going out to enjoy Sunday’s sunny weather instead of socially distancing themselves.Johnson said in a Mother’s Day message that the ‘single best present’ people could give their mothers is to stay away and spare them the risk of catching a ‘very dangerous disease’, adding that statistics show that mothers are much more likely to die of coronavirus.He said: “We cannot disguise or sugar-coat the threat. The numbers are very stark, and they are accelerating. We are only a matter of weeks – two or three – behind Italy. The Italians have a superb health care system”.“And yet their doctors and nurses have been completely overwhelmed by the demand. The Italian death toll is already in the thousands and climbing. Unless we act together, unless we make the heroic and collective national effort to slow the spread – then it is all too likely that our own NHS will be similarly overwhelmed”.The Johnson government has closed public places such as pubs, restaurants and theatres, and announced a historic multi-billion-pound package to shore up the economy hit by the crisis, including paying 80 per cent of wages of private sector employees who have or will be laid off.London and others towns are in lockdown, with local authorities moving homeless people on the streets into hotel rooms requisitioned on an emergency basis. Thousands of military personnel are on stand-by as the health service strains to deal with the virus challenge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-2-or-3-weeks-behind-italy-like-spike-says-pm-boris-johnson/story-WPlxoUde6A8ozlk7TNqn0N.html

The Punjab province has 137 cases of Covid-19, Balochistan 103, Gilgit-Baltistan 56 and Khyber Pakhtukhwa 10.Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah urged people in Karachi on Saturday to self-isolate voluntarily for three days. The province has been under partial lockdown.The Pakistan government had recently said that number of Covid-19 positive cases can see a spurt as more than 5,000 pilgrims who recently returned from Iran have spread all over the country.These pilgrims were held at Pakistan’s Taftan border crossing (in Balochistan) with Iran, one of the countries worst affected worldwide by the virus, but due to negligence of officials in enforcing quarantine, the number of cases spiked.As a result of the rapid increase, the government on Saturday suspended all international flight operations for two weeks. The ban will remain in effect till April 4, according to an official statement.“From 8 pm tonight, all incoming international flights are being suspended for two weeks,” said a government statement. National carrier PIA, however, will be allowed to bring back its planes. Cargo flights will also be allowed.Railway Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmad ordered reduction in number of trains running in the country from March 25. “We have decided to suspend 34 trains out of total 142 running in the country while another eight trains will be suspended from April 1,” he said.Overall, 1.4 million people have been screened so far at entry points since the start of the outbreak, media reports said.The reports further said that Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi asked his German counterpart Heiko Maas for relief in the form of repayment of loans so that the country can focus on dealing with the Covid-19 outbreak.He told his German counterpart on phone that united efforts were needed for dealing with the pandemic that has emerged as a major challenge for the entire world, said media reports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-can-face-complete-lockdown-say-reports-as-covid-19-cases-spread-rapidly/story-WHNNfUqdiLK4Z5LeFJgUwN.html
22-03-2020||World||Germany sets example with aggressive testing||In the past week, Germany has overtaken several nations to find itself on number four on the list of countries in terms of total Covid-19 infections, but it has managed to keep its fatality rate relatively low. Scientists attribute the disparity between the number of confirmed cases and death rate to a handful of factors, primarily Germany’s aggressive testing strategy.With only 67 deaths from nearly 20,000 cases as of March 20, Germany is far better placed than Italy, which has reported 4,032 deaths and over 47,000 cases despite the two countries sharing a similar demography and reporting their first cases in the same week. This means that while Italy has more than twice Germany’s case load, its death toll is nearly 60 times worse.“Test, test, test” has become the best recommendation for tackling the virus, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). In this aspect, Germany has not faltered. Lothar Wieler, president of Germany’s disease control and prevention agency, the Robert Koch Institute, said that German labs were performing 160,000 tests every week.With an estimated 280,000 tests as of March 20, Germany has conducted more tests than several other European countries combined. For context, Italy, has conducted 26% fewer tests. Also Watch how Italians & Parisians are turning to music amid coronavirus lockdownMass testing helps Germany monitor the fatality rate as it allows officials to detect cases that show no symptoms, and thus have a much better chance of survival if cases are detected in nascent stages, scientists sayAnother key factor is the age of the patients infected in Germany. According to official data, the majority of confirmed patients in Germany are under the age of 60 – over 80% – which also explains the low death rate. In Germany, the median age for Covid-19 patient is 47 years, while in Italy, it is 63 years. In fact, more than 70% of patients in Italy are above the age of 50, according to government statistics.However, the German government struck a note of caution as many of the cases remained in the early stages of the coronavirus. “We are at the beginning of an epidemic… Over 1,000 people have already survived the virus. But many will also get seriously ill. And we have to be able to provide them with medical care,” Wieler told local news outlets last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-sets-example-with-aggressive-testing/story-GZ5zqROPBADIUIMfPSJhJI.html
