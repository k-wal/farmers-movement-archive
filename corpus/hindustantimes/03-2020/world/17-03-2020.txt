It’s still an enormous number of deaths and an enormous pressure on the health service.”In new developments:- Britons were told only to travel abroad if absolutely necessary for the next 30 days, to avoid being stranded by border closures, flight cancellations and strict curfews.- the National Health Service in England said all non-urgent operations would be postponed from April 15 for at least three months, in a move designed to free up 30,000 beds.- Queen Elizabeth II moved to her Windsor Castle residence west of London a week early, and said several large public events, including royal garden parties, will be postponed or cancelled.- the Church of England’s most senior cleric, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, said public worship was “suspended until further notice”, but weddings and funerals can still be held.The moves came as tougher emergency restrictions on social contacts are expected to be introduced, including forcing people with serious health conditions to stay at home for three months.Prime Minister Boris Johnson has faced criticism for his approach to the pandemic, which had involved holding off on imposing the strict measures seen in other countries.But he stepped up the response on Monday after scientists warned hundreds of thousands could die in Britain if there was only a focus on delaying and slowing infections.- ‘Intensive intervention’ -Thirty members of Imperial College London’s COVID-19 response team concluded in a paper that suppression was “the preferred policy option” to curb the spread of the virus.It would require “a combination of social distancing of the entire population, home isolation of cases and household quarantine of their family members”.“This type of intensive intervention package... will need to be maintained until a vaccine becomes available (potentially 18 months or more),” the report stated.They predicted transmission would “quickly rebound if interventions are relaxed”, it added.The study’s lead author, epidemiologist Neil Ferguson, is advising the British government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, which is helping coordinate its COVID-19 response.He said he had also shared the projections with US President Donald Trump’s administration last week and sent it an early copy of the report over the weekend.Ferguson said the government had “no other option” but to implement new measures because modelling from new Italian data indicated 81 percent of Britons and Americans would be infected.Some 510,000 would die in the UK and 2.2 million in the US, peaking after three months. Mitigation policies would only halve that number and healthcare systems would still be overloaded.The sobering assessment saw London and Washington both announce stringent new social distancing measures on Monday.- ‘Crippling blow’ - The latest measures sparked concern about the impact on business, especially in the hospitality industry, amid fears of an extensive economic fall-out from the outbreak. Fashion chain Laura Ashley filed for administration, putting up to 2,700 jobs at risk, and car giant Nissan announced a halt in production at its Sunderland factory because of falling demand.Meanwhile, the British Beer and Pub Association warned thousands of jobs would be lost if pubs went to the wall without government intervention.Arts groups said they faced a “crippling blow” if audiences stayed away. The Tate museums and galleries announced their closure until May 1.All events in London’s Trafalgar Square, including upcoming celebrations for St George’s Day, Vaisakhi and Eid, were cancelled until further notice, Mayor Sadiq Khan said. Controversially, schools remain open.But the government, which has promised a £30-billion ($36-billion) package of support for affected individuals and businesses, maintains it is guided by the latest science.jj-ar-phz/dmh/spmFERGUSONNISSAN MOTOR||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-begins-tougher-virus-action-after-dire-science-warning/story-kFnVPdG5zQYjsQOljgPkSO.html
17-03-2020||World||Coronavirus: London records rapid transmission; life on hold amid scam alert||This usually bustling metropolis presented a deserted look across most locations on Tuesday as people stayed at home following new advice from Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who said coronavirus was transmitting more rapidly in London than in the rest of the UK.Oxford Street, Piccadilly, Trafalgar Square, the Strand and major commuter hubs such as the Waterloo station recorded a fraction of the usual buzz and traffic. Tube and train travel was registered considerably low traffic.According to Johnson, London is “weeks ahead” of other UK regions in terms of the virus curve. He asked residents to pay special attention to the advice to work from home and to avoid unnecessary social contact. Scotland Yard cautioned self-isolating people about trusting ‘kind’ strangers who may offer to run errands, but may lead to scams if credit card and other numbers are handed over. The Church of England put public worship on hold.There are nearly 500 confirmed cases in London and at least 14 have died, according to latest figures. Following official advice, pubs, theatres and restaurants have either closed or cut services to few customers, affecting a large number of temporary jobs in the sector.Johnson said: “The very draconian measures outlined will be asking a lot from the everyone. What we’re doing is giving very strong advice that public venues such as theatres should no longer be visited”.“It’s important that Londoners now pay special attention to what we’re saying about non-essential contact and to take particularly seriously the advice about working from home and avoiding confined spaces such as pubs and restaurants,” he added.London mayor Sadiq Khan confirmed that all events in Trafalgar Square will be cancelled until further notice, including the St George’s Day festival on April 18, Vaisakhi on April 25 and Eid on May 30.He said: “It is vital that we take all necessary precautions to ensure the health of all in our city. Our Trafalgar Square celebrations are key moments that bring communities together from across the capital, but the Government has advised that large gatherings should not take place so we will be cancelling them until further notice”.“This is a challenging time for everyone but I want to reassure Londoners that we will continue to follow the advice of the medical experts and take the steps that are required to suppress this virus.”Alerting people to opportunists and criminals taking advantage of the elderly and vulnerable in self-isolation, Scotland Yard said anyone being offered ‘kindness’ by cold callers by way of running errands, collecting prescriptions and doing shopping should not accept such services from strangers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-london-records-rapid-transmission-life-on-hold-amid-scam-alert/story-UfgTWMVUJL9ameDh4A039H.html

17-03-2020||World||WHO confirms two coronavirus cases among its staff||An official from the World Health Organization, the body leading the global fight against the coronavirus pandemic, said on Tuesday that two staff members have been confirmed to be infected with coronavirus.The cases are the first at the Geneva-based organisation and follow a confirmed case at the U.N. office in Geneva as well one at the World Trade Organization last week. “The staff had left the office and then at home showed symptoms and were tested and confirmed with COVID-19,” WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier told journalists, referring to the official name of the disease caused by the virus. “We do therefore have two confirmed cases.”It was not clear if the infected staff were working in the coronavirus response.The WHO headquarters is the workplace for about 2,400 staff and consultants and most are now working from home to reduce possible transmission, Lindmeier said.Switzerland has reported a surge in cases in recent days with over 2,200 cases and passed measures including the mobilisation of 8,000 members of the military late on Monday in an effort to control the outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-confirms-two-coronavirus-cases-among-its-staff/story-UacwJ88NyrbnlhlrTTeS7L.html
17-03-2020||World||In Berlin, sex workers face ruin amid virus fears, brothel closures||It’s 7 p.m. on a Friday night, a time when Aurel Johannes Marx’s three-room brothel on the edge of Berlin would normally be preparing for its first customers. Sex for sale has long been a staple part of the German capital’s freewheeling nightlife. But amid concerns over the new coronavirus, even the world’s supposedly oldest profession is suffering a sudden slump.At the “Lankwitzer 7” brothel, with its soft red light and bawdy paintings on the wall, disinfectant dispensers have been installed next to the washbasins. Marx say he’s ordered staff to hot-wash all towels and sheets, and open the windows more often to let the warm, sticky air escape.Still, customers just aren’t coming round anymore.“Over the past week business has gone down by 50%,” Marx said, blaming the decline on the general drop in nightlife that’s occurred since the virus arrived in Berlin.The city has registered 332 confirmed cases of COVID-19 so far. Several dozens infections have been traced to bars and clubs.Susanne Bleier Wilp, a German former sex worker and spokeswoman for the Association of Erotic and Sexual Services Providers, or BESD, said the virus has caused fear and uncertainty among the estimated 100,000 to 200,000 sex workers in Germany, where prostitution was largely legalized almost 20 years ago.“There are those who are withdrawing from the business entirely at the moment for safety reasons,” Bleier Wilp told The Associated Press. Others are requiring that customers disinfect themselves, she added — a measure that medical experts say is unlikely to effectively stop the spread of the virus during close physical contact.For most people the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. But for some, especially older adults and those with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.The vast majority of those who are infected recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover.One worry is that many sex workers are young and may not be too concerned about infection, while some clients are over 50, putting them at greater risk of complications. Reconstructing chains of infection — as authorities are trying to do when a case is confirmed — could also be tricky. “In the business it’s normal to interact anonymously and to use aliases,” said Bleier Wilp. “It’s a problem.”Another problem is that prostitution is financially precarious. Unlike regular employees, most sex workers won’t benefit directly from the half-trillion-euro package of loans the German government is making available to companies facing ruin because of the coronavirus outbreak.“Sex workers are usually self-employed, not employees,” said Bleier Wilp. “That means, they bear all the risks themselves”Some sex workers may be able to rely on savings for several weeks, she said. “But it becomes more difficult if the crisis lasts for longer. Then many, particularly those who do it full time, may have to seek help.”Bleier Wilp said a provision in Germany’s infectious disease protection law might allow self-employed sex workers to apply for compensation due to loss of earnings. The clause has never been tested before, however, and those who have worked on the legal fringes may be disinclined to seek official help: by some estimates, more than two-thirds of sex workers aren’t registered.By Saturday, authorities in Berlin had ordered the temporary closure of all entertainment venues, including brothels. Whether all sex workers will heed that order, or risk their and their client’s health to make ends meet, was unclear.In the Netherlands, Amsterdam’s famed Red Light District was similarly hard hit after the government on Sunday night ordered the closure of schools, bars and restaurants for three weeks and made a point of mentioning that sex clubs also were affected.By Sunday night, the normally packed canal-side streets and narrow, cobbled alleys that are normally a tourist magnet were largely deserted. On Monday, the windows where scantily clad sex workers pose to attract customers were largely empty. Some had signs taped to the glass saying: “The office is closed” due to the coronavirus restrictions.Greece’s closures also affected brothels, while in Poland, where brothels are officially illegal, “massage” parlors were affected by the shutdown. Geneva, where the U.N.’s European headquarters is located, closed all non-essential stores and services as of Monday evening, including barbers and “prostitution activities.”Before the closure, Berlin brothel owner Marx acknowledged that the women working at his establishment were hurting financially.“Everybody wants more money, not less. But that’s the situation at the moment, it’s developing rapidly,” he said. “I can’t do anything to change that.“At some point it will be over, and when it’s over things will work out again,” he added.___Mike Corder and Peter Dejong in Amsterdam, Elena Becatoros in Athens, Jamey Keaten in Geneva and Monika Scislowska in Warsaw contributed to this report.___The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

17-03-2020||World||Iran has temporarily freed 85,000 prisoners, including political ones, amid coronavirus||Iran has temporarily freed about 85,000 prisoners, including political prisoners, a spokesman for its judiciary said on Tuesday, in response to the coronavirus epidemic. “Some 50% of those released are security-related prisoners ... Also in the jails we have taken precautionary measures to confront the outbreak,” said Gholamhossein Esmaili.On March 10, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on human rights in Iran said he had asked Tehran to free all political prisoners temporarily from its overcrowded and disease-ridden jails to help stem the spread of coronavirus. Iran’s death toll from the coronavirus has reached 853 and a total of 14,991 people have been confirmed infected across the country, one of the worst national outbreaks outside China, where the new virus originated. Esmaili did not elaborate on when those released would have to return to jail.Javaid Rehman, the UN special rapporteur on human rights in Iran, said earlier in March that Iranian prisoners have been infected with coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-has-temporarily-freed-85-000-prisoners-including-political-ones-amid-coronavirus/story-8Wh2QZ9RPZ4bYzXvRqM7QP.html

17-03-2020||World||Pakistan PM Imran Khan warns coronavirus may devastate developing nations||Pakistan’s prime minister said Monday he fears the new coronavirus will devastate the economies of developing nations, and warned richer economies to prepare to write off the debts of the world’s poorer countries.In an interview with The Associated Press, Imran Khan criticized recent comments by the president of neighboring Afghanistan, which appeared to reference accusations that Pakistan used militants to further its own goals in years past.Khan also raised concern over India’s worst Hindu-Muslim violence in decades, saying the Indian prime minister’s Hindu nationalist-led government threatens to disenfranchise hundreds of millions of people through a controversial new citizenship law.He further called for lifting sanctions against Iran, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in the Middle East.Khan sat down with the AP at his office in the resplendent white-domed government headquarters in the capital of Islamabad. He’d spent much of his day meeting experts about the effect of the coronavirus outbreak in Pakistan, which has confirmed 183 cases so far.“My worry is poverty and hunger,” Khan said. “The world community has to think of some sort of a debt write-off for countries like us, which are very vulnerable, at least that will help us in coping with (the coronavirus).”He said that if a serious outbreak happens in Pakistan, he’s worried that his government’s efforts to lift the ailing economy out of near-collapse would begin an unstoppable slide backward. Exports would fall off, unemployment would soar and an onerous national debt would become an impossible burden. Pakistan secured a $6 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund last year.The global virus pandemic presents the biggest test yet for Khan’s populist leadership since he took office in 2018. He’s mobilized Pakistan’s young people, who are among his largest followers. His critics say he came to power with the help of the country’s powerful military, and human rights groups say he’s cracked down on critical media outlets.“It’s not just Pakistan. I would imagine the same in India, in the subcontinent, in African countries,” he said, referring to the virus. “If it spreads, we will all have problems with our health facilities. We just don’t have that capability. We just don’t have the resources.”Most people who get the new coronavirus and the COVID-19 illness it causes experience only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, and recover within weeks. But the virus is highly contagious and can be spread by people with no visible symptoms. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.The pandemic comes just as a peace deal between the United States and the Taliban has given Afghanistan its best chance at ending its endless wars, and bringing U.S. troops home after nearly 19 years.But the Taliban have a long and complicated relationship with Pakistan’s military and intelligence services. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani recently said the insurgents need to demonstrate their commitment to peace by extricating themselves from Pakistan’s influence. Some Afghan officials refer to Pakistan — particularly its military — as the Taliban’s “masters.”Khan called Ghani’s comments “disappointing,” and said that since taking office, he’s worked hard with the U.S. to help cobble together a pace deal in Afghanistan.“If anything, it should have been appreciation of the way Pakistan has gone about furthering the peace process,” Khan said.“Pakistan is now a partner in peace for the U.S., which I always thought Pakistan should have been. Pakistan should never have been used as a sort of hired gun, which is the role which Pakistan was playing,” he explained. He said he has always opposed his country’s participation in the “war on terror,” calling it a waste of Pakistani lives and money.Khan said he’s also warned about violent strife on the other side of his eastern border, amid the rise Hindu nationalism in India.“The worst nightmare of the world has happened — an extremist, racial party that believes in racial superiority has taken over a country of more than one billion people and has nuclear weapons,” he said.“That’s when I went to the United Nations” to warn of the danger posed by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist-led government, he said.A new citizenship law in India fast-tracks naturalization for foreign-born religious minorities of all major faiths in South Asia, except Islam. There are about 280 million Muslims there.Since the law’s passing, India has been wracked by some of the worst sectarian violence in decades, as Hindus clashed with Muslims. There’s some evidence of police aiding Hindu extremist attacks against Muslim neighborhoods, setting fire to a mosque.Islamabad and New Delhi have a long history of bitter relations since gaining independence from British colonial rule in 1947.Both sides claim the Himalayan region of Kashmir in its entirety, and the Indian-controlled portion is the only Muslim majority state in India. Tensions have been high there since last year after Modi’s government stripped the portion of Kashmir it controls of semi-autonomy and statehood.In a further call for action from the international community, Khan said it was time to end U.S. sanctions on Iran, where one of the worst coronavirus outbreaks in the world has unfolded. Iran has struggled to respond in part because of crippling sanctions imposed by the Trump administration.The outbreak in Iran has also hit close to home. Most of Pakistan’s cases of the coronavirus and the COVID-19 illness it causes have been traced back to Iran, and all of the 21 Afghans who tested positive had traveled to Iran.Khan said Iran is a “classic example” of a place where the humanitarian imperative to contain the outbreak outweighs political rivalries or economic dogmas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-pm-imran-khan-warns-coronavirus-may-devastate-developing-nations/story-6zQ6aZ62ISA0LbSqj4AruL.html
17-03-2020||World||In coronavirus-hit China, open a bank account, get free masks||China’s banks, aiming to kick start business after the coronavirus outbreak prompted a nationwide shutdown, have found a novel way to lure customers: free masks.Economic activity is starting to get into gear, after a period in which the government cut transport links and locked down cities at the end of January to slow the spread of the contagious virus responsible for over 3,000 deaths in the country.As the number of new virus cases fell, lenders found themselves between policy initiatives to lend to virus-stricken firms, and the prospect of sour debt as companies struggled.To lure much-needed custom, banks across the country have started to offer the hottest commodity in town - masks, popularly believed as helping prevent contagion - to new customers for everything from signing up to an app to opening a deposit account.Though the government has declared the peak of the virus has passed, in some areas masks and disinfectant are still in short supply as cities continue to bar those without masks from entering public places.At China Everbright Bank Co Ltd, customers who link their debit or credit cards to their WeChat pay accounts and transfer 0.01 yuan ($0.0014) will be entitled to five masks.“Everyone is very enthusiastic, it’s hot” said Liu Huan, a person managing the offer at the bank.THE BIG GIVEAWAYAt one branch of the Bank of Wuhai in northern Inner Mongolia, customers receive free masks if they sign up for fixed-term deposits of over 10,000 yuan ($1,428.78) or buy 50,000 yuan worth of wealth management products, among other offerings, showed a post on the lender’s WeChat account.The Hunan Hengdong Rural Commercial Bank said in late February it would give customers who made deposits masks, disinfectant and alcohol wipes.Last week, Zhejiang Mintai Commercial Bank said it would give masks to those aged over 50 who signed up to their app.Even Panzhou Wanhe Country Bank, a rural lender with just five branches in remote Liupanshui in Guizhou province, began giving out two free masks to anyone opening accounts from March 6.In a more creative giveaway, in the coastal city of Qingdao, local branches of the state-owned Postal Savings Bank of China Co Ltd had 100 masks a day up for grabs, which could be won by mobile clients entering a lottery.Before the outbreak, China’s banks were already under pressure as loan prime rate reform shaved margins and the U.S.-Sino trade war deterred borrowing in the manufacturing.On Monday, China’s economic indicators plunged to historic lows, evidence that the impact of the virus may be far worse than widely expected and is likely to weigh further on already struggling banks.While insurers are faring better, many are also dangling free masks and other necessities as incentives.In Shangahi, managers at the giant Ping An Insurance Group Co of China Ltd have been giving away masks, sanitiser and alcohol spray to clients since late-February, according to social media posts.Their marketing phrase: “Masks give you one-off protection, but insurance protection is for life.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-coronavirus-hit-china-open-a-bank-account-get-free-masks/story-2fHkdYgnEooVtqtkwCKAJN.html
17-03-2020||World||US, China accuse each other of coronavirus fear-mongering||The United States and China on Monday each demanded that the other stop smearing its reputation over the novel coronavirus as Donald Trump referred to the pathogen as the “Chinese Virus.”“The United States will be powerfully supporting those industries, like Airlines and others, that are particularly affected by the Chinese Virus,” the US president tweeted Monday night.Trump’s allies had previously referred to the pandemic as the “Chinese coronavirus,” but the tweet marks the first time the president said it himself.Critics slammed the move, calling it racist and potentially inciting a backlash against the Asian-American community.“Our Asian-American communities -- people YOU serve -- are already suffering. They don’t need you fueling more bigotry,” tweeted New York city mayor Bill de Blasio, whose state is one of the hardest-hit by the virus in the US.The clash came on the day that the World Health Organization said more cases and deaths had been reported in the rest of the world than in China, where the new coronavirus virus was first detected late last year.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in a phone call he initiated with top Chinese official Yang Jiechi, voiced anger that Beijing has used official channels “to shift blame for COVID-19 to the United States,” the State Department said.Pompeo “stressed that this is not the time to spread disinformation and outlandish rumors, but rather a time for all nations to come together to fight this common threat,” the department added.The State Department on Friday summoned the Chinese ambassador, Cui Tiankai, to denounce Beijing’s promotion of a conspiracy theory that had gained wide attention on social media. Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian, in tweets last week in both Mandarin and English, suggested that “patient zero” in the global pandemic may have come from the United States -- not the Chinese metropolis of Wuhan. “It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation,” tweeted Zhao, who is known for his provocative statements on social media.Scientists suspect that the virus first came to humans at a meat market in Wuhan that butchered exotic animals.‘Stern warning’ to US Pompeo himself has sought to link China to the global pandemic, repeatedly referring to SARS-CoV-2 as the “Wuhan virus” despite advice from health professionals that such geographic labels can be stigmatizing.Yang issued a “stern warning to the United States that any scheme to smear China will be doomed to fail,” the official Xinhua news agency said in its summary of the call with Pompeo.The key Chinese foreign policy leader “noted that some US politicians have frequently slandered China and its anti-epidemic efforts and stigmatized the country, which has enraged the Chinese people,” Xinhua said.“He urged the US side to immediately correct its wrongful behavior and stop making groundless accusations against China.”President Donald Trump is under fire over his handling of the pandemic, and his allies have sought to cast the coronavirus as a disease brought by foreigners.Republican Senator Tom Cotton, a Trump ally, has spoken of the “Chinese coronavirus” and in a recent statement vowed, “we will hold accountable those who inflicted it on the world.”While COVID-19 -- the disease caused by the virus -- has largely come under control in China, it has killed more than 7,000 people around the world and severely disrupted daily life in Western countries.The pandemic comes at a time of wide-ranging tensions between the United States and China on issues from trade to human rights to Beijing’s military buildup.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-china-accuse-each-other-of-coronavirus-fear-mongering/story-2pq9gLO4nrY3ItRuqgwhJM.html
17-03-2020||World||No one knows how many virus cases North Korea has. It says zero||Bordered by China and South Korea, two early victims of coronavirus, Kim Jong Un’s North Korea claims it has evaded the pandemic with no cases of infection. Diplomats and experts piecing together the clues see a different picture.Kim brought his already isolated country to a near standstill by sealing the borders in January to stop the virus, which halted the trickle of legal trade and tourism. But even that may not have been enough. The U.S. is “fairly certain” there are coronavirus cases in North Korea because of a noticeable lack of military activity, General Robert Abrams, commander of U.S. Forces Korea, told reporters in a teleconference briefing last Friday.“Their armed forces has been fundamentally -- been on lockdown for about 30 days, and only recently have they started routine training again,” Abrams said March 13. “They didn’t fly an airplane for 24 days.”Due to a crumbling medical system, sanctions restricting trade and decades of economic mismanagement that have left more than 40% of its population chronically undernourished and vulnerable to disease, North Korea runs enormous risks of a coronavirus outbreak turning into a humanitarian disaster that could lead to mass deaths and leave it as a disease reservoir as the tide turns in Asia.Those concerns have prompted aid organizations and North Korean allies like Russia to rush in medical supplies and others to offer help.While there is little chance of the virus crossing the fenced-off, heavily militarized border with South Korea, the 880-mile (1,420-kilometer) border with China is porous, and the black-market traders who have crossed for years from both sides could be a source bringing the virus into North Korea. The case count in the two biggest Chinese provinces bordering North Korea -- Liaoning and Jilin -- have been relatively low so far at about 225 total as of last week, according to the World Health OrganizationNorth Korea is largely a black box to the outside world and what it has said in its official media is that it has kept the virus from entering the country through mass disinfection and by placing thousands of people into quarantine. So far, more than 5,400 have been released and no infections found, it said, but a doctor in South Korea who heads the Association of Healthcare for Korean Unification said he suspects the vigorous denials could be masking a real problem.“Since the tone of the reporting is so strong, North Korea probably does have its own patients of the virus,” said Kim Sin-gon, a professor at Korea University’s Department of Internal Medicine in Seoul. He added the malnutrition could facilitate the spread of the disease.North Korea has demonstrated it can stamp out a virus effectively, and the World Health Organization in 2018 praised it for successfully eliminating measles. If the coronavirus that has infected more than 166,000 people worldwide has spilled into North Korea, leader Kim can use his authoritarian powers to round up and isolate the infected, lock down affected regions and seal off information about what is going on. Death tolls from the virus may not have much of an impact on a regime with such total control that it was able to weather a famine in the 1990s that killed an estimated 240,000 to 3.5 million people.“There’s no human rights or social freedom concerns, there’s probably no concern for people starving to death,” said Thomas Byrne, president of the Korea Society, who teaches international affairs at Columbia University. “They can really enforce social distancing.”Ready To HelpKim’s military hasn’t been totally silent. The country fired what appeared to be five short-range ballistic missiles off its eastern coast earlier this month in two volleys a week apart, a move denounced by officials in Japan and South Korea. Some analysts saw that as an effort to ensure the country remains on the agenda for other nations amid the virus outbreak.Officials at North Korea’s mission to the United Nations didn’t respond to a request for comment. South Korea’s Unification Ministry said Tuesday that it won’t comment beyond what has been reported in North Korea’s state media about infections.North Korea isn’t adverse to receiving overseas aid in times of need, often framing the donations in its domestic propaganda as tributes from abroad to its leaders -- not as charity.Russia has delivered virus test kits to Pyongyang while the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have called for sanctions exemptions so it can transfer money into its North Korea office. South Korea also stands ready to help.World Health Organization officials say they aren’t aware of any cases though they are planning to send equipment and supplies to North Korea as well. Even the U.S. State Department offered to send aid and work with international organizations to prevent a humanitarian crisis there.A spokesperson for Doctors Without Borders said in response to an email query that the group received an official request from North Korea in February to “strengthen the national capacity should there be an outbreak of COVID-19 (coronavirus).”The UN Security Council, which is responsible for enforcing stringent sanctions on North Korea, recently made humanitarian exemptions to allow for medical supplies. German Ambassador Christoph Heusgen, who heads the committee in charge of UN sanctions, said the key now is to allow equipment in so that the population “can be protected.”Despite the denials, North Korea may be facing its biggest public health challenge since Kim took power in late 2011.“It’s hard to imagine that North Korea could dodge the COVID-19 bullet,” said Keith Luse, executive director of the National Committee on North Korea who, in his previous role as a Senate staff member, visited the country five times to review the distribution of U.S. aid.(Adds comment from South Korea ministry)--With assistance from Larry Liebert and Kanga Kong.To contact the reporters on this story: David Wainer in New York at dwainer3@bloomberg.net;Jihye Lee in Seoul at jlee2352@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Bill Faries at wfaries@bloomberg.net, Jon HerskovitzFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-one-knows-how-many-virus-cases-north-korea-has-it-says-zero/story-IdkAqzRrejOB6Q4WI6jtHL.html
17-03-2020||World||Philippines first nation to suspend all financial markets as coronavirus spreads||The Philippine Stock Exchange closed indefinitely on Tuesday while currency and bond trading were suspended, the first market shutdowns worldwide in response to the coronavirus, with authorities citing risks to the safety of traders.The shutdown comes after some bourses around the world closed trading floors or paused trade after withering falls in market value, but it is the first blanket market halt.And while it was done for health reasons, amid a broad lockdown in the Philippines, it raises the prospect other exchanges may follow and has drawn analysts’ attention.“Given the unprecedented speed of the slump in equity prices, it has been suggested that stock exchanges might be closed soon if things don’t turn around,” research house Capital Economics said in a note on Tuesday.AdMacro research head Patrick Perret-Green had also raised the possibility in a note issued over the weekend, before the Philippines move.“We have seen it before. I believe we could see it again,” he said. “Governments do not need or want the added stress and distraction at this time.”The Philippine Stock Exchange said trade was suspended until further notice “to ensure the safety of employees and traders,” amid a broader national lockdown.National Treasurer Rosalia de Leon cited the lockdown as the reason for the suspension of fixed income trade. Currency trading is to resume on March 18.In Malaysia, where a similar lockdown comes into force on March 18, the securities regulator said all capital markets will operate as usual.CME Group Inc last week shut its storied trading floor in Chicago, to reduce large gatherings, and Mideast bourses have taken similar measures, though electronic trade remains available.Kuwait’s exchange has suspended trade at least twice this month, after daily falls of more than 10%, while in Indonesia, Jakarta’s bourse has introduced new circuit breakers which halt trading for half an hour if the main index falls 5%.That comes amid a swathe of short-selling restrictions in markets from South Korea to Italy and Spain.Capital Economics, however, said closures are ineffective at salving investor sentiment. The consultancy expects - as in the Philippines - health reasons to be invoked should other bourses shut.“On the rare occasions when stock markets have been shut in the U.S. in the past, it has usually only been for practical reasons, such as after 9/11, rather than as means of trying to restore confidence...(It) might not work in any case.“Investors might end up selling anything else they could if they needed to raise cash in a hurry.”Global markets are in meltdown as the pandemic spreads, with roughly $14 trillion in shareholder value erased and even safe assets such as gold have been sold to cover losses. The Philippines benchmark index fell 8% on Monday and is down 20% for March so far, already its worst since October 2008. “Eventually they will open,” said Mathan Somasundaram, market porfolio strategist at stockbroker Blue Ocean Equities in Sydney.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/philippines-first-country-to-suspend-all-financial-markets-as-coronavirus-spreads/story-secoazy1FdNfIGNEvZza9H.html
17-03-2020||World||Coronavirus sends US economic powerhouse San Francisco into lockdown||The San Francisco Bay Area’s economy enters a three-week lockdown at midnight in order to slow the spread of the coronavirus, with six regional counties directing residents to keep to their homes as much as possible.As of Monday morning, Bay Area counties were reporting 273 cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Six people have died of the respiratory illness in California.POWERHOUSEThe six counties under the lockdown order accounted for $877 billion of economic output in 2018. That’s about 30% of California’s economy, the biggest in the United States. That makes the collective economy of the six counties bigger than Sweden, and nearly the half the size of all of Italy, whose residents went under a similar lockdown a week ago.PEOPLE, JOBSThe area has a population of about 6.7 million people, and employs 3.5 million, data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows. It is unclear how many of those will be considered essential employees, but it is safe to say that the large majority will be required to stay home.Some public sector jobs, including police and firefighters, as well as healthcare, utilities and sanitation workers, will be allowed to carry on as usual. So will grocery stores and food delivery, including take-out.THERE ARE SOME BIG COMPANIES HERETechnology looms large: Apple, Google Inc.-parent Alphabet, Facebook and Intel are the Bay Area’s biggest companies by market capitalization. They were among the first to ask employees to work from home.Less well known: the region has the largest cluster of biotech companies in the country. Healthcare and professional services employ large numbers of people, and tourism is also a key business, says Sean Randolph, senior director of the Bay Area Council Economic Institute.“I just do worry a lot now about what the impacts over the longer term are going to be and all the people out there who are in fact economically vulnerable,” he said in a phone interview from his office, where he was collecting physical documents that he may need once he begins working from home on Tuesday.LAYOFFS ARE STARTINGGinger Rowe, founder and owner of a casual clothing shop in Los Gatos in the South Bay, told Reuters she is closing shop and laying off her three employees as of Tuesday.“At least they can claim unemployment insurance because that’s what they and we pay for. And because, with not having any revenue or sales or anything, I won’t be able to continue paying them .... I can have my employees hopefully reinstated after this craziness.”SOME HELPAfter the U.S Department of Labor changed its rules last week to allow workers to apply for unemployment benefits even if they are only expected to be temporarily unemployed, California Governor Gavin Newsom opened applications to people whose hours are reduced or jobs eliminated due to the virus. Some cities, including San Francisco, have banned evictions of residents who do not pay rent because of virus-related hardship.HOMELESSNESSThe Bay Area has 28,000 people who do not have permanent places to live, the third-largest homeless population in the country behind New York City and Los Angeles, according to a report last April from the Bay Area Council Economic Institute. The homeless are exempt from the order to remain at home, although cities say they are making efforts to shelter them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-sends-us-economic-powerhouse-san-francisco-into-lockdown/story-sKMVCLMur6itTFFxV8A1FJ.html
17-03-2020||World||China reports just 1 new domestic coronavirus case, global death toll crosses 7000||China reported on Tuesday just one new domestic coronavirus infection but found 20 more cases imported from abroad, threatening to spoil its progress against the disease.The single case in Wuhan will boost China’s view that it has “basically curbed” the spread of a disease that is believed to have emerged in a live animal market in the central city in December.Wuhan and its 11 million people were placed under strict quarantine on January 23, with the rest of Hubei province going under lockdown in the following days.Authorities tightened restrictions in the city even further on February 11, confining people to their homes as health workers faced a daily deluge of well over 1,000 cases -- a move officials say was critical in containing the virus.Other cities across the country enacted further measures to compel most people to stay indoors, and no new domestic infections have been detected outside Hubei for many days in a row.But the country is now concerned about an influx of cases from abroad, with an average of 20,000 people flying into China every day.Beijing started on Monday to require almost all international arrivals to go into 14-day quarantine in designated hotels. People who live alone, minors, the elderly, pregnant women and people with underlying conditions are allowed to confine themselves at home.Nine of the 20 new imported cases were in Beijing and three in Shanghai, raising the total number of confirmed infections from abroad to 143, according to the National Health Commission.China also reported 13 deaths, raising its toll to 3,226.The country has recorded 80,881 total cases, but fewer than 9,000 people remain infected.The country’s progress stands in stark contrast with the growing crisis in other countries, with the World Health Organization saying there were now more deaths and cases outside China.The number of deaths worldwide has passed 7,000, with more than 181,500 cases in 145 countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-reports-just-1-new-domestic-coronavirus-case-global-death-toll-crosses-7000/story-UGCYHR7QJxjZFD9RDkHM2N.html
17-03-2020||World||‘Test, test, test’: WHO chief’s coronavirus message to world to slow advance of pandemic||The World Health Organization called on all countries on Monday to ramp up their testing programs as the best way to slow the advance of the coronavirus pandemic.“We have a simple message to all countries - test, test, test,” WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a press conference in Geneva.“All countries should be able to test all suspected cases, they cannot fight this pandemic blindfolded,” he added.In the United States, the Trump administration has come under fire from critics for what they say has been a slow gearing up of testing for the new virus.U.S. Vice President Mike Pence promised on Sunday that Americans would have access in the days ahead to more than 2,000 laboratories capable of processing tests.With limited testing available, U.S. officials have recorded nearly 3,000 cases and 62 deaths, and large segments of daily activities have been upended across the country. Without testing, cases could not be isolated and the chain of infection would not be broken, Tedros said.Even countries with advanced health systems have struggled to cope with the outbreak, Tedros said, adding he was deeply concerned about its effects on low-income countries where people already struggled with malnutrition and other health problems.The strategy to contain the disease, by finding people with infections and rapidly isolating them, was still the best approach, said the WHO chief. It had shown positive effects in China, South Korea and Singapore, he added.Meanwhile Tedros said he was cheered by the response from governments coming forward with funding to fight the outbreak.“It’s not just the funding, it is human spirit which we see, that is fighting this virus, that is coming more strongly,” he added. “I am really encouraged in the last week or so with the solid level of solidarity I see.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/test-test-test-who-chief-s-coronavirus-message-to-world-to-slow-advance-of-pandemic/story-UR7UENoBj50WsPzuDda0YI.html

17-03-2020||World||US Supreme Court postpones next set of arguments amid coronavirus outbreak||The U.S. Supreme Court postponed a two-week argument session that had been set to start next week, making a highly unusual calendar change as the coronavirus outbreak spreads across the country.It’s the first time in decades, and perhaps a century, that the court has cancelled a courtroom session because of a public-health scare.The court had been set to hear arguments in 11 cases during the weeks of March 23 and March 30. Those cases include an $8 billion copyright clash between Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Oracle Corp., set for argument March 24.The court was also planning March 31 arguments on President Donald Trump’s challenge to subpoenas for his financial information issued by three House committees and a New York grand jury. Trump is trying to block his banks and accounting firm from turning over the records.The court said in a statement it will “examine the options for rescheduling those cases in due course in light of the developing circumstances.”The move follows similar steps by courts around the country, as judges delayed trials and modified argument procedures to avoid or limit in-person sessions.The Supreme Court said other business will proceed as scheduled. The justices will hold their planned private conference this Friday, though some justices may participate by telephone. The court said it will issue a list of orders in pending cases as scheduled next Monday.Two of the court’s nine members are in their 80s -- Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who turned 87 Sunday, and Justice Stephen Breyer, 81. Four others are 65 or older: Justice Clarence Thomas, 71; Justice Samuel Alito, 69; Justice Sonia Sotomayor, 65; and Chief Justice John Roberts, 65. Elderly people are at increased risk of dying should they contract the coronavirus.Spanish FluThe Supreme Court has long been loath to change its public schedule. The court postponed cases for several weeks during the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic and shortened its argument calendars in 1793 and 1798 because of yellow fever outbreaks. In 2001, the justices held arguments for a week at a federal appeals court in Washington after anthrax was discovered in a Supreme Court mail facility.The court building closed to the general public last week but remains open for official business. The court said Monday it is “expanding remote working capabilities to reduce the number of employees in the building, consistent with public health guidance.”In addition to the now-postponed March sitting, the court has one more two-week argument session on its calendar, currently set to start April 20. That session includes a case that could affect the 2020 presidential election, a fight over “faithless electors” who refuse to cast their Electoral College votes for the candidate who won their state’s balloting.The court in April is also planning to consider the Trump administration’s bid to give employers and universities the broad right to claim a religious or moral exemption from the Obamacare requirement that they offer free birth control through their health-care plans.Chicago and New YorkThe Supreme Court’s statement made no mention of plans for opinions. The court normally announces opinions from the bench but may now need to change that practice.The justices are working on rulings in already-argued cases involving LGBT job discrimination, the Puerto Rico oversight board, the DACA deferred-deportation program, New York City gun-transportation rules, abortion restrictions and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.The nine-month term typically ends in late June, though the court could extend the term into July or beyond if needed.Elsewhere, Cook County, Illinois, which includes Chicago, is delaying almost all cases for 30 days starting Tuesday, according to a statement from the chief judge.The New York state court system on Sunday was ordered to postpone all non-essential functions as of 5 p.m. Monday, although all ongoing trials will continue to their conclusions.The state’s top court, the seven-judge Court of Appeals in Albany, is still scheduled to hear arguments for cases in its March term starting Tuesday, although some of them could be conducted remotely, according to spokesman Gary Spencer.Grand JuriesFederal courts in Maryland, Virginia and Texas became the latest to postpone trials in response to the coronavirus outbreak. The federal district court in Alexandria, Virginia, postponed all criminal and civil jury trials until April 17. Its Maryland counterpart delayed all new jury trials until April 24 and also suspended ongoing matters until March 27, unless judges overseeing individual cases ordered otherwise.Massachusetts and Connecticut federal courts took similar action last week. The federal court in San Antonio, Texas, put off all new trials until May 1. In a concession, however, to the district’s “extremely large criminal caseload,” the court said it would continue grand jury proceedings that issue charges.Cook County is likewise carrying on with grand juries as normal. New York said currently seated grand juries would continue, but new ones would not be convened.The California Supreme Court suspended in-person oral arguments. Although arguments will continue to be held in the court’s San Francisco courtroom, lawyers will now appear through electronic means.The U.S. International Trade Commission, which hears a variety of cross-border tariff and intellectual property disputes, has postponed all hearings for 60 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-supreme-court-postpones-next-set-of-arguments-amid-coronavirus-outbreak/story-ERVfWS27qFKtXt4jBsspWO.html
17-03-2020||World||US begins first human trial of coronavirus vaccine||The first human trial to evaluate a candidate vaccine against the new coronavirus has begun in Seattle, US health officials said Monday, raising hopes in the global fight against the disease.But it may be another year to 18 months before it becomes available, once it has passed more trial phases to prove it works and is safe.The vaccine is called mRNA-1273 and was developed by US National Institutes of Health (NIH) scientists and collaborators at biotechnology company Moderna, which is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts.Also Watch | US President Donald Trump announces first human trial of coronavirus vaccine“The open-label trial will enroll 45 healthy adult volunteers ages 18 to 55 years over approximately 6 weeks,” the NIH said. “The first participant received the investigational vaccine today.”Funding was also provided by the Oslo-based Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI).There are currently no approved vaccines or treatments against the coronavirus disease, known as COVID-19, which has infected more than 175,000 people across the world since it was first identified in central China in late December.It has claimed 7,000 deaths, according to an AFP tally, most in China followed by Italy.“Finding a safe and effective vaccine to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 is an urgent public health priority,” said Anthony Fauci, head of infectious diseases at the NIH, using the technical name for the virus that is believed to have originated in bats.“This Phase 1 study, launched in record speed, is an important first step toward achieving that goal.”The Seattle trial will study the impact of different doses delivered by intramuscular injection in the upper arm, with participants monitored for side-effects like soreness or fever.Coronaviruses are spherical and have spikes protruding from their surface, giving them a crown-like appearance. The spike binds to human cells, allowing the virus to gain entry.The Moderna candidate vaccine carries the genetic information of this spike in a substance called “messenger RNA.”Injecting human tissue with the spike’s messenger RNA makes it grow inside the body, thereby eliciting an immune response without having actually infected a person with the full-blown virus.- Global race -Pharmaceuticals and research labs around the world are racing to develop both treatments and vaccines to the new coronavirus.An antiviral treatment called remdesivir, made by US-based Gilead Sciences, is already in the final stages of clinical trials in Asia and doctors in China have reported it has proven effective in fighting the disease.But only randomized trials allow scientists to know for sure whether it really helps or whether patients would have recovered without it.Another US pharma called Inovio, which is creating a DNA-based vaccine, has said it will enter clinical trials next month. Regeneron is trying to isolate coronavirus-fighting antibodies that can be administered intravenously to confer temporary immunity, and hopes to start human trials by summer.According to the World Health Organization, 80 percent of COVID-19 cases are mild, 14 percent are severe and about five percent result are critical, resulting in severe respiratory illness that causes the lungs to fill with fluid which in turn prevents oxygen from reaching organs.Patients with mild cases recover in a week or two while severe cases can take six or more weeks.Recent estimates suggest about one percent of all infected people die.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-begins-first-human-trial-of-coronavirus-vaccine/story-KcBpX7KhtNWLQN61ESGEsK.html
17-03-2020||World||Indian-origin Jew beaten in coronavirus-linked hate crime in Israel: Report||An Indian-origin Jew was badly beaten by two persons who called him a “Chinese” and yelled ‘Corona! Corona” in Israel’s Tiberias city, in an apparent racist assault linked to the virus outbreak. Am-Shalem Singson, 28, from the Bnei Menashe community, hailing from the north-eastern states of Manipur and Mizoram, was admitted to the Poriya hospital with severe chest injuries, Channel 13 reported.The police continues to search for the two suspects based on his description of the incident, the leading Israeli TV channel reported.Singson told the police that he tried very hard to explain to the attackers that he was not Chinese and was not infected by the coronavirus, but it did not help.The incident happened on Saturday.Singson is a resident of the Ma’alot area and immigrated to Israel from India with his family three years ago, the report said.There were no witnesses to the incident and the police search is primarily based on the security footage in the area. “We were shocked to receive the report of the vicious and racist attack in Tiberias,” Michael Freund, Chairman and Founder of Shavei Israel, the organisation that has been working on the immigration of Bnei Menashe to Israel, was quoted by the Channel as saying.“I demand that the Israeli police investigate the incident immediately and prosecute those who committed this heinous act,” Freund said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-origin-jew-beaten-in-coronavirus-linked-hate-crime-in-israel-report/story-eh837SnHfm6IXU8iWIl5zN.html
17-03-2020||World||‘We’re at war’: France confines residents mostly to homes to contain coronavirus||France said Monday that it would follow other European countries in confining residents mostly to their homes during the COVID-19 pandemic, while the European Union considered closing its external borders to foreign travelers to impede infections.French President Emmanuel Macron said that starting on Tuesday, people would be allowed to leave the place they live only for necessary activities such as shopping for food, going to work or taking a walk.“From tomorrow at noon and for at least 15 days, our trips will be greatly reduced” Macron said in a televised address.Macron said the government would provide further details, but he told the French people that everyone should stay at home, go out just for the “bare essentials” and commute to work only if working from home isn’t feasible.Anyone caught violating the new measures will be punished, he said.The restrictions appeared to put France under a lockdown similar to the ones imposed last week in Italy and Spain in response to the virus. While the restrictions are in effect, residential gatherings with family and friends will be prohibited, the president said.“We are at war,” Macron said repeatedly in his address.French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner subsequently specified that all people circulating on France’s streets will have to justify, upon request, why they were out and about. Forms stating the purpose of “essential” outside travel — such as going to the bakery to buy a baguette — will be available for downloading, Castaner said.People without valid reasons will be subject fines ranging from 38-135 euros ($43-$151), the minister said. Castaner said 100,000 police would be deployed in the coming days to enforce the lockdown.The French plan was announced almost a week after a nationwide lockdown took effect in Italy, the country with the most reported virus cases in the world except for China.Spain followed suit over the weekend, while other EU nations have adopted ad hoc national measures, including partial border closures.As of earlier Monday, six of the 10 countries with the highest numbers of reported virus cases worldwide are in Europe: Italy, Spain, Germany, France, Switzerland and the U.K. France has reported a total of 6,633 cases, including 148 deaths.British authorities also ramped up public health measures Monday, telling people who are in the groups considered most vulnerable to severe COVID-19 illness to stay at home for three months.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said people with “the most serious health conditions” should be “shielded” from social contacts for 12 weeks, starting this weekend. He mentioned people over 70, those with chronic illnesses and pregnant women as particularly at risk.It was unclear whether everyone in the those groups was being told to stay home for 12 weeks. Johnson said the government was advising the entire population “to stop non-essential contact with others and to stop all unnecessary travel.”“You should avoid pubs, clubs, theaters and other such social venues,” he said at a news conference alongside his chief medical and scientific advisers.For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.While national governments across Europe have taken a range of measures to contain the virus from moving into and within their countries, the 27 members of the European Union are looking at closing the EU’s external borders to most foreign travelers.In recent days, the EU has been urging its members to put common health screening procedures in place at internal borders but not to block shipments of medical equipment. EU officials fear that countries acting alone and without coordination might make things more difficult for neighbors whose health-care systems are already creaking.The proposed travel restrictions will be put to to the bloc’s 27 leaders at a summit to be held via video-conference Tuesday. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the plan calls for them to be in place for an initial period of 30 days.Exemptions could be given to long-term residents in the EU, border area workers, family members of European nationals and diplomats. British citizens would not be included in the ban, even though the country officially withdrew from the EU on Jan. 31“Essential staff such as doctors, nurses, care workers, researchers and experts that help address the coronavirus should continue to be allowed in the EU,” von der Leyen said.Transport workers also could receive exemptions to ensure supplies of “essential items such as medicine, but also food and components that our factories need,” she said.Asked whether she thinks Europe will return to having its passport-free travel area once the pandemic subsides, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she hoped so and noted that so far “coordination didn’t work well everywhere the way one would have hoped.”Merkel added that public health strategies in the EU should guarantee goods flow freely and ensure that Europeans can continue making cross-border commutes for work.“We will certainly need to continue talking (about this) in a European format,” she said. “But from our perspective, these are time-limited measures that serve to reduce the risk of infection.”Germany was preparing to shut non-essential shops, bars, museums and many other facilities and to limit restaurant opening times. Merkel’s office said Monday that overnight hotel stays will be allowed only for “necessary and expressly not for tourist purposes.”Greek authorities announced that anyone entering the country from abroad would be subject to compulsory self-quarantine for 14 days. The health ministry’s top infectious diseases official, Sotiris Tsiodras, noted that many young people were returning “from countries where there is a large spread of the virus, such as the United Kingdom, whose public health strategy is to allow the virus to spread.”Separately Monday, the Russian government announced that it has decided to bar entry to all foreigners starting Wednesday and until May 1. The move will not apply to diplomats, foreigners permanently staying in Russia, plane and ship crews and truck drivers.Ukraine’s president also instructed his Cabinet to close the subway, shopping malls and restaurants, cut passenger train and air links, and to ban gatherings of more than 10 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-re-at-war-france-confines-residents-mostly-to-homes-to-contain-coronavirus/story-SUdKtqwOUHV4z1Tv8Dm0mM.html

Sharma, 72, said he is self-isolating for seven days on the advice of the National Health Service (NHS) even as he is yet to be declared positive for the virus.Hailing from Jalandhar district in Punjab, he said: “While in isolation I am still working for the people of Ealing Southall, but I’m particularly disappointed I won’t be able to speak in the budget debate this week”.“The important work of holding the government to account is still going on and I am working by email and phone in the best interests of all my constituents. My office will not be open, but you can still contact me and my team over the phone,” Sharma added.Urging constituents to contact the NHS if feeling unwell, Sharma asked them to see as few people at possible, and thanked “all the amazing staff in our NHS, and other public services, working so hard to keep us safe and healthy at such a difficult time”.Parliament has not been suspended but several ministers and MPs have been working from home as a precaution.
