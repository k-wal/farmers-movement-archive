The state department raised travel warning advisory for Americans travelling to South Korea and Italy, which are reporting an increasing number of cases, to the highest level. More restrictions are expected, including along the southern border.ALSO WATCH | Coronavirus: Doctors monitor evacuees from China at Delhi quarantine centreThe Trump administration’s initial response to the outbreak and rising concerns in the United States was seen as marked by confusion and bureaucratic infighting, some of which appears to have continued. Acknowledging the first death from COVID-19 in the US, President Donald Trump misidentified the victim as a woman, telling reporters at a White House briefing Saturday she was “a wonderful woman -- a medically high-risk patient in her late fifties”. The victim was a man.The United States has 22 reported cases of coronavirus and health officials have warned there are more but have also sought to reassure Americans that their risk of contracting the illness was “low”.“Additional cases in the United States are likely, but healthy individuals should be able to fully recover,” Trump told reporters, and seeking to address American directly, he added, “healthy people, if you’re healthy, you will probably go through a process and you’ll be fine”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-announces-new-travel-restrictions-to-combat-coronavirus-outbreak/story-fhBMljQcHDeVb5XtQzb7vJ.html
01-03-2020||World||Joe Biden storms back into the race with big win in South Carolina||Former Vice-President Joe Biden posted a decisive win in the South Carolina primaries Saturday that is expected to re-energize his flagging campaign and potentially reshape the Democratic race for the presidential nomination.“Just days ago the press and the pundits had declared this candidacy dead,” said Biden at a victory rally in Columbia, the capital of South Carolina. “Now, thanks to you — the heart of the Democratic Party — we haven’t just won. We won big, and we are very much alive.”Biden’s emphatic victory effectively ended Senator Bernie Sanders’ winning spree that started in Iowa and continued through New Hampshire to Nevada last week. The former vice-president won 48% of the popular beating the senator, who came second, by almost 30 points.The Democratic race for the presidential nomination now moves to the Super Tuesday primaries/caucuses in 14 states on March 3, which together hold 34% of the 3,979 delegates who will elect the nominee at the party’s convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in July. The winner needs more than 1,981. Sanders leads in the delegate count with 57; Biden is second with 51.The former vice-president entered the race as the frontrunner and remains to lead in the aggregate of polls, but has conceded the that status to Sanders, who has been surging in polls and, more importantly, won three of four nominating contests held thus far, narrowly.The decisive win in South Carolina is expected to bring Biden’s campaign more energy — he certainly looked more pumped up at the victory rally that he has in a long time — and more money; for a leading candidate he has been unusually cash-strapped and often called broke.The former VP is appealing to moderates in the party has had to compete for their support with former mayor Pete Buttigieg, senator Amy Klobuchar and billionaire Michael Bloomberg. Tom Steyer, the other billionaire in the race dropped out after the South Carolina primary. Progressives, including Indian American lawmakers Ro Khanna and Pramila Jayapal, have backed Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren. But with Warren performing poorly in the primaries and caucuses, progressives are rallying around Sander.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-storms-back-into-the-race-with-big-win-in-south-carolina/story-zVolgTSxsxElMPQA17be1J.html
01-03-2020||World||Coronavirus death toll in Iran rises to 54, over 978 infected||Iran’s health ministry raised on Sunday the nationwide death toll from the new coronavirus to 54 as the number of confirmed infected cases jumped overnight by more than half to 978 people.The ministry’s spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said new cases were confirmed in a number of cities, including Mashhad, which is home to Iran’s most important Shiite shrine that attracts pilgrims from across the region. Calls by Iran’s civilian government to clerics to close such shrines to to the public have not been uniformly followed. The shrine in Mashhad is among those that have remained open.The new figures represent 11 more deaths than reported on Saturday and a whopping 385 new cases of infections. The new numbers, however, bring down the percentage of deaths to infections to around 5.5%. Still, that is much higher than other countries, suggesting the number of infections in Iran may be much higher than current figures show.Jahanpour said in his daily briefing that the number of cases is “still inclining” across Iran.Of the 385 newly confirmed cases, 170 are in Tehran, where schools and cinemas have remained closed for the second week. Public buses and the metro are still operating, but are being disinfected daily there.The ministry spokesman said that 44 cases were also confirmed for the first time in the central Markazi province.Also on Sunday, Iran’s state broadcaster said all flights to and from the city of Rasht, the capital of nothern Gilan province, had been suspended. It gave no reasons why. The area of Gilan has some of Iran’s highest number of infections after the capital, Tehran, and the holy city of Qom, the epicenter of the virus outbreak in the country.The Revolutionary Guard said it plans to install mobile hospitals in Qom and Rasht cities, where the virus has infected high numbers of people. The Guard has also been photographed in state media leading disinfection efforts in some cities.Ali Reza Jalali, the head of the Guard’s medical college, told state TV that Iran is going through a “hard time and dangerous period”. He claimed the group is researching a possible vaccine for the disease.There is currently no vaccine for the novel coronavirus. Researchers around the world are working to find one, but anything widely usable is likely more than a year away.The illness, known as COVID-19 and that originated in central China, has infected at least seven government officials in Iran, including one of its vice presidents and a senior health ministry official.After days of assurances that the virus was largely under control, officials recently acknowledged Iran is preparing for the possibility of “tens of thousands” of people getting tested for the virus behind the outbreak.The first cases were not reported in Iran until Feb. 19, the same day that the two elderly infected people died. Since then, of the more than 1,100 cases in the Middle East, the majority trace back to Iran. Cases from Iran have been reported in Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Lebanon, Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan.Starting on Sunday, all nurseries in the UAE licensed by the education ministry were closed for at least two weeks to limit the spread of the virus, and Kuwait suspended school until March 12.The virus has infected more than 86,000 people worldwide and caused more than 2,900 deaths since emerging in China. Iran has the world’s highest death toll outside of China, where there has been 2,870 deaths among close to 80,000 cases.The outbreak in Iran has prompted its neighbours to seal their borders to Iranians, while other Gulf states have halted flights to Iran. On Saturday, the US announced heightened warnings about travel to certain regions of Italy and South Korea, as well as a ban on travel to Iran, due to the virus.Ali Ahmadi, a resident in Tehran, said the US has already made it difficult for Iranians, including its scientists, to travel there.“Now that the virus has appeared, we expect nothing less from America,” he said, expressing widespread frustration with U.S. policies on Iran.Islam’s holiest sites in Saudi Arabia have been closed to foreign pilgrims to limit the spread of the virus. The kingdom does not have any reported cases of the virus, and has halted all fights to and from China and Iran.One of the most important Shiite shrines in the world in Iraq’s Najaf city has also closed to Iranian pilgrims after a student from Iran studying there was confirmed to have the highly infectious virus.Saeed Moghaddam, also in Tehran, said Iranians are suffering because of a virus that came from China“We are not the cause of this virus spreading in other countries. We are battling with this ourselves,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-death-toll-in-iran-rises-to-54-over-978-infected/story-T7nPgr1SMa13xUgoXg69UN.html

01-03-2020||World||Joe Biden wins South Carolina primary, ends Bernie Sanders’ winning streak||Joe Biden scored a convincing victory in South Carolina’s Democratic primary on Saturday, riding a wave of African American support and ending progressive rival Bernie Sanders’ winning streak.The victory came at a crucial moment in Biden’s 2020 bid as the moderate Democrat bounced back from underwhelming performances in the first three contests. The race now quickly shifts toward next week’s “Super Tuesday,” when voters in 14 states award one third of the total number of presidential delegates.Biden hopes the South Carolina victory will be enough to establish him as the clear alternative to Sanders as the race moves into a new phase. Standing in Biden’s way is former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, one of the world’s richest men, who has spent more than half a billion dollars courting voters in dozens of states yet to vote.The South Carolina primary was the first major test of the candidates’ appeal among black voters. And while it gave the 77-year-old Biden a win when he most needed it, he must still prove that he has the financial and organizational resources to dramatically expand his campaign in the next 72 hours. He will also be under pressure to rely on his decades-long relationships with party leaders to create a new sense of inevitability around his candidacy.Even before news of Biden’s win was declared, Bloomberg announced his own plan to deliver a three-minute prime-time address Sunday night on two television networks. He didn’t say how much he paid for the air time, which is unprecedented in recent decades.And Sanders was already peeking ahead to Super Tuesday, betting he can amass an insurmountable delegate lead at that point. After two consecutive victories and a tie for the lead in Iowa, the 78-year-old Vermont senator’s confidence is surging.Sanders was spending the lead-up to Super Tuesday campaigning in the home states of two major Democratic rivals, betting he can score a double knockout blow — or at least limit the size of their victories.In a power play, Sanders hosted a midday rally Saturday in downtown Boston, campaigning in the heart of liberal ally Elizabeth Warren’s political turf. Addressing a crowd of thousands on the Boston Common, Sanders said his success in the Democratic primary means “the establishment is getting very nervous” — but he never predicted victory in South Carolina.On the eve of Super Tuesday, Sanders will host a concert in Minnesota, where home-state Sen. Amy Klobuchar is looking for her first win.Sanders’ senior adviser Jeff Weaver was among the staffers dispatched to California on Saturday. He said Sanders is aggressively hunting for delegates, noting that their campaign’s experience during the 2016 primary against Hillary Clinton taught them that any candidate who finishes Super Tuesday with a significant delegate advantage will be difficult to catch.“I’m confident we’re going to do very, very well across the country,” Weaver said of the coming days. He also sought to downplay the importance of South Carolina, where Biden was “expected to win.”Moments after Biden’s victory was confirmed, former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe formally endorsed the former vice president and encouraged the Democratic Party’s moderate wing to unite behind him. On CNN, he called on several candidates to get out of the race — “not after Tuesday, but tomorrow.”But the Democrats’ 2020 primary election isn’t yet a two-person race.In South Carolina, billionaire activist Tom Steyer spent more than $19 million on television advertising — more than all the other candidates combined — in his quest for his first top finish in four contests. At his state campaign headquarters on Saturday, Steyer said he felt optimistic going into the vote and was looking ahead to trips to Alabama and Texas, two Super Tuesday states.Not ceding anything, Pete Buttigieg is fighting to prove he can build a multiracial coalition. And with the help of super PACs, Warren and Klobuchar vowed to keep pushing forward no matter how they finished on Saturday.Still, Saturday was all about Biden and whether he might convince anxious establishment Democrats to rally behind him at last.Elected officials inclined to embrace his moderate politics had been reluctant to support him after bad finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire and a distant second place in Nevada last week. Yet fearing Sanders’ polarizing progressive priorities, they’re still searching for an alternative who’s viewed as a safer bet to defeat Trump in November.Senior Biden adviser Symone Sanders shifted away from calling South Carolina Biden’s “firewall” and instead called it a “springboard,” on par with how the state boosted the presidential aspirations of Barack Obama in 2008 and Clinton in 2016.That sentiment was echoed by former senior Obama adviser David Axelrod, who said a big Biden win in South Carolina could give him a Super Tuesday boost that might force several candidates to quickly consider whether to proceed, including Bloomberg.“If Biden wins by a big margin, it will translate into a bigger day for him on Tuesday,” Axelrod said. “And if he beats Bloomberg by a significant margin on Tuesday, Bloomberg is going to have to consider what he’s doing here.”Indeed, South Carolina represented much more than the fourth state on the Democrats’ months-long primary calendar.It serves as the first major test of the candidates’ strength with African American voters, who will be critical both in the general election and the rest of the primary season.African American voters in South Carolina backed Biden over any other candidate by a significant margin, according to AP VoteCast, a wide-ranging survey of the electorate. Close to half of black voters supported him, compared with 2 in 10 supporting Sanders and about the same for businessman Tom Steyer.There was also evidence that Biden’s status as former President Barack Obama’s two-term vice president helped him win over African Americans.VoteCast found that about 4 in 10 voters in South Carolina wanted to return to the politics of the past, compared to about a third in Iowa and New Hampshire. That includes the roughly 50% of African American voters who said they want a Democratic presidential nominee who would emulate the Obama’s presidency.By comparison, roughly two-thirds of white voters wanted a presidential candidate who would bring fundamental change to Washington.While voting technology was a concern in two of the last three primary contests, South Carolina uses a wide array of voting technology that presents unique challenges.Saturday’s election in South Carolina marks the first statewide test of its new fleet of electronic voting machines, a $50 million upgrade from an old and vulnerable system that lacked any paper record of individual votes. The new machines produce a paper record that can be verified by the voter and checked after the election to detect any malfunction or manipulation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-wins-south-carolina-primary-ending-bernie-sanders-winning-streak/story-fdBvkIDAShinZObxMBl4JL.html

01-03-2020||World||British PM Boris Johnson announces engagement, expecting baby with fiancée||Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his partner Carrie Symonds announced their engagement on Saturday evening, adding that they are expecting a baby in early summer, setting up Johnson to be the first prime minister to divorce and marry while in office.Johnson and his second wife, Indian-origin Marina Wheeler, are at an advanced stage of divorce. They reached a financial settlement earlier this month as a precursor to the formalisation of their divorce.Johnson, 55, and Symonds, 31, moved into Downing Street when he became prime minister in July 2019. It will be Johnson’s third marriage; he first married Allegra Mostyn-Owen in 1987; it was annulled in 1993. He then married Wheeler in 1993, with whom he had four children.In a post on her Instagram account with an image with Johnson, Symonds wrote: “Many of you already know but for my friends that still don’t, we got engaged at the end of last year... and we’ve got a baby hatching early summer. Feel incredibly blessed.”A former Conservative Party communications chief, Symonds was first romantically linked to Johnson by the media in early 2019, but her association goes back to when she worked on his successful re-election bid as London mayor in 2012.Both former prime ministers Tony Blair and David Cameron had children while in Downing Street.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pm-boris-gets-engaged-to-carrie-expecting-baby/story-B8o3h3JdYMWePOklM3evwI.html
01-03-2020||World||‘All they have to do is ask’: Trump on helping Iran with coronavirus outbreak||US President Donald Trump said Saturday he was ready to aid Iran with its outbreak of novel coronavirus if the country asked for assistance.“If we can help the Iranians with this problem, we are certainly willing to do so... All they have to do is ask. We will have great professionals over there,” Trump said at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) near Washington.The virus has now hit 61 countries across the globe, prompting the World Health Organization to raise its risk assessment to its highest level.Iran’s health ministry on Saturday reported nine new deaths, taking the total to 43.US authorities in the West Coast state of Washington meanwhile confirmed on Saturday the first fatality on American soil.Trump imposed new restrictions on anyone who has traveled in the last two weeks to Iran, and urged Americans not to visit hard-hit areas of Italy and South Korea.The US State Department said it had formally told Iran of the United States’ willingness to assist in unspecified ways through a message sent via Switzerland, which represents US interests in Tehran.The United States, which has had no diplomatic ties with Iran since 1980, pulled out of a landmark nuclear deal with the country and reimposed crippling sanctions in 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-says-ready-to-help-iran-with-coronavirus-if-asked/story-jxqleKxMoj7HcZR8LZEfzK.html
01-03-2020||World||US, Taliban sign deal to end war in Afghanistan||The US and the Taliban signed a deal on Saturday that could lead to the complete withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan over the next 14 months if the insurgents deliver on commitments not to allow the country to be used by terror groups and commence intra-Afghan negotiations.The deal was signed in the Qatari capital Doha by US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and senior Taliban leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Biradar soon after the Afghan government and the US issued a joint declaration that laid out Kabul’s readiness to participate in negotiations and conclude a ceasefire with the Taliban.India reacted cautiously to the US-Taliban deal, reiterating its policy of supporting all moves that ensure peace and stability in Afghanistan, cut ties with international terrorism, and lead to a lasting political settlement through an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled process.US secretary of state Mike Pompeo, who was present at the signing ceremony in Doha along with representatives of some 30 countries, including India, told a news conference that the US expects countries in the region, including Pakistan, to continue to “promote a peaceful and prosperous Afghanistan so that the country and region can reap the benefits of lasting peace”.The US has depended significantly on Pakistan to assist in the negotiations with the Taliban, many of whose top leaders are still based in Pakistani cities such as Karachi and Quetta. Biradar, a co-founder of the Afghan Taliban, was captured by Pakistani security agencies in Karachi in 2010 and he was released in late 2018 at the request of the US to facilitate the negotiations.The so-called “comprehensive peace agreement” between the US and the Taliban has four parts – guarantees that Afghan soil will not be used by terror groups, guarantees for the withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan, the Taliban starting intra-Afghan negotiations from March 10, and negotiations for a “permanent and comprehensive ceasefire” and a “future political road map of Afghanistan”. “The four parts are interrelated and each will be implemented in accordance with its own agreed timeframe and agreed terms. Agreement on the first two parts paves the way for the last two parts,” the agreement states.The US will cut troop strength in Afghanistan to 8,600 and ensure a proportional reduction in the forces of its allies in 135 days and subsequently all foreign forces will be withdrawn in 14 months if the Taliban delivers on its commitments. The US will also release up to 5,000 Taliban prisoners by March 10, review American sanctions and rewards on Taliban leaders to remove them by August 27, and work with members of the UN to remove the world body’s sanctions by May 29. The Taliban will have to ensure that terror groups such as al Qaeda are not based on Afghan soil or use the country for recruiting, training and fund-raising.The US-Afghanistan joint declaration, unveiled during a visit to Kabul by defence secretary Mark Esper, states the agreement with the Taliban “paves the way for intra-Afghan negotiations on a political settlement and a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire” and that “Afghanistan reaffirms its readiness to participate in such negotiations and its readiness to conclude a ceasefire with the Taliban”.However, experts believe these negotiations between multiple Afghan factions will be complicated. Moreover, the deal doesn’t set timeframes for completing the intra-Afghan negotiations or political road map and is silent on crucial matters such as women’s rights put in place since the ouster of the Taliban in 2001 and which India has insisted must be protected. Esper’s visit, officials said, was aimed at reassuring the government of President Ashraf Ghani about Washington’s commitment to Afghanistan. The deal was inked after a week-long period of “reduction in violence” by both sides. “If the Taliban uphold the agreement, the US will begin a conditions-based, and I repeat conditions-based, reduction in forces,” Esper said. He added if the Taliban did live up to commitments, the US wouldn’t hesitate to nullify the agreement. For US President Donald Trump, the deal represents a chance to deliver on his longstanding promise to bring US troops home as he begins the campaign for his re-election.“The biggest thing is that we hope the US remains committed to their promises during the negotiation and peace deal,” said Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid.For millions of Afghans, the deal represents some hope for an end to years of fighting. But security experts have called the agreement a foreign policy gamble that would give the Taliban international legitimacy. Senior members of the Afghan government and nations surrounding Afghanistan are concerned the US could abandon the country, much like it was perceived to have left the region after the Soviet Union exited Afghanistan decades ago. It is also not clear whether the Afghan government will agree to the release of 5,000 Taliban members, and whether fighters loyal to hardline splinter groups will adhere to the reduction in violence. People in the Taliban said earlier this month they were prepared to launch a spring offensive if the agreement collapses and had recruited more than 6,000 fighters and suicide bombers. The political situation in Afghanistan too continues to be fragile after the election commission recently announced Ghani won last year’s election plagued by allegations of rigging and other irregularities. Former chief executive Abdullah Abdullah rejected the results and vowed a parallel government. For India, which has extended assistance worth $3 billion to Afghanistan in the face of Pakistan’s efforts to oppose its influence in the war-torn country, the stakes are extremely high. Indian officials believe the Taliban, which has targeted Indian interests in Afghanistan, continues to act at the behest of the Pakistani military establishment.Reacting to both the deal with the Taliban and the joint declaration, external affairs ministry spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said: “India’s consistent policy is to support all opportunities that can bring peace, security and stability in Afghanistan; end violence; cut ties with international terrorism; and lead to a lasting political settlement through an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled process.”He said the entire political spectrum in Afghanistan, including the government, the democratic polity and civil society, had “welcomed the opportunity and hope for peace and stability generated by these agreements”. He added, “As a contiguous neighbour, India will continue to extend all support to the government and people of Afghanistan in realising their aspirations for a peaceful, democratic and prosperous future where the interests of all sections of Afghan society are protected.” Michael Kugelman, deputy director of the Asia Program at the Wilson Center, said that “Washington is essentially trying to show that its full strength is behind this deal and it wants to also indicate to Kabul that it’s fully behind Afghanistan as the peace and reconciliation process moves toward a formal beginning”.Former president George W Bush ordered the US-led invasion of Afghanistan in response to the 9/11 attacks in 2001. The US spent more than $750 billion and lost about 2,400 soldiers in the war.There are more than 16,500 soldiers serving under the NATO banner, of which 8,000 are American. Germany has the next largest contingent, with 1,300 troops, followed by Britain with 1,100. The US has a separate contingent of 5,000 troops deployed for counterterror missions and to provide air and ground support to Afghan forces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-taliban-sign-deal-to-end-war-in-afghanistan/story-dqKa4wdo3uxdHxCMDC4gMI.html
01-03-2020||World||First coronavirus death on US soil confirmed, Trump calls for calm||The first fatality from the novel coronavirus has been confirmed on US soil, a woman in her late 50s who was “medically high-risk,” President Donald Trump said Saturday, as he urged Americans not to panic.Health officials said the woman in Washington state was one of a handful with no known links to global hot zones to have contracted the virus -- indicating that the pathogen was now likely spreading in communities.The death occurred in King county, the most populous in the state and home to Seattle, a city of more than 700,000 people, officials in the state told AFP.The victim was not immediately identified.“It is a sad day in our state as we learn that a Washingtonian has died from COVID-19,” Washington state Governor Jay Inslee said in a statement, sending condolences to the victim’s loved ones.Speaking at a White House news conference soon after the announcement, Trump said: “She was a wonderful woman, a medically high-risk patient, in her late 50s.”“Additional cases in the United States are likely,” he continued, adding that “healthy individuals should be able to fully recover.”“Our country is prepared for any circumstance,” Trump insisted, calling on “the media and politicians and everybody else involved not to do anything to incite panic.”The Republican leader and other officials announced a more complete ban on travel from Iran, which has seen a rapid spread of the disease, and encouraged Americans to avoid travel to hard-hit areas in Italy and South Korea.Vice President Mike Pence, charged by Trump to lead efforts against the virus, said that an existing ban on travel from Iran had been expanded to include any foreign national who has visited the Islamic republic within the last 14 days.‘We will see more cases’Trump said he would meet with leaders of big pharmaceutical groups at the White House on Monday to discuss treatments and efforts to develop a vaccine to combat the virus.The president said the number of cases detected by the US public health system now stood at 22. Combined with patients who were repatriated from abroad, the overall number of infected on US soil is now about 70.“We will see more cases,” Health Secretary Alex Azar told the White House press conference.“But it’s important to remember, for the vast majority of individuals who contract the novel coronavirus, they will experience mild to moderate symptoms.”Their treatment will be to remain at home and treat the symptoms as they would the flu, he added.An American citizen died of the new coronavirus in early February at the Chinese epicenter of the global outbreak, the city of Wuhan, the US embassy confirmed at the time.Worldwide, the virus has hit 59 countries across the globe, with more than 2,900 people killed and over 85,000 infected since it was first detected at an animal market in Wuhan late last year.Authorities in Washington state set a press conference for 1:00 pm Pacific time (2100 GMT).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-coronavirus-death-on-us-soil-confirmed-trump-calls-for-calm/story-B8OIonfLBQOXfJBG0eghuO.html

There is no reason to panic at all.”France on Saturday cancelled all gatherings of 5,000 people or more in a bid to contain the coronavirus outbreak which has infected 100 people throughout the country.The virus has now hit 61 countries across the globe, with more than 2,900 people killed and nearly 86,000 infected since it was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.Its rapid spread beyond China’s borders in the past week has caused stock markets to sink to their lowest levels since the 2008 global financial crisis over fears the disease could wreak havoc on the world economy.Although the vast majority of infections have been in China, more daily cases are now logged outside the country. South Korea, Italy and Iran have emerged as major hotspots.South Korea, which has the most infected people outside China, reported its biggest surge in new cases on Saturday with 813 more patients confirmed, bringing its total to 3,150.Italy, the hotspot of the outbreak in Europe, also reported a jump in new cases on Saturday, its number of infections exceeding 1,000 and the death toll jumping by eight to 29.The virus has also spread to previously untouched areas in recent days, reaching new countries including Azerbaijan, Mexico and New Zealand, as well as the first case in sub-Saharan Africa with Nigeria reporting a case.Qatar and Ecuador both confirmed their first cases on Saturday.“We have now increased our assessment of the risk of spread and the risk of impact of COVID-19 to very high at global level,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters on Friday.European nations are scrambling to contain the outbreak -- with many cases linked to northern Italy -- including in France where a surge of new cases was confirmed Saturday.France’s latest restrictions came after 16 new cases were confirmed Saturday, bringing the country’s total to 73.Sunday’s Paris half-marathon and an agricultural symposium were among the events hit but football matches will not be cancelled. ECONOMY, EVENTS HITIn the US, the first death there was confirmed shortly as health officials urged its citizens to avoid areas hit by the outbreak.US health officials reported three more cases of the new coronavirus transmitted to people who did not travel overseas or come in contact with anyone known to be ill, indicating the disease was spreading in the country.There are now four such cases in the United States, all on the Pacific seaboard, in addition to some 60 other infections in the country.US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said the central bank was ready to intervene if needed, given the “evolving” risks to the world’s largest economy posed by the outbreak.Official data released in China on Saturday showed the extent of the damage caused to the world’s second-largest economy, with manufacturing activity falling to its lowest level on record as key industries ground to a standstill under drastic containment measures.More global events were disrupted due to the epidemic, with the United States delaying a regional summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations due in Las Vegas next month.“This is not a time for panic. It is time to be prepared -- fully prepared,” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said.- South Korean cases -South Korea’s epidemic is centred in its fourth-largest city, Daegu, whose streets have been largely deserted for days, apart from long queues at the few shops with masks for sale.Three women in the Daegu area died of the illness, taking the national toll to 17, authorities said Saturday.South Korea’s total is expected to rise further with screening of more than 210,000 members of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, a secretive entity often accused of being a cult that is linked to around half of the country’s cases.While China reported 47 more deaths on Saturday, it recorded 427 infections -- fewer new cases than South Korea -- following unprecedented quarantine efforts locking down tens of millions of people in the worst-hit cities.In Iran, unnamed health sources told the BBC that at least 210 people had died of the coronavirus -- far beyond the official death toll, but Tehran angrily denied that figure. The death toll in Iran jumped to 43 on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taken-most-aggressive-actions-to-confront-coronavirus-us-president-trump/story-jVgr4aj2qwgmPRx5sf8mTM.html

But Trump said he thought the negotiations would be successful because “everyone is tired of war.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-says-will-soon-meet-personally-with-taliban-leaders/story-NiCMDUl1PsuZAVJ8PRluyO.html
