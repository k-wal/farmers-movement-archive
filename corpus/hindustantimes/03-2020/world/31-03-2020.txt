31-03-2020||World||Covid-19: ‘All on the line’ in next 30 days, says Prez Donald Trump||More than 500 people died of the coronavirus in the United States on Monday, the single most deadly day in the battle against the outbreak, and President Donald Trump called for vigorous adherence to social-distancing guidelines over the next 30 days when the country will be “putting all on the line”.The president also sought to address concerns about the availability of essential medical supplies needed to test and treat patients and protect healthcare workers. He said the US will be in “a good shape” when the death rate is expected to peak in two weeks, specially as regards the availability of ventilators.The United States has ramped up acquisition of supplies at home, through stepped up production by American companies and purchases abroad, as complaints of shortages persisted, especially in hotspots such as New York state and city, New Jersey, Washington, and those potentially on the edge.The US coronavirus fatalities went up to 3,170, registering a jump of more than 575 over the previous day that has been the highest single-day deaths yet. The toll is also now more than the nearly 3,000 killed in the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, as was widely noted in US media.The total number of confirmed cases is more than 164,000, an increase of nearly 24,000 over Monday; and the US, which has the most cases in the world, now accounts for a fifth of global infections, which was up to 803,000. New York state remains the worst hit with 67,000 cases and 1,342 deaths, up by 377; New York City alone had 914 fatalities. New York has invited doctors and healthcare professionals from other parts of the country to help with the situation in the state, saying they will reciprocate when the time comes in other hotspots, such as Detroit and New Orleans, which are emerging as new areas of concern.“Challenging times are ahead for the next 30 days, and this is a very vital 30 days,” Trump said at a White House briefing on the outbreak, referring to the extended period of social-distancing guideline, during which the administration also expects the death-rate to peak. “We’re sort of putting it all on the line, this 30 days.”While the existing social-distancing guidelines will remain in place for this period, the administration is expected to release its strategy going forward on Tuesday, along with data and findings that have been used its top experts to warn of between 100,000 to 200,000 deaths, even if, as Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House task force, said everything was done “perfectly”.It wasn’t clear if new measures could be announced as well, but the Washington Post reported Monday the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is considering recommending people use masks when they step out. Though it’s not final yet, the CDC could require people to not to use medical masks that are in short supply, and use do-it-yourself cloth covering.The administration has stepped up acquisition and availability of supplies as complaints of shortages persist — of masks, gowns and protective gear for healthcare providers, and equipment needed for the treatment of severely ill coronavirus patients, such as ventilators.President Trump has tried to address questions about shortages at his daily briefings, especially of ventilators. “Yes, I do think so. I think we’re going to be in very good shape,” he said in response to a question if America will have enough for its people when the death-rate peaks in two weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-all-on-the-line-in-next-30-days-says-prez-donald-trump/story-NLzdVmH80m3TMz0E2N6GNP.html

They agreed to continue to discuss and take urgent actions needed to address the global challenge presented by the Covid-19 pandemic,” said a statement issued by the G20.During the March 26 meeting, G20 leaders had agreed to inject more than $5 trillion into the global economy to counter the social and economic impacts of the pandemic and to safeguard jobs and revive growth.They had also agreed to frame a joint action plan that would “outline the individual and collective actions that G20 has taken and will be taking” to respond to the pandemic and highlight the “needed medium-term measures to support the global economy during and after this phase”.The leaders had also committed themselves to addressing the “risk of debt vulnerabilities in low-income countries” to allow them to focus their efforts on fighting the pandemic, working with global organisations to swiftly deliver appropriate international financial assistance to emerging markets and developing countries, and working with the Financial Stability Board (FSB) to coordinate regulatory and supervisory measures taken by countries in response to the pandemic.The virtual meeting of G20 finance ministers also discussed the role of the IMF, World Bank and other international financial institutions to deploy all available resources and explore additional measures to support emerging markets and developing economies.They welcomed the Word Bank’s “readiness to deploy as much as $160 billion over the next 15 months to support its member countries”.The meeting of the G20 finance ministers was preceded by a meeting of trade and investment ministers on Monday, which called on the world community to step up cooperation and coordination to protect lives and lay the foundations for a strong economic recovery and sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth.“We are actively working to ensure the continued flow of vital medical supplies and equipment, critical agricultural products, and other essential goods and services across borders, for supporting the health of our citizens,” said a statement issued after the meeting of the trade ministers.The trade ministers agreed on immediate measures to facilitate trade in essential goods, including the accessibility of essential medical supplies and pharmaceuticals at affordable prices where they are most needed. They said emergency measures to tackle Covid-19 should not “create unnecessary barriers to trade or disruption to global supply chains”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-g20-finance-ministers-push-for-joint-action-plan-by-april-15/story-qnlWDJ6Ig7dU6i2wXUIYNK.html
31-03-2020||World||Coronavirus found in sputum, faeces of patients with negative Covid-19 pharyngeal swabs||Chinese doctors have found the novel coronavirus in the sputum and faecal samples of some patients with negative pharyngeal swabs for COVID-19. The study, published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, found that some patients had positive, real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results for SARS-CoV-2 in the sputum or faeces after the pharyngeal swabs became negative. Pharyngeal swabs are widely used to determine the appropriateness for a patient’s discharge from the hospital and whether isolation continues to be required, said researchers from the Capital Medical University in China. These findings raise concerns over whether patients with negative pharyngeal swabs are truly virus-free or if sampling of additional body sites might be needed. The clinicians retrospectively identified a convenience sample of patients admitted to Beijing Ditan Hospital with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and paired RT-PCR testing of pharyngeal swabs with either sputum or faeces. Among 133 patients admitted with COVID-19 from January 20 to February 27, 2020, the researchers identified 22 with an initial or follow-up positive sputum or faecal samples paired with a follow-up negative pharyngeal sample. RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV2 of sputum and faeces was seen up to 39 and 13 days, respectively, after the obtained pharyngeal samples were negative. The researchers caution that the study was not carried out in a systematic fashion with sampling of all patients in a protocolised manner, and it is not known whether these positive sputum or faecal results indicate that the patient could still be infectious to others. However, the findings are potentially important because they suggest that more study is needed in this area, the researchers said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-found-in-sputum-faeces-of-patients-with-negative-covid-19-pharyngeal-swabs/story-vmigckT0qh1zXbpCo1ySUI.html
31-03-2020||World||We have done more success in getting people to self-isolate, says Canadian PM Justin Trudeau||The Canadian Government is prepared to mobilise nearly 24,000 troops to assist in the effort to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, even as its Prime Minister Justin Trudeau pointedly said the country was on a different “trajectory” from the spread of the disease in the United States.Addressing his daily press conference, Trudeau said, “I think I would say we’re not necessarily on the same trajectory. We were quicker to get the screening done, and I think we have had more success in getting people to self-isolate.”Those remarks, delivered in French and translated by the Canadian outlet Global News, came even as cases and deaths have skyrocketed in America.However, Trudeau also admitted his Government did not get “things perfectly right” in response to a question over whether the ban on international travellers into Canada, imposed in mid-March, came a little too late.Canada witnessed a spike in cases on Monday with 1127 new patients taking the total to 7448. The country has recorded 89 deaths and 1065 have recovered.Among the actions Ottawa appears to be contemplating seriously is sending in the Armed Forces to help out the civilian authorities. Canada’s Minister of National Defence Harjit Sajjan said during a media interaction, “These flexible teams are capable of operating as local response forces to assist with humanitarian support, wellness checks, natural disaster response and other tasks as required.”He later tweeted, “We’re ready to help slow the spread of the virus, support our most vulnerable & assist provinces & territories with logistics.” Among the forces that may be marshalled will be 10 Regular Forces units consisting of 500 troops each to provide communities with “humanitarian support” and help with “delivery of goods.”Sajjan also said a wide range of helicopters and transport aircraft will be made available while the Navy is preparing to be able “to respond on short-notice to coastal communities who might need a helping hand.” Reservists and Canadian Ranger Patrols will also be called in, with the latter tasked with delivering succour to remote areas of the Arctic, inhabited by some of the country’s Indigenous communities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-have-done-more-success-in-getting-people-to-self-isolate-says-canadian-pm-justin-trudeau/story-CocbhsFBmDCdv2LOYLdEwM.html
31-03-2020||World||Canada govt receives flak for allowing pay hike for MPs amid Covid-19 outbreak||Canada’s government is getting panned for allowing a pay hike for members of Parliament to go through even as Canadians struggle with the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which, according to some estimates, may take unemployment figures in the country to 15 per cent.On April 1, members of Canada’s House of Commons and Senate will get an automatic salary increase, according to standing legislation. As a result, each MP will get at least an extra CA$ 3750.That scenario hasn’t been welcome to many include some MPs, though it hasn’t been an issue for the Trudeau Government so far. In a release, Aaron Wudrick, federal director of the Canadian Taxpayers Association, said, “I am sure all parliamentarians would agree that this is the wrong time for politicians to get a salary bump when millions of Canadians are struggling.”The view was echoed by some Opposition MPs as well. Blaine Calkins, an MP from the province of Alberta, said, in a statement, “This is a legislated pay raise that, given the current state of affairs in our country, is not only untimely but frankly, it’s in poor taste.” Along with colleague Earl Dreeshen, Calkins will donate the net raise to local charities. Huffington Post Canada reported that Opposition leader Andrew Scheer will also donate any increase to a charity “working hard to support Canadians affected by COVID-19.”It also noted that such an increase has been frozen via legislation in the past. Trudeau’s predecessor Stephen Harper did so for three years between 2010 and 2013. That came the last time a crisis of global magnitude had gripped the nation – the global economic meltdown in that case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-govt-receives-flak-for-allowing-pay-hike-for-mps-amid-covid-19-outbreak/story-iYkP7FUZLtDgzzu2Cruq1I.html
31-03-2020||World||Covid-19: Countries complain about quality of China-made equipment||A number of European countries have complained about the quality of the equipment being supplied by China to help deal with the coronavirus outbreak.Over the weekend, The Netherlands recalled thousands of masks imported from China because of quality issues, while Spain complained about defective imported test kits supplied by a Chinese manufacturer, media reports said.China’s foreign ministry said several countries had raised doubts about the quality of products imported from China, and acknowledged that there might be some problems.“A large number of Chinese manufacturers are working around the clock to help other countries save lives. Our sincerity and assistance is real. If problems occur in this process, the Chinese side will talk to relevant departments,” China’s foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a news conference on Monday. Meanwhile, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Tuesday that states across the US are “fighting” amongst themselves to source essential medical supplies as coronavirus cases in the country surge daily and “ironically” most entities are looking to buy from China.“We need supplies desperately and we’re working on that... we’re in a situation where you have 50 states all competing for supplies. The federal government is now also competing for supplies. Private hospitals are also competing for supplies. So we’ve created a situation where you literally have hundreds of entities looking to buy the same exact materials, basically from the same place which is China, ironically enough. We’re fighting amongst ourselves. We’re competing amongst ourselves,” Cuomo said at a press conference.The deadly coronavirus that first originated in Chinese city of Wuhan last last year has killed 3,305 people in the US and infected 81,518.China was emerging as a favourite possible supplier at this stage as new virus infections were slowing there and its factories were being pushed to reopen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-countries-complain-about-quality-of-chinese-made-equipment/story-w21f302vczLdoAzKHFLasJ.html
31-03-2020||World||Coronavirus has affected millions, but these countries are still free from it||The rapidly spreading coronavirus disease Covid-19 has affected more than 5,00,000 people across the world and led to the deaths of thousands. But there are still a few remote corners where the virus has not infected any person.One such place is the Palau island, nestled in the northern Pacific. It has a population of 18,000, but has still not reported a single Covid-19 positive case.A dot in the ocean hundreds of kilometres from its nearest neighbours, Palau is surrounded by the vast Pacific, which has acted as a buffer against the virus.The strict travel restrictions have also helped in keeping infections at bay for a number of nations in the region including Tonga, the Solomon Islands, the Marshall Islands and Micronesia.Also Watch | ‘Lockdown alone will not extinguish COVID-19’: WHO lists steps to fight virus The disparate group also includes Samoa, Turkmenistan, North Korea and bases on the frozen continent of Antarctica.But remoteness is not certain to stop the relentless march of the new disease. The Northern Mariana Islands (north of Palau) confirmed its first cases over the weekend, followed by a suspected death on Monday.“You can feel a rising tension and anxiety just shopping,” 28-year-old artist Klamiokl Tulop told news agency AFP. “Stores are crowded even more during non-payday weeks.”She is hopeful Palau can avoid the fate of Wuhan, New York or Madrid - where better-resourced health services were overrun.There have been several scares on Palau, including a potential case that saw one person placed into quarantine this week as authorities await test results.These scares, and the global spread of the disease, has led to an economic paralysis on the island.Supermarket aisles in the country’s largest town Koror have seen panic buying and there are shortages of hand sanitisers, masks and alcohol.The island depends heavily on goods being shipped or flown in, meaning supplies can quickly run low.United Airlines used to fly six times a week from nearby Guam - which has seen more than 50 cases - but now there is just one flight a week.Many islanders depend on tourism, but work has already dried up.Residents have been practising social distancing. Doctors are waiting for test kits to arrive from Taiwan. The government is building five isolation rooms that will be able to hold up to 14 patients.The only virus free continent today is Antarctica. There is no need for social distancing in the tundra.The groups of expeditioners present there are safe, but they do think about how their loved ones are going back home.In some places, reporting no cases does not always mean there are no cases to report.North Korea has portrayed emergency measures as an unqualified success in keeping Covid-19 out, despite sustained epidemics in neighbouring China and South Korea.But state media also appears to have doctored images to give ordinary North Koreans face masks - handing sceptics reason to believe the world’s most secretive government may not be telling the whole truth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-has-affected-millions-but-these-countries-are-still-free-from-it/story-uRFS8cgIfrqUVLyRRrYPNK.html

Most of the victims are police officers who are at the forefront to ensure the lockdowns announced to contain the spread of Sars-CoV-2 virus are successful.A 14-year-old boy became the youngest suspect in Britain to be charged with deliberately spitting or coughing at someone during the coronavirus pandemic. He was charged last week and is due to appear before a court this week.Another person, a 35-year-old man in Carlisle in Northwest England, was charged with assault after allegedly spitting at three police officers. The officers were spat at after being called out to a hostel, the BBC reported.A woman in California had claimed that she was purposely coughed on after asking a teenager to maintan social distancing in the wake of Covid-19. She narrated her ordeal on a neighbourhod watch application in the US, detailing how she was the boy pushed her and returned with a man who abused her and spat on her.Similar attacks have been reported in Australia, some of which are racial in nature. THe attackers have been arrested and charged with assault.In India too, a 40-year-old man was arrested last week for spitting on a woman and calling her ‘coronavirus’ in North Delhi’s Vijay Vihar. The woman, who faced the abuse, hails from Manipur and many social media users had termed the attack on her as racist.The police said that the incident took place on a dark stretch of road when the woman was walking past the man who was on a scooter. She was alone at the time of the incident, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spit-attack-a-worry-across-world-as-people-battle-covid-19/story-hT04QZjlD4ennN3Y0UBUII.html
31-03-2020||World||US coronavirus death toll rises past 3,000, over 1.6 lakh Covid-19 cases reported||The U.S. death toll from the coronavirus pandemic climbed past 3,000 on Monday, the deadliest day yet in the country’s mounting crisis, while New York cheered the arrival of a gleaming 1,000-bed U.S. Navy hospital ship as a sign of hope in the city’s desperate fight.In a grim new milestones marking the spread of the virus, total deaths across the United States hit 3,017, including at least 540 on Monday, and the reported cases climbed to more than 163,000, according to a Reuters tally.People in New York and New Jersey lined both sides of the Hudson River to cheer the U.S Navy ship Comfort, a converted oil tanker painted white with giant red crosses, as it sailed past the Statue of Liberty accompanied by support ships and helicopters.The Comfort will treat non-coronavirus patients, including those who require surgery and critical care, in an effort to free up other resources to fight the virus, the Navy said.“It’s a wartime atmosphere and we all have to pull together,” said New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who was among the dignitaries to greet the ship’s arrival at the Midtown Manhattan pier. Hospitals in the New York City area have been overrun with patients suffering from COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the virus. Officials have appealed for volunteer healthcare workers.“We can’t take of you if we can’t take care of ourselves,” said Krystal Horchuck, a nurse with Virtua Memorial Hospital in New Jersey. “I think a lot of us have accepted the fact that we are probably going to get this. It’s just that we want to survive. We’re all being exposed to it at some point.”The United States has the most confirmed cases in the world, a number that is likely to soar when tests for the virus become more widespread.President Donald Trump told a White House briefing that more than 1 million Americans had been tested for coronavirus - less than 3% of the population. While the United States has ramped up testing after a series of setbacks, it still lags countries like Italy and South Korea on a per capita basis.In California, another hard-hit state, Governor Gavin Newsom said the number of COVID-19 hospitalizations had nearly doubled over the past four days and the number of ICU patients had tripled. Officials there also appealed for medical volunteers. CENTRAL PARK HOSPITALSTo ease the pressure in New York, construction of a 68-bed field hospital began on Sunday in Manhattan’s Central Park. The white tents being set up evoked a wartime feel in an island of green typically used by New Yorkers to exercise, picnic and enjoy the first signs of spring.The makeshift facility, provided by the Mount Sinai Health System and non-profit organization Samaritan’s Purse, is expected to begin accepting patients on Tuesday, de Blasio said.New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, one of the most prominent public figures of the coronavirus crisis, told a news conference the state might have to step in to close playgrounds in the country’s most populous city in order to enforce social distancing and slow the spread of the virus.Cuomo and de Blasio are among a growing chorus of officials who have voiced frustration at Trump’s handling of the crisis and a shortage of ventilators and personal protective equipment.“I am not engaging the president in politics,” Cuomo, a Democrat, said of Trump, a Republican. “My only goal is to engage the president in partnership.”Ford Motor Co said on Monday it will produce 50,000 ventilators over the next 100 days at a Michigan plant in cooperation with General Electric’s healthcare unit, and can then manufacture 30,000 a month. Officials in states hard hit by the pandemic have pleaded with the Trump administration and manufacturers to speed up production of ventilators to cope with a surge in patients struggling to breathe. On Friday, Trump said he would invoke powers under the Defense Production Act to direct manufacturers to produce ventilators.CHILLING NUMBERSU.S. health officials are urging Americans to follow stay-at-home orders until the end of April to contain the spread of the virus, which originated in China and has infected about three-quarters of a million people around the world.“If we do things together well - almost perfectly - we could get in the range of 100,000 to 200,000 fatalities,” Dr. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House’s coronavirus task force, told NBC’s “Today” show.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said at a White House briefing that he expected a coronavirus outbreak in the fall, as well, but he said the nation would be better prepared to respond.Authorities in New Orleans were setting up a field hospital at the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center - the same site where thousands of Hurricane Katrina refugees gathered in 2005 - to handle an expected overflow of patients.Dr. Thomas Krajewski, an emergency room doctor at St. Barnard Parish hospital in New Orleans, said he had watched patients be admitted to the hospital and seem ready to get better only to get worse.“Many of them have passed away already in a way that ... it’s not normal,” he said. “It’s not something that any of us had prepared to do. And we’re kind of writing the book as we go.”The governors of Maryland, Virginia and Arizona issued “stay-at-home” orders as cases rose in those states, as did Washington, D.C.At the Stateville Correctional Center in Crest Hill, Illinois, 12 prisoners were hospitalized and several required ventilators, while 77 more showing symptoms were isolated at the facility, officials said.Renowned country and folk singer John Prine was among the latest celebrities - including several members of Congress - to come down with the virus. Prine was in stable condition on Monday after being hospitalized with symptoms of the illness, his wife said on Twitter. Prine, a 73-year-old cancer survivor, lives in Nashville, Tennessee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-coronavirus-death-toll-rises-past-3-000-on-deadliest-day/story-ugBNnhlppvZHNmPZ7T9ADL.html
31-03-2020||World||59,000 deaths averted so far by social distancing in EU, says study on coronavirus outbreak||Measures such as social distancing, school closures and lockdowns have ensured that at least 59,000 lives have so far been saved in 11 European countries, including the UK, according to a new study by experts at Imperial College London released on Monday.Assessing the impact of such interventions by governments, the study of the coronavirus outbreak used a new model to calculate that between 21,000 and 120,000 deaths will have been prevented up to the end of March.It said: “With current interventions remaining in place to at least the end of March, we estimate that interventions across all 11 countries will have averted 59,000 deaths up to 31 March [95% credible interval 21,000-120,000]”.“Many more deaths will be averted through ensuring that interventions remain in place until transmission drops to low levels. We estimate that, across all 11 countries between 7 and 43 million individuals have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 up to 28th March, representing between 1.88% and 11.43% of the population”.Axel Grandy, one of the authors of the study, said: “The impact of the pandemic is extreme - but it would have been much worse without the interventions. Keeping interventions in place is crucial for controlling it”.The countries assessed in the report are Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK.The study said the proportion of the population infected to date – the attack rate - is estimated to be highest in Spain followed by Italy and lowest in Germany and Norway, reflecting the relative stages of the epidemics.“Given the lag of 2-3 weeks between when transmission changes occur and when their impact can be observed in trends in mortality, for most of the countries considered here it remains too early to be certain that recent interventions have been effective”.“If interventions in countries at earlier stages of their epidemic, such as Germany or the UK, are more or less effective than they were in the countries with advanced epidemics, on which our estimates are largely based, or if interventions have improved or worsened over time, then our estimates of the reproduction number and deaths averted would change accordingly”.“It is therefore critical that the current interventions remain in place and trends in cases and deaths are closely monitored in the coming days and weeks to provide reassurance that transmission of SARS-Cov-2 is slowing”, the study added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/59-000-deaths-averted-so-far-by-social-distancing-in-eu-says-study-on-coronavirus-outbreak/story-99Gk7GOZZsPJBtTTtvEsZK.html
31-03-2020||World||Coronavirus Update: New York governor begs for help amid ‘staggering’ Covid-19 death toll||New York’s governor issued an urgent appeal for medical volunteers Monday amid a “staggering” number of deaths from the coronavirus, as he and health officials warned that the crisis unfolding in New York City is just a preview of what other communities across the U.S. could soon face.“Please come help us in New York now,” Gov. Andrew Cuomo said as the state’s death toll climbed by more than 250 in a single day to a total of more than 1,200 victims, most of them in the city. He said an additional 1 million health care workers are needed to tackle the crisis.“We’ve lost over 1,000 New Yorkers,” Cuomo said. “To me, we’re beyond staggering already. We’ve reached staggering.”Even before the governor’s appeal, close to 80,000 former nurses, doctors and other professionals in New York were stepping up to volunteer, and a Navy hospital ship, also sent to the city after 9/11, had arrived with 1,000 beds to relieve pressure on overwhelmed hospitals.“Whatever it is that they need, I’m willing to do,” said Jerry Kops, a musician and former nurse whose tour with the show Blue Man Group was abruptly halted by the outbreak.He returned to his Long Island home, where he volunteered to be a nurse again. While waiting to be reinstated, Kops has been helping at an assisted-living home near his house in Shirley, N.Y.The spike in deaths in New York was another sign of the long fight ahead against the global pandemic, which was filling Spain’s intensive care beds to capacity and shutting millions of Americans inside even as the crisis in China, where the outbreak began in December, kept easing.More than 235 million people — about two of every three Americans — live in the 33 states where governors have declared statewide orders or recommendations to stay home.In California, officials put out a similar call for medical volunteers as coronavirus hospitalizations doubled over the last four days and the number of patients in intensive care tripled.“Challenging times are ahead for the next 30 days, and this is a very vital 30 days,” President Donald Trump told reporters. “The more we dedicate ourselves today, the more quickly we will emerge on the other side of the crisis.”In Europe, meanwhile, hard-hit Italy and Spain saw their death tolls climb by more than 800 each, but the World Health Organization’s emergency chief said cases there were “potentially stabilizing.” At the same time, he warned against letting up on tough containment measures.“We have to now push the virus down, and that will not happen by itself,” Dr. Michael Ryan said.Three-quarters of a million people worldwide have become infected and more than 37,000 have died, according to a count by Johns Hopkins University.The U.S. reported more than 160,000 infections and over 2,900 deaths, with New York City the nation’s worst hot spot, but with New Orleans, Detroit and other cities also seeing alarming clusters.“Anyone who says this situation is a New York City-only situation is in a state of denial,” Cuomo said. “You see this virus move across the state. You see this virus move across the nation. There is no American who is immune to this virus.”Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. government’s top infectious-disease expert, similarly warned that smaller cities are likely about to see cases “take off” the way they have in New York City.“What we’ve learned from painful experience with this outbreak is that it goes along almost on a straight line, then a little acceleration, acceleration, then it goes way up,” he said on ABC’s “Good Morning America.”In other developments around the world:— Bells tolled in Madrid’s deserted central square and flags were lowered in a day of mourning as Spain raced to build field hospitals to treat an onslaught of patients. The death toll topped 7,300.— In Japan, officials announced a new date for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics — summer of 2021 — as a spike in reported infections fueled suspicions that the government had been understating the extent of the country’s outbreak in recent weeks while it was still hoping to salvage the Summer Games.— Moscow locked down its 12 million people as Russia braced for sweeping nationwide restrictions.— Israel said 70-year-old Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is quarantining himself after an aide tested positive for the virus. And in Britain, Prince Charles, the heir to the throne who tested positive for the virus, ended his period of isolation and is in good health, his office said.Italy’s death toll climbed to nearly 11,600. But in a bit of positive news, newly released numbers showed a continued slowdown in the rate of new confirmed cases and a record number of people recovered.“We are saving lives by staying at home, by maintaining social distance, by traveling less and by closing schools,” said Dr. Luca Richeldi, a lung specialist.At least six of Spain’s 17 regions were at their limit of intensive care unit beds, and three more were close to it, authorities said. Crews of workers were frantically building more field hospitals.Nearly 15% of all those infected in Spain, almost 13,000 people, are health care workers, hurting hospitals’ efforts to help the tsunami of people gasping for breath.In a sign of the mounting economic toll exacted by the virus in the United States, Macy’s said it would stop paying tens of thousands of employees thrown out of work when the chain closed its more than 500 department stores earlier this month.The majority of its 130,000 workers will still collect health benefits, but the company said it is switching to the “absolute minimum workforce” needed to maintain basic operations.For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. But for others, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, the virus can cause severe symptoms like pneumonia. More than 160,000 people have recovered, according to Johns Hopkins.The crisis in China, where the outbreak began in late December, continued to ease. China on Monday reported 31 new COVID-19 cases, among them just one domestic infection, and the city at the center of the disaster, Wuhan, began reopening for business as authorities lifted more of the controls that locked down tens of millions of people for two months.“I want to revenge-shop,” one excited customer declared.Japanese automaker Toyota halted production at its auto plants in Europe, but all of its factories in China resumed work Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-new-york-governor-begs-for-help-amid-staggering-covid-19-death-toll/story-Zj4HFLFPKJU9jYpDxDieQL.html

31-03-2020||World||Donald Trump defends extending coronavirus guidelines as spread continues||Siding with public health experts’ dire projections, President Donald Trump on Monday defended his decision to extend restrictive social distancing guidelines through the end of April, while bracing the nation for a coronavirus death toll that could exceed 100,000.“Challenging times are ahead for the next 30 days,” Trump said during a Rose Garden press conference. He called refraining from public outings “our shared patriotic duty” during the outbreak.The comments came a day after Trump made a dramatic course reversal and announced that he would not be moving to ease the guidelines and get the economy back up and running by Easter, as he said last week he hoped to do.In the face of stark projections from his team and searing images of overwhelmed hospitals in his native New York City, Trump instead extended to April 30 the social distancing guidelines, which had been set to expire Monday. Many states and local governments already have stiffer controls in place on mobility and gatherings.“The worst that could happen is you do it too early and all of a sudden it comes back,” Trump said during a nearly hour-long call-in interview with “Fox & Friends” as members of his coronavirus task force fanned out across other media outlets to warn the virus’ spread was only just beginning.Trump’s impulse to reopen the country, driven by pleas from business leaders, met a sober reality check from health experts, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert, who on Sunday said the U.S. could experience between 100,000-200,000 deaths and millions of infections from the pandemic.That warning hardened a recognition in Washington that the struggle against the coronavirus will not be resolved quickly even as Trump expressed a longing for normalcy.“It would not have been a good idea to pull back at a time when you really need to be pressing your foot on the pedal as opposed to on the brakes,” Fauci said Monday on CNN, describing how he and Dr. Deborah Birx, the coronavirus task force coordinator, had convinced Trump to reconsider.“We showed him the data. He looked at the data. He got it right away,” Fauci said. “It was a pretty clear picture. Dr. Debbie Birx and I went in to the Oval Office and leaned over the desk and said, ‘Here are the data. Take a look.’ He just shook his head and said, ‘I guess we got to do it.’”Americans are now being asked to prepare for at least another 30 days of severe economic and social disruption, with schools and businesses closed and public life upended. A majority of Americans remain under state or local government orders to stay at home to slow the spread of the virus, and employment claims have already skyrocketed.Trump said it was “pretty unlikely” that he would need to issue a nationwide stay-at-home order, adding he was in touch with governors on their actions.Trump spoke with the nation’s governors Monday, as did other members of his administration. Birx told the governors that it’s “several weeks away from the peak of the curve for the United States.” Trump said that modeling projected substantially more deaths if the nation did not incorporate social distancing.“I thought that was a very important study they did and it sure solved a lot of problems in my own mind and maybe in your minds,” Trump said in an audio that was obtained by The Associated Press.Republican Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland voiced appreciation for the $2.2 trillion economic stimulus bill that Trump signed into law last week and the president’s acknowledgement that states will need more help, but he also emphasized that governors are “still frustrated” about a scarcity of medical supplies.Governors also remain unsatisfied with the availability of testing kits to screen patients for the virus.Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said the U.S. had now tested more than 1 million samples for the coronavirus.But it wasn’t clear if that figure represented actual patients or samples processed. With a population of over 330 million, 1 million patients tested would represent about one-third of 1 percent of all Americans. By comparison, South Korea has tested roughly twice as many people as a percentage of its population. Still, Trump boasted testing was “at a level that no other country has reached.”Public health experts have estimated the U.S. should be testing between 100,000 and 150,000 patients daily to track and contain the virus. Azar said the U.S. is testing “nearly 100,000 samples per day.” Vice President Mike Pence said nearly three weeks ago that 4 millions tests were being distributed around the country“I can tell you that every single governor in this United States understands the importance and the fact that we are way behind the curve on test kits,” said Washington Gov. Jay Inslee.The federal guidelines that Trump elected to continue recommend against group gatherings larger than 10 and urge older people and anyone with existing health problems to stay home. People are urged to work at home when possible and avoid restaurants, bars, nonessential travel and shopping trips.For more than a week, Trump had been bombarded by calls from outside business leaders who urged him to begin reopening the nation’s economy, at least in places with low infection rates, and warned of catastrophic consequences that could damage his reelection chances if it remained shuttered for much longer.Trump told “Fox & Friends” that “nobody” was “more worried” about the economic impact on the country than he was. But he said, “We want to do something where we have the least death.”Trump, who has largely avoided talk of potential death and infection rates, cited projection models Sunday that said 2.2 million people or more could have died had social distancing measures not been put in place. And he said the country would be doing well if it “can hold” the number of deaths “down to 100,000.”In addition to the numbers, Trump said he was moved by harrowing scenes from New York, particularly hard-hit Elmhurst Hospital in his native Queens. He described the images he’d seen on television with “body bags all over, in hallways. I’ve been watching them bring in trailer trucks — freezer trucks ... because they can’t handle the bodies, there are so many of them. ... I’ve seen things that I’ve never seen before.”But experts warn that those scenes could play out across the country, as the virus spreads. Birx and Fauci said even areas that have so far been spared must prepare for the eventuality that they, too, will become hot spots, with undetected cases likely in existence now.Fauci said on ABC’s “Good Morning America” that smaller U.S. cities are now ripe for the kind of acceleration that has occurred in New York.“If you look throughout the country there are a number of smaller cities that are sort of percolating along,” Fauci said. “It looks like it’s low level, it starts to accelerate, then it goes way up.”The U.S. had more than 140,000 COVID-19 cases reported by Monday morning, with more than 2,500 deaths, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins.Most people who contract COVID-19 have mild or moderate symptoms, which can include fever and cough but also milder cases of pneumonia, sometimes requiring hospitalization. The risk of death is greater for older adults and people with other health problems. Hospitals in the most afflicted areas are straining to handle patients and some are short of critical supplies.In the “Fox & Friends” interview, Trump also said his administration was considering providing hazard pay for medical professionals who are on the front lines of the pandemic. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin agreed, telling Fox Business Network in a separate interview that the idea “makes a lot of sense” and is “definitely something we’ll put in the next bill.” Some lawmakers have said a fourth economic relief package eventually will be needed.Meanwhile, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Monday she wants the House to be ready as soon as it returns, perhaps in late April, to approve a fourth bill boosting the economy and strengthening the response to the virus. She said she wanted the package to improve broadband, bolster hospitals and state and local governments and increase direct payments to Americans.Pelosi said it should also strengthen safety requirements for first responders and medical workers and broaden workers’ leave for caring for relatives.For weeks, Trump had minimized the gravity of the pandemic, and Pelosi on Sunday accused Trump of “denial” in the crisis and called it “deadly.”Trump lashed back on Fox Monday morning.“She’s a sick puppy in my opinion,” Trump said. “I think it’s a disgrace to her country, her family”__ Associated Press writers Alan Suderman in Richmond, Virginia, Rachel La Corte in Olympia, and Darlene Superville contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-defends-extending-coronavirus-guidelines-as-spread-continues/story-adKDcRRsUx44Nymq8yJFzK.html
