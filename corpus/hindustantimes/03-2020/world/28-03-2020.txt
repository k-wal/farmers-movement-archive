28-03-2020||World||Oxford recruiting volunteers for speedy Covid-19 vaccine trial||Researchers at the University of Oxford are working “at an unprecedented rate” to make a vaccine for coronavirus available, beginning the process to screen 510 volunteers between the ages of 18 and 55 to test a new one called ChAdOx1 nCoV-19.The trial has been approved by UK regulators and ethical reviewers. Researchers are working as quickly as possible to get the vaccine ready to be used in the trial, which includes further preclinical investigations and production of a larger number of doses of the vaccine.Adrian Hill, director of the Jenner Institute at the University of Oxford, said: “The Oxford team had exceptional experience of a rapid vaccine response, such as to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014. This is an even greater challenge”.“Vaccines are being designed from scratch and progressed at an unprecedented rate. The upcoming trial will be critical for assessing the feasibility of vaccination against COVID-19 and could lead to early deployment.”The trial is a collaboration between the university’s Jenner Institute and Oxford Vaccine Group clinical teams. The vaccine is being manufactured to clinical grade standard at the Clinical Biomanufacturing Facility, the university said on Friday.The vaccine is an adenovirus vaccine vector (ChAdOx1) and was chosen as the most suitable vaccine technology for a SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) vaccine as it can generate a strong immune response from one dose. It is not a replicating virus, so it cannot cause an ongoing infection in the vaccinated individual.The university said this also makes it safer to give to children, the elderly and anyone with a pre-existing condition such as diabetes. Adenoviral vectors are a very well-studied vaccine type, having been used safely in thousands of subjects, from 1 week to 90 years of age, in vaccines targeting over 10 different diseases.“Coronaviruses have club-shaped spikes on their outer coats. Immune responses from other coronavirus studies suggest that these are a good target for a vaccine. The Oxford vaccine contains the genetic sequence of this surface spike protein inside the ChAdOx1 construct”, researchers said.“After vaccination, the surface spike protein of the coronavirus is produced, which primes the immune system to attack the coronavirus if it later infects the body”, they added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oxford-recruiting-volunteers-for-speedy-covid-19-vaccine-trial/story-KnYxEuYh2V7ej1qZGNFfOK.html
28-03-2020||World||As burglary, theft rates drop Europe’s ‘Corona criminals’ prey on panic||From trafficking dodgy surgical masks to peddling counterfeit medicines and running internet scams, criminals are finding ways to profit from the coronavirus crisis, European police warn.With billions of people under lockdown in their homes and borders shut, police chiefs say criminals are finding it hard to make money out of “traditional” activities like burglary and drug smuggling.Instead they are preying on people’s fears of the COVID-19 pandemic to sell them substandard protective goods or trick people out of their cash online, warned Europe’s police agency Europol.“Criminals are just interested in one question: ‘how can I make more money?’,” Europol director Catherine De Bolle told AFP in an interview. “This is why they are now abusing the pandemic to change their way of working.”Police around the world seized 34,000 counterfeit surgical masks in one major operation targeting so-called “corona criminals” earlier this month, Europol said in a report Friday.“Fraudsters have been very quick to adapt well-known fraud schemes to capitalise on the anxieties and fears of victims throughout the crisis,” the report added.‘Decrease in break-ins‘In many European countries, police have reported a dramatic drop in common criminal behaviour.Spanish police said there had been a roughly 50 percent drop in criminal offences compared to a year earlier since the country was put on a near total lockdown on March 14.“There is no doubt that confinement makes crime more difficult,” said the deputy director of Spain’s Guardia Civil police force, Laurentino Cena. Sweden too said it had seen burglaries drop since people were asked to work at home.Sales of street drugs have also dropped sharply in many countries since the outbreak as authorities shut borders and restrict the movement of people.But the flip side of the coin is a rise in other forms of crime trying to profit on the back of the disease.Austria’s Interior Minister Karl Nehammer said this week that “we see a decrease in breaks-ins, burglaries, but at the same time cybercrime is on the rise”.Online fraud was exploding across Europe, several agencies and police forces said.The World Health Organization, at the forefront of the fight against the pandemic, has warned of a sharp increase in email phishing and scams using its name to try to steal money and sensitive information.Britain’s National Crime Agency said criminals “target people who seek to buy medical supplies on the internet, sending emails offering fake medical support and defrauding people who may be vulnerable or increasingly isolated at home”.‘Worst in humanity’In Germany too, “cybercriminals are exploiting people’s current concerns about COVID-19 to send phishing emails with malicious content or use this fear with fraudulent intent”, police said.Fears were growing in Italy, the country worst hit by the virus, that small businesses short of money due to the crisis will turn to the mafia to save them. In Denmark, the government has promised high sentences for people who steal hydro-alcoholic gel and burglars posing as health workers of paramedics.Police have also warned people to be on the lookout for burglars wearing protective masks who claim to be carrying out coronavirus tests in order to steal from homes, particularly those of the elderly.There was also a rising threat of sexual predators who prey on young people who are spending more time in front of screens at home, officials warned.“We’ve had tips of webpages where perpetrators are discussing how the situation we are in now can be exploited,” Anna Karin Hildingson Boqvist, head of the child rights group ECPAT in Sweden, told AFP.With families confined to their homes, there are also fears of a surge in domestic violence.Some French police stations have seen a more than 30 percent increase in such reports since the country’s lockdown began on March 17, according to Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.The coronavirus outbreak is also behind a rise in anti-social behaviour.The pandemic “could bring out the worst in humanity”, Britain’s National Police Chiefs Council warned, citing the theft of oxygen cylinders at a Manchester hospital.Police in Britain and Austria have recently arrested people for coughing or spitting on people while claiming to be infected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-burglary-theft-rates-drop-europe-s-corona-criminals-prey-on-panic/story-I0FOXJjQlk6SvWXl5HnndL.html
28-03-2020||World||Another UK cabinet minister hit by coronavirus||Alister Jack, secretary of state for Scotland in the Boris Johnson government, announced on Saturday that he has developed mild symptoms for coronavirus and has gone into self-isolation.He is the second cabinet minister to be so affected after health secretary Matt Hancock and Prime Minister Johnson revealed their affliction on Friday. Chief medical officer Chris Whitty is also in self isolation.Jacks aid: “In the past 24 hours, I have developed mild symptoms associated with coronavirus. In line with medical guidance, I am self-isolating and working from home”. Officials said he has not been tested for the virus.The police have been given new powers to enforce self-isolation as the UK went through the fifth day of the three-week lockdown, but there are reports that local council workers undertaking routine work have been spat on or sworn at in parts of the UK.The Local Government Association (LGA) said there had been a number of “sickening physical and verbal assaults” on workers as it called on the public to respect the “tireless efforts” of council staff.James Jamieson, LGA chairman, said: “It is becoming increasingly concerning to hear that local government workers are being subjected to physical and verbal abuse as they try and play their part in keeping the country running through this crisis. This is unacceptable, and it has to stop”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/another-uk-cabinet-minister-hit-by-coronavirus/story-eV2TGYGU03SlqA6JY6OjnJ.html

Measures adopted by different faith groups include virtual Islamic classes; live-streaming of masses by churches; webcasts of weekly satsangs by Hindu temple, Khaleej Times reported.The Islamic Information Centre in Dubai is conducting two new courses via WhatsApp, which now has 166 attendees, said Rashid Al Junaibi, director of the centre. The centre had put all classes on hold until further notice as per the instructions by the Islamic Affairs and Charitable Activities Department.“We have also started a reading course in English and French languages via WhatsApp for over 269 of our students of 32 different nationalities to learn the book titled New Muslim Guide,” he added. “Class quizzes are conducted online via webforms.” Another community Islamic centre, Kalemah, is also conducting its weekly Islamic lectures and Arabic language classes using live broadcast app Mixlr.The St Mary’s Catholic Church in Dubai has been holding live-streaming of masses every day after places of worship temporarily shut as a precaution to prevent the spread of Covid-19.“We have dedicated priests each day who conduct online masses that are live-streamed every day at 6am, 6.45am, 12pm and 7pm. We feel good serving people and are glad we can conduct these masses online as something is better than doing nothing at all,” Rev Father Lennie Connully, parish priest at the St Mary’s Catholic Church, said. “We feel encouraged when we see their appreciation messages online thanking us for conducting masses online. Also, it is a great way of bringing the family together as during this service online they come and maybe sit around a screen,” he said.Rev Father Ninan Philip, vicar and president of St Thomas Indian Orthodox Church, said that although the gates of the church have been locked, prayers and services are being held throughout the day by the priests who reside within the church premises and special prayers are being recited for the victims of the epidemic.“We have opened up an online portal on our official website and Facebook page to live stream the mass. These have been viewed by over 25,000 members from all across the globe, all of who attended the service with absolute reverence and devotion, and are blessed to partake in the fellowship and thanksgiving from their homes,” he said.The BAPS Hindu Mandir in Abu Dhabi has been holding a webcast of weekly satsang sabha on Fridays 4pm to 5.30pm.The website of the temple stated: “In light of the current global coronavirus pandemic, to assist with the government’s efforts to contain the virus and support public health and safety, we have voluntarily suspended all assemblies at the BAPS Hindu Mandir until further notice. However, you can join our weekly prayers online at sabha.mandir.ae every Friday at 4pm. The pandemic has claimed over 27,000 lives globally and several cities around the world have been locked down to limit its spread.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/temples-churches-in-uae-hold-online-prayers-to-help-people-keep-calm-amid-coronavirus-scare/story-UPZpWizh1V1BUEFqwZiQmK.html
28-03-2020||World||British PM Johnson discusses coronavirus pandemic with Trump after diagnosis||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke to US President Donald Trump over the phone to discuss the coronavirus pandemic soon after he took to social media to announce that he has tested positive for COVID-19 and has gone into self-isolation.The 55-year-old, who is believed to be the first world leader to have tested positive for the deadly virus, said his symptoms are mild which means he will carry on leading the response to the outbreak in the UK – where the death toll jumped by 181 to hit 759 and the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 stood at 14,543 on Friday.“Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke with US President Donald Trump today. The President wished the Prime Minister a speedy recovery from coronavirus,” a Downing Street spokesperson said on Friday evening. “They agreed to work together closely, along with the G7, the G20, and other international partners, to defeat the coronavirus pandemic,” the spokesperson said.The call came soon after Prime Minister Narendra Modi sent his best wishes to Johnson on Twitter, describing him as a “fighter”.“You’re a fighter and you will overcome this challenge as well. Prayers for your good health and best wishes in ensuring a healthy UK,” said Modi.Earlier in the day, Johnson had posted an upbeat video message insisting that “we will win” against the virus if we carry on following the advice to “stay at home”.“Be in no doubt that I can continue, thanks to the wizardry of modern technology, to communicate with all my top team to lead the national fightback against coronavirus,” he said.Carrie Symonds, Johnson’s pregnant fiancée, has reportedly moved out of Downing Street and is understood to be self-isolating separately with the couple’s dog Dilyn at her south London flat.It was also confirmed on Friday that Health Secretary Matt Hancock and the Chief Medical Officer, Professor Chris Whitty, both of whom have been leading the UK government fightback and were regulars at the daily Downing Street briefings through the crisis, have also tested positive with mild symptoms.“Working from home and wishing Boris Johnson and Matt Hancock a speedy recovery,” said UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak in a Twitter post with an image of him at his desk.The Indian-origin finance minister has also been seen working in close proximity with the UK prime minister and Hancock on the government’s economic response to the crisis, most recently joining Johnson outside NO. 10 Downing Street in the “clap for carers” on Thursday night as his neighbour at No. 11.Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, stepped in to host the daily Downing Street briefing on Friday evening instead, during which he said that the government was preparing to “dramatically” roll out thousands of antigen tests for frontline National Health Service (NHS) staff.“Increasing our testing capacity is absolutely crucial in our response to and our fight against coronavirus,” said Gove.“This is a particular priority for those who work in the health and social care sector and are working so hard to keep us all safe,” he said.NHS and social care workers with symptoms or those who live with people who have symptoms will be checked – starting with critical care doctors and nurses. It follows criticism over a lack of testing for health workers. An antigen test determines if someone is currently infected and risks spreading it to others. A more effective antibody test, which confirms if someone has already had the virus and therefore immune, is still some way off with Public Health England saying that it is ordering it in the millions and will distribute it as soon as it is confident about its accuracy. The British Medical Association (BMA) said the move towards testing NHS staff in England was “long overdue”.“For every healthy member of staff at home self-isolating needlessly when they do not have the virus, the NHS is short of someone who could be providing vital care to patients on the front line,” said the BMA’s Indian-origin chairman, Dr Chaand Nagpaul.Previously, only seriously ill patients in hospital with flu-like symptoms were being routinely tested for the virus. At the moment about 6,000 people are tested daily. But by the end of March the government wants to test 10,000 people a day, rising to 25,000 by mid-April.Expert analysis suggests the rate of infection in the UK has been doubling every three to four days and the number of cases are likely to continue to increase over the next two to three weeks, before the effects of social distancing lockdown measures and restrictions on everyday life begin to have an impact.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-pm-johnson-speaks-to-trump-after-coronavirus-diagnosis/story-krh2fFoJcYbZz0Mjc7SRUK.html

28-03-2020||World||Fears of domestic violence rise as millions confined over coronavirus||With families across Europe confined to their homes to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus, fears are rising of a surge in domestic violence.From Berlin to Paris, Madrid, Rome and Bratislava, associations that help victims of domestic violence have sounded the alarm after Europe overtook China to become the epicentre of the pandemic.“For many people, their home is already not a safe place,” says the German federal association of women’s counselling centres and helplines (BFF).Also Watch | ‘Lockdown alone will not extinguish COVID-19’: WHO lists steps to fight virus But the stress caused by social isolation is exacerbating tensions and increasing “the risk of domestic and sexual violence against women and children”, the association warns.And the risks are not limited to homes where violence was already a problem before.On top of the stress caused by confinement, fears around job security and financial difficulties are also increasing the likelihood of conflicts.“It’s putting a lot of pressure on households,” says Florence Claudepierre, head of the FCPE parents’ federation in the Upper Rhine, a region hit hard by the pandemic in France.She said she is hearing stories of “parents who are cracking, who can’t carry on” in families that have not previously had any problems.In China, which is slowly emerging from several weeks of total lockdown, the women’s rights organisation Weiping has reported a threefold increase in reports of violence against women.In Spain, which has the second-worst outbreak in Europe after Italy, a 35-year-old mother of two was murdered by her partner last week.‘Where can I go?’ Elsewhere, help centres have noted a drop in calls for help -- which is not necessarily seen as a good sign either.For children, young people and women who are victims of domestic violence -- mental or physical -- the current situation means “being constantly available” for abuse by the perpetrator, the German federation stresses.Decisions to shut down schools, sports clubs and youth centres are important to curb the spread of the virus and prevent hospitals from being overrun, acknowledges Rainer Rettinger, who heads a German child protection association.But “who is seeing and hearing abused children today?” he asks.“Now violence, too, has been confined. That’s what we’re afraid of,” says Martine Brousse, head of Parisian organisation La Voix de l’Enfant (The Child’s Voice).As governments pour billions into their economies and health services, they should “not lose sight of the importance of equality and fundamental human rights,” Beatrice Fresko-Rolfo, the general rapporteur on violence against women for the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe, pointed out recently.Domestic violence associations are facing a double-edged sword: With many social workers having to work from home, they are unable to reach victims; and when people need to be brought to safety, there are often not enough places in the refuges.“Women have called us and told us they are experiencing violence at home. They are asking: Where can I go?” says Canan Gullu, from Turkey’s federation of women’s organisations.In Germany, families minister Franziska Giffey has called on municipalities to organise alternative reception facilities if necessary, while neighbouring Austria provides guaranteed places in women’s refuges or the removal of violent family members from quarantined households.In the countries with the strictest lockdowns, such as Italy, victims are exempt from some of the rules -- such as the requirement to carry a document justifying why they are leaving their home -- if they need to visit a refuge centre.“The current situation is unprecedented,” says Adriana Havasova, a psychologist from Bratislava. She hopes the confinement will be limited to two or three weeks.If it goes on for several months, “I can’t imagine how much more domestic violence could increase,” she warns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fears-of-domestic-violence-rise-as-millions-confined-over-coronavirus/story-GAhlv7Hx1TyS1gYi5DmalN.html

28-03-2020||World||Italy, Spain suffer record coronavirus deaths as infection rate surges||Italy has logged a shocking spike in its already staggering coronavirus death toll, with officials warning the peak of the crisis was still days away, as the global infection rate surges relentlessly upwards.With more than 300,000 people infected in Europe alone, the disease shows few signs of slowing, and has already cast the world into a recession, economists say.In the US, which now has more than 100,000 COVID-19 patients, President Donald Trump invoked wartime powers Friday to force a private company to make medical equipment, as the country’s overburdened healthcare system struggles to cope.“Today’s action will help ensure the quick production of ventilators that will save American lives,” Trump said as he issued the order to auto giant General Motors.With 60 percent of the country in lockdown, and infections skyrocketing, Trump also signed the largest stimulus package in US history, worth $2 trillion.It came as Italy recorded almost 1,000 deaths from the virus on Friday -- the worst one-day toll anywhere around the world since the pandemic began. One coronavirus sufferer, a cardiologist from Rome who has since recovered, recalled his hellish experience at a hospital in the capital.“The treatment for the oxygen therapy is painful, looking for the radial artery is difficult. Desperate other patients were crying out, ‘enough, enough’,” he told AFP.In one bright spot, infection rates in Italy continued their recent downward trend. But the head of the national health institute Silvio Brusaferro said the country was not out of the woods yet, predicting “we could peak in the next few days”.Spain too said its rate of new infections appeared to be slowing -- despite also reporting its deadliest day.‘Dramatic evolution’ Europe has suffered the brunt of the coronavirus crisis in recent weeks, with millions across the continent on lockdown and the streets of Paris, Rome and Madrid eerily empty.In Britain, the two men leading the country’s fight against the coronavirus -- Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Health Secretary Matt Hancock -- both announced Friday they had tested positive for COVID-19. “I am now self-isolating, but I will continue to lead the government’s response via video-conference as we fight this virus,” Johnson, who had initially resisted calls for a nationwide lockdown before changing course, wrote on Twitter. Meanwhile, other countries across the world were bracing for the virus’s full impact, with AFP tallies showing more than 26,000 deaths globally.The World Health Organization’s regional director for Africa warned the continent faced a “dramatic evolution” of the pandemic, as South Africa also began life under lockdown and reported its first virus death.In a sign of how difficult the stay-at-home order could be to enforce, police came up against hundreds of shoppers trying to force their way into a supermarket in Johannesburg on Friday, while the streets of a nearby township buzzed with people and traffic.However, two months of almost total isolation appeared to have paid off in China’s Wuhan, as the Chinese city of 11 million people where the virus first emerged partially reopened.Since January, residents have been forbidden to leave, with roadblocks installed and millions subjected to dramatic restrictions on their daily life.But on Saturday people were allowed to enter the city, and the subway network was expected to restart. Some shopping centres will open their doors next week.Younger patients In the United States, known infections jumped past 100,000, the world’s highest figure, with more than 1,500 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.In New York City, the US epicentre of the crisis, health workers battled a surging toll, including an increasing number of younger patients. “Now it’s 50-year-olds, 40-year-olds, 30-year-olds,” said one respiratory therapist. To ease the strain on virus-swamped emergency rooms in Los Angeles, a giant US naval hospital ship docked there to take patients with other conditions.In New Orleans, famed for its jazz and nightlife, health experts believe the month-long Mardi Gras in February could be largely responsible for its severe outbreak.“This is going to be the disaster that defines our generation,” said Collin Arnold, director of the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness for New Orleans.But as Europe and the United States struggle to contain the pandemic, aid groups have warned the death toll could be in the millions in low-income countries and war zones such as Syria and Yemen, where hygiene conditions are already dire and healthcare systems are in tatters.“Refugees, families displaced from their homes, and those living in crisis will be hit the hardest by this outbreak,” said the International Rescue Committee. Over 80 countries have already requested emergency aid from the International Monetary Fund, IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva said on Friday, warning massive spending will be needed to help developing nations.“It is clear that we have entered a recession” that will be worse than in 2009 following the global financial crisis, she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-spain-suffer-record-coronavirus-deaths-as-infection-rate-surges/story-Mt63TVYFQLqNRWGwes6zWK.html

It remained a print-only weekly publication, with the print version also available to subscribers online.Aziz Hanifa, the Sri Lankan-origin editor of the publication at the time of its closure, had not responded to a request for comments till the filing of this report.“India Abroad has struggled for some time (I tried to get folks to buy it!),” said S Mitra Kalita, a one-time contributor to the publication and a part of the team that founded Mint, the business paper published by HT Media Ltd, parent company of Hindustan Times. “But this leaves a huge void in coverage of South Asia and its diaspora. So now what?”India Abroad was a successful offshoot initially of rediff.com, one of the pioneering online-only Indian news websites.

28-03-2020||World||China signals ramped-up stimulus as coronavirus impact widens||China’s top leaders pledged to widen the fiscal deficit and sell sovereign debt, signaling that Beijing is preparing larger-scale stimulus to counter the economic fallout from the coronavirus.China will increase its fiscal deficit as a share of gross domestic product, issue special sovereign debt and allow local governments to sell more infrastructure bonds as part of a package to stabilize the economy, according to a Politburo meeting on Wednesday, Xinhua reported late Friday.No other details of the fiscal stimulus were given in the report. China hasn’t released its budget for 2020 because the health crisis has delayed a key political meeting. The official deficit hasn’t exceeded 3% of economic output for more than a decade.China Should Drop 3% Deficit Limit, Former PBOC Official SaysWith output crippled by factory shutdowns and transport curbs this quarter, China’s economy is now threatened further by a collapse in external demand due to the spread of the deadly disease around the world. That’s prompting a shift by policy makers who until now have stuck to a stimulus plan far more modest than those being rolled out by global counterparts.The announcement could mean “much larger fiscal deficits and local-government special bond issuance quota in 2020, and a cut to benchmark deposit rates in the near term,” economists including Lu Ting, chief China economist at Nomura International Ltd in Hong Kong wrote in a note. “Due to the unique nature of the virus-led shock and Beijing’s limited policy space, we believe Beijing will likely forgo a massive stimulus package on par with those launched during the 2008-09 and 2014-16 easing cycles.”China’s use of “special” debt at a national or local level refers to the fact that the bonds are accounted for outside the regular budgets, and are a way to target the proceeds at specific purposes like infrastructure investment.“Economic development, especially the resumption of supply chains, is facing new challenges as imported virus cases rise,” the report said, citing the meeting. “Stronger macro measures to offset the blow are needed to expand domestic demand.”The meeting also reiterated China will meet its goal of building a “moderately prosperous society” this year.China’s Economy to Grow the Slowest Since 1976 This YearIn a separate statement published late Friday, the People’s Bank of China called for better coordination of global macro policies, while re-emphasizing it will keep liquidity sufficient to help with the real economy and watch out for inflation risks.Economic activity in China collapsed in the first quarter as the government shut most of the country to counter the spread of the coronavirus. Economists have lowered their median forecast for economic growth to 2.9% for 2020, the slowest pace since 1976, when the Cultural Revolution wrecked the economy and society.The Politburo’s moves signal an escalation in China’s measured and targeted approach to stimulus, bringing it more in line with global efforts to stem the economic damage. President Donald Trump signed the largest stimulus package in U.S. history on Friday, a $2 trillion bill intended to rescue the coronavirus-battered economy.While details weren’t available, a higher deficit in general can ease local governments’ revenue stress and provide room for more tax cuts and infrastructure investment.China’s Coffers Are Depleted Just as Virus Spurs SpendingChina has issued special sovereign bonds twice before -- once in 1998 to recapitalize state banks in the wake of the Asian financial crisis and again in 2007 to set up China Investment Corp., when funds came from foreign-exchange reserves.By selling special sovereign bonds, top policy makers are opting to expand the balance sheet of the central government because it is in a relatively better fiscal situation than local authorities.The debt sales would need approval from the legislature, whose standing committee is set to meet in April.Economists at Citigroup Inc. including Liu Li-Gang wrote in a note that the announcement heralds “a big stimulus package” centered around a deficit of 3.5% of GDP and tax reductions of 2.5 trillion yuan ($352 billion), as well as special local debt boosted to 3.5 trillion yuan from 2.15 trillion yuan in 2019. Monetary policy could see cuts to market rates and further lowering of the reserve ratio.“We think that the government will have to rely on investment policy tools to buttress growth, and we see a big push in both traditional and new infrastructure investment as highly probable,” they wrote. “we are confident of an investment-led recovery in the remainder of the year.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-signals-ramped-up-stimulus-as-coronavirus-impact-widens/story-UlSwOifeWeqD3yxgu1j77K.html
28-03-2020||World||A sea of seats and just 11 flyers: airlines’ woes dwarf US aid||Miguel Diaz’s JetBlue Airways Corp. flight from New York to Orlando cost just $79 with a checked bag and was nearly empty. The 11 passengers each had a row of seats to themselves, spaced at least six feet apart to maintain high-altitude social distancing.“The entire experience was luxurious,” the 30-year-old Queens librarian said.He was one of 279,018 people who passed through security at a U.S. airport on Tuesday -- compared with 2.2 million on the same day a year ago. With the coronavirus pandemic shrinking the number of passengers, now down more than 90%, some U.S. airlines have announced plans to cut as many as eight out of 10 flights in coming months.That’s got them and their employees anticipating a $61 billion aviation aid package in the $2 trillion economic rescue bill signed Friday by President Donald Trump. The bailout is designed to avert thousands of layoffs but it won’t solve the industry’s biggest problem: A lack of passengers.Carriers have cut food and drink service with only canned or bottled water available on request in some cases. And with passenger cabins flying almost empty, airlines are turning to freight operations. American Airlines Group Inc. has started parcels-only flights for the first time in 36 years and Delta Air Lines Inc. has expanded charter freight operations.Yet the potential for months-long disruptions far outweigh what the industry faced after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.Carriers are losing money on almost every flight.“You can’t cut a plane in half,” said Michael Ball, a professor at the University of Maryland’s Robert H. Smith School of Business who specialized in aviation issues. “You cut your level of service, but you have to maintain your basic routes and your network.”The rescue plan allocates $50 billion to passenger airlines, half in loans and half in cash assistance earmarked exclusively for payroll, benefits, healthcare and other employee costs. Cargo haulers, airline contractors and airports will also be eligible for aid.There are strings attached. Airlines may have to give the government options, preferred stock or other securities in exchange for support. The aid also prohibits stock buybacks and limits executive compensation among other restrictions tailored to avoid backlash over corporate largesse that followed previous government rescues of big companies in trouble.“This is not an airline bailout. It is support to the airlines for national security reasons that the taxpayers will be compensated for,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Friday on Fox Business News. “We need to make sure when we reopen the economy we have domestic travel.”The bill calls for Mnuchin to publish application procedures for the payroll aid within five days. And the first payroll grants to airlines must go out within 10 days.The extraordinary assistance was necessary so the carriers could respond quickly after the virus and social distancing measures have run their course, American Airlines Chief Executive Officer Doug Parker told workers in a video message on Thursday.“Our elected officials want us to continue to provide safe air travel through this crisis and they want us to be up and flying when demand for travel picks up again, and that’s what we’re going to do,” he said.In exchange for the grants, airlines must maintain employment levels through September and are barred from cutting worker pay and benefits. However, many airline employees are paid hourly and will be working fewer shifts, so their checks are expected to shrink significantly.Companies also are barred from paying dividends or buying back shares through September 2021, and must cap executive compensation and termination payouts for two years.A provision of the legislation gives Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao authority to force airlines accepting aid to continue flying to destinations they served as of March 1, but it’s unclear how she may wield that power.The language stops short of requiring airlines to continue their current schedules. It merely says they have to continue flying to airports they currently serve and doesn’t say how frequently. The bill also gives Chao wide latitude, saying she can do what she deems necessary.“This is an important issue and the department supports the intent of maintaining a national network of air service to communities across the country,” the agency said in a statement. “We will have further guidance about how this will be accomplished in the days to come.”In addition to the cash infusion and loans contained in the bailout legislation, the bill contains an additional $56 million to supplement flights into small, rural airports to “prevent, prepare for, and respond to coronavirus.”“The government does not want us to shut down because we’re essential,” said Southwest Airlines Co. Chief Executive Officer Gary Kelly. “It may not be at the same number of travelers we had before, but you will certainly shut the country down if we don’t have a means to transport goods and people. So they want us to keep flying.”Airlines already are rushing to slash other costs. Executives are taking pay cuts, freezing hiring and offering voluntary unpaid leave to employees -- more than 21,000 volunteered for such offers at Delta alone.Above all, with so few passengers flying, carriers are dramatically reducing their flight schedules -- American Airlines is planning an 80% cut in flying for May, while Delta is trimming 70%. The two carriers are parking more than 1,000 aircraft. United Airlines Holdings Inc. will reduce flying 60% next month, with more cuts likely in May.Such draconian cuts are “new ground,” said Ball, the University of Maryland professor. “This can’t be a real long-term situation or something’s got to give.”The Federal Aviation Administration has taken steps to help, such as giving airlines a grace period for pilots and others to complete certain training and allowing carriers to stop flying into congested airports at which they would normally lose slots that went unused.Total Shutdown?Those tools may only go so far and the scant passenger demand means more extreme measures can’t be ruled out, according to Mike Boyd, president of aviation consultant Boyd Group International.“The package will not provide the one thing that airlines need – business,” Boyd said in a report Thursday. “Airlines are flying empty airplanes -– load factors in the teens or lower -- and this relief program is only going to extend the amount of time before the industry has to ground itself. A total or nearly-total temporary shutdown is in the cards, regardless of what Congress wants.”Airports should be preparing for a potential air service shutdown of unknown duration “that could manifest in a number of days,” he said.The industry will likely hit its low point in the second quarter before possibly beginning to rebound in the third quarter, Cowen analyst Helane Becker said via email.“If airline traffic starts to come back in mid to late June or July, we suspect the airlines will be okay. If it takes longer, then when September 30 comes along, they will start to make difficult decisions about furloughing employees until there is a need for them again,” she said.Practical ConsiderationsIn the meantime, airlines will have to wrestle with difficult choices.“We certainly do not believe they can continue to fly 5% load factors indefinitely, nor should they, but remember, pilots need to maintain a certain minimum level of flying every month or they can’t fly until they re-qualify,” she said. “As a result, while a complete shutdown for a few weeks might be advisable, it is probably impractical.”For people who continue to fly, they’ll likely have plenty of room to move about the cabin. Jaydene Benjamin, a 26-year-old South African who moved to New York as part of an au pair program, stepped off a Southwest flight to the Los Angeles suburb of Burbank on Thursday with just a handful of passengers on board.“There were people who had masks on. I didn’t wear one. I’ve heard that you shouldn’t wear one unless you were already infected,” Benjamin said. “Everyone is stressing out over coronavirus, but I was worried because I’m unemployed and have no money. I don’t like being other people’s problem.”She said she fled New York as a last resort to look for work and plans to self-quarantine for two weeks after the federal government recommended that step for everyone leaving the city earlier this week.She said there was no unusual screening when she landed.“There were police officers nearby who were announcing that anyone who sees someone who’s unwell should report it, but that was it,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-sea-of-seats-and-just-11-flyers-airlines-woes-dwarf-us-aid/story-mcRkCscf8ZMuwZiTNbM2eI.html
28-03-2020||World||Parisian opera singer belts out balcony tunes during Covid-19 lockdown||An opera singer in Paris is giving daily concerts from his balcony window to lift his neighbours’ spirits during the nationwide lockdown enforced to contain the spread of the coronavirus.Opera tenor Stephane Senechal has taken to opening his windows and belting out classic songs every day at 7 p.m., serenading neighbours forced to stay inside by the lockdown the government put in place two weeks ago.“I’m not a doctor, I’m not a hero, I’m not a hospital staff. The only thing that I know how to do is to sing, to try to bring a bit of joy,” Senechal told Reuters TV.Senechal, 43, has been doing this since the French lockdown started on March 17. He said he was looking for a way to entertain and encourage his neighbours, most of whom are elderly.On Wednesday, Senechal belted out the hit “Somewhere” from the musical “West Side Story,” dedicating it to health workers around the world on the frontline of what President Emmanuel Macron has called the “war” on the coronavirus.French health authorities reported 231 new deaths from coronavirus on Wednesday, taking the total to 1,331.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/parisian-opera-singer-belts-out-balcony-tunes-during-covid-19-lockdown/story-A3av9LQlcH6opvxGZ270dP.html
28-03-2020||World||Covid-19 update: ‘I’m sorry, some people will die’: Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro amid coronavirus outbreak||Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro on Friday cast doubt on Sao Paulo’s death toll from the coronavirus outbreak and accused the state governor of manipulating the numbers for political ends, without giving evidence for his claims.Bolsonaro’s accusations were the latest broadside in an ugly battle with Brazil’s governors, who have chafed at the president’s view that protecting the economy takes priority over social distancing measures to combat the spread of the highly contagious virus.Following the advice of public health experts, the vast majority of the country’s 26 governors have banned non-essential commercial activities and public services to contain the outbreak in their states.“I’m sorry, some people will die, they will die, that’s life,” Bolsonaro said in a television interview on Friday night. “You can’t stop a car factory because of traffic deaths.”Bolsonaro said that in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil’s economic powerhouse, the death toll seemed “too large.” Sao Paulo has the most cases and deaths so far of coronavirus in Brazil, at 1,223 cases and 68 deaths. “We need to look at what is happening there, this cannot be a numbers game to favor political interests,” Bolsonaro said.Earlier on Friday, Sao Paulo Governor Joao Doria, a former Bolsonaro ally who many expect to be a rival in the 2022 presidential election, accused Bolsonaro of promoting “disinformation” by launching a TV ad campaign criticizing the restrictions, featuring the slogan “#BrazilCannotStop.” The slogan is similar to a campaign in Milan before deaths in Italy soared. ACTION TAKENBrazil’s justice ministry on Friday barred all non-resident foreigners from entering the country via its airports. The travel ban goes into effect on Monday and follows similar measures in several other South American nations. Also on Friday, Brazil’s central bank called for emergency bond-buying powers in line with ‘quantitative easing’ policies in other countries, while unveiling a 40 billion reais credit line to help smaller companies with payroll.Economy Minister Paulo Guedes said the government will offer 45 billion reais to self-employed and informal workers, adding that all the government’s coronavirus-fighting measures will total 700 billion reais over three months.Confirmed coronavirus cases in the country jumped to 3,417 on Friday from 1,891 on Monday, as related deaths climbed to 92, according to the Health Ministry. Bolsonaro’s popularity has slipped during the crisis, and many people across Brazil bang pots and pans in their windows nightly in protest at his handling of it.In counterprotests on Friday, Bolsonaro supporters drove honking caravans through major cities to oppose the lockdowns, sharing social media videos with the #BrazilCannotStop hashtag.The TV advertisement, shared on social media by Bolsonaro allies including his son, Senator Flavio Bolsonaro, was commissioned by the president’s office at a cost of 4.9 million reais ($1 million) without consulting the Health Ministry, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.“For the neighborhood salesmen, for the shop owners in city centers, for domestic employees, for millions of Brazilians, Brazil cannot stop,” said the ad, which shows scenes of crowded classrooms and street markets. The slogan is similar to #MilanWillNotStop, which became popular in northern Italy in February. Italy went on to become a global epicenter of the outbreak, with more deaths than China.The mayor of Milan, Beppe Sala, has said he regrets sharing the hashtag. “Many have referred to that video with a hashtag #MilanWillNotStop. It was a video which went viral on the internet. Everyone was sharing it, I also shared it, rightly or wrongly, probably wrongly,” Sala said in a television interview.A Health Ministry official told reporters the ministry would not comment on Bolsonaro and that guidelines recommending social distancing remained the same.

From China, the virus spread quickly to the rest of the world, finding a new epicentre in Europe and the United States. For the first time for any country, US Covid-19 figures crossed 100,000 surpassing China’s record of over 81,000 Covid-19 cases. Here are key Covid-19 developments from across the globe. 1. The United States continues to lead with 101,657 cases followed by Italy, China and Spain.2. Covid-19 has already plunged the global economy into recession, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said on Friday.3. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, UK health secretary Matt Hancock and chief medical officer Chris Whitty test positive. 4. Death toll in Italy surged by 919 to a total of 9,134. It’s the highest number of deaths in a day.5. If the rate of growth in Covid-19 cases continues, the New York City area will suffer a more severe outbreak than those experienced in Wuhan, China or the Lombardy region of Italy, says a New York Times analysis. Death toll in New York jumped to 519, 40 per cent of US.6. A New York hospital has started sharing on ventilators, putting two patients on each.7. US President Donald Trump signed into law an unprecedented $2 trillion rescue plan Friday to salvage an economy crippled by coronavirus.8. US President Donald Trump also used for the first time war-time powers under the Defense Production Act, under increasing pressure from state governors, to force a private company, General Motors, to ramp up production of ventilators needed to treat severely ill Covid-19 patients.9. The US, France, Germany and other countries are engaged in hectic efforts to evacuate close to 14,000 of their nationals stranded in India following the suspension of commercial flights around the world due to the Covid-19 pandemic.10. Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday called on counterpart Donald Trump to take “substantive actions” to improve bilateral ties on Friday as the two countries worst hit by the rampaging Covid-19 pandemic continued to trade barbs on, among other things, the origin of the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-starts-sharing-ventilators-us-coronavirus-cases-top-100-000-top-covid-19-global-updates/story-cTzAXE1FFV3AcNg2YWEuXI.html
28-03-2020||World||US lab unveils portable 5-minute COVID-19 test for use almost anywhere||Abbott Laboratories is unveiling a coronavirus test that can tell if someone is infected in as little as 5 minutes, and is so small and portable it can be used in almost any health-care setting.The medical-device maker plans to supply 50,000 tests a day starting April 1, said John Frels, vice president of research and development at Abbott Diagnostics. The molecular test looks for fragments of the coronavirus genome, which can be detected in as little as five minutes when it’s present at high levels. A thorough search to definitively rule out an infection can take up to 13 minutes, he said.The U.S. has struggled to supply enough tests to detect the coronavirus, even as the outbreak threatens to overwhelm hospitals in New York, California, Washington and other regions. After initially restricting testing to high-risk people, and problems with a test designed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S. regulators have rushed out diagnostics made by the world’s leading commercial-testing companies.ALSO WATCH | Highest COVID-19 cases in US: Donald Trump takes a veiled jibe at China “This is really going to provide a tremendous opportunity for front-line caregivers, those having to diagnose a lot of infections, to close the gap with our testing,” Frels said. “A clinic will be able to turn that result around quickly, while the patient is waiting.”The technology builds on Illinois-based Abbott’s ID Now platform, the most common point-of-care test currently available in the U.S., with more than 18,000 units spread across the country. It is widely used to detect influenza, strep throat and respiratory syncytial virus, a common bug that causes cold-like symptoms.The test starts with taking a swab from the nose or the back of the throat, then mixing it with a chemical solution that breaks open the virus and releases its RNA. The mixture is inserted into an ID Now system, a small box weighing just under 7 pounds that has the technology to identify and amplify select sequences of the coronavirus genome and ignore contamination from other viruses.The equipment can be set up almost anywhere, but the company is working with its customers and the Trump administration to ensure the first cartridges used to perform the tests are sent to where they are most needed. They are targeting hospital emergency rooms, urgent-care clinics and doctors’ offices.Last week, Abbott’s m2000 RealTime system got U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for use in hospitals and molecular laboratories to diagnose the infection. That system can churn through more tests on a daily basis, up to 1 million a week, but it takes longer to get the results. Abbott plans to provide at least 5 million tests a month between the two systems.Other companies are also rolling out faster testing systems. Henry Schein Inc. on Thursday said its point-of-care antibody test, which looks for evidence that a person’s immune system has already fought off the infection, was available. The blood test can be given at the point of care and delivers results in about 15 minutes, though it can’t be used to definitively diagnose a current infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/abbott-launches-5-minute-covid-19-test-for-use-almost-anywhere/story-g3GF7h50RbBFVF6gbZV66J.html

Moral imperative to stop observing the bully’s sanctions,” he tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-slaps-sanctions-on-five-iran-related-firms-for-backing-terrorist-groups/story-2gXG35zO886eCJFnH4UCgI.html
28-03-2020||World||‘Help us’: After deaths on coronavirus-hit ship, guests clamor to leave||Four passengers have died on a cruise ship off the Pacific coast of Panama and more than 130 others aboard are suffering from influenza-like symptoms, at least two of whom have the coronavirus, the vessel’s operator said on Friday.Holland America Line said in a statement that the MS Zaandam, previously on a South American cruise, was trying to transit the Panama Canal and make its way to Fort Lauderdale, Florida. But Panama’s government has denied it access to the canal for sanitary reasons, leaving passengers and crew wondering when they will get home.Chris Joiner, 59, a retiree from Ottawa, Ontario, told Reuters the cruise had turned into a “nightmare.” He was worried that he and his wife, Anna, also 59, would be forced to stay aboard for an undetermined time because she had a cough, after cruise operators said they would soon transfer healthy passengers to the Zaandam’s sister ship, the Rotterdam, which is now alongside the vessel in Panamanian waters.“We’re isolated. We’re stuck on this ship. We can’t go anywhere because we’re not healthy, I guess,” said Joiner, who took a selfie in his cabin with a piece of paper on which he had written “HELP US” in a bid for attention from the media and the Canadian government.A ship official told passengers on Friday morning via a public address system that one guest had died several days ago, followed by two deaths on Thursday and another overnight, according to a recording heard by Reuters.The four dead were “older guests,” the operator said.Passengers said the announcement was the first time they had been made aware of the deaths on the 238-meter (781-foot) vessel.The Zaandam departed Argentina on March 7 and had been scheduled to end its journey in San Antonio, Chile, on March 21. Nobody has disembarked from the ship since it docked in Punta Arenas on the southern coast of Chile nearly two weeks ago.There are 1,243 guests and 586 crew on board, as well as four doctors and four nurses, the cruise operator said.Holland America is owned by Carnival Corp. Carnival’s Princess Cruises earlier this month said it was suspending voyages for two month, after two of its ocean liners that had been quarantined became hotbeds for coronavirus infections.“SITTING DUCKS”The ship official said a number of patients were tested on Thursday after the ship received virus testing kits. In another public address on Friday afternoon, also heard by Reuters, he said the situation appeared to be improving.“Some positive news, we have started to see a leveling off of guests reporting symptoms to the medical center,” the official said, adding that staff had distributed one surgical mask per person. He urged passengers to keep them clean because he did not know when more would arrive.Ian Rae, a London-based Scotsman on the ship with his wife, said most passengers were coping “pretty well” despite being in self-isolation since last Sunday.“It’s probably not an awful lot worse than the people back in the UK or anywhere else in the world at the moment,” Rae, a 73-year-old grandfather of four, told Reuters by phone.Rae, who said he and others had informed the UK government of their predicament via email, said he understood there were 229 British passengers on board. Other guests included Americans, Canadians and Australians as well as Germans, Italians, French, Spanish and New Zealanders, he said.Relatives are getting nervous.“It’s terrifying that no plan has been made for them and there are British nationals on this ship who need help,” Hayley Johnson, whose 90-year-old grandfather and 75-year-old grandmother are on board, wrote on Twitter. Johnson said she was especially worried about her grandmother, a Type 1 diabetic. All ports along the Zaandam’s South American route were closed to cruise ships, Holland America said.Some 53 guests and 85 crew have reported to the ship’s medical center with flu-like symptoms, it added.“If they can just find a port to dock it would be a huge relief. The fact they’re just sitting on board a ship, it’s like they’re sitting ducks,” said Neil Bedford, whose British parents, aged 65 and 63, are on board. Panama’s health ministry has not given permission for the ship to pass through the waterway, said Ricaurte Vasquez, the Panama Canal Authority’s administrator. Positive coronavirus tests made on board would mean putting the ship in quarantine, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/help-us-after-deaths-on-coronavirus-hit-ship-guests-clamor-to-leave/story-cDxnfFkhFBW3nFoF4wuvDP.html

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will formally step back from royal duties on March 31. It had been thought they would base themselves in Canada, where they have spent time in recent months.But The Sun said the move to California “had been planned for some time” and that the couple had “realised Canada would not work out for various reasons”.“They want to be based in the Los Angeles area,” the source told the tabloid.Meghan grew up in the Californian city and her mother, Doria Ragland, still lives there.The one-time actress also has a network of friends and work contacts in Los Angeles, where she could now restart her career.

28-03-2020||World||Grief in a pandemic: Holding a dying mother’s hand with a latex glove||Doug Briggs put on a surgical gown, blue gloves and a powered respirator with a hood. He headed into the hospital room to see his mother - to tell her goodbye.Briggs took his phone, sealed in a Ziplock bag, into the hospital room and cued up his mother’s favourite songs. He put it next to her ear and noticed her wiggle, ever so slightly, to the music.“She knew I was there,” Briggs recalled, smiling.Between songs by Barbara Streisand and the Beatles, Briggs conference-called his aunts to let them speak to their sister one last time. “I love you, and I’m sorry I’m not there with you. I hope the medicine they’re giving you is making you more comfortable,” said Meri Dreyfuss, one of her sisters.Somewhere between “Stand by Me” and “Here, There, and Everywhere,” Barbara Dreyfuss passed away – her hand in her son’s, clad in latex. It would be two days before doctors confirmed that she had succumbed to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.Dreyfuss, 75, was the eighth U.S. patient to die in a pandemic that has now killed more than 1,200 nationally and nearly 25,000 worldwide. She was among three dozen deaths linked to the Life Care nursing home in Kirkland, Washington, the site of one of the first and deadliest U.S. outbreaks. (For interactive graphics tracking coronavirus in the United States and worldwide, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2Uj9ry0 and https://tmsnrt.rs/3akNaFr )Dreyfuss’s final hours illustrate the heartrending choices now facing families who are forced to strike a balance between staying safe and comforting their sick or dying loved ones. Some have been cut off from all contact with parents or spouses who die in isolation, while others have strained to provide comfort or to say their final goodbyes through windows or over the phone.Just three days before his mother died, Briggs had been making weekend plans with her. Now, in his grief, he found himself glued to news reports and frustrated by the mixed messages and slow response from local, state and federal officials.“You find out all these things, of what they knew when,” Briggs said.Officials from Life Care Centers of America have said the facility responded the best it could to one of the worst crises ever to hit an eldercare facility, with many staffers stretched to the brink as others were sidelined with symptoms of the virus. As the first U.S. site hit with a major outbreak, the centre had few protocols for a response and little help from the outside amid national shortages of test kits and other supplies.‘NOT FEELING TOO GOOD’A flower child of the 1960’s, Dreyfuss lived a life characterized by art and activism. After marrying her high school sweetheart and giving birth to their son, she pursued a degree in women’s studies at Cal State Long Beach, where she marched for women’s equality and abortion rights.Furious over President Gerald Ford’s pardoning of former president Richard Nixon in 1974, Dreyfuss took to her typewriter and penned an angry letter to Ford. “Today is my son’s 9th birthday,” she wrote of a young Briggs. “I do not feel like celebrating.”By the time she arrived at the Life Care Center in May 2019, years of health issues had dimmed some of that spark, her son said. Fibromyalgia and plantar fasciitis restricted her to a walker or a wheelchair, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease required her to have a constant flow of oxygen.When her son visited on Feb. 25, he brought a grocery bag of her favourites, including diet A&W root beer. She awoke from a nap and smiled at him, but hinted at her discomfort.“Hi Doug,” she said. “I’m not feeling too good.”Still, Dreyfuss talked about an upcoming visit with her sisters - the movies she wanted to see, the restaurants she wanted to try. The mother and son then had only a vague awareness of the deadly virus then ravaging China.In hindsight, Briggs realized he had witnessed the first signs of her distress. His mother was using more oxygen than usual, her breathing was more strained.At the time, staff at the nursing home believed they were handling a flu outbreak and were unaware the coronavirus had started to take hold, a spokesman has said.         ‘A TINY FOOTNOTE’Two days later, Briggs dropped by to see his mom. She felt congested, and staff were going to X-ray her lungs for fluid. Briggs, 54, still saw no red flags, and continued to discuss weekend plans with his mother.“I hope we can finally watch that new Mr. Rogers movie,” she told him, referring to the film, A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood. Briggs hugged his mom before she was wheeled to the imaging room and drove for a quick meal. Soon after, he received a call from the nursing home. His mother was experiencing respiratory failure. She was on her way to the hospital. Doug rushed to nearby EvergreenHealth Medical Center. By then, she was unresponsive.At the time, there were 59 U.S. cases of coronavirus, a number that has since soared to more than 85,000.After hearing of her sister’s sudden hospitalisation, Meri Dreyfuss remembered an earlier voicemail from Barbara: her distant voice, groaning for 30 seconds. When she had first heard it, she assumed Dreyfuss had called by accident, but now she realized her sister was in pain. “It haunts me that I didn’t pick up the phone,” she said.Briggs spent close to 10 hours the next day in his mom’s hospital room. He wore a medical mask and anxiously watched her vital signs – especially the line tracking her oxygen saturation.On his way out the door, a doctor took him aside to say they were testing her for the coronavirus. He remembered the difficulty reconciling the outbreak taking place on television - far away, in China - with what was happening in his mother’s hospital room.In the Bay Area, Meri and Hillary Dreyfuss were packing their suitcases on Feb. 28 when Briggs telephoned. After the call, they decided that visiting their sister would pose too much danger of infection.“I realized there was no way we were going to get on a plane at that point, because we couldn’t see her,” said the middle sister, Hillary. “And now, it seemed that we shouldn’t be seeing Doug, either.”They cancelled their flights. On Saturday, Feb. 29, Briggs learned his mother’s condition was deteriorating. Tough decisions loomed. Briggs and his aunts decided to prioritise making her comfortable over keeping her alive. Doctors gave her morphine to relax the heaviness in her lungs.She died the next day. Having emerged from a two-week quarantine, Briggs will soon retrieve his mother’s cremated remains. The family has been struggling with how to memorialize her life in such chaotic times.“All the things that one would want to happen in the normal mourning process have been subsumed by this larger crisis,” said Hillary Dreyfuss. “It’s almost as though her death has become a tiny footnote in what’s going on.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/grief-in-a-pandemic-holding-a-dying-mother-s-hand-with-a-latex-glove/story-ozsCZwQdNU8N9I1iNNswpN.html
28-03-2020||World||US Covid-19 figures cross 100,000, a first for any country||The United States on Friday became the first country to report 100,000 confirmed coronavirus cases as President Donald Trump signed into law a $2 trillion emergency spending bill aimed at protecting average American families and businesses from economic hardships caused by the outbreak.The American president also used for the first time war-time powers under the Defense Production Act, under increasing pressure from state governors, to force a private company, General Motors, to ramp up production of ventilators needed to treat severely ill Covid-19 patients. ALSO WATCH | COVID-19 | ‘China said our soldiers brought the virus…’: Donald Trump on virus’ origin The number of confirmed coronavirus cases continued to climb aggressively, meanwhile, and crossed the 100,000- mark, a first anywhere in the world. It ended Friday at 101, 657, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker; almost 14,000 more than the next worst hit Italy (86,498). China (81,897) is in third place. The number of US death also continued to climb, to 1,581. New York state drove the surge with 527 fatalities (and 44,876 confirmed cases, also the most for any US state), bulk of which were accounted for by New York City, 366. Other states with high fatalities are Washington, New Jersey and California. Also read | Coronavirus lockdown day three roundup in key pointsThe United States had crossed 10,000 just over a week ago, on March 19. The exponential increase in the number of reported cases has raised fears that the world’s richest country could become the next epicenter of the pandemic, with a world aggregated total of 593,291; and 27,198 deaths.“We didn’t choose it but we are going to defeat it together because we’re going to work together, and this is the first start of it,” President Trump said of the public heath emergency facing the country as he signed the stimulus package bill into law, flanked by his top officials and top Republican lawmakers.The bill, which was passed by the senate earlier in the week, cleared the House with the help of parliamentary maneuverings executed jointly by Democrats, who control the chamber, and Republicans to thwart opposition from a Republican lawmaker denounced by Trump as a “grandstander”.The $2.2 trillion relief package, reported to be the largest in living memory by US media, includes direct payments to a third of Americans, ramped up unemployment benefits, and loans for small and large businesses hit by the coronavirus outbreak, It also sets aside allocations for state and city governments.Also read | US announces additional $174 million aid to 64 countries, including $ 2.9 million to India||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-covid-19-figures-cross-100-000-a-first-for-any-country/story-8NU0wdrEPcsy2NU8HhgOjJ.html
28-03-2020||World||US eyes new outbreaks as coronavirus infections worldwide top 5,90,000||New Orleans rushed to build a makeshift hospital in its convention center Friday as troubling new outbreaks bubbled in the United States, deaths surged in Italy and Spain and the world warily trudged through the pandemic that has sickened more than a half-million people.Punctuating the fact that no one is immune to the new coronavirus, it pierced even the highest echelons of global power, with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson becoming the first leader of a major country to test positive.While New York remained the worst hit city in the U.S., Americans braced for worsening conditions elsewhere, with worrisome infection numbers being reported in New Orleans, Chicago and Detroit.“We are not through this. We’re not even halfway through this,” said Joseph Kanter of the Louisiana Department of Health, which has recorded more than 2,700 cases, more than five times what it had a week ago. The United States became the first country to surpass 100,000 infections on Friday, according to a count kept by Johns Hopkins University.New Orleans’ sprawling Ernest N. Morial Convention Center, along the Mississippi River, was being converted into a massive hospital as officials prepared for thousands more patients than they could accommodate. The preparations immediately conjured images of another disaster, Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when the convention center became a squalid shelter of last resort in a city that has braved a string of storm hits, not to mention great fires and a yellow fever epidemic in centuries past.As the new health crisis loomed, economic catastrophe had already arrived in the city, where many already live in poverty and the tourism industry has screeched to a halt.“I’ve never been unemployed. But now, all of a sudden: Wop!” said John Moore, the musician best known as Deacon John, who has no gigs to perform with much of the city shut down. “It ain’t just me. It’s everybody.”In New York, where there are more than 44,000 cases statewide, the number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 passed 6,000 on Friday, double what it had been three days earlier.Gov. Andrew Cuomo called for 4,000 more temporary beds across New York City, where the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center has already been converted into a hospital.“This is going to be weeks and weeks and weeks,” Cuomo told members of the National Guard working at the Javits Center. “This is going to be a long day, and it’s going to be a hard day, and it’s going to be an ugly day, and it’s going to be a sad day.”President Donald Trump, after earlier rejecting Cuomo’s pleas for tens of thousands more ventilators, and the governor’s calls to use the Korean War-era Defense Production Act, invoked the law Friday, ordering General Motors to begin manufacturing the breathing machines.Trump signed a $2.2 trillion stimulus package, after the House approved the sweeping measure by voice vote. Lawmakers in both parties lined up behind the law to send checks to millions of Americans, boost unemployment benefits, help businesses and toss a life preserver to an overwhelmed health care system.More than 590,000 people have contracted the virus around the world and roughly 26,000 have died. While the U.S. now leads the world in infections, five countries exceed its more than 1,500 deaths: Italy, Spain, China, Iran and France.Dr. John Brooks of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned Americans remained “in the acceleration phase” of the pandemic and that all corners of the country were at risk.“There is no geographic part of the United States that is spared from this,” he said.In a phone call Friday, Chinese leader Xi Jinping told Trump that China “stands ready to provide support within its capacity,” the official Xinhua News Agency reported.Trump, who has repeatedly referred to the outbreak as a “Chinese virus,” struck a different tone Friday, tweeting after the call that “China has been through much & has developed a strong understanding of the Virus. We are working closely together. Much respect!”In Europe, Italy recorded its single biggest 24-hour rise in deaths, with 969 more victims, to bring its total number of fatalities to 9,134. The country now has more than 86,000 cases, surpassing China to record the grim distinction of the second-most infections in the world, behind the U.S.Italian President Sergio Mattarella called it “a sad page in our history.”Italian epidemiologists warn that the country’s number of cases is likely much higher than reported — perhaps by five times — although two weeks into a nationwide lockdown the daily increase seems to be slowing, at least in northern Italy.‘’It is something devastating,’’ said the Rev. Mario Carminati, whose church in the tiny Lombardy town of Seriate has been used to hold coffins of the dead before they are taken by military convoy for cremation.Spain, with the world’s fourth-biggest number of cases, reported another 7,800 infections for a total of more than 64,000. The country said health workers accounted for about 15 percent of its cases.Deaths in Spain climbed past 4,900 — the world’s second-highest total after Italy.In Britain, Johnson’s office said the prime minister was tested after showing mild symptoms for the coronavirus. He was self-isolating and continuing to lead Britain’s response to the pandemic.“Be in no doubt that I can continue, thanks to the wizardry of modern technology, to communicate with all my top team, to lead the national fightback against coronavirus,” Johnson said in a video message, adding that he had a temperature and persistent cough.Several weeks ago, Johnson had pledged he would “go on shaking hands with everybody.”British Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who has been at the forefront of the nation’s virus response, also was confirmed to be infected. Prince Charles previously said he tested positive.Around the world, the pandemic threatened people living in places with little means to respond.India launched a massive program to feed hungry day laborers after a lockdown of the country’s 1.3 billion people put them out of work. Iran’s military hurriedly finished a 2,000-bed field hospital to accommodate the worst outbreak in the Mideast. In Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, South Africa and elsewhere, the count of the infected passed 1,000 people and worries persisted that it would only get worse.For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. But for others, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, the virus can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.Johns Hopkins reported more than 130,000 people have recovered, about half in China.Stocks skidded in Europe and on Wall Street, where major indexes closed down about 3%, giving up some of the gains the market had piled up over the previous three days.The head of the International Monetary Fund said it was clear that the global economy has now entered a recession that could be as bad or worse than the 2009 downturn.___Sedensky reported from Philadelphia and Rising reported from Berlin.

Videos on social media showed overturned police vehicles and scuffles breaking out between people and cops after authorities in Jiangxi blocked entry to people travelling from Hubei, according to a Globe and Mail report. For residents of Hubei, the outbreak, which began there last year, has left them to battle a stigma despite assurances from authorities that the disease has been controlled. People are being turned away from hotels and other homes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-violence-erupts-in-china-s-hubei-as-residents-try-to-exit/story-Si3V7eLSd18eWOiM8QQyLK.html
28-03-2020||World||Coronavirus update: In UK, dogs are being trained to sniff out Covid-19||A British charity has teamed up with scientists to see whether dogs could help detect Covid-19 through their keen sense of smell, they said on Friday.Medical Detection Dogs (MDD) will work with the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) and Durham University in northeast England to determine whether canines could help diagnoses.It follows previous research into dogs’ ability to sniff out malaria and is based on a belief that each disease triggers a distinct odour.The organisations said they had begun preparations to train dogs in six weeks “to help provide a rapid, non-invasive diagnosis towards the tail end of the epidemic”.The charity has previously trained dogs to detect diseases such as cancer, Parkinson’s and bacterial infections by sniffing samples taken from patients. They can also detect subtle changes in skin temperature, potentially making them useful to determining if a person has a fever. “In principle, we’re sure that dogs could detect Covid-19,” said Claire Guest, founder and chief executive of MDD. “We are now looking into how we can safely catch the odour of the virus from patients and present it to the dogs. “The aim is that dogs will be able to screen anyone, including those who are asymptomatic, and tell us whether they need to be tested. The head of disease control at the LSHTM said dogs could detect malaria with “extremely high accuracy” and, as other respiratory diseases changed body odour, there was a “very high chance” it could also work with Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-in-uk-dogs-are-being-trained-to-sniff-out-covid-19/story-kpepxHruDptRfkCum5evuL.html
28-03-2020||World||Covid-19 update: Italy, Spain report their deadliest day of coronavirus outbreak||Italy and Spain reported their deadliest day yet since the coronavirus outbreak began even as Paris warned that hospitals will be swamped in the next 48 hours. Italy has become the second country after the US to overtake China in terms of the number of infections, recording a total of 86,498. On the same day, it recorded its single biggest spike in the number of deaths at 919.More than 300,000 cases have now been reported on the European continent.The gruesome milestones nevertheless came on the day Italian health officials said they were seeing a slight slowing down in new positive cases, two weeks into a nationwide lockdown.Italy has recorded more virus-related deaths than any other country in the world. On Friday the death toll reached 9,134.The hardest-hit northern region of Lombardy reported a steep rise in fatalities compared with the day before and remains in a critical situation, with a total of 5,402 deaths and 37,298 cases.That compared with 4,861 deaths and 34,889 cases reported up to Thursday.Spain’s health ministry on Friday reported another 769 deaths, lifting the total number of fatalities to 4,858. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez convened an emergency cabinet meeting to try to chart a way out of the crisis rapidly engulfing the nation as confirmed cases climbed to 64,059 from 56,188 on Thursday.Spain’s severely strained health service has 9,444 workers infected, a figure Amnesty International says is the highest among countries affected by the outbreak.With Italy and Spain now reporting the most deaths worldwide, Europe’s outbreak is stretching health-care systems and in some cases forcing doctors to choose who should live or die. In France, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said in a speech the government had decided to extend the country’s coronavirus lockdown by two weeks until April 15 hours after he raised the alarm over an “extremely high” surge in coronavirus cases in the country and warned things will be “difficult” in the coming days.“After these first 10 days of confinement, it is clear that we are just at the beginning of this epidemic wave. It has submerged eastern France and now it is arriving in the Paris region and northern France,” Philippe said. Futhermore, the spike in patients means hospitals in and around Paris will reach saturation point within 48 hours, the head of the French Hospital Federation warned on Friday.Paris and its suburbs now account for over a quarter of the 29,000 confirmed coronavirus infections in French hospitals, with almost 1,300 now in intensive care. “We will be at the limit of our capacities in 24 or 48 hours. We will need to show real solidarity,” Frederic Valletoux, the federation’s president told BFM TV.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-update-italy-spain-report-their-deadliest-day-of-coronavirus-outbreak/story-4ZVNapwnQ8pkNvAJBKz6ZO.html
28-03-2020||World||Covid-19 cases in US shoot past Italy and China||The US now has the highest number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the world, overtaking China and Italy, as the state of Louisiana witnessed a massive surge in infections and fatalities.The US House later on Friday passed a $2 trillion economic relief package for shielding American families and businesses from financial havoc caused by the outbreak.The coronavirus has infected more than 560,000 people worldwide, killing at least 25,400. The US now accounts for more than 15% of all the cases.Total confirmed cases stood at 86,012 in the country on Friday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Fatalities are much higher in Italy, Spain and China. But a study projects 81,000 Americans could perish in the outbreak, which, it added, was unlikely to subside before June. The study was published by experts from the University of Washington School of Medicine.In China, the national health commission on Friday reported 55 new cases, including 54 it said were imported infections. In the US, experts said cases will keep growing in the US, partly due to aggressive testing.New York could see a peak in the demand for hospital capacity in three weeks and is planning to build eight temporary hospitals to meet the surge, governor Andrew Cuomo said.Cuomo said 44,635 people have tested positive in New York, up by about 7,400 from Thursday, and that 519 New Yorkers have died from the virus, up from the previous day’s total of 385 deaths.“We are battling a deadly virus,” Cuomo said. “It’s the worst news but it’s not unexpected news either.”The other American states hit hard by Covid-19 are Louisiana, California, Washington and New Jersey. Louisiana has emerged as a new worry, reporting a massive jump in cases - by 510 over Wednesday to a total of 2,300 - and by 83 deaths. Nearly half of them were reported in New Orleans.The Canadian government, meanwhile, said it was “strongly opposed” to a US proposal to deploy troops along the international border as it could damage the traditional ties between the two countries.The White House had pitched the idea in a bid to prevent illegal border crossings into the US amid the coronavirus crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-cases-in-us-shoot-past-italy-and-china/story-uI7VpmujjOyUQ9TYDApspM.html
28-03-2020||World||Covid-19 update: US on top; coronavirus cases in 4 nations equal rest of the world this month||From around 2% of all global cases on March 1, United States, Italy, Germany and Spain together now have more than 50% of the world’s Covid-19 cases — a surge that demonstrates how the pandemic has shifted from being battle fought largely in China to one that is now heavily centred in the West.The rising cases in these four countries -- the US is now the most infected nation in the world and Italy the one with the most deaths -- are preventing a “flattening of the curve”, which has been a global goal for several weeks to curtail the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).The spread across the United States, the new epicentre of the disease, is far more uniform than it was in China, where nearly 68,000 of the total 81,800 cases were reported in the Hubei province where the disease is said to have originated. As of Friday night, 86,548 people across the US were infected, and New York alone reported 38,977 cases.On Friday, the US surpassed Italy and China in number of Covid-19 infections with a large jump in New York state that now has 50% of the country’s patients and faces a health care catastrophe with hospitals projected to run out of capacity soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-update-us-on-top-coronavirus-cases-in-4-nations-equal-rest-of-the-world-this-month/story-2e6oDxIcUpR3ITQwq1kgJI.html

28-03-2020||World||With nearly 1000 deaths in a day, Italy records its single biggest rise in Covid-19 toll||Deaths surged in Italy and Spain on Friday, troubling new outbreak sites bubbled in the United States, and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson became the first leader of a major country to test positive for the coronavirus that has sickened more than a half-million people worldwide.Italy recorded its single biggest rise in deaths, with 969 more victims, to bring its total number of fatalities to 9,134. The country now has 86,498 cases. surpassing China to record the grim distinction of the second-most infections in the world, behind the US.Johnson’s office said he was tested after showing mild symptoms for the coronavirus and is self-isolating and continuing to lead Britain’s response to the pandemic.“Be in no doubt that I can continue, thanks to the wizardry of modern technology, to communicate with all my top team, to lead the national fightback against coronavirus,” Johnson said in a video message, adding that he had a temperature and persistent cough.Several weeks ago, Johnson had pledged he would “go on shaking hands with everybody.”Johnson, 55, was the first leader of a major nation known to have contracted COVID-19; German Chancellor Angela Merkel has been in isolation since her doctor tested positive for the virus, but her first two tests have been negative.Earlier this week Britain’s Prince Charles said he had tested positive.British Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who has been at the forefront of the nation’s response to the outbreak, also was confirmed to have the virus. Britain has 11,658 confirmed cases and 578 people have died.Spain’s Health Ministry reported another 7,800 infections overnight for a total of 64,059. Deaths climbed by 769 to 4,858 — the world’s second-highest total after Italy’s 8,214 fatalities.Spain says 9,444 health workers have contracted the coronavirus. That’s nearly 15% of the total number of cases.“It’s true that we have more deaths than what we saw yesterday, but it’s also true that the percentage increase today is similar to that of he past three days and it appears there is a stabilization,” said Fernando Simón, the head of Spain’s health emergency coordination centre.In Washington, the House rushed a $2.2 trillion recovery package to President Donald Trump, approving the sweeping measure by voice vote. Lawmakers in both parties lined up behind the measure to send checks to millions of Americans, boost unemployment benefits, help businesses and toss a life preserver to an overwhelmed health care system.The situation in countries with more fragile health care infrastructure worsened, with Russia, Indonesia and South Africa all passing the 1,000-infection mark. India launched a massive program to help feed hungry day laborers after a lockdown of the country’s 1.3 billion people put them out of work.South Africa also announced its first two deaths from the virus as it began a three-week lockdown.The US now has 85,996 confirmed cases, according to a count kept by Johns Hopkins University. Italy, the U.S.. and China account for nearly half the world’s more than 550,000 infections and more than half of the roughly 25,000 reported virus deaths.Analysts warned that all those infection figures could be low for reasons that varied in each nation.“China numbers can’t be trusted because the government lies,” American political scientist Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group think-tank, said in a tweet. “US numbers can’t be trusted because the government can’t produce enough tests.”Italian epidemiologists warn that the country’s numbers are likely much higher than reported — perhaps by five times — although two weeks into a nationwide lockdown the daily increase seems to be slowing, at least in northern Italy.“It’s a horrible sensation, not being able to breathe,” said Fausto Russo, a 38-year-old fitness trainer who is one of 10,000 Italians whose infection has been cured. “Imagine putting your head under water.”For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. But for others, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, the virus can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.Johns Hopkins reported more than 127,000 people have recovered, about half in China.New York state, the epicenter of the US outbreak, reported 100 more deaths in one day, accounting for almost 30% of the 1,300 fatalities nationwide. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the number of deaths will increase soon as critically ill patients who have been on ventilators for days succumb.“That is a situation where people just deteriorate over time,” Cuomo said.The White House’s coronavirus response coordinator, Deborah Birx, said counties around Chicago and Detroit are seeing a rapid increase in cases.On Thursday, Louisiana reported the number of coronavirus cases in the state leaped 28% overnight, and New Orleans is gearing up for a possible overflow at hospitals, with plans to treat as many as 3,000 patients at the city’s convention center if necessary.Louisiana has surpassed 2,300 people known to be infected, with 86 residents dead from the COVID-19 disease caused by the virus, according to the state health department. A 17-year-old from New Orleans was among the latest deaths, the first in the state of someone under 18, and Gov. John Bel Edwards said it shows “everyone is at risk.”Washington, DC, confirmed 36 new cases, raising its total to 267. The district is under a state of emergency, its major attractions like the Smithsonian museums and National Zoo closed and White House and Capitol tours canceled. Police have blocked streets and bridges to prevent crowds from coming to see Washington’s blooming cherry blossom trees.Russian authorities ramped up testing this week after widespread criticism of insufficient screening.The stay-home order for India’s 1.3 billion people threw out of work the backbone of the nation’s economy. The government announced a $22 billion stimulus to deliver monthly rations to 800 million people.India’s massive train system was also halted, and jobless workers are now trying to walk hundreds of miles to their home villages from India’s major cities.In China, where the virus was first believed to have started, the National Health Commission on Friday reported 55 new cases, 54 of them imported infections. Once again, there were no new cases reported in Wuhan, the provincial capital where the coronavirus first emerged in December. China is barring most foreigners from entering.In a phone call Friday, Chinese leader Xi Jinping told Trump that China “understands the United States’ current predicament over the COVID-19 outbreak and stands ready to provide support within its capacity,” the official Xinhua News Agency reported.Trump, who has repeatedly referred to the outbreak as a “Chinese virus,” struck a different tone, tweeting after the call that “China has been through much & has developed a strong understanding of the Virus. We are working closely together.

Discussed in great detail the CoronaVirus that is ravaging large parts of our Planet. China has been through much & has developed a strong understanding of the Virus. We are working closely together.
