I don’t want to call it an epidemic - but it’s not far from it,” he said.The Health Ministry has asked people to refrain from any unnecessary foreign trip. Over 3,200 people have died as a result of the coronavirus worldwide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pm-netanyahu-asks-israelis-to-do-namaste-instead-of-shaking-hands-amid-coronavirus-fears/story-K8wptYhL3G8ognS2CeQlqI.html

The killings had led to changes in the federal criminal justice system to include attacks on Sikhs as a hate crime.Singh, 72, had been left paralysed by a shot in the face and could communicate only by blinking his eyes. He had lived in a long-term care facility in Milwaukee, Wisconsin since.“Babaji’s capacity for love and optimism was unchanged by the heinous attack in Oak Creek, as well as the life-altering injuries he sustained,” said his son Raghuvinder Singh said in a statement. “Even when I regularly visited him in the hospital after his paralysis, I would ask him: Are you living in chardikala, the Sikh spirit of eternal optimism? Each time, without fail, he would blink twice to say ‘yes’.”Wade Michael Page, a white supremacist, had opened fire on the gurdwara in Oak Creek, Wisconsin just as worshippers were gathering for the morning prayer. He killed six people and wounded several others - Singh was among them - before he was killed in a gunfight with a police officer.The massacre led to congressional hearings and became a turning point in the treatment of crimes against Sikhs, who had become a target of ethnic slurs, bullying and violence. The FBI now tracks incidents against Sikhs as a hate crime.Sikhs were the target of 4.1% of hate crimes committed on the basis of religious identity in 2018, according to the FBI||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2012-us-gurdwara-massacre-survivor-dies-toll-goes-up-to-7/story-gZa2zfxtLAESEhTANJjsyL.html

Born in Moscow in 1914 to a Sufi teacher and an American mother, Khan was educated in London and Paris.She worked for the Special Operations Executive in Paris during 1943. She evaded capture by the Nazis and continued to send messages to London for far longer than expected, but was betrayed, arrested and interrogated, but refused to give up secrets.Khan was executed at Dachau in September 1944; she has been described as “one of the silent heroes of the Second World War”.Besides the George Cross and the French Croix de Guerre, she has been honoured with a bust in central London and a stamp. Founded in 1866, the ‘blue plaques’ scheme celebrates links between notable figures of the past and the buildings in which they lived and worked.English Heritage said: “Her blue plaque will mark the house in Bloomsbury that was her family home when she left for France in 1943 and where her family received the news that she was missing the following year. She ultimately lost her life at the hands of the Gestapo in 1944”.Several Indians have been honoured through ‘blue plaques’ on London houses and venues with which they were associated, including Rammohun Roy, Mahatma Gandhi, Vallabhbhai Patel and B R Ambedkar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-origin-british-spy-noor-inayat-khan-to-be-honoured-with-blue-plaque/story-WmRR3MksnvkACJYsHAlG4O.html
04-03-2020||World||Mike Bloomberg drops out of US presidential race, endorses Joe Biden||Billionaire Mike Bloomberg ended his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination on Wednesday and endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden. It was a stunning collapse for the former New York City mayor, who had his 2020 hopes on the Super Tuesday states and drained more than $500 million of his own fortune into the campaign.Bloomberg announced his departure from the race after a disappointing finish on Super Tuesday in the slate of states that account for almost one-third of the total delegates available in the Democratic nominating contest. He won only the territory of American Samoa, and picked up several dozen delegates elsewhere. Biden, meanwhile, won big in Southern states where Bloomberg had poured tens of millions of dollars and even cautiously hoped for a victory.Two of his former Democratic rivals, Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg, dropped out of the race and endorsed Biden as the moderate alternative to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders just the day before Super Tuesday.Bloomberg ran an unprecedented campaign from the start. His late entrance into the race in November prompted him to skip campaigning in the first four voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. He hung his success on Super Tuesday, spending at least $180 million on advertising in those states, but had planned to continue deep into the primary calendar, already spending millions on advertising in states like Florida, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Before results poured in on Tuesday, he projected confidence while campaigning in Florida, only to have his aides say the campaign would reassess the next day.Voters ultimately rejected Bloomberg’s argument that he was the candidate best poised to take on Republican President Donald Trump. The president, for his part, had paid close attention to the Democratic nominating contest and had been especially fixated on Bloomberg. Trump regularly railed against his fellow New Yorker on Twitter, mocking his short stature by calling him “Mini Mike” and claiming Bloomberg was the candidate he wanted to run against. On Tuesday, he called the results a “complete destruction” of Bloomberg’s reputation.Bloomberg, 78, is one of the world’s richest men, worth an estimated $61 billion. His fortune flows from the financial data and media company that bears his name, which he started in the 1980s. In addition to serving 12 years as New York mayor, he endeared himself to progressive groups by pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into fighting climate change and curbing gun violence.In the early weeks of his campaign, he used his vast fortune to introduce himself to voters outside New York on his own terms, and his rivals accused him of trying to buy the party’s nomination and the White House. As voting drew closer, the former Republican was forced to confront his Democratic rivals head on by appearing alongside them on a debate stage. His first performance was shaky and uneven and caused voters to view him with a more critical eye.He proved unable to overcome consistent criticism of New York’s use of the stop-and-frisk police practice under his tenure as mayor, which disproportionately targeted young black and Latino men for searches aimed at finding weapons. The practice ended after a federal judge declared it unconstitutional, and Bloomberg apologized for using it weeks before announcing his presidential run.He similarly faced pointed criticism — primarily from rival Elizabeth Warren — about the treatment of women at his company, Bloomberg LP. Under pressure from Warren, he said in mid-February he would release three women who sued him for harassment or discrimination complaints from confidentiality agreements. Women who worked for Bloomberg were featured in a commercial praising Bloomberg’s and the company’s treatment of women, and his longtime partner Diana Taylor defended him as a champion of women.Bloomberg was dogged by accusations he was trying to buy the Democratic presidential nomination. His vast fortune proved a perfect foil for Sanders, who has said billionaires should not exist at all. Indeed, Bloomberg had a vast circle of influence from his spending on key causes like gun control as well as his philanthropic efforts to boost American cities and provide leadership training for mayors. Dozens of prominent mayors rallied behind his candidacy.That, combined with Biden’s resurgence in South Carolina and the rallying of the party’s moderate wing behind him, doomed Bloomberg’s case that he was the best candidate to take on both Sanders and Trump.What’s next for Bloomberg is unclear. He’d pledged to keep campaign offices open in key general election battleground states to help the Democrats defeat Trump even if he lost the party’s nomination. But Sanders’ campaign has said they do not want the help.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/billionaire-bloomberg-drops-out-of-us-presidential-race-endorses-joe-biden/story-Kcd49Xcl5BQK9KaeOsmIyJ.html
04-03-2020||World||Afghan Taliban reiterates plans to forge ‘bilateral relations’ with all||The Afghan Taliban has spoken of its plans to forge “bilateral relations” with countries around the world for the second time in less than a week, even though the terror group’s deal with the US doesn’t envisage a role for it in the government in Kabul.Taliban deputy leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar referred to the group’s plans to have bilateral relations during a phone conversation with US President Donald Trump on Tuesday, according to a readout from a Taliban spokesman.“Mullah Baradar further said that the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan is a strong political and military force that aims and has the potential of maintaining positive bilateral relations with you and other world countries,” Baradar was quoted as saying to Trump during the conversation that purportedly lasted 35 minutes.Trump confirmed the conversation to reporters in Washington, saying he had a “very good talk” with a Taliban leader.Taliban chief Hibatullah Akhundzada had gone a step further in a message issued on February 29, after the group signed a deal with the US that envisages the complete withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan within 14 months, and spoken of “positive bilateral relations” with regional countries.“The Islamic Emirate believes in maintaining positive bilateral relations with the world and especially with the regional countries and is committed to the principle of good neighbourly relations with its neighbours,” he had said.There was no immediate response from Indian officials to these remarks.A person familiar with developments, who declined to be identified, said: “It’s strange that the Taliban are already talking of establishing bilateral ties when they aren’t even in government. This seems to be part of their posturing.”The Taliban’s latest statements are being closely followed in diplomatic circles in New Delhi and by experts who track developments in Afghanistan.The Taliban have carried out attacks on Afghan forces at least five places across Afghanistan since they ended a partial truce, killing 16 soldiers in Kunduz province. Hours after the call between Trump and Baradar, the US carried out what it said was a “defensive strike” on the Taliban.Photos released by the Taliban showed US special representative Zalmay Khalilzad was present with the group’s leaders when they made the call to Trump from Doha in Qatar. Baradar welcomed the first contact with Trump and asked him to take “determined actions” for the withdrawal of foreign forces. He also spoke of “establishing a government of our own choosing”.Trump told reporters: “We had a good conversation. We’ve agreed there’s no violence.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-taliban-reiterates-plans-to-forge-bilateral-relations-with-all/story-8Pgr53L5OujjJXrwi8nRLN.html

The police were called to a local address on Monday following a report that a woman had been seriously injured. Pravin, 21, was pronounced dead at the scene.The police said inquiries into the circumstances surrounding the death are continuing and officers have been in the area of the incident carrying out house-to-house inquiries and collecting CCTV as they piece together the moments leading up to Pravin’s death.Detective inspector Kenny Henry said: “Our investigation into Bhavini’s tragic death is ongoing and I continue to appeal to anyone who has any information about this incident to make contact with us”.“Her family are understandably devastated by her death and we owe it to them, and Bhavini, to determine exactly what happened. Bhavini’s relatives have asked to be left alone at this difficult time to grieve and try to make sense of what has happened to their daughter.”Pravin’s family release a tribute: “As a family we could never have imagined that one day we would be issuing a tribute to Bhavini under such circumstances. Our world has been ripped apart by her death and we can’t believe she has gone”.“A light has gone out in our lives. Bhavini was a devoted daughter and sister, loved by all who knew her.

Some MPs also mentioned recent developments in Assam and Jammu and Kashmir during the debate on ‘Recent violence in India’.Adams said: “The British high commission in New Delhi and our extensive diplomatic network of deputy high commissions across India are monitoring closely the recent violence in India and developments around the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2019”.“The events in Delhi last week were very concerning, and the situation is still tense. The death of one protester is one too many. We urge restraint from all parties and trust that the Indian Government will address the concerns of people of all religions in India”.“India has a proud history of inclusive government and religious tolerance. Its secular constitution, which guarantees equality before the law, has been an exemplar of inclusive democracy. After his re-election, I note that Prime Minister Modi promised to continue this under the guiding principles of ‘together with all, development for all and trust for all’”.Conservative MP Bob Blackman noted that “Hindus have also been killed as part of the riots” and told the house that the Delhi police had organised 330 separate meetings with different communities to bring them together and calm the situation.Alison Thewliss of the Scottish National Party said many of her constituents had raised concerns over the situation in Jammu and Kashmir, and called for updating the Home Office’s assessment while dealing with cases “who have been through religious persecution already”.Adams responded: “We regularly update our advice on Kashmir via the FCO website and we encourage people to take close notice of that. I am sure that my colleagues in the Home Office will have noted the hon. Lady’s question and will make sure she gets a follow-up”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/events-in-delhi-last-week-very-concerning-uk-on-north-east-delhi-violence/story-GGjwn0OQOL5bFaUCem2E0N.html
04-03-2020||World||‘Track the infected, their close contacts’: Chinese doctors’ advice on coronavirus||Planning methodically to isolate the infected, tracking suspected cases and training healthcare workers should be key areas of focus for countries like India to control the spread of the novel coronavirus, top Chinese doctors currently working at the outbreak epicentre Wuhan said on Wednesday.Containing the outbreak is not the work of doctors alone, they said, adding that the police and transport departments should be involved in containing the virus, which until Wednesday had killed more than 3000 and infected over 93000 globally, the vast majority in China.Planning is the keyword, said Du Bin, director Medical ICU at Beijing’s Peking Union Medical College hospital.“How many cases do you have? What is the plan to cope with the disease or the patients? The laboratory-confirmed cases as well as the close contacts; where to keep the close contacts and how to identify the probable (cases) or cases within the close contacts. I do believe it is a very tough job but it has to be done,” Du said.Du said this at an interaction – along with other three frontline doctors from Wuhan – with journalists in Beijing via a video link on Wednesday afternoon.“Not only done by the health care workers but… other departments of the government have to be involved (such) as the public security, the police I mean, such as the transportation department or other departments. They have to work together. And, I think that’s the only way to control the epidemic not only in China but also in other countries,” Du said.Qiao Jie, president of Peking University’s Third hospital, said both India and China were important countries in Asia and has similarities like population and traditional family-centric activities.She said it was important to train the healthcare workers to treat covid-19 cases, adding, for example, mild and severe cases need different training.It was critical for the medics to know how to put on and then take off protective clothing, she said“Prepare the room. Use high power exhaust fans in the ward, changing (the) airflow for the patient and medical staff,” Qiao said.Training the community population, she said.“Even wearing the mask, washing hands…can isolate the disease; all very important,” she said.By the end of January, China had taken unprecedented and aggressive measures including virtually locking down the province of Hubei with a 60 million population to contain the spread of the virus.Wuhan, for example, was locked down on January 23, and remains so.The restrictions continue with hundreds of millions across China facing some kind of restrictions on their movements.The government and doctors say the results are showing as the outbreak continues to show signs of slowing in China.The Chinese mainland reported only four new confirmed cases of covid-19 on Tuesday outside Hubei Province, the epicentre of the outbreak, down from 890 on February 3, the national health commission (NHC) said.The number of people dead from the coronavirus epidemic in China is poised to cross 3000 with the death toll at reaching 2981 on Wednesday, health authorities said. By the end of Tuesday, a total of 80,270 confirmed cases of the Covid-19 had been reported on the mainland.Responding to a question on whether there’s been a turnaround in the epidemic in China, Du said designated hospitals in Wuhan are seeing an increasing number of empty beds after a large number of virus patients were discharged.Du added, however, that there’s always the possibility of another spike in new cases.Cao Bin, a doctor specialising in respiratory research in Wuhan since January, said: “The war is not over.”For a country like India, it may have only begun.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/track-the-infected-their-close-contacts-chinese-doctors-advise-on-coronavirus/story-gxjkbSxTYi1S84ir3fQlCN.html

A group of Italian tourists was placed in quarantine in India, with 17 testing positive for the virus.One bright spot has been China’s apparent progress in slowing the epidemic, with official figures on Wednesday showing new cases falling for a third straight day.More than 90,000 people have been infected and around 3,200 have died worldwide, with Iraq reporting its first death from the disease on Wednesday while dozens have died so far in neighbouring Iran.The death rate is around 3.4 percent, much higher than the seasonal flu at under one percent, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).The vast majority of cases and fatalities have been in China where tens of millions of people have been placed under quarantine, but infections are rising faster abroad now, prompting countries to discourage large gatherings and cancel a slew of events.The death toll in the United States climbed to nine, many linked to a nursing home near Seattle, while the overall number of infections shot past 100.The WHO voiced concern that masks, goggles and other protective equipment used by health workers were running out due to “rising demand, hoarding and misuse”.“We can’t stop COVID-19 without protecting our health workers,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters in Geneva, noting prices of masks have surged sixfold and the cost of ventilators has tripled.Tedros said the WHO had shipped more than half a million sets of personal protective equipment to 27 countries, but warned that “supplies are rapidly depleting”.Shortages of equipment in China caused thousands of medical workers to become infected with a dozen dying, prompting the country to step up supplies by repurposing production lines at diaper, coat and smartphone factories to make masks and hazmat suits.Panic buying At least 500 people queued up outside a supermarket in Seoul to buy masks on Wednesday, with President Moon Jae-in apologising for shortages this week.South Korea makes 10 million masks a day and the government has ordered manufacturers to supply half their output to post offices, pharmacies, and a nationwide agricultural co-operative for sale at a fixed low price, with a five-per-person limit.The virus has infected more than 5,600 people and killed 32 in South Korea, with more new daily cases there now than in China.China reported 38 more deaths on Wednesday but only 119 new cases, its lowest number since January, with most infections in central Hubei province’s capital Wuhan, where the virus was first detected in December.There have now been 2,981 deaths in China and over 80,000 cases.Indonesian police seized 600,000 face masks from a Jakarta-area warehouse after the country’s first confirmed cases of coronavirus sparked panic buying and sent prices for prevention products skyrocketing.“Mask prices have skyrocketed everywhere and there are shortages, most likely because hoarders are trying to make money at the public’s expense,” Jakarta police spokesman Yusri Yunus told AFP.Russia issued a decree Wednesday banning the export of masks, respirators and hazmat suits to ensure access to the items for medics treating coronavirus patients and the public.In Italy, a top civil protection official told AFP the country, which does not make face masks, is getting 800,000 of them from South Africa but needs at least 10 million more.Italian hospitals had initial supplies but the rapid spread of the epidemic has put the health system under strain, said Civil Protection Department director Luigi D’Angelo.French President Emmanuel Macron said Tuesday his government would requisition all face mask stocks and production in the coming months in response to the outbreak, after 2,000 masks were stolen from a hospital.A Chinese industry ministry official said Wednesday companies are encouraged to export protective gear to meet foreign demand as production now exceeds daily needs in Hubei, the epicentre of the epidemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-warns-of-mask-shortages-as-coronavirus-cases-rise-worldwide/story-8zuhjIQZHOzh0a1GPS3WKP.html

Of those outside Iran in the region, most link back to the Islamic Republic.The virus has sickened top leaders inside Iran’s civilian government and Shiite theocracy. Iran stands alone in how the virus has affected its government, even compared to hard-hit China, the epicenter of the outbreak. Worldwide, the virus has infected more than 90,000 people and caused over 3,100 deaths.Experts worry Iran may be underreporting the number of cases it has.“The virus has no wings to fly,” Jahanpour said. “We are the ones who transfer it to each other.”Iranian President Hassan Rouhani meanwhile acknowledged that the virus was in nearly all of Iran’s 31 provinces while speaking at a Cabinet meeting Wednesday.“This disease is a widespread one,” he said, according to a transcript. “It encompasses almost all of our provinces and is, in a sense, a global disease that many countries in the world have become infected with, and we must work together to tackle this problem as quickly as possible.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-says-92-dead-amid-2-922-cases-of-new-coronavirus/story-wNWJPRv6xf7yd9mJm6S7EK.html

However, the WHO also noted that the illness caused by COVID-19 is more severe than that of the flu.In a media release issued on Tuesday, WHO Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus noted, “COVID-19 spreads less efficiently than flu, and transmission does not appear to be driven by people who are not sick, while in the case of influenza, people who are infected but not yet sick are major drivers of transmission.”The WHO is relying on data compiled on the virus to obtain a clearer picture of the situation as it unfolds. The WHO chief observed, “as we get more data, we are understanding this virus, and the disease it causes, more and more.”He added, “this virus is not SARS, it’s not MERS, and it’s not influenza. It is a unique virus with unique characteristics. Both COVID-19 and influenza cause respiratory disease and spread the same way, via small droplets of fluid from the nose and mouth of someone who is sick. However, there are some important differences between COVID-19 and influenza. Some countries are looking for cases of COVID-19 using surveillance systems for influenza and other respiratory diseases.”According to evidence collected from China, which WHO observed, 1 per cent of the reported COVID-19 cases do not display symptoms, and the majority of such cases tend to develop symptoms within two days.A total of 90,893 cases of COVID-19 infections and 3110 deaths have been reported globally.As per data released by the WHO, China reported 129 cases over the past 24 hours, which is the lowest number of cases since January 20. Outside China, 1848 cases were reported from 48 countries, of which, 80 percent of cases are from just three countries - the Republic of Korea, the Islamic Republic of Iran and Italy.Meanwhile, 12 new countries have reported their first cases, and there are now 21 countries with one case reported from each country. At least 122 countries have not reported any cases. “There are not yet any vaccines or therapeutics to cure the disease. It can be contained - which is why we must do everything we can to contain it. That’s why WHO recommends a comprehensive approach,” said Ghebreyesus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-slower-than-flu-but-more-dangerous-who/story-OQcL9riSkzYr4wmdMu84JI.html

Hollywood executives are reconsidering red carpet premiers; CNN head Jeff Zucker is personally reviewing intercontinental travel.Also watch: Coronavirus: World Health Organisation asks countries to stop hoarding masksFacebook Inc is going so far as to take the “social” out of social media and has banned non-business visitors to its offices.Across the U.S. business landscape, companies from AT&T Inc to Home Depot Inc are scrambling to manage the risk of a virus that only a week ago was isolated to China, Iran, Italy and South Korea and has now spread to 53 countries. Major tech companies are pulling out of big industry events. Twitter Inc, which late Monday strongly encouraged employees to work from home, also said its Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey will no longer appear at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas later this month. By Monday evening, Facebook announced it will not attend the event.Others are cancelling their own conferences. Alphabet Inc’s Google on Monday scrapped its biggest conference for cloud computing customers, scheduled for next month in San Francisco, following the cancellation last Friday of two other events.Facebook last week shelved its annual developer conference and has also restricted travel to China, South Korea and Italy.The Menlo Park, Calif. social media giant went one step further and discouraged all gatherings of more than 50 attendees. Job candidates shouldn’t bother showing up at the office. Interviews are being rescheduled as video conferences where possible, according to one source familiar with the plans.In addition to banning travel to and from Asia and Italy, Home Depot also implemented a 14-day stay-at-home policy for employees who have returned from those regions within the past two weeks.On Wall Street, at least two major banks are testing technologies and compliance systems in preparation for employees who may be asked to work from home or off-site locations in coming weeks.In Hollywood, the coronavirus threat has already affected how films are being made and who gets to see them. Movie producers are being forced to delay film releases in China and parts of Italy where movie theaters are closed, and are looking at relocating movie shoots in areas with high numbers of coronavirus cases.ViacomCBS Inc’s Paramount Pictures postponed a three-week-long shoot in Italy for Tom Cruise’s next “Mission Impossible” film. And Walt Disney Co executives are waiting to see when theaters will reopen in China so they can release “Mulan,” an action epic about a Chinese heroine that is scheduled to hit other countries on March 27 and was expected to be the entertainment giant’s first billion-dollar box office hit of the year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/high-fives-hugs-kisses-discouraged-as-us-companies-battle-coronavirus-scare/story-PyzgEoXOxheSTTtBjPseKN.html
04-03-2020||World||Coronavirus claims three more lives in Seattle-area as outbreak spreads across US||Three more deaths from the coronavirus were reported by Washington state on Tuesday as the nation’s largest and only fatal outbreak of the respiratory disease reached beyond the Seattle area in what appeared to be the first known instance of coast-to-coast transmission.A North Carolina resident tested positive after returning from a trip to Washington state, where the individual was exposed, and apparently infected, during a visit to a nursing facility at the centre of a recent surge in cases in suburban Seattle.The total number of people diagnosed with the coronavirus in the greater Seattle area rose to 27 on Tuesday, including nine deaths, up from 18 cases and six deaths tallied on Monday, the state Department of Health reported.President Donald Trump told reporters his administration may cut off overseas travel from the United States to areas abroad with high rates of coronavirus, but said officials were not weighing any restrictions on domestic travel.A multibillion-dollar funding bill was moving slowly through Congress after Democrats raised questions about the availability of testing for the new virus.The U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates in an emergency move designed to shield the world’s largest economy from the impact of the coronavirus as Group of Seven finance officials pledged all appropriate policy moves.The North Carolina diagnosis, the first presumptive positive case announced in that state, was not part of the Seattle-area case cluster, which ranks as the largest concentration detected to date in the United States, and the only one yet to prove deadly.NURSING HOME OUTBREAKEight of those who died in Washington state were in King County and one was in neighbouring Snohomish County, officials said.“This is a very fluid, fast-moving situation as we aggressively respond to this outbreak,” said Dr. Jeff Duchin, a public health officer for Seattle and King County. Of the 27 cases documented as of Tuesday, nine of them were connected to a long-term nursing-care facility called LifeCare in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland, according to the Seattle & King County Public Health agency. Five of those who died had been LifeCare residents.The latest data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) listed 108 confirmed and presumed cases in the United States. That tally consists of 60 reported by public health authorities in 12 states plus 48 among people repatriated from abroad, most of them from an outbreak aboard the Diamond Princess cruise liner in Japan.The number of U.S. cases beyond the repatriated patients has mushroomed from just 15 reported by the CDC on Friday, as the first handful of infections believed to have emerged from community transmission were detected in the Pacific Northwest. Before that, all U.S. cases were deemed travel-related, essentially imported from abroad.In New York, a man in his 50s who lives in a New York City suburb and works at a Manhattan law firm tested positive for the virus, bringing the number of confirmed cases in that state to two, New York officials said.He has severe pneumonia and is hospitalized, officials said. The patient had not travelled to countries hardest hit in the coronavirus outbreak, which began in China in December and is now present in nearly 80 countries and territories, killing more than 3,000 people.New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said confirmation of the case was made by the city’s public health laboratory on its first day of testing. FUNDING DISPUTEPreviously, all testing was conducted by the CDC, creating a delay of several days before the result was known. U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn told Congress that testing kits should be available by the end of the week that would give labs the capacity to perform about 1 million coronavirus tests.Trump said his administration was working with Congress to pass an emergency spending measure, adding that he expected lawmakers to authorize about $8.5 billion.Senate Democrats said a dispute with Republicans over the affordability of coronavirus tests and vaccinations were holding up agreement on a funding bill. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said Vice President Mike Pence, who heads the government’s coronavirus task force, was unable to answer “vital questions” about the availability of tests during a 45-minute meeting.Stocks on Wall Street initially rose more than 2% on the Fed’s surprise statement it was cutting rates by a half percentage point to a target range of 1% to 1.25%. But the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 later all fell by nearly 3% by the end of the session.International travel to the United States will fall 6% over the next three months, the U.S. Travel Association, an industry group, forecast.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-claims-three-more-lives-in-seattle-area-as-outbreak-spreads-across-us/story-bkZanlzqNTpsnyDuuf7T7J.html
04-03-2020||World||How parents can prevent children from falling prey to coronavirus||While nations step-up preparedness against coronavirus, it is equally imperative for individuals to take preventive measures to keep the virus at bay.Children are susceptible to viral infections owing to their sensitive immune system, therefore, it is important to ensure that your young ones stay protected in the wake of the coronavirus scare. Here is what parents can do to ensure that children stay protected and what needs to be done in case symptoms arise.1. Wash your hands frequently using soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub. Follow the same for children. 2. Protective masks should be used. Mouth and nose area should be covered when coughing or sneezing.3. Dispose of the tissue into a closed bin if it has been used by a person with flu or cough. 4. Avoid close contact with anyone who has cold or flu-like symptoms.ALSO WATCH | Coronavirus: 28 positive cases in India; PM Modi to skip Holi Milan events5. Seek medical care immediately after you or your child reports having fever, cough or difficulty in breathing.Also read: Kejriwal says coronavirus to be treated as an emergency6. Keep your child’s vaccinations up to date for protection against other viruses and bacteria.7. In case you or your child show symptoms, try to avoid going to public places to prevent spread to others.8. Hands should be washed often, especially before eating; after blowing nose, coughing, or sneezing; and going to the bathroom. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. 9. While travelling, parents should follow standard hygiene measures for themselves and their children10. Clean your surroundings with a disinfecting wipe once inside an aircraft, vehicle or your accommodation.Also read: Coronavirus cases jump to 28, India to screen passengers from all nationsPregnancy, breastfeeding and coronavirusThere isn’t enough evidence supporting the transfer of the virus to the child in case of a pregnancy. According to the United Nations, the mother can continue to breastfeed, while applying all the necessary precautions “considering the benefits of breastfeeding and the insignificant role of breastmilk in the transmission of other respiratory viruses”.Symptomatic mothers should wear a mask when near a child (including during feeding) and must observe care and hygiene before and after contact with the child, UNICEF suggests in its release on coronavirus. Watch: World Health Organisation asks countries to stop hoarding masks “If a mother is too ill, she should be encouraged to express milk and give it to the child via a clean cup and/or spoon – all while following the same infection prevention methods,” the UNICEF release read. The release also states that other than symptomatic children, other kids should continue to attend school. Coronavirus has claimed over 3,000 lives worldwide. In India, the number of positive cases has jumped to 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-can-parents-prevent-children-from-falling-prey-to-coronavirus/story-XaVeveY6ltLChVnC7SE6DI.html
04-03-2020||World||United States strikes Taliban forces, in first hit since peace deal||The US conducted Wednesday its first airstrike against Taliban forces in Afghanistan, a military spokesman said, days after signing an ambitious peace deal with the militant group in the Mideastern state of Qatar.US military spokesman Col. Sonny Leggett said in a tweet that the “defensive” strike was the first US attack against the militants in 11 days. He said the attack was to counter a Taliban assault on Afghan government forces in Nahr-e Saraj in the southern Helmand province.Leggett added that Taliban forces had conducted 43 attacks on Afghan troops on Tuesday in Helmand. According to a spokesman for the province’s governor, Omer Zwak, at least two police officers were killed and one other wounded in the Washir district of southern Helmand.Leggett called on the Taliban to stop the attacks and uphold their commitments based on the agreement signed on Feb. 29 between their leaders and US peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad in Doha, Qatar, which lays out a conditions-based path to the withdrawal of American forces from Afghanistan.President Donald Trump confirmed Tuesday that he spoke on the phone to a Taliban leader, making him the first US president believed to have ever spoken directly with the militant group responsible for the deaths of thousands of US troops in nearly 19 years of fighting in Afghanistan.The Afghan Defense Ministry said in another statement on Thursday that a Taliban attack on a checkpoint in northern Kunduz province had killed seven of its soldiers.The statement said that ten Taliban fighters were killed in the shoot-out.Kandahar police spokesman Jamal Naser Barekzai told The Associated Press that a police officer was killed and one wounded in a string of Taliban attacks across the province.The Taliban have not claimed responsibility for any of these attacks so far or commented on the US airstrike Wednesday.However, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told the AP Wednesday that a week of reduction in violence that started midnight on Feb. 21 had ended.Based on the US -Taliban deal, peace negotiations between the warring Afghan sides are supposed to begin on March 10. However, the Afghan government has already rejected releasing Taliban prisoners ahead of launching the talks, a precondition which the militants say was part of the US agreement.Leggett said that US forces are responsible for defending their Afghan allies according to agreements between US and Afghan governments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-hits-taliban-with-air-strike-american-military-spokesperson/story-153Vufzcctkn7mjhCRoxmM.html
04-03-2020||World||Former US vice-president Biden rides ‘Joementum’ to win 8 of 14 Super Tuesday contests||Former Vice-President Joe Biden had won or projected to win nine of the 14 states that voted in the Super Tuesday Democratic nominating contests, in a stunning comeback that started last week South Carolina and is propelled by, what his supporters are calling “Joementum”, built in part on continuing coalescence of moderates in the party around his candidacy.Senator Bernie Sanders, the frontrunner before the Super Tuesday contests picked up, or projected to, three states, including the biggest catch of the night California in terms of delegates, who will elect the nominee at the party’s presidential convention in Milwaukee in Wisconsin state.“It’s good night, it’s a good night,” an elated Biden told supporters at a campaign event in California, reminding them of pundits and experts declaring his candidacy dead. “We are very much alive, make no mistake about it — this campaign will send Donald Trump packing.”Sanders also sounded optimistic at a rally in Vermont, his home state, where he pitched his campaign as the one that could potentially beat Trump and not his rivals, drawing stark contrast between himself and them on politics and campaign funding and key issues such as healthcare, trade deals.Senator Elizabeth Warren did not win any state, not even her home-state of Massachusetts. In fact, she finished third there. Billionaire and former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg had win in the US territory of American Samoa to show for the millions he has spent on his campaign. He is said to be weighing his options now. Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, the fifth candidate in the fray, barely registered her presence. Biden started the night with a massive victory in Virginia, a key swing state that plays a crucial role in presidential elections, and went on to win North Carolina, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Tennessee, Minnesota, Massachusetts, Alabama and the prize state of Texas. He also led in Maine, but it had not been called.Sanders picked up home state Vermont, Utah, Colorado and, according to projections, California.This race is more than about winning states. Unlike the Republican primaries system of winner-takes-all delegates, Democrats split up delegates among the candidates (only those who cross the threshold of 15% of the votes polled) per the proportion of votes won. The target is 1,991 delegates of the 3,979 pledged delegates. A third of them, 1,357 delegates were up for grabs on Tuesday.With no or low possibility of any of the candidates wrapping up the contests before the conventions, talk has started about a contested convention in which 3,979 pledged delegates will vote to the elect the nominee in the first round. If there is still no winner, 771 super-delegates join the voting in the second round.The former vice-president finished the Super Tuesday with an overall tally of 453 delegates, 71 more than Sanders’s 382. Warren stood at 50 and Bloomberg at 44. Gabbard has one, in her birthplace American Samoas.The Super Tuesday nominating contests had looked headed Sanders’s way till a week ago. He was the frontrunner with victories in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada. He had seemed set to be on his way to the party nomination this time, unlike his failed bid in 2016, when he lost to Hillary Clinton.Then came the South Carolina primaries, last Friday. This was going to be a make-or-break contest for Biden. He had finished poorly in the three nominating contests before and his campaign had begun to face serious life-expectancy questions because of his uninspiring debate performances and depleted war chest.Boosted by a key election-eve endorsement from Jim Clyburn, a senior African American congressman, Biden scooped up South Carolina, which has a large population of African Americans, with a massive victory margin. In the hours after, he picked up endorsements of former rivals ex-mayor Pete Buttigieg, Senator Amy Klobuchar and former congressman Beto O’Rourke.Moderates in the party were coalescing around Biden to stop Sanders, troubled by his progressive policies, which he packaged as Democratic socialism. They also feared he could have a debilitating impact on Democrats in other races, for the House of Representatives and US senate.Biden’s stunning performance was fueled by the support of the African American community, specially in the souther states of Virginia, North Carolina and Alabama. But was not confined to it, as he also picked up predominantly white states of Minnesota, Oklahoma and Massachusetts.Sanders, on the other hand, struggled to retain his hold on his constituency. He had won Minnesota and Oklahoma in the 2016 primaries (though anti-Hillary Clinton votes may have been a factor at the time). And he even looked in danger of Texas, a state that was crucial to his Super Tuesday strategy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-us-vice-president-biden-rides-joementum-to-win-8-of-14-super-tuesday-contests/story-K4ki6RkieaKCw7mXXHA3KN.html

04-03-2020||World||CIA accused of 11-year long cyber espionage against China||Chinese antivirus firm Qihoo 360 said CIA hackers have spent more than a decade breaking into the Chinese airline industry and other targets, a blunt allegation of American espionage from a Beijing-based firm.In a brief blog post http://blogs.360.cn/post/APT-C-39_CIA_EN.html published on Monday in English and Chinese, Qihoo said it discovered the spying campaign by comparing samples of malicious software it had discovered against a trove of CIA digital spy tools released by WikiLeaks in 2017.Qihoo - a major cybersecurity vendor whose research is generally followed for the insight it offers into China’s digital security world - said the Central Intelligence Agency had targeted China’s aviation and energy sectors, scientific research organizations, internet companies, and government agencies. It added that the hacking of aviation targets might have been aimed at tracking “important figures’ travel itinerary.”Qihoo published a catalogue of intercepted malicious software samples as well as an analysis of their creation times that suggested that whoever devised the tools did so during working hours on the U.S. East Coast.The CIA and the Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately return messages seeking comment. A message seeking additional comment from Qihoo’s chief security officer, Yuejin Du, was not immediately returned after business hours in Beijing.The United States - like China and other world powers - rarely comments when accused of cyberespionage. There has, however, long been evidence in the public domain - released by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, in the U.S. case, or by U.S. prosecutors and private cybersecurity firms, in China’s case - that both countries hack their opponents.The allegations leveled against Beijing by U.S. companies have for years been laid out in lengthy, data-heavy reports. More recently, Chinese companies have begun doing the same with respect to other foreign hacking groups.The timing of Qihoo’s most recent publication could be related to last month’s indictment of four Chinese military hackers over a massive breach at U.S. credit reporting agency Equifax, said Adam Segal, who studies China and cybersecurity issues at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.He said outing CIA operations publicly could be a way of sending a message to Washington - while at the same time burnishing Qihoo’s reputation.“This is great public relations for them,” Segal said.Qihoo’s publication is the latest fallout from WikiLeaks’ release of CIA hacking tools in 2017.U.S. prosecutors have accused a disgruntled CIA coder, Joshua Schulte, of handing the digital espionage arsenal to WikiLeaks as revenge for a series of professional setbacks, calling the leak “instantly devastating.”“Years of work and millions of dollars developing those tools went up in smoke,” Assistant U.S. Attorney David Denton told a jury at Schulte’s trial in New York last month, according to a transcript https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6768406-20200204.html#document/p14/a549062 of his remarks.Schulte denies the allegation, saying he is being unfairly blamed for the breach because of his contentious relationship with his colleagues.The Manhattan jury in Schulte’s case is expected to begin its deliberations Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/chinese-cybersecurity-company-accuses-cia-of-11year-long-hacking-campaign/story-WkuOsd3yYk1sPV4Tif5SOL.html
04-03-2020||World||Thousands wait for hospital beds in South Korea as coronavirus cases surge||South Korea reported 516 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday as thousands of sick people waited for hospital beds in Daegu, the city at the centre of the worst outbreak outside mainland China.The new cases bring South Korea’s total to 5,328, with at least 32 deaths, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said. Most cases were in and around Daegu, the country’s fourth largest city, where the flu-like virus has spread rapidly through members of a fringe Christian group.Health officials expect the number of new cases to be high for the near future as they complete the testing of more than 200,000 members of the Christian sect, as well as thousands of other suspected cases from smaller clusters.“We need special measures in times of emergency,” South Korean Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said during a special cabinet meeting. “In order to overcome COVID-19 as quickly as possible and minimise the impact on the economy, it is necessary to proactively inject all available resources.”COVID-19 is the illness caused by the new coronavirus which emerged from central China late last year and has spread around the world.South Korean President Moon Jae-in has canceled his planned trip to the UAE, Egypt and Turkey in mid-March, due to the alarming spread of the disease at home, according to the presidential Blue House.Hospitals in South Korea’s hardest hit areas were scrambling to accommodate the surge in new patients.In Daegu, 2,300 people were waiting to be admitted to hospitals and temporary medical facilities, Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip said.A 100-bed military hospital that had been handling many of the most serious cases was due to have 200 additional beds available by Thursday, he added.On Tuesday Moon declared “war” on the virus, apologised for shortages of face masks and promised support for virus-hit small businesses in Asia’s fourth-biggest economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-wait-for-hospital-beds-in-south-korea-as-coronavirus-cases-surge/story-w50zyDW9Tn3NtfQbERoQxI.html
04-03-2020||World||NASA releases photo of mysterious hole on Mars that could hold clue to life on Red Planet||Mars never ceases to push the boundaries of human imagination - one of the reasons why efforts to get a closer look of the Red Planet has been indefatigable. A photo of an unusual hole on the planet, which was discovered in 2011, was recently posted by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The image depicts the dusty slopes of Mars’ Pavonis Mons volcano. The image was taken by the HiRISE instrument aboard the robotic Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter which currently circles the planet.Interestingly, such Martian pits appear to be “relatively good candidates” to contain life as they have interior caves that remain “relatively protected” from the planet’s harsh surface, NASA said in its blog earlier this week. Also Watch: NASA is now accepting applications for aspiring astronauts “These holes are therefore prime targets for possible future spacecraft, robots, and even human interplanetary explorers,” read the blog which was published on March 1. Also read: All aboard the Starship! Elon Musk aims to send 10 lakh people to Mars by 2050The image suggests the hole to be an opening about 35 meters across to an underground cavern which is estimated to be around 20 meters deep. While the full extent of the crater is being studied, experts speculate why is there a circular crater surrounding this hole. Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and has a very thin atmosphere. It is also one of the most explored in the solar system. The environment of the Red Planet is characterised as dusty and cold, almost desert-like. Explorers have found out that billions of years ago, the planet was much wetter, warmer with the denser atmosphere. While India and the European Space Agency (ESA) have their spacecraft in orbit above Mars, NASA has three spacecraft in orbit, one rover and one lander on the Martian surface.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasa-releases-photo-of-mysterious-hole-on-mars-that-could-hold-clue-to-life-on-red-planet/story-xfrzT4yratpxdO4gnEyRNO.html

04-03-2020||World||North Korean swagger may conceal brewing coronavirus disaster||In these days of infection and fear, a recent propaganda photo sums up the image North Korea wants to show the world, as well as its people: Soldiers with black surgical masks surround leader Kim Jong Un, ensconced in a leather overcoat and without a mask as he oversees a defiant military drill.As a new and frightening virus closes in around it, North Korea presents itself as a fortress, tightening its borders as cadres of health officials stage a monumental disinfection and monitoring program.That image of world-defying impregnability, however, may belie a brewing disaster.North Korea, which has what experts call a horrendous medical infrastructure in the best of times, shares a porous, nearly 1,450-kilometer (900-mile) border with China, where the disease originated and has since rapidly spread around the world. The North’s government has also long considered public reports on infectious disease — or, for that matter, anything that could hurt the ruling elite — matters of state secrecy.This has raised fears that North Korea, which claims zero infections, may be vastly unprepared for a virus that is testing much more developed countries across the globe — and even that infections could already be exploding within its borders.“Unfortunately, the international community has no idea if the coronavirus is spreading inside North Korea,” said a recent report by Jessica Lee, an East Asia expert at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, a think tank in Washington. “The fact that we know nothing about the level of infection or deaths within North Korea is extremely problematic and, left unchanged, could have serious public health implications.”North Korean media, meanwhile, are filled with self-described examples of ultra-vigilance — as well as a sense of urgency.Calling its anti-virus campaign a matter of “national existence,” the North has banned foreign tourists, delayed the school year, quarantined hundreds of foreigners and thousands of locals who’ve traveled abroad, shut down nearly all cross-border traffic with China, intensified screening at entry points, and mobilized tens of thousands of health workers to monitor residents and isolate those with symptoms.A parade of media photographs show North Korean doctors, scientists and health workers in masks, paper hats and protective clothing, discussing matters of science, or disinfecting public transportation, or planning ways to further protect citizens.“No special cases must be allowed within the state anti-epidemic system,” Kim, emerging recently from a prolonged period out of the public spotlight to oversee a politburo meeting on the virus, said, according to state media. Officials must “seal off all the channels and space through which the infectious disease may find its way.”On Monday, Kim’s military fired unidentified projectiles into the sea, weapons tests apparently aimed, in part, at showing that all’s well amid outside worries about an outbreak in the North.Despite the bravado, there are rising doubts that North Korea has dodged the virus.China’s U.N. ambassador, Zhang Jun, told reporters in New York that North Korea is suffering “negatively” from coronavirus, without providing details.Some North Korea monitoring groups, which claim to have a network of sources inside the nation, recently said that there are virus patients and deaths in North Korea, a claim the South Korean government couldn’t confirm.“I’m 100% sure that North Korea already has infected patients,” said Nam Sung-wook, a North Korea expert at South Korea’s Korea University who served as president of the Institute for National Security Strategy, a think tank affiliated with South Korea’s main spy agency.If North Korea had an outbreak similar to what’s happening in South Korea, the world’s hardest-hit country aside from China, it would cause serious turmoil because of a chronic lack of medical supplies and medicine, Nam said.“North Korea would be helpless,” he said.Some analysts believe that North Korea’s strong moves to shut down border areas with China, its only major ally and aid benefactor, signal that the virus has already spread into the nation from China, which has had more than 80,000 cases.There is usually heavy border traffic between the two countries, and tens of thousands of North Koreans were believed to be working in China before a U.N. order for Beijing to send them back home expired in December. It’s unknown how many of them have returned home.There have been growing outside calls for North Korea to open up about what’s going on inside its borders.The U.N. Special Rapporteur on human rights in North Korea, Tomás Ojea Quintana, urged North Korea to “allow full and unimpeded access to medical experts and humanitarian actors, and relax restrictions on access to information. Further isolation of the country is not the answer.”Ojea Quintana said that many North Koreans, especially in the countryside, lack proper access to health services, water and sanitation, and that more than 43% of the population is undernourished.The United States also expressed worry about North Korea’s vulnerability to the viral outbreak and said it was ready to support efforts by aid organizations to contain the spread of the illness in the impoverished nation.An epidemic in North Korea, which experts say has a chronic lack of medical supplies, could further shake an economy battered by U.S.-led sanctions over its nuclear weapons and missile program. That, in turn, could quicken the depletion of the North’s foreign currency reserves by choking off income from tourism and smuggling.Decreased trade with China could also dry up the goods going to North Korea’s informal private markets, which have emerged as a big part of the national economy following the collapse of the state rationing system during a devastating famine in the 1990s, experts say.And the country’s intensified anti-virus efforts could potentially hamper Kim’s ability to mobilize his people for labor on major development and tourist projects, said Lim Soo-ho, an analyst from South Korea’s Institute for National Security Strategy think tank.Despite a big economic hit to many North Koreans, however, the elite may survive a serious outbreak.“North Korea has a powerful control over its people, and that was how it maintained its leadership when 2 to 3 million people died during ‘the arduous march period,’” Oh Gyeong-seob, an analyst at Seoul’s Korea Institute for National Unification, said, referring to the North Korean euphemism for the 1990s famine.“Public dissatisfaction with Kim Jong Un will grow, but not at a level that will deal him a critical blow,” Oh predicted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korean-swagger-may-conceal-brewing-coronavirus-disaster/story-RnpcrGbIdWYMt0VFU91q3I.html
04-03-2020||World||World Bank unveils $12 billion aid package to combat coronavirus||The World Bank unveiled a $12 billion aid package on Tuesday that will provide fast-track funds to help countries combat the coronavirus outbreak.“The goal is to provide fast, effective action that responds to country needs,” World Bank President David Malpass told reporters.He said it is critical to “recognize the extra burden on poor countries” least equipped in the struggle to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus.The funds, some of which are targeted to the world’s poorest nations, can be used for medical equipment or health services and will include expertise and policy advice, the bank said in a statement.The virus that erupted in central China in December has killed more than 3,000 worldwide and infected over 90,000 people.Malpass said the money -- $8 billion of which is new -- will go to countries that request help. The bank has been in contact with many member nations, but he did not specify which are likely to be the first to receive aid.“The point is to move fast. Speed is needed to save lives,” he said in a conference call.“We want to make the best use of the World Bank’s extensive resources and global expertise and the historical knowledge of crisis,” he said, citing similar crisis funding to combat the Ebola and Zika outbreaks in recent years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-bank-unveils-12-billion-aid-package-to-combat-coronavirus/story-z45eihnReZ57WZlyIC6MoN.html
04-03-2020||World||Joe Biden wins four early states in solid super Tuesday start||Joe Biden scored four significant victories in the first round of Super Tuesday results, winning the Democratic primaries in Virginia, North Carolina, Alabama and Oklahoma. Bernie Sanders won his home state of Vermont and Colorado.Television networks declared Biden the winner in the three southern states shortly after polls closed, an indication that his victories there were decisive and could net him a large portion of the total available delegates. But states with polls closing later, particularly Texas and California, could aid Sanders, who had overtaken Biden as the front-runner in national polls.“We’re feeling optimistic,” Biden said in Los Angeles after the Virginia race was called. “I think we’re going to do well in some other states as well.”The results are a remarkable turnabout for the former vice president whose candidacy was on the ropes just days ago. A decisive win on Saturday in South Carolina rallied the Democratic Party leadership around Biden as the moderate alternative to Sanders, who’s seen by the party establishment as a candidate who can’t beat President Donald Trump. Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar fell in line, dropping out and endorsing Biden.Tuesday’s contests across 14 states, plus American Samoa, will award more than a third of all delegates to the Democratic convention in July in Milwaukee. The biggest day of the presidential primary calendar will define the nomination fight for Sanders and Biden and determine whether Michael Bloomberg -- who collected his first delegates by winning American Samoa -- and Elizabeth Warren have a rationale for carrying on their campaigns.The Super Tuesday round of primaries marks the first time Bloomberg has appeared on the Democratic presidential ballot. He and Warren, whose best performance to date was third in the Iowa caucuses, will confront the question of whether to continue in the race if they don’t collect a substantial number of delegates.(Bloomberg is the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News.)Sanders and Biden headed into the night close in delegate tallies. Sanders emerged from the first four contests with 60 delegates, but Biden’s big win in South Carolina on Saturday brought him within six delegates of his chief rival.That victory also brought Biden a clearer field through the endorsements of Klobuchar and Buttigieg, who had been competing with him for the votes of centrist Democrats.That still might not be enough. Sanders went into key tests in delegate-rich Texas and California leading in the polls, while Bloomberg threatens to play spoiler by snagging delegates in multiple states.Biden is counting on his support from African-American voters, who make up a sizable portion of the Democratic electorate in Alabama, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and Arkansas. He won 63% of the black vote in Virginia and North Carolina, according to network exit polls reported by CNN.Beyond Super Tuesday, several major caches of delegates will be available later this month with Michigan, Florida, Illinois and Ohio among the states holding primaries.“After Super Tuesday they’re all opportunities. I think I’ll do well in Florida, Michigan, it goes down the line,” Biden said Tuesday.Delivery of some results may be affected by vote-counting and weather. The outcome in California, the biggest prize of the night, may not be known for hours after polls close or even days as officials wait for mail-in ballots to arrive and be counted. In Tennessee, polling places in some parts of Nashville will stay open until 10 p.m. local time after tornadoes that swept through the area caused extensive damage and killed at least 22 people.Warren and Bloomberg have so far indicated they planned to stay in the race. Some party leaders have been calling for Bloomberg to drop out to clear the way for Biden. The former New York mayor brushed off questions Tuesday about withdrawing.“Joe’s taking votes away from me,” he said. “Have you asked Joe whether he’s going to drop out?”Bloomberg acknowledged that the only way he can secure the Democratic nomination is if neither Biden nor Sanders wins a majority of delegates and the decision is left to a battle at the party convention in July.Sanders is a self-described democratic socialist who many in the party establishment fear would return Trump to the White House. Sanders argues that the country is hungry for a “political revolution,” and he has grown a diverse base with promises of free health care, free housing, free college tuition and free child care, as well as plans to levy steep taxes on the wealthy and corporations.Sanders is likely to emerge Tuesday still holding the most delegates. Biden’s task is to win enough support to stand as a credible challenger to Sanders as the primary calendar moves to contests that stretch through June, a task that would be made easier by the growing support he’s received just since Saturday night.What Sanders, Biden and Others Need to Win on Super TuesdayThe Vermont senator will no longer benefit from a broad field of contenders for moderate voters, and it will be up to Biden to harness the momentum from his South Carolina victory and turn Klobuchar’s and Buttigieg’s endorsements into actual votes.Yet the former vice president has repeatedly bungled advantages throughout the nominating contest, and the impact of the last-minute withdrawals might be muted with millions of early-voting ballots already cast. In 2016 in California, 60% of voters cast their ballots before Election Day by early or mail-in voting.The stakes couldn’t be higher for a party that’s still reeling from Trump’s 2016 victory and is weighing diametrically opposite approaches to winning back the blue-collar, working-class voters along the Rust Belt that had long served as its electoral firewall -- Biden’s centrist vision or Sanders’ populist one.And if voters Tuesday fail to winnow the field, the odds of a contested convention – a political occurrence unseen in almost 70 years - will soar, further emboldening the incumbent president and diminishing the odds of a successful opposition challenge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-wins-four-early-states-in-solid-super-tuesday-start/story-oVRrBdmjY51aOyLIKhRF4M.html
