The most badly affected economies in this scenario will be oil-exporting countries, but also other commodity exporters, which stand to lose more than one percentage point of growth, as well as those with strong trade linkages to the initially shocked economies.Growth decelerations between 0.7 per cent and 0.9 per cent are likely to occur in countries such as Canada, Mexico and the Central American region, in the Americas; countries deeply inserted in the global value chains of East and South Asia, and countries in the immediacy of the European Union.Last week, UNCTAD had said that the trade impact of the coronavirus epidemic for India is estimated to be about USD 348 million and the country figures among the top 15 economies most affected as slowdown of manufacturing in China disrupts world trade. Slowdown of manufacturing in China due to the coronavirus outbreak is disrupting world trade and could result in a USD 50 billion decrease in exports across global value chains.Launching the UNCTAD report as world financial markets tumbled over concerns about supply-chain interruptions from China, and oil price uncertainty among major producers, Kozul-Wright warned that few countries were likely to be left unscathed by the outbreak’s financial ramifications.One “Doomsday scenario” in which the world economy grew at only 0.5 per cent, would involve “a USD 2 trillion hit” to gross domestic product, he said, adding that collapsing oil prices had been “a contributing factor to that growing sense of unease and panic.” While it was difficult to predict how the international financial markets will react to COVID-19’s impacts “what they do suggest is a world that is extremely anxious,” he said.“There’s a degree of anxiety now that’s well beyond the health scares which are very serious and concerning.” To counter these fears, “Governments need to spend at this point in time to prevent the kind of meltdown that could be even more damaging than the one that is likely to take place over the course of the year,” Kozul-Wright said.UNCTAD’s analysis points out that a persistent belief in the soundness of economic fundamentals and a self-correcting world economy continues to hamper policy thinking in the advanced economies.“This will stymie the bolder policy interventions needed to prevent the threat of a more serious crisis and increases the chances that recurrent shocks will cause serious economic damage in the future,” Kozul-Wright added.Central Banks are not in a position to solve this crisis alone and an appropriate macroeconomic policy response will need aggressive fiscal spending with significant public investment, including into the care economy, and targeted welfare support for adversely affected workers, businesses and communities, the analysis says. International coordination of these programmes will be required.“Ultimately, a series of dedicated policy responses and institutional reforms are needed to prevent a localized health scare in a food market in Central China from turning into a global economic meltdown,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-outbreak-could-cost-global-economy-up-to-usd-2-trillion-unctad/story-67JgNlPvO0x2C5ZO8XTlvN.html
10-03-2020||World||China backs Ghani, congratulates him on re-election as Afghanistan President||China on Tuesday congratulated Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani on his re-election and called on all parties to accelerate the reconstruction and peace process in the war-torn country.President Ghani and his rival leader Abdullah Abdullah were each sworn in as president in separate ceremonies on Monday, throwing plans for peace negotiations with the Taliban into chaos and creating a piquant situation for the international community.Ghani was declared as the winner of the presidential election in September, but Abdullah rejected the vote and held a parallel swearing-in ceremony surrounded by hundreds of his supporters on Monday.The drama unfolded in Kabul as the US began withdrawing its troops from Afghanistan as part of the initial troop withdrawal required in the US-Taliban peace agreement signed between America and the Taliban in Doha on February 29.Asked about the separate swearing-in ceremonies of Ghani and Abdullah, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a media briefing here that China congratulated Ghani’s re-election, in a clear backing of the incumbent president from Beijing.“China respects Afghan people’s independent choice and decision on the future of their nation. We congratulate Ghani’s election as President,” Geng said.“We call on parties in Afghanistan to bear in mind the interest of their nation and people consolidate consensus and accelerate the process of reconstruction and peace. We are willing to work with the new administration and the people in all sectors to promote the friendly relations between our two countries for the benefit of our peoples,” he said.“Now the situation in Afghanistan is at crucial stage. The Taliban and the US have signed an agreement, the inter-Afghanistan negotiation is hopeful to be held soon,” he said.Geng said the people of Afghanistan were facing a “precious opportunity” to bring a four-decade-long conflict to an end, but asserted that there was also a “severe challenge” involved.“We hope the international community will respect the Afghan people’s will and continue to support inter-Afghan peace and reconciliation. We also call on the foreign armies to withdraw in orderly and responsible manner ensure a transition to avoid terrorist organization’s expansion,” he said.The US, which invaded Afghanistan and toppled the Taliban in 2001, signed an agreement aimed at “bringing peace” to Afghanistan with Taliban last month.Under the agreement, the US and NATO allies have agreed to withdraw all troops within 14 months if the Taliban uphold the deal.Under the deal, the militants also agreed not to allow al-Qaeda or any other extremist group to operate in the areas they control.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-backs-ghani-congratulates-him-on-re-election-as-afghanistan-president/story-CmyZWGw51k7evdleqsdfGO.html
10-03-2020||World||Iran reports 54 new coronavirus deaths, death toll reaches 291||Iran said Tuesday that the new coronavirus killed 54 more people, raising the death toll to 291 amid 8,042 cases in the Islamic Republic.Health Ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour made the announcement in a televised news conference. It represented an 18% increase in deaths from the day before and 12% more confirmed cases.Iran is the hardest-hit country in the Mideast by the new coronavirus, which sickens but largely doesn’t kill those afflicted.Elsewhere, Lebanese Health Ministry official said a man has died from the coronavirus, marking the first known death from the COVID-19 illness in the country.The official says the 56-year-old man had recently returned from Egypt. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to give official statements.The Mediterranean country has 41 confirmed cases of of the new coronavirus -- most of them linked to Iran. At least one patient who returned from Iran has left the hospital after two weeks successful treatment.Lebanon has been hit by a severe financial and economic crisis since October, particularly after mass protests against the country’s ruling elite broke out in October. But street demonstrations have been minimal since the outbreak of the coronavirus.Across the region, there are over 8,600 confirmed cases of the virus. Worldwide, there are over 110,000 confirmed cases of the new virus, with more than 3,800 deaths attributed to it. The number of people who have recovered is about 62,000.For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. In mainland China, where the virus first exploded, more than 80,000 people have been diagnosed and more than 58,000 have so far recovered.___Associated Press writer Zeina Karam in Beirut contributed to this report.___The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

10-03-2020||World||Pope tells priests to ‘have the courage’ to go out and meet coronavirus sick||Pope Francis urged Catholic priests on Tuesday to “have the courage” to go out and help those sickened by the novel coronavirus, hours after Italy was placed on a nationwide lockdown.“Let us pray to the Lord also for our priests, that they may have the courage to go out and visit the sick... and to accompany the medical staff and volunteers in the work they do,” the pontiff said during a mass in Vatican City.St Peter’s Square in the Vatican -- in the centre of the Italian capital Rome -- was almost empty on Tuesday with only a few dozen people walking around, most of them without masks.The Italian government has asked for people not to travel if they can avoid it and to avoid contact with the sick. Officials passed a decree late Monday extending nationwide restrictive measures that had been put in place at the weekend in the hardest-hit northern regions. The restrictions -- including checkpoints on roads and in railway stations -- are set to remain until April 3.Italy is the epicentre of the European virus outbreak with more than 9,000 cases and 463 deaths so far.Globally, more than 110,000 cases have been recorded in over 100 countries, although health experts are hopeful that the virus has peaked in China, where it originated late last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-tells-priests-to-have-the-courage-to-go-out-and-meet-coronavirus-sick/story-gEex5WR64lE9UYQFrS0haO.html
10-03-2020||World||Italy wakes up to deserted streets in unprecedented coronavirus lockdown||Italy woke up on to deserted streets in an unprecedented lockdown on Tuesday after the government extended quarantine measures across the entire country in a bid to slow Europe’s worst outbreak of the coronavirus.The measures, announced late on Monday by Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, widen steps already taken in the rich northern region of Lombardy and parts of neighbouring provinces, clamping down on movement and closing public spaces.“The future of Italy is in our hands. Let us all do our part, by giving up something for our collective good,” Conte said in a tweet, encouraging people to take personal responsibility.For at least the next three weeks, people have been told to move around only for reasons of work, for health needs or emergencies or else stay at home. Anyone travelling will have to fill in a document declaring their reasons and carry it with them.Large gatherings and outdoor events, including sports, have been banned, while bars and restaurants will have to close from 6 p.m. Schools and universities will remain closed until April 3.“The whole of Italy is closed now,” was the headline in the Corriere della Sera newspaper.As day broke, the streets of Rome were erily much quieter than normal, with cars circulating freely under a clear blue sky in the normally traffic-clogged centre, reflecting the atmosphere in the financial capital Milan, already under stricter controls. Rome commuters could easily find seats in the usually jam-packed underground system during the morning rush hours.People wearing masks in the streets of the capital was more widespread than before.Shortly after the measures were announced, shoppers in Rome rushed to late-night supermarkets to stock up on food and basic necessities, promoting the government to declare that supplies would be guaranteed and urging people not to panic buy.Shops are allowed to remain open as long as customers maintain a minimum distance of a metre between them.The measures came after the latest data showed the coronavirus outbreak continuing to rise, with 9,172 positive cases recorded as of Monday and 463 deaths, the second highest-level in the world after China.The World Health Organization has praised Italy’s “aggressive” response to the crisis, since the first cases emerged near Milan almost three weeks ago but the economic cost has been huge.On Monday, the Milan stock exchange dropped over 11% and Italy’s borrowing costs shot up, reviving fears that an economy already on the brink of recession and struggling under the euro zone’s second-heaviest debt pile could be plunged into crisis.Conte has already promised “massive shock therapy” to help deal with the immediate economic impact of the crisis and on Tuesday, Industry Minister Stefano Patuanelli said the government would approve measures worth around 10 billion euros.

10-03-2020||World||Philippines has just 2,000 coronavirus testing kits and cases are rising||The Philippines, with a population of more than 100 million, had only 2,000 novel coronavirus test kits available earlier this week as the number of infections jumped.Its government once had 4,500 kits in stock, but the number dwindled to 2,000 by Monday as the number of people who wanted to be diagnosed surged, Health Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said on Monday. Confirmed cases in the Southeast Asian nation had increased to 33 on Tuesday.The limited number of testing kits is constraining the country’s ability to test more people for the virus, Health Secretary Francisco Duque said this week, making people showing any symptoms a priority.The shortage of diagnostic kits in the Philippines underscores resource constraints and rising costs that countries face as the virus spreads globally. Singapore said on Monday that it would stop funding treatments for short-term visitors including tourists while testing will remain free for everyone.“Will we test 104 million Filipinos? That doesn’t seem to be the correct approach,” Philippines’ Duque said on Tuesday.His comments came after Senator Nancy Binay criticized health officials at a hearing on virus preparations for their seeming lack of readiness to deal with the outbreak. “I don’t want to panic but you’re making me panic,” she said.On the brighter side, a testing kit developed by the University of the Philippines’ National Institutes of Health was accredited by the Food and Drug Administration on Monday. There are also 2,000 other kits expected to arrive from the World Health Organization this week, the health department said.Economic officials recommended 2.92 billion pesos ($58 million) in extra health funding to boost testing and contact tracing, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez said in a briefing.Test at HomeElsewhere in the region, Singapore developed its own coronavirus diagnostic kit, according to a Facebook post from Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat, and they are prepared to ship them to other countries.In Malaysia, people without symptoms but want to be reassured they’re okay can pay private companies to be tested at home, Noor Hisham Abdullah, the country’s director-general of health, said Monday. IHH Healthcare Bhd.’s Pantai and Gleneagles hospitals and Qualitas Medical Group Sdn. clinics are among those involved in the program.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/philippines-has-just-2-000-coronavirus-testing-kits-and-cases-are-rising/story-af53ZeiSPie6FvRsvmZoCM.html
10-03-2020||World||Led by Italy lockdown, Europe struggles to limit coronavirus spread||European leaders scrambled for a unified response to the new coronavirus as Italy became the first democratic country since World War II to announce a simultaneous quarantine and nationwide curfew.Schools, employers and cities across the region implemented their own piecemeal lockdowns to slow the spread of the highly infectious virus. Schoolchildren in Madrid and university students in Austria and Portugal stayed home, while Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte called on people in the country’s hardest-hit province to work from home. Air France canceled thousands of flights, Ireland scrapped the March 17 St. Patrick’s Day celebrations and Madonna pulled out of concerts in Paris slated for Tuesday and Wednesday.As people and businesses struggle to work with the new restrictions, European leaders will hold an emergency call on Tuesday afternoon to discuss a response to the deadly virus. On the cusp of turning into a pandemic, the virus has claimed more than 520 lives on the continent. Close to 500 of those deaths have been in Italy. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte called this the country’s “darkest hour,” ordering Italians to “stay at home” as he explained that “we are forced to impose sacrifices.”“This is not an easy situation to live and decisions by governments are not taken lightly,” said EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides, speaking at the European Parliament in Brussels. “This cannot be business as usual; we are facing an exceptional situation.” All 27 EU nations have now reported cases, she said.Globally, the number of those infected has surpassed 113,000, with deaths exceeding 3,900. While China, where the virus originated, is seeing the pace of new infections slowing, there are no indications its spread is in check in Europe.That’s driving countries across the region to put more measures in place. In Spain, where confirmed cases more than doubled between Sunday and Monday, authorities closed schools and universities in Madrid and the surrounding area for two weeks starting March 11.In Germany, Health Minister Jens Spahn pushed for gatherings of more than 1,000 people to be canceled, but left the final call on cancellations up to local health authorities. France barred gatherings of 50 or more people in clusters where infections have soared. Ireland halted the St. Patrick’s Day parades, which typically attract half a million spectators, with thousands traveling from overseas.Still, the restrictions in Italy are by far the most stringent. After trying to lock down the northern region of Lombardy, Conte moved to widen curbs by decree to the entire nation of more than 60 million. Schools and universities will be closed nationwide, all public events will be canceled, and Italians won’t be allowed to travel without a business or health-related justification until April 3. Conte’s decision came after the number of cases in the country soared by 25% to 9,172 on Monday.“All of Italy is now closed,” Milan daily Corriere della Sera wrote on its front page Tuesday. “Everyone at home,” Rome-based la Repubblica wrote.The business community appeared to rally around the prime minister on Tuesday. Marcella Panucci, director general of employers lobby Confindustria, said in an interview with Bloomberg TV that the full lockdown was justified.“We fear a shock on credit,” she warned, calling on the government to offer guarantees and investment to shore up an economy under siege.Panic ButtonCompanies elsewhere are taking their own measures. Deutsche Bank AG on Monday said it’s splitting investment bank teams in London and Frankfurt after an employee in its Frankfurt headquarters tested positive for the virus. The board of Banco Santander SA asked shareholders to remote into its April 2 annual meeting and make use of proxy-granting. The bank also asked employees in Madrid to work from home for 15 days.In Italy, the impact of the lockdown won’t become clear for at least a month, Giovanni Rezza, head of the infectious diseases department at the Superior Health Institute told Corriere della Sera.“What matters more than government measures is how individuals behave,” he said. “People haven’t realized how much they’re at risk.”With the economy already on the brink of recession, Conte will ask parliament Wednesday for authorization to deviate from planned deficit targets to fund an economic stimulus package. The government may increase the value of the package, including more health and spending and help for businesses and families, to about 10 billion euros ($11.4 billion) from 7.5 billion euros, according to a deputy minister and two officials who asked not to be named discussing confidential deliberations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/led-by-italy-lockdown-europe-struggles-to-limit-coronavirus-spread/story-I8a6XEcs6TnRgfo0SJo8WM.html
10-03-2020||World||Russia says it expects ‘good relations’ with Taliban as US troops exit||Russia said it expects to build close ties with the Taliban as American forces start withdrawing from Afghanistan under a peace deal signed last month.“We want to have normal ties with any new administration in Kabul,” President Vladimir Putin’s envoy to Afghanistan, Zamir Kabulov, said in an interview on Friday in Moscow. “The Taliban understands very well that when they join the government, they’ll need to work for national interests and for that they’ll need good relations with Russia.”The peace agreement reached in the Qatari capital after 19 years of war provides for the U.S. and its allies to pull out all troops within 14 months, in return for a Taliban pledge to prevent terrorist groups such as Islamic State and al-Qaeda from using Afghanistan as a haven. It also sets the stage for the Taliban to hold talks with Afghanistan’s government to decide the political future of the conflict-torn country.Russia has courted the Taliban, which controls or contests about half of the territory in Afghanistan, saying the militant group can be a potential ally in the fight against Islamic State. The U.S. pull-out to end the longest conflict in American history is providing the Kremlin with a chance to reclaim its clout in the country, where the Soviet Union fought a decade-long war before completing a humiliating withdrawal in 1989. The two former Cold War rivals are also in competition in the Middle East where Russia is seeking to restore its Soviet-era influence.‘It’s a Risk’The administration of Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, a U.S. ally, is reluctant to enter into peace talks with the Taliban because “the Kabul leadership is afraid that these talks will lead to their departure,” said Kabulov.While a power-sharing government is “absolutely realistic,” if the negotiations don’t happen, the Taliban will continue to make territorial advances, said the Russian envoy. “They won’t lose their chance and will strengthen their control of territory,” he said.The U.S. has accused Russia in the past of supplying weapons to the Taliban, allegations Moscow has denied. The movement won’t be able to impose the same hard-line Islamic rule as in the 1990s, according to Kabulov. “We told them we won’t accept a return of the Islamic Emirate,” he said.The top Russian official also criticized the U.S. for carrying out air strikes against the Taliban to prevent it from staging small-scale attacks on the Afghan military, which he said it didn’t commit to stop under the peace agreement. “It’s a risk,” said Kabulov. “If the U.S. genuinely wants to bring the peace process to a logical conclusion -- a cease-fire and inter-Afghan dialog -- they shouldn’t act in this way.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-says-it-expects-good-relations-with-taliban-as-us-troops-exit/story-kclzfuiPI09r4LHrkrRy3M.html
10-03-2020||World||Bangladesh PM postpones visit to Japan over coronavirus outbreak||Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has postponed her two-day official visit to Japan over the global outbreak of the deadly novel coronavirus, Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen said on Tuesday.“The prime minister was scheduled to travel to Japan on March 30. But the visit has been postponed as the novel coronavirus cases have spread there too,” Momen was quoted as saying by Bdnews24.com.Hasina was scheduled to leave for Japan on March 30 on a two-day official visit. “We will visit Japan later and they (Japan) have agreed to the deferred plan,” Momen added.Earlier this week, Bangladesh postponed the March 17 grand inaugural ceremony of the birth centenary celebrations of its founder Sheikh Mujibur Rahman after three coronavirus cases were detected in the country.Two persons brought the disease from Italy, infecting the third one on their return home, officials said.The infections, the first reported cases in the country, came four days after Dhaka restricted entry of the people from major coronavirus-prone countries without a virus-free medical certificate.The virus that first originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December last year has claimed over 4,000 lives and infected more than 110,000 across 100 nations and territories.The World Health Organisation last week raised the global virus risk to maximum level after the outbreak spread to sub-Saharan Africa and stock markets around the world plummeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-pm-postpones-visit-to-japan-over-coronavirus-outbreak/story-UU1DTcHOvra5JntnPpQnLM.html
10-03-2020||World||Russian lawmakers to vote on sweeping reforms||Russian lawmakers vote Tuesday on a package of constitutional reforms as President Vladimir Putin looks to put his stamp on the country for decades to come.The reforms -- expected to sail through the lower house State Duma in the key second reading -- will overhaul Russia’s political system and enshrine conservative values in the country’s basic law.Critics have accused Putin of planning to use the proposals to hold on to power after his current term expires in 2024. Others suggest that after more than 20 years in power, Putin is preparing for a smooth succession, amid fears of a chaotic struggle for power when the longtime leader goes. “This isn’t about me,” Putin, 67, said at a meeting with the public in the central city of Ivanovo on Friday. “We are proposing amendments not for five or 10 years but at least for 30 to 50 years. This is not about now.”Putin shocked the country by announcing the reforms during his state of the nation speech in January, with Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev’s unpopular government resigning a few hours later. They will be the first major changes to Russia’s constitution since 1993, when a new basic law was adopted following the collapse of the Soviet Union.SLEW OF REFORMSThe reforms will give parliament the power to choose the government, while strengthening some presidential powers and increasing the role of the State Council, an advisory body. This fuelled speculation that Putin could stay on after 2024 as the head of the State Council, though he has denied any wish to remain in power.Some proposals aim at boosting living standards, including a guaranteed minimum wage and state pensions adjusted to inflation. And -- in line with Putin’s strongly conservative views -- the reforms would enshrine a mention of Russians’ “faith in God” and spell out that marriage is a heterosexual union. The State Duma, dominated by Putin’s allies, unanimously approved an initial version of the reform bill in a first reading in late January, after less than two hours of debate. The session for the second reading began at noon (0900 GMT) on Tuesday.A third reading -- largely considered a final technicality -- may take place as early as Wednesday. The upper house Federation Council has also put the reforms bill on its agenda for Wednesday.Putin has promised a public vote on the reforms once they are approved by parliament, though it is unclear exactly what form that vote will take. A date for a plebescite has been set for April 22.Russia’s opposition, including Putin’s most prominent critic Alexei Navalny, have criticised the proposals, but there has not been an upswell of public resistance.According to a study by the Levada Centre, an independent pollster, 64 percent of Russians did not have a clear idea of what the proposals meant. A quarter of Russians said they would back the amendments, while 23 percent said they would not vote.‘CONSERVATIVE MANIFESTO’An editorial in business daily Vedomosti called the proposed amendments a “conservative manifesto” -- the political legacy that Putin wanted to leave to future generations.Political commentator Maxim Trudolyubov said it was a plan to immortalise Putin’s legacy.Writing in the Russian edition of Forbes, Trudolyubov called the new legislation an attempt to “codify Putin”, in other words “to create an undying political body that will be able to live longer than an average mortal president”.It is unclear why Putin is pushing ahead with the reforms now, though some observers say he is anxious to head off a power struggle as he approaches his term limit. Others have pointed to Putin’s flagging poll numbers since his re-election in 2018, as Russia’s economy struggles under the weight of Western sanctions and as living standards fall.The economy is set for more turbulence in the coming weeks and potentially months after oil prices crashed following the collapse of the production limits deal between Russia and Saudi Arabia.Russia’s economy is heavily dependent on energy exports. The ruble tumbled to a four-year low on Monday and the RTS stock index dived more than 10 percent at Tuesday’s opening.Russia has huge financial reserves to weather these kinds of crises, but Putin had planned to tap the funds for a series of major infrastructure projects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-lawmakers-to-vote-on-sweeping-reforms/story-8hvubdjej3KMYe8PrOCSMK.html
10-03-2020||World||Xi Jinping visits epicentre Wuhan; sign that China believes coronavirus outbreak has turned a corner||A mask-wearing President Xi Jinping on Tuesday visited Wuhan, the city at the centre of the coronavirus epidemic, for the first time since the start of the outbreak as national health authorities continued to report a dramatic fall in new cases of covid-19 in China.Xi’s visit to Wuhan, a city under a lockdown since January 23, is a sign of the highest confidence within the Communist Party of China (CPC)-ruled government that the epidemic has turned a corner in China.Until this visit, Xi’s second-in-command, Premier Li Keqiang was the senior-most Chinese leader to have visited Wuhan in late January as the outbreak raged in the city and the province of Hubei.On Tuesday, Chinese state media reported on the President first visiting a hospital built in nine days to make space for an overwhelming number of patients, meeting frontline doctors and nurses, volunteers and residents in Wuhan.State media showed Xi speaking via video-link to frontline medics and patients at one of the field hospitals set up in the city, an agency report said.The Chinese President’s visit is also a message to the world that the Chinese way of controlling the epidemic – locking down hundreds of millions in their homes and putting in place severe restrictions on travel – has worked despite criticisms and concerns.The state media’s coverage of the China’s epidemic control has glossed over ample evidence to show that neither local nor central authorities had acted despite their knowledge about the spreading coronavirus weeks before the lockdowns in the worst-hit Hubei province were put in place.Xi’s visit to Wuhan will also likely add layers to the Chinese state’s narrative obfuscating the delay and negligence; and aggressively promote instead the tale of how China is winning the “people’s war” against the virus, which, of course, will be no mean feat as the rest of world suddenly grapples with the pathogen.Xi’s Tuesday visit coincided with a new low in fresh coronavirus cases in China: In the last 24 hours, it was only 19, down from several hundred cases just weeks earlier.As of Tuesday, there have been 80,754 cases of the virus confirmed across China, 67,760 of which were in Hubei, the province of which Wuhan is the capital. Of the 3,136 deaths confirmed in China, all but 112 have been in Hubei.Official news agency, Xinhua, reported that Xi arrived in Wuhan on Tuesday“…for an inspection of the epidemic prevention and control work”.Xi, according to Xinhua, “will visit and express regards to medical workers, military officers and soldiers, community workers, police officers, officials and volunteers who have been fighting the epidemic on the front line, as well as patients and residents during the inspection.”It was more than a month ago that the death of Li Wenliang, a doctor who died from the covid-19 illness in February, sparked a wave of grief and anger online. Liwas among a group of people who had raised the alarm as early as late December but was harassed and detained by the Wuhan police for doing so.A visit by vice premier Sun Chunlan to a Wuhan residential community last week was met with angry public heckling, showing how easily state propaganda efforts could backfire, the news agency AFP reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-jinping-visits-epicentre-wuhan-sign-that-china-believes-coronavirus-outbreak-has-turned-a-corner/story-83qk6jYwVb7CAWYNcnoFDO.html
10-03-2020||World||China’s Xi pays first visit to virus epicentre Wuhan||Chinese President Xi Jinping arrived in Wuhan on Tuesday for his first visit to the epicentre of the coronavirus epidemic since the crisis erupted in January -- a major sign that officials believe the outbreak is under control.Xi’s unannounced visit comes as unprecedented quarantine measures that have sealed off Wuhan and the rest of central Hubei province since late January appear to have paid off, with new infections dropping dramatically in recent weeks.The Communist Party leader arrived by plane in Hubei’s capital for an “inspection of the epidemic prevention and control work” in the region, according to the official Xinhua news agency.State media showed Xi, wearing a mask, speaking via video-link to frontline medical workers and patients at one of the field hospitals set up in the city.Xi will also visit military officials, community workers, police, patients and residents, Xinhua said.China’s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong is usually a daily fixture in state media but has stayed out of the spotlight for much of the crisis and assigned Premier Li Keqiang to oversee the response to the epidemic.Li and a vice premier have already visited the virus-stricken city of Wuhan.But as the number of new cases has fallen in recent weeks, state media has played up Xi’s role in the fight against the outbreak, releasing a speech last month in which he said he had been giving instructions since early January.“During the worst of the outbreak, Xi avoided the epicentre because he did not want to be blamed, but when the situation gets better, he shows up in order to receive praise,” said Bruce Lui, a senior lecturer in journalism at Hong Kong Baptist University. Authorities have faced rare and fierce criticism online over their handling of the virus, with local officials coming under particular scrutiny for punishing whistleblowers in an apparent attempt to cover up the outbreak in early January.Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a political science professor at Hong Kong Baptist University, said that the carefully orchestrated visit was “long overdue for most Chinese”.“Xi is trying to regain the initiative, to show that he is a considerate and caring leader, but also that he is in charge,” he said.Global cases soarThe death of doctor Li Wenliang, who died from the COVID-19 illness in February, sparked a wave of grief and anger online. He was among a group of people who had raised the alarm as early as December.A visit by vice premier Sun Chunlan to a Wuhan residential community last week was met with angry public heckling, showing how easily state propaganda efforts could backfire. “Sun had to bear these risk factors first for Xi, like clearing a minefield before he arrived,” said Lui. The virus is believed to have emerged in December at a market that sold wild animals in Wuhan before ballooning into a national and then a global epidemic.More than 4,000 people have died and over 110,000 have been infected worldwide, with the majority in China, though daily infections are now growing at a much faster pace abroad.China reported only 19 new cases on Tuesday, the lowest figure since it started publishing data on January 21.Seventeen cases were in Wuhan while the other two were imported from abroad.The country had been tallying thousands of cases every week in January and most of February.Alfred Wu, associate professor at the National University of Singapore’s Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, said that Xi’s visit was to signal that the “outbreak has basically ended in China”, given the steady decline in new cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-xi-pays-first-visit-to-virus-epicentre-wuhan/story-oFGwkhvBOfxv096wgKYeeK.html

These lawmakers had come into contact with someone at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) who tested positive for the deadly coronavirus.The virus is believed to have an incubation period of about 14 days. Earlier during a news conference, Trump assured the country that his administration is taking all necessary steps to bring it under control. “We are going to take care of, and have been taking care of, the American public and the American economy,” he said.Vice President Mike Pence, who is leading the efforts on coronavirus, said the risk of contracting the virus to the American public remains low, and the risk of serious disease among the American public also remains low.“The President did deploy not just a whole-of-government approach, but also a whole-of-America approach. And last week, at the President’s direction, we met with leaders in industries, from nursing homes to airlines, pharmaceutical companies, commercial labs, and it’s had great, great impact,” he said.“Pharmaceutical companies are already working, literally around the clock, on the development of therapeutics; that will be medicines that can bring relief to people that contract the coronavirus. I know how pleased the President was to learn that the commercial labs in this country, led by companies like LabCorp and Quest, have already brought a test forward and are taking that to market effective today,” he said.This week, they plan to have meetings with hospital CEOs, health insurance CEOs, and building on top of what the President will be announcing tomorrow with regard to economic relief for working Americans.The global death toll from the new coronavirus crossed 3,800 on Tuesday, as China reported 17 new deaths. The virus has spread to over 100 countries with more than 110,000 cases of infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-says-us-president-trump-not-tested-for-coronavirus/story-s51dtptJvMRndJXaBNavlM.html
10-03-2020||World||Threat of coronavirus pandemic ‘has become very real’, says WHO||The coronavirus is closer to causing a pandemic but outbreaks in countries can still be controlled through a combination of containment and mitigation measures, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Monday.“Now that the virus has a foothold in so many countries, the threat of a pandemic has become very real,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general, told a news conference. “But it would be the first pandemic that could be controlled. The bottom line is we are not at the mercy of the virus.”Four countries account for 93% of the nearly 110,000 cases worldwide, Tedros said. “We are encouraged that Italy is taking aggressive measures to contain its epidemic and we hope that those measures prove effective in the coming days,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/threat-of-coronavirus-pandemic-has-become-very-real-says-who/story-w94KSm25E2B4g1EOJBqjCP.html
