It specifically red-flagged “microcap stocks”, low-priced shares of small, less-known companies.“We have become aware of a number of Internet promotions, including on social media, claiming that the products or services of publicly-traded companies can prevent, detect, or cure coronavirus, and that the stock of these companies will dramatically increase in value as a result,” SEC’s office of investor education and advocacy said in a statement.It did not list specific promotions but said they could come in the form of “research reports” with predictions of specific “target price”, a valuation of the stock.The SEC temporarily suspended trading of two companies. In the first case, the regulator said it was concerned about the accuracy and adequacy of information available about the viability of the company’s product to treat the coronavirus. And, in the second, SEC had issues with the company’s “purported international marketing rights” to an approved coronavirus treatment.Fears and concerns about the spread of coronavirus in the United States have been growing even as the Trump administration has sought to reassure Americans that most of them face a “low” risk of contracting the illness. It has also announced new and expanded travel restrictions as fresh cases are being reported from various parts of the country, including the first death.While people stock up on emergency supplies, such as masks, which are going at a premium, some among them may be tempted to cash in on it, specially by low-priced stocks of health-related companies that are suddenly zooming, pumped up by fraudsters as part of a scam.The SEC warned specifically about “microcap stocks”, low-prices shares of small companies about whom not enough information is available publicly. Unsuspecting investors are lured to them by fraudsters through, what the regulator said, were “pump-and-dump” schemes. False and misleading claims are spread through promotions about these stocks, which also begin to rise because of buying by the scammers. And once they have made enough, they are known to just dump the stocks, leaving other investors holding on to worthless stocks that will never ever rise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-regulator-warns-against-companies-claiming-to-have-ability-to-stop-coronavirus/story-85i5hyaVN2wSsgCUBBZlGP.html
02-03-2020||World||UK to probe ‘bullying’ charges against home secretary Priti Patel||Britain’s Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday announced an inquiry into swirling allegations of ‘bullying’ and worse against home secretary Priti Patel, whose top official in the Home Office last week publicly resigned, accusing her of a ‘vicious’ campaign against him.Patel, who has been in the news for accusations of alleged ill-treatment of officials, was not in the House of Commons when the inquiry was announced by senior cabinet minister Michael Gove. She has rejected the allegations and Johnson has expressed full confidence in her.Gove told MPs: “Allegations have been made that the home secretary has breached the ministerial code. The home secretary absolutely rejects these allegations. The prime minister has expressed his full confidence in her”.“This government always takes any complaints relating to the ministerial code seriously, and in line with the process set out in the ministerial code the prime minister has asked the Cabinet Office to establish the facts”.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn wanted independent lawyers to be involved in the inquiry. He said he was alarmed by reports that Patel told her civil servants to find a way of overturning a court judgment about an extradition case.According to Corbyn, the Johnson government is “led by bullies” and presided over by a “part-time PM”.Last week, Philip Rutnam, permanent secretary in the Home Office, tendered his public resignation and announced his intention to sue the government in a tribunal for constructive dismissal.Rutnam said his experience had been “extreme”, adding that he had received allegations that Patel’s conduct included “shouting and swearing, belittling people, making unreasonable and repeated demands - behaviour that created fear and that needed some bravery to call out”.Accusing Patel of orchestrating a campaign against him, he said in a statement: “In the last 10 days, I have been the target of a vicious and orchestrated briefing campaign. It has been alleged that I have briefed the media against the home secretary”.“This - along with many other claims - is completely false. The home secretary categorically denied any involvement in this campaign to the Cabinet Office. I regret I do not believe her. She has not made the efforts I would expect to dissociate herself from the comments.”“Despite my efforts to engage with her, Priti Patel has made no effort to engage with me to discuss this. I believe that these events give me very strong grounds to claim constructive, unfair dismissal and I will be pursuing that claim in the courts”.“My experience has been extreme, but I consider there is evidence that it was part of wider pattern of behaviour. One of my duties as permanent secretary was to protect the health, safety and well-being of our 35,000 people”.“I have received allegations that her conduct has included shouting and swearing, belittling people, making unreasonable and repeated demands - behaviour that created fear and that needed some bravery to call out”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-probe-bullying-charges-against-home-secretary-priti-patel/story-Wq5whWoeC6eIMjpxywbo3K.html

The limited truce between the Taliban, US and Afghan forces preceded the signing of a landmark deal between the insurgents and Washington in Doha on Saturday.But on Monday the Taliban announced they would resume attacks against Afghan forces, only a day after President Ashraf Ghani committed to continuing the partial truce at least until talks between Kabul and the Taliban kick off, supposedly on March 10.Since the deal signing, the Taliban have been publicly celebrating their “victory” over the US.The agreement sets out a timetable for foreign forces to quit Afghanistan within 14 months, subject to Taliban security guarantees and a pledge by the insurgents to hold talks with the Kabul government.The dramatic reduction in attacks due to last week’s partial truce offered Afghans a rare opportunity to go about their daily lives without fear of violence.The insurgents’ vow to resume attacks came a day after Ghani warned he was not committed to a key clause in the Doha deal involving the release of thousands of Taliban prisoners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/three-killed-11-injured-in-blast-at-football-match-in-east-afghanistan-police/story-q0LnoeiSx64rSXKDE48EvI.html

Foreign troops in Afghanistan should withdraw in an orderly and responsible manner to ensure a smooth transition and void a security vacuum especially to prevent terrorist groups from growing stronger in Afghanistan,’’ Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian said on Monday. “We think it is important to political settlement of the Afghan issue. China firmly supports the Afghan-led, Afghan own, broad and comprehensive and inclusive peace and reconciliation process,” he said.“We call on the Taliban and all parties in Afghanistan to seize the opportunity and start inter-Afghan talks as soon as possible to discuss political and security arrangements acceptable to all and make joint efforts for lasting peace and stability in Afghanistan,” he said.In September, a Taliban delegation had met China’s special representative for Afghanistan in Beijing to discuss the group’s peace talks with the US.Along with Pakistan, China also has a trilateral foreign ministers’ dialogue, which has so far met three times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/seed-of-peace-china-calls-us-taliban-peace-accord/story-2ukg7aTd9G4kJO6f70Ea2I.html

02-03-2020||World||Child dies as migrants rush to cross Greek-Turkish border||Greek police fired tear gas at migrants trying to push into Greece from Turkey through the land border Monday, and a child died when a dinghy boat capsized during a sea crossing, after Turkey opened its frontier for migrants and refugees to enter Europe.The child’s death, reported by the Greek coast guard, was the first since thousands of migrants began massing at the frontiers with Greece over the weekend after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced an easing of restrictions on those wishing to cross to Europe.His announcement Thursday marked a dramatic departure from a previous policy of containing the hundreds of thousands of refugees and migrants in Turkey. Erdogan apparently aims to pressure Europe into offering Turkey more support in dealing with the fallout from the Syrian war to its south.Thousands of migrants on Monday tried to find a way across Turkey’s land border into Greece, which has made clear its borders will remain closed. Dozens managing to pass through either border fences or fording the river there. As Greek police fired tear gas, a group of several hundred holding white flags shouted “peace, peace,” asking to be let into Greece. Others were trying to reach Greek islands from the Turkish coast.Turkey’s decision to ease border restrictions came amid a Russian-backed Syrian government offensive into Syria’s northwestern Idlib province. That offensive has killed dozens of Turkish troops and led to a surge of nearly a million Syrian civilians fleeing toward Turkey’s sealed border, threatening a dramatic new influx of displaced into a country that already hosts 3.5 million Syrian refugees.Fighting on the ground in Idlib continued Monday, with heavy clashes between Syrian government forces and Turkish-backed fighters. Syrian troops retook the strategic town of Saraqeb, which lies on the Damascus-Aleppo highway, although violence continued nearby. The Kremlin said Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin would meet in Moscow on Thursday for talks on Idlib.The Greek coast guard said 48 migrants on a dinghy heading to the island of Lesbos, accompanied by a Turkish patrol vessel while in Turkish waters, deliberately overturned their boat once in Greek waters, triggering a rescue operation Monday morning.The coast guard said they rescued the migrants, including two children who were hospitalized, one of them unconscious. Resuscitation efforts on the unconscious child, a boy aged around 6 or 7, failed, the coast guard said. The other child was considered out of danger. Their nationality was not immediately available.Greek authorities said that in the 24 hours from 6 a.m. local time Sunday, they thwarted 9,877 attempts to cross the northwestern land border, either through the fence or across the Evros River, which runs along the frontier. Authorities arrested 68 people and charged them with illegal entry.Therose Ngonda, a 40-year-old woman from Cameroon, made it into Greece by wading across the river.Speaking in the morning, her feet still wet from the river crossing, she said she had been told migrants had 72 hours from Friday to leave Turkey. She got on one of dozens of buses and minibuses that have been ferrying people from Istanbul to the border, among about 2,000 people, including Syrians and families with young children.Ngonda said she was put into the river on the Turkish side of the border. “They told me ‘go that way’.”Greece says it is faced with what has all the markings of an organized campaign by Ankara to push people through its borders. The government has sent Greek army and police reinforcements to the land border with Turkey, saying it was suspending all asylum applications for a month and would return those entering the country illegally without registering them.The army announced a 24-hour live-fire exercise along the border for Monday, declaring the area dangerous and banning any movement of people or livestock during the exercise.Police said migrants were concentrated at 10 parts of the border Monday morning, after a relatively quiet night. Over the weekend, Greek authorities used tear gas, water cannon and stun grenades to push back efforts by the crowd to push through the border. They also said Turkey had fired tear gas at Greek authorities on the Greek side.Afghan university student Karimi Khalmahammad, 22, also managed to make it across. He said he had spent time inside a Taliban prison in Afghanistan and now hoped to make it to Germany.But many of the new arrivals were being picked up by Greek authorities after crossing and were being driven away in white vans.Greek islands near the Turkish coast also saw a major increase in arrivals from Turkey. The coast guard said that in the 24 hours until Monday morning, 977 people had reached the islands in dinghies, most of them on Lesbos but also on Chios, Samos and some of the smaller islands.On Lesbos, local anger at the migration situation boiled over, with some residents preventing people, including young children and babies, from disembarking from a dinghy that reached a small harbor. Elsewhere on the island, they prevented buses from taking new arrivals to Lesbos’ massively overcrowded migrant camp of Moria.The new arrivals spent the night on the beach, where they remained on Monday morning. Those arriving near the island’s main town of Mytilene were being taken to the island’s main port for processing there in makeshift facilities instead of Moria.Turkey’s communications director, Fahrettin Altun, said Sunday the fighting in Idlib was directly linked to Turkey’s decision to open the gates for refugees to Europe. He said Ankara had changed its focus to preparing for the possibility of new arrivals from Syria “instead of preventing refugees who intend to migrate to Europe.”Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov was heading to Ankara on Monday to discuss the migrant situation with Erdogan. He said a new migrant wave would threaten stability as Europe struggles to deal with the new coronavirus.Bulgaria has deployed additional national guard and border police on it 250-km (155-mile) long border with Turkey to stave off a possible migrant influx. Defense Minister Krasimir Karakachanov said so far there in no direct migrant pressure from Turkey but 400 troops are ready to be deployed immediately at the border in case of attempted illegal border crossings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/child-dies-as-migrants-rush-to-cross-greek-turkish-border/story-IvORCRm81chWmhgD2fxjXM.html
02-03-2020||World||South Korea’s Shincheonji sect leader apologises over coronavirus spread||The elderly leader of a secretive South Korean sect linked to more than half the country’s 4,000-plus coronavirus cases knelt before the cameras Monday to apologise for the spread of the disease.Shincheonji head Lee Man-hee’s plea for forgiveness came after Seoul city authorities filed a murder complaint against him for failing to cooperate in containing the epidemic. South Korea’s case numbers -- the largest total anywhere outside China -- are expected to rise further as authorities carry out checks on more than 266,000 people associated with the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, which is often condemned as a cult.“I would like to offer my sincere apology to the people,” said Lee, his voice breaking.“Although it was not intentional, many people have been infected,” the 88-year-old said, twice bowing his head to the floor before reporters in Gapyeong. “I seek the forgiveness of the people.”“I am very thankful to the government for its efforts,” he added. “I also seek the forgiveness of the government.”Lee is revered by his followers as the “Promised Pastor” who has taken on the mantle of Jesus Christ and will take 144,000 people with him to heaven on the Day of Judgement, which he will usher in within his own lifetime.A 61-year-old female member developed a fever on February 10 but attended at least four services in Daegu -- the country’s fourth-largest city with a population of 2.5 million and the centre of the outbreak -- before being diagnosed.At worship Shincheonji members sit close together on the floor and pray extensively in what critics say creates an ideal environment to spread viral infections.Lee -- whose organisation says he has tested negative for the virus -- insisted that the group was “actively cooperating with the government”. “At churches, the leader of the church is like a parent and its members are the children,” he said, pausing occasionally to wipe tears from his eyes as protesters shouted abuse. “What parent would stand by and watch when there is such a scary disease that could even lead to death? Wouldn’t they try to fix it?” ‘Explosive rise’ Seoul’s city government has asked prosecutors to press charges including homicide against Lee and 11 other leaders after the sect was accused of submitting false lists of its members to authorities.For its part, the group says members face social stigma and discrimination if their beliefs become publicly known, dissuading some from responding to official inquiries.Prosecutors have assigned the Seoul City request for investigation, Yonhap news agency reported.Seoul mayor Park Won-soon added on his Facebook page: “If they had actively taken early measures, we could have prevented the explosive rise of COVID-19 cases in Daegu and North Gyeongbuk province and the deaths of several people.”South Korea confirmed 599 new coronavirus cases Monday, taking the total to 4,335, health authorities said, while the death toll rose to 26.Around 60 percent of the infections are linked to Shincheonji.The country’s central bank has warned of a contraction in the world’s 12th-largest economy in the first quarter, noting the epidemic will hit both consumption and exports.Scores of events have been cancelled or postponed over the contagion and the education ministry said school and kindergarten breaks, which had already been extended nationwide to next Monday, will be lengthened by a further two weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korean-sect-leader-apologises-over-coronavirus-spread/story-uQXmKek3OEWWvHU89YmXkJ.html
02-03-2020||World||China using visas as weapons against journalists: Chinese foreign press corp||China is preparing to expel more foreign journalists, a Beijing-based press group said on Monday, adding that the Chinese government is using “visas” as weapons to intimidate journalists from abroad “like never before”.The China story has only one narrative, and that’s the Chinese government’s narrative, the report said.The Foreign Correspondents’ Club of China (FCCC) annual report was released Monday in the backdrop of the unprecedented expulsion of three reporters from The Wall Street Journal over what it deemed a racist headline for an opinion piece they did not write.“In February 2020, visas and press credentials for an additional three foreign correspondents – the Wall Street Journal’s Josh Chin, Chao Deng and Philip Wen – were revoked in the biggest group expulsion in three decades,” the report said.“This amounts to the most brazen attempt in the post-Mao Zedong era to influence foreign news organizations and punish those whose work the Chinese government deems unacceptable. Since 2013, when Xi Jinping’s ascension to power was completed, China has forced out nine foreign journalists, either through outright expulsion or by non-renewal of visas,” the report added.In 2019, at least 12 correspondents received credentials valid for six months or less, more than double the five short-term visas issued the year prior.“Resident journalist visas are typically issued for one year. Outlets affected include the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, BBC, Telegraph, Globe and Mail, Le Monde, Sankei Shimbun and the Voice of America,” the report said.Local Chinese employees in foreign media are not spared, the report indicated.“Chinese employees at international media organisations – who do a variety of demanding and important work – continued to face intensifying intimidation and harassment, including being detained, interrogated and threatened,” the report added.This report, FCCC said was based on a survey of journalists who belong to the group. Conducted in December 2019, 114 of 186 correspondent members representing news organizations from 25 countries and regions responded to the survey.“Pressure on foreign journalists extends to their home offices, as Chinese diplomats stationed abroad regularly seek to influence editors and demand coverage from correspondents that fits with the tone and content of state-controlled media,” the FCCC said.“The influence and pressure brought to bear on foreign journalists in China reflects how Chinese authorities extend their reach and scope in chilling ways to ensure the “China story” has but one narrative – theirs,” the report said.The Chinese foreign ministry dismissed the FCCC report.“I must stress that we have never recognised this institution you mentioned. So, I think it is very inappropriate… for this so called organisation to say these things. We always welcome foreign media to cover news in China in an objective manner and we provide support and convenience for them, and which is witnessed by all,” foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian said at the regular ministry briefing on Monday.“What happened to WSJ journalists is just an individual case. There are over 600 journalists stationed in China. They don’t need to worry about their reporting in china as long as they observe Chinese laws and regulations,” Zhao said.“In the meantime, the foreign correspondents in China should observe locals and regulations and their professional ethics, which is the same in every country,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-using-visas-as-weapons-against-journos-says-china-s-foreign-press-corp/story-8HveuU2y5mca5wJK9XPPFI.html

02-03-2020||World||Pete Buttigieg Drops Out of the US Democratic presidential race||Pete Buttigieg, a little known politician whose strange and seemingly unpronounceable name became his best asset initially, suspended his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination Sunday, ending a historic first real shot at the coveted job by on openly gay man or woman.Buttigieg, the two-term mayor of Indiana’s South Bend city, became the second Democrat running for the party’s presidential nomination to drop out of the race after a blow-out performance from former Vice-President Joe Biden in the South Carolina on Saturday with an emphatic win that’s overhauling the race.Tom Steyer, a California billionaire who sank millions in the South Carolina race in the hope of a breakout reversal of fortunes, suspended his campaign shortly after it became cleat Saturday he did not have a path to the nomination. Buttigieg followed hours after, and more expected.Buttigieg (who family came from Malta, where there are many more Buttigiegs) won the Iowa caucuses — tied it with Senator Bernie Sanders, but both have claimed it as their victory — and narrowly lost the New Hampshire primary. He finished third in Nevada and fourth in South Carolina, which voted Saturday. This is a much better score than that of some still in the race.Buttigieg’s withdrawal is being seen as part of a larger attempt to consolidate the Democratic party’s moderates to stop Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who is making a second bid to win the Democratic party’s presidential nomination after losing to Hillary Clinton in 2016, a possibility that scares Democrats.Buttigieg did not endorse anyone in his speech announcing the suspension of his campaign, but experts and pundits expect Buttigieg’s supporters to transfer their backing to Biden, a moderate like them, in an evolving consolidation of party moderates, to stop Sanders’s insurgent campaign.Sanders’s rise as the frontrunner has worried Democratic party leaders who fear his brand of progressive political positions could not only imperil his chances of winning the White house if he was nominated, but also those of Democrats running for the House of Representatives and the Senate.All eyes are now on the March 3 Super Tuesday nominating contests in 14 states, including Democratic strongholds California and New York, when 34% of the party’s 3,900 pledged delegates will be up for grabs, in a contest that appears to be moving towards a race that will be settled bu delegates at the party’s convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in July.Biden had entered the race as a frontrunner, given his experience serving as two-term vice-president with President Barack Obama, who remains extremely popular in the Democratic party. Biden has aggressively sought his former boss’s mantle, but has failed to make a convincing case, not yet at least.But his surge from South Carolina, where African-Americans dominate the Democratic party, has raised expectations of a resurgent campaign with more energy — Biden looked charged up at his victory speech Saturday night — and more money, a big spin-off.Buttigieg’s exit will put pressure on the remaining moderates int he fray — Senator Amy Klobuchar and billionaire Michael Bloomberg — to announce their intentions to continue, or drop out before, the Super Tuesday voting to consolidate moderate voters.Senator Elizabeth Warren has performed poorly in the nominating contests thus far, despite stellar debate-night turnouts. Her long-shot candidacy has appeared in peril in recent days. Her votes will most likely migrate to Sanders, a fellow progressive, if she stepped down.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pete-buttigieg-drops-out-of-the-us-democratic-presidential-race/story-Ke15iBxu5digdBRhIJdWzL.html
02-03-2020||World||Chinese man sentenced to death for virus checkpoint killing||A Chinese court has sentenced a man to death for fatally stabbing two officials at a checkpoint set up to control the spread of the new coronavirus outbreak.The virus has infected more than 80,000 people and killed nearly 3,000 in mainland China -- prompting a wide network of temperature checks, travel restrictions, residential checks and closures nationwide.Many villages and communities have also implemented their own blockades and tough measures to keep people out, fearful that travellers could infect their communities.On Sunday a court handed down a death sentence to a 23-year-old man after he stabbed two officials at one local village checkpoint.The incident happened on February 6 when Ma Jianguo was driving a minivan through a checkpoint at Luo Meng village in Honghe, southwestern Yunnan province, where he was stopped.After Ma refused to cooperate with officials, his passenger began trying to remove the roadblock, the court said, and the local official started filming Ma and the other man on his mobile phone.A furious Ma stabbed the official -- a local poverty alleviation cadre -- in the chest and abdomen with a knife he carried with him and then attacked another official who came to the victim’s aid.The two men died from their wounds.The court statement said that although Ma had “voluntarily surrendered and truthfully confessed”, the killings were “extremely vicious”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-man-sentenced-to-death-for-virus-checkpoint-killing/story-op5Sng36CfN5QgazcSdLLP.html

The victim was in stable condition at a nearby hospital.Zamora said a negotiator was trying to talk to the gunman — a disgruntled former security guard at the shopping complex — inside a mall administration office.“He felt bad because he was removed as a guard,” Zamora told reporters, adding that the man tried but failed to convince fellow guards to join him.The man demanded to talk to fellow guards and the media, Zamora said, but it was not clear if officials would agree to those conditions.More than a dozen SWAT commandos were earlier seen entering the mall, their assault rifles ready.

The team’s study on the disease in China based on a dataset of 1099 Covid-19 patients from 552 hospitals during the first two months of the outbreak.It was published in the prestigious medical journal, The New England Journal of Medicine.Zhong and his team calculated the data after removing the extreme cases of incubation: Two patients from the sample were found with an incubation period of as long as 24 days, and for those living in Wuhan, Hubei Province for a long time or in contact with Wuhan residents, the incubation period was usually zero days. The study found that the most common symptoms were fever (43.8 per cent on admission and 88.7 per cent during hospitalisation) and cough (67.8 per cent).Among the patients included in the study more than 23 per cent had at least one coexisting illness like hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-than-2900-dead-as-china-gears-up-for-imported-covid-19-cases/story-Yh9APB9LKZxULA830THjYL.html
02-03-2020||World||North Korea launched unidentified projectile, says South Korea||North Korea fired two unidentified projectiles from a coastal area Monday as it resumed weapons demonstrations following a months-long hiatus.The launches came two days after North Korea’s state media said leader Kim Jong Un supervised an artillery drill aimed at testing the combat readiness of units in front-line and eastern areas.Seoul’s Joint Chiefs of Staff confirmed the launches in a statement but couldn’t immediately confirm how far the projectiles flew or whether the weapons were ballistic or rocket artillery.During a key ruling party meeting in late December, Kim expressed deep frustration over deadlocked diplomacy with the United States and said he won’t denuclearize if the U.S. persists with its hostile policy on his country. He also said he would unveil a new “strategic weapon” soon and no longer be bound by a self-imposed weapons test moratorium that coincided with his diplomacy with Trump.Nuclear diplomacy between North Korea and the U.S. has largely stalled since the breakdown of Kim’s second summit with Trump in February 2019 in Vietnam. That summit collapsed because Trump rejected Kim’s demands for broad sanctions relief in return for dismantling his main nuclear complex, a limited disarmament step. Subsequent talks between Pyongyang and Washington reported little progress.After the failed Hanoi summit, North Korea carried out a slew of short-range missile and other weapons tests. Trump downplayed them saying there were short-range weapons that didn’t pose a direct threat to the U.S. mainland.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-launched-unidentified-projectile-says-south-korea/story-B1e7QKD81wZJxXioqLTOgN.html
02-03-2020||World||Pete Buttigieg quits campaign, fellow Democrat Joe Biden back in US presidential race||Pete Buttigieg, the first openly gay prominent US presidential candidate, on Sunday ended his campaign to be the Democratic nominee -- giving a major boost to fellow centrist Joe Biden.The 38-year-old Buttigieg’s surprise decision was set to shake up the race this coming week when 14 states vote on “Super Tuesday.”It is expected to further boost the fortunes of Biden after the former vice president scored a resounding victory in South Carolina’s primary on Saturday in the contest to see who faces President Donald Trump in November.Biden has emerged as the chief moderate challenger to front runner Bernie Sanders, the firebrand leftist who has taken the race by storm and is looking to score big wins on Tuesday in states like crown jewel California.Buttigieg, a military veteran and former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, addressed supporters in his home town.“The truth is that the path has narrowed to a close -- for our candidacy, if not for our cause,” he said.Buttigieg did not mention Sanders by name in his speech, but he has publicly stated he believes the 78-year-old senator’s “inflexible” political approach would fail in a match-up against Trump.“We need a broad-based agenda that can truly deliver for the American people, not one that gets lost in ideology,” he said, telegraphing in a way his opposition to a Sanders nomination. Buttigieg however stopped short of endorsing Biden or any other candidate.Buttigieg emerged as a major player by narrowly winning the Iowa caucuses, earning widespread attention for his unflustered and professional approach in an often bitter Democratic nomination battle.But his third place finish in Nevada and a worse showing in South Carolina confirmed he struggled to build a broad coalition, including support from black voters -- a key Democratic demographic.Biden’s resounding victory Saturday in the first southern state to vote has thrust him back into contention, after miserable showings in the first three states.With 48 percent of the vote in South Carolina, Biden more than doubled the 20 percent won by Sanders -- positioning him as the leftist senator’s main rival.“This is a big boost for us,” Biden said Sunday on CNN, but “we have a long way to go.”Sanders continues to hold poll leads in several Super Tuesday states -- including California.“I think we’ve got a great chance to win in California, in Texas, in Massachusetts and a number of states,” Sanders said Sunday on CBS.But into an already turbulent Democratic race -- which has gradually winnowed down a diverse and record-large field -- Biden’s victory Saturday injected further uncertainty.“The biggest question is whether this will slingshot Joe Biden into victory in some Super Tuesday states,” said Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia.The win, powered by support from black voters, was Biden’s first in the race, but came at a crucial time, helping dispel doubts about the 77-year-old’s energy level and appeal.- Pressure to drop out -South Carolina brought some clarity: billionaire businessman Tom Steyer, who spent $23 million campaigning in the state, also dropped out of the race after taking just 11 percent of the vote.Pressure is mounting on other trailing Democrats -- including Senator Elizabeth Warren and Senator Amy Klobuchar -- to follow Steyer’s and Buttigieg’s example and then swiftly throw their weight behind a frontrunner.Warren, Klobuchar and billionaire Michael Bloomberg have all made it clear that they will stick around at least through Super Tuesday.Buttigieg was feted by rivals including Bloomberg, another moderate, who has poured a staggering $500 million from his personal fortune into campaign advertising.Buttigieg “ran a strong campaign that inspired audiences and made history,” Bloomberg said, adding he “deeply” admired his dedication to serving the United States.Biden praised Buttigieg for his “trail-blazing campaign based on courage, compassion, and honesty.”Many Buttigieg supporters are unlikely to shift their backing to Bloomberg, whom Buttigieg has openly accused of trying to “buy” his way into the presidential race. - The money factor -As the race goes forward, money will loom ever larger.Biden claimed he had been outspent 40-to-1 in South Carolina, but said his victory there brought in an infusion of $5 million in overnight donations.Sanders has raised huge amounts in mostly small donations, including $46 million in February alone. Biden argued on Sunday that as a centrist, he would be far more effective atop the party’s ticket in November against Trump than Sanders, who calls himself a democratic socialist.“I can bring along Democratic victory up and down the ticket,” Biden said on ABC. “I can win the United States Senate. I can keep the House.”Biden campaigns on Monday in Texas, Super Tuesday’s second largest haul of the delegates who formally pick the party’s nominee in July, while Sanders campaigns in Utah and in Klobuchar’s home state of Minnesota.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pete-buttigieg-quits-campaign-fellow-democrat-joe-biden-back-in-us-presidential-race/story-32RjMKG7Kscx5fdo86gxaI.html
02-03-2020||World||British PM Boris Johnson backs ‘fantastic’ Priti Patel amid bullying row||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said Priti Patel is a “fantastic” home secretary as he backed his senior cabinet minister amid a row over the resignation of her top civil servant.Johnson was asked about the controversy and allegations of bullying against the Indian-origin minister by Sir Philip Rutnam, her former permanent secretary, during a visit to Public Health England in north London on Sunday evening to address the rising fears around the spread of the coronavirus in Britain.“Absolutely,” he said, when asked if he had confidence in Patel.“I think she is a fantastic home secretary. Anybody who has been home secretary will testify that it is one of the toughest jobs in the government,” the prime minister said.In the context of what is being pegged as a clash between politicians and the civil service, Johnson also expressed his “admiration” for the country’s civil servants, whom he described as “brilliant alpha minds”.“There is a big, big task ahead of us now. We are delivering, at last, a new immigration system for this country, a points-based immigration system,” he said in reference to the new visa regime unveiled by Patel last month.Johnson’s intervention came following the explosive resignation of Rutnam from the UK Home Office over the weekend. While Patel herself is yet to comment on the matter, one of her cabinet colleagues, Health Secretary Matt Hancock, spoke out in her defence on Sunday.“Priti is a very determined person but she is also very courteous,” he said.Meanwhile, the opposition Labour Party has demanded that Patel address Parliament on the allegations of bullying against her.“The home secretary has a duty to come to Parliament on Monday to explain the allegations made about her own conduct,” said Sir Kier Starmer, the frontrunner in the ongoing Labour Party leadership contest to replace Jeremy Corbyn.The 47-year-old minister also faces the prospect of an inquiry, following Rutnam’s decision to sue the government over his alleged forced exit, and Starmer called for the head of the UK civil service, Cabinet Secretary Mark Sedwill, to start “an immediate investigation” into the circumstances surrounding his departure.“There are now urgent questions that must be answered and steps that need to be taken,” he said.Rutnam announced his resignation in an emotional television statement as he claimed a “vicious and orchestrated campaign” against him and pointed the finger of blame at Patel.“The home secretary categorically denied any involvement in this campaign to the Cabinet Office. I regret I do not believe her,” said Rutnam, who has said he intended to go to court with “very strong grounds” to claim a constructive, unfair dismissal.Rutnam also referred to the tensions with Patel when he encouraged her to change her behaviour.“I have received allegations that her conduct has included shouting and swearing, belittling people, making unreasonable and repeated demands, behaviour that created fear and needed some bravery to call out,” he claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-pm-boris-johnson-backs-fantastic-priti-patel-amid-bullying-row/story-SoIZaZuZ3lj92O3ZuFzQwM.html
02-03-2020||World||Coughing Pope pulls out of spiritual retreat amid Italy’s coronavirus alarm||A coughing Pope Francis told pilgrims gathered for the traditional Sunday blessing that he is cancelling his participation at a week-long spiritual retreat in the Roman countryside because of a cold.It is the first time in his seven-year papacy that he has missed the spiritual exercises that he initiated early in his pontificate to mark the start of each Lenten season.Such retreats are typical Jesuits, an order to which he belongs.The 83-year-old pontiff, who lost part of a lung to a respiratory illness as a young man, has cancelled several official engagements this week as he battled an apparent cold.His weekly appearance Sunday to pilgrims from a window high above St. Peter’s Square was the first time he has been seen publicly since Ash Wednesday, when he was seen coughing and blowing his nose during Mass.Francis paused twice to cough Sunday while addressing the faithful. At the end, he asked for prayers for the spiritual retreat, adding “unfortunately a cold prevents me from participating this year. I will be following the meditation from here.” Earlier this week, the pope cancelled two planned official audiences — formal affairs in the Apostolic Palace where Francis would have delivered a speech and greeted a great number of people at the end.Those were to include an audience with an international bioethics organization and with members of the scandal-marred Legion of Christ religious order.Francis has never previously cancelled so many official audiences or events in his papacy. He was, however, continuing to work from his residence at the Vatican’s Santa Marta hotel and was receiving people in private, the Vatican press office said.On Saturday, those private meetings were with the head of the Vatican’s bishops’ office, Francis’ ambassadors to Lebanon and France and a Ukrainian archbishop. He was to have left Sunday for the retreat outside of Rome.The Vatican has described Francis condition as “a slight illness,” without giving other details.Francis’ illness, though, has come amid general alarm in Italy over the coronavirus outbreak, which has infected more than 1,100 people, mostly in northern Italy.There have been just six cases reported in Lazio, where Rome is located, to date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coughing-pope-pulls-out-of-spiritual-retreat-amid-italy-s-coronavirus-alarm/story-8xkIJrmh8HwpR02W1DFJYP.html
02-03-2020||World||First coronavirus deaths in Australia, Thailand||Australia and Thailand reported their first fatalities from the novel coronavirus infection on Sunday as the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that the window to contain the epidemic, which has killed 2,990 and affected over 87,000 people globally since its outbreak in China in December, was narrowing.A 35-year-old Thai retail worker, who also had dengue fever, died from the infection in a Bangkok suburb, in the country’s first death from the disease, officially called Covid-19.In Australia, a 78-year-old man who was evacuated from the virus-stricken Diamond Princess cruise liner in Japan died at a Perth hospital on Sunday, local officials said. The deaths came a day after the US recorded its first fatality: a man in his 50s in Washington state. President Donald Trump announced more aggressive screening of travellers bound for the US in a tweet on Sunday. “In addition to screening travelers ‘prior to boarding’ from certain designated high risk countries, or areas within those countries, they will also be screened when they arrive in America.”China on Sunday reported a slight uptick in new cases over the past 24 hours to 573, the first time in five days that the number exceeded 500. They remain almost entirely confined to the hardest-hit province of Hubei and its capital Wuhan – the epicentre of the outbreak. Chinese officials, however, reiterated that efforts to curb the outbreak are achieving positive results, with the number of daily new cases trending lower in recent weeks.South Korea – which has the second largest number of infections outside mainland China --reported 210 additional cases and two more deaths from the virus, raising its total to 3,736 cases and 20 fatalities. Authorities in the country scrambled to rein in public gatherings in the country while many churches remained closed, holding online services instead.Iran’s death toll from Covid-19 climbed to 54 as the number of confirmed cases jumped overnight by more than half, to 978 people. The new figures represent 11 more deaths than reported a day before.Italy is suffering the worst outbreak of the virus in Europe, registering more than 1,100 confirmed cases since the contagion came to light on February 20. There have been 29 confirmed deaths and 105 people were receiving intensive care treatment in hospital - all of them in three adjacent northern regions near the business hub of Milan.On Sunday, the Vatican quickly shot down speculation that the Pope himself had come down with Covid-19 after he was seen coughing a couple of times during his weekly Sunday appearance.The spread of the virus also shut down France’s iconic Louvre Museum on Sunday, with workers who guard its famous trove of artworks fearful of being contaminated by the flow of visitors from around the world.The chief of WHO Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in Riyadh on Sunday that the window is narrowing to contain the outbreak, but while countries need to prepare for a pandemic, facts show there’s no such threat yet.“We shouldn’t abandon the containment strategy because we see it’s working in some countries,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-coronavirus-deaths-in-australia-thailand/story-XtjNooTouFpqOWn5fCgI7O.html
02-03-2020||World||Pakistan to request British govt for Sharif’s deportation||Pakistan has announced that it will request the British government to deport former prime minister Nawaz Sharif as he is an “absconder”.“The government has decided in principle to write a letter this week to the British government, seeking deportation of PML-N supreme leader Nawaz Sharif, as he is an absconder not fulfilling the terms and conditions of the bail granted to him on medical grounds,” Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Information Firdous Ashiq Awan told a press conference here on Sunday evening.She said Sharif had gone to London on November 19 last year for his treatment but was yet to be admitted to a hospital there, indicating that “it was a fixed match played by him, his party and a section of the media on his health”, paving the way for his departure to London.Awan claimed that Sharif and his younger brother Shahbaz had gone to London to protect the businesses of their children.“Nawaz faked his health condition,” she alleged.Last week, the Punjab government had refused to extend Sharif’s bail, declaring that it had found no “legal, moral or medical ground” necessitating an extension in his stay abroad.The Lahore High Court had, in October last year, granted bail to Sharif on medical grounds for four weeks, allowing the Punjab government to extend it further in the light of his medical reports.The Islamabad High Court had also granted bail to Sharif in the Al Azizia Mills corruption case, in which the former prime minister was serving a seven-year jail term, clearing his way to travel abroad for medical treatment.PML-N secretary general Ahsan Iqbal said if Sharif decided to return to the country, the Imran Khan government will request him not to come.He said the three-time premier will challenge the government’s decision not to give him extension in his stay abroad in the court shortly.PML-N Punjab information secretary Azma Bokhari told PTI that if Pakistan wrote to the British government for Sharif’s deportation, the PML-N would also write to the US government seeking opening of a case against Prime Minister Imran Khan regarding his (”illegitimate”) child.She said Sharif was seriously ill and had heart-related complications, adding that the former prime minister was going to have a heart procedure shortly.“Imran Khan and his team should stop playing on the health of Sharif and concentrate on governance matters instead,” Bokhari said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-to-request-british-govt-for-sharif-s-deportation/story-zhAkXtS0GXMxf61dVmqtUM.html
02-03-2020||World||Coronavirus spreads to over 60 countries, global toll reaches 3,000||Coronavirus cases surged in Italy, and France closed the world-famous Louvre Museum on Sunday as the deadly outbreak that began in China sent fear rising across Western Europe, threatening its tourism industry.The number of countries hit by the virus climbed past 60, and the death toll worldwide reached at least 3,000.New fronts in the battle opened rapidly over the weekend, deepening the sense of crisis that has already sent financial markets plummeting, emptied the streets in many cities and rewritten the routines of millions of people. More than 88,000 around the globe have been infected, with the virus popping up on every continent but Antarctica.Australia and Thailand reported their first deaths Sunday, while the Dominican Republic and the Czech Republic recorded their first infections.Italian authorities announced that the number of people infected in the country soared 50% to 1,694 in just 24 hours, and five more had died, bringing the death toll there to 34. France raised its number of reported cases to 130, an increase of 30 from the day before, and said it has seen two deaths.The U.S. government advised Americans against traveling to the two northern Italian regions hit hardest, among them Lombardy, which includes Milan. Major American airlines began suspending flights to Milan.The travel restrictions against Italy and the rising alarm in France could deal a heavy blow to the countries’ tourism industries. Spring, especially Easter, is a hugely popular time for schoolchildren to visit France and Italy.“We had already registered a slowdown of Americans coming to Italy in recent days,” Bernabo Bocca, president of Italy’s hotel association, said in a statement Saturday. “Now, the final blow has arrived.”Tourism accounts for 13% of the economy in Italy, with its world-class art museums, archaeological sites and architectural treasures. More than 5.6 million Americans visit Italy every year, representing 9% of foreign tourists.Iran, Iraq and South Korea, among other places, also saw the number of infections rise. Cases in the U.S. climbed to at least 74 with the first death in the United States reported on Saturday — a man in his 50s in Washington state who had underlying health problems but hadn’t traveled to any affected areas.Panic-buying of daily necessities emerged in Japan, where professional baseball teams have played spring-training games in deserted stadiums. Tourist attractions across Asia, Europe and the Mideast were deserted. Islam’s holiest sites have been closed to foreign pilgrims. And governments have closed schools and banned big gatherings.The United Nations said Sunday it is releasing $15 million from an emergency fund to help countries with fragile health systems contain the virus.“We must act now to stop this virus from putting more lives at risk,” U.N. humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock said. The aid “has the potential to save the lives of millions of vulnerable people.”In France, the archbishop of Paris told parish priests to put the Communion bread in worshippers’ hands, not in their mouths. French officials also advised people to forgo the customary kisses on the cheek upon greeting others.The Louvre, home of the “Mona Lisa” and other priceless artworks, closed after workers expressed fear of being contaminated by the stream of visitors from around the world. Staffers were also concerned about museum workers from Italy who had come to the Louvre to collect works by Leonardo da Vinci that were loaned for an exhibition.The Louvre, the world’s most popular museum, received 9.6 million visitors last year, almost three-quarters of them from abroad.“We are very worried because we have visitors from everywhere,” said Andre Sacristin, a Louvre employee and union representative. “The risk is very, very, very great.” While there are no known infections among the museum’s 2,300 workers, “it’s only a question of time,” he said.The shutdown followed a government decision Saturday to ban indoor public gatherings of more than 5,000 people.Among the frustrated visitors was Charles Lim from Singapore. He and his wife, Jeanette, chose Paris to celebrate their first wedding anniversary and bought tickets in advance for the Louvre.“We waited for about three hours before giving up,” he said. “It was incredibly disappointing.”China, where the outbreak began two months ago, on Sunday reported a slight uptick in new cases over the past 24 hours to 573, the first time in five days that the number exceeded 500. They remain almost entirely confined to the hardest-hit province of Hubei and its capital, Wuhan.South Korea reported 210 additional cases and two more deaths, raising its totals to 3,736 cases and 20 fatalities. South Korea has the second-largest number of infections outside China, with most of the cases in the southeastern city of Daegu and nearby areas.South Korea’s president used a speech marking the 101st anniversary of an anti-Japanese independence uprising to call for national unity to overcome the crisis.Iran’s death toll climbed to 54 as the number of confirmed cases jumped overnight by more than half, to 978. The new figures represent 11 more deaths than reported on Saturday.Around the world, many cases of the virus have been relatively mild, and some of those infected apparently show no symptoms at all.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-spreads-to-over-60-countries-france-closes-louvre-for-visitors/story-FhvFSSgFvVaziH2sVHkdYN.html
