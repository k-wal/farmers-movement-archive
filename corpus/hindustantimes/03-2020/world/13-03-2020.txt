13-03-2020||World||Canadian Parliament shuts until April 20 due to coronavirus outbreak||Canada’s Parliament agreed Friday to shut down for more than a month while Prime Minister Justin Trudeau governed remotely from his home, in self-imposed quarantine after his wife tested positive for the new coronavirusCanada’s House of Commons voted to shut down for at least five weeks to help ensure lawmakers do not contribute to the spread of the virus.The moves a day after Trudeau’s wife tested positive. The prime minister himself has been in self-imposed quarantine.All parties in Parliament agreed to the suspension, which means lawmakers will miss two weeks of sessions since they had previously planned to be away next week and two weeks in April. The House is scheduled to next meet Monday, April 20.Government House leader Pablo Rodriguez said the House of Commons could come back sooner if an emergency requires a meeting.Trudeau was quarantining himself at home because his wife Sophie Grégoire Trudeau tested positive for the new coronavirus after returning from Britain. He said Friday his wife has mild flu-like symptoms but is doing fine. He said neither he nor their three children are showing symptoms.“She’s getting lots of rest and drinking lots of fluids and we’re paying very close attention to what the medical professionals are saying,” Trudeau said to the CBC.“I am feeling fine, no symptoms. The kids are all fine, happy to being staying home from school. We’re doing well.”Trudeau was spending the day in briefings, phone calls and virtual meetings from home, including speaking with other world leaders and joining a special Cabinet committee discussion of the coronavirus. Trudeau spoke with U.S. President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Thursday.But Trudeau did cancel an in-person meeting with Canada’s provincial premiers.The prime minister will address the nation later in the day, according to his office.Trudeau himself had not been tested because he was not showing symptoms, his office said. The doctor’s advice to the prime minister is to continue daily activities while self-monitoring.Trudeau said his government will likely recommend that Canadians avoid travel outside the country except for essential purposes.“We are going to be able to get through this if everyone is going to follow the advice of our medical professionals and experts,” Trudeau said to CBC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-parliament-shuts-until-april-20-due-to-coronavirus-outbreak/story-T8hJUuPj71GhywDHRlWhLP.html

13-03-2020||World||US markets claw back from worst meltdown since 1987||U.S. stocks rebounded from the worst day since 1987 amid signs policy makers around the world are taking action to stave off the economic fallout from the coronavirus. Oil jumped.The S&P 500 surged 5.6% at the open after plunging 9.5% Thursday in the biggest rout since 1987 and fifth worst on record. European equities jumped 7%, the dollar surged and stress in the credit markets showed some signs of easing.After days of no or inadequate action, policy prescriptions came fast Friday, with reports Congress is near a deal on a spending bill. The European Union prepared to suspend government spending rules and regulators in Italy and Spain banned short-selling on some stocks. China’s central bank said it would pump in $79 billion to bolster the economy.The moves buoyed market sentiment battered by the spread of the virus and a spate of travel restrictions, school closings and event cancellations. But bears cautioned that the rebound was preordained and may not stick.After each of the 10 worst days in S&P 500 history, the average return has been a gain of 2.94%. The Cboe Volatility Index dropped after its fourth-highest close on record. Such spikes in the VIX have always been followed by sharp rallies.Other markets remained exceptionally volatile. Ten-year Treasuries swung from earlier gains to losses. Sovereign bonds sank across most of Europe for a second day amid criticism of European Central Bank measures to address the pandemic. Oil pushed higher and the dollar headed for its best week since 2016.“It’s possible we’re just recovering a portion of yesterday’s losses on the idea that there were no terrible headlines this morning,” said Susquehanna Financial Group strategist Christopher Jacobsen. “The market had priced in the extreme dour outcome and the lack of newsflow this morning to confirm that worst-case scenario resulted in just a bit of a relief rally.”Even with Friday’s gains, global equities are heading for their worst week since 2008 as investors price in a severely weaker economic outlook. They’re doubting the efficacy of policy responses as cases continue to grow across the world and restrictions on people and businesses crush sentiment. The Bank of Japan on Friday followed an earlier move from the Federal Reserve to inject liquidity.“It seems that the more severe things become in the short term, the more extreme will be the fiscal and monetary policy response,” Mark Dowding, chief investment officer at BlueBay Asset Management, wrote to investors. “It is very conceivable that the full boost from such measures will only really kick in just as activity rebounds, with pent up demand leading to a turbo-charged recovery in the second half of the year in the wake of an economic contraction in the context of the first half.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/u-s-stock-rebound-with-hopes-for-policy-responses-markets-wrap/story-FRpcDAkdqKk7Ozr74VGsFO.html

All Red Tape has been cut, ready to go!” he wrote in a tweet.Trump also criticized the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one of the U.S. organizations leading the fight against the deadly infection, for having a testing system that he said would “always be inadequate and slow for a large scale pandemic.”Trump did not elaborate on why the system was inadequate, but on Thursday, the top U.S. official on infectious diseases, Anthony Fauci, said people cannot get tests easily and the U.S. testing system “is not really geared to what we need right now.”U.S. officials and lawmakers are struggling to get a sense of how many people in the country have contracted the virus, which they attribute to low testing rates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-testing-to-happen-soon-on-large-scale-basis-donald-trump/story-gHtSo3PIhMmOufurgckLrJ.html
13-03-2020||World||WHO officials rethink epidemic messaging amid coronavirus pandemic debate||The World Health Organization is considering changing the way it classifies and describes international epidemics, amid a protracted public debate over whether to call the outbreak of the new coronavirus a pandemic.Officials at the Geneva-based WHO – who this week described it as a pandemic for the first time - are reviewing how the health agency communicates its risk assessment of disease outbreaks in the future, said two people familiar with the discussions. They said that included use of the term pandemic as well as PHEIC, which stands for public health emergency of international concern.Among ideas that have been discussed is whether to use a more graded approach to capture different levels of severity, rather than binary terminology, the two people said. That would enable the WHO to dial up the severity of its messaging to prompt global cooperation on issues such as funding and drug development across the public health and scientific community, but without causing unnecessary public alarm.WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has publicly signalled support for a more nuanced approach, saying the current system of declaring a public health emergency is too blunt. “It’s either red or green,” Tedros said during a Jan. 29 conference with news media. “I think we have to now revise that. You cannot have just yes or no. There could be some intermediate situation.” He suggested a yellow stage that could be “a warning…serious enough but not really red.”The agency’s emergency committee on the new coronavirus, which is made up of independent experts, alluded to the internal discussions the following day. In a Jan. 30 statement following a meeting at which it declared a public health emergency, the panel said it recommended that the WHO “continue to explore the advisability of creating an intermediate level of alert” between PHEIC or no PHEIC.WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris said that currently the decision on declaring a public health emergency of international concern, or PHEIC, is “binary.” She said the WHO’s emergency committee on coronavirus suggested, and the director general agreed, to meet to “review whether the existing instrument is still fit for purpose.”The discussion around the agency’s messaging on epidemics comes as it seeks to coordinate the global fight against an outbreak of infection with the newly identified coronavirus, which emerged in December. Now known as COVID-19, it has spread from China to more than 100 countries, killing thousands of people with more expected to die.While many public health experts say the WHO’s response to this epidemic has been timely and decisive, the agency has also drawn criticism from some commentators who say it has been too quick to heap praise on China – a criticism Tedros has strongly rejected, saying China’s drastic measures have slowed the virus spread and allowed other countries to prepare. The agency also came under intense media scrutiny in recent weeks as it refrained from calling the infectious disease’s spread a pandemic, even as it took grip in scores of countries around the world. When the WHO did on Wednesday describe COVID-19 as a pandemic, Director General Tedros said the agency was concerned about “the alarming levels of spread and severity” of coronavirus. While the characterisation doesn’t trigger any formal change in what the agency does or it recommends countries do, some public health experts said it might prompt governments to move more swiftly to make interventions, such as banning or restricting public gatherings or travel. GLOBAL HEALTH EMERGENCY Under the WHO’s International Health Regulations, the agency can formally declare a PHEIC (pronounced “fake”), or global health emergency, which it did with COVID-19 on Jan. 30. Such declarations are made when an epidemic meets two criteria: The outbreak poses a risk to more than one country and it requires a coordinated international response. The formal designation triggers various moves, including calls for increased funding and resources, recommendations to countries aimed at preventing or reducing cross-border spread of disease and boosting public health measures.The WHO has declared PHEICs on five previous occasions, including the West Africa Ebola outbreak starting in 2014 and the 2016 Zika virus outbreak that spread from Brazil.In 2009, the WHO declared the outbreak of H1N1 flu a pandemic. That move later drew criticism from some governments that it triggered some countries to take expensive measures, including stockpiling and prescribing anti-viral drugs and undertaking mass vaccinations against a flu that ultimately turn out to be milder than originally thought. The then-director general, Dr. Margaret Chan, has defended her decision as the “right call.”How the WHO communicates around global epidemics was under review even before the COVID-19 outbreak began in December, according to the two people familiar with the discussions.According to one of those people, the discussion was prompted in part by last year’s outbreak of Ebola in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, which the WHO declared a PHEIC in July 2019. WHO officials wanted to sound an alarm and prompt a global response in terms of funding and vaccines, but there were questions among some officials at the WHO and member states about whether it was truly an international issue because the Ebola outbreak affected only Congo and neighbouring Uganda, the person said. They added that these questions focused discussion on whether a graded approach might be more appropriate.When COVID-19 began spreading beyond China, global health officials and experts looked to the WHO to declare a PHEIC. Even after it did so in late January, the agency faced repeated questions from international media on whether or not the outbreak was a pandemic.PANDEMIC CONTROLSome WHO chiefs have expressed concern that using the label pandemic might signal to governments and the public that the coronavirus outbreak had developed to a level where there was no longer action they could take to control its spread.That was a key part of the WHO’s message when it did ultimately call the coronavirus as a pandemic. “We cannot say this loudly enough, or clearly enough, or often enough: all countries can still change the course of this pandemic. This is the first pandemic that can be controlled,” Tedros said in a tweet Wednesday.WHO officials and some global health experts said the media’s focus on the word pandemic was an unwanted distraction for them because, unlike the PHEIC classification, it doesn’t trigger specific responses within countries.“There is an unhelpful alignment in people’s minds between this ‘pandemic’ word and some sort of major shift in approach - but this is not the case,” Mike Ryan, head of WHO’s health emergencies programme, told reporters at a March 3 briefing for news media.A sign of the WHO’s frustration was visible during a news conference this week – one of around 30 hour-long briefings the WHO has held for international media since the COVID-19 outbreak began. A senior official who had been asked repeatedly by journalists about whether the disease constituted a pandemic gave a half-joking but tetchy response: “This is a word you love, right? You just can’t wait, can you?” Some specialists agree that the external focus on the label pandemic have been a distraction, including Lawrence Gostin, a global health expert at Georgetown University Law School in Washington. Gostin has been openly critical of the WHO in the past - in particular for what he considered to be moving too slowly to declare international emergencies over Ebola and Zika. With the COVID-19 outbreak, however, Gostin said the WHO was right to not describe it as a pandemic prematurely because the word tends to generate fear.Global health specialists say that more subtleties in how WHO messages around epidemics could be useful, but say they doubt it will make much practical difference.“In the end if you move from a binary to a three or four stage process, you’ll always have these semantic arguments,” said Jeremy Farrar, an expert in infectious disease epidemics and director of the Wellcome Trust global health charity. “And is there really a difference between a global epidemic and a pandemic? And does it make a difference to what we do?” he said. “I don’t think so.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-officials-rethink-epidemic-messaging-amid-coronavirus-pandemic-debate/story-aCOtlP4BZi3BqSYjnMVHcN.html
13-03-2020||World||Australian PM advices against big gatherings amid coronavirus outbreak||Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Friday urged people not to gather in groups of more than 500 from Monday but said he would still go to a weekend rugby game, as officials warned millions of residents would contract coronavirus within months.Australia has recorded 156 infections and three deaths from the flu-like disease, figures that authorities expect to increase rapidly in the coming weeks.Morrison said his government will advise against non-essential gatherings of more than 500 people from Monday, though this does not include schools, airports or public transport.“This is an early-stage action that we are undertaking to make sure we get ahead of this,” Morrison told reporters in Sydney, adding Australians should also reconsider their need for any overseas travel.The virus has so far infected almost 135,000 and killed more than 4,900 worldwide.On Friday afternoon, home affairs minister Peter Dutton said he had tested positive for the pathogen and had been hospitalised.Media representatives for Scott Morrison did not return emails seeking comment on whether the prime minister’s plans to attend the game on the weekend had changed given he met with Dutton during the week.But in a Twitter post, Morrison said he had received medical advice that said only people that were in contact with Dutton in the past 24 hours or so needed to self-isolate.“That does not include myself or any other members of the Cabinet,” Morrison said.Health officials warned that millions of Australians would contract the coronavirus within the next six months.“We’re anticipating 20% of the population in the first wave to be affected,” Kerry Chant, the chief medical officer for the New South Wales (NSW) state government.Home to more than 7 million people, NSW is Australia’s most populous state, and Chant said models suggest 5% of the state’s population - some 350,000 people - will need hospital treatment as a result of coronavirus.KEEP CALM AND CARRY ONAustralia’s ban on foreigners from arriving from China, Iran and South Korea was extended on Thursday to cover Italy, and has formed a key part of Australia’s move to stop the spread of the virus.Morrison has spent much of the past week urging locals to remain calm while trying to reassure nervous financial markets.On Thursday he said his government would inject A$17.6 billion ($11.1 billion) to spur an economy hammered by the coronavirus outbreak.But Morrison’s call for calm has largely fallen on deaf ears. Hundreds of Australians have begun stockpiling goods, from staples to sanitizers, while the country’s share market has been battered in the past week.SPORTING UPHEAVALAustralia’s updated medical advice was a key catalyst behind the cancellation of the Australian Formula One Grand Prix and an order for a cricket series between Australia and New Zealand to be played behind closed doors.Two of the sports-mad country’s most popular sports, rugby league and Australian Rules football, are beginning their seasons with games that typically draw tens of thousands of spectators, raising the risk of contagion.Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said the Australian Rules football league season may need to be suspended. The country’s biggest and best-attended football code is due to begin its season on March 19.Morrison said he would attend a weekend rugby league game to watch his favourite Cronulla Sharks team.“It might be the last game I get to go to for a long time. That’s fine. In the future I suspect we might be watching them on television.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australian-pm-advices-against-big-gatherings-amid-coronavirus-outbreak/story-KMHhbZfSWb1PLugErtggoO.html
13-03-2020||World||Australian home affairs minister says he has coronavirus||A senior Australian politician tested positive for the new coronavirus and entered hospital quarantine on Friday, days after returning from a meeting in Washington attended by US Attorney General William Barr.“This morning I woke up with a temperature and sore throat,” said Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton, an influential member of the government and a key architect of Australia’s controversial immigration laws.“It is the policy of Queensland Health that anyone who tests positive is to be admitted into hospital and I have complied with their advice.” Dutton said he feels “fine” but his diagnosis will raise concerns about whether other members of the cabinet and Prime Minister Scott Morrison may have been infected.It is not yet known when Dutton contracted the virus.He recently returned from the United States.Dutton was in Washington a week ago for a meeting with members of the FiveEyes intelligence alliance -- Australia, the United States, Britain, Canada and New Zealand.His counterparts there included US Attorney General William Barr.Australia has seen around 184 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and three fatalities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australian-home-affairs-minister-says-he-has-coronavirus/story-V5RQvynhTl7XkFULbIQGIO.html
13-03-2020||World||First coronavirus case can be traced back to Nov 17 in China’s Hubei province: Report||The first case of novel coronavirus can be traced back to November 17 last year in China’s Hubei province, which subsequently became its epicentre as it rapidly spread at home and abroad before Chinese health officials could identify the deadly virus, according to a media report on Friday. Chinese authorities have so far identified at least 266 people who were infected in 2019. All the 266 individuals came under medical surveillance at some point, Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported.The first case of someone in China suffering from COVID-19 can be traced back to November 17, the report said quoting government data. A 55-year-old from Hubei province could have been the first person to have contracted the viral infection on November 17 last year and cases rapidly began piling up since then, it said, without revealing the gender of the individual. The Hubei province is under lockdown since January 23 after it became a battleground for the novel coronavirus. The total confirmed COVID-19 cases in the hard-hit province so far is 67,786, which showed the extent of the spread of the virus in the area.Hubei’s capital Wuhan, the ground zero, has so far reported 49,991 confirmed cases, including 2,436 deaths, the local health commission said on Friday.According to the Post report, scientists have been trying to map the pattern of the early transmission of COVID-19 since an epidemic was reported in Wuhan in January, two months before the outbreak became a global health crisis. Understanding how the disease spread and determining how undetected and undocumented cases contributed to its transmission will greatly improve their understanding of the size of that threat, it said.Since November 17, one to five new coronavirus cases surfaced each day. By December 15, the total number of infections stood at 27 -- the first double-digit daily rise was reported on December 17 -- and by December 20, the total number of confirmed cases reached 60, the report said.On December 27, Zhang Jixian, a doctor from Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, told China’s health authorities that the disease was caused by a new coronavirus. By that date, over 180 people had been infected, though doctors might not have been aware of all of them at the time, the report said.By December 31, the number of confirmed cases rose to 266. On January 1, the numbers jumped to 381.Dr Li Wenliang, a 29-year-old whistle-blower who later died of COVID-19, was warned by local police when he first wrote about the virus on social media on December 31. While the government records have not been released to the public, they provide valuable clues about how the disease spread in its early days and the speed of its transmission, as well as how many confirmed cases Beijing has recorded, the report said.Scientists are now keen to identify the so-called “patient zero”, which could help them to trace the source of the coronavirus, which is generally thought to have jumped to humans from a wild animal, possibly a bat, it said.Of the first nine cases to be reported in November -- four men and five women -- none has been confirmed as being “patient zero”. They were all aged between 39 and 79, but it is not known how many were residents of Wuhan, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak.It is possible that there were reported cases dating back even earlier than those seen by the Post in the government data, it said.Interviews with whistle-blowers from the medical community suggest Chinese doctors only realised they were dealing with a new disease in late December. According to the World Health Organisation, the first confirmed COVID-19 case in China was on December 8, but the global body does not track the disease itself but relies on nations to provide such information.A report published in medical journal The Lancet by Chinese doctors from Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan, which treated some of the earliest patients, put the date of the first known infection at December 1.Dr Ai Fen, the first known whistleblower, told People magazine in an interview, which was later censored, that tests showed that a patient at Wuhan Central Hospital was diagnosed on December 16 as having contracted an unknown strain of coronavirus. Meanwhile, the total confirmed coronavirus cases in China reached 80,813 on Thursday. The number comprised 3,176 deaths, 13,526 patients undergoing treatment and 64,111 individuals discharged after recovery, China’s Health Commission said on Friday. The report tracing back the first COVID-19 case to November 17 came amid a war of words between China and the US over the origin of the virus. On Thursday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian alleged that the US army might have brought coronavirus to Wuhan, while reacting to US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Robert Redfield’s reported remarks that some flu patients may have been misdiagnosed and actually had coronavirus. Zhao tweeted, “CDC was caught on the spot. When did patient zero begin in US? How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals? It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation!” He, however, did not elaborate about his allegation against the US army.In a televised speech on Thursday, US President Donald Trump said coronavirus started in China and spread to other places.On Monday, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang condemned US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for branding the coronavirus as “Wuhan virus” and termed his remarks as “despicable behaviour” and an attempt to stigmatise the Communist country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-coronavirus-case-can-be-traced-back-to-nov-17-in-china-s-hubei-province-report/story-4tA1iCQw5o5bWL9iBRKgGO.html
13-03-2020||World||Beyond human toll, coronavirus could shake up global politics||Thousands of people have died, the US response has infuriated European allies, and China has gone on a propaganda offensive. The new coronavirus is shaping up to be a cataclysmic event with far-reaching consequences in global politics.The COVID-19 pandemic, which has infected more than 130,000 people globally, strikes a world already in flux with the rise of nationalists such as US President Donald Trump who have scoffed at the rules of the “globalist” order.“When the dust settles on the COVID-19 world, we won’t be in the same place that we were just a week ago,” said Jon Alterman, a senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.“We know that governments will shake as citizens judge them to have fumbled in their response. We know that economies will be disrupted and some economies are likely to collapse,” he said.Trump, who initially dismissed the risks of COVID-19, late Wednesday abruptly imposed a 30-day ban on most travel from mainland Europe and vowed to confront the “foreign virus”.Leaders from the European Union voiced outrage at the move, which triggered chaos at airports, and said that they had not been consulted -- which Trump acknowledged.Kelly Magsamen, the vice president for national security and international policy at the left-leaning Center for American Progress, said Trump’s move would only increase questions about Washington’s historic leadership role.“I think a lot of partners and allies are saying, can the US be relied upon to lead on major global challenges -- whether it’s a pandemic or whether it’s climate change or nonproliferation?” she said.“It’s going to have effects on other dimensions of our relationship.” COVID-19 first emerged late last year in the Chinese metropolis of Wuhan -- likely at a market that sold exotic animals for their meat -- and Beijing initially tried to suppress the news including by detaining the doctor who sounded the alarm.But China in the past week has sought to turn its COVID-19 response into a sort of soft power, with President Xi Jinping visiting Wuhan to trumpet success at containing the spread.China has sent medical equipment to Italy, the second-worst hit country, and Spain, highlighting its authoritarian model as decisive.It has also used the crisis as leverage against the United States, which has been seeking to combat Beijing’s influence in all areas.An article in the state-run Global Times unsubtly hinted that China could stop exports of face masks and other medical gear if the Trump administration keeps pressing to restrict its tech giant Huawei.China as well as Russia has also promoted unfounded conspiracy theories to discredit the United States. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian suggested on Twitter that the US military may have brought the new coronavirus to Wuhan.The Trump administration, which has offered USD 100 million in aid worldwide to help other countries deal with the pandemic, has in turn sought to associate China firmly with COVID-19.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo speaks of the illness as the “Wuhan virus” and Republican Senator Tom Cotton has vowed that the United States will “hold accountable those who inflicted it on the world.” Michael Green, who was the top Asia advisor to former president George W Bush, doubted that China would ultimately find many buyers for its “arguments about the failures of democracy.” But he added: “That does not mean that the US will win this information battle.” “While the Japanese and others in Asia are not getting the shock treatment that the Europeans got overnight, there is a very strong sense of questioning American leadership right now,” said Green, now a senior vice president at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies.In one example, Green pointed to the stalemate in talks over South Korea’s contributions to US bases, with Trump irritating the ally by insisting on much higher payments.One broader effect, Green said, may be a shifting political narrative.Xi, once seen as untouchable in China, has faced criticism as netizens cheer on doctors -- much like Americans across party lines have hailed Anthony Fauci, the 79-year-old veteran head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.Trump’s 2016 upset win, Britain’s vote to leave the European Union and other populist victories had been seen as proof “that the technocrats failed” following the Great Recession of the late 2000s and the Iraq war, Green said.“I think it’s very possible that the macro result this time could be that the political populists failed and it’s the technocrats who emerge as the heroes,” Green said.“We’ll see. But that may be how political history turns in this chapter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/when-the-dust-settles-beyond-human-toll-coronavirus-could-shake-up-global-politics/story-yUB7WOEV6KF9uLJUwh4OxO.html
13-03-2020||World||US shuts itself down to ward off coronavirus||The United States is shutting itself down to ward off the coronavirus outbreak. All major sporting events have been cancelled, Disneyland and Disney World announced they were closed and five states announced closure of their school systems on Thursday as the country girded up for the worst.On Wednesday, President Donald Trump had announced an unprecedented suspension of air travel from European countries, with the exception of the United Kingdom, shuttering America from its closest western allies, with implications for travelers headed for the US from India.On Thursday, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) cancelled the year’s college basketball championship, and it’s better known betting spinoff called March Madness; and the major hockey and soccer leagues cancelled their seasons for the year following the lead of the baseball league.“Together, we are facing a significant health crisis in our county, state and nation,” the Montgomery county public schools system of Maryland state said in a letter to parents on Thursday announcing the closure of schools from March 16 to March 27.Kentucky, Ohio, New Mexico and Michigan were the others. Many US universities have also shut down their campuses and announced plans to switch to virtual teaching when they reopen after the annual spring breaks starting next Monday.The number of Americans infected by coronavirus touched 1,600 and the stock markets plunged as the country sought to deal with growing outbreak that experts are warning will only get worse from now on, despite President Trump’s largely faltering efforts to spin the situation positively.A sense of panic has set in with large grocery chains like Costco and Walmart being run over by customers stocking up for an uncertain future.“You have enough snacks because you are going to be home for the next month,” a man asked his elementary school-age children at a Maryland Costco store.Office-goers, in government and private sector, are either preparing to start working from home or settled in already.“Teleworking,” a congressional aide said to this reporter when asked for plans for next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-shuts-itself-down-to-ward-off-coronavirus/story-umtKLLXflXc1e3TB4edPSM.html
13-03-2020||World||From cover up to lock down, how China turned the tide on the coronavirus||As the rest of the world is engulfed in the coronavirus pandemic, China says it has turned the tide against the disease that has killed thousands of people.From initial attempts to cover up the outbreak to later locking down cities and now declaring it “basically curbed”, here is a look at how China grappled with COVID-19:Mystery virusThe first case emerged in the central city of Wuhan on December 8 before several workers at Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market began to fall sick with a fever.On December 31, Wuhan health authorities announced 27 cases of suspected viral pneumonia linked to the market and notified the World Health Organization.But officials insisted there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission and that it was “preventable and controllable”.A day later, eight people were reprimanded by Wuhan police for “spreading rumours” about the then mysterious disease.There had been social media talk of a re-emergence of SARS, another coronavirus, which killed nearly 650 people in mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003.Li Wenliang, a 34-year-old ophthalmologist at Wuhan Central Hospital, was among those punished for raising the alarm.Cover-up and lockdownThe number of cases in Wuhan jumped to 44 on January 3 and health authorities in Hong Kong and Singapore issued travel alerts.China announced the existence of a “new type of coronavirus” on January 9 and the first death two days later.But between January 5 and 17 China reported no new cases of the virus, while Japan and Thailand declared their first infections.During this time, Wuhan and Hubei province pressed ahead with their annual legislative meetings despite the outbreak.Meanwhile, doctors were ordered to keep quiet about the virus and evidence of human transmission they had seen, according to an interview with Ai Fen, one of the earliest medical whistleblowers on the outbreak and a colleague of Li.An annual mass banquet for 40,000 families organised by Wuhan authorities went ahead on January 18.The same day Beijing sent a team of scientific experts to Wuhan to investigate.On January 20, President Xi Jinping ordered that the virus be “resolutely contained” in his first public comment on the issue.Human-to-human transmission was finally confirmed by a leading Chinese expert that day.This marked a major turning point in the epidemic, with 291 infections reported nationwide.Panic took hold in Wuhan, a city of 11 million, when it was abruptly placed on lockdown on January 23. The rest of Hubei province was sealed off in the following days.Wuhan hospitals, inundated with patients, reported dire shortages of medical supplies. Many who could not get timely treatment for themselves or relatives relayed personal tragedies on social media.The virus spread as hundreds of millions of people travelled across the country and abroad for the Lunar New Year holiday, before travel curbs were imposed.On January 30, the WHO declared the outbreak a “global emergency”.‘Hero’ doctor diesBetween February 1 and 7, cases in China ballooned from 11,791 to 31,161, while deaths reached 636.On February 7 the Wuhan medical whistleblower Li died from the coronavirus, triggering a wave of public grief and anger. Many grievances against the authorities were swiftly censored on social media.Days later, four high-profile local officials were purged and replaced to appease public disquiet -- including the Communist Party secretaries of Wuhan and Hubei.The province recorded a huge jump of 14,840 new infections on February 13 due to a change in diagnostic criteria, raising questions about the credibility of China’s data.Xi, usually a ubiquitous presence on state media, remained out of the spotlight.But on February 15 Beijing released a speech by Xi showing he had urged officials to contain the outbreak as early as January 7 -- well before authorities announced human-to-human transmission -- in an attempt to boost the leader’s public image.Xi tours WuhanIn late February and early March, the number of new cases in Hubei and other parts of China steadily declined as outbreaks flared up in Italy, Iran and South Korea.On March 10, Xi visited Wuhan for the first time since the outbreak began, suggesting the Communist Party was confident it had the situation under control.Wuhan officials touted the sealing off of all residential estates from February 11 as “critical” in curbing the spread in the city, although some experts believe it led to more cross-infections within households.After more than 4,600 deaths and 126,000 infections across the country, China is now trying to reshape the global narrative in response to overseas criticism, casting itself as a leader in the heroic fight against the virus while other countries struggle to cope.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/from-cover-up-to-lock-down-how-china-turned-the-tide-on-the-coronavirus/story-VxpMIZgQLgPayK5Pj0vkpN.html
13-03-2020||World||US judge orders WikiLeaks source Chelsea Manning released from prison||Former US Army soldier and WikiLeaks source Chelsea Manning was released from prison on Thursday on a judge’s order after being held since May for refusing to testify in an ongoing US investigation of WikiLeaks.US District Court Judge Anthony Trenga in Alexandria, Virginia, ordered Manning released because the grand jury hearing the case had concluded.Alexandria City Sheriff Dana Lawhorne told reporters late on Thursday that Manning had been released from the Alexandria Detention Centre.Trenga rejected a request from Manning to cancel fines that he had imposed for her refusal to testify and ordered her to pay fines totalling $256,000.A detention hearing for Manning scheduled for Friday was cancelled.“Needless to say we are relieved and ask that you respect her privacy while she gets on her feet,” Manning’s defence team said in an emailed statement.On Wednesday, a spokesman for Manning’s defence team said Manning had attempted to commit suicide and had been taken to hospital, where she was recovering.Spokesman Andy Stepanian said that in spite of her imprisonment and the imposition of financial sanctions, Manning remained “unwavering in her refusal to participate in a secret grand jury process that she sees as highly susceptible to abuse.”Prior to her recent incarceration for refusing to testify, Manning had served seven years in a military prison for leaking hundreds of thousands of US military messages and cables to WikiLeaks, before being released on the order of President Barack Obama.WikiLeaks, an internet-based “dead letter drop” for leakers of classified or sensitive information, was founded by Australian citizen Julian Assange in 2006.Assange is being held in a London prison as British courts consider a request from US prosecutors for his extradition to the United States. He is wanted on charges of conspiring with Manning to hack into a Pentagon computer system containing classified materials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-judge-orders-wikileaks-source-chelsea-manning-released-from-prison/story-k9rYsAx7cvUVFa76MTAb9M.html
13-03-2020||World||Mass graves dug in Iran for coronavirus victims visible from space: Report||The coronavirus has spread rapidly across the world. More than 1,28,000 people have been infected, the vast majority in just four countries: China and South Korea - where new cases are declining - and Iran and Italy, where they are not.Tracking Coronavirus Outbreak: Live UpdatesThe spread has slowed so much in China that the government sent a medical crew to Italy and offered surplus supplies to Iran.The situation is particularly grave in Iran which on Thursday reported 75 new deaths from the coronavirus, bringing the death toll to 429 in the worst-hit country in the Middle East.“We have identified 1,075 new confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the last 24 hours, meaning that there are 10,075 infected people in the country. The death toll is 429,” Health Ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur told state television. Iran on Thursday said it had asked the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for $5 billion in emergency funding to combat the coronavirus outbreak.In fact, the local outbreak was so vast in Iran that the country began digging burial trenches so large that they are visible from space. The fact was brought to light by Washington Post, which reported about the burial trenches Behesht-e Masoumeh complex in Qom, about 145 kilometres from capital Tehran.The excavation for the new burial began on February 21, the Post reported, and then rapidly expanded. The burial ground is spread over 100 yards, the report further said.The videos cited by the Post in its reportage are from BBC Persian in which the reporter is seen visiting the site of the mass graves and highlighting the new burials.The coronavirus outbreak in Iran has infected a host of senior officials, politicians, clerics and members of the elite Revolutionary Guards. Iran’s semi-official Tasnim news agency said on Thursday that Ali Akbar Velayati, a top adviser to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, had also been infected and was now under quarantine.At least seven officials and politicians have died since February 19, when Iran announced first infections and two deaths from the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mass-graves-dug-in-iran-for-coronavirus-victims-visible-from-space-report/story-EARAVQwdfcQxBJ5E2BMn7K.html

13-03-2020||World||WHO: Don’t expect travel bans, ‘Mother Nature’ to beat coronavirus||Countries may gain time in the short-term as they limit travel to fight the new coronavirus pandemic, but the World Health Organization thinks overall that “it doesn’t help to restrict movement,” a top adviser to the U.N. health agency’s chief said Thursday.Dr. Bruce Aylward, who led a WHO team in China during the raging COVID-19 outbreak there last month, said in an interview that travel bans “generally aren’t part of the armamentarium you bring to bear on something like this.”“What we found, as a general principle - not a general principle, a pretty robust principle - is that it doesn’t help to to restrict movement,” Aylward, a former WHO emergencies chief, said outside a room at agency headquarters devoted to the outbreak. “What you’re really interested in is: Where is the virus? The viruses in the cases, the viruses in their close contacts.”Aylward spoke a day after WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the worldwide spread of the virus now qualified as a pandemic and President Donald Trump announced temporary entry bans on travelers from most of Europe. Other countries also stepped up cross-border restrictions.He acknowledged that “people are confused” about the virus. He advised frequent hand-washing and other sanitary practices to avoid infection and getting tested quickly when someone suspects they’ve been exposed to the virus.Aylward also sought to dispel some myths and misconceptions about the virus. He said people shouldn’t worry about goods shipped from places with significant case numbers and remember that “sniffles” aren’t a symptom of COVID-19 but a high fever and dry cough are.He alluded to comments by some that warmer weather might snuff out the virus.“Many people ask, ‘Will this go away with the winter season?’” he said, noting that the epidemiological approach calls for locating and tracking the virus, and getting infected people out of circulation..“I would not be betting on Mother Nature here,” Aylward said. “I would be betting on case-finding. Isolation (of patients). Contact tracing. Testing. Testing. Testing.”For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.The vast majority who become infected recover. The World Health Organization says people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover.While the elderly or those with preexisting health conditions are considered most at risk, “people 30, 40, 50-years-old get sick with COVID,” Aylward said. “Most of them will recover and be fine. Some of them won’t. And some of them even will die.”“We don’t know who. And we don’t know why,” he said. “That’s very unsettling.”Aylward said he had “phenomenal confidence in the ability of the U.S. to get this under control,” noting how many epidemiologists in China — which has succeeded in minimizing new cases — had trained in the United States.“They know how to do this stuff,” he said of the U.S. experts. “And they’ve trained thousands of people across the U.S. to get organized. You mobilize that army, and you beat this most recent of enemies.”___Follow AP coverage of the virus outbreak at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak___The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

13-03-2020||World||UK bans Indian directors for aggressive call centre sales||Three Indian-origin company directors – two based in Mumbai and one in London – have been banned for 21 years after they failed to rein in a call centre that used aggressive and misleading tactics to secure sales from vulnerable people in the UK.The Insolvency Service said on Thursday that Ramakant Lal, Melvine Elias D’Silva and Soriyano D’Souza each signed 7-year disqualification undertaking; they are banned from acting as directors or directly or indirectly becoming involved, without the permission of the court, in the promotion, formation or management of a company.While D’Silva (44) is from Hounslow, west London, D’Souza (35) and Ramakant Lal (37), are from Mumbai, the service said.They were directors of a company called Vivid Lifestyle Limited, incorporated in 2013 and trading in health supplements. The company was wound-up in August 2018 following confidential enquiries after the service received complaints about its activities.Investigators discovered that throughout the life of the company, the three directors had allowed the company to trade with a lack of commercial probity and failed to provide suitable governance over their sales agents.“The company used an overseas call centre to sell the health supplements but without proper supervision, the sales agents pursued high-pressure sales tactics to dupe vulnerable people into buying the products”, the service said.Sales agents often misled customers in thinking they were medically trained, had appropriate medical qualifications or worked with the National Health Service. Call centre staff also wrongfully claimed they were existing health care providers or were calling on behalf of a government organisation.Besides, the service said the three directors failed to ensure customer credit card and bank details were used for their intended purpose. Investigators assessed that the company secured more than £1.9 million from just over 11,000 customers.Martin Gitner of the Insolvency Service said: “As directors, it was entirely down to Ramakant Lal, Melvine Elias D’Silva and Soriyano D’souza to supervise the activities of the call centre they had contracted to sell their products”. “Their conduct as directors was completely unacceptable and these substantial bans, along with the courts approval to liquidate Vivid Lifestyle, should put a stop to their misconduct, while protecting vulnerable people from further harm”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-bans-indian-directors-for-aggressive-call-centre-sales/story-yWIaiLneZ40Xsh8u5NHbuN.html

13-03-2020||World||Iran accuses US of ‘economic terrorism,’ urges sanctions end||Iran’s foreign minister demanded Thursday that the United States immediately halt what he called a “campaign of economic terrorism” and lift sanctions, saying they have made it increasingly difficult for the country to export oil and virtually impossible to import medicine and medical equipment, including to identify and treat coronavirus patients. Mohammad Javad Zarif said in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres that U.S. sanctions have also left thousands of Iranians stranded abroad and severely disrupted air links with Europe. And he said they have led to what he called “Google’s immoral censoring” of a new government app designed to help Iranians identify potential symptoms of the COVID-19 virus. He said “it is imperative” that the government of the United States immediately halt its campaign of economic terrorism against the Iranian people and lift all sanctions it has illegally imposed on my country,” in violation of the Security Council resolution that endorsed the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six major powers which the U.S. pulled out of in 2018. “To this end,” Zarif said, “It is imperative that the United Nations and its member states join the Iranian people in demanding that the government of the United States abandon its malign and fruitless approach against Iran.” The new coronavirus, COVID-19, has swept across Iran, with the Health Ministry announcing Thursday that in the past 24 hours 75 people had died and more than 1,000 new cases had been confirmed, bringing the death toll to 429 and confirmed cases to 10,075. U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is “deeply concerned” about the coronavirus outbreak in Iran and the U.N. system is providing support. But the U.N. chief is also very aware “of the shortage of medicine and medical equipment that makes it much more difficult to contain the outbreak in Iran, and he appeals to all member states to facilitate and support Iran’s efforts in this critical moment,” Dujarric said. Zarif said it is “unconscionable” that the U.S. government has not only increased its “maximum pressure” campaign “just as the virus has spread and is killing our most vulnerable citizens, but that it additionally has the audacity to lecture us on containing the coronavirus as it itself is evidently incapable of containing its onslaught.” He sharply criticised the U.S. “bullying others to refrain from engaging in legitimate trade with Iran” and said “even if foreign suppliers are found and required items can be purchased with our assets abroad, myriad U.S. shipping, insurance, financial and banking sanctions make such trade nonviable” which is a violation of the 2015 Security Council resolution and international humanitarian law, “amounting to a crime against humanity.” Even before the COVID-19 outbreak, Zarif said “inaction” by some countries led to a reduction in the value and quantity of imports from Europe of all pharmaceutical goods, from medical disinfectants to breathing appliances. And he said imports are now at a lower level than before the 2016 implementation of the Iran nuclear deal. “While other nations debate how to control the spread of the virus — and while their economies suffer and fear takes hold among their populations — our people not only suffer from its effects without the full benefits of adequate medical equipment and supplies, but also the many other ways in which U.S. economic terrorism had devastated many households prior to the inception of COVID-19, and only made worse since its arrival in Iran,” Zarif said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-accuses-us-of-economic-terrorism-urges-sanctions-end/story-e0ib5BO2ogQHYdPH65b9JP.html
13-03-2020||World||Amid virus fears, Trump moves away from rallies for now||President Donald Trump said Thursday he is temporarily halting his trademark rallies — as his campaign bows to the coronavirus outbreak that is rapidly reshaping the nation’s political landscape.The rallies have long been Trump’s most potent political weapon: They energize the candidate, give him a powerful platform from which to attack his adversaries and allow his team to collect a treasure trove of voter data.But the spread of the virus, which has closed schools and shuttered professional sports leagues, has also touched the 2020 presidential campaign. The two leading Democratic contenders, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, cancelled their scheduled rallies earlier this week.The president’s reelection team reluctantly followed suit, with Trump saying Thursday that multiple events that were in the works are being postponed.“We had about three of them in Nevada, actually. And we had four or five of them of them that we were thinking about,” Trump said at the White House.The president’s campaign has suspended all rallies, events and fundraisers for at least the next week, according to officials. Trump was slated to fly west Thursday night for events in Nevada and Colorado, a trip that was cancelled after his Oval Office address to the nation on Wednesday night about the severity of the coronavirus outbreak.Campaign officials met Thursday to work out a plan for how to proceed while the virus makes traditional campaigning ill-advised, especially considering the higher risk it presents to older voters, many of whom support the president. Options under consideration include virtual town halls and conference calls for supporters.The tentative western itinerary included a rally and fundraisers in each state — including one in Colorado benefiting Republican Sen. Cory Gardner — as well as a previously announced stop at the Republican Jewish Coalition’s annual conference in Las Vegas, hosted by GOP megadonor Sheldon Adelson.Trump said in the Oval Office on Thursday that he would hold the Gardner event “here,” which would have been a violation of the Hatch Act preventing political activity at the White House. A White House spokesman said later the president was not referring to a fundraiser but rather a roundtable on the Land and Water Conservation Fund, an official government event that had not previously been announced.Trump refused to rule out a rapid return to rallies, even though the government’s own health experts have advised against large gatherings of people. Events with comparable-sized crowds, like NBA and NHL games, have been postponed indefinitely.The campaign had previously been eyeing, but had not yet announced, a rally in Tampa, Florida, on March 25. Trump said he would be “making a decision at the appropriate time” on whether to hold that one, adding that he would “probably not do it because people would say that it’s better not to do. You know, we need a little separation until such time as this goes away. It’s going to go away.” “I’m not going to do it if I think it’s going to be negative at all,” the president said. “I don’t want people dying.” For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover.Trump claimed that more than 100,000 people had requested tickets for the Tampa rally, an impossibility since the campaign had not yet announced the event or made tickets available. A campaign spokesman declined to comment.The campaign also canceled a “Catholics for Trump” coalition event that had been scheduled for Milwaukee next week. Vice President Mike Pence also planned to stop all campaign activity for two weeks, a White House official said. But the campaign’s social media and text accounts sent out notes to supporters praising the president’s “aggressive and comprehensive” effort to stop the virus spread.Increasingly focused on his campaign, Trump had pushed aides up until this week to continue scheduling huge rallies. He had hoped to use them to blunt the momentum of his likely general election foe, Biden, who offers himself as someone better positioned to respond to the coronavirus.Standing in front of a backdrop meant to look presidential, Biden delivered a speech about the virus on Thursday and announced a virtual town hall with Illinois voters the following day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-virus-fears-trump-moves-away-from-rallies-for-now/story-w12fVDYBPXzT95ScJmKu2J.html
13-03-2020||World||Students impacted by campus closures due to coronavirus in US to get help||Indian and other foreign students impacted by the temporary closure of campuses and in-person teaching by US universities due to the spread of coronavirus are likely to be helped by their respective institutions in most instances to find alternate accommodation and continue their studies online.The Indian embassy here has also started a 24/7 helpline for these students and others planning to travel to India in view of the new travel restrictions and is roping in the Indian American community here in the national capital and elsewhere through its consulates to help. The helpline numbers are +1 202 213 1364 and +1 202 262 0375; and the email address is cons4.washington@mea.gov.in.More than 202,000 Indian students are enrolled in US universities and many of them stay on campus and many stay outside. Those staying on campus stand to be impacted the most as their universities close their campuses, end in-person teaching and switch to virtual classroom in view of the spread of coronavirus and shift to online classes.They have either closed already or will, starting from Monday for the spring break and have asked students to go back to their permanent addresses and not return till sometime in April, which will be determined by the situation. Classes will be conducted online after the end of the spring break.“The decision to move to virtual instruction was not made lightly,” Harvard President Larry Bacow said in a letter to students on Tuesday. “The goal of these changes is to minimize the need to gather in large groups and spend prolonged time in close proximity with each other in spaces such as classrooms, dining halls, and residential buildings.”And an online FAQ posted by the university on the changes said, “We know there will be difficult and extenuating circumstances for students who cannot leave campus by March 23 or do not have another place to go. Harvard will provide you the help you need to stay safe, secure, and continue with your academic work.”Georgetown University in Washington DC has made a similar arrangement. “We understand that for some number of students there will be a compelling reason to remain on campus,” John J. DeGioia, president of Georgetown university in Washington DC wrote in a letter to the university community on Wednesday. “Campus will remain open and key services will be available.”Life and plans will be disrupted because of the closure and the extended spring recess that has been ordered by the universities but for some a big worry was how will their families come for India for their convocation, due in a few weeks, because of travel restrictions going up around the world.But that’s for later. “I feel reassured by steps taken by the university,” said Sayantan Sahu, a graduate student at the University of Maryland.The Spring Break that usually lasts a week and most Indian students don’t go back to India. They make plans instead to stay with friends and relatives or to just travel around and be back when classes resume. This time, they have more time on their hands because of extended breaks.Harvard resumes classes, online classes, on March 23, and will continue online classes “to the greatest extent possible for the weeks ahead”. Georgetown will start its virtual classrooms on March 16 and Beginning Monday, The University of Maryland will move to online classes on March 30 and go on till at least April 10, it has said in an online guidance on its coronavirus-related closure and changes. Other universities have their own schedules, that are available online.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/students-impacted-by-campus-closures-due-to-coronavirus-in-us-to-get-help/story-GRnDtzOpzbKxpppGSw8geO.html

However, he is not exhibiting any symptoms of the disease,” Eduardo Bolsonaro, a lawmaker, wrote on Twitter.The far-right leader’s test results are expected Friday, Brazilian media reports said.He cancelled a scheduled trip Thursday to the city of Mossoro, in northeastern Brazil, and his office said he had no other official events on his daily agenda.Bolsonaro had previously sought to downplay the coronavirus outbreak, saying its severity had been “overstated.” The news came after Bolsonaro’s communications chief, Fabio Wajngarten, tested positive for COVID-19 after a trip to the United States last weekend during which both men met with the US president at his Florida resort.Wajngarten was photographed standing side-by-side with Trump.But Trump said he was “not concerned,” and the White House said he did not need testing.Trump and Vice President Mike Pence “had almost no interactions with the individual,” Trump spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said in a statement.They “do not require being tested at this time,” she said, explaining that US government guidelines do not recommend testing for people without symptoms.Eduardo Bolsonaro, who also accompanied his father to the United States, said he was undergoing testing as well.The Brazilian delegation also included Foreign Minister Ernesto Araujo, who cut short a subsequent trip to Washington Thursday to return to Brazil. He would follow all current protocols on the virus, his office said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazilian-president-jair-bolsonaro-undergoes-test-for-coronavirus/story-ARSKabUCJY17HFMFH9KwjN.html
13-03-2020||World||Fewer coronavirus cases being reported, so peak has passed: China||The peak of the novel coronavirus outbreak has passed, China’s national health authorities said on Thursday, hours after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the contagion a pandemic.The situation in China, where the virus originated, has improved remarkably with a steady decline in new cases. The number of new cases has dropped to a single digit in ground zero - the city of Wuhan.“China has passed the climax of the novel coronavirus outbreak with the number of new infections continuing to decline,” Mi Feng, spokesperson of the national health commission (NHC), said at a press conference in Beijing.The announcement came two days after President Xi Jinping visited Wuhan for the first time since the outbreak began, signalling that the situation has turned a corner in China.Until weeks ago, China was reporting hundreds of new cases of the infection daily. The central Chinese province of Hubei, worst-hit by the outbreak that began in late December, had just eight new cases in the last 24 hours - all of them in Wuhan.Only seven new cases were reported on the Chinese mainland outside Hubei; six of them were ‘imported’ from abroad. Overall, 15 new Covid-19 infections and 11 new deaths were reported on Wednesday on the Chinese mainland. The total number of infections stood at 80,793, with 3,169 deaths.With six new cases reported on Wednesday, the total number of ‘imported’ cases in China reached 85, with 46 coming from Iran and 27 from Italy.Wuhan could clear all infected cases to zero by the end of March if all efforts being implemented continue uninterrupted, and there are no emergencies over infections coming in from overseas, leading epidemiologist Li Lanjuan has said.NHC spokesperson Mi said China had taken the most comprehensive prevention and control measures to contain the outbreak. Wuhan was put under a lockdown on January 23, and across Hubei, millions faced restrictions. As the restrictions are likely to be lifted in a staggered manner, the Chinese government’s focus will now be on reviving the economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fewer-cases-being-reported-so-peak-has-passed-china/story-ANEUwGE5EFUiyvPvTIzS3M.html
