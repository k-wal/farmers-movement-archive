14-03-2020||World||White House now conducting temperature checks on all close to Trump, Pence amid coronavirus outbreak||The White House announced Saturday that it is now conducting temperature checks on anyone who is in close contact with President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.The move is being taken out of an abundance of caution in response to the coronavirus outbreak, said Judd Deere, a White House spokesman.Trump and Pence attended an afternoon news conference at the White House, and Trump said he had his own temperature taken before speaking to reporters.“It was totally normal,” Trump said. “If it wasn’t, I wouldn’t have been here. ”Trump has had multiple direct and indirect contacts with people who have tested positive for the pandemic virus. On Friday, he declared a state of emergency as schools and workplaces across the country shuttered, flights were canceled and Americans braced for war against the health threat.Trump spent time last weekend at his private club in Florida with at least three people who have now tested positive.The Brazilian Embassy in Washington announced late Friday that the country’s chargé d’affaires, Nestor Forster, tested positive after sitting at Trump’s dinner table. So, too, have a top aide to Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and an individual who attended a fundraiser Sunday with Trump, according to two Republican officials who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss private health matters.Trump has been known to flout public health advice — and was eagerly shaking hands during an event Friday — but acknowledged he “most likely” will be tested soon. The White House physician has indicated that Trump’s interactions were low risk and testing was not necessary.A representative from the White House physician’s office took the temperate of members of the media who were at the White House on Saturday, going around to each person and putting the device to their heads. A reporter with a suspected elevated temperature was not allowed into the briefing room for a news conference with Trump and Pence about the outbreak.Public health officials say that individuals with a cough and elevated temperatures of 100.4 degrees or higher are deemed concerning.Pence’s spokeswoman, Katie Miller, tweeted that according to the White House Medical Unit, the temperature was taken three times over a 15 minute period and all three registered above the 1004. guidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-now-conducting-temperature-checks-on-all-close-to-donald-trump-mike-pence-amid-coronavirus-outbreak/story-5HLOBrtiMV1QA3rXVAveMM.html
14-03-2020||World||Spain locks down as coronavirus infections spike: Report||Spain’s government is set to announce Saturday that it is placing tight restrictions on movement and closing restaurants and other establishments in the nation of 46 million people as part of a two-week state of emergency to fight the sharp rise in coronavirus infections.The Associated Press has access to the draft of the battery of measures that Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez will announce in a nationally televised address.According to the draft of the government order, people will only be allowed to leave their homes to buy food and medicine, commute to work, go to medical centers and banks, or take trips related to the care for the young and the elderly. Those limitations will take hold at Monday at 7:00 GMT.Effectively immediately, Spain is also closing all restaurants, bars, hotels, education centers nationwide, and other non-essential retail outlets, a move some of the hardest-hit communities have already carried out.Health authorities in Spain said Saturday that coronavirus infections have reached 5,753 people, half of them in the capital, Madrid. That represents a national increase of over 1,500 in 24 hours.Sánchez acknowledged on Friday that the number of infections could reach 10,000 in the coming days.Spain has followed Italy’s path in implementing a similar lockdown after both European countries failed to contain the virus in regional hotspots.Italy extended the strict restriction on movement from the north to the entire country on March 9 when it registered over 9,000 infections. It then went further on March 11 and closed all retail outlets except some supermarkets and pharmacies.Already in Spain, residents in Madrid and northeast Catalonia awoke Saturday to shuttered bars and restaurants and other non-essential commercial outlets as ordered by regional authorities the day before.The decision by prime minister Sánchez comes after some regions of Spain with viral clusters, led by Madrid, had taken steps to close restaurants and other non-essential establishments. The regional chiefs of Madrid and Catalonia had also asked for the central government to help tighten the screws on transport and restrict the circulation of people.The normally bustling streets of Spain’s two biggest cities were noticeably quieter as the message sinks in that social distancing is the only way to stop the global pandemic after its eruption in China.Spooked shoppers packed some supermarkets early in the morning despite calls for calm from authorities and supermarket owners.In the capital, however, the town hall was forced to close parks after many people continued their Saturday morning jogs and other outdoor pastimes.Authorities and public health care workers, as well as television and radio news anchors, are making pleas for people to stay at home in order to reduce the spiking contagion curve.Authorities in parts of southern Spain have also blocked access to coastal areas in an attempt to stop people who had taken advantage of the closing of schools this week and “work from home” options to take impromptu beach trips.A state of emergency allows the central government to limit free movement, legally confiscate goods and take over control of industries and private facilities, including private hospitals. It’s only the second time that the government has evoked it since the return of democracy in the late 1970s. The other was declared during a 2010 air traffic controllers’ strike.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spain-locks-down-as-coronavirus-infections-spike-report/story-v8e9bnIj2J9i4uIdf0H5dN.html
14-03-2020||World||Urine cure? UK targets myths, fake news about coronavirus||The Boris Johnson government is funding a new initiative to challenge myths, misinformation, conspiracies and mistruths such as drinking bleach or urine to cure coronavirus, as the UK grapples with new cases and deaths.Officials cited the example of the sister of a Bollywood actor reportedly sharing a controversial video from China as one of the examples of “more damaging mistruths” being targeted in the initiative funded by the Department for International Development.The example of ‘promoting violence’ mentioned in an official release says: “Rumours that the virus was created or spread deliberately have already led to reported attacks on Chinese nationals across South East Asia as well as in the UK”.“A video claiming to show Chinese officials shooting coronavirus victims and alleging tens of thousands were executed went viral on social media sites worldwide, after the celebrity sister of a prominent Bollywood actor in India shared them. The video was in fact edited from four completely unrelated clips, including one of Chinese police shooting a rabid dog”.The release adds that “more damaging mistruths’ include miracle cures for the virus, “such as drinking chlorine dioxide, an industrial bleach, or urine, eating garlic, gargling saltwater or spreading cow dung and mustard paste”.It cited the example of Myanmar, where news websites have reported false claims supposedly from health officials, advising people to sleep next to chopped onions claiming this will “absorb the virus” or to drink ginger juice.“It is also falsely claimed you cannot catch coronavirus if you have a mosquito bite. Scammers pretending to be health officials in Myanmar have been selling black pepper seeds as a cure”, the release adds.The initiative includes engaging social media influencers such as Bianca Gonzalez from the Philippines, Jahangir Kabir from Bangladeshi, and KlikDokter, an Indonesian health blog.International Development Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said: “Misinformation harms us all. By tackling it at source we will help stop the spread of fake news – and coronavirus – worldwide, including within the UK”.The initiative will analyse social media and online content to identify where the misinformation is coming from and how it is spreading – so victims of fake news can be sent the correct information and directed to official health advice, the release adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/urine-cure-uk-targets-myths-fake-news-about-coronavirus/story-7IBTIKVlu3FrilsKkpnaTL.html

The virus has also infected a number of senior officials there.Saudi Arabia earlier said it would halt all international flights to the kingdom for two weeks in the latest effort to contain the spread of the new virus.Gulf nations have been scrambling to contain the pandemic, which has spread to more than 100 countries and infected more than 130,000 people. Of special concern is nearby Iran.For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.The vast majority of people recover from the new virus in a matter of weeks, but the outbreak has caused more than 5,000 deaths worldwide.The state-run Saudi Press Agency, quoting an unnamed Interior Ministry official, said flights would be cancelled starting Sunday.In the United Arab Emirates, health officials ordered the elderly to stay home because of the coronavirus outbreak and authorities said some federal employees could begin working from home for two weeks starting Sunday.Abu Dhabi’s The National newspaper reported that nightclubs and tourist restaurants in the emirate will be shut down until the end of March. The Department of Culture and Tourism also suspended all planned events, including concerts, in Abu Dhabi. The decision does not extend to Dubai.A number of major sporting events, conferences and other gatherings have been cancelled across the globe. The virus is highly contagious, and even those showing no symptoms can spread it, making large public gatherings particularly risky.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-says-coronavirus-kills-another-97-pushing-death-toll-to-611/story-2wilyCxAAKKipHDCeLlODK.html
14-03-2020||World||Donald Trump declares national emergency to fight coronavirus; plans to be tested||US President Donald Trump on Friday declared a national emergency to combat the outbreak of coronavirus that has infected more than 1,600 Americans and killed 41, and said he will “most likely” get himself tested, but not because of his meeting with a foreign official later found infected.The emergency declaration will allow the administration access to $50 billion of disaster-relief funds to address the outbreak.“To unleash the full power of the federal government in this effort, today I am officially declaring a national emergency, two very big words,” Trump said at an outdoor news conference at the White House, flanked by all the senior member of his coronavirus task-force and business leaders.The president also announced expanded testing for infection at drive-through facilities coming up on the premises of grocery chain Walmart and Target. Lack of adequate testing has emerged as a key weakness in the administration’s response to the outbreak, which, critics fear, may be far worse than known.Coronavirus cases had been reported from 49 of the country’s 50 states and by the end of Friday 14 of them had closed their schools. All big large gatherings such as election rallies, entertainment parks and sporting events and annual concerts, festivals and conferences have been cancelled or postponed.An increasing number of people are now working from home, government and private. College students have been forced to return to their permanent addresses — to parents — as universities have shut down campuses and in-person teaching. And families are stocking up on supplies wracked by uncertainties.President Trump has faced growing criticism of his handling o the crisis and for underplaying the crisis, in concert with conservative TV anchors; and for blaming his missteps and shortcomings on President Barack Obama.Asked if he took responsibility for the inadequate testing, something that has been acknowledged as “a failing” by one of the key members of the coronavirus task-force, the president said, not conscious perhaps of the full import of his words, “I don’t take responsibility at all.”The president has also seemed unwilling to lead the offensive against the virus by example. He shook hands with members of his team at the new conference, as was widely noted and commented upon on social media; patted some on of them on the back and repeatedly touched the microphone used by multiple other speaker. With the exception of an elbow bump.The American president did relent a little on the question of his own susceptibility to the virus because of an extended interaction with a visiting Brazilian official at Trump’s Florida home and report, Mar-a-Lago. The foreign dignitary has since tested positive for coronavirus.He had, until Friday, insisted he did not need to be tested. But he relented under persistent questioning by reporters. “Most likely, yeah. Most likely,” he said but sought to distance it from the dinner meeting at which the Brazilian official was present, seated close enough to pass on the virus to president.Trump was exposed to a second visitor at the Mar-a-Lago resort who later tested positive for coronavirus.The president’s eldest daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump has also faced questions about exposure to the virus after a meeting with a visiting Australian official who later tested positive. The foreign dignitary had also met Attorney General William Barr. There was no word if either of them had been tested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-declares-national-emergency-to-fight-coronavirus-plans-to-be-tested/story-yEtTRgYo5ZUfOFSVVVwPQK.html
14-03-2020||World||Netanyahu requested PM Modi to allow export of raw medical supplies to Israel: Report||Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu requested Narendra Modi to approve and allow the export of masks and pharmaceutical raw materials to Israel during his telephonic conversation with his Indian counterpart this week, according to a media report. Israel’s Channel 13 on Friday reported that Netanyahu made the request after India decided to stop the export of these items to meet its own domestic requirements in view of the rapid spread of coronavirus.The leading news channel also put out a promotional tweet ahead of its broadcast during its main evening bullettin. At a press conference on Wednesday, the Israeli Prime Minister had mentioned about reaching out to Modi, among other leaders, hinting at Israeli efforts to maintain and stabilise “supply lines” of essential materials in view of the massive disruption caused by COVID-19. “I also spoke to the Prime Minister of India, my friend Narendra Modi. We are dependent on supply lines from various countries. We are looking into it all the time,” Netanyahu told reporters on Wednesday evening. His remarks came during joint statements with the finance minister, the economy and industry minister, the Bank of Israel’s governor and the finance ministry director general on dealing with the economic implications of the coronavirus. Netanyahu, however, did not share any specific details of his discussions with his Indian counterpart during the press conference. Itamar Grotto, deputy director-general of the Israeli Health Ministry, said Modi agreed to allow the export of materials for medicines to Israel, but there was no decision yet on the masks. “Special permission was given and the drug procurement is being carried out now. The Indians agreed to exempt Israel,” Grotto told Channel 13. The report cited three unnamed Israeli officials as saying that Netanyahu asked Modi to lift the export ban on these items, which were imposed several weeks ago, as Israel imports most of the raw materials it needs for medicines from India. The Israeli Health Ministry has requested its embassy in New Delhi to ask Indian officials to allow hundreds of thousands of protective masks to be sent to Israel due to a shortage in the country, the report said. Netanyahu on Friday sought to reassure his countrymen that a series of restrictions imposed by the administration to try and stem the spread of coronavirus would not affect the food supply, saying there was “no reason to storm supermarkets”. “We are investing considerable means right now to increase the pace of testing, to reduce the infection rate and – of course – to reinforce, strengthen and safeguard the medical teams, as well as many other things,” Netanyahu said. “You have no reason to storm supermarkets. There will be enough food in general and for the (upcoming Passover) holiday,” he stressed. Some Israelis have been stocking up on supplies, fearing extended periods of quarantine, lockdown orders, or shortages. Some 35,000 Israelis are said to be in quarantine, almost 1,000 of them doctors and over 600 nurses. Three Israelis are said to be seriously ill with the virus, and almost 150 have tested positive. Nobody has died from coronavirus in Israel. The deadly novel coronavirus that first originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December last year has claimed over 5,000 lives and infected more than 134,000 people across 110 countries and territories, with the World Health Organisation (WHO) describing the outbreak a pandemic on Wednesday. Israel has taken tough measures in its preparations to fight with the coronavirus closing down schools, sports activities, and imposing restrictions on gatherings and workplaces. The deadly virus first originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December last year.

14-03-2020||World||US House of Representatives passes Trump-backed coronavirus relief package||The House passed an economic relief plan backed by President Donald Trump to deal with the spreading coronavirus as part of what lead negotiator Speaker Nancy Pelosi said will be a continuing effort to help the American people.The 363-40 vote early Saturday sends the measure to the Senate, which plans to skip next week’s planned recess to take up the bill. The House is not planning to be in session next week.“I encourage all Republicans and Democrats to come together and VOTE YES!” Trump wrote on Twitter Friday after two days of intense negotiations between Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The president added, “Look forward to signing the final Bill, ASAP!“The House package includes free testing for everyone who needs it, and two weeks of paid sick leave to allow people with the virus to stay home from work and avoid infecting co-workers. It also includes enhanced jobless benefits, increased food aid for children, senior citizens and food banks, and higher funding for Medicaid benefits.The growing outbreak is beginning to squeeze the U.S. economy as schools and sports leagues shut down and businesses scale back or require employees to work from home.Earlier Friday, Trump declared a national emergency that would free up as much as $50 billion to help states and cities respond to the health crisis, waive student-loan interest, purchase large quantities of oil and confer new authority on his health secretary to bypass hospital regulations.HOPE FOR INVESTORSEven though Pelosi said the bill is aimed at helping families, rather than providing broader fiscal stimulus, the bipartisan deal provides a bit of hope for investors who were looking for any indication that policymakers could work together to address the multifaceted crisis.Markets rallied during Trump’s news conference, unwinding almost 90% of the previous day’s historic rout.Pelosi said that while the Senate works on the House bill next week, her chamber’s leaders will begin working on an additional emergency response measure.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement shortly after Saturday’s vote that the Senate “will need to carefully review” the House measure. “But I believe the vast majority of senators in both parties will agree we should act swiftly to secure relief for American workers, families, and small businesses,” he said.As the crisis ballooned, the Federal Reserve was the first to act with last week’s rate cut and this week’s massive repo operations and expanded securities purchases to ease “temporary disruptions” in the market. There is pressure on the Fed’s Open Market Committee to slash interest rates to zero when it meets in Washington March 17-18.Last week Congress passed and Trump signed into law an emergency spending bill that made available about $8 billion to reimburse state and local governments for the cost of preparing for and fighting the virus, stockpile medical supplies and purchase tests, vaccines and therapies to ensure that the poor have access. It also permits Medicare to spend $500 million on telehealth programs for the virus.ROILING MARKETSWith infections multiplying and no vaccine immediately available, Pelosi pushed ahead with a Democrats-only plan earlier this week when the Trump administration didn’t deliver a promised proposal to respond to the economic consequences of the outbreak. In addition, Trump’s error-filled Oval Office address Wednesday failed to calm roiling equity markets.“We could have passed our bill yesterday,” Pelosi told reporters Friday night. “But we thought it would be important to show the American people, to assure the American people, that we are willing and able to work together to get a job done for them.”“It was really important for us to have a bill right now because the challenge was there,” Pelosi said.House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who waited to comment on the plan until after Trump announced his endorsement, called the agreement “a really good sign that shows bipartisanship.” It shows we can “beat this virus,” he said.The bill takes a number of steps to ensure expansive availability of free testing for the virus in the U.S., including providing $1 billion for testing and diagnostics services for people who don’t have health coverage.A number of provisions are geared toward low-income families and individuals by providing additional funding for food banks and recipients of food stamps and other nutrition assistance programs. It allow states to give lower-income parents direct payments to pay for food their children won’t be getting through free or reduced-price meals at their schools.The bill would provide $1 billion in emergency grants to states to help them administer unemployment benefits, with half of the funds targeted to states with the worst spikes in joblessness.SICK LEAVEOne of the biggest sticking points in the negotiations was over provisions requiring employers to provide paid sick leave.Workers will get up to two weeks of paid sick leave to deal with coronavirus issues and another 10 weeks of coronavirus-related paid family leave at two-thirds pay in the bill, with the government reimbursing businesses for the cost via new, temporary tax credits.Smaller companies could get exemptions from the paid family leave after the first two weeks of sick leave provided doing so would risk closing their businesses - a provision sought by McCarthy.More than a quarter of private U.S. workers don’t have paid medical leave, including more than half of part-time workers and about 40% of service employees.U.S. lawmakers don’t know how much the House bill, H.R. 6201, will cost, and Democrats said they didn’t plan to wait for an estimate from the Congressional Budget Office before voting.The revised bill also boosts the federal match for Medicaid by 6.2 percentage points, less than the 8 percent in Pelosi’s original bill but still something that will give states potentially tens of billions in additional funding if the coronavirus crisis extends for months.The bill also sunsets at the end of the year - another win for Republicans who did not want to create a new, permanent sick leave requirement for employers.The deal at times appeared teetering on the brink. As he announced a national emergency, Trump cast doubt on on the plan, telling reporters at the White House that Democrats weren’t giving enough in the negotiations.The House proposal set aside Trump’s call for a long holiday from the payroll tax that funds Social Security, which faces bipartisan skepticism. Some Republicans said they could address that issue later.The Capitol was closed to the public Friday in an effort to curb the spread of the virus. Several members of Congress closed their Washington offices because of a staff member’s infection or exposure to the virus, and staff are working from their homes.(Updates with McConnell comment in 10th paragraph)--With assistance from Jack Fitzpatrick.To contact the reporters on this story: Billy House in Washington at bhouse5@bloomberg.net;Laura Litvan in Washington at llitvan@bloomberg.net;Steven T.

14-03-2020||World||Democrats ready stimulus as Mnuchin says virus hit on US economy ‘short-term’||President Donald Trump is “very close” to reaching a stimulus agreement with US lawmakers to fight the coronavirus outbreak’s economic damage, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Friday, as Democrats prepared to pass their own proposal.Democratic House leader Nancy Pelosi said her party would pass a bill “focused directly on providing support for America’s families” that includes expansions of paid sick leave and unemployment insurance, among other measures.However, it was unclear if Trump or the Republican leadership in the Senate were behind the proposal, though a Pelosi aide said the House speaker had spoken to Mnuchin repeatedly over the past days.The fear surrounding the pandemic has pushed Wall Street indices into a bear market, which efforts to contain its spread shut down Disneyland and Broadway, and led major sports leagues to cancel or postpone their seasons, but Mnuchin called the slowdown a “short-term issue.”The president is committed to getting a “major stimulus package” through Congress, Mnuchin told CNBC early Friday, but he did not provide specifics. Options include a payroll tax cut and other ways to provide funds for people who cannot work because of the virus.“There’s no question there’s a short-term economic issue, but we will get through this.”Pelosi said the Democratic bill will focus on “testing, testing, testing” in addition to paid sick leave and expanding unemployment benefits.The announcements came one day after the Dow had its worst session since 1987, diving 10 percent in Thursday trading even as the US Federal Reserve moved to inject $1.5 trillion of cash into markets this week and broadened its purchases of US Treasury debt -- both moves reminiscent of the global financial crisis in 2008.Uncertainty over the stimulus package and sharp partisan rhetoric were exacerbating factors in Thursday’s declines, where selling was also spurred by Trump’s shock travel ban on Europe and the near-constant stream of event cancelations.DIMMING CONFIDENCEMnuchin vowed said once the virus is overcome “the economy will be stronger than ever.” He also encouraged people to buy stocks, rejected the need to close markets and said he would be willing to fly commercial airlines. “Not everybody who has sniffles will have the coronavirus,” Mnuchin said.The Dow had regained about 2.5 percent in afternoon trading Friday, retreating from the surge seen at the open.The Fed made an emergency interest rate cut last week, and on Wednesday is expected to lower the benchmark borrowing rate again, possible cutting all the way to zero.The University of Michigan’s monthly consumer sentiment survey showed Americans are worried by the impact of COVID-19 on the economy.The report’s chief economist Richard Curtin said while “the pandemic is widely regarded as a temporary event,” the economy needs immediate relief in the form of “multiple sources of cash transfers and debt forbearance.” “To avoid a recession, speed is more essential than targeting.”Since breaking out in China, the COVID-19 virus has killed more than 5,000 people as of Friday and spread globally with cases topping 134,000, according to an AFP tally.Health authorities have warned that the outbreak is already well-entrenched in the US: the state of Ohio likely has more than 100,000 people carrying the virus, its health department said Friday.Meanwhile at least six US states have ordered schools to close as confirmed infections in the country climbed to more than 1,660 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democrats-ready-stimulus-as-mnuchin-says-virus-hit-on-us-economy-short-term/story-wZMjed3gHvqc5Gc0rAoCqN.html
14-03-2020||World||US summons Chinese envoy over Beijing’s coronavirus comments||The US State Department summoned the Chinese ambassador to the United States on Friday to protest against comments by Beijing suggesting the US military might have brought the coronavirus to Wuhan, as tensions between the two global powers over the outbreak intensified.David Stillwell, the top US diplomat for East Asia, delivered a very “stern representation” to China’s ambassador Cui Tiankai, a State Department official said, adding that Beijing’s envoy was “very defensive.”The State Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said China was seeking to deflect criticism of its role in “starting a global pandemic and not telling the world.”“Spreading conspiracy theories is dangerous and ridiculous. We wanted to put the government on notice we won’t tolerate it for the good of the Chinese people and the world.”Defence Department Spokeswoman Alyssa Farah wrote on Twitter on Friday that “the Communist Party of China has chosen to promulgate false & absurd conspiracy theories about the origin of COVID-19 blaming US service members. #ChinaPropaganda”The virus, also called COVID-19, has infected 138,000 people worldwide and killed more than 5,000.China’s embassy did not respond to requests for comment.Despite the signs of tension, US President Donald Trump praised Beijing on Friday for its “data sharing”. Asked by a reporter during a White House news conference about “odd narratives” being offered by some Chinese officials, Trump appeared to brush off any concern, saying he had read one article on the subject, but that he did not think it was representative of his discussions with Chinese President Xi Jinping.Trump, who in a national address this week called the outbreak a “foreign virus” that started in China, added: “They know where it came from, we all know where it came from.” Tensions escalated after Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian took to Twitter on Thursday.“When did patient zero begin in US? How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals? It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation!” Zhao tweeted in English.The episode is the latest in an increasing war of words between Washington and Beijing, whose already strained ties over issues including trade, intellectual property rights and press freedom have further been tested by the virus outbreak.The coronavirus, which emerged in China in December, has spread around the world, pummelling financial markets, halting industry, bringing some flights to a standstill, closing schools and forcing the postponement of sports events and concerts.Zhao’s comments came days after Robert O’Brien, the US national security adviser, said China had reacted slowly to the coronavirus, probably costing the world two months when it could have been preparing.Wuhan was ground zero for the outbreak, which the World Health Organization this week labelled a pandemic. It has infected more than 127,000 people worldwide, including nearly 81,000 in mainland China, and killed more than 5,000 people.Beijing was criticized for initially attempting to censor some Chinese doctors who sounded an alarm over the virus. Since January, it has imposed draconian containment measures, effectively locking down Wuhan and the surrounding Hubei province, home to 60 million people. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has complained that the US response had been hindered by what he called imperfect data from Beijing.He and several other US politicians have angered Beijing by referring to the “Wuhan virus.” In a national address on Wednesday, Trump called the outbreak a “foreign virus” that started in China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-summons-chinese-envoy-over-beijing-s-coronavirus-comments/story-2E2OuF2Kp1woBHUu1uQx6H.html
14-03-2020||World||Trump emergency releases $50 bn in funds to fight coronavirus in US||President Donald Trump’s declaration on Friday that the coronavirus outbreak is a “national emergency” allows billions of federal dollars and resources to be funneled to hard-hit US states.NATIONAL EMERGENCYIn declaring that the coronavirus outbreak in the United States constitutes a national emergency, Trump invoked the Stafford Act.The Stafford Act was passed by Congress in 1988 to provide federal assistance to state and local governments in order to “save lives and to protect property and public health and safety.”The Stafford Act can also be called upon to provide federal aid to states and local governments to help them respond to “major disasters” such as hurricanes, earthquakes, landslides, flooding, tsunamis or fires.“Only the Federal Government can provide the necessary coordination to address a pandemic of this national size and scope caused by a pathogen introduced into our country,” Trump said in a letter to department chiefs informing them that he was invoking the Stafford Act.In a proclamation, Trump also cited sections of the National Emergencies Act (NEA) to expand the authority of the Secretary of Health and Human Services to deal with the crisis. The NEA gives the White House sweeping powers to declare martial law, suspend civil liberties, expand the military, seize property and restrict trade, communications and financial transactions.FEMAThe Stafford Act gives the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), part of the Department of Homeland Security, the authority to tap into a disaster relief fund.The FEMA fund had $42.6 billion at the end of February but Trump said at a press conference that “up to $50 billion” would be made available. In a letter to the president on Wednesday, 36 Democratic senators urged him to draw on the fund to deal with the coronavirus outbreak which has caused over 2,000 infections and 47 deaths in the United States.“State and local officials are working hard to mitigate the outbreak and protect Americans and ongoing federal resources are badly needed to support those efforts,” they said.The funds can be used for a variety of purposes including testing, diagnosis, treatment and monitoring, medical equipment and temporary shelter such as tents or portable buildings.The federal authorities would assume 75 percent of the cost while the states contribute the remaining 25 percent.PRECEDENTSPresident Bill Clinton issued a declaration of emergency under the Stafford Act in 2000 to assist the states of New York and New Jersey in fighting an outbreak of West Nile virus.President Barack Obama invoked the National Emergencies Act to respond to an outbreak of H1N1 swine flu in 2009 and president George W. Bush invoked it after 9/11.Trump invoked the NEA in February of last year to obtain funding refused by Congress for his US-Mexico border wall.Trump has used the Stafford Act previously to deal with devastating wildfires in California and flooding in the Midwest.Trump later threatened to cut off FEMA funding for California unless the state’s forest management authorities “get their act together,” a threat which was widely condemned and one that was never carried out.OTHER MEASURESThe Department of Health and Human Services declared a public health emergency on January 31 which allowed the federal government to take measures to stem the outbreak.The move allowed Trump to impose a ban on visitors from China, Iran and mainland Europe and to place persons suspected of having contracted the coronavirus in quarantine.Trump said Friday that he was considering extending the travel ban to visitors from Britain.The governors of 33 of the 50 American states have already declared states of emergency because of coronavirus, giving them the power to take such steps as closing schools or banning public gatherings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-emergency-releases-50-bn-in-funds-to-fight-coronavirus-in-us/story-oVqOCgb430MFc4tqIC0veM.html
14-03-2020||World||China talks science but floats conspiracy theory on coronavirus origin||A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson on Friday refueled his allegation that the novel coronavirus has US military origins by citing a story from a website known to promote conspiracy theories to bolster his claim.Late on Thursday night, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian had tweeted to his large number of followers that the US military might be behind the covid-19 epidemic, and China, where it was first detected last year, wasn’t the origin of the virus.The covid-19 pandemic has gone to kill over 4000 and infect more than 1.32 lakh globally.“When did patient zero begin in US? How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals? It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation,” Zhao had tweeted in English and Chinese.2/2 CDC was caught on the spot. When did patient zero begin in US? How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals? It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation! pic.twitter.com/vYNZRFPWo3Zhao did not offer any evidence but referred to statement by a top US health official that a few flu-related deaths in the US that occurred earlier could have been caused by the coronavirus.1/2 CDC Director Robert Redfield admitted some Americans who seemingly died from influenza were tested positive for novel #coronavirus in the posthumous diagnosis, during the House Oversight Committee Wednesday. #COVID19 pic.twitter.com/vYNZRFPWo3On Friday, he doubled down on his claim by referring to a similar story from the Montreal-based Centre for Research on Globalisation, which says it’s an independent think-tank but is often called out for peddling outlandish theories including on 9/11.Sharing a link from the website, Zhao tweeted on Friday that “…this article is very much important to each and every one of us. Please read and retweet it. covid-19: Further Evidence that the Virus Originated in the US.”It led to a bit of a firestorm on Twitter with thousands sharing Zhao’s tweets and many trashing it, saying China was on the aggressive to help it cover up the fact had officials had covered-up information on the covid-19 in December and for nearly three weeks in January.The Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post (SCMP), in fact, reported on Friday, citing government documents that the first case of the infection was detected at the epicentre Wuhan in November.The SCMP report said Chinese health authorities had identified at least 266 people who contracted the virus last year.They were put under medical surveillance, and the earliest case was November 17 – weeks before authorities announced the emergence of the new virus, and then finally put in place containment measures.At the regular foreign ministry press conference, Zhao’s colleague, spokespersonGeng Shuang somewhat sidestepped questions on whether Beijing blames the US for the coronavirus.“The international community including the US has different opinions about the origin of the virus,” said Geng.“The origin of the virus is a scientific matter and as such scientific views should be listened to,” said Geng.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-talks-science-but-floats-conspiracy-theory-on-coronavirus-origin/story-KSogX5yXGvCSGrMPNfWzDO.html
14-03-2020||World||UK allows Maharashtra to retain Ambedkar Museum||The Boris Johnson government has allowed the government of Maharashtra to continue to use a property in north-west London as a museum in memory of B R Ambedkar, who lived there while studying at the London School of Economics in the 1920s.The house, 10 King Henry’s Road in Camden, was bought by the Maharashtra government in September 2015 for £3.1 million and inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in November 2015. Its use as a museum was later denied by the Camden council.Robert Jenrick, secretary of state for Housing, Communities and Local Government, said: “I was pleased to grant planning permission for a museum in London to Dr Ambedkar – one of the founding fathers of modern India and an important figure to many British-Indians”.The decision came following a public inquiry on September 24 and October 11 last, when lawyers for the Maharashtra government argued in favour of continuing to use the property as a museum to Ambedkar.The museum includes a statue, photo exhibition depicting his life and his books. It is managed by the Indian high commission on behalf of the Maharashtra government, and regularly attracts visitors from India and elsewhere.A blue plaque placed by English Heritage outside the house mentions Ambedkar living there while studying at the LSE. He first visited LSE in 1916, returned in 1921 and submitted his doctoral thesis titled ‘The Problem of the Rupee’ in March 1923.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-allows-maharashtra-to-retain-ambedkar-museum/story-68z7o9xbYHi7B0vjWZGQgM.html
14-03-2020||World||Spain to declare 2-week state emergency over coronavirus||With Italy already submerged in a national quarantine, Spain took a major step Friday toward a similar lock-down as it struggles to ride the wave of the coronavirus pandemic spawning illness and fear around the globe.Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said his government will declare a two-week state of emergency on Saturday, giving itself extraordinary powers including the mobilization of the armed forces, to confront the COVID-19 outbreak.“It’s an emergency that affects the life and health of all,” Sánchez said, adding that he is preparing a battery of measures to brace the nation for an even bigger jump in infections indicated by the rapidly increasing contagion curve.The positive cases could be over 10,000 by next week, the prime minister warned in his televised address, from more than 4,200 confirmed by midday Friday. A total 120 people have died, and 189 have been declared as recovered.A state of emergency allows the central government to limit free movement, legally confiscate goods and take over control of industries and private facilities, including private hospitals. It’s only the second time that the government has evoked it since the return of democracy in the late 1970s. The other was declared during a 2010 air traffic controllers’ strike.Over 60,000 people awoke Friday in four towns near Barcelona confined to their homes and with police blocking roads, in the country’s first mandatory lock-down. The southeastern region of Murcia since announced it was locking down coastal areas popular with tourists, a measure that could affect more than 350,000.And late in the evening, the regional authorities of Catalonia, in the northeast, and Madrid, urged central authorities to declare full lock-downs. Spain’s semi-autonomous regions control health and education but the national government holds key powers and manages most infrastructure.Over 70 countries, including neighboring Morocco, have restricted arrivals from Spain, which has so far only stopped flights with Italy. On Friday, the British government advised against all but essential travel to Spain’s La Rioja, parts of the Basque Country and the Madrid region, which has seen more than 2,000 positive cases of the new virus.With hospitals rapidly filling up, the Spanish capital is a source of particular concern.Unlike China, which cracked down quickly to restrict movement by people, Italy, Spain and other European countries have taken a more measured approach to strike a balance between the public health crisis and individual freedoms.Italian authorities have acknowledged that escalating restrictions have been unable to contain the virus. Italy this week has gone into complete quarantine with authorities threatening to impose heavy fines and even jail time for those who break it.The Madrid regional vice president said Friday that the capital is in dire need of medical supplies, despite announcing an unprecedented plan to reshuffle the region’s health system. That includes pooling intensive care units from both public and private hospitals and plans to create medical rooms in hotels.“We can’t let more days go. We already know what’s going to happen tomorrow and the day after tomorrow because we have the examples of China or Italy,” Ignacio Aguado told Spanish public broadcaster, TVE. “This is a silent hurricane.”The streets of downtown Madrid, normally bustling with commuters on an average Friday, were almost empty as the message from authorities to stay home took hold.Authorities had already shut down museums and sports centers, sent home nearly 10 million students and asked people to work remotely, while limiting crowds at public events in high-risk areas. But on Friday, they tightened the screw to close outdoor cafés first, and ultimately all commercial establishments except those selling food and essential items, such as drug stores.The region’s 2,659 cases and 86 deaths account for more than half of the national total.Yet officials and citizens in coastal areas have complained about the influx of people from Madrid in recent days, as some have taken advantage of the closing of schools in the capital or policies to “work from home” to take trips.“Stay at home, these are no holidays!” Fernando López Miras, the regional president of the southeast Murcia region, said after he announced that his government was prohibiting access to coastal areas popular for beachgoers Friday.“It’s shameful to see how the tourist information offices in Murcia were full of people from other regions this morning,” he said.For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus.In Igualada, a town of nearly 40,000 some 60 kilometers (37 miles) west of Barcelona that was put under mandatory confinement on Thursday night, the number of cases has almost tripled in 24 hours.Miguel Caballero, who runs a family restaurant in the town, said the lock-down was adding to the pain of having to juggle work and taking care of two children who have no school. Leaving them with grandparents was out of question because the elderly are considered a high-risk group.“The situation is serious but we are aware that this is going to help to halt the contagion here and to stop it from spreading,” Caballero said.The biggest concern is whether Spain’s largely public health system is able to sustain the sharp increase in cases, especially after years of austerity measures exhausted resources in hospitals and health centers. The central government on Thursday allocated an additional 3.8 billion euros ($4.2 billion) for reinforcing personnel and supplies for hospitals, as well as a 14-billion-euro ($15.6 billion) stimulus package for the economy.Public health expert Rafael Bengoa said private clinics may not be too much help because they rarely have intensive care beds, which is what is most desperately needed.“Look, this is not only going to be controlled by authorities, it is going to be controlled by social participation,” the doctor said, adding that Spain has the advantage of Italy’s experience and “more time” to prepare.“There will be tensions in Spanish hospitals in the next two, three weeks, but we have had time to mitigate the demand coming in,” Bengoa said.Sánchez finished his televised address on Friday with one final appeal to the nation of 46 million.“Victory depends on each one of us,” Sánchez said. “To be a hero also means to wash one’s hands and stay at home.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spain-to-declare-2-week-state-emergency-over-coronavirus/story-68Vs8L7r9dX6JZfgWXYymK.html
14-03-2020||World||US President Donald Trump declares national emergency over coronavirus pandemic||President Donald Trump declared a national emergency on Friday over the coronavirus outbreak, invoking the Stafford Act to open the door to more federal aid for states and municipalities.“I’m urging every state to open emergency operations centers,” Trump said at a press conference in the Rose Garden.The declaration allows the government to marshal additional resources to combat the virus. It also marks a symbolic turning point for the president, who has repeatedly compared the coronavirus to the seasonal flu and insisted that his administration had the outbreak under control.Senate Democrats had urged Trump to invoke the Stafford Act and other disaster declaration requests they say would free up more than $42 billion in funding for states available in the Disaster Relief Fund. Trump said it would open access to as much as $50 billion.An emergency declaration would allow a state to request a 75% federal cost-share for expenses that include emergency workers, medical tests, medical supplies, vaccinations, security for medical facilities, and more, according to a letter Democrats sent the president earlier this week.Only a few emergency declarations for public health threats have been made since the 1960s, and only two have targeted disease outbreaks, when President Bill Clinton in 2000 declared emergencies in New York and New Jersey in response to the West Nile Virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-donald-trump-declares-national-emergency-over-coronavirus-pandemic/story-4xWPCYpWqZBbqjze2CjSYI.html
