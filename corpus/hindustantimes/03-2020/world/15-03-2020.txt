15-03-2020||World||Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders in first one-on-one debate Sunday||Former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders will be squaring off for the first one-on-one debate of the Democratic presidential nominating contests on Sunday in the shadow of a coronavirus outbreak that has killed at least 59 people in the United States so far.Biden comes to the debate once again as a front-runner, buoyed by a string of recent victories in the Democratic president nominating contests. And Sanders will be looking to rescue and re-energize his campaign, badly battered from these defeats, some of them far worse than expected.Sunday night will be the first time the two candidates will face-off in a one-on-debate (Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard is still in the race, but has not qualified for the debate). Sanders has proven himself the better debater, more forceful, lucid and good with one-liners (“I wrote that Damn Bill”). Biden has been prone to making mistakes and fumbling for answers.But experts have pointed to the limited impact debates have had on the nominating contests. Senator Elizabeth Warren, for instance, dominated the last some debates — including an epic takedown of billionaire Michael Bloomberg — but could not translate them into electoral victories, and quit the race.The path forward for Sanders has been rapidly narrowing and the upcoming bunch of nominating contests in four states on Tuesday — Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio — hold not much good news for him. He has found little traction in Florida, for instance, the largest of them in terms of delegate count.Biden, on the other hand, is riding a momentum since his pivotal win in the South Carolina primaries. He went to win 10 of the 14 Super Tuesday states and picked up four of the six last week. Biden leads Sanders 885-732 in the count of delegates; the winner needs 1,991.Moderate Democrats are rapidly coalescing around his candidacy with with mounting urgency to end the race and let him and the party focus on beating President Donald Trump in the November elections. Calls have already started being made for Sanders to quit the race.The Sunday debate will be held without a live audience and the venue has been shifted from Arizona to Washington DC in view of the coronavirus outbreak, which has also forced the two candidates to call off campaign rallies and event. They have switched to digital town-halls and fire-side chats instead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-bernie-sanders-in-first-one-on-one-debate-sunday/story-0wxAYgooC3M0p67eeiQrwI.html
15-03-2020||World||WHO not part of Chinese probe into coronavirus origins, transmission||The World Health Organisation (WHO) is “extremely anxious” to know the origin of the pandemic-triggering novel coronavirus first found in the central Chinese city of Wuhan and is ready to help the ongoing Chinese investigation looking into the roots of the pathogen.So far, the WHO, which the world’s top UN body for public health, has not been involved in the multi-layered and critical probe – set up to find the virus’ animal origin and the exact sequencing of the animal-to-human interface.The coronavirus pandemic or the Covid-19 disease has until Sunday morning killed more than 5840 people and sickened over 157000 globally, a vast majority of them in China.“The WHO would be ready, but currently the investigation is being done by the government, into the origin (of the virus),” Gauden Galea, the organisation’s China representative said, adding “As far as we can see, we have not been involved in it”.“We are extremely anxious to know where the virus came from”.“The animal origins may take a very long time to identify. If you look at SARS, it took 10 years to identify the source after it happened; if you look at MERS, we are seven years down the line, and we are not yet sure still. So, this is not a story that is going to end quickly,” Galea said.“There are several areas where additional research and inquiry is necessary to help the global community respond to this outbreak and prevent an outbreak in the future. WHO has discussed the question of animal-origins of Covid-19 on multiple occasions and is prepared to join China’s efforts to research this issue”.Bats and pangolins have been said to be the source of the virus but scientists are still researching aspect, and whether an intermediate animal host played a part in the zoonosis.The initial sequences of the transmission aren’t clear either.For example, it’s not clear if the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan was the only source or there were multiple sources in the city, Galea, working at WHO since 1998, said.“There’s a big lesson that has been learned. But at this point, we still need that fuller investigation to know was it (the market) really the origin or was it one of the multiple events that had happened in Wuhan over a period? And that can only be done with further investigation,” Galea said.Galea said it was very important for the investigation to be done to ensure such an outbreak doesn’t recur from the same source – “and before it fades from memory”.“The epidemiology has to be done and, and chased through to the first case if it’s possible and to the first exposure,” Galea said in an interview with the HT in Beijing over the weekend.The WHO has been involved with the Chinese government in monitoring and containing the outbreak formally since January 3, preceded by three days of “informal” exchanges from December 31.By January 3, the WHO had put in place an “incident management team” comprising members from its Beijing office, regional headquarters in Manila and the Geneva headquarters.“We know for certain that there was a cluster associated with the Huanan seafood market (in Wuhan) in December. And, that was very clear. You can see that from the environmental samples, from the geographical distribution and from the time connections between the cases and so on. It was a very clear cluster,” Galea said.Not all cases were connected to the market, however.“We do know that even in the first cluster there were cases that were not reportedly associated with the seafood market and those cases need to be investigated”.“It is our understanding that the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention is looking into these cases. It is important to do this and do it fast before memories fade way. It is very important to be able to go back to the origins,” the WHO’s China head said.“Independent of who identifies, when identifies, the epidemiological investigations (into) the human side, as well as the human-animal interface, need urgent and detailed investigation,” Galea said.“We do not want whatever source originated it, to do it again unexpectedly.If you don’t have the sources, you are always open to it happening again. On this part, we cannot be more anxious to get the answers,” Galea said.Galea headed the first WHO team that went to Wuhan on January 20 and January 21. Later, in February, a WHO-China joint team also visited Wuhan and Beijing among other places. Galea hopes China will continue to share information.“We continue to ask questions,” Galea said, adding until now China has shared “a new package of knowledge” whenever identified by the authorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-not-part-of-chinese-probe-into-coronavirus-origins-transmission/story-qQhr0ZmRJ1NPdFRIagEmNN.html
15-03-2020||World||Coronavirus outbreak: Shopping frenzy in UK for toilet rolls, pasta, ‘dal’||“The world has gone mad, isn’t it”, an elderly shopper remarked as she jostled to reach the shelf with hand sanitizers, while the supermarket assistant exerted to make himself heard above the din: “Only two per person of everything, nothing more”.The scene on Sunday morning at one of the supermarket Tesco’s stores reflected the panic-buying across most of the UK after the Boris Johnson government announced that the country is about four weeks away from an Italy-like peak of the coronovirus outbreak.Ravi Singh, senior IT professional based in Maidenhead near London, travelled to Southall to buy ‘dal’ and other ingredients of Indian cooking, but struggled to get any. The usually well-stocked shops in the area known as ‘Little India’ had few on sale.“We went to our usual shops but most brands of ‘dal’ were not available. I’ve been here for nearly 20 years but never seen such scenes in Southall or other towns. People are just stocking up, not knowing what the future will bring”, Singh said.Toilet rolls, pasta, spaghetti and tinned food are among items in short supply. Many posted on social media images and visuals of empty shelves and long queues: of cars to enter car-parks of supermarkets and then before tills processing large shopping trolleys.Buy responsibly, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) urged shoppers on Sunday, assuring them that retailers are working round-the-clock to help customers get the products they need. Concerns grew, since the UK imports many of its food products from the EU.Helen Dickinson, BRC chief executive, said: “Retailers are working incredibly hard to keep shops well stocked and deliveries running as smoothly as possible”. “In the face of unprecedented demand as a result of coronavirus, food retailers have come together to ask their customers to support each other to make sure everyone can get access to the products they need.”Retailers such as Asda, Sainsbury’s, Waitrose and Boots have placed restrictions on the number of items people can buy in stores as well as on their websites, particularly wipes, anti-bacterial soaps, toilet rolls and hand sanitizers. Prices of some items have spiked due to the demand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-outbreak-shopping-frenzy-in-uk-for-toilet-rolls-pasta-dal/story-Oryx0HWrAdTj8NE9Dc8QMJ.html
15-03-2020||World||Europe widens coronavirus lockdown, moves to limit economic damage||Europeans were faced with increasingly draconian restrictions on public life Sunday, as governments tightened border controls to check the spread of the coronavirus and moved to limit damage to the continent’s fragile economies.With Europe now the epicenter of the outbreak, countries in the Schengen free-travel zone were considering restricting access to foreigners and asking residents to refrain from leaving, effectively sealing external frontiers, three officials familiar with the matter said.In Rome, the Italian government was weighing a new package of measures for Europe’s most-affected nation, including increased spending for its stricken health care sector, the postponement of some tax deadlines and aid for airlines.ALSO WATCH | Coronavirus: PM Modi offers $10 million for new fund at SAARC virtual meetGermany will close its borders with France, Switzerland and Austria on Monday at 8 a.m. local time, though goods and commuter traffic will still be allowed to flow, Bild newspaper and other media reported. Spokespeople for the German government and the interior ministry said they are unaware of the plan when contacted by Bloomberg.While one focus is checking the spread of the disease and limiting the strain placed on medical facilities, another is addressing the impact on economies. The European Central Bank unveiled a series of monetary measures Thursday that failed to pacify investors concerned that the euro-area is heading for recession.Markets recovered Friday as Germany pledged to spend whatever it takes to protect its economy and the European Commission said it’s ready to green light widespread fiscal stimulus.Still, HSBC Holdings Plc economists are among those declaring that a euro-area recession looks unavoidable. Italy and France were already contracting before the health emergency, while Germany had stalled.For the broader European Union, the European Commission last week said there could be a 1% contraction this year, which would be more severe than the downturn experienced during the sovereign debt crisis a decade ago.Earlier Sunday, Austria banned gatherings of more than five people and said it will close restaurants from Tuesday, while France announced reductions on domestic transport links by air, rail and bus, a day after closing restaurants, cafes and non-essential stores.That’s after Italy and Spain went into lockdown and many other governments have either already followed suit or are poised to.“The next weeks will be challenging, difficult and painful,” Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz told an emergency session of parliament. “We’re hoping that we, our society and our economy will be resurrected after Easter, and our life can go on as we love and cherish it.”Here are other European developments:- A 75-year-old Hungarian man became the nation’s first fatality from the virus, the government said.- Spain’s confirmed cases jumped to 7,753 on Sunday, from 5,753 on Saturday, and the death toll more than doubled to 288 from 136.- Italian authorities are attempting to halt an exodus of people from lockdown in the north to second residences or toward their families in the south, daily la Repubblica reported.- Lithuanian Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis pledged to announce a financial aid package of “no less” than 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) on Monday.- Estonia will bar everyone except for residents and their family members from entering the country from Tuesday.- Latvia will close borders, airports and ports to non-residents on Tuesday and ban all official events, with unofficial events capped at 50 people.- The Swiss government may provide additional economic support on top of its $10 billion COVID-19 aid package if the crisis worsens, Switzerland’s President Simonetta Sommaruga said in an interview with SonntagsZeitung.- Slovenia suspended all public transport from Sunday and the government is expected to close all bars and restaurants.- Poland has implemented full border controls and international flights are suspended. Cafes, bars, restaurants and shopping malls are closed.- The Czech government may place the entire nation into quarantine, Prime Minister Andrej Babis said.- Bulgaria will use its state-owned development bank to provide liquidity to businesses, Finance Minister Vladislav Goranov said in Sofia.- Greece closed its land borders with Albania and North Macedonia and stopped flights and sea arrivals from the two nations.- Cyprus announced a package of measures worth 700 million euros, or 3% of its gross domestic product, to support companies and workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-widens-coronavirus-lockdown-moves-to-limit-economic-damage/story-cqGTTpNiCF3NLA98XVSxYM.html
15-03-2020||World||Spain, France tighten controls as global deaths due to coronavirus pass 6,000||Cafes, shops and restaurants shut down across France and Spain on Sunday and travellers faced chaos at US airports as governments stepped up their fight against the coronavirus pandemic which has now reportedly killed more than 6,000.France ordered the closure of all non-essential businesses, while Spain went a step further and banned people from leaving home except to go to work, get medical care or buy food.Cases also spiked in Germany and sources told AFP that the government planned to shut its borders with France, Switzerland and Austria on Monday.Spain and France are among the worst-hit countries in Europe although Italy, which imposed Europe’s most draconian lockdown on its 60 million citizens last week, still dominates in terms of infections from COVID-19.A spike in deaths reported in Spain from 183 on Saturday to 288 on Sunday took the global toll to 6,036 from almost 160,000 infections, according to an AFP tally compiled from official sources.Experts warn, however, that the real figure is likely to be higher as tests are not available to everyone and people can be infected without showing symptoms.The disease has now hit all global regions, ripping up sporting and cultural calendars, causing panic in stock markets and companies -- particularly airlines -- and prompting often contradictory responses from governments.The United States imposed a travel ban on countries in Europe’s Schengen free-movement area last week, but has since said it would add Britain and Ireland to the list.China, where the disease originated, is now imposing its own crackdown on international travellers -- all will be put into quarantine on arrival -- after linking most of its new infections to those coming from overseas.As the virus continued its global spread, the plight of existing hotspots intensified.Iran announced 113 new deaths on Sunday taking its total to 724, the world’s third-worst toll after China and Italy, and officials urged people to avoid public gatherings.US travel spatThe US travel restrictions threw airports into disarray with passengers complaining of massive queues as staff battled with the new entry rules and stipulations on medical screening.One passenger, Ann Lewis Schmidt, told CNN passengers at Chicago’s O’Hare airport were held at “close quarters” when they arrived, adding: “So if we didn’t have the virus before, we have a great chance of getting it now.”Similar stories emerged on social media from passengers at Dallas and New York’s JFK.Illinois governor JB Pritzker said the queues at O’Hare were “unacceptable” and demanded that President Donald Trump take action. “The federal government needs to get its s@#t together. NOW,” he tweeted.Trump tested negative for the disease, having come into contact with several members of a Brazilian presidential delegation who have since tested positive.Governments in Europe also struggled to respond clearly.Britain, which had avoided crackdowns and instead tried to manage the spread and create “herd immunity”, cancelled local elections and hinted that it would follow most other affected European nations and ban mass gatherings.On the other hand, France allowed municipal elections to go ahead on Sunday even as officials imposed a drastic nationwide shutdown on all non-essential businesses and promised to progressively restrict long-distance travel.The risk from voting for the elderly was no greater “than going shopping”, insisted Jean-Francois Delfraissy, chairman of France’s coronavirus science council.Several countries have announced bans on foreigners entering their countries.Austria banned gatherings of more than five people on Sunday, telling citizens to stay in unless absolutely necessary.Norway announced it would shut ports and airports with international connections on Saturday before retreating a day later and saying although foreigners would be turned away the facilities would remain open. The isolated turn to musicThe spread of the virus has spooked even those countries without significant outbreaks -- with both Australia and New Zealand saying that anyone arriving from overseas must self-isolate for two weeks.“We are going to have to get used to some changes in the way we live our lives,” said Prime Minister Scott Morrison.Kazakhstan declared a state of emergency on Sunday despite having just eight confirmed infections. In Africa, which has been spared the worst of the disease, half a dozen countries announced new infections over the weekend.The announcements sparked restrictions on gatherings in Rwanda, panic-buying in the Seychelles and furious recriminations in Zimbabwe -- a country yet to register a single case. “Coronavirus is the work of god punishing countries who imposed sanctions on us,” said Zimbabwe’s defence minister Oppah Muchinguri on Saturday.Latin America has also recorded only small clusters of infections, though Colombia shut its border with Venezuela over a rise in cases there. Chile has also taken some protective measures -- quarantining more than 1,300 people aboard two cruise ships after an elderly Briton aboard one of them tested positive for the coronavirus.However, the cancelled events, closed schools and restrictions on movements have driven people to great lengths to avoid isolation and disappointment.Romans have been singing to each other from their apartments, and across the US on the weekend hundreds of youngsters posted their cancelled high-school musical numbers on social media under #SunshineSongs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spain-france-tighten-controls-as-global-deaths-due-to-coronavirus-pass-6-000/story-AYI7EaUCLt1LVmoFf86k3J.html
15-03-2020||World||Vatican’s ‘Holy Week’ to be held without public due to coronavirus||The Vatican’s Holy Week ceremonies will go ahead but without public attendance as Italy tries to contain the coronavirus outbreak, the Holy See said Sunday.Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said in a statement that “as far as Holy Week liturgical celebrations are concerned, I can specify that all are confirmed.”But Bruni added: “As things stand, under study are the ways they would be carried out and who would participate while respecting the security measures put in place to avoid spread of the coronavirus.” He added that in any case, faithful will be able to follow the ceremonies on TV, radio and through online media.Holy Week begins with Palm Sunday on April 5, culminating on Easter Sunday a week later, with tradition calling for an outdoor Masses in St. Peter’s Square on both Sundays. Tens of thousands of faithful usually turn out for the celebration.Italy is under severe lockdown, with the public restricted from leaving their homes except to buy food, go to work or a few other urgent reasons, and when outside must stay at least one metre (about three feet) away from each other. The disease for most people causes only mild or moderate symptoms. For some, it can cause more severe illness.It is not clear if the Italian decree’s restrictions will be extended well into April. But fear of spreading the virus could also jeopardize the traditional Way of the Cross procession on Good Friday on April 10 at the Colosseum, even without the public.In any case, virus fears and travel restrictions by many countries toward Italy have made tourism virtually vanish.With St. Peter’s Square closed to the public, and one case of infection reported by the Vatican recently, Pope Francis on Sunday delivered his traditional weekly commentary and blessing from the Apostolic Library instead of from a window overlooking the vast square.Francis praised priests for “creativity” in tending to their flocks, especially in the region of Lombardy, northern Italy, where thousands are hospitalized or in quarantine. He said their efforts demonstrated there are “a thousand ways to be near” to the faithful, if not physically.Some churches in Italy are being allowed to stay open for individual prayer, but all public Masses are forbidden during lockdown to discourage crowding.Francis didn’t cite the Rev. Giuseppe Corbari, pastor of San Robbiano church in the town of Giussano, 10 kilometers (six miles) from Milan, but he well could have.Corbari printed all the selfies he received from faithful and attached them to the church pews, offering a vivid reminder of the powerful sense of community among Catholics.Francis did single out for praise the Milan archbishop, who last week went atop the roof of the city’s iconic Duomo, or cathedral, to pray alone before a statue of the Madonna.As Spain followed Italy into lockdown mode to try and contain its own rapidly growing cases of COVID-19, churches in that similarly predominantly Roman Catholic country adopted measures akin to those done in Italy a few weeks ago.In Spain, faithful are allowed in the main chapel to pray but are given instructions to keep apart.Holy water bowls have been emptied. In one Madrid church, a confession room has been prepared since the usual confessional booths would mean the priest would be too close.In Germany, measures varied depending on the church and region.In heavily Catholic Bavaria, for example, the archdiocese of Munich cancelled services through April 3, while the dioceses of Bamberg and Regensburg have restricted services to 100 people. The Lutheran church in the region plans to continue offering services, but with a larger space between worshippers.“It is a difficult situation and it cuts into our church life,” Munich’s Catholic archbishop, Reinhard Marx, said last week. But he added: “This is not the end of prayer and pastoral care will still be there and present in urgent cases.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vatican-s-holy-week-to-be-held-without-public-due-to-coronavirus/story-KVwvlBumR1hUMBepm6FJQP.html

I think that’s, I think that’s a commendable initiative. Australia obviously supports that. I’ve communicated that,” Morrison said.Prime Minister Modi has proposed that the leaders of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries should hold a discussion via video conference to chalk out a joint strategy to fight coronavirus.The proposal was welcomed and endorsed by all SAARC nations and the video conference will be held later today.Morrison further said that he and Johnson have agreed to hold an urgent meeting with the G-20 Finance Ministers and Governors considering the economic impact of the pandemic.“The Prime Minister (Johnson) and I agreed last night that an even more urgent meeting that could be needed would be a further meeting of the G20 finance ministers and central bank governors. This is a health crisis, but it has very serious economic impacts,” Morrison said.Australia, the UK, and India are among more than 130 countries that have reported coronavirus cases.(This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

15-03-2020||World||Communist party member missing after criticising Xi’s handling of covid-19 outbreak||An influential former Chinese property executive who called President Xi Jinping a “clown” over a speech he made last month about the government’s efforts to battle the coronavirus has gone missing, three of his friends told Reuters. Ren Zhiqiang, a member of China’s ruling Communist Party and a former top executive of state-controlled property developer Huayuan Real Estate Group, has not been contactable since March 12, they said. “Many of our friends are looking for him,” his close friend and businesswoman Wang Ying said in a statement to Reuters, describing them as being “extremely anxious”.“Ren Zhiqiang is a public figure and his disappearance is widely know. The institutions responsible for this need to give a reasonable and legal explanation for this as soon as possible,” she said. Calls made by Reuters to Ren’s mobile phone went unanswered.The Beijing police did not immediately respond to requests by phone and fax for comment on Sunday. China’s State Council Information Office did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment.An essay Ren shared with people he knew in recent weeks took aim at a speech Xi made on Feb. 23, which state media reported was teleconferenced to 170,000 party officials nationwide. Copies of his essay were later posted online by others.In the essay, which does not mention Xi by name, Ren said after studying the speech he “saw not an emperor standing there exhibiting his ‘new clothes,’ but a clown stripped naked who insisted on continuing being emperor,” according to a version posted by China Digital Times, a U.S.-based website.He also said it revealed a “crisis of governance” within the party, and that a lack of free press and speech had prevented the outbreak from being tackled sooner, causing the situation to worsen. Ren’s disappearance comes as censorship over how local media and online users discuss the epidemic has tightened in recent weeks.The coronavirus, which emerged in China late last year, has infected more than 80,000 people in the country, killing 3,199. Ren, who gained the nickname “Cannon Ren” for previous critiques posted on social media, was put on probation from the party for a year in 2016 as part of a punishment for publicly criticising government policy. That year, the government ordered platforms such as the Twitter-like Weibo to shut down Ren’s social media accounts, which at the time had more than 30 million online followers, saying he had been “spreading illegal information”.Beijing has framed the battle against coronavirus as a “People’s War” led by Xi. While the draconian measures to fight the virus, including the lockdown of the city of Wuhan, have proven effective at containing it even as the disease spreads rapidly in other countries, China has faced criticism for suppressing information in the outbreak’s early days.

15-03-2020||World||Photo of worn-out nurse shows Italy health workers’ fatigue in virus fight||A worn-out nurse slumps over her keyboard in a widely shared image symbolic of the extreme fatigue that Italian healthcare workers are facing as they battle Europe’s worst outbreak of the novel coronavirus pandemic.The picture is of Elena Pagliarini, a nurse in the northern region of Lombardy which has been worst hit by the disease.Nationwide Italy has more than 1,400 deaths from the virus and 21,000 infections, with a quarter of the country’s intensive care beds taken up by those with the illness.In normal times Lombardy is the economic heart of Italy, equipped with one of the world’s best health systems.But those who staff it -- like Pagliarini -- have been put under enormous strain.“On one hand I was annoyed to see my photo everywhere, I was ashamed of showing my weakness,” Pagliarini told the Corriere della Sera newspaper.“But then I was happy because I got beautiful messages from people who empathised with my story,” she said.“I actually don’t feel physically tired, I can work for 24 hours straight if it’s necessary but I won’t hide the fact that right now I’m anxious because I’m fighting an enemy that I don’t know,” she added.She’s just one of many healthcare workers who have expressed their concern at the toll that the outbreak is taking, on facilities and personnel alike.“It’s almost two weeks since I’ve seen my son or my family because I’m worried about infecting them,” Daniele Macchini, a hospital doctor in the northern city of Bergamo, (also in Lombardy) wrote in a widely-shared Facebook post.“I settle for some photos of my son which I look at through my tears, and a few video calls,” he says.‘Psychologically tired’Further south in Tuscany, the health system is also starting to feel the pressure.A nurse in the Tuscan town of Grossetto, Alessia Bonari, posted an image on Instagram of her face bearing marks from a long day of wearing a surgical mask.“I’m worried because the mask might not be fitting right on my face, I might touch myself accidentally with dirty gloves, the glasses might not totally cover my eyes,” she wrote in the caption.She said that the protective gear staff had to wear meant that she couldn’t drink or go to the toilet for six hours at a time.To add to the physical fatigue she said she and all her colleagues had been “psychologically tired” for weeks from the workload.The San Giovanni Bosco hospital in the northern city of Turin this week put a mental health team in place to help its staff counter the stress of the current situation, above all for those working in emergency departments and in intensive care.“All those who need it can come forward, we’re there for everyone,” Monica Agnesone, one of the 20 psychologists in the team, told the La Stampa newspaper.She explained that other doctors and hospital staff were suffering from the “fear of making mistakes, of being infected, of not being able to carry on in these conditions”.On Thursday Italian media reported that in the northern town of Bergamo alone around 50 doctors had tested positive for the virus.Further south in a hospital in the Puglia region,local media reported that 76 employees had to go into quarantine after being in contact with patients who tested positive for the virus.Six of them had to be admitted to hospital, with one needing intensive care.Agnesone’s strategies for coping with the stress will no doubt be increasingly called on in the weeks to come.She recommends “carving out moments where you can detach, re-centre yourself, lowering the level of tension by using breathing exercises and focusing on other things.”Otherwise, she warns, “stress ends up wearing out your energy”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/photo-of-worn-out-nurse-shows-italy-health-workers-fatigue-in-virus-fight/story-Xyfbm5SUyzx72b6cWnWj7O.html
15-03-2020||World||Britain’s biggest grocers ask their shoppers to stop stockpiling||British food retailers have written a joint letter to their customers asking them to “buy responsibly” in the wake of shoppers stockpiling over fears about the new coronavirus.In an extraordinary development, 12 of Britain’s biggest grocers will publish advertisements in national newspapers today and tomorrow. Entitled “Working to Feed the Nation,” the letter reassures shoppers about steps being taken to ensure adequate supplies in stores and asks them to be considerate: “We understand your concerns but buying more than is needed can sometimes mean that others will be left without. There is enough for everyone if we all work together.”The supermarkets behind the letter include the “Big Four” -- Tesco Plc, J Sainsbury Plc, WM Morrison Plc and Asda Group Ltd -- as well as the discounters Aldi and Lidl. Other retailers that have signed up include Marks & Spencer Plc, online grocer Ocado and Waitrose.The spread of the coronavirus across Europe, which is now the epicenter of the pandemic according to the World Health Organization, has fueled the urge to stockpile. Tesco, Britain’s largest grocer, has already had to move to restrict sales of antibacterial products, dried pasta, long-life milk, children’s medicines, water and tinned vegetables to five items a person in stores. Other grocers have restrictions in place too.Earlier this week, the government also eased time restrictions on delivery trucks in built-up areas so that supermarkets can restock their shelves at night.Helen Dickinson, chief executive officer of the British Retail Consortium, the industry trade body, said U.K. grocers are working “incredibly hard” to keep shops well-stocked but added: “In the face of unprecedented demand as a result of coronavirus, food retailers have come together to ask their customers to support each other to make sure everyone can get access to the products they need.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-s-biggest-grocers-ask-their-shoppers-to-stop-stockpiling/story-USa8UFmImvnd1TS4SlHtNN.html
15-03-2020||World||Coronavirus will change the way we shop, travel and work for years||Every economic shock leaves a legacy. The deadly coronavirus will be no different.The great depression spurred a “waste not want not” attitude that defined consumer patterns for decades. Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic still haunts German policy.The Asia financial crisis left the region hoarding the world’s biggest collection of foreign exchange. More recently, the 2008 global financial crisis drove a wedge through mature democracies that still reverberates, with workers suffering measly pay gains in the decade since.This time it’s a public health emergency that’s shaking up the world economy. In just a matter of weeks, people in affected areas have become accustomed to wearing masks, stocking up on essentials, cancelling social and business gatherings, scrapping travel plans and working from home. Even countries with relatively few cases are taking many of those precautions.Also read: Coronavirus pushes China’s poor rat meat farmers to brink of despairTraces of such habits will endure long after the virus lockdowns ease, acting as a brake on demand. On the supply side, international manufacturers are being forced to rethink where to buy and produce their goods -- accelerating a shift after the US-China trade war exposed the risks of relying on one source for components.In the white-collar world, workplaces have amped up options for teleworking and staggered shifts -- ushering in a new era where work from home is an increasing part of people’s regular schedule.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here“Once effective work-from-home policies are established, they are likely to stick,” said Karen Harris, managing director of consultancy Bain’s Macro Trends Group in New York.Universities stung by travel bans will diversify their foreign student base and schools will need to be better prepared to keep educating online when breakouts force their closure.The tourism sector is seeing the most drastic hit, with flights, cruises, hotels and the web of businesses who feed off the sector struggling. While tourists will no doubt be eager to explore the world and relax on a beach again, it may take some time before the industry that hires about one in 10 people recovers.Also read: Amid coronavirus worry, Railways advises people to bring their own blanketsThe virus has also turned the economic policy outlook on a dime and created new priorities. Central banks are in emergency mode again, while governments are digging ever deeper to find money to prop up struggling sectors. Hygiene is soaring up government and corporate agendas -- indeed, Singapore already plans to introduce mandatory cleaning standards.“This outbreak is unprecedented in terms of its nature of uncertainty and associated social and economic impact,” said Kazuo Momma, who used to be in charge of monetary policy at the Bank of Japan. Tighter borders controls, wider insurance coverage and lasting changes to working and commuting patterns will be just some of the micro-economic changes that will endure long after the virus, Momma says.In China, where the virus first erupted in Wuhan late last year, the top legislature has already imposed a total ban on trade and consumption of wild animals amid scientists’ warnings that the deadly coronavirus migrated from animals to humans. Additional strict hygiene rules are expected that will accelerate a push by wary consumers to online shopping, similar to how the 2003 SARS outbreak changed shopping habits as people avoided the mall.Also read: Coronavirus positive Delhi man, 46, came in contact with 813 peopleAnalysis by Bain & Company found that China will see pronounced immediate changes in health care as more and more rudimentary checkups and transactions are conducted through online channels to avoid the risk of contamination in crowded waiting rooms and wards.Governments may spend much more on health care to avoid the massive cost associated with epidemics, according to a new paper on the macroeconomic impact of the virus published by the Brookings Institution and co-authored by Warwick McKibbin and Roshen Fernando of the Australia National University.“The global community should have invested a great deal more on prevention in poor countries,” McKibbin said. He was also co-author of a previous paper that estimated the 2003 SARS outbreak wiped $40 billion off the world economy.Because no one knows how the virus will play out or what the final human and economic toll will be, economists caution against concrete predictions. It could be that much of the disruption will revert to normal activity once the outbreak is contained, according to Nobel laureate Edmund Phelps of Columbia University.Also read: Is India doing enough to check community spread?“I think most businesses and certainly the behemoths in the US and elsewhere will not fail to go back to normal business practices,” he said.Economists like Paul Sheard, a senior fellow at Harvard University’s Kennedy School, also caution that because no two economic shocks are the same, it’s far from certain what legacy this one will leave.Fabrizio Pagani, a former adviser to the Prime Minister of Italy, draws on previous shocks for guidance.“The oil supply shock in the 70s led to the first efforts of energy conservation and efficiency,” he said. “The demand shock determined by the great financial crisis was the rationale for a new, quite radical, regulatory framework across the banking and financial sectors.”This time around, he expects changes to everything from online schooling and distance learning to industrial strategy as existing business models are reworked.A triple convergence of Brexit, the US China trade war and now Covid-19 could reshape the world’s manufacturing supply chains, according to Michael Murphree, of the University of South Carolina’s Darla Moore School of Business.Kathryn Judge, a financial markets and regulation expert at Columbia University, says the U.S. banking crash of 2008 has left deep scars by fueling divisive politics and declining levels of home ownership. The current crisis, as nations around the world take emergency steps to shield citizens from coronavirus infection, will have an impact too.“Long-brewing debates about how to revamp the US health-care system might benefit from a renewed sense of urgency, enabling structural change,” Judge said.How that plays out on the political stage will be key. Would-be Democratic nominee Joe Biden is pushing a plan that would build upon Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act. President Donald Trump, meantime, is downplaying the risk to the U.S. economy posed by the coronavirus and sought to cast blame for the pandemic at other countries for what he labeled a “foreign virus.”James Boughton, who served for decades at the International Monetary Fund, including as the fund’s historian, cites the collapse in South Korea and Indonesia as catalysts for change, provided governments act.“Only in a crisis are governments able to rally people to accept necessary but painful reforms,” said Boughton. “Every crisis is also an opportunity.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-will-change-the-way-we-shop-travel-and-work-for-years/story-nwMuJQMH9mEkx9k7FHYL0L.html
15-03-2020||World||Coronavirus pushes China’s poor rat meat farmers to brink of despair||Bamboo rat meat, a once profitable commodity China’s poor traded for quick returns, now risks pushing those farmers back into poverty.Many local governments had encouraged impoverished citizens to breed the animal, offering financial incentives as part of poverty-relief measures. But Beijing has now clamped down on trading wild animals due to the coronavirus, potentially destroying the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of farmers.“Many breeders are poor farmers living in mountainous areas, and have no other income,” said Cheng Bujun, who runs a rat farm in the Guangxi region. “Some of them are disabled or elderly who can hardly find jobs in cities.”His company buys baby rats from these farmers who were given parent rats for free by local authorities, Cheng said. Breeding the rats is the only source of revenue for his contract farmers who live in a poor village in the southwest province of Guizhou, and the ban will return them to poverty, he said.China has a target of lifting more than 5 million people in rural areas out of poverty by the end of this year, but the coronavirus epidemic, which is widely believed to have spread from a wild animal and seafood market in the city of Wuhan, could derail those plans. Stopping the bamboo rat meat trade alone puts an end to an annual business worth $1.4 billion.“Some parts of China have been breeding bamboo rats for the last 30 years,” said Liu Kejun, a senior researcher with the Guangxi Animal Husbandry Research Institute. “Artificially-bred bamboo rats are different from wild ones” and should be strictly monitored, but not banned, he said.GOOD PROFITSThe rats provide quick returns due to their low investment costs, and are the most effective way of getting farmers out of poverty, Liu said. The animals only eat bamboo and sugarcane and can be bred in small spaces. A rural family that rears 20 rat pairs can make 10,000 yuan to 15,000 yuan ($1,430 to $2,150) the following year, he said, way above the country’s poverty level and enough for a rural family to live on.Since China last month moved to ban all wild animals for consumption, the agricultural ministry has been updating a list of exempt animals. Liu and large breeders sent a proposal to Beijing to ask the government to include bamboo rats on the list, according to a document seen by Bloomberg.There are about 66 million artificially-bred bamboo rats in China. In Guangxi, the annual market value of the animal is about 2.8 billion yuan. Of the 180,000 breeders in the region, nearly 20% are from low-income rural families, according to the proposal.VIRUS CONCERNSStill, the prospect of bamboo rats being added to the list is slim given that the country’s top infectious disease expert, Zhong Nanshan, said in January that bamboo rats and badgers are among the wild animals that could be the source of the new coronavirus.Farms that are breeding animals on the banned list will be shut down or compensated to switch to other businesses, Liu Yongfu, head of the State Council Leading Group Office of Poverty Alleviation and Development, said at a press conference on Thursday. Closing down the artificial breeding business won’t have a major impact on the country’s poverty relief target, he said.Bamboo rat meat is popular in the southern Chinese provinces of Guangxi, Guangdong, Hunan and Jiangxi, and was once promoted as a top 10 delicacy for tourists to try when visiting the Jinggang Mountains.A rat can produce 1.5 to 2 kilograms of meat, Guangxi Animal Husbandry’s Liu said. The meat can be stewed in soy sauce, or used in soups or barbecued.“A table filled with bamboo rat meat dishes only costs about 300 yuan for six or seven people,” Liu said. “It tastes very delicious.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-pushes-china-s-poor-rat-meat-farmers-to-brink-of-despair/story-OFbZ3CG5eoDKwNMh43Y9iJ.html

Both are now in their residence, following the health authorities’ advice.Spain has had over 6,250 confirmed cases of the COVID-19 illness and 193 people have died.This comes hours after Sanchez imposed a nationwide lockdown, preventing citizens from leaving their homes except to buy food and medicine, for work or emergencies.The step means all restaurants, bars, hotels, non-essential retail outlets, and education centres will be shut nationwide.The measures are set to come into effect on Monday morning, RT reported.The measures, which Sanchez called “extraordinary” and “drastic” will last for 15 days as part of the state of emergency and may be extended further with a decision from the Spanish Congress of Deputies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/begona-gomez-wife-of-spanish-pm-has-coronavirus-spain-pmo/story-o4kaCSFV5Js5qxqOCATWKK.html
15-03-2020||World||US President Donald Trump tests negative for coronavirus||President Donald Trump has tested negative for the new coronavirus, according to the president’s personal physician.The White House released the test results Saturday night after Trump told reporters hours earlier that he had taken the coronavirus test, following days of resisting being screened despite the fact that he had been in recent contact with three people who have tested positive for the virus.Trump told reporters at a White House briefing on Saturday that he had his temperature taken and it was “totally normal,” shortly before stepping into the room to discuss the government’s efforts to halt the spread of the virus. The pandemic has now infected more than 2,200 people in the US and caused at least 50 deaths.Watch | US President Donald Trump tests negative for COVID-19; defends handshakingThe president had multiple direct and indirect contacts with people who have since tested positive for the virus, including three people he spent time with last weekend at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida.The Brazilian Embassy in Washington said late Friday that the country’s chargé d’affaires, Nestor Forster, tested positive after sitting at Trump’s dinner table. So, too, have a top aide to Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who took a photo with Trump and attended a party with him, and another person who attended a campaign fundraiser with the president that Sunday, according to two Republican officials who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss private health matters.Trump, after days of insisting that he was not exhibiting symptoms of the virus, relented after being pressed by reporters about his resistance to testing when multiple lawmakers and countless citizens across the country who have had the same degree of exposure have not only tried to get tested, but also chosen to try to avoid potentially infecting others.The president, according to two people close to the White House, had been reluctant to take the test for fear it would project weakness or worry. Trump has wanted to appear in full control during the crisis, and had expressed concerns that taking personal steps could undermine that appearance.Trump came into office as self-described germaphobe who tried to avoid handshakes as he conducted his real estate business. But he acknowledged Saturday that he’s now finding it difficult to resist shaking hands, a habit that he says he’s picked up since becoming a full-time politician.At a news conference Friday to announce he was declaring a national emergency, Trump eagerly shook the hands of several corporate executives, even though health policy experts on White House coronavirus task force have urged Americans to avoid physical contact to help stem the spread of the virus.“People come up to me, they shake hands, they put their hand out,” Trump said. “It’s sort of a natural reflex, and we’re all getting out of it. All of us have that problem.”The White House is stepping up efforts to try to keep the virus at bay.On Saturday, the White House announced that it is now conducting temperature checks on anyone who is in close contact with Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, including reporters who attend a White House briefing and anyone entering the Oval Office.Pence also wrote a memo to White House staff Saturday reminding them to take precautions such as avoiding physical contact, washing hands frequently and staying home when sick.“It’s imperative each one of us do our part to take the proper precautions to keep ourselves and our colleagues safe,” Pence wrote. “As an employee aboard the White House Complex, we have an additional duty to protect the health of our Executive Branch and those working with us.”Dr. Deborah Birx, who is helping coordinate the US response to the outbreak, noted that testing results reflect a snapshot in time and that it’s crucial for people to maintain precautions.“When you get a negative test, that means you’re negative that day,” Birx said. “That doesn’t mean that you couldn’t get the virus spreading overnight, because it replicates in your nose and your nasal secretions, and you would have a positive test tomorrow.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/doctor-says-trump-tested-negative-for-coronavirus/story-iHRQ4YKNyict2f0vv0dTiI.html

Two people have already died in Sweden and two in Norway.Denmark also became the latest country to take dramatic steps to stop the spread of the COVID-19 disease, closing its borders to all non-resident foreigners for a month.“All tourists and foreigners who cannot prove that they have a valid reason to come to Denmark will not be allowed to enter,” Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Friday when the ban was announced.Police said that around 20 people were refused entry after the measure came into effect at noon Saturday (1100 GMT).At Copenhagen airport, passengers said that strict controls were in place for those entering the country.Only Danes and other permanent residents were let through, as well as others with a “compelling reason” to come into the country.Trade imports and exports are not affected.The government on Wednesday unveiled a string of measures to limit the impact of the pandemic, which has now seen more than 150,000 worldwide infected with COVID-19 and caused over 5,000 deaths.Schools, universities and libraries have been closed in Denmark and civil servants have been asked to stay at home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/denmark-announces-first-coronavirus-death-closes-borders-to-foreigners/story-ip8jfKE70YPlqS06EW7KtN.html
